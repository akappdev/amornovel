He had a long drive to Los Angeles and meant to get an early start. Depending on traffic around the Bay Area, the drive would be eight to ten hours from Virgin River. He locked up his RV, which was his home. It sat on the property at Jack\u2019s bar and grill; Jack and Preacher would keep an eye on it for him, not that Mike expected any kind of trouble. That was one of several reasons he\u2019d chosen to live here\u2014it was quiet. Small, peaceful, beautiful and nothing to disturb one\u2019s peace of mind. Mike had had enough of that in his former life.</p><p>Before coming to Virgin River permanently, Mike had made many trips to this Humboldt County mountain town for hunting and fishing, for gathering with an old Marine squad that was still close. His full-time job had been with LAPD, a sergeant in the gangs division. That had all ended when he was shot on the job\u2014he\u2019d taken three bullets and had a lot of hard work getting his body back. He\u2019d needed Preacher\u2019s robust food and Jack\u2019s wife Mel\u2019s assistance with physical therapy on his shoulder. After six months, Mike was as close to completely recovered as he\u2019d get.</p><p>Since moving to Virgin River he\u2019d been home only once to visit his parents, siblings and their families. He planned to take a week\u2014one day driving each way and five days with that crowd of laughing, dancing Mexicans. Knowing the traditions of his family, it would be a nonstop celebration. His mother and sisters would cook from morning to night, his brothers would stock the refrigerator with cerveza, family friends and cop buddies from the department would drop by the house. It would be a good time\u2014a great homecoming after his long recovery.</p> <p>He was three hours into his drive when his cell phone rang. The noise startled him. There was no cell phone reception in Virgin River so the last thing he expected was a phone call.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cI need a favor,\u201d Jack said without preamble. His voice sounded gravelly, as though he was barely awake. He must not have remembered Mike was heading south.</p><p>Mike looked at the dash clock. It wasn\u2019t yet 7:00 a.m. He laughed. \u201cWell, sure, but I\u2019m nearly in Santa Rosa, so it might be inconvenient to run over to Garberville and get you ice for the bar, but hey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, it\u2019s Brie,\u201d Jack said. Brie was Jack\u2019s youngest sister, his pet, his favorite. And she was really special to Mike. \u201cShe\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Mike actually swerved on the highway. \u201cHold on,\u201d he said. \u201cStay there.\u201d He pulled off the road onto a safe-looking shoulder. Then he took a deep breath. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe was assaulted sometime last night,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBeaten. Raped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Mike said. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t repeat himself. \u201cMy father just called a little while ago. Mel and I are packing\u2014we\u2019ll get on the road as soon as we can. Listen, I need someone who knows law enforcement, criminology, to walk me through what\u2019s happening with her. They don\u2019t have the guy who did this\u2014there\u2019s got to be an investigation. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad is she?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cMy dad didn\u2019t have a lot of details, but she\u2019s out of emergency and in a room, sedated and semiconscious, no surgery. Can you write down a couple of numbers? Can you keep your cell phone turned on so I can call you? With questions? That kind of thing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. Yes,\u201d Mike said. \u201cGimme numbers.\u201d</p><p>Jack recited phone numbers for the hospital, Jack\u2019s father, Sam, and Mel\u2019s old cell phone that they\u2019d charge on their way to Sacramento and then carry with them.</p><p>\u201cDo they have a suspect? Did she know the guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything except her condition. After we get on the road, get the phone charged and we\u2019re out of the mountains and through the redwoods, I\u2019ll call my dad and see what he can tell me. Right now I gotta go. I gotta get down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Mike said. \u201cOkay. My phone will be in my pocket twenty-four-seven. I\u2019ll call the hospital, see what I can find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Appreciate it,\u201d Jack said, hanging up.</p><p>Mike sat on the shoulder, staring at the phone for a long minute, helpless. Not Brie, he thought. Oh God, not Brie!</p><p>His mind flashed on times they\u2019d been together. A couple of months ago she\u2019d been in Virgin River to see her new nephew, Jack and Mel\u2019s baby. Mike had taken her on a picnic at the river\u2014to a special place where the river was wide, but too shallow for fishermen to bother. They\u2019d had lunch against a big boulder, close enough to hear the water whisper by as it passed over the rocks. It was a place frequented by young lovers and teenagers, and that big old rock had seen some wonderful things on the riverbank; it protected many secrets. Some of his own, in fact. He\u2019d held Brie\u2019s hand for a long time that day, and she hadn\u2019t pulled it away. It was the first time he\u2019d realized he was taken with her. A crush. At thirty-seven, he felt it was an old man\u2019s crush, but damned if it didn\u2019t feel awfully like a sixteen-year-old\u2019s.</p> <p>When Mike met Brie for the first time a few years back, he\u2019d gone to see her brother while Jack was on leave, visiting his family in Sacramento right before his last assignment in Iraq. Mike was oblivious to the fact that his reserve unit would be activated and he\u2019d end up meeting Jack over there, serving under him a second time. Brie was there, of course, recently married to a Sacramento cop. Nice guy, so Mike had thought. She was a prosecutor for the county in Sacramento, the state capital. She was small, about five-three, with long, soft brown hair that flowed almost to her waist, making her look like a mere girl. But she was no girl. She put away hardened criminals for a living; she had a reputation as one of the toughest prosecutors in the county. Mike had immediately admired her brains, her grit, not to mention her beauty. In his past life, before the shooting, he\u2019d never been particularly discouraged by the mere presence of a husband, but they were newlyweds, and Brie was in love. No other man existed for her.</p><p>When Mike saw her in Virgin River right after Jack\u2019s son was born, she was trying to recover from a painful divorce\u2014her husband had left her for her best friend, and Brie was shattered. Lonely. So hurt. Mike immediately wanted to take her into his arms and console her, for he was hurting, too. But Brie, crushed by her husband\u2019s infidelity, was determined not to put her heart on the line again, and she wanted nothing of a man, especially another player who\u2019d had more than his share of women. A further complication\u2014this was Jack\u2019s baby sister, of whom he was so protective it verged on ridiculous. And Mike was no longer a driven, devil-may-care Latino lover. He was a cripple. The body just didn\u2019t work right anymore.</p><p>It had been only a couple of weeks since he\u2019d last seen her. She had come back to Virgin River with the rest of her family to help erect the frame of Jack\u2019s new house. Preacher and his bride, Paige, were married in that framed structure the very next day. For a man who could barely walk six months ago, Mike had given Brie a fairly decent twirl around the dance floor at the wedding. It was a fantastic party\u2014full of that good old country food, barbecues flaming, the chairs pushed back and the band set up on the foundation of Jack\u2019s unfinished house, the frame strung with floral garlands. He grabbed her, laughing, into his arms and whirled her around with abandon, and whenever the tempo allowed, pressed his cheek close against hers, whispering in conspiratorial amusement, \u201cYour brother is frowning at us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder why that is.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he wants you near a man so like himself,\u201d Mike speculated.</p><p>That seemed to amuse her a great deal. She tipped her head back and laughed a little wildly. \u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has nothing to do with your great success with women. You\u2019re a man, near his baby sister. That\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no baby,\u201d he said, pulling her closer. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re having too much fun with this, getting him riled up. Don\u2019t you realize he has a dangerous temper?\u201d</p><p>Unmistakably, she held him tighter. \u201cNot toward me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a devil in you,\u201d he said, and looked death in the face by kissing her neck.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fool in you,\u201d she said, tilting her head just slightly to give him more of her neck.</p><p>In years gone by he would have found a way to get her alone, seduced her, made love to her in ways she\u2019d dream about later. But three bullets had decided a few things. Even if he could spirit her away from her brother\u2019s protective stare, he wouldn\u2019t be able to perform. So he said, \u201cYou\u2019re trying to get me shot again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I doubt he\u2019d actually shoot you. But I haven\u2019t been to a good old-fashioned wedding brawl in ages.\u201d</p><p>When they\u2019d said goodbye he had hugged her briefly, her sweet scent like a cinch around his mind, feeling her cheek against his, his arms around her waist, pulling her close. A bit more than just a friendly gesture\u2014a suggestive one, which she returned. He assumed she was having fun with the flirtation, stirring things up a little bit, but it meant far more than that to him. Brie held his thoughts in a disturbing way that suggested if he were capable of giving her love, she would capture his heart and mind in that powerful way that wipes all other women out of the past. He really didn\u2019t have that to offer anymore. Although that didn\u2019t keep him from thinking about her, wanting her.</p><p>He could not bear to think about all that mischief and sass lying broken and violated in a hospital. His heart was in pieces, aching for her. Dying to know that she was going to be all right.</p><p>He put the SUV into Drive, looked over his shoulder and got back on the freeway. He gunned the engine and veered across two lanes of fast-moving traffic to make the exit to Sacramento.</p><p>When Mike got to the county hospital a couple of hours later, he called Sam\u2019s cell phone number and left a message to say he\u2019d arrived and wanted to know where they were. A prosecutor, the victim of a crime, was not going to be with the general population\u2014she would undoubtedly have security.</p><p>Sam came to the hospital entrance, extending his hand. \u201cMike. Good of you to come. I know Jack will appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was on my way south and was almost here anyway. Brie\u2019s a special friend. I\u2019ll do anything I can.\u201d</p><p>Sam turned and headed for the elevators. \u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m not sure what you can do. She\u2019s going to be all right. Physically. I have no idea what a woman goes through after something like this....\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you know so far,\u201d Mike said. \u201cDid she know her attacker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Remember that terrible trial she had about the same time Jack\u2019s son was born? The serial rapist? The media circus? It was him. She identified him for police.\u201d</p><p>Mike stopped walking and frowned. \u201cShe\u2019s sure?\u201d he asked. That was such a sick, bold move for someone who\u2019d just gotten a free pass. Brie had lost that trial and it was a hard loss, especially coming on the heels of her divorce. It was as if the sky was falling on her. Also, it wasn\u2019t something men like that did. Typically, they bolted. Got away from anyone who had the balls to go after them, as Brie had.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sure,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Mike couldn\u2019t help but wonder\u2014was she hit in the head? Hallucinating? In and out of reality because of the trauma? \u201cHer injuries?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHer face is battered, there are two broken ribs and the usual...\u201d He paused. \u201cThe usual injuries incurred during a rape. You know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. Tearing, bleeding, bruising. \u201cHas she been seen by a rape specialist and police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she wants Mel. Understandably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Mike said. Jack\u2019s wife, Mel, was the nurse practitioner and midwife in Virgin River and had had years of experience in a huge L.A. trauma center. She was an expert in battery and sexual assault and if she could be the medical eyes and ears, maybe Mike could cover the police angle. \u201cI heard from them at seven this morning. They should be here in two or three hours, depending on how fast they got out of town.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mike noticed a uniformed Sac PD officer standing at the entrance to a room; undoubtedly that\u2019s where Brie was. \u201cWell, let me talk to some people, see if I can find out anything at all. But first, I\u2019ll say hello to the family.\u201d He moved to a large clot of people in the waiting area just down the hall. Jack\u2019s three other sisters, their husbands, a few of his nieces. Mike was embraced and thanked. Then he got about the business of talking to nurses, got the number of the detective on the case from the officer guarding the room. All the detective could tell Mike at this time was that the suspect was still at large. The doctor would discuss her injuries, that was all. But it appeared that apart from being horribly assaulted, she would recover physically.</p><p>It was almost three hours later that Jack, Mel and baby David arrived. Jack embraced his father, then looked in surprise at Mike. \u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was already close,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d come over. If I can help, it\u2019s better for me to be on-site.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, man, I didn\u2019t expect this,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cHell, you\u2019ve done more for me,\u201d Mike said. \u201cAnd you know I love Brie. Mel,\u201d he said, reaching for baby David, \u201cshe said she wants to see you the minute you get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Mel said, handing off the baby.</p><p>\u201cI think she needs Mel\u2019s opinion of how the rape evidence was collected,\u201d Mike said to Jack. \u201cGo hug your sisters. By that time you\u2019ll be able to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen her yet?\u201d Jack asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s family only. But I\u2019ve talked to some people, trying to gather whatever facts they\u2019ll share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Jack said, gripping Mike\u2019s biceps hard. \u201cThanks. Mike, I didn\u2019t expect this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have.\u201d He laughed, jostling little David a little. \u201cThat\u2019s how it is with us. Right?\u201d</p><p>Jack sat by his sister\u2019s bedside at the county hospital for almost twelve straight hours. He had arrived at eleven in the morning and it was now 11:00 p.m. Outside her door, in the hallway, the family had gathered for most of the day, but as evening had descended they\u2019d drifted home because she was out of danger and sedated. Mike had taken Mel and the baby back to Sam\u2019s, but Jack hadn\u2019t wanted to leave Brie. Brie was close to her entire family, but it was Jack with whom she had the deepest bond.</p><p>Jack was torn to pieces as he looked down on his little sister. Her face was horrific; the bruising and swelling was terrible. It looked much worse than it was, the doctor promised. There was no permanent damage; she would regain her former beauty. Every few minutes Jack would reach over, gently smooth back her light brown hair, touch her hand. She wrestled in her sleep now and then, despite the sedatives. If not for the ribs, he might have taken her into his strong arms during these struggles. Instead he would lean over her bed, touch her face where there was no swelling, drop a tender kiss on her forehead and whisper, \u201cI\u2019m here, Brie. You\u2019re safe now, baby.\u201d</p><p>At almost midnight he felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to look up into Mike\u2019s black eyes.</p> <p>\u201cGo on home, Jack,\u201d he said. \u201cGet a little rest. I\u2019ll sit with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave her,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to. But I had a nap,\u201d he lied. \u201cSam gave me a room at the house. I\u2019ll sit right here in case she wakes up, which she probably won\u2019t, and we\u2019ve got the cop in the hall there. Go. Get a little rest so you can be here for her tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she wakes up and I\u2019m not right here...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re putting heavy-duty bug juice right in the IV to get her through the night,\u201d Mike said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed a little. \u201cI sat by your bed through a week of nights when you were shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mike said. \u201cPayback time. Go home to your wife. See you first thing tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>It surprised Mike that Jack actually left. He was the kind of man who went days past exhaustion to be there for someone he cared about. Mike took his place on a chair beside Brie\u2019s bed and sat vigil. Her battered face didn\u2019t shock him\u2014he\u2019d seen worse. But it hurt him inside. He couldn\u2019t imagine the kind of monster who could do that.</p> <p>The nurses came and went through the night, checking her IV, taking her blood pressure, sometimes bringing Mike coffee from their break room\u2014and it tasted a whole lot better than what the machines dispensed. If he asked, a nurse would sit with Brie while he ran down the hall\u2014a result of the coffee. But Brie didn\u2019t move except for some occasional disturbances that caused her to stir fitfully.</p><p>Mike had carried fallen soldiers out of harm\u2019s way; he\u2019d sat by the side of dying men while sniper fire whizzed past his head. But nothing compared to what he felt while looking down at Brie, beaten like this. Thinking of her violation filled him with a kind of rage that had never been visited on him before. Although she was a beautiful woman and strong, his vision kept mixing her up with the vulnerable woman he\u2019d taken on a picnic a couple of months ago. A pretty, young woman who\u2019d just been left by her husband, and was crushed by the betrayal. And what fool would give her up? he thought. It was beyond him.</p><p>The rape trial had been one of the toughest of her career. It had taken her months to prepare a case against the suspect for serial rape. The forensic evidence had been strong, but in the end the only witness who hadn\u2019t failed her was a prostitute with a bad record, and the guy walked. Brie had identified him to the police as her rapist when she\u2019d regained consciousness.</p><p>In the early hours of the morning she turned her swollen face toward Mike and opened her eyes\u2014or tried to. One was partially shut because of the swelling. He scooted closer. \u201cBrie,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Brie. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands over her face and cried out. \u201cNo! No!\u201d</p><p>He took gentle hold of her wrists. \u201cBrie! It\u2019s me. It\u2019s Mike. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t pull her hands away from her face. \u201cPlease,\u201d she whimpered pitifully. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to see this....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I saw you already,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been sitting here for hours. Let it go,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She let him slowly pull her hands away from her battered face. \u201cWhy? Why are you here? You shouldn\u2019t be here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack wanted me to help him understand what was happening with the investigation. But I wanted to be here. Brie, I wanted to be here for you.\u201d He brushed her brow gently. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe... He got my gun....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police know, honey. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so dangerous. I tried to get him\u2014that\u2019s why he did this. I was going to put him away for life.\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s jaw pulsed, but he kept his voice soft. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Brie. It\u2019s over now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they find him?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid they pick him up?\u201d</p><p>Oh, how he wished she wouldn\u2019t ask that. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know why he didn\u2019t kill me?\u201d she asked, a tear running out of her swollen eye and down over the bridge of her purple nose. He tenderly wiped it away. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t want me to die. He wanted me to try to get him again, and watch him walk again. He wore a condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, honey...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get him, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease... Don\u2019t think about that now. I\u2019ll get the nurse. Get you another sedative.\u201d He put the light on and the nurse came immediately. \u201cBrie needs something to help her go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d the nurse said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to wake up again,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just going to think the same things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to rest,\u201d he said, leaning over to kiss her brow. \u201cI\u2019ll be right here. And there\u2019s an officer outside your door. You\u2019re completely safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike,\u201d she whispered. She held his hand for a long moment. \u201cDid Jack ask you to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, gently touching her brow. \u201cBut when I found out what happened, I had to come,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI had to.\u201d</p><p>After having a sedative administered into the IV, she gently closed her eyes again. Her hand slipped out of his and he sat back in his chair. Then, his elbows on his knees and his face buried in his hands, he silently wept.</p><p>Jack was back at the hospital before dawn, not looking particularly rested although he had showered and shaved. He had dark circles under eyes that were lit by a very scary inner brightness. Mike had sisters he cherished; he could imagine the rage that burned inside Jack.</p><p>Mike stepped into the hall outside Brie\u2019s door to quietly talk with Jack, explaining the night had been quiet and he thought Brie had rested. While they stood there, the doctor making rounds went into the room, his nurse in tow. Mike used that opportunity to visit the men\u2019s room. He stared in the mirror; he looked far worse than Jack. He needed a shower and shave, but he didn\u2019t want to leave her. Family members would be returning soon, but Mike didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be keeping Brie in the hospital for long.</p><p>On his way back to Brie\u2019s room, he saw Jack talking to a man outside her door. In fact, Jack was right up in his face. The officer providing security was stepping closer to them, making a gesture with his hands that they should separate. Then Mike realized it was Brie\u2019s ex-husband, Brad, and that probably within seconds Jack was going to kill him just on principle.</p><p>Mike made fast tracks. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he said, separating them first with an arm between them, then with his entire body. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he said again. \u201cNone of this. Come on.\u201d</p><p>From over Mike\u2019s shoulder, Jack demanded of Brad, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Brad glared meanly. \u201cNice to see you, too, Jack,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t belong here,\u201d Jack said too loudly. \u201cYou left her. You\u2019re done with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, bristling. \u201cI never stopped caring about Brie. Never will. I\u2019m going to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Jack said. \u201cShe\u2019s in no shape to have to deal with you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in charge of the guest list, Jack. That\u2019s up to Brie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Mike said sternly. \u201cLet\u2019s not do this here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk him if he wants to take it outside,\u201d Jack snapped back.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Mike said yet again, widening the space between the two men. \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening here!\u201d</p><p>Brad moved closer, pushing up against Mike, but lowered his voice cautiously. \u201cI know you\u2019re angry, Jack. In general and at me. I don\u2019t blame you. But if you get tough with me, it\u2019s going to be worse for Brie. And this officer is just going to hook you up.\u201d</p><p>Jack ground his teeth, pushing up against the other side of Mike. Mike was having some trouble holding them apart. \u201cI really want to hit someone,\u201d Jack said through clenched teeth. \u201cRight now, you\u2019d do as well as anyone. You walked out on your marriage. You left her while she was building a case against that son of a bitch. Do you have any idea what you did to her?\u201d</p><p>Oh, boy, Mike thought. It was going to happen between these two any second, right in the hospital hallway. Mike was a good six feet and pretty strong, but Brad and Jack were both taller, broader, angrier and not a shoulder injury between them. Mike was going to get hammered when they lost it and started pummeling each other.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Brad said. \u201cYeah, I do! And I want her to know that I still care about what happens to her. We\u2019re divorced, but we have history. A lot of it good history. If I can do anything now...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d Mike said to the cop. \u201cHey! Come on!\u201d</p><p>The police officer finally got in it, putting himself between Brad and Jack along with Mike. \u201cAll right, gentlemen,\u201d the cop said. \u201cI have my orders. No scuffling outside Ms. Sheridan\u2019s door. If you want to talk this over calmly, I\u2019d like you to move down the hall.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that was not a good suggestion, Mike thought. If they moved down the hall, they wouldn\u2019t be talking. Mike cautiously backed Jack up a few steps. \u201cTake a breath,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Jack glowered at Mike. \u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off,\u201d Mike said with as much authority as he could muster.</p><p>Just then a nurse came out of Brie\u2019s room and Brad snagged her too fast for Jack to intervene. \u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m Ms. Sheridan\u2019s ex-husband. Brad. I\u2019m also a police detective,\u201d he said, badging her. \u201cOff duty. Will you ask her if she\u2019ll see me? Please?\u201d</p><p>The nurse made a U-turn and went back into the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here?\u201d Brad asked, indicating Mike with his eyes and a jut of his chin.</p> <p>Oh, mistake, Mike thought instantly, stiffening. Was Brad crazy? Pissing off the guy who was keeping Jack from killing him? He felt his own fists begin to open and close. The ex wants to know why another man is here? He dumps his wife for another woman, but no guy is supposed to pick up where he left off? Mike actually smiled, though coldly. Balls, he thought. I should just let Jack beat him up.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a cop,\u201d Jack said, stretching the truth somewhat. \u201cI asked him to come. To help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can go,\u201d Brad said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need his help.\u201d</p><p>That did it. Mike took one fast step in Brad\u2019s direction, but was stopped by a strong hand on the bad shoulder, pulling him back. That was all it took to get his attention; he wasn\u2019t going to put Brie through this. But if they all ran into each other somewhere else, like the parking lot, he couldn\u2019t make any promises. Right now he wanted a piece of Brad as much as Jack did.</p><p>The nurse returned from the room and spoke to Brad. \u201cWhen the doctor is finished, you can go in.\u201d</p><p>Brad had the good sense not to take on any superior airs. He didn\u2019t avoid eye contact with the other men, however.</p> <p>\u201cLet me ask you one question,\u201d Jack said to Brad, trying to keep his voice under control to avoid being ejected by the uniform. \u201cWere you at work the night it happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jack ground his teeth. \u201cThen if you hadn\u2019t walked out on her for another woman, you\u2019d have been at the house that night. Maybe waiting up for her to get home. Maybe right inside where you could hear her scream. So much for your good history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Brad began, clearly wishing to argue the point. But Jack turned away from him and took several steps down the hall. Right then the doctor came breezing out of the room, looking down at the chart as he walked by all three men. Brad lifted his chin, glared briefly and entered Brie\u2019s room.</p><p>Mike let out his breath. \u201cThat was gonna be so ugly,\u201d he said. He went to the chair outside Brie\u2019s door and sat. Jack paced, fidgeting. He took several steps down the hall, away from the door.</p><p>Mike rested his elbows on his knees. He scratched his itchy beard. He noticed the cop was standing beside him.</p><p>\u201cThis has got to be tough,\u201d the cop said to Mike, indicating Jack just a few feet away, his jaw pulsing and his hands in fists at his sides.</p><p>Mike turned his head, looked up at the young officer. He glanced at his best friend; Jack was tortured, helpless. \u201cNothing can prepare you for something like this to happen to a woman you love,\u201d he said softly. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p> <p>Brie was released from the hospital that afternoon and she went home to her father\u2019s house. Sam and Jack drove her while Mike followed in his own car, watching with concern. He hadn\u2019t been around very many sexual assault victims in his police career, but certainly he\u2019d come into contact with some. He had never seen a woman so stoic, so removed. Once they all arrived at Sam\u2019s, she went directly to the room that had been hers when she was younger. She called Jack to come, to cover the mirror.</p><p>Brie took her dinner on a tray in her room that night. Her sisters stopped by one at a time, visited with her in her room, but didn\u2019t stay long. There were five Sheridan siblings, all married but Brie. Two of the sisters were older than Jack, one was a couple of years younger and then there was Brie, the caboose, eleven years younger than Jack. Her three older sisters had brought to the family eight daughters, and Jack and Mel had provided the only boy in little David. So when the family was all together, it was an almost unmanageable crowd. A teeming throng filled with noise and laughter\u2014Mike had seen that for himself on earlier visits. It was not unlike the Valenzuela household. Not so now. The house was still, like a mausoleum.</p><p>Mike had a quiet dinner with Sam, Jack and Mel.</p><p>\u201cYou should probably head for L.A.,\u201d Jack said to Mike when the table was cleared.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI can stay a day or so, see if anything develops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hold you up,\u201d Jack said. Then he walked out onto the patio and Mike followed. \u201cI can call you if anything happens.\u201d</p><p>Sam came outside holding a tray with three glasses. There was a short shot of amber liquid in each and he put the tray on the patio table. Without conversation, the men each took one, sipping in silence. The June air was sultry in the Sacramento valley, humid and almost oppressive. After a few minutes Sam got up and said good-night. Then Jack finished his drink and went into the house. One by one, the lights inside began to go out, leaving only the kitchen light for Mike. Exhausted as he was, he didn\u2019t feel like sleep. He helped himself to another short shot and went back to the patio, lighting the candle on the table.</p><p>The whole family is in shock, he thought. They move around silently; they grieve Brie\u2019s lost innocence. Everyone under this roof is in terrible pain; they feel each physical blow for which she bears the marks.</p><p>\u201cYou should probably go now.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and saw Brie standing in the open patio doors, wearing the same clothes she had worn home from the hospital. \u201cBrie,\u201d he said, rising.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve talked to the detectives several times. Jerome Powell, the rapist, was tracked as far as New Mexico, then the trail was lost,\u201d she said, very businesslike. \u201cI can tell you from experience, the odds are at least ninety-five percent he\u2019s gone\u2014pulled a territorial. I\u2019m going to start counseling and group therapy right away\u2014and I\u2019ve decided not to go back to work for a while. Jack and Mel insist on staying the rest of the week, but you should go. Visit your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come and sit with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to the D.A. every day, see if he turns up anything new. Of course I\u2019m staying here. If I need any assistance in the police department, I have an ex-husband who\u2019s feeling very guilty. And very helpful.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cI wanted to say goodbye. And to thank you for trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie,\u201d he said, taking a step toward her, his arms open.</p><p>She held up a hand, and the look that came into her eyes stopped him where he was. She shook her head, kept her hand raised against him. \u201cYou understand,\u201d she said, warning him not to get too close, not to touch her.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDrive carefully,\u201d she said, disappearing into the house.</p><p>Two</p><p>One week later Mel and Jack returned to Virgin River to resume their routine. Mel went into Doc\u2019s every morning, the baby with her for the day. If something urgent came up, she could always take the baby over to Jack at the bar, or if Jack wasn\u2019t there, Paige or Preacher or Mike were more than willing to babysit. For the most part, David could be counted on to remain content for the half hour or so Mel needed to see a patient as long as she had the bouncy seat with her and he was neither hungry nor dirty. He still took two long naps a day\u2014one in the morning and one in the afternoon.</p><p>Mel had been back from Sacramento less than two weeks when a teenage girl from Virgin River came to Doc\u2019s and asked to see her. Carra Jean Winslow was fifteen and Mel had never seen her before. In fact, even though Mel had lived and worked in Virgin River for just over a year, she didn\u2019t know the girl\u2019s parents. Taking note of her age and obvious anxiety, Mel took her to an examining room before asking her what she needed. When a fifteen-year-old girl who didn\u2019t cough or wheeze or bring her parents came in to see the nurse midwife, the possibilities seemed pretty limited and obvious.</p><p>\u201cI heard there was a pill that could keep you from getting pregnant if, you know, you had sex,\u201d she said. She said it very quietly, looking at her feet.</p><p>\u201cEmergency birth control. But it\u2019s only effective if the intercourse has been very recent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo nights ago,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s recent enough,\u201d Mel said, trying to put her at ease with a smile. \u201cAny problems? Pain? Bleeding? Anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBleeding. There was some bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst time?\u201d Mel asked, smiling kindly. The girl nodded. \u201cHave you ever had an internal exam before?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and looked down again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to check you, make sure everything is okay. It\u2019s not as terrible as you think,\u201d Mel said, touching her arm gently. \u201cHow much bleeding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too much. A little... Getting better...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel? There?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and said, \u201cStill a little sore. Not bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. I assume, if you\u2019re interested in emergency contraception, you didn\u2019t use a condom....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carra answered.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we can handle this. Can I get you to undress and put on a gown for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom... No one knows I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, Carra. This is between you and me. I\u2019m only interested in your health. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes. Everything off, just the gown.\u201d</p><p>Poor thing, Mel thought. She ached for young girls who had just stumbled into this sort of thing without planning, without being sure. And that described almost all young girls. But at least she was here, avoiding yet another disaster. She gave Carra plenty of time to get undressed, but didn\u2019t leave her waiting long enough to tangle up her nerves, then returned to the exam room.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a blood pressure and listen to your heart first,\u201d she said briskly.</p><p>\u201cI have to pay you myself,\u201d Carra said. \u201cI don\u2019t want my parents to know about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarra, confidentiality is important in this office\u2014you can trust that,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is all going to work out.\u201d She applied the blood pressure cuff, noting there were a few small bruises on the girl\u2019s upper arm. \u201cYou have a couple of bruises here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It was...volleyball. It can get a little rough sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like someone grabbed you,\u201d Mel suggested.</p><p>The girl shrugged. \u201cIt happens.\u201d</p><p>Mel got the blood pressure, which was normal. She listened to Carra\u2019s heart, looked in her eyes, checked her pupils. Except for the nervous pounding of her heart, she seemed to be in good shape. She showed her the speculum, explained the procedure and eased her carefully into position for the pelvic. \u201cNice and slow, feet right here, slide down for me. That\u2019s it. Try to relax, your knees apart, honey. Thank you. This isn\u2019t going to be bad at all, so take some deep breaths and try to relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, and began to softly cry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo crying now,\u201d Mel said gently. \u201cEverything is going to be all right, because you came to see me right away.\u201d She gently parted the girl\u2019s knees and was frozen. Her labia were bruised and swollen; there were bruises on the insides of her thighs that bore a striking resemblance to the bruises on the girl\u2019s upper arm. An unmistakable thumbprint and fingers. Oh, God damn. Mel stood from her stool and looked over the drape at Carra\u2019s face. \u201cCarra, I can see that you\u2019re very sore. Bruised and swollen and a little torn. I\u2019d like to proceed, take a closer look to be sure everything is all right. But only if you\u2019re up to it. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She pinched her eyes closed, but nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be as gentle as I can,\u201d Mel said. She put on her gloves but set the speculum aside. \u201cI\u2019m just going to check your vagina and uterus, Carra\u2014I\u2019m not going to use the speculum because you\u2019re sore. I\u2019d like you to take a deep breath for me, then let it out slowly. That\u2019s it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll just take a minute. Don\u2019t clench. Relax your muscles, Carra. There you go, very good. Tell me, does this pressure hurt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot so much,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Why do these things always come in batches? Mel thought. I\u2019m not over Brie! Carra\u2019s vaginal wall was torn, ragged. Raw. Her hymen was ripped open and looked like so many little fingers. She completed her exam quickly, and while she didn\u2019t have a rape kit handy, she did have a sterile swab with which she took a vaginal specimen, although it could be too late for any DNA recovery.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Carra, let me help you sit up.\u201d Mel snapped off her gloves and helped Carra get herself settled, legs dangling off the table. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about what happened to you, Carra. It looks like you\u2019ve been hurt. Want to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and a couple of big tears spilled over. Carra was a plain girl with an oblong face, bushy, unshaped brows and a small problem with acne. And right now, a really bad case of regret and fear and nerves.</p><p>\u201cIt will be confidential,\u201d Mel said tenderly. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the bruises, Carra. Your vagina looks ragged. Torn. The damage isn\u2019t serious. It\u2019ll heal. But from everything I can see\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was me. It was my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like this is never a woman\u2019s fault,\u201d she said, and she used woman purposely, although this was a mere girl. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what happened, and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll give me that pill?\u201d she asked desperately.</p><p>\u201cOf course. We\u2019re not going to let you get pregnant. Or sick.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath, but it brought the tears harder. \u201cI just changed my mind when it was too late, that\u2019s all. So it\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>Mel touched her knee. \u201cGo back to the beginning. Nice and easy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSure you can, honey. I\u2019ll just listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe decided we were going to do it. He got all excited about that\u2014he said he was sorry after. We\u2019d already started.... He couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could,\u201d she said. \u201cI can see the bruises from his fingers, like he held you down, held your legs apart. I can see the marks, the tears. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Carra. Until you didn\u2019t. And you told him no, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you said no at all, that\u2019s rape, Carra. Date rape.\u201d</p> <p>Carra leaned forward, her position pleading. \u201cBut I\u2019ve done things with him. Lots of things. And I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had intercourse before?\u201d She shook her head. No. \u201cYou can say no right up to the last minute, Carra. That\u2019s the law. And it doesn\u2019t matter what you did with him before. Tell me\u2014is this a boyfriend? Or someone you\u2019ve only known a little while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known him a long time from school, but he\u2019s been my boyfriend a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>But they\u2019ve done a lot? Mel was asking herself. \u201cCarra, he moved pretty fast. I want you to think about this. A couple of weeks. This is one determined guy. How old is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not telling you any more. I\u2019m not getting him in trouble. It wasn\u2019t his fault. It was my mistake, but he\u2019s sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, listen\u2014don\u2019t get yourself all upset. If you change your mind and want to talk about this, you just call me. Or come to see me. Doesn\u2019t matter when. Let\u2019s get you on a dependable birth control and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not doing it again,\u201d she said, holding her mouth in a tight line while tears wet her cheeks.</p><p>Oh, she\u2019d been raped. Sounded as if she didn\u2019t even have much of a date, Mel thought. \u201cCarra, if you continue to see this boy, this man, it\u2019s going to happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it again,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI need that emergency pill. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all for right now,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI want you to come back in a week or two, so we can test for STDs and be sure you\u2019re healing up. It\u2019s too soon for anything to turn up today, this soon after exposure. But this is really important. Will you do that?\u201d</p><p>In the end she agreed, but she wouldn\u2019t accept birth control. In a very businesslike tone she asked Mel, \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it, Carra. This one\u2019s on the house. Call me if you need me. Anytime. I mean it\u2014anytime. Night or day. I\u2019ll write down the number here and my number at home for you. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said meekly.</p><p>After all that, the thing that really tore at Mel\u2019s heart was seeing her patient ride away on her bicycle. The girl wasn\u2019t even old enough to drive a car. And she pedaled while standing up\u2014her tender bottom couldn\u2019t handle the seat.</p><p>Mike Valenzuela called Brie. He couldn\u2019t help himself. It had been two weeks since he\u2019d heard her voice. Jack was more than happy to keep him up-to-date on her recovery, how she sounded, but Mike needed more. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cPretty rugged. Kind of edgy and nervous,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut then, it hasn\u2019t been that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysically?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>\u201cI... Ah... I guess the worst is over. The bruises are beginning to fade. But it\u2019s amazing how long it takes a couple of ribs to heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack says you took an extended leave of absence from the prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you why?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. And you don\u2019t have to tell me. Don\u2019t make yourself uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t work like that\u2014when I can prosecute a suspect for rape and he gets off.\u201d She laughed bitterly. \u201cOn me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Brie,\u201d he said, sympathetic. \u201cGod, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I get a chance, if they find him, I\u2019m going to bury him. I\u2019ll put him away for life. I swear to God.\u201d</p><p>Mike took a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the bravest women I\u2019ve ever known. I\u2019m proud of you. If there\u2019s anything I can do...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice of you to call,\u201d she said more softly. \u201cNot many people besides family are brave enough\u2014I guess they\u2019re afraid of what they might hear. Does Jack know you called?\u201d</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be long before Jack found out, Mike thought. Sam had answered the phone, asked who was calling before putting her on. \u201cI didn\u2019t call you because you\u2019re Jack\u2019s sister, but because you\u2019re my friend and I wanted to know how you are. I don\u2019t really care if Jack\u2019s okay with it, only if you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with it. His protective nature usually just amuses me. Or annoys me. But not at the moment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels kind of like a shield, just knowing how he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be protective if you were my sister, too,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling protective myself, though there\u2019s not much I can do but call and talk. I think this is what happens to everyone around the crime, Brie. We all have our responses\u2014from the victim to her friends and family. It\u2019s all part of the healing process. I watched my friends and family go through that, too. It\u2019s one of the reasons I came up here\u2014it was becoming oppressive. Their need for me to heal so they could feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep forgetting that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how self-absorbed I\u2019ve become. You\u2019re a crime victim, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be self-absorbed right now. Self-protective. Focused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how you were?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cOhhhh.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI wish you could\u2019ve seen my routine. I started out the day by crawling out of bed crippled, the pain terrible. I dosed up on the anti-inflammatory, iced down my shoulder and groin, drank Mel\u2019s protein supplement drinks that would gag a maggot, and then started my exercises with one-pound weights\u2014so light, so nothing. And it would make me almost cry. Then I\u2019d have to lie down. It took me two months to do a sit-up\u2014and Mel would help me with the physical therapy on my shoulder every day, but not until afternoon, not until I could drink a beer first to take the edge off. She\u2019s little, you know, but you shouldn\u2019t let that fool you\u2014she can pull and push and grind on an injured muscle until you beg like a baby. My life was all about getting my body back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish this was just about my body,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cThere were also nightmares,\u201d he said quietly, almost reluctantly. \u201cI\u2019d like you to know\u2014I\u2019m not having them anymore.\u201d And he thought, you just don\u2019t realize yet how much of this is going to end up being about your body. He had at least a passing knowledge of what rape and assault victims went through. It was going to be a long time before Brie would have a healthy sexual relationship.</p><p>Afterward, Mike was pretty astonished that Jack made no mention of his call to Brie. It could mean only one thing\u2014neither Brie nor Sam had mentioned it, and he wasn\u2019t sure why. He gave brief consideration to bringing it to Jack\u2019s attention himself. He could explain his concern easily\u2014he had a few things in common with her at the moment and might be able to offer support. But in the end, he said nothing. He didn\u2019t feel like an odd three-way, checking in with Jack about his feelings for Brie. Nothing had changed in the way he felt toward her, except that at the moment they were both crippled.</p><p>The middle of July was steamy and wet, and Mike called her every couple of days, and still Jack said nothing. It seemed to Mike that she took his calls as if looking forward to them a little bit. They rarely talked about the crime and her recovery, but about mundane things. His fishing, what she was reading or watching on TV, weather, Sam and her sisters and nieces, letters that Ricky\u2014a kid from town who had been Jack\u2019s and Preacher\u2019s young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and helper in the bar\u2014was writing home from USMC basic training.</p><p>She told him about her new phobias\u2014the dark, public places, noises in the night that she\u2019d probably never even heard before. She put her house on the market\u2014she had no intention of living there alone again. She thought she might eventually be strong enough to live on her own, but not there, where it happened.</p><p>\u201cAre you getting out at all?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cCounseling, group sessions. The occasional trip to the store with Dad,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to leave the house. I\u2019ll have to find a way to change that soon, but for now, I just want to feel safe. That\u2019s a tall enough order.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He could hear the growing strength in Brie\u2019s voice despite her new fears; she laughed regularly, and the sound of her voice brought him great peace of mind. He teased her, told her jokes, even played his guitar for her over the phone so she could tell him he was improving.</p><p>Jack, however, was too quiet. Mike confronted him, asked him how he was doing. \u201cI just want her back, man,\u201d Jack said somberly. \u201cBrie\u2014she was always such a goddamn life force.\u201d</p><p>Mike gripped Jack on the upper arm. \u201cShe\u2019ll be back. She\u2019s got the stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I hope you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right,\u201d Mike said. \u201cYou need me for anything tomorrow? I\u2019m thinking of driving down the coast, having a look around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, enjoy yourself,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Ordinarily, Mike wouldn\u2019t have given even a second thought to going to Sacramento without mentioning it to Jack, but these circumstances were different, and he wasn\u2019t an idiot\u2014Jack would want to know. Still, he said nothing and in fact had covered his tracks, acting as though he was out for a day of poking around. He rose before Jack began splitting logs behind the bar in the early morning\u2014his ritual even in summer, when there was no need to lay a fire. He hit the road south through Ukiah in the predawn hours, arriving in the city by ten in the morning.</p><p>After he rang the doorbell, he saw a shadow cross the peephole, then the locks slid and the door opened. \u201cMike?\u201d Sam asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI decided not to call ahead, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>Brie appeared from around the corner, standing behind her dad. \u201cMike?\u201d she asked in equal surprise.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou look good,\u201d he said, relieved. \u201cGreat. You look great. I was saying I didn\u2019t call ahead because I thought if I just came here, maybe I could lure you out of the house for a while. If I\u2019d called, you\u2019d think of a million excuses.\u201d</p><p>She actually took a step back. \u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Folsom,\u201d he said. \u201cEnjoy the mountains, walk around the shops, have a little lunch, maybe stop at a vineyard or two. Just a few hours, just for some fresh air and maybe a little practice at facing the public. You have to get out in the world eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not this soon...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only soon because you haven\u2019t done it. You\u2019ll be safe, Brie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie,\u201d Sam said. \u201cYou should take advantage of this. Mike is a trained observer, a cop with years of experience. You couldn\u2019t be in better hands.\u201d</p><p>Mike gave his head a slight bow in Sam\u2019s direction, respectfully. \u201cThank you, sir. You\u2019re welcome to join us.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll pass. But this is a good idea. Brie,\u201d he said, taking her hand and rubbing it between his, as if warming it, \u201cyou should go out for at least an hour, maybe two. Mike\u2019s come all this way....\u201d</p><p>She looked at him pointedly. There might have been a glare in her eye. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell Jack you were doing this, did you.\u201d It was not a question.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. He would have tried to talk me out of it. If you needed someone to pry you out of the house, he\u2019d want to be the one to do it.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI couldn\u2019t risk that.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to think about this momentarily. Finally she said, \u201cI\u2019d better change.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah, you\u2019re fine. Folsom isn\u2019t any fancier than your shorts. Let\u2019s just do it. You won\u2019t be out longer than you\u2019re comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a good idea, Brie. Go out for a while. Have lunch, a glass of wine. I\u2019ll be right here when you get home.\u201d</p><p>Mike got her into the car and started to drive. Brie was predictably quiet, which was what he expected. \u201cYou might be stressed for a little while, but I think it\u2019ll ease up,\u201d he said. Another few minutes of quiet reigned in the car. \u201cWe internalize when we\u2019ve had a trauma. Grow very quiet, very private with feelings.\u201d Again, no conversation. She looked straight ahead, tensely, holding the shoulder strap with one hand, her other crossed protectively over her belly.</p><p>\u201cI was the fourth of eight children and had three older brothers,\u201d Mike said as they began to drive into the foothills of the Sierras. \u201cBy the time I went to kindergarten, I had three younger sisters as well, so my mother, she was very busy. A lot of old-world traditions and values in my house\u2014my father had trouble keeping us all fed, yet he still thought he had the world by the balls with all those sons, and I\u2019m sure he wanted more. But it was a loud and crazy house, and when I went to school for the first time, my English wasn\u2019t so good\u2014we spoke only Spanish and some very bad English in my home, in my neighborhood. And although my father is successful now, at that time we were considered poor.\u201d He glanced over at her briefly. \u201cI got beaten up by some bigger kids my first week in school. I had bruises on my face and other places, but I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone what had happened.\u201d He concentrated on the road. \u201cNot even my brothers, who offered to add to the bruises if I didn\u2019t tell them who had done it and why. I didn\u2019t talk at all for a couple of months.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head toward him, looking at him. He met her eyes. \u201cFrom working with kids who were victims of abuse, I learned that\u2019s not unusual. To go silent like that. I also learned it\u2019s all right to get your bearings before you start talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you talk?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He chuckled to himself. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I remember this correctly, but I think my mother sat me at the kitchen table, alone, and said, \u2018We have to talk about what\u2019s happened to you, Miguel. I can\u2019t let you go back to that school until I know.\u2019 Something like that. It was the not being allowed to go back, even though I was afraid of getting beaten up again, that made me more ashamed of those boys thinking I was a coward. Empty-headed machismo even then.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cDid your mother tell the authorities?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cShe told my brothers. She said, \u2018If he comes home with one bruise, I will beat you and then your father will beat you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s pretty horrible,\u201d Brie said.</p><p>\u201cOld World. Tradition.\u201d He grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Brie. There were a lot more threats than there were beatings. I don\u2019t remember beatings. My father whipped us across the bottom with his belt, but never injured anyone. For my mother, it was the wooden spoon. Not your pansy gringo wooden spoon, but a spoon as long as her arm. Christ, if the belt was unbuckled or the spoon plucked off the shelf, we ran like holy hell. The next generation of Valenzuelas has given up that form of child raising. By the way, it\u2019s not Mexican by genesis\u2014it\u2019s that generation. It was not against the law to beat your child if he misbehaved.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment. Then she asked, \u201cDid you marry Hispanic women?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her curiously. \u201cI did,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth times. Well, mixed Mexican.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drawn to that culture.... Very strongly drawn...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the traditions of my family, but I don\u2019t think that had anything to do with the marriages. I dated a lot of women who weren\u2019t Hispanic. My marriages were brief failures of my youth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the first time I was too young, and so was she. I was in the Marines, and she worked for my father. I wrote to her, married her while home on leave, returned after my tour of duty to find she was interested in another young man. I could have been outraged, but the truth is\u2014I wasn\u2019t faithful either. I was married and divorced by the time I was twenty-one. My mother was completely ashamed of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the second wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a few years later. An employee at LAPD. A dispatcher.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cTime-honored tradition\u2014cops and dispatchers. It lasted six months. My mother has completely lost hope in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you didn\u2019t cling to all the traditions....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I miss about my family\u2019s traditions? My mother\u2019s cooking, my father\u2019s skills and ingenuity. My mother and father did most of their cooking for large tribes on the patio\u2014on the grill and in huge pots over slow burners. Mole, the old family recipe, tamales wrapped in banana leaves, enchiladas, carne asada. My mother\u2019s salsa and guacamole would make you pass out, it\u2019s so good. She makes a fish with sliced olives that\u2019s amazing. Her shrimp in tomatoes, avocado and Tapat\u00edo is astonishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTapat\u00edo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot sauce. Pretty hot hot sauce. And my father could do anything\u2014he built a room on our house, a gazebo in the yard, poured concrete, put a wall around the yard, rewired the house, built a freestanding garage\u2014and I\u2019m sure he did all that without building permits, but I had the sense never to ask. And the landscaping was incredible. That was his business, landscaping. He started out trimming hedges and mowing lawns, but later he started his own little business. It\u2019s now a pretty good sized business with a lot of corporate clients. He has a million relatives and sons\u2014he never runs out of employees. My father was an immigrant, but he didn\u2019t have to naturalize. My mother is a first-generation American, born in Los Angeles\u2014marriage to her validated him. But interestingly, she is the one to uphold the old traditions in our family. He wanted to acclimate himself to the U.S. quickly, so he could get about the business of making that fortune poor, hungry Mexican boys dream about. And he did, though he worked damn hard to do it.\u201d He pulled into the town of Folsom, found a place to park and went around to Brie\u2019s side to open her door.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your growing up,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot nearly as interesting as yours,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLet me be the judge,\u201d he said, taking her elbow and walking her across the street toward a gift shop.</p><p>As he maneuvered her through shops, galleries, antique stores and bakeries, she told him about life with three much older sisters who babied her, and Jack who fussed over her till she was about six, then again when he was home on leave. Her household didn\u2019t sound terribly different from his, except that her mother didn\u2019t cook outside, use oversize cooking pots and implements, and her father was a whiz at numbers and investing, not building or landscaping. Otherwise, their childhoods were similar\u2014large families filled with noise and laughter, loyalty and blistering sibling fights. \u201cThe girls fought like animals,\u201d she said. \u201cThey never fought with me\u2014I was the baby. And Jack was threatened with certain death if he ever struck a girl, so they went after him with a vengeance, knowing he was helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny chance there\u2019s a video of that somewhere?\u201d he asked, laughing.</p><p>\u201cIf there was, Jack would have it destroyed by now. They were terrible to him. It\u2019s amazing he loves them now. Of course, he had his revenge in small ways. He played tricks on them constantly\u2014but to his credit, he never fought them physically. Fought back, I should say. Until he returned from his first hitch in the Marines, I believe he wished them dead.\u201d</p><p>Mike stopped walking outside a corner pub and looked at his watch. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re getting hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Mexican place down the street,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNah, there\u2019s not a Mexican restaurant in the world that can satisfy me now. I\u2019m a mama\u2019s boy. How about a hamburger?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSure. This has been easier than I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking it nice and slow and you\u2019ve been distracted by conversation,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds so professional,\u201d she commented, entering the pub. \u201cAnd here I thought you were having fun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughed at her. \u201cSurely you can tell I\u2019m completely miserable,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course I\u2019m having fun. But I\u2019m here on a mission\u2014getting you out. If I happen to have a good time while I\u2019m doing it, even better.\u201d</p><p>He directed her to a corner booth, moved her into the seat from which she could see the whole restaurant so she wouldn\u2019t feel vulnerable, and told her to order a beer or glass of wine. There were only a few people in the pub, so she could easily see everyone having lunch. Then they ordered hamburgers and continued the discussion into the teenage years\u2014their grades, dates, trouble they\u2019d been in. Here they were opposites\u2014Brie was an exceptional student, had a couple of very polite boyfriends, never any trouble. Mike couldn\u2019t concentrate until he was over twenty, dated anyone who would have him, got into plenty of trouble\u2014even trouble with the police, who brought him home late at night more than once, waking his parents. By the time they were halfway through their hamburgers, there was a slight disturbance in the pub. A man shouted at the waiter, \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable!\u201d</p><p>Brie\u2019s eyes grew round and Mike looked over his shoulder. There were two couples across the room at a table; they looked to be middle-aged married couples. One of the men was irate, while the other tried to mollify him, placing a hand over his forearm and speaking quietly. Both women drew back, if not just embarrassed, then concerned. The waiter leaned down and said something to the angry man, and he reacted. He picked up his glass of beer and hurled it toward the bar, smashing the glass, beer splattering and shards of glass flying. If the pub had been more crowded, it could have been dangerous. \u201cNot good enough!\u201d he shouted.</p> <p>Brie gasped and stiffened, terror in her eyes. Mike glanced at her, glanced over his shoulder again, back at Brie. Panic was showing on her face.</p><p>Then the owner or manager came rushing into the room and to the table, speaking quietly first to the waiter, then to the disgruntled customer. The angry diner talked back, though his words were impossible to make out. The other man at the table clearly tried to quiet him, but he stood abruptly and shoved the manager, causing him to take a few steps backward.</p><p>Mike looked at a terrified Brie and thought, this is all she needs. Bullshit like this her first time out in the real public. He put a hand over hers. \u201cStay right here and breathe deeply.\u201d Then he got up and strode purposefully toward the table. Already kitchen staff were peeking out the window in the swinging door to the kitchen.</p><p>Mike placed himself between the waiter and manager, directly in front of the offender, and was grateful that he was taller than all of them, younger and more fit than the pissed-off man. He looked into the manager\u2019s eyes and said calmly, \u201cCall the police, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir. I believe we can handle the situation now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen if you\u2019ll allow me the use of your phone, I\u2019ll place the call.\u201d</p><p>The angry customer tried to shove Mike out of the way and said, \u201cI\u2019m getting the hell out of this shit hole.\u201d</p><p>Mike simply straightened, grabbed the wrist of the man\u2019s hand to ward off his shove, blocked his passage and raised the palm of his other hand. He used an authoritative voice to say, \u201cPlease sit down, sir. I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve paid for your meal and drinks.\u201d He was firm but polite. Though Mike was only a couple of inches taller, he was younger and the expression on his face very determined. The man sat. Then Mike looked at the manager and said, \u201cThe police, if you please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d said the friend, standing, opening his wallet. \u201cLet me just pay for it and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but your angry friend is going to settle up with the police now. Throwing glassware, assaulting the management is against the law.\u201d Then he looked over his shoulder, lifted his eyebrows to the manager and gave a nod.</p><p>\u201cCall the police,\u201d the manager instructed the waiter, and the young man fled.</p> <p>Twenty minutes later the local police took the angry client away, still sputtering about his terrible meal. It turned out that his dissatisfaction with his lunch had been met with an offer of a replacement meal or discount from the waiter, but the man had wanted his entire foursome comped, despite protests from his wife and the other couple. It also turned out he was a little drunk and unmanageable. Handcuffs were not necessary, but the police decided it would be best if these visitors were escorted out of town and everyone exited calmly. The little pub returned to its quiet atmosphere.</p><p>The manager brought Mike a beer and Brie the wine she\u2019d had with lunch. \u201cWith our compliments,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cThank you very much,\u201d Mike said. Then, turning to Brie, he placed a hand softly over hers and said, \u201cGod, I\u2019m so sorry that happened, Brie. I hope you\u2019re not too upset.\u201d</p><p>Brie\u2019s eyes were actually twinkling. She smiled. \u201cTalk about baptism by fire,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOf all the days for that clown to get tanked and cause trouble\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Brie answered him with a laugh. \u201cGod. For a minute I had all kinds of hysterical fears\u2014and then it was over. The police were called, he was escorted away and it was over. Plus,\u201d she said, lifting her glass, \u201cfree drinks.\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s brows drew together, concern that she\u2019d become hysterical. \u201cI\u2019ll cover the drinks in the tip. I guess you\u2019re not hopelessly traumatized?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cI\u2019m reminded. I\u2019ve been up against some scary individuals, but ninety-nine percent of the time, they\u2019re all bluster. They threaten, make a lot of noise, show off and then when they\u2019re picked up by police, they cry.\u201d She leaned across the table. Her voice sank to a whisper. \u201cI\u2019ve been reciting a mantra to myself for weeks\u2014it\u2019s been over ten years since an officer of the court was actually hurt by a defendant, and that ADA was not seriously injured. I\u2019m not fixed, but I\u2019m reminded\u2014what happened to me was very unusual. What happened today was more typical.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou deal a lot in percentages, I guess,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNinety-three point five percent of the time,\u201d she answered with a smile.</p><p>Every week, like clockwork, Jack received a letter from Ricky, the boy who\u2019d been his shadow for a few wonderful years until joining the Marines immediately following his high school graduation. The letter was always addressed to Jack, opened with \u201cDear Jack, Preach, Mike and everyone.\u201d It was the best part of his week.</p><p>When Jack first came to Virgin River, he bought the cabin because of its size and location, right in the middle of town. It had spacious rooms. He slept in one room while he worked on the other, then shifted his pallet. He was building the bar, not quite knowing if it would work in a town of only six hundred. He added the room upstairs and the apartment behind the kitchen, where he lived until Mel came into his life.</p><p>Ricky was a kid from down the street, a gregarious, freckle-faced youngster with a bright smile and the disposition of a friendly puppy. When Jack found out it was just Rick and his elderly grandma, he pulled him in, acting as something of a surrogate older brother or father. He had the privilege of a few years with the boy, watching him grow into a fine young man\u2014strong, decent, brave. Jack taught him to fly-fish, to shoot and hunt. Together they\u2019d gone through some fun times, some heartbreaking times. The day Rick left for the Marine Corps at the tender age of eighteen had been a day of both admiration and grief for Jack. There was a part of him that swelled in pride that Ricky would take on the Corps, and another part that worried, for no one knew better than Jack how challenging, how dangerous it could be.</p><p>When the letters came, he would share them with Preacher and Mike, then walk down to Lydie\u2019s house\u2014Rick\u2019s grandmother. They would exchange news, for Rick wrote at least two letters a week during basic training\u2014one to the bar where he had worked since he was fourteen, and one to his grandma. Lydie\u2019s news was always censored, Rick keeping the rougher and tougher parts of his experience from her. But Jack read his letter aloud and Lydie laughed and gasped and shuddered, but loved hearing the unabridged version.</p><p>People started showing up at the bar when they heard there\u2019d been a letter. Connie and Ron, the aunt and uncle of Ricky\u2019s teenage girlfriend, always came around, hungry for news. Doc Mullins was as anxious as anyone, as were Mel and Paige. The Carpenters, Bristols, Hope McCrea... Everyone missed Ricky.</p><p>\u201cThey run us through the rain and mud with a thirty-pound ruck on our backs for miles and miles and miles, screaming and yelling about how we have to pay our dues, get tough\u2014and it makes me want to laugh,\u201d Rick wrote. \u201cI keep thinking, brother, this is nothing. I paid my dues in Virgin River....\u201d</p><p>Ricky and his young girlfriend, Liz, had had a baby together six months ago. A baby who hadn\u2019t lived. They were too young, too fragile to be having a baby in the first place; too young and tender for such a tragedy. Being a father himself, Jack had no trouble imagining how the rigors of the Corps could seem like child\u2019s play by comparison.</p><p>Jack missed the boy. Missed him as a father misses a son.</p><p>Mike stepped up his phone calls to Brie to almost every day and it reminded him of how he\u2019d fallen in love when he was a boy. So much phone time. So many hours given to idle conversation about the day, the activities, the family. They\u2019d occasionally drift into tenuous territory\u2014religion and politics. At one point Mike asked her if she was driving yet and she said, a little bit. Over to her sisters\u2019 houses, once in a while to the store, really quickly. \u201cHow are you doing in the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem driving. It\u2019s when I get where I\u2019m going that I feel vulnerable. Unsafe. I have a new gun,\u201d she informed him. \u201cTo replace the one I lost.\u201d</p><p>He was silent a minute. \u201cUh, Brie... I wouldn\u2019t want your confidence in the car to come from the fact that you plan to shoot the first Good Samaritan who pulls over to help you change a flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t exactly what I meant. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I don\u2019t want to know any more.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. Her laugh seemed to come a little more easily these days, at least with him. \u201cIt makes me feel safer, even though it didn\u2019t do me any good before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering\u2014do you want to have lunch again? Meet me this time? Provided you don\u2019t have far to go and agree to leave the gun at home...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Santa Rosa,\u201d he suggested. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to come to Sacramento, but it might be good, you driving somewhere that\u2019s not just around the corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long way to go for lunch,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cPractice,\u201d he said. \u201cExpand your boundaries. Get out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s in it for you?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cI thought that was clear,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a hundred reasons I want to help you in recovery, not the least of which is, I like you. And...I\u2019ve been there.\u201d</p><p>It worked. Lunch in Santa Rosa at a small Italian restaurant where they had pasta and iced tea and talked and the patrons behaved themselves. He held her hand across the table for a little while.</p><p>It was strange to Mike that he\u2019d first become attracted to a feisty, tough character and now, even though most of the time she was soft-spoken and had trouble maintaining eye contact, his feelings toward her hadn\u2019t changed all that much. He would welcome the old Brie back if she could fully recover\u2014but he realized that even if she remained this vulnerable, he was feeling something strong. Something he wasn\u2019t going to be able to let go of easily.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you tell your dad you were going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOut to lunch with you,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cI made sure he knew which restaurant and when I\u2019d be home. He was thrilled. Of course he wants me to get back into circulation. He has no idea how far I am from that. This is something...Well, it\u2019s not getting back into the world, but it\u2019s lunch with a friend. And that feels good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two weeks later they met in Santa Rosa again, this time at a French restaurant in a vineyard, again small, where Brie could see every patron. And two weeks later, again Santa Rosa. When he first saw her, he wanted to rush to her, grab her up in his arms and hold her for a while, but he always put his hands in his pockets, smiled and nodded hello. By the sixth week and fourth lunch, she hugged him goodbye. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cI think this helps.\u201d</p><p>In between lunches, there were the phone calls. When they talked, he was constantly reminded of the spunky, smart-ass woman he\u2019d fallen for. But he was faced with an uncertain woman; her confidence had been shattered. Yet in her core, this was the same woman\u2014honest, humorous, brave.</p><p>Mike was faced with a first-time challenge. He was gentle with her, and kind\u2014not difficult for him, because if anything he was a gentleman. But he had to work at making it seem he wasn\u2019t worried about her; that he held no pity for her, when in fact there was nothing quite as hard as knowing a woman he admired so profoundly, cared for so deeply, had been brutalized in such a way. He couldn\u2019t have her add his pain to her agenda\u2014her recovery was difficult enough. It wasn\u2019t easy to keep his concern from showing in his eyes, his smile. She needed strength now, not weakness. He would not be the weakness in her life.</p> <p>Neither of them ever mentioned Jack in their conversations, except when Brie talked about the family, about growing up, how she\u2019d missed him after he\u2019d left for the Marines. So far Jack had not mentioned the phone calls or lunches.</p><p>Summer was growing old. Mel and Jack had been back from Sacramento since June and the summer had been fraught with tension for Mel. Her fifteen-year-old patient was very much on her mind, as she had not returned to the clinic to be tested for STDs. She had two pregnant women in her care, not to mention the other patients who wandered into Doc Mullins\u2019s little clinic.</p><p>And her husband had not touched her in weeks.</p><p>Jack\u2019s routine was to go to his business early, chop wood, look at the schedule for the day, confer with Preacher and do what work was needed at the bar\u2014inventory, supply run, help serve at mealtime. Then, if he could get away, he would go out to their new homesite to work on the house in progress.</p><p>The latter seemed to occupy him more, because there he could be alone. And Jack suddenly seemed to need a great deal more time alone than he had before his sister\u2019s assault. He didn\u2019t talk about Brie\u2019s rape; he was stonily silent.</p> <p>Sometimes when there was nothing going on at Doc\u2019s, Mel would drive out to her new homesite with the baby and watch Jack driving nails into the wood, planing, leveling, hefting huge boards on his broad shoulders. Ordinarily, he stopped work immediately upon seeing her, spent a little time with her. But these days, these weeks, silence consumed him.</p><p>Brie called almost every day, because if she didn\u2019t call Jack would call her. She was improving both physically and emotionally, but Jack wasn\u2019t. Mel was painfully aware that this was the reason he hadn\u2019t made love to her in so long, and for them it might as well be an eternity. Their lovemaking had always been frequent and satisfying; sexually, they were a matched set. It was one of the driving forces in their marriage. Jack had strong urges, powerful urges, and Mel had learned to depend on the amazing fulfillment he brought her. Nothing could make her feel adored the way Jack did when he put his hands on her. She reciprocated, doing everything in her power to show him the depth of her love.</p><p>Knowing that it was the assault on Brie that was deeply troubling him, crippling his desire, she had exercised patience and understanding. But it was hard to lie beside him every night and not receive his usual advances. She understood his pain, his anger, but she also understood that she couldn\u2019t let her man brood forever.</p><p>She had to have him back.</p><p>A usual custom of theirs was to spend an hour or two at the bar at the end of the work day, perhaps having dinner, perhaps just a beer or cup of coffee with some of the patrons before going home to their own dinner. On this particular day, Mel simply went home. She hadn\u2019t even stopped by the bar to say goodbye. She fed the baby and put him down, showered, put on one of Jack\u2019s shirts and sat on the couch with the cool evening breezes drifting through the screen door. She could smell his scent on his shirt\u2014his special musk mixed with the wood and wind and river.</p><p>He called and asked where she was and she said, \u201cI decided to just come home tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there was no one to talk to at the bar,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she said. And then she said goodbye.</p><p>Of course it took him only about twenty minutes to make his excuses to Preacher and get home. Mel knew that to have confronted this any sooner might not have given Jack the time he needed to work through it. In fact, she worried that it might still be too soon, but she was hell-bent to try. It had been a long time. Too long. The health of her marriage was everything to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, coming in the cabin door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lonely,\u201d she said.</p><p>He sat down on the sofa beside her and hung his head. It was that hangdog look along with his silence that was eating at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mel,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I should have snapped out of it by now. I would have expected it sooner myself. I\u2019m not a weakling. But it\u2019s Brie...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJack, Brie needs you, and I want you to be there for her. I couldn\u2019t be married to any other kind of man. I hope you have a little left over, that\u2019s all. Because I love you so. I need you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve disappointed you. I\u2019ll do better...\u201d</p><p>She knelt on the couch beside him, facing him. \u201cKiss me,\u201d she said. He leaned his lips toward her, pressing his mouth against hers. He even made a noble effort to move his mouth over hers, opening and admitting her tongue. But there was no passion in it, no desire. He didn\u2019t put his hands on her, didn\u2019t draw her near, didn\u2019t moan with his usual hunger.</p><p>She was afraid she was losing him.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d she said, taking his hand and leading him to their bedroom. \u201cSit,\u201d she said.</p><p>She knelt in front of him and worked at taking off his boots. Then, rising on her knees, she began to unbutton his shirt. \u201cThis may not turn out the way you expect,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShhh. We\u2019ll see.\u201d She opened his shirt, pushed it off his shoulders and began to rub her hands over the soft mat of hair that covered his chest. She kissed his chest, running a small tongue over his nipples, one at a time. She pushed him back on the bed and slowly opened his belt, the snap on his jeans, the zipper. She kissed his belly. She hooked her small hands into his jeans and tugged, bringing them down over his hips. Down off his long legs. It did not escape her that he was barely rising to the occasion, and for Jack this was astonishing. He was known to spring to life at the mere suggestion there might be sex coming his way. But she wasn\u2019t discouraged. Down came the boxers and she caressed a little life into him, then put her mouth on him in exactly the way he loved.</p><p>And there was that moan that she had longed to hear. That deep groan. He couldn\u2019t remain passive during this, one of his very favorite treats. There. He responded, perhaps in spite of himself, but she didn\u2019t care. It was a start.</p><p>Jack had never in his life had a problem that kept him from wanting sex. In fact, during the worst stress of his life, he found sex to be a wonderful escape. But not this time\u2014this time he\u2019d been numb. He was barely aware it had been happening to him, and then his wife let him know when she came after him, demanding a response, and he suddenly realized that he hadn\u2019t deprived only himself in some pattern of grief. He felt her small mouth take him in, and his body allowed him blissful separation from his mind. He closed his eyes in luxury. She climbed on him, hot and sweet, and he ran his hands around her bottom and under the shirt she wore, up to her full breasts, and heard her hum in pleasure, \u201cOh, Jack\u2014I have so needed your hands on me.\u201d It hit him, how much they depended on each other. They should be helping each other through the difficult times, not closing off.</p><p>He lifted the shirt over her head and brought her breasts down to his mouth, tasting their sweetness. Then he rolled with her, bringing her beneath him, filling her, listening to her pleased sighs and purrs. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI never meant to neglect you.\u201d He moved and she bent her knees, lifted her hips to bring him deeper and deeper, her hands on his shoulders and arms, her mouth on his mouth.</p><p>This is what he loved about his woman, his wife\u2014that she was as driven sexually as he. In this they had been beautifully paired and it had taken boldness on her part to bring him back to life. He\u2019d never before suffered so long a dry spell, and it meant the world to him that she wouldn\u2019t allow it, that she was desperate for him, that she was determined to have this back in their marriage. Thank God for her, he thought. Anyone else would have become moody, angry, taken offense or even ignored the drought. But not Mel; she was committed to him. Committed to this passion they shared. She would not give it up easily.</p><p>He grabbed her small, tight fanny and held her to him, making it good, making it right, the perfect friction that caused her to gasp and cry out his name. He chuckled, a deep raspy laugh, for he adored this about her\u2014that she couldn\u2019t be quiet, that when he did the things he knew she loved, she was swept away, helpless.</p><p>When she heard that lusty laugh, the sound he made when he was again in control, focused on nothing but bringing her pleasure, making her body soar, she wrapped her legs around him and blasted him with an orgasm so hot and strong, he trembled. As she weakened beneath him, she knew immediately he had held himself back. Saved himself. He was going to do it to her again before he let himself go.</p><p>She touched his beautiful, sculptured face with her hands, saw the smile on his lips and the dark smoldering fire in his eyes, and said, \u201cWelcome home, darling. Welcome back.\u201d</p><p>Brie had to forcibly pry herself off the couch. She\u2019d rarely left her dad\u2019s house since it had happened. Most of her outings were to her counselor or support group and a lunch once in a while with Mike. Lunches she looked forward to with anxiety and delight. Sam, so afraid of making things worse, rocking her already rocky boat, hadn\u2019t said anything to her about it, but he knew. And she knew he knew.</p><p>Brad called almost every day, and while Brie wasn\u2019t really interested in talking to him, she knew he\u2019d tell her the truth about what was going on with the investigation. That was one of the things they\u2019d had in common from the beginning\u2014casework. Right now, if Brad could deliver the news that they had taken Powell into custody, it would make a huge difference in her life. But of course that had not yet happened.</p><p>Another person who called regularly was Christine, her former best friend and Brad\u2019s new woman. Those were calls Brie refused to take, but even Sam\u2019s advice that Christine stop calling had no impact. \u201cShe says that eventually you\u2019ll talk to her, let her tell you how worried she\u2019s been and how much she loves you,\u201d Sam reported to Brie.</p><p>Brie gave a huff of laughter. \u201cShe just loves way too many people, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>With every call, she\u2019d revisit that drama in her mind, still amazed by the way the whole thing had unfolded. They\u2019d been couple friends since before Brie and Brad married; Christine\u2019s husband was also a Sacramento cop, Glenn. Glenn and Christine had danced at their wedding. Christine was a surgical nurse who worked for a private practice surgeon; she and Brie had become close. In fact, besides her sisters, Christine had been the closest woman in her life. They\u2019d talked almost every day, seen each other at least a couple of times a week, with husbands or without.</p><p>Brie was aware that Christine and Glenn had some marital problems. They bickered over the usual things\u2014sex, money and parenting. With two demanding jobs, two little kids and a too-big house, it seemed to Brie they were destined to have certain squabbles until the kids got older, until they could mellow out and get ahead of the bills. But Brie was wrong\u2014a couple of years after Brie and Brad married, Christine and Glenn separated and divorced. They were almost more amicable than when they had been married. It wasn\u2019t too tough to sit on the fence on that one\u2014Brad saw Glenn at work and he\u2019d drop by the house for a beer occasionally, and Brie and Christine remained friends. After the shock of Glenn\u2019s moving out settled a little, it seemed to Brie that her best friend was in many ways calmer and happier on her own, managing her own money, getting a break from the kids a couple of days a week when Glenn took them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There were signs that Brie had taken no notice of. Christine didn\u2019t date or talk about men; a year after her divorce, their phone chats had become fewer\u2014but Christine was very busy. It wasn\u2019t easy being a single, working mom. And Brie\u2019s job was demanding, her hours long, so she was usually the one unavailable for girlfriend time. If she were honest, she could admit Christine had always done most of the phoning, inviting. What was still impossible for Brie to grasp was that Brad\u2019s behavior had never seemed to change. They talked on cell phones several times a day, were together every night Brad wasn\u2019t on duty, making love as often as before. Up until the time he told her he was leaving, that he needed some space, she had no idea anything was wrong.</p><p>Brie didn\u2019t know how it started between them, but Brad admitted it had been going on about a year. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Brad said with a helpless shrug. \u201cA couple of lonely people, I guess. Glenn was gone, you were always working and Christine and I were pretty close friends to start with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you are so full of shit!\u201d she railed at him. \u201cYou never once asked me to take time off! My hours were just what you needed to pull this off!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you have to believe, Brie,\u201d he had said.</p><p>It had knocked the wind out of her. The only thing worse than the pain was the shock and disbelief. Six months after the divorce was final, she\u2019d thought she\u2019d made some important headway in dealing with it, but it was as though the rape brought it all back; her depression over the divorce seemed suddenly brand-new. Robbed, again and again, she kept thinking.</p><p>Most of the time all she did was watch TV, snack, sleep, tidy up the house. Her concentration wasn\u2019t good enough to read a novel\u2014something she had craved when work had been so consuming. Working a crossword puzzle was out of the question\u2014she couldn\u2019t focus; she used to do the Sunday-morning crossword in ink before Brad even got out of bed. She couldn\u2019t even go to the mall. But she made it to those lunches with Mike. She came to think of them as her secret lunches, almost the only thing that brought her away from herself, away from all the blows of the past year. Her father\u2019s silence on the matter intrigued her; she hadn\u2019t even whispered of these meetings to her sisters. It was as if that would take the magic away.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even recognize the woman she\u2019d become. She\u2019d been so tough. Some people\u2014mostly men\u2014thought of her as hard. At the moment she was limp and frightened. She was paranoid and afraid it would never pass. She\u2019d been dealing with the victims of crimes for years now, and a number of them had been rape victims. She had watched them wither, paralyzed, unable to act on their own behalf. As she cajoled and coached them for their testimonies, she would become frustrated and angry by the reduction of feeling that seemed to weigh them down, overwhelm them. The helplessness. The impotence. And now she was one of them.</p><p>I\u2019m not giving in, she kept telling herself. Still, it had taken her weeks. Months. \u201cI need some exercise,\u201d she told Mike during one of their lunches. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to get out of bed or off the couch if I don\u2019t have a specific appointment or lunch with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you asked anyone for an antidepressant?\u201d he asked. \u201cI thought it was pretty routine after a crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go that route if I can help it. Up to now, I\u2019ve always had so much energy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went that route,\u201d he admitted to her. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I needed to, but it became clear I was depressed\u2014a combination of major surgery and being the victim of a violent crime. It helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re going to have to think of an alternative or this thing can swallow you up,\u201d he said. \u201cBrie, fight back. Fight back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t look like it, but I am.\u201d</p> <p>He touched her hand gently and said, softly but earnestly, \u201cFight harder! I can\u2019t lose you to this!\u201d</p><p>Well, she couldn\u2019t jog anymore\u2014she was afraid to be out there alone, even in broad daylight. It couldn\u2019t be a gym or health club\u2014she couldn\u2019t have men looking at her right now. She remembered with some longing how she had loved being looked at. She had a small, compact, fit little body and lots of long, silky hair that she braided for court but let swing freely down her back the rest of the time. It made her heady with power to garner the stares of attractive men. Now if a man looked at her, it threw her into panic.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t going down without a fight\u2014so she joined a women\u2019s gym and started running on the treadmill and lifting weights. If she couldn\u2019t have a full life, she was at least going to fake one.</p><p>The joke was on her\u2014a couple of weeks of vigorous exercise and she was sleeping better and eating better. She felt it put her into the next stage of recovery, every day a tiny bit easier than the day before.</p><p>There were times she thought that if not for Mike\u2019s attention right now, she\u2019d be lost. Oh, her family was amazing\u2014the way they managed to hold strong for her, encourage her and make themselves constantly available should she want to talk. But Mike, the very man she had vowed would never get near her when she recognized his flirting last spring, was the only thing in her life that allowed her to feel like a woman. For that she would be forever grateful.</p><p>Tommy Booth was the new kid in town, just checking in for his senior year at Valley High School. His father, Walt Booth, had just retired from the Army and had given Tommy his choice\u2014a military academy, a nonmilitary private academy or Valley High. Tommy chose to live with his dad for a couple of reasons\u2014he\u2019d lost his mom in a car accident a few years ago and it had just been him and his dad since, a couple of bachelors who got along fairly well for father and son. And his older sister, married and pregnant and separated from her husband by the Marine Corps, was going to come to Virgin River to live with them until Matt, his brother-in-law, got back from the Middle East. She was going to have her baby there\u2014and Tom was secretly a little excited about that. Plus, there were his horses, which he couldn\u2019t take to a private school.</p><p>Tom\u2019s father, a retired three-star general, had found this property a couple of years ago; the general had a younger sister and niece a few hours south in Bodega Bay and had looked all over California for the right spot, not too far away from them. Aunt Midge was sick; she had been sick several years, bedridden the past three. She was worse than sick\u2014she was terminal, with Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, and her daughter, Shelby, was her full-time caregiver. Walt Booth had been ready to settle in Bodega Bay to be there for her even though he was more of a forest and mountains than beach kind of guy. But Midge had convinced him not to choose Bodega Bay because of her presence there\u2014she wasn\u2019t going to last more than a couple of years. She might be gone by the time Walt retired from the Army and if she was not, he could visit. Thus, Virgin River\u2014close enough to see Midge and Shelby as often as he could, but the kind of place Walt wanted to put down his final roots. It had begun to look as if Aunt Midge was right\u2014she couldn\u2019t possibly have much longer. By the time Walt and Tommy got to Virgin River, Midge needed twenty-four-hour care, and Hospice was on the scene.</p><p>While Walt finished his last assignment at the Pentagon, he\u2019d had the house renovated via long distance and the new stable and corral constructed. Tommy had seen it only once before actually moving in, but he loved the land\u2014the enormous trees, the rivers, the coast, the mountainsides and valleys through which he could ride.</p> <p>Classes started in late August. He wasn\u2019t that jazzed about the high school. The kids sure weren\u2019t as sophisticated as the D.C. kids. And Tom was a little bit on the shy side until he got to know someone. This being a small-town high school, all the cliques had been established ages ago, so fitting in was going to take a while. He was a big kid, athletic, but he\u2019d been too late for football.</p><p>He met a kid in first period right off\u2014Jordan Whitley, a funny guy. Kind of skinny and hyper, but really friendly. He hung out with him a couple of times after school. Jordan lived pretty close to the school, while Tom had to drive his little red truck all the way from Virgin River every day. Also, Jordan\u2019s parents were divorced, he was an only child and his mom worked\u2014which freed up Jordan\u2019s house until about six. As long as Tom got home before dinner, in time to take care of the horses, it was no big deal to go over there for a little while after school.</p><p>Tom also learned that there were frequent keggers at an abandoned rest stop area right at the edge of Virgin River. Weekend parties that Jordan really wanted him to attend, but Tom always had an excuse. He didn\u2019t know anyone but Jordan. And he was quiet about the fact that he had a house to himself for a few days every other week or so while Walt went to Bodega Bay. He wasn\u2019t about to be overrun by Jordan and his tribe\u2014if Walt ever found out, he\u2019d be dead meat.</p><p>Jordan somehow managed to score beer at his house. After-school beer. Tom was very careful about that because if the general smelled it on his breath he was toast. But the other thing Jordan had going on was girls. He seemed to always have a different girl. So far Tommy hadn\u2019t seen one that got him excited\u2014Jordan didn\u2019t seem to draw the really pretty ones. But it was kind of fun to go over to his house and get all the flirtatious attention bestowed on him, being the new kid and not that bad looking.</p><p>\u201cCome on over to my buddy Brendan\u2019s Friday night,\u201d Jordan invited. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Tommy grinned. \u201cWho you gonna get lucky with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got this girl who wants me so bad she can\u2019t hold herself back. And she\u2019s on the pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to come over and watch you get lucky? I might have to pass on that,\u201d he said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s bringing a girlfriend,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cI might come by for a beer,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cLet me think about it. I don\u2019t know this Brendan guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cool,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cHe graduated a couple of years ago, and when his mom goes out of town, which she does a lot, the house is his. And if we get lucky, we can get lucky all night long, if you get my drift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I get your drift,\u201d he said. And he was thinking, you idiots. You don\u2019t go banging the local girls who advertise they\u2019re on the pill. He wasn\u2019t stupid\u2014that\u2019s how you got stuff. Bad stuff. An image of telling his dad he had the drip sent shivers up his spine.</p><p>But he went. He popped the top on two beers, total, without finishing either one; he knew better than to drink anything out of a keg or punch bowl. There was a little pot floating around, though not everyone indulged. Tommy didn\u2019t get near that shit. Too risky for a kid planning on West Point; too risky for a boy with a father like Walt, who would dismember him before killing him.</p><p>The girlfriend who was earmarked for Tom if he was interested was way too aggressive and ready for anything, and he just couldn\u2019t see it. Plus, Jordan and Brendan were busy getting everyone as shit-faced as possible, as quickly as possible, and there was nothing quite as funny to watch\u2014but inevitably boring. He finally slipped away about nine without anyone really noticing he was gone.</p><p>The next Monday morning at school Jordan excitedly asked, \u201cWhere\u2019d you go, man?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI had to get home. My dad is pretty strict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we had beer and girls!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a couple of beers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the girls... Well, I didn\u2019t meet one I really liked.\u201d</p><p>That made Jordan laugh almost hysterically. \u201cWell, so what? You\u2019re not...? You don\u2019t still have your cherry, do you, man?\u201d</p><p>In fact, he did. \u201c\u2019Course not,\u201d he said, because what do you say to something like that? Tom hadn\u2019t made it with a girl, but not because he couldn\u2019t. Because he was very careful and he and the last girlfriend back in D.C. had barely graduated to some petting before he moved away. He was in a desperate hurry to find a great girl, but she\u2019d have to be a great girl, not just someone who\u2019d put out. In fact, a girl who put out was kind of a put-off. And if he found a great girl, he was going to be a great guy to her, not someone out for himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome over after school,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cMaybe we can hook you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Jord, I know you\u2019re just trying to be a good friend and get me laid, but how about you worry about you and I\u2019ll take care of myself. Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, man, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing!\u201d</p> <p>But Tom had seen the girls, the beer and pot, and he thought\u2014actually, I think I do know what I\u2019m missing. He hadn\u2019t met anyone through Jordan who interested him. So far. \u201cYou take care of you\u2014I\u2019ll take care of me.\u201d</p><p>Still, Jordan was one of the few friends he\u2019d made. And Jordan loved coming out to the ranch and hanging around the horses sometimes. The general didn\u2019t like him, but didn\u2019t have a really good reason. Tom found himself a little torn\u2014grateful to have a friend at all, but hopeful that someone a little more substantive would show up before too long.</p><p>A young man came into the bar and claimed a stool right in front of Jack. He was clearly under thirty. Jack eyed the polo shirt, khaki pants and loafers\u2014not the mountain attire most commonly seen around here. This guy was not hunting, fishing or splitting logs. He gave the counter a wipe and said, \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our specialty,\u201d Jack said, serving him up a cold draft. \u201cPassing through?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, as a matter of fact. At least I hope that\u2019s a no\u2014I just started teaching at Valley High School. I thought I\u2019d get to know some of the folks around here.\u201d He took a pull on his beer. \u201cYou have any high schoolers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrace yourself,\u201d Jack said, lifting his coffee cup. \u201cI have a new baby. By the time he gets to high school, I\u2019ll have a walker.\u201d</p><p>The young man laughed. He put out a hand. \u201cZach Hadley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Sheridan. Welcome aboard. How do you like it so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little out of my experience, to tell you the truth. I\u2019m used to a bigger school, city kids. But I wanted to give a rural community a try.\u201d He grinned. \u201cThe kids find me real interesting\u2014they laugh at my clothes.\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned. \u201cLotta ranchers, farmers, vintners and that sort of thing around here. That, and hunting and fishing.\u201d He nodded at the young man. \u201cNot a lot of golf.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that what I look like? A golfer?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cFigures.\u201d</p><p>Mel came into the bar, the baby on her hip. She passed the baby right across the bar to Jack. Jack hefted the baby and said, \u201cMr. Hadley, meet David, your future student.\u201d David laughed, put a finger in his mouth and farted, bringing a big laugh out of Jack.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s just warming up. He\u2019s going to be one of the fun ones, I can tell.\u201d</p><p>Jack reached underneath the bar for the backpack. He very deftly slipped David into it and then the straps over his shoulders. \u201cMel,\u201d he said, while getting David comfortable. \u201cMeet Zach Hadley, new high school teacher in town.\u201d</p><p>They shook hands and Zach explained he was renting a small place outside Clear River and was just getting around, meeting neighbors and parents of his kids. \u201cWell, you\u2019re here at the right time,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThe locals will start turning out for a beer or cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you run this place with your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m a nurse practitioner and midwife. I work across the street with Doc Mullins in his clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a fact?\u201d he asked, intrigued.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fact no one around here gives birth in daylight,\u201d Jack said, serving his wife a short beer.</p><p>\u201cMy very able helper,\u201d Mel said. \u201cWhen I have a delivery at Doc\u2019s, Jack usually sits up through the night in case I need him for anything.\u201d</p><p>Mike came into the bar, took his place beside Mel. Jack introduced him as a former LAPD police officer who\u2019d served with him in the Marine Corps. Next was Doc.</p><p>\u201cYou know, there\u2019s a lot of interesting experience in this little bar. I bet it would be good for some of the kids to hear about your career choices. How about it?\u201d</p><p>Mike said, \u201cI\u2019ve done that, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have? How\u2019d it go?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cThey wanted to know two things\u2014have I ever shot anyone and have I ever been shot. My answers were yes, and not yet. Shortly after that I was shot. I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll get the department any recruits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to talk to the kids about birth control, sexually transmitted disease and sexual assault,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for a way into the school\u2014this is pretty conservative country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d Jack said, \u201cZach was just saying he\u2019s new and hopes he\u2019s not just passing through.\u201d Preacher came into the bar with a rack of clean glasses. \u201cPreacher, meet Zach, new high school teacher in town. He\u2019s looking for some volunteers to talk to his students about their career choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, man,\u201d Preacher said, shoving his rack under the bar, wiping a big meaty hand on his apron and sticking it out. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could talk about being a chef,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Preacher looked at Zach, smiled and said, \u201cNo way in hell. I barely talk to my own wife. Welcome to town.\u201d Then he went straight back to the kitchen.</p><p>Zach leaned over the bar and looked past Mike and Mel to Doc. \u201cDr. Mullins?\u201d he questioned hopefully.</p><p>Doc lifted his one whiskey of the day along with a bushy white eyebrow. He sipped, put the whiskey down and said, \u201cIn your dreams, young man.\u201d</p><p>Zach picked up his beer and said, very good-naturedly, \u201cThat went well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what you got yourself here, young man,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou got yourself an excellent place to have a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you, Jack? You\u2019d do it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Zach. I\u2019ll go tell the kids all the advantages of owning your very own bar. Right after that, Mel can teach them sexual responsibility. Kind of a little family business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Zach said. \u201cAn excellent place to have a beer.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>Sue and Doug Carpenter and Carrie and Fish Bristol\u2014best couple friends\u2014had been having an after-work beer at Jack\u2019s a couple of times a week since he opened, so Mel knew them well. And Sue had called Mel to make an appointment for her sixteen-year-old daughter. On the phone she had said, \u201cThe girl is pregnant and we have to do something.\u201d Well, this was Mel\u2019s job\u2014to give medical attention to pregnant women, whatever their age or marital status. And Sue was a bit put out that Mel insisted on seeing her patient alone first.</p><p>\u201cWhat have we got, Brenda?\u201d Mel asked, looking at the chart.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she said. \u201cFigures.\u201d</p><p>Mel looked up from the chart. Brenda was a high school junior. From gossip between the Carpenters and Bristols at the bar, Mel had gathered that this girl was an honor student, cheerleader, student council officer\u2014a leader. College bound; scholarship material. Nature certainly doesn\u2019t discriminate, Mel thought. \u201cDo you know how many periods you\u2019ve missed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree. Can you get rid of it?\u201d</p><p>Mel tilted her head, surprised by the caustic edge to the girl\u2019s question. Brenda had always been soft-spoken, on the sweet side. The tragedy was usually that these young girls were ready to throw away their lives, their promising futures, based on some immature romance with a young boy. Didn\u2019t sound as if Brenda was suffering from that syndrome. \u201cYou have lots of options, but first things first\u2014how about I examine you to be sure that\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said shortly. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get you in this gown. Everything off. And I\u2019ll be back. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Rather than answer, Brenda snatched the gown and didn\u2019t even wait for Mel to leave before she began undressing.</p><p>Mel went to the kitchen, had a sip of her diet cola and ran this over in her mind. Maybe Brenda was just mad at her mother for finding out. Maybe the boy had taken off. Maybe a lot of things, she thought. She reminded herself to stick to the facts for now.</p><p>She gave Brenda a few minutes, knowing better than to stretch this out for too long. Brenda didn\u2019t need to settle her nerves; she needed to get this over with.</p><p>\u201cHave you had a pelvic before?\u201d Mel asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said shortly. \u201cJust do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Mel said. \u201cBut let me get your blood pressure and listen to your heart first, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenda, excuse me, but are you angry with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am angry in general,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mel sat on her stool and looked up at the girl. \u201cBecause...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, people make mistakes. You\u2019re human...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? I could live with that if I knew I was making a mistake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s back up a little. Want to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother? Do it, okay? You\u2019ll just think I\u2019m as stupid as I already think I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me,\u201d Mel said, crossing her legs, resting her arms on her knee.</p><p>\u201cI went to a party. A kegger. I got drunk. I woke up sick. Puking sick. The guy I was with said he passed out and nothing happened. But obviously someone is lying if I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Mel couldn\u2019t help herself\u2014her mouth dropped open. \u201cBrenda, you told your mother about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until two periods didn\u2019t come, because how was I going to know? I did one of those home test things. I never thought it would be...positive....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you sore? In your vagina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sore everywhere! Like I\u2019d fallen down a flight of stairs! And so sick I wanted to die. My vagina was about the last thing on my mind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you woke up\u2014you were dressed? Any evidence of rape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely dressed. Right down to the vomit on my shirt. And in my hair,\u201d she added with a shudder.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were with friends? Anyone see anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was with a couple of girlfriends and one useless guy. They were all as drunk as me. We\u2019d never... It was like the first time for something like that. I\u2019ve had maybe one or two beers, but I\u2019ve never been to a kegger before. I\u2019m obviously not much of a drinker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember drinking a lot?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember much of anything. A couple of the guys said I was totally shitty. Drunk out of my mind. And one of my girlfriends swears my date really did pass out right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver think there could have been a drug involved? Slipped into your beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of drug?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d Mel asked her.</p><p>\u201cI think I got hammered and let some guy\u2014 Obviously I wasn\u2019t in a position to make a good decision. Plus, these are my friends. Well, the girls I went with are my friends\u2014they wouldn\u2019t lie to me. I don\u2019t hang out with the other ones who were there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them were your friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s not\u2014unless there was a guy there who also doesn\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Mel leaned forward. It was in her mind to ask Brenda if she\u2019d ever heard the term, whiskey dick. \u201cAn unfortunate reality for most males is that too much alcohol inhibits erection or ejaculation. Whoever did this remembers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is lying...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, somebody\u2019s lying\u2014and if you\u2019re pregnant and can\u2019t remember getting that way, it probably isn\u2019t you. Brenda, you could have been raped.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOr\u2014I could have been so stupid drunk I didn\u2019t know what I was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing, in my mind,\u201d Mel said with a shrug. \u201cHave you talked to the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She laughed bitterly. \u201cRight.\u201d</p> <p>Mel reached out a hand to touch her knee and Brenda flinched.

Why wouldn\u2019t he? And I would never be able to say otherwise, since I don\u2019t fricking know. Meanwhile not only the whole school, but the whole town would know Brenda is a whore. Brenda\u2019s knocked up, Brenda would like everyone to believe she was drugged.\u201d She laughed at Mel. \u201cWho are we kidding? Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that likely? Let me tell you something\u2014girls who aren\u2019t sexually active don\u2019t usually have one occasion of getting drunk and waking up pregnant because they wanted it.\u201d Brenda looked away. \u201cHave you been sexually active? Not that it matters in this case.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes came back and the anger had seeped away. \u201cI had a boyfriend last year who... I really liked him a lot. But we didn\u2019t go all the way.\u201d She looked down. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give it up. I wanted to be sure, wanted it to be special. You know?\u201d Now there were tears in her eyes, but they vanished as quickly as they had come.</p><p>Mel touched her hand. \u201cIt\u2019ll still be special, honey,\u201d Mel said, standing up. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready, it\u2019ll be special. Let\u2019s do an exam, test you for sexually transmitted disease, get a blood workup for HIV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-I-Vee?\u201d she asked, stricken. \u201cOh, fuck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing at a time, Brenda. Are you up-to-date on the hepatitis B vaccine for school immunizations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHepatitis B?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also an STD,\u201d Mel said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Brenda said weakly.</p><p>\u201cTake it easy, sweetheart. Feet here, in the stirrups, slide down for me, that\u2019s it.\u201d She put on her gloves. \u201cTake a deep breath, let it out slowly and relax your muscles as much as possible. There you go.\u201d Mel took a look and noted some inflammation, tenderness. She did her pap slide, then inserted a swab in the cervical area to test for chlamydia and gonorrhea. \u201cI\u2019m going to let that swab sit for a moment. Listen, do you remember the people who were at that party? And where it was?\u201d</p><p>Brenda put the back of her hand on her forehead and her chin quivered. \u201cAll I want to do is get it out of me and get on with my life. School already started and everything....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that, but I\u2019m worried. This isn\u2019t a situation we should ignore. What if some other young woman is attacked like this, made pregnant without even consenting to sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr remembering that she consented?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember any bruising? On your arms, pelvis, hips? Buttocks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy chest was really sore, and so was my throat. I thought it was from throwing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Mel asked. Brenda put her palm against her upper chest, on her sternum, right above her breasts. \u201cOn the outside? Like you\u2019d been hit in the chest by a...by a basketball or something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, apparently surprised by how well the analogy fit.</p><p>Mel finished her exam and helped Brenda sit up. \u201cWould you be willing to talk to someone about this? Like maybe one of the nurses at the family planning clinic? Give whatever details you can remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the future protection of some girl who doesn\u2019t know what dangers lurk at a kegger?\u201d Mel said.</p><p>Brenda looked down miserably. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to expose you. No one\u2019s going to confront anyone without charges being filed. But for right now\u2014you deserve better than to have no idea what happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. I\u2019ll have to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Get dressed. But first\u2014will you tell me one thing? The party. Was it here? In Virgin River?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cRight here.\u201d</p><p>Mel had a long chat with a nurse in the family planning clinic in Eureka. She agreed that it was very important to interview this patient, but before that could even happen, Brenda miscarried. Less than a week later the test results came back positive for chlamydia.</p><p>Mel immediately got in touch with Carra Winslow. She was a little past caring if a parent answered the phone, but fortunately for Carra, it was she who picked up. Mel was straightforward\u2014she told her there was a venereal disease making the rounds and it was imperative that Carra return to the clinic for testing.</p><p>She also tested positive for chlamydia. Mel fixed her up with antibiotics and made her promise to return to the clinic in a couple of months to follow up. Carra still refused birth control; she was no longer seeing the two-week boyfriend. And even though he had given her an infection, she still wouldn\u2019t blame him or name him.</p><p>But this weighed on Mel\u2019s mind mightily. She was afraid they might have a serious problem in her town.</p><p>September and October brought a time of year that Mel disliked, though it was good for the bar. Bear- and deer-hunting season. Since there was no hunting inside the Virgin River town limits, the hunters they saw were those who passed through town en route to and from the lodges and camps in Shasta and the Trinity Alps where some of the best hunting was found. As a rule, these were a decent lot of men and even a few women, many of whom had been seen at Jack\u2019s in previous years and made it a point to stop by to enjoy Preacher\u2019s cooking. And Preacher went to a little extra trouble, knowing they\u2019d bring their money and high expectations. They didn\u2019t change the pricing of their food and drinks for the hunters\u2014it was all sold on the cheap, catering first to the town. But Jack did lay in some of the finer liquors, like Johnnie Walker Blue, because this was a monied crowd who liked their drinks. And they always left a lot more money on the bar and tables than they were charged.</p><p>City girl that she was, Mel abhorred the sight of a beautiful buck tied to the roof of an SUV or tossed in the back of a truck. Having already been through one hunting season and being married to a man who happened to enjoy the hunt, she\u2019d learned to say very little.</p><p>Jack and Preacher had always catered to the hunters and fishermen\u2014it was one of the reasons Jack had built the place. During the season, the bar stayed open a little later if there were people around, and still opened at the crack of dawn. Jack usually stayed to help out until at least nine, sending Mel home to get David settled for the night.</p><p>At a time of day when Mel might already have been and gone from her dinner hour, she had a call to make with Doc, and brought the baby to Jack. Being over five months now, husky and strong, David was most often seen riding happily in Jack\u2019s backpack as opposed to the front sling he had occupied in earlier months. As Mel slipped the straps over Jack\u2019s shoulders, she said, \u201cHe\u2019s fed and changed and I shouldn\u2019t be too long.\u201d</p><p>Mike was having his dinner at the bar when six hunters came in. Since Jack didn\u2019t greet them as men he\u2019d seen before, Mike assumed this might be their first time through town. These were young men, all in their twenties, and obviously having a good time. All six went up to the bar, made a few jokes about the bartender being part-time babysitter, which Jack took in good-natured stride. They eschewed dinner, opting for some drinks. Once Jack had set them up with beer and shots, they retired to a table, where they enjoyed rehashing every aspect of their hunt.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think is the designated driver in that crowd?\u201d Mike asked Jack.</p><p>Jack was watching, but said nothing. And Mike was watching Jack, because the latter had a good sense for things. Getting a little loud and rowdy was not frowned upon here, so long as you could keep your head. These boys were hanging in there, though they were ordering up more beer and shots; they wanted a pitcher and a bottle and were getting a little louder by the shot.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before Paige came out of the kitchen. \u201cHave you asked them about dinner?\u201d she asked Jack.</p><p>\u201cLast time I offered, they weren\u2019t interested,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me just check before we close the kitchen.\u201d She went to their table to ask them if they wanted anything to eat. \u201cMy husband has a great lasagna and garlic bread, but also some broiled, stuffed sturgeon fresh off the river and steamed vegetables, if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHusband?\u201d one of them chortled. \u201cDamn, my hunting sucks no matter where I go.\u201d</p><p>She instinctively retreated a step and the man reached for her hand, pulling her back. \u201cYou can get rid of the husband, can\u2019t you, sweetheart?\u201d His buddies laughed at his brazenness and Mike thought, shit. This is not a good thing; you don\u2019t want to mess with Preacher\u2019s woman. He looked across the bar at Jack\u2019s narrowed eyes. Oh, boy.</p><p>Paige simply pulled her hand back, smiled politely and didn\u2019t grapple with them any longer over food. As she would have gone back to the kitchen, Jack stopped her and asked her to take David. He slid the backpack off his shoulders and into her hands and one of the hunters yelled over to Jack, \u201cThat the wife, buddy?\u201d And Jack\u2019s mouth curved in a slow smile as he shook his head\u2014no, you don\u2019t really want to meet her husband.</p><p>Now, what none of these idiots knew was that Jack hadn\u2019t had a nice summer. His sister\u2019s trauma was not that long past and he\u2019d been in a real mood. There was a side of Jack that was all soft, crushed concern and a side that wanted to kill someone. This was not a great time to screw with him. Since Jack had shed the baby, a telling move, Mike thought it might be worth it to try to head this off. He stood up from his meal at the end of the bar and walked over to their table. He flipped around a chair from a neighboring table and, straddling the back, he said, \u201cHey, boys. You have a good hunt?\u201d</p><p>They eyed him suspiciously. One of them said, \u201cOne buck\u2014young. Not much to brag about. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cName\u2019s Mike\u2014how you doing? Listen, I just thought I\u2019d mention\u2014you don\u2019t want to overdo it. Especially if you\u2019re driving out tonight.\u201d</p><p>They started to laugh, meeting eyes with each other as though sharing some kind of private joke. \u201cThat a fact?\u201d one asked. \u201cAnd who put you in charge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in charge of anything,\u201d he said. \u201cBut gee\u2014I\u2019d hate to see anyone get hurt. These roads,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cSometimes pretty tight around the curves going down. And real, real dark. No lights. No guard rails.\u201d</p><p>Right then, Mel came into the bar, hung her jacket on the peg inside the door and jumped up on a stool in front of her husband, elbows on the bar, leaning toward him for a kiss.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d one of the men said. \u201cLook at that one. Talk about a doe I\u2019d like to bag.\u201d</p><p>Jack straightened before meeting his wife\u2019s lips. The look on his face wasn\u2019t a pretty one.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Mike said, laughing uncomfortably, \u201cabout our women. You boys don\u2019t want to be giving the women around here any trouble. Trust me on this, okay?\u201d</p><p>That set up a round of hilarious laughter at the table of hunters and one of them said, unfortunately too loudly, \u201cMaybe the girl wants to get bagged. I think we should at least ask her!\u201d But oops\u2014glancing over his shoulder, Mike saw Jack had heard that. And probably so had Mel. And after what those two had been through earlier in the summer, comments like that were not taken lightly.</p><p>And that\u2019s when Mike became convinced that these guys had been pretty well oiled before they hit Virgin River. They had absolutely no judgment. Hunting and drinking was a thing he disliked\u2014frowned on by him and his brothers, both the Mexican brothers and Marines. Drinking after the hunt\u2014that was another story. Especially if the shooting was done, the guns unloaded and stowed, and all you were going to do was walk out back to your camper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked back over his shoulder in time to see Jack whisper something to Mel. Mel jumped off the stool, disappeared into the back and Mike thought, oh fuck. He stood. \u201cOkay, boys. Settle up for your drinks and hit the road. While you can still see straight. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, chico. We\u2019re not quite done here.\u201d</p><p>Chico? He hated it when people did that. You don\u2019t want to call a Mexican man a little boy.</p> <p>Out of the corner of his eye Mike saw him. He\u2019d known he would. Preacher had come out of the kitchen and stood behind the bar next to Jack, arms crossed over his massive chest, those big, black eyebrows drawn together in a frown that only Preacher could effect with such a look of menace. The diamond stud in his ear seemed to twinkle. Jack had sent Mel for him. They were ready to mix it up with these guys, defend the place.</p><p>Mike absently worked his shoulder a little bit, loosening it up. He couldn\u2019t remember hearing about a bar fight around here. Certainly not since Preacher had come on full-time. You\u2019d have to be drunk and stupid to get into it with him.</p><p>These guys looked pretty fit. Lots younger by average than Jack, Preacher and Mike. But they\u2019d been doing a lot of drinking, whereas that evening shot before closing had yet to be poured for the crew running the bar. The home team had been on coffee.</p><p>As Mike knew, Jack hated it when his bar got messed up. It was a sacrifice he\u2019d make if threatened, but it made him very unhappy. Maybe he\u2019d stay behind the bar and just let them wander off. Or maybe he\u2019d enjoy a little fight, having had the kind of summer he\u2019d had.</p><p>\u201cCome on, boys. Get going. You really don\u2019t want to mess this place up...\u201d Mike said.</p> <p>The hunters exchanged looks, then slowly stood. They began to move away from the table, having left no money to pay for their drinks, which was a sure clue trouble was coming. The one in the group closest to Mike whirled suddenly, landing a blow right to Mike\u2019s face. It sent him skittering backward, his hand to his lip, ending up against the bar. He said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re going to hate yourself.\u201d</p><p>He wound up and hit back, left-handed, sending his assailant flying into his boys, knocking two of them off balance.</p><p>It started. Preacher and Jack were around the bar before Mike even delivered his first blow. Preacher knocked two heads together, Jack landed a blow to one gut, another jaw. Mike grabbed up his attacker, decked him again and then sent him into another guy, downing them both. Someone came at Jack with a ready fist, which Jack caught easily, twisted his assailant\u2019s arm around his back and shoved him into his boys. In less than two minutes, six partially inebriated young hunters were on the bar floor, spread over some broken glasses and amidst toppled chairs and two tables. All of them were moaning. Besides that first blow to Mike\u2019s face, they hadn\u2019t even managed contact. The heartiest of the bunch got back on his feet and Preacher grabbed him by the front of his jacket, lifted him off the floor and said, \u201cYou really wanna be this stupid?\u201d He instantly put up his hands and Preacher dropped him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, we\u2019re out of here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that, guys,\u201d Mike said. He yelled, \u201cPaige!\u201d She stuck her head into the bar. \u201cRope!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on, man,\u201d someone said.</p> <p>\u201cJust get \u2019em the hell out of here,\u201d Jack said, disgusted.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Mike returned. Then to the hunters, \u201cHell, I tried to warn you. You don\u2019t want to mess with the women. You don\u2019t want to fight. Not around here. Jesus,\u201d he said in disgust. \u201cShit for brains.\u201d</p><p>Mike explained to Jack that not only were these boys too drunk to drive down the mountain, they might get down the road and claim they\u2019d been jumped. Since they had all the bruises and the home team had only sore knuckles, it just wouldn\u2019t be smart to take that kind of chance. Better to let the police handle things now. Fifteen minutes later each one of them was tied to a porch rail out front, and a half hour after that three sheriff\u2019s deputies were standing around the front of the bar, assessing the damage.</p><p>\u201cMerciful God,\u201d Deputy Henry Depardeau said. \u201cEvery time I turn around, somebody\u2019s getting beat up or shot around here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Henry, we\u2019re awful sorry,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe hardly ever have any trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was it this time?\u201d he asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cThat one,\u201d Jack said, pointing. \u201cHe threw the first punch. That was so frickin\u2019 rude, don\u2019t you think? You can see, it was just out of line. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking up way too much of my time!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you dinner one of these days, how about that? You and your boys just drop in anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. All right, let\u2019s load \u2019em up. I sure hope you boys have yourselves licenses and your deer tag.\u201d By the droop of one hunter\u2019s head, it looked as if there were going to be more fines. It made Jack laugh. \u201cAw, man,\u201d Henry said. \u201cPoachers are usually quiet and polite so they can slip in and out of here unnoticed. I should book you for stupid.\u201d</p><p>Hope McCrea, a feisty old widow, was almost a daily visitor at Jack\u2019s. She liked to have a Jack Daniel\u2019s and a cigarette at the end of the day. She\u2019d often sit up at the bar next to Doc, but there were times Mike talked with her a while.</p><p>\u201cYou know I hired Mel to come up here, right?\u201d Hope asked Mike one night.</p><p>\u201cI heard that, yeah,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to come out to the house to talk about something. A proposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Hope.\u201d He grinned. \u201cThat sounds real interesting....\u201d</p><p>\u201cA job, you young fool,\u201d she said, pushing her too-big glasses up on her nose. But she had a toothy smile for him just the same.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a job, Hope,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. Jack will tell you how to get there. Tomorrow. Four o\u2019clock.\u201d She stamped out her cigarette and left.</p><p>Mike drove out to Hope\u2019s house the next day because Jack had said it might be at least worth listening to. Hope was seventy-seven and had been widowed for over twenty years. She had given Mel a contract for a year, paid her out of her own accounts plus the cabin she was living in, now with her husband and child. After that one-year contract was exhausted, Doc had pulled Mel into his practice and they\u2019d managed a modest salary for her without help from Hope, which was exactly what Hope had intended. Mike had learned this from Jack.</p><p>Now, according to Jack, what she wanted was a town cop, and she hoped the same thing would happen\u2014that she would pay him a salary from her savings for a year and the town would realize it was a positive addition and manage to pull together enough for his salary.</p><p>Hope lived about five miles out of town in a big old Victorian home that she and her husband had bought fifty years ago. They\u2019d never had children and so had filled the place up with junk. \u201cI\u2019ve never been inside,\u201d Jack had told Mike, \u201cbut the rumor is that Hope hasn\u2019t thrown away a thing in seventy years.\u201d After her husband died, Hope had sold off the acreage to her neighbors for farming and grazing land.</p><p>He pulled up to the remarkable old house and found her on the porch with her coffee and cigarettes and a folder full of papers. When he stepped up on the porch, she greeted him with a victorious smile and said, \u201cI knew I would get you eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019d be getting, Hope. I have no idea how to be a small-town cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho does? But you have lots of law enforcement experience, and clearly we can use it. Lately we seem to have had our share of problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot from Virgin River people, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference? If it happens in Virgin River, it becomes our problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got there?\u201d he asked, indicating the folder.</p><p>\u201cJust paperwork. I had to get a little legal help from a county attorney. Here\u2019s what I can do\u2014I can hire you as a local security officer, a constable. Even though you\u2019ve graduated from one of the toughest police academies in the country, you wouldn\u2019t be recognized by the state as an official law enforcement officer, but that really doesn\u2019t matter. If you run across a lawbreaker, you detain them and call the sheriff, just like you\u2019ve been doing. You\u2019re not prevented from investigating. Hell, any private investigator can do the same. You should visit the sheriff\u2019s department, Fish and Game, California Department of Forestry, the Highway Patrol and some of our neighbor towns who have their own local police departments. Introduce yourself. Believe me, they\u2019ll all appreciate any help, with all the territory they have to cover in these rural towns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you expect me to do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to worry about speeding tickets.\u201d She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out. Assess the needs of the town. It\u2019s a law-abiding place\u2014there shouldn\u2019t be too much stress. But, as has happened a couple of times too recently, if we get some real trouble, I want an experienced police officer around.\u201d She lit another cigarette. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep a jail. You shouldn\u2019t need flashing lights or a bulletproof vest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen would you expect me to be on duty?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI expect, if you\u2019re around, you\u2019re on duty. I understand everyone needs time off, needs to get out of Virgin River sometimes. If you\u2019re around five or six days a week, that\u2019s five or six more days a week than we\u2019ve had. Let\u2019s just hope our crime sprees fall on your work days.\u201d</p><p>All that came to mind was a trip to Santa Rosa for lunch every couple of weeks. Something he hoped would become even more frequent. \u201cSounds like a paid vacation,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWith any luck,\u201d she said. Then she opened the folder and showed him a one-year contract that displayed a pathetic salary.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly a paid vacation,\u201d he said. But then, he\u2019d been looking for something to do, and it wasn\u2019t necessary that he find work. He had his retirement and disability income, plus a little savings. \u201cWhy do you do this?\u201d he asked. \u201cFirst Mel, now me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, someone has to mind the needs of this town. This town is disorganized\u2014I have to think what to do about that. And we\u2019re growing, if only a little.\u201d She took a drag. \u201cI\u2019m not going to last forever, though sometimes I\u2019m afraid I might.\u201d</p><p>She slid a badge across the table to him. It said Virgin River Constable. \u201cI had that made five years ago. Nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to wear this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to keep it in your pocket until you need it? You don\u2019t have to wear a uniform or anything. You wouldn\u2019t be the only guy in town carrying a sidearm or rifle. But I recommend you generate some forms so you can write up reports when you actually do something. There ought to be records. Want me to buy you a filing cabinet?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cYeah. That would be nice. It doesn\u2019t have to be big. And business cards, please. So I can be sure anyone who might need to call me knows my number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d She smiled back at him, holding out her pen. \u201cFor now, just drive around. Sit on the porch at the bar and talk to people. Fish a little and think. Think what your job is going to be\u2014you\u2019d know more about that than me.\u201d</p><p>What a kick, he thought. The constable. Hah. For six hundred completely law-abiding citizens. \u201cI feel like Andy of Mayberry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a damn good place to start,\u201d she said, pointing the pen toward him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t take it. \u201cNot just yet,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me get the lay of the land, then we\u2019ll talk about this contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou planning to try to negotiate?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cOh, I have a feeling that would be useless. But before I make a commitment to you, to the town, I\u2019d like to find out how receptive my fellow cops are to having someone like me in the mix. Let me visit around a little. Lotta type A\u2019s in law enforcement, Hope. Some wouldn\u2019t take a rope from a guy like me if they were in quicksand. If that\u2019s going to be the case, I should just save you the time and money.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care what anyone else thinks about a guy like you.\u201d</p><p>He stood up. \u201cWell, you should. I could probably help out a little, but cops don\u2019t work alone. You might not have local police, but you don\u2019t want this new idea of yours to drive away the coverage you have. One thing at a time.\u201d</p><p>Mike borrowed Preacher\u2019s computer to fashion a pretty informal r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and letter of introduction. Because Preacher\u2019s printer wasn\u2019t top quality, he put the information on a disk and drove over to Eureka to have both printed. He chose a simple format that merely listed his experience and gave plenty of phone numbers to check references.</p> <p>If Mike had been applying for a job, he would have gone into more detail about training, awards, special assignments. In fact, he felt boastful about his accomplishments at LAPD, about his experience. He couldn\u2019t see the advantage in downplaying what he knew about law enforcement and criminal justice, but when trying to fit in with the local cops, he didn\u2019t want to appear arrogant. It was a very fine line. His goal was to become one of them, and he was curious if they would accept him. He was from the city, he was Mexican, he\u2019d been around the block. Around a lot of blocks. One thing the local guys never appreciated was some hotshot hitting town, acting as if he knew it all\u2014whether that happened in L.A. or Eureka. A lot of ex-cops were boastful, eager to play on their war stories. A lot of times their war stories were bullshit.</p><p>His first stop was the Fortuna Police Department. The chief, Chuck Andersen, was a big guy with meaty hands, bald, and he wasn\u2019t smiling. Mike got the immediate impression he reserved his smile, kept it inside so it would never appear he was playing around. Mike shook his hand and introduced himself. \u201cThanks for seeing me, Chief,\u201d he said, handing him a couple of pages. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked to take a job in Virgin River\u2014town cop, more or less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d the big guy said. He indicated a chair but didn\u2019t sit behind his desk, so Mike continued to stand. The chief looked over the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 quickly. \u201cHow long you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince just before Christmas. Couple of my best friends live in Virgin River.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you apply to one of the departments around here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for work,\u201d Mike answered. \u201cThis was a surprise. I guess the woman who put together a contract for a constable has been looking for someone, but I didn\u2019t come to Humboldt County to work. I came here to fish. Hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too many people can do that at...\u201d He looked through the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 briskly. \u201cAt thirty-seven.\u201d</p><p>Mike took a glance around the office. Family picture, good-looking wife, two handsome kids, a dog. He smiled with a little envy. \u201cI don\u2019t have a family. I was retired from LAPD with a disability.\u201d</p><p>The chief\u2019s eyes came up to Mike\u2019s face. \u201cHow\u2019d that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got shot,\u201d Mike said without self-consciousness. \u201cDuring that last assignment on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d he added with a nod toward the paperwork.</p><p>\u201cGang Unit,\u201d Andersen said. He looked as if he might have memorized the page by now. \u201cPatrol, narcotics, gangs, robbery, gangs again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI worked gangs, then after passing the sergeant\u2019s exam, was reassigned there with my own squad. I loved gangs. I hated narcotics,\u201d Mike said unnecessarily. \u201cI was always good with Patrol. Grassroots policing suited me.\u201d</p><p>Finally the chief sat, so Mike took his seat. When he did so, the chief lifted his eyes slightly, maybe surprised. \u201cMarine Corps,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Active for four, reserves for ten.\u201d Then he laughed. \u201cI got through a lot of stuff, then got picked off by a fourteen-year-old.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNo accounting for luck.\u201d As the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 described, when Mike had finished his first tour with the Marines, he\u2019d started college on the GI bill, and got his degree in criminal justice while working LAPD.</p><p>The chief read awhile. Then he lifted his eyes again. \u201cWhat\u2019s your mission here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? In your office or in Virgin River?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, my office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to say hello. I\u2019m going around to the departments. If the meter reads No Help Wanted, I\u2019m not signing that contract. If the local cops think they can stand having a guy like me helping out in Virgin River, I might go with it, see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy like you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEx-cop,\u201d he said. \u201cI know at least as many ex-cops as cops. I realize most of us come with a lot of baggage, a lot of stories. I used to get real bored with \u2019em, real tired of all the drama. And here I am\u2014one of them. With drama. With a big story.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m checking out how that goes over. It\u2019s only fair. To you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis department doesn\u2019t have any presence in Virgin River....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always the chance a problem in Virgin River could connect to your town, your department\u2014in which case I\u2019d like to think there\u2019s someone I could talk to over here.\u201d</p><p>The chief seemed to think a moment. He almost smiled. \u201cAnd the disability?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m as close to a hundred percent as a guy can get. It was mainly the shoulder,\u201d he said, working it a little bit. \u201cIt\u2019s all good. I can shoot straight, angle just fine. I\u2019ve got a left arm that\u2019s getting better all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re taking the comp, the disability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Mike said with a nod. \u201cI paid into it for fifteen years and it wasn\u2019t the first time a weapon was fired my way. I\u2019m just a working guy. But you know, I\u2019m so damn lucky\u2014the head works, the brain seems okay. I\u2019d like you to know something\u2014if I\u2019d had a chance to talk my way out of that shooting, I might have tried, but it wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d He nodded toward the paperwork. \u201cThere\u2019s a report available, if you want it. I was kind of... I was ambushed. That\u2019s all. It was a jump into a gang, and picking off the sergeant was a coup. So... That\u2019s it. I thought I\u2019d come up here and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could get a good job with a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 like this. There are lots of places\u2014private industry, corrections, small departments...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, I appreciate it. Go ahead and call some folks for references. There are lots of names on that r\u00e9sum\u00e9 there\u2014and you can get all the numbers of people not on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9. If I can help out in Virgin River, great. If it\u2019s a problem\u2014I got a lot of fish to catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much can there be to do in Virgin River?\u201d Andersen asked.</p><p>\u201cHopefully, not a lot,\u201d Mike answered. He nodded toward the pictures on the credenza. \u201cBeautiful family,\u201d he said. \u201cGood-looking dog,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s yours,\u201d the chief said. Then he smiled. \u201cThe dog.\u201d</p><p>It was Mike\u2019s turn to smile. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t give away that dog,\u201d he returned.</p><p>\u201cNah, but I might trade her for enough dirt to fill the holes in the yard. Try me.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed and stuck out his hand, which Andersen shook. \u201cThanks, Chief. Enjoyed it.\u201d He gave a nod, the chief gave a nod and Mike left.</p><p>To be met with some suspicion and reluctance was not unexpected, but it didn\u2019t make the experience very inviting. Mike was damn glad he wasn\u2019t looking for work. He had to fight himself to keep from being a little insulted; he was a decorated police officer from a big...no, huge department. But he reminded himself this was their turf. He was an interloper.</p><p>Despite the fact it was intimidating and difficult, he visited the Eureka department, the sheriff\u2019s department, Garberville police, Grace Valley, a few other small towns that had local police, sometimes just one or two cops. The initial reaction was always the same. Yeah, you\u2019re this big-shot guy? What\u2019re you doing up here, poking around? Why not go after a real job?</p><p>A few days later Chief Chuck Andersen called him. \u201cI thought you might want to spend a little time over here,\u201d he said. \u201cDo a ride along, look at a couple of things. See how it\u2019s different in a small city. Maybe give us a perspective...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be good, sir. I\u2019d like that,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cI called a couple of people at LAPD,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cYou have a pretty good reputation there.\u201d</p><p>He had an excellent reputation there. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cI was better at some things than others. I did okay in police work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cGood to have you helping out. Do a ride along with one of our guys. And Valenzuela? Bring a pillow.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cThanks, sir.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff called, then the Eureka chief. Tom Toopeek, the chief from Grace Valley, weighed in, but there were towns that never got back to him. No matter, the consensus was that he would be welcomed as a constable. By state regulation he was not an official law enforcement officer, but more or less one of the team as far as most of the local guys were concerned. He\u2019d be happy to help out anyone who asked, but what mattered was that he could go to them if there was a problem in his town. And he\u2019d be happy to have a purpose again.</p><p>He signed the contract. The first person he told about it was Brie.</p><p>Tom Booth met a girl in physics who he thought might fill the bill. Brenda. Gorgeous Brenda. Soft, shiny, light brown hair that curled under on her shoulders, blue eyes, drop-dead figure, long legs, a smile that could put him in a trance. She was more beautiful than any girl he\u2019d seen in D.C., which was some kind of miracle\u2014the D.C. girls were pretty awesome. Fortunately, she seemed almost as shy around guys as he was around girls, which could work to his advantage. He struck up a conversation with her in class and learned that she was only a junior, in accelerated math and science programs, and he thought, hot shit. Pretty, smart, nice. Yup, this was a winner.</p><p>They talked about her plans for college, his horses. He asked her if she\u2019d like to go out sometime and she said maybe. \u201cNot right now. I\u2019m kind of just getting over a really bad flu. Had me flat on my back right as school was starting and I\u2019m still on medication, so my mom is a little overprotective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we could do homework together sometime, when you start feeling better.\u201d Then he smiled his most engaging smile and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me saying so, you sure don\u2019t look sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling lots better than I did, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014maybe I could call you sometime? You feeling well enough for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cThat would be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you like to do? When you\u2019re not\u2014you know\u2014feeling bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cGames. Dances. Movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he said. \u201cThat sounds great. I\u2019ll give you a call one of these days.\u201d And he thought, maybe this isn\u2019t going to be such a boring place after all.</p><p>He called her that night. Why waste time?</p><p>Four</p><p>The fall air was crisp and refreshing and Mel, still troubled by a couple of her cases, wandered over to the bar in the afternoon as David napped in Doc\u2019s care. She found Mike sitting on the porch, feet up on the rail, his hat, his Rio Concho, pushed down on his forehead to shield his eyes from the sun, taking in a relaxing autumn day. She sat in the Adirondack chair next to him, scooted forward on the edge.</p><p>\u201cLooking for your man?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cActually, I was looking for you,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in there?\u201d she asked, giving her head a toss toward the inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPreacher and Paige are getting dinner ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He shoved his hat back, took his feet off the rail and put them on the wood planks of the porch, turning toward her. He rested his elbows on his knees and leaned forward. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You don\u2019t look too happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you something. Just how much of a cop do you intend to be around here? What if I suspected a possible problem? Could you look into it? Maybe investigate?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I have detective experience, but I\u2019m used to having a crime lab to back me up.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI used to belong to the biggest gang in L.A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGang?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLAPD. Lotta backup there. Want to lay it on me?\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cUnderstand, I can\u2019t give you names or evidence\u2014just a real strong intuitive hunch. And I\u2019ve been doing this awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p> <p>She looked into his coal-black eyes. \u201cI\u2019m worried that we have a date raper. A kid, I think. I\u2019ve had two girls who were clearly forced\u2014neither willing or able to admit it. The scenarios were different, but there were some alarming similarities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said, encouraging her to continue.</p><p>\u201cThe first came to me for emergency birth control. She said that she and her boyfriend of a whole two weeks had decided to have sex and at the last minute she lost her nerve, but he couldn\u2019t stop. She was bruised. Held down. Her vagina was ragged and torn. She was visibly upset. But she absolutely insists she was not forced.</p><p>\u201cThe second one went to a kegger somewhere around town\u2014her first drinking party, though she admits to having a beer or two before. She passed out and didn\u2019t remember having sex, but missed two periods and took a home pregnancy test and told her mother what had happened. The kids at the party were all drunk, she said, and no one remembered anything....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI explained that to her\u2014that in order to have successful intercourse, it was very likely one of them wasn\u2019t too drunk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery likely? I thought that was a law of nature,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was, too,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was obviously too late to detect damage or bruising\u2014but she said she\u2019d been very sore all over, especially on her chest.\u201d She laid her hand on her own sternum. \u201cAs if hit in the chest with a basketball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly held down as she struggled,\u201d he supplied. \u201cWhat about bruising on the inside of her thighs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t recall anything like that, but she was distracted by the fact she was real hung over and sick. The first one, however, had unmistakable finger and thumb prints on the inside of her thighs. Both tested positive for chlamydia. The pregnant one miscarried and, understandably, wants to forget the whole thing. If she can. Neither of them would give me a name or even an age of the boy or boys.\u201d</p><p>He winced visibly, inhaled deeply and rolled his eyes briefly skyward. \u201cJesus,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go anywhere with this. I don\u2019t even have grounds to report it without at least one of them relenting and saying it could have been rape. In the second case, the girl didn\u2019t remember drinking much\u2014I\u2019m wondering if there was a drug involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoofies?\u201d he asked. \u201cGHB? That could have made her really sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe woke up covered in vomit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s lucky she woke up. A side effect of GHB is a suppressed gag reflex. She could have aspirated and died,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThis really eats at me, Mike. There\u2019s nothing I can do. Well, I did do one thing\u2014I got a vaginal swab from number one, but intercourse was a couple of days old and I\u2019m sure she bathed a couple of times before coming in. Even if it turns out there\u2019s DNA present, we might never get that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut still, good thinking. Any chance you got pictures of the bruising?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have nothing. She was nearly hysterical and insisted she wasn\u2019t raped. If she had relented, even once, and said that she\u2019d been held down and forced, I would have reported it. As it stands, all I have is this big ache in my gut that tells me there\u2019s a teenage boy out there who\u2019s out of control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like it\u2019s time for me to get to know the youth of Virgin River.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew. I hoped I could dump this on you. I feel a little lighter already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014I did. I called June Hudson in Grace Valley\u2014she and her partner, John Stone, will be watching their patients for similar symptoms. And the family planning clinic in Eureka is aware of my concerns. But Mike\u2014what sickens me most is that my second girl said this happened in Virgin River.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither a teenager whose testosterone popped or a new kid in town. Worth looking at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, if any more girls come into the clinic\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll be sure to let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start looking around, talking to people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, leaning back in her chair, relieved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you about something else, Mel. I\u2019m ready to discontinue the antidepressant you prescribed after the shooting, during my recovery.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cFeeling pretty good?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cStronger, yes. I agree, it was a good idea at the time. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure. We said a few months, right? Sounds good,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s take you down slowly. I\u2019ll write up a dosage schedule for you. We\u2019ll have you off in a couple of weeks. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>John\u2014Preacher to his friends\u2014was thirty-three years old and knew a lot about war and about cooking, about hunting and fishing. He\u2019d served in the Marine Corps for twelve years and followed Jack to Virgin River, where he\u2019d turned himself into one of the best cooks in the region, if little known. But his knowledge of women was recent.</p><p>When he met and married his wife, that was when his education began. He\u2019d been a man who knew few women up to that point, and he\u2019d never considered himself much of a lover. In fact, he\u2019d been scared to death of Paige\u2014she was so petite and feminine and he was six-four, muscled, with huge, strong hands and shoulders so broad he had to turn sideways to pass through some doorways. He had been terrified that he\u2019d hurt her, leave a bruise on her.</p><p>But she had worked him through it, confident that he was the gentlest man she\u2019d ever known. In her arms he had been transformed. Now he not only understood the female body, but worshipped it. Things he hadn\u2019t known existed were now second nature to him, and his wife was his treasure, the most awesome gift he could ever have received. To make her feel wonderful was one of his greatest obsessions. He knew every erogenous spot to touch, to kiss, and the better he could make her feel, the more he enjoyed his own experience.</p><p>She was his partner by day in the bar, working beside him in the cooking and management, and his angel by night in his arms. Between them they parented her son, Christopher, now four years old, and Preacher had the kind of happiness he\u2019d thought existed only for other men. There was one small problem\u2014he and Paige wanted to have a baby together, and while they\u2019d been married only a few months, she\u2019d stopped taking her pills over six months ago and nothing had happened.</p><p>He might be disappointed, but she was beyond disappointment. She\u2019d been pregnant when she stumbled into the bar a year ago, and, as a result of a horrific beating from her then husband, had miscarried. Paige was afraid that there might be some kind of damage to her reproductive organs that would prevent her from having a baby with John\u2014and sometimes it caused her deep sadness.</p><p>At the end of every day he would clean his kitchen at the bar, turn off the Open sign and lock the door, read to Christopher after he\u2019d had his bath, then retire to the little apartment he shared with his wife, and love her. Born again in her arms, night after night.</p><p>He found her in the bathroom, wearing one of his huge T-shirts, and he caught her softly crying. It had been a very long time since he\u2019d seen her tears, and it knocked the wind out of him. He couldn\u2019t bear it. \u201cHere, here,\u201d he said, pulling her into his strong embrace. \u201cYou\u2019re crying.\u201d</p><p>She wiped the tears off her cheeks and looked up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cI got my period again. I didn\u2019t want it to come. I wanted to be pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t even late,\u201d he said, for he knew everything about her, about her body. You could set a watch by her.</p><p>\u201cNot even an hour late,\u201d she said, and a big tear spilled over.</p><p>\u201cIs it a hard one?\u201d he asked tenderly.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing at all. Except, I thought maybe finally...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s time,\u201d he said, wiping away the tear. \u201cYou should talk to Mel. Maybe to John Stone. See if we should check something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the impression that could be expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about that,\u201d he said. \u201cNever mind money\u2014this is about us being happy. We want a baby. We should do what we have to do. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you sorry? You\u2019re not in this alone. Everything is both of us. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonth after month...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now we\u2019re going to face it and ask for advice. We\u2019ll get some help. No more crying.\u201d</p><p>But she dropped her head against his chest and wept anyway, and it tore his heart out. He couldn\u2019t stand Paige to be in any kind of pain. He lived for her happiness; she was his world. His life.</p><p>\u201cAre you crying because you\u2019re PMS-y?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCramps? Want me to rub your back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her chin and kissed her deeply. Lovingly. Lustfully. \u201cWant me to make you feel a little better? I know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, John. There\u2019s no need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be shy with me. There\u2019s no part of your life, your body, that puts me off. I love every bit of you.\u201d</p><p>She sighed deeply. \u201cI should just take a shower and crawl into bed. I\u2019m feeling sorry for myself.\u201d</p><p>He reached behind her and started the water. Then he ran his hand up the back of her thigh, over her bum and under the large T-shirt she wore, caressing her back, pulling her close to kiss her some more. When he released her lips, he slowly pulled the T-shirt over her head. He loved the way she stood so erect and comfortable when she was naked in front of him, when he filled his eyes with her. He lowered his lips to her naked breast and drew gently on a nipple, causing her to let her head drop back and sigh deeply. If there was anything about his life with her that was past magnificent, it was the fact that she was as easily turned on by him as he was by her. Their love life gave her a constant glow. And he knew exactly how to make the tears go away.</p><p>He pulled the shower curtain wider for her to step inside, but then he quickly shed his clothes and got in with her. He pulled her into his arms again, his mouth on hers, his hands on her body.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d she whispered against his lips.</p><p>\u201cI never do anything I don\u2019t want to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you something happy to think about.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cBaby, I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>Mel and Jack had just finished having dinner together at the bar when Paige approached their table. \u201cMel, do you have a minute? I wanted to ask you something. Something medical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can kill two birds with one stone\u2014I have to nurse the wild one. Maybe we can go to your place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack handed over the baby. \u201cI\u2019ll take the bar,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mel didn\u2019t have a lot of occasions to be in Paige and Preacher\u2019s room behind the bar, but those few times she was, warm memories flooded back to her. This was where Jack had lived when she came to town; this was where David was no doubt conceived. She remembered the night so well\u2014she\u2019d had a major emotional meltdown, standing in the rain crying over her dead husband on the anniversary of his death, and Jack had held her. Then he\u2019d dried her off, given her a brandy, put her to bed. Sometime later he\u2019d joined her there and showed her a life and love she\u2019d never known could exist for her.</p><p>Now the room held the influence of Paige\u2014pictures of Christopher, some toys in the corner, flowers on the table. Paige had drifted into their lives almost exactly a year ago, a battered wife on the run, and with Preacher\u2019s strength behind her, had divorced her abusive husband and seen him sent to prison.</p> <p>Paige sat on the sofa and Mel took the big chair, settling David on the breast. He curled around her comfortably, gently kneading her breast with his chubby hand.</p><p>\u201cJohn wanted me to talk to you\u2014I\u2019m sorry to bother your evening, but you weren\u2019t around Doc\u2019s much the last couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. You\u2019re not bothering my evening. He\u2019s bothering my evening,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cHe\u2019s crabby tonight. Too much running around, I think. Not to mention cookies. What\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting pregnant,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s only been six months or so that I\u2019ve been off the pill, but in my previous life it was as though I couldn\u2019t keep from getting pregnant. What do you think I should do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see\u2014are your periods regular?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs clockwork,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe assumption is that you\u2019re ovulating regularly, then. Usually, if you\u2019re going to do any kind of infertility workup, you start with Dad\u2014make sure you\u2019re dealing with an adequate sperm count. It\u2019s the cheapest and quickest test, plus you don\u2019t want to do a complete workup on Mom until you rule out Dad. And after all, we know you can get pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014I could before,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cStill, there was no indication any damage was caused beyond the miscarriage,\u201d Mel said. \u201cBleeding stopped right after the D &amp; C and you haven\u2019t had any peculiarities\u2014like real heavy or weird periods, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have relations on a regular basis?\u201d</p> <p>Paige rolled her eyes. \u201cYou have to remember, John has just discovered sex,\u201d she said. Then she smiled a bit shyly.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI take that to mean\u2014?\u201d But she stopped herself.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t get enough,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then, I haven\u2019t had a loving partner until now, so I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that might be the problem. Having a lot of sex is a bad way to get pregnant. It depletes his sperm count. Before you try any fancy tests, you should drive to Fortuna, buy yourself an ovulation testing kit at the drugstore and ask Preacher to save up. It takes at least forty-eight hours to replenish the count. Make him wait. No more often than every couple of days. Every few days would be better and then only once\u2014no marathons. And you want to make sure he\u2019s been on ice a few days before the big day.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou get a reprieve on ovulation day, of course. Knock yourselves out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d she said, looking a bit stricken.</p><p>\u201cHow much do you want a baby?\u201d Mel asked. \u201cIn fact, you might not hit pay dirt that first month. You might have to keep that kind of schedule for two or three months. Just because you\u2019re both fertile doesn\u2019t mean you get pregnant on one try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boy,\u201d she said. \u201cI can just imagine how happy John\u2019s going to be to hear this. I\u2019ll have to remind him it was his idea to get your input.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you like, we can do a sperm count before you put him through all this\u2014but if it\u2019s low, the prescription is going to be wait it out, see if it gets better. On the other hand, if it\u2019s really high after all that sex, he\u2019s good to go. No reason to cut him off. Are you a betting woman?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a feeling how this is going to turn out,\u201d Paige said. \u201cHe\u2019ll want to do what matters, but...\u201d</p><p>Mel laughed in spite of herself. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s been so happy for just months now. I guess I can expect those frowns and scowls back. My advice\u2014try this for three months and then begin the infertility routine\u2014starting with sperm count. Sure you want to do this?\u201d she asked, taking the baby off the breast and putting him over her shoulder for a burp.</p><p>\u201cI want a baby, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut John was the first one to say he wanted children with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can always wait until next year,\u201d Mel said. \u201cSpend the rest of this year seeing if you can get tired of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to John,\u201d she said, noncommittal.</p><p>A few days later Mel ate a late lunch at the bar as Jack stood behind it. He filled her water glass. \u201cI want to ask you something,\u201d he said. \u201cI have absolutely no idea how you\u2019re going to answer this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds scary,\u201d she said, taking a spoonful of Preacher\u2019s delicious chicken soup into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cDepends on your perspective. Ricky\u2019s USMC graduation from basic is just around the corner and I want to go. I want us to go.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and said, \u201cOf course, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want us to go alone,\u201d he said.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI think it\u2019s important, Mel. We have to carve a little time out for the two of us, just you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling neglected?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. In fact, I feel pretty spoiled. But I still think we should make a habit of taking some time now and then, when we can be away from the town, the baby, the bar, the patients, everything. Regularly.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a seductive half smile and lifted one brow. \u201cWhy, Jack...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even about that,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, it can be about that.\u201d He grinned. Both hands braced on the bar, he leaned toward her. \u201cYou\u2019re my wife, my lover and best friend. I want you all to myself once in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do about nursing David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll manage. You pump for extra bottles anyway, and he\u2019s certainly not dependent on the breast anymore\u2014he has bottles regularly. There are lots of people who\u2019d be more than happy to keep him a couple of nights, but I thought about calling Brie. She\u2019s still not working and loves an excuse to come up here. Plus, I haven\u2019t seen her in so long. I\u2019d like to see her again\u2014just to see how she\u2019s doing. Looking. You know.\u201d He leaned forward and kissed her forehead. \u201cCome away with me, Mel. Just a couple of nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love that. I\u2019ll call Brie this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Mel left the baby napping at Doc\u2019s and drove out to her homesite. She parked and got out of the Hummer. Leaning against the hood, she watched Jack driving nails into Sheet-rock inside the frame of their house. Momentarily he stopped and came to where she stood. He opened his arms to her and she filled them. Thank God, she thought. My man is mine again. Those silent, distant days seemed to be behind them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you something,\u201d she said. \u201cBrie is coming. She\u2019s thrilled to come and babysit. She\u2019ll stay at least a week, probably two. In fact, she said there was nothing in Sacramento to demand her quick return.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him and could see the struggle in his eyes. He wanted Brie\u2014he wanted her near if she felt that it was good for her. He wanted to take care of her in any way he could, but he also wanted a private life with his wife. A private life reclaimed not all that long ago. And there was absolutely no privacy in that little cabin; every sound was shared by all.</p><p>\u201cThis is good, that she\u2019s coming,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI think she needs to get out of Sacramento for a while\u2014it\u2019ll do her good. And when we get this house finished, I think we should try to buy the cabin from Hope. It\u2019ll be a good place to have when we\u2019re bursting at our seams. You have a very large family.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cWell, Mrs. Sheridan, you\u2019re certainly throwing money around today, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWe have plenty of money. We should think about hiring subs, get this house moving. If you get bored, we\u2019ll find you something else to build.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to do it for you,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to show you how much I would do, how far I would go. How hard I would work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly think I don\u2019t already know all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not serious,\u201d Preacher said to Paige. \u201cThat can\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Mel says,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWow. Who\u2019d ever think that the way to get pregnant is by not having sex.\u201d It seemed as though he might\u2019ve hung his head.</p><p>\u201cJohn, it\u2019s up to you. We don\u2019t have to do this. Right now, anyway. I\u2019m not insisting...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll do it. We want a baby. I want a baby as much as you do and getting your period makes you cry. So we\u2019ll do it.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHow\u2019m I gonna know when it\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014a few days between. You know? And just once, John, on those days. Except on ovulation day.\u201d She grinned at him. \u201cYou can go crazy on ovulation day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I\u2019m going to miss it,\u201d he moaned.</p><p>\u201cJohn, I don\u2019t have any facts to support this, but I don\u2019t think everyone is having as much sex as we are....\u201d</p><p>He had a confused look on his face. \u201cWell, why not?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cOh, John...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get your little thing? Your little ovulation thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to run over to Fortuna later for some supplies for the bar and I\u2019ll pick up a couple of kits, exactly the kind we need, because Mel said it could take longer than just a couple of months for us to make this work\u2014if that\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than a couple of months?\u201d he asked weakly.</p><p>Don\u2019t laugh, don\u2019t laugh, Paige was saying to herself. \u201cWe try this for two or three months,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work by then, we\u2019ll get you tested, maybe try something else.\u201d</p><p>He put his head in his hand. \u201cWow,\u201d he said. Then, lifting his head bravely, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We can do it.\u201d</p><p>She put a hand on his arm. \u201cJohn, ovulation day is just around the corner. A couple of weeks. That\u2019s your reward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you, Paige. I\u2019m going to make it your reward. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Oh my, she thought. This was going to be interesting.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have to get a sitter for Christopher and close the bar on ovulation day,\u201d he said.</p><p>Before Mel and Jack could leave for Ricky\u2019s graduation from basic training, a newcomer appeared in Virgin River. The lunch crowd had cleared out and Jack was behind the bar when a young woman came in. She had reddish-blond hair and that golden complexion that suggested freckles. Her lips were peach colored and she was smiling so brightly that Jack tilted his head, returning the smile, wondering who this might be. She came right up to the bar and leaned on it. \u201cJack Sheridan?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>She put out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Vanessa Rutledge. Matt Rutledge\u2019s wife. We have some people in common.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grabbed her hand. \u201cYou bet we do, one being your husband. How\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back in the Middle East, I\u2019m afraid. He\u2019s been gone a few months. I\u2019m staying with my dad while he\u2019s there, but Matt told me I\u2019d better come here right away, look you up, find out when your boys are coming around, because Matt\u2019s best friend and our best man is Paul Haggerty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI remember, now that you mention it. I had those two boys in my squad way back\u2014they were just kids. Paul, Matt, Preacher, Mike Valenzuela. Then Paul and the others were in my platoon on my last assignment in Iraq, and we\u2019re still tight. Paul was here not very long ago, and due back again soon. We always try to catch some of hunting season, however many can make it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPaul and Matt went to school together,\u201d she said. \u201cThey enlisted together, went into basic and served a couple of tours together. In fact, they were together the night I met my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Preacher and Mike are going to love this,\u201d Jack said. He turned away from her and hit the wall that separated the bar from the kitchen to bring Preacher out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard all about Preacher,\u201d she said. \u201cPaul talked about you guys and this little bar a lot. It was such a weird coincidence that my dad found this place to settle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe bought an old ranch on the edge of town a couple of years ago, right before his last assignment. He was having some work done to renovate it before he retired, then brought my little brother and their horses out here from D.C. over summer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLast assignment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe retired from the Army. Major General Walter Booth.\u201d</p><p>Amused surprise registered on Jack\u2019s face. \u201cA grunt general let his daughter marry an enlisted jarhead?\u201d</p><p>She lifted one pretty eyebrow, aquamarine eyes sparkling, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t take orders from anyone.\u201d And they both laughed.</p><p>Preacher came out of the back, frowning at having been summoned by the pounding. He met with the gleaming smile of the pretty redhead at the bar and he softened his expression somewhat, curiously.</p><p>Vanessa was not startled by the big man\u2019s size or surly expression. Neither was she surprised when his features softened into a curious smile. \u201cYou must be Preacher,\u201d she said. She put out a hand. \u201cI\u2019d know you anywhere, except I heard you were big and bald. Now you\u2019re just big. Vanessa Rutledge\u2014Matt Rutledge\u2019s wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Preacher exclaimed, reaching for her hand. \u201cI heard he got married. What\u2019s he doing these days?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and made a half smile. \u201cGuess. Iraq. Baghdad, last I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, kid,\u201d Preacher said sympathetically. \u201cAnd you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad just moved here\u2014he\u2019s out on the edge of town. A nice place for him and his horses. And my little brother, Tommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. Right here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe world just gets smaller,\u201d she said, stepping back from the bar and pulling open her jacket to reveal a pregnant tummy. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to see Jack\u2019s wife. I\u2019m going to need her services.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Jack said. \u201cLook at you. First?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Just a few months to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs Matt going to get back for the baby?\u201d Jack asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo, but if we time this right, he should get a nice long leave when the baby\u2019s a couple of months old.\u201d She looked around, taking in the bar, the animal trophies on the walls, the rich dark wood. \u201cSo this is the place, huh? Boy, I\u2019ve sure heard a lot about this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boys love this place,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWhen Matt\u2019s out, we\u2019ll make sure he gets up here with the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he\u2019s out? Hah! You think that\u2019s going to happen? Matt\u2019s a career Marine.\u201d But she smiled, clearly proud of her man. And being a general\u2019s daughter, she would be more than familiar with the rigors of military life.</p><p>\u201cNo rush,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be around a long time.\u201d</p><p>Paige was summoned to the bar to meet Vanessa. Before long Mike made an appearance and was delighted to make the acquaintance of Matt\u2019s wife. An invitation was extended for the general to stop by the bar for one on the house and Jack promised to get in touch with Vanessa and her father before Paul joined the next Semper Fi gathering, coming up soon.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t tell Paul we\u2019re here,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cI\u2019d love to surprise him.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>Mike Valenzuela became aware that beneath the surface of a perfect small town there could be crime, some minor and predictable, some of an insidious nature. He thought often about the two patients Mel had presented as he visited casually with neighbors, with the high school in the next town attended by the Virgin River kids, asking what people did for fun around these parts. Most of the time he got the expected responses\u2014adults had their own gatherings, parties, picnics, cookouts. They frequented restaurants, galleries, wineries and nightspots in and around the coastal towns, and of course just about everyone hunted and fished. Most of the community socializing surrounded school functions, from sporting events to band and choir activities, after which there would always be big gatherings among the parents.</p><p>Zach Hadley dropped by Jack\u2019s once or twice a week for a beer and Mike took the opportunity to get to know him a little better\u2014his link to the high school kids paid off almost right away. He said the teens had their school functions from games to dances, but they also had a few haunts. Parties, both with parents home and away, keggers in the woods. He\u2019d overheard some talk about an isolated old rest stop back off highway 109 where there were a few ancient barbecue pits, bathrooms and picnic tables. Highway 109 had been heavily traveled before the newer freeway was finished and now was more of a daytime road, left to the teens by night. A perfect place, when the weather allowed, to bring a keg or a case of beer. Where Mike grew up in L.A. the kids had desert keggers or beach keggers\u2014but out here, they had the forest.</p><p>\u201cAs long as they don\u2019t get way back in the woods, far from the towns, they\u2019re probably safe from problems with wildlife or marijuana growers,\u201d Mike said. But were they safe from each other? Mike wondered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, then?\u201d Zach asked. \u201cAll that illegal growing they talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Mike confirmed. \u201cListen, if you ever have any concerns that I can help with, I wouldn\u2019t let on where I got the information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d he said, keeping his voice low, \u201cI happened to see something\u2014a half-written note\u2014that startled me. Got my attention\u2014but I wouldn\u2019t have the first idea where to go with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your first idea,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just gossip, you know. Sometimes things kids that age say can be shocking\u2014and entirely fictional. But the note said something like stay away from those parties. There was a rumor about a girl ending up pregnant, though she couldn\u2019t remember having sex.\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cHow\u2019d you come across that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA student left a notebook in class.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI looked through it.\u201d</p><p>Mike smiled. \u201cI like your style. Nosy. Whose notebook was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. I left it where I found it and it disappeared after lunch. Never saw it again, and I watched the kids, checked out what they were carrying into class. It belonged to a girl, I can tell you that. The doodles were all female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep an eye on that, huh? Listen carefully,\u201d Mike suggested. \u201cThat could be important information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know kids are going to drink some beer,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut if there\u2019s any truth there, that\u2019s some real hard drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mike said. And he thought\u2014I bet it wasn\u2019t the beer. \u201cKeep me posted. I\u2019ll never let on that we talked.\u201d</p><p>Mike hung around the school, introducing himself, trying to cozy up to the kids, being as friendly and cool as possible. He knew he\u2019d find some pot as he looked deeper. There was whispering of some methamphetamine, but no one breathed a word of roofies. Having Zach on his team was a big plus, but he was hoping to nab himself a teenage confidential informant, a CI who would feed him some names. The local police and sheriff\u2019s department would already be looking into any underage drinking or illegal drug use when it turned up. But he wanted to know if any of his Virgin River girls were getting raped, and unless someone had filed a police report, local law enforcement wouldn\u2019t know about it. And he already considered them his girls, his town.</p><p>He took a swing by the rest stop on 109 and found some beer bottles and condoms in the trash. He decided he might visit this spot with regularity, see who turned up. What turned up. He might even try a little woodsy surveillance. But winter came early in the mountains and he suspected that his window of opportunity was nearly closed for the season.</p><p>There was only one new guy on the block, as far as Mike could determine\u2014seventeen-year-old Tom Booth, Vanessa\u2019s younger brother, the general\u2019s son. Tom hadn\u2019t been in town very long, not long enough to effect any damage. Booth, who invited Mike to call him Walt, was a widower and introduced him to Tommy, who seemed bright and affable. Polite and sincere. He would probably be popular with the girls, but he didn\u2019t know many people yet. If Tom were well acquainted at school, he\u2019d make a good source, but that wasn\u2019t the case. When Mel\u2019s second patient had awakened pregnant after a party, Tom had still been back in D.C.</p><p>And then there was a host of boys who had passed the age of fifteen, sixteen, seventeen\u2014and perhaps come into some serious hormonal brain damage. A little testosterone and a lack of values could do the trick.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the one person he wished he could talk to about this was Brie. But if he was any judge, she wasn\u2019t up to that conversation. It was still too close to her own violation.</p><p>Mike didn\u2019t expect to find himself back at the sheriff\u2019s department quite so soon, but he felt compelled to let him know what he was sniffing around for. Since he had no victim, no suspect, no evidence, he really expected the sheriff to thank him politely and ask Mike to keep him informed. To his surprise, the sheriff called a detective named Delaney into his office and introduced him as their representative to a multi-agency drug task force, comprised of law enforcement from each local, state and county agency. \u201cWe have a detective working sexual assault, but it sounds like that would be getting ahead of ourselves. I\u2019ll check with him, though. Ask if he\u2019s heard anything about this,\u201d the sheriff said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Mike answered. \u201cI understand this is big marijuana country,\u201d he said to Detective Delaney.</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot of that, yeah. But we have a growing problem with white dope and really want to get ahead of that,\u201d he said. White dope would be meth, cocaine, heroine.</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d Mike said. \u201cHeard any rumblings about ecstasy? Roofies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEcstasy, though rare. Roofies\u2014no. But Jesus, if you chase that down...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll keep us up to speed?\u201d the sheriff interrupted.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this reluctance on the part of possible victims to report this, it could be a long process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven more reason I\u2019m glad you\u2019re willing to look further,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cWithout a victim or charge, no way I could free up a deputy to look into this. I appreciate the help.\u201d He stuck out his hand. \u201cThat little town upriver is lucky to have you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Mike said. What he didn\u2019t say was that in this case his motivation went a bit deeper than simply finding a bad guy. This was hitting a little close to home. There was Brie... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The next day he drove to Eureka and bought a laptop and printer. It was time to get online, use the Internet and his contacts for research.</p><p>When Brie arrived in Virgin River she had a couple of days with Jack, Mel and the baby before her brother and sister-in-law got off to an early start on the third day, headed for San Diego to the graduation. Then she changed the linens on the bigger bed in the room next to David\u2019s and looked forward to a peaceful couple of days in the cabin. She bathed and fed her nephew, read while he had his morning nap, then took him into town at about lunchtime.</p><p>David was a baby used to being taken everywhere. While his mother and father worked he was either at Doc\u2019s clinic or at the bar, being looked after by a variety of people. He was a flexible baby, but because of the hectic schedule his parents kept, easily bored. Sitting around at home wouldn\u2019t do it for him. So Brie went visiting.</p> <p>She spent some time with Paige, hearing about the new quest to make a baby. She had lunch at the bar and David had finger food from the tray in his stroller. She spent a little time at Doc\u2019s, where they played gin while David had his afternoon nap. She visited with Connie at the corner store and watched the afternoon soap opera with Connie and Joy, finding the starring hussie was doing yet another guy on the air, much to the delight of the older women. It was nearly dinnertime by the time she got back to Jack\u2019s and people started wandering in. Brie had herself a beer while Preacher warmed up some finger veggies for David and a little skim milk for his special cup with the spout. Everyone who came into the bar gave her a friendly hello but then went immediately to David to kiss him, snuggle him, nuzzle him, make faces at him and entertain him. This was one of the most loved residents of Virgin River, and if it was not because he was charming and handsome, then it was because he belonged to Mel and Jack.</p><p>By five, Mike came in, and of course he went immediately to Brie. He had a beer while she finished hers and then they had their dinner together. He talked a little about driving around to the surrounding towns, trying to get to know people, learning how they spent their time and whether they had any concerns with which he could assist. He was beginning to get a sense of what they needed in a community policeman and found it to be like having any neighborhood beat in a city. It was not long after dinner that David began to fuss, needing that bedtime change and bottle.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she said, getting up and taking the baby\u2019s stroller in hand.</p><p>He stood, as well. \u201cWould you like some company tonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I think I\u2019m going to concentrate on my job.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWhen Mom and Dad get back, maybe we could do something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find something fun,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cIt might not be too early to see the whales\u2014they should be migrating south pretty soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should try that,\u201d she said.</p><p>When Brie took David home, the first thing that struck her was that it was very dark. She hadn\u2019t left any lights on at the cabin and although it was only about seven, the night was quickly descending. The towering trees that surrounded the clearing cast long shadows. This place had always given her such a sense of peace and safety, it surprised her to be set on edge like this. She tried to ignore the anxiety it created in her and talked to the baby, as if he were company enough. \u201cCome on, buster. Let\u2019s get you settled. You had a good day, didn\u2019t you? Yes, you did.\u201d</p><p>Then there was that matter of the door having been left unlocked; she felt her heart skip a few beats. But she went inside, flipped on lights and locked the front door. She went to the back door and locked it. Her first two nights there had been so restful and tranquil, it had never occurred to her she\u2019d be nervous tonight. Then, despite the fact that David fussed unhappily, she put him in his bed and retrieved her 9 mm handgun from her purse. Gun in hand, she searched the cabin, anxious to put her mind at ease. Inside closets, under beds, up in the loft. It didn\u2019t take long to find it empty of threats, thank goodness, because her nephew was getting loud and impatient in his crib. She put the gun on the nightstand beside her bed and tended to his needs. She changed him and warmed the breast milk that had been left for her by Mel.</p><p>It bothered her that there were no blinds or shutters to close over the windows. But why would Mel and Jack have bothered, out here in the forest? Who was to peek in the windows besides a bear? This hadn\u2019t bothered her last night or the night before. Still, it caused Brie to fidget and continually glance around at the uncovered windows. Then she realized she had not spent a night alone since June.</p><p>\u201cYou have to do it sometime. You have to get beyond this,\u201d she said aloud to herself.</p> <p>Once David was changed, fed and put in his crib, she couldn\u2019t imagine what she was going to do with herself, sitting in the little living room of that cabin, feeling as if anyone could look in, the TV fuzzy because Mel and Jack had never bothered to get a satellite dish. So she turned off the lights, and in the dark she undressed for bed. She put on a lightweight but concealing sweat suit, remembering with some longing the days when she\u2019d slept in the buff, confident and unafraid. She hadn\u2019t slept in the nude since that night. Even though it wasn\u2019t yet eight o\u2019clock, she got into bed. Her heart was beating too fast and she talked to herself\u2014there\u2019s no one out here who wants to hurt you. You\u2019re isolated in the woods\u2014no one even knows you\u2019re here.</p><p>Brie lay on her back, her arms folded across her stomach, her gun on the bedside table. She forced her eyes closed for a minute, then two minutes, then longer if she could. It seemed forever before her pulse slowed and she relaxed a little; every sound the wind made caused her to tremble. If I can just make it through one night, I can make it through another, she told herself. She looked at the bedside clock at eight-fifteen, eight-thirty, eight forty-five.</p><p>At some point she dozed off, but later she was jolted awake by a fright. She gasped, sat straight up in the bed and realized she was sweating, panting, her heart hammering. She grabbed up the gun and held it out in front of her, pointing it toward the bedroom door. She listened intently. There was a whistling and soft moaning; the wind through the pines. There was a slight muffled sound coming from David\u2019s bedroom and she got out of bed, gun in hand, muzzle pointed to the ceiling, and crept into his bedroom to be sure there was no one there. David squirmed around in his sleep, nestling into the bedding, dreaming.</p><p>Oh, God, she thought. I\u2019m creeping around my baby nephew with a loaded gun! Tears stung her eyes. I\u2019m a basket case, she thought.</p><p>She went into the dark kitchen, picked up the phone and called Mike. When he answered, she said in a breath, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d he asked, alert.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Nothing that I know of. The doors are locked, I\u2019ve checked the house, but I\u2019m prowling around here with a loaded gun in my hand. I\u2019m completely nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you put that gun down, please,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cI will be there in ten minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she answered tremulously, feeling that she had somehow failed. Failed her brother and Mel, failed herself.</p><p>\u201cPlease, put it aside, and I will come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said again. But she didn\u2019t put it aside. She slipped down onto the kitchen floor and sat there against the cabinets in the corner, from where she could see the rest of the kitchen. If anyone came at her, she could shoot him. And then she thought, my God, it\u2019s a good thing David can\u2019t walk! Right now she would shoot anything that moved; she was wired enough to shoot at nothing and a ricocheted bullet could hurt or even kill the baby! She tried to keep her finger relaxed along the barrel and away from the trigger, repeating in her mind, do not act unless you\u2019re sure. Do not.</p><p>Ten minutes is an eternity when you\u2019re afraid. And there is nothing worse than fear, whether or not there is an object. There was a metallic taste in her mouth from the adrenaline and her pulse beat dangerously fast. Finally, after what seemed like an hour, her knuckles white from holding the grip so fiercely, she heard the sound of an engine as a car came into the clearing, then a small toot as he honked the horn to let her know it was him.</p><p>She pulled herself to her feet, put the gun on the kitchen counter and unlocked the front door. When she opened it, she saw him standing there in a heavy suede jacket, wearing a sidearm. It somehow made her feel better, him having that gun. It was as though he had taken her seriously. As if her fear, though unfounded, could have had some basis.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she said, falling against him gratefully. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of nothing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it easy,\u201d he said, gently touching her back. He held her a bit, very careful not to hold her too tightly. \u201cThese things take time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t. It\u2019s so understandable as to be almost predictable.\u201d He pulled back from her, his hands on her upper arms. \u201cYour first night alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t see this coming. I\u2019ve felt so great since I got here. I\u2019ve never slept better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to check the house for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though I\u2019ve checked it,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cAnd maybe outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to. Sit down. Take a few deep breaths and try to relax.\u201d</p><p>He saw the gun on the counter and touched the grip. It was still warm. She\u2019d been so afraid, she hadn\u2019t been able to put it down.</p><p>He walked around the house and up into the loft, turning lights on and off as he went. He took a flashlight from his car to check the grounds outside, where he found everything to be undisturbed\u2014no footprints or mashed grass or shrubs. When he went back into the house, he locked the door behind him, took off his sidearm and holster and put it on the counter next to her gun. He took off his jacket and draped it over a kitchen chair. Then he went to the tiny living room, where he crouched in front of the cold hearth. He stacked a few logs over some starter pine cones, lit them and watched the flames rise. He rubbed his hands together in front of the fire, then went to sit on the sofa beside her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said meekly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Brie. You should feel safe so you can take good care of David. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I called you out in the middle of the night. You must be so annoyed.\u201d</p><p>He grinned handsomely. \u201cBrie. It isn\u2019t even ten o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! I didn\u2019t even sleep an hour!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and, leaning over to pull off his boots, said, \u201cYou\u2019ll get a good night\u2019s sleep now. I\u2019m staying the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a good idea....\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, mija. Don\u2019t I know everything you\u2019re going through trying to get your life back? You can\u2019t honestly think I\u2019d do one thing to make you feel threatened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t insult me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of unforgivable things, it\u2019s true, but I\u2019ve never been unkind to a woman. I am a gentleman. And you need sleep.\u201d</p><p>She thought about it for less than a second. \u201cI know if you go, I\u2019ll crack up. For God\u2019s sake, when does it end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I know it does. It turns out this is just a little too soon for you. There\u2019s no need for you to feel self-conscious about this. We just won\u2019t mention it. No one watches my comings and goings. No one watches this cabin to see whose car is parked outside.\u201d</p><p>She gave a sigh and leaned back into the couch cushions. \u201cI hate what this has done to me. I thought I was tougher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, don\u2019t do that to yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough what\u2019s been done to you without adding that. It\u2019s not a small thing to get over, Brie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She drew her feet up, massaging her temples with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cHeadache?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cJust a little tension,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll pass.\u201d Then she laughed a little. \u201cI was looking forward to coming back here for some fun. Before this happened to me, I\u2019d been planning all the many ways I could break your heart.\u201d</p> <p>He cocked his head and smiled at her. \u201cHad you, now? That sounds interesting. Now I have something to look forward to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking you\u2019d be devastated. Wiped out,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cAh. Are you willing to share any details?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already devastated.\u201d He stood up and went into the kitchen, dug around in the refrigerator and came out with two bottles of beer. He popped the tops and handed her one, keeping one for himself, and took his corner of the couch again. He hoped it didn\u2019t show on his face that just looking at her in the dim firelight was a treat, a delight. Her hair all mussed from bed, her feet bare, her cheeks pinked up from anxiety, she almost took his breath away. He knew she was skittish around men to the point that she couldn\u2019t even go to a coed gym to work out, and he didn\u2019t delude himself that he was exempt from that category, not even after all the time they\u2019d had together. Oh, perhaps at the moment, as they shared a couch with a couple of feet separating them. But if he tried to get too close right now, she would freak. Bolt. Melt down.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you should think about going back to work,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, but I\u2019ve lost interest in prosecuting felons. I haven\u2019t lost interest in the law, but I don\u2019t know in what field. My experience is all criminal, and I just don\u2019t feel like going back into any kind of criminal law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about working with rape victims?\u201d</p><p>She sighed deeply. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to be a rape victim anymore. I\u2019m trying to move on from that, even though I realize some of it will be with me forever.\u201d She shook her head and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been prepping rape victims for years, and now I am one. I just don\u2019t want to stay in that cycle. God, I want to move past that if I can!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s reasonable. Maybe there\u2019s some way you can use your prosecutorial expertise on the defense side.\u201d</p><p>Her expression was shocked. \u201cI can never defend a criminal against prosecution. Especially now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere has to be something,\u201d he said. \u201cHuman rights? Discrimination cases? EEOC? Women\u2019s rights? ACLU?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re used to having a mission, some injustice that needs you. You\u2019ve always worked hard. I\u2019m not sure all this time to think is such a good thing.\u201d</p><p>She stretched out her legs and put her feet on the coffee table to warm them from the glowing fire, and he put his up as well, not touching. And she found herself wondering, not for the first time, if all the women he had so greatly wronged had been his friend like this at first. Had he spent long hours, months, talking to them in sensitive, nonthreatening ways before having sex with them, marrying them and then betraying them? It would have taken such a lot of time. Such an investment. She further wondered if she could be tricked the way they were. She took a pull on her beer.</p><p>\u201cAfter Mel and Jack return, if you\u2019re not in a hurry to get back to Sacramento, how about if we take a day and go over to the coast. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll catch the whales, but there\u2019s a lot of stuff over there. Art galleries, wine-tasting rooms, trails to the headlands and beach, nice restaurants. We could just be tourists for a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be thinking of that as a...date?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI would,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>A smile tilted her lips. \u201cI could do that,\u201d she said. \u201cWere you good friends with your wives before you married them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t really answer any more questions about that. About them,\u201d he said.</p><p>She sat up a little. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could give you an unfair advantage in staging my heartbreak. I want to level the playing field.\u201d</p><p>It made her laugh. Or the beer made her laugh. But this was one of the things that was working on her\u2014he didn\u2019t take her too seriously, and yet he took her very seriously. And she trusted him, which both reassured and worried her. She pulled her feet back, tucking them under her, and turned toward him. \u201cWere you?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cNah. I told you\u2014I was always hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to the story,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot very much more,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out some things,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rape\u2014that\u2019s not hard. Impossible to believe, but completely understandable. It was revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn ambush,\u201d he supplied.</p><p>\u201cAmbush,\u201d she repeated thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happened to me,\u201d he added. \u201cThe one thing you really can\u2019t protect yourself against.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, leaning back. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the hardest part of the equation for me to reason out\u2014that there wasn\u2019t really anything I could have done differently. Or smarter. Have you struggled with that?\u201d</p><p>She thought for a moment, holding her bottom lip between her teeth. \u201cI\u2019ve struggled with every part of that. But the thing that still gnaws at me is how I screwed up with Brad. For some reason, since the rape, it\u2019s like the pain of the divorce is fresh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think you screwed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea he was the kind of man who could do what he did. I never saw it coming. I\u2019ve thought back to the beginning\u2014to the first date. To every day of the marriage. Maybe I worked too hard\u2014my hours were so long. I could have paid closer attention. Maybe my commitment to my career was stronger than my commitment to Brad. I never\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mike took his feet off the trunk, planted them on the floor and said, \u201cBrie, it might\u2019ve been his screwup, not yours. When I met you for the first time, years ago, what I saw shining in your eyes was trust and commitment. And love. God, you were so in love with him. And on top of that you were a brilliant achiever, a woman of strength and power and courage. And you couldn\u2019t get close enough to him, giving him all your attention. If that wasn\u2019t enough for Brad, you can\u2019t blame yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about them. Tell me why you married them, why your marriages failed.\u201d</p><p>He cautiously reached out a hand to gently touch her hair. \u201cHoney, it\u2019s not that interesting. It won\u2019t help you understand Brad. The only thing I have in common with Brad is we were both idiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she demanded softly.</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cCarmel was nineteen years old when she went to work for my father as a novice bookkeeper and secretary, and we met while I was on leave. We wrote letters\u2014lonely, sweet letters that became more romantic. Six months later when I was again on leave, we made love, and after that she needed to be married. So that\u2019s what we did\u2014married, and then I was sent to Iraq. When I came home, she was ready to move on. She broke my heart and saved my life all at the same time, because I wouldn\u2019t have left her, and I would have continued to be a terrible husband to her. I lived in the moment. I was too easily distracted. Always thinking of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the next one?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWe married out of guilt. She was with another man when I began to see her and she broke it off with him to be with me. That was her choice\u2014I didn\u2019t ask her to do that. But like Carmel, she needed to be married after that. Maybe neither of us could handle what we\u2019d done\u2014I have some pretty large Catholic guilt. So we married. We tried to turn a sexual fling into true love and it didn\u2019t work. Within six months she was gone. It was a mistake from the beginning, but I didn\u2019t learn my lesson about that kind of thing for quite a while. If a woman was warm and willing... I was still living in the moment, thinking of myself. There\u2019s no defense for what I did to either of them, but I was only twenty-six years old when my second marriage was over and still a young fool.</p><p>\u201cAnd the other thing was, I didn\u2019t take marriage seriously. I thought I\u2019d just find a wife automatically. I\u2019d just aim, fire and bang\u2014I\u2019d be married and have a bunch of kids.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s what my brothers did. And my sisters. They dated someone, married \u2019em, the rest is history. They\u2019re all happy. It never occurred to me they knew what they were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly. Thank God that didn\u2019t happen. I\u2019d hate to have kids caught up in my miscalculations. Before the shooting, I had no patience, hardly any scruples. I might\u2019ve hit on you four years ago if you hadn\u2019t been obviously in love with your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about that shooting changed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? I almost died. I had a lot of time\u2014down time\u2014to think about how I\u2019d misspent my life. About all the people I must have disappointed\u2014not the least of whom was myself. I wasn\u2019t unlike Brad\u2014the kind of guy who\u2019d take too many chances, risk things a person with a brain would never risk. And it cost him everything. Cost me everything.\u201d He took a drink from his beer. \u201cMy ex-wives\u2014they might not have been perfect, but I can\u2019t blame anyone but myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d she said, sitting straighter. \u201cYour heart has to be broken!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m sure it will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what I can\u2019t get past,\u201d she said, \u201cis what if I face that again? What if I\u2019m in love with some man, want to have a life with him and it seems everything is okay. Wonderful. Perfect. And then...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Brie, there aren\u2019t any guarantees in this life\u2014you know that better than anyone. After you take your time, know as much about him as you can and use your best judgment, it might be you who has a change of heart.\u201d His dark eyes glowed in the firelight. \u201cOr maybe you\u2019re right about everything\u2014about your feelings and his\u2014and it\u2019s destined to last forever, to be perfect forever, and something you couldn\u2019t have foreseen happens. He slips off the mountain or falls off a boat.\u201d He touched her nose. \u201cIf you find yourself in that wonderful temptation, believing in someone enough to take that kind of chance, the person you\u2019ll have to trust most is yourself.\u201d</p><p>They talked until almost midnight and Brie began to yawn. And yawn and yawn. Finally Mike said, \u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy. Go to bed. I\u2019ll be right here on the couch. I\u2019ll hear every sound, so you can just fall asleep and leave me in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. First of all, this is a solid cabin\u2014all locked up tight. Second, if anything stirs, I\u2019m up like that,\u201d he said, snapping his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a choice. It comes from years of nodding off while sitting surveillance. And that\u2019s nothing to how light a sleeper you become in Iraq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I could buy that. It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. I haven\u2019t lied to you yet.\u201d</p><p>She thought about all the things he\u2019d told her about himself\u2014totally uncomplimentary things guaranteed to keep her from getting further involved with him, and decided that he hadn\u2019t lied to her. \u201cOkay, then,\u201d she said, standing. \u201cThanks. I mean it, really. Thanks. I don\u2019t think I can do it yet\u2014alone. You want a pillow or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Brie went off to bed. He heard the sound of her brushing her teeth. Moving around. Snuggling in. He lay down on the sofa; his legs were too long and he propped them up on the arm. His feet would be asleep before morning, but it was okay. He wanted to do this for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not much time had passed when he opened his eyes to find her standing over him. \u201cUmm,\u201d she said nervously. \u201cCan you...? This is awkward. I\u2019m still very squeamish about a man even seeing me on the treadmill, but could you share the bed, in your clothes, and manage not to do anything? I mean, even in your sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay right here, Brie. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about... I just thought, that couch isn\u2019t big enough. And there\u2019s a bed in the loft, but I just don\u2019t want you way up there. And I... Could you lie beside me on the bed without\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to try anything with you, Brie. I know you can\u2019t handle that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can sleep unless you\u2019re...closer,\u201d she said very softly.</p><p>\u201cAw, honey...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come on,\u201d she said, turning back to the bedroom.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move for a moment, thinking. It didn\u2019t take long. He wanted to be next to her, but he didn\u2019t have to be. But if she needed him, he was there. He stood and got rid of his belt because of the big buckle, but everything else stayed on. And he went to the bedroom.</p> <p>She was curled up under the covers, her back facing out, leaving him room. So he lay down on the bed on top of the covers, giving her that security. \u201cOkay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a big bed, just a double, and it was impossible to keep a lot of space between them. He curved around her back, spooning her, his face against her hair, his wrist resting over her hip. \u201cOkay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He nestled in, his cheek against the fragrant silkiness of all that loose hair, his body wrapped around hers, though separated by layers of clothes and quilts, and it was a long, long time before he found sleep. By her even breathing, Mike knew she rested comfortably and that made him feel good.</p><p>When he woke in the morning, she had turned in her sleep and lay in the crook of his arm, snuggled up close to him, her lips parted slightly, her breath soft and warm against his cheek. And he thought, Oh damn, she\u2019s right\u2014this is going to just break the hell out of my heart.</p> <p>Jack and Mel drove to Eureka and picked up a couple of connecting flights to San Diego, arriving a night before Rick\u2019s graduation. That gave them a little time alone together at a nice hotel. They had a swim, something they never did in Virgin River. Then a nice dinner and a long, wonderful night as man and wife. That first night away they managed to concentrate only on each other, but first thing the next morning Mel called Brie to make sure the baby was all right.</p><p>\u201cI miss him so much,\u201d she complained.</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d Jack said. \u201cSo do I. Thank you for doing this for me,\u201d he said, pulling her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just for you. It was for me, too. But I miss him so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust two nights, baby. Then we\u2019ll be home. And we won\u2019t leave him again for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Watching Rick stand at attention while being inducted into the Marine Corps sent pride spiraling through Jack\u2019s breast. He graduated at the top of his class, a young leader, a powerfully strong and smart young man. When the company was dismissed by the commanding officer, the young Marines all took a step back, did an about-face and shouted, \u201cAye, sir!\u201d Mel grabbed Jack\u2019s arm, leaned against him, moved to tears. Out on the field it was handshakes and hugs, the young men thanking the drill sergeant, big grins and laughter. Jack put an arm around her and held her close. They stood at the edge of the field and waited for Rick to find them.</p><p>When he did, Jack grabbed Rick\u2019s hand in a firm clutch that brought them chest to chest, \u201cHoo-rah, man,\u201d Jack said. \u201cGood job. I\u2019m proud of you, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, buddy.\u201d But Mel just leaned against him, hugged him and cried. \u201cHey, Mel,\u201d he said, laughing, patting her back. \u201cEasy does it, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Ricky, you are so handsome. Look at you. You\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere are some options, Rick. We can get your things,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of rooms, not barracks. We can have a nice dinner out and catch our flights early tomorrow morning. Or maybe you have some plans with your boys before you check out of here and I can get you in the morning, take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had about enough of these boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has to be some stuff going on tonight. To celebrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure. But I\u2019m just ready to get off the base. I like your first idea.\u201d</p><p>Jack suspected some of the young Marines would be getting hotel rooms as well, but they\u2019d be wanting to get drunk and find girls. After what Rick had been through last year with his girl, he was probably less than interested. So Jack checked them in, took them out to a nice steak dinner and heard all the stories about basic. After dinner he tucked Mel into bed and went to Rick\u2019s room with a cold six-pack. He tapped on the door and was admitted by a freshly showered kid in sweatpants, bare chested. \u201cHey, you\u2019re my best friend,\u201d Rick said, spying the beer.</p><p>Jack was somewhat taken by the boy\u2019s physique, which had been honed by basic training. He\u2019d been strong and lean when he went in, but now he was cut and powerful looking. His beard was getting heavy; the hair on his chest had grown thick. Jack laughed and shook his head. \u201cDamn it, boy. You sure don\u2019t look eighteen anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel eighteen, either. I feel about a hundred and ten.\u201d He took a bottle of beer and touched the neck to the one Jack held. \u201cThanks for coming down, Jack. It meant a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeant a lot more to me,\u201d Jack said. Jack sat on one of the chairs by a small table in the room while Rick sat on the edge of his bed. \u201cSome of the boys are coming up next week to catch a little of deer season. We\u2019d like you to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great. There are a couple of things I have to do first,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to spend a little time with my grandma. And I have to drive over to Eureka,\u201d he said, dropping his gaze. \u201cI want to check on Liz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear from her?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, a little bit. But usually it was only when she was having a hard time. I\u2019m telling myself that she\u2019s not having a hard time every day or I\u2019d have gotten more letters. What does Connie say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot. That she\u2019s getting by, that\u2019s about it. How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the right thing to do, Jack. Signing up. It took me out of my head a little. Made me way too tired and most of the time too scared to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling about things now?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m getting closer to living with myself. But Lizzie\u2019s still just a kid. Sixteen now\u2014she\u2019s getting older in spite of herself. She\u2019s been through an awful lot for a girl her age.\u201d</p><p>Jack couldn\u2019t help but think that Ricky was only two years older, yet taking on all the blame as though he was the only one responsible. And he\u2019d been through a lot, too. \u201cI\u2019m going to say this again, son. It wasn\u2019t your fault that baby didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my fault there was a baby,\u201d he said. He took a long pull on his beer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re men, Rick. We\u2019re idiots. Ask Mel,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou take care of your business, then hunt with us a little. Might as well get a lot of unasked-for advice from the boys. They think of you as one of them now\u2014there won\u2019t be any holding them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You going to hunt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jack puffed up a little. \u201cI am. I am going to defy my queen and take a rifle into the woods. But if I hit anything, I\u2019m blaming you.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>When Mel, Jack and Rick got back to Virgin River, the dinner hour was approaching. This boy was one of the town\u2019s favorite sons and everyone would be anxious to see him again, so Rick was dropped off at his grandma\u2019s house merely to scoop her up and take her to the bar. Lydie was a rare patron of the bar, but this was a special occasion.</p><p>It was early, but there were plenty of people already there, waiting to see Rick. Brie and the baby had been in town most of the afternoon already and when David saw Mel, he sent up an alarm, waving his arms at her, squealing with excitement. She couldn\u2019t fill her embrace with him fast enough and couldn\u2019t wait to nurse him. She slipped back into Paige\u2019s little living room to spend some quality time with her boy.</p><p>Preacher had made a big sheet cake with a remarkably good Marine medallion iced onto the center. He\u2019d also put out a lot of snack food and made a huge pot of barbecue with a big basket of buns, potato salad and baked beans, all Rick\u2019s favorites. It wasn\u2019t long before the place started to fill up with friends and neighbors. Mike arrived just minutes before Rick and Lydie, and when the young Marine walked into the bar, a cheer erupted. There were lots of hugs, backslapping, an air of celebration.</p><p>This was the kind of night that always made Jack glad he\u2019d opened this place\u2014surrounded by friends and neighbors, the walls throbbing with happy noise. On a night such as this, there was no charge for the food\u2014a jar was put on the bar for people to drop in whatever they could afford, but no one would be turned away. There was plenty of free beer and sodas\u2014the only things he sold were mixed drinks.</p><p>Once David had had a private reunion with his mother, he held up pretty well during the party, being passed from person to person. Rick took his turn with the baby, astonished at how big he\u2019d gotten in such a short period of time.</p><p>While Brie was up on a bar stool and Jack was at his favorite place behind the bar, he asked her, \u201cHow\u2019d it go, Brie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid was an angel. We stayed very busy, running around visiting people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI had a nice time. Anytime you need an auntie, I\u2019m your girl.\u201d</p><p>He leaned across the bar and put a kiss on her forehead. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was your escape?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cPerfect. My wife missed her baby too much, but then, so did I.\u201d</p><p>After a big dinner and lots of visiting, the farmers, ranchers and business owners began to disappear\u2014that time of night was upon them. Livestock didn\u2019t give days off; people around here got up very early. Rick jumped up on a bar stool, grinning. \u201cFantastic, Jack,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sure is good to be back. I\u2019m going to get my grandma home\u2014she turns in pretty early. Then I\u2019m heading to Eureka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d Jack asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, a slight stain on his young cheeks. He gave a lame shrug. \u201cGotta see that girl. You know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get there kind of late,\u201d Jack pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI bet she\u2019ll wait up,\u201d Rick said. He put out a hand. \u201cThanks for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d he said. And he wanted to add, Please be careful. He followed Rick with his eyes as he walked Lydie out of the bar.</p><p>Mel was beside him, the baby on her left hip while she circled his waist with her right arm. \u201cRick\u2019s on his way to Eureka tonight,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be all right, Jack,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>He shook himself and looked down at Mel. \u201cDamn, I\u2019d feel so much better if they\u2019d just get about ten years older, real fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re such a mother hen. But I just spent two days with Ricky and I\u2019m not worried about him. He\u2019s paying attention. I think I\u2019ll go ahead and take David home, get him settled in his bed. I\u2019m exhausted\u2014it was such a long day. You stay as long as you like.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and gave her a kiss on the head. \u201cI\u2019ll see you a little later.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brie jumped off her stool. \u201cI\u2019ll take you, Mel,\u201d she said.</p><p>And then Jack noticed another thing. A lot had been happening around here, he guessed. While Mel went out the door with David, Brie took a slight detour, finding Mike, who was in a conversation with Paige across the room. She reached for his hand and, holding it, said something to him. Something that made him smile. He leaned toward her and put a peck on her cheek, gave her upper arm a brief squeeze and out the door she went.</p><p>That might not be a good thing, Jack thought. Brie didn\u2019t know Mike the way he did.</p> <p>Once the guest of honor was gone, the bar emptied of partiers. Paige had gone to settle her son into bed in the room upstairs, leaving the three men in the bar alone. Jack got down three glasses. He poured Preacher a shot of his favored whiskey while he chose a single malt scotch for himself. \u201cMike?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow were things while we were gone?\u201d Jack asked Mike as he poured.</p><p>Mike shrugged. \u201cEverything seemed fine,\u201d he answered. \u201cPreach?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d the big man said. \u201cFar as I know. Fine. The boy looks good, Jack. The Corps doesn\u2019t seem to have beat him into mush.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think he takes to it a little,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d Preacher said. He threw back his drink. \u201cCan you boys lock up behind yourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Preacher went through the kitchen to his quarters and Jack tipped the bottle again, giving himself and Mike a splash. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan this,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBut since it\u2019s you and me\u2014tell me about Brie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she was leaving... It looked like there was something....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Brie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jack took a breath, not happily. \u201cAre you with my sister?\u201d</p><p>Mike had a swallow of his whiskey. \u201cI\u2019m taking a day off tomorrow\u2014taking her down the Pacific Coast Highway through Mendocino to look for whales, see the galleries, maybe have a little lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she\u2019d like to do that while she\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, but you know what I\u2019m getting at\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019d better tell me, so I don\u2019t misunderstand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to know what your intentions are toward my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think you have the right to do that? To ask that question?\u201d Mike asked him.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me what was going on between the two of you while I was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, you\u2019d better loosen your grip a little. Brie\u2019s a grown woman. From where I stand, we\u2019re good friends. If you want to know how she sees it, I think she\u2019s the one you have to ask. But I don\u2019t recommend it\u2014she might be offended. Despite everything, she tends to think of herself as a grown-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no secret to you\u2014she\u2019s had a real bad year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no secret,\u201d Mike agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making this really tough, man...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think you are. You spent some time with her tonight. Did it look to you like anything is wrong? Like she\u2019s upset or anything? Because I think everything is fine and you worry too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worry, yeah. I worry that maybe she\u2019ll look to you for some comfort. For something to help her get through. And that you\u2019ll take advantage of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...?\u201d Mike prompted, lifting his glass but not drinking.</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe work a little of your Latin magic on her and walk away.\u201d Jack drank his whiskey. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to do that to her.\u201d</p><p>Mike put down his glass on the bar without emptying it. \u201cI would never hurt Brie. And it has nothing to do with whose sister she is. Good night, Jack.\u201d He left the bar.</p><p>Mike had to do a memory check, remember how he felt about his own sisters, try to get it straight in his head that some of this behavior was beyond Jack\u2019s control. If Jack had looked at one of his younger sisters the way Mike was probably looking at Brie, he might have gotten his back up. Big brothers like me and Jack, we can get proprietary. It wasn\u2019t right, but it was there.</p><p>It pissed Mike off. But more than that, it worried him. He didn\u2019t really think he had much of a chance with Brie for a lot of reasons, but he didn\u2019t want one of those reasons to be his best friend.</p><p>He wished he\u2019d finished that whiskey.</p><p>It was a long time before Mike was able to sleep, even though he hadn\u2019t slept much the previous two nights. He kept wishing Jack and Mel had stayed away a little longer. He\u2019d lain beside her for two wonderful nights. She\u2019d slept right up against him. Platonically, but it had been luxurious. In her sleep she would move closer, snuggle up against him, let him cradle her in the safety of his arms. Trusting him. Believing in him. Her scent still lingered in his mind, real enough so that every once in a while he would catch a whiff so memorable it was almost as though he could reach out and touch her.</p><p>But he was alone tonight. And when sleep finally did come, it was restless and fraught with dreams, the kind he hadn\u2019t had in a long time.</p><p>He saw their bodies as if from above\u2014her pale, ivory skin against his tan Mexican hide, his large hands pressed against her perfect white bottom, holding her tight. Close. Although he watched from above, he could feel every sensation\u2014the light touch of her fingers threading through his black hair, her lips on his neck, his chest, his shoulder. He tasted her skin, crumbled handfuls of her soft honey hair against his face. He was inside her, her knees raised and her pelvis tilted to bring him deeper, and he rocked with her in a gentle but intense pace. Her sighs filled the room; he whispered love words in her ear, encouraging her, telling her how much he wanted to please her.</p><p>He saw her small hands running up and down his back, his shoulders broad once again, restored. And as he told her he loved her, adored her, could never have a life if she was not part of it, she returned his words of love in Spanish. \u201cEstas en mi coraz\u00f3n.\u201d You are my heart. \u201cTe quiero.\u201d I want you. \u201cTe quiero mucho, Miguel.\u201d I want you so much Miguel...Mike.</p><p>He heard her cries, felt her close around him with a hot, tight power so awesome his whole body shuddered convulsively. As she called out his name again and again, he exploded into a climax too grand, more fabulous than he remembered from his earlier life.</p><p>He woke suddenly, panting, his heart hammering, sweat drenching him so that the sheet clung. Alone. But not alone; she\u2019d been with him, beneath him in that nocturnal fantasy turned bliss. And he thought, Oh God! I\u2019m not dead after all!</p><p>His immediate next thought was that he was so grateful that hadn\u2019t happened to him while he slept with her at the cabin. It would have scared her to death.</p><p>Brie rose extra early; three people jockeying around one shower had its challenges. By the time she was toweling off, she could hear Mel and Jack in their bedroom, talking softly in response to the baby\u2019s gurgles and giggles. While she was in the loft dressing, the shower turned on again and again\u2014Mel and Jack getting up for the day. David was back in his bed for an early-morning catnap when she met Jack at the coffeepot. Brie already had a steaming cup in her hand.</p><p>Jack looked her up and down, taking in the skirt, blouse and vest\u2014not her usual country attire. She was dressed for a date. It ate at his gut. He slowly poured a cup of coffee. \u201cMike mentioned he was taking you over to Mendocino,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be tourists for a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Brie, there\u2019s something you should know about Mike. He\u2019s been married twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mel migrated into the kitchen in time for that last exchange. She plucked a cup off the counter, lifted the coffeepot and glared at her husband with a deep sigh. Jack completely ignored her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s known for... Well, for being on the move a lot. Where women are concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, too,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jack put down his cup. \u201cListen to me. I\u2019ve known the man forever. He has a reputation with the women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She laughed. \u201cHas he been hustling the good women of Virgin River and breaking their hearts?\u201d</p><p>Jack scowled at his sister. \u201cHe\u2019s been on hiatus healing up. He\u2019s healed now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, stay out of this,\u201d Mel warned.</p><p>Brie just laughed at her brother. \u201cRelax, Jack. I\u2019m fine with Mike. He\u2019s been a good friend. We\u2019ve talked a lot since June. We even met for lunch a few times. He\u2019s been very supportive through some of this mess I\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>The look on Jack\u2019s face was one of pure shock and it appeared as though the air was briefly sucked out of him. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHe called to see if I was doing all right, we talked, we talked some more, he drove down to the city to get me out of the house for an afternoon, and believe me\u2014it made a difference. We have some things in common, you know. We\u2019re both victims of violent crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one told me this?\u201d he asked, clearly stricken. Betrayed.</p><p>\u201cThere were things about what I\u2019ve been going through that Mike understood. That it would be hard for anyone else to understand,\u201d Brie said.</p><p>\u201cWhy would no one tell me about this? He\u2019s my friend. You\u2019re my sister.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMaybe no one wanted to deal with one of your outbursts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad knew?\u201d he asked, disbelieving.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d Mel warned again. \u201cLeave this alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course Dad knew,\u201d Brie said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t leave the house without telling him exactly where I was going. And God knows, I don\u2019t answer the phone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie, listen, I\u2019d trust the man with my life, but not necessarily with my sister,\u201d he said earnestly, desperately.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t trust the pope with your sister,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you suggest, huh? If it weren\u2019t for Mike, I\u2019d still be lying on the couch, watching the soaps, scared to go out of the house in the middle of the day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you if you needed anything, anything at all...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat my big brother would come racing down to Sacramento to rescue me,\u201d Brie shot back. \u201cWhat makes you think I knew what I needed? I\u2019m pretty grateful Mike had a clue!\u201d</p><p>Mel wandered onto the porch with her coffee cup and stood there, not entirely grateful she could hear the argument going on inside. In five minutes they\u2019d have the baby awake. And in thirty minutes or less, she was going to kill Jack.</p><p>\u201cHe has a knack for that,\u201d Jack blustered. \u201cHe seems to know exactly what it is a woman\u2019s looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking for? You jackass, I\u2019m not looking for anything! I\u2019m trying to get on with my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, that\u2019s great, but if you\u2019d at least talk to me about the ways you\u2019re considering doing that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve been to war with him a couple of times and hunting with him a bunch of times, but what do you think you know about Mike that I can\u2019t figure out in a few months?\u201d Brie asked rather too loudly. \u201cAnd how the hell is he any different around women than you were for about twenty years?\u201d</p><p>Mel took a sip of her coffee and tried, desperately, to remind herself that siblings fought. She and Joey hadn\u2019t had a good knock-down-drag-out since Mel\u2019s first husband had been killed, but growing up, becoming adults, hadn\u2019t exactly put a total end to all disagreements.</p><p>\u201cI was never married!\u201d Jack fired back.</p><p>\u201cProbably through no wisdom of your own!\u201d Brie retorted loudly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mike\u2019s SUV came into the clearing and Mel smiled and gave him a wave. Then she walked into the cabin. \u201cBrie, your ride is here,\u201d she said more calmly than she felt.</p><p>Brie glared at her brother and plucked her purse off the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou have that new gun in your purse?\u201d Jack asked sarcastically.</p> <p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s upstairs in my suitcase. If it had been handy, you might be bleeding through a hole in your stupid head by now.\u201d And she whirled away from them, storming out the door.</p><p>Left alone in the kitchen, Mel stared Jack down for just a second before he turned away from her, presenting his back. He\u2019d just been beaten to a pulp by his little sister; he wasn\u2019t in the mood to go a round with his wife.</p><p>The baby fussed.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d Mel said, leaving the kitchen to see about David.</p><p>When Brie got into Mike\u2019s SUV she was clearly flustered. \u201cWhew,\u201d Mike said. \u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d she snapped. Then, taking a deep breath, \u201cWe had...Words, we had words, me and Jack. About my new gun, which I do not have with me, so relax.\u201d</p><p>He put the car in gear and smiled at her. \u201cI will if you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need about five minutes,\u201d she said. She took a couple of deep breaths. Then it slowly dawned on her\u2014she\u2019d fought! She wasn\u2019t weak and sniveling, wasn\u2019t scared, wasn\u2019t sheepish\u2014she\u2019d gone right back after him! Sure, it was only Jack, not a homicidal predator, but still... She\u2019d always looked for Jack\u2019s approval, and this once she\u2019d stood right up to him, the jerk. A slow smile spread across her lips. Maybe all was not lost. Maybe she could get her life back. She relaxed back onto the seat. \u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cI need a day off. A day away.\u201d From my buttinsky brother, she thought.</p><p>Mel had decided to give Jack some time to cool off and get his head wrapped around the idea that Brie had gone away with Mike for the day, but in the end it was really she who needed the time. Her husband had made her furious. She was spitting tacks.</p><p>When David was down for his morning nap in the crib Mel kept at Doc\u2019s, she left the Hummer at the clinic and took Doc\u2019s old truck out to their homesite. If Doc had to leave, he would call Paige to babysit. When she got to their property, Jack was inside the house where she couldn\u2019t see him, but she could hear the power saw as she pulled up. She drove right up to the front of the house, parked within a few feet and jumped out. She gripped a solid board to hoist herself up onto the foundation and stood there, facing his back. He didn\u2019t turn around and her blood started to boil; he knew she was there. He always knew. When the saw stopped whirring she yelled, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare pretend you don\u2019t know I\u2019m here!\u201d</p><p>He slowly turned around, and he had the audacity to still be wearing that stubborn frown. His eyes were narrowed to slits.</p> <p>\u201cJack Sheridan! Knock it off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my sister. She\u2019s been through a lot,\u201d he said, his voice gravelly and impatient.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2014and she\u2019s entitled to enjoy herself. Make her own choices. It\u2019s important she make her own choices! If she wants to spend time with Mike, she doesn\u2019t need your permission.\u201d</p><p>Jack stepped toward her. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve seen him with women!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I bet! At about the same time he was seeing you with women!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different! That was over when I met you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s over for him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah! You don\u2019t get it! That guy ran through women real quick, never even gave it a thought\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd this is different from you how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe screwed up two marriages! Brie\u2019s already been through a painful divorce, not to mention the other horrible crap she\u2019s endured! I don\u2019t want her hurt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you better butt out before you\u2019re the one who hurts her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never hurt her! I want to keep her safe!\u201d</p><p>Mel put her hands on her hips and lifted one finely arched brow. \u201cThe way you wanted to keep Preacher safe from Paige and almost cost the man the most joy he\u2019s had in his lifetime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit\u2014I was wrong about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about this! No matter what the outcome is, you cannot get in the middle of the relationships that people choose.\u201d She stepped toward him. \u201cJack, she\u2019s lonely and hurt\u2014let her be. Let her go. If she finds a little sliver of happiness, it\u2019s not your job to take its temperature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he hurts her, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll kill him, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s tell her she has to leave. Let\u2019s get her out of here before we have to watch her face hurt one more time. Forget giving her a chance to make herself happy, make herself well. Let\u2019s tell her the truth\u2014you can\u2019t take it while she stumbles along and tries to figure out what\u2019s right for her.\u201d She took a breath; he looked down at his feet. \u201cLike I did,\u201d she said more softly. His head snapped up. \u201cJust like me, Jack. I came into this town so blissfully stupid about the fact that you\u2019d been with a hundred women and never committed to one of them. If I\u2019d had a big brother handy to clue me in\u2014I could have escaped all this happiness.\u201d Tears ran down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d he said, stepping toward her.</p><p>She waved him back, shaking her head. \u201cI haven\u2019t ever been raped,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve been emotionally bruised pretty bad.\u201d Her voice dropped to a whisper and she was shaking her head miserably. \u201cIt should never have worked with you. You of all people! Jesus, you had to have been as bad as Mike, probably worse! You had your women\u2014quick and dirty and back on the road. No commitments. You never loved any of them. It should\u2019ve been like that with me. A couple of months and then you\u2019re bored, you\u2019re moving on....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d he said. This time he wouldn\u2019t be held back. He reached for her, took her into his arms. \u201cGod, baby. Where is this coming from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I got pregnant! You couldn\u2019t get out of it, could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake, Mel...\u201d</p><p>She looked up at his face. \u201cThis is Mike,\u201d she said in a whisper. \u201cThis is a man whose bed you sat by for ten long days, waiting for him to wake up, sit up, speak. He kept your squad safe from insurgents in Fallujah. He came to Virgin River to be near us to get well\u2014do you really think he\u2019s going to treat Brie with disrespect? Do anything bad to her? My God, he sees you as his brother! Where is your brain?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her close, held her against him. \u201cAt this moment I have absolutely no idea.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cTell me something. Do you think I\u2019m going to get bored? Stray? Do you think we\u2019re only together because of David? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at his face, tears wetting her cheeks, and shook her head. \u201cBut if I\u2019d known about you what Mike knows about you\u2014I\u2019d have run for my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I told you, Mel. I never lied to you. It all changed the second I saw you. Tell me you believe me. Tell me I showed you that.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to lay a hand along his cheek. \u201cI believe you. You\u2019ve never given me any reason to doubt you.\u201d</p><p>He let out sigh of relief and pulled her tighter. \u201cGod, don\u2019t do that to me. Don\u2019t throw my shitty past at me like that\u2014you know I can\u2019t talk my way out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m going to talk you off this ledge if it kills me. You can\u2019t do this to your sister. This is up to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. It\u2019s hard, but I understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>She put her arms around his waist, laid her head against his chest and cried. He stroked her hair, kissed her head, held her and rocked with her as they stood inside the unfinished structure. He said things like, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. You know you\u2019re everything to me. You and David.\u201d But what he was thinking was that this was very unusual for his wife. She wouldn\u2019t hesitate to go after him, but she didn\u2019t become distraught. She cried from time to time, but over events that would bring the strongest woman to tears\u2014the loss of a baby, the anniversary of a loved one\u2019s death. And he thought, oh-oh. Something about this isn\u2019t quite right.</p><p>At length she stopped. She looked up at him and he brushed the tears from her cheeks. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cYou made me so frickin\u2019 mad I thought I was going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, join the party. Brie threatened my life.\u201d He smiled down at her. \u201cThank you for not killing me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re right\u2014I have to stop smothering her, questioning her. She\u2019s a grown woman. She\u2019s smarter than me. I\u2019ll try harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo trying,\u201d she said. \u201cLet go. When she comes to you, open your wonderful arms to her, but when she\u2019s trying to get on with her life, toast her. Celebrate her. Let her go. And for God\u2019s sake, please remember that you can trust Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned my lesson. I\u2019ll listen to you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t easy being the wise one in the marriage,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI imagine the pressure is terrible,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>She reached her fingertips up to the hair at his temples. \u201cYou\u2019re showing a little gray here. Not much, but a little. I suppose I did that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But I\u2019m very tough\u2014I can take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack,\u201d she said, leaning against him again. \u201cPlease, I don\u2019t want to ever fight with you.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her chin with a finger. \u201cDon\u2019t be a candy ass. You fought good. You won, as a matter of fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was awful. There have been times since this thing with Brie that you\u2019ve been so far away. It just... It frightens me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should never be afraid. Not while you\u2019re my wife. It\u2019s my job to make sure you\u2019re never afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen know this\u2014all I want is to die in your arms. I can\u2019t live a day without you. Do you get that?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but he said, \u201cNo dying allowed. We\u2019re going to get old and very wrinkly together. I insist on it.\u201d</p><p>Tommy knew he was pretty obvious\u2014he called Brenda every night. When she walked into their physics class he couldn\u2019t suppress a huge grin\u2014he could feel it all the way to the soles of his feet. He scored a homework session with her at her house in Virgin River and it might as well have been a date at the Ritz, he was so pumped. When she walked him out to his truck, she held his hand for a few minutes.</p><p>The girl moved really slowly, and he liked that. One of these days he was going to get his arms around her, kiss her. She had to be about the prettiest girl at school. Maybe the world.</p><p>He\u2019d like to be walking her to her classes, but the second physics was over she was surrounded by her girlfriends and whisked away, so he made do with those phone calls and after-school homework sessions. \u201cWe should go out,\u201d he said. \u201cYou seem to be all over that bad flu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a dance coming up in a few weeks,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou have a date,\u201d he promised. \u201cBut I hate to wait that long. Maybe there\u2019s something we can do before that. As a warm-up date?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cYou\u2019re too funny. Stop looking at me and look at your physics homework.\u201d</p><p>Brenda\u2019s mother stayed awfully close while he was at her house, so there was no potential for getting snugly. But he was completely okay with this, because when Brenda walked him out to his little truck there was a moment on the front porch that she let him get close. He slipped an arm around her waist. And she kind of leaned against him, so he let his lips brush softly against her cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know your hair smells like vanilla?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course I know that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou sure do make homework a lot more fun than it used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to be of help,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>\u201cHey, you want to go to a party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard there\u2019s something going on out at this rest stop\u2014\u201d</p><p>She jumped away from him so fast, he was startled. The look on her face was one of sheer horror.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t go to those parties,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay. That\u2019s fine. I just thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you go to those parties?\u201d she asked angrily.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t been to one yet. I just heard about it. Why? Are they bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of beer. A lot of kids get drunk. Puking drunk.\u201d</p><p>He made a face. \u201cEw. Sounds like loads of fun. Okay, how about a movie in Fortuna?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong? Did I say something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just... Those parties out at the rest stop, they have a real bad reputation. I don\u2019t want a reputation.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cAs far as I can tell, you already have one, and it\u2019s totally good. So\u2014\u201d he shrugged \u201c\u2014we\u2019ll skip the rest-stop parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drink beer?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been known to have a beer,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t overdo it. You have to meet my father, Brenda.\u201d He laughed. \u201cThen you\u2019d know right away that I don\u2019t want to piss him off.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to relax a little. \u201cI might go to a movie with you. But we should have another couple along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike who?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe one of my girlfriends and her date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever makes you happy. But I want to go out with you sometime\u2014because all this homework is making me so smart I almost can\u2019t stand myself.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and said, \u201cOkay, Tommy. Call me later.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>Brie couldn\u2019t believe she had lived in California all her life without ever visiting the Mendocino coast. It charmed her at once\u2014the breathtaking vistas, the Victorian villages, the art, the food. She recognized Cabot Cove, the filming site for Murder, She Wrote. They lunched in an adorable little restaurant with an ocean view, binoculars on the tables. Before they had finished lunch, they were sharing binoculars to view a fleet of whales, migrating south. The mammals were so far out to sea, the binoculars were necessary.</p><p>\u201cIn the spring, during the migration with their new calves, they come much closer to the shore. We\u2019ll come back,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>The excuse to come over here had been seeing the whales, but there was much more to the coast than that. They dropped into galleries, tasted wine in tasting rooms, walked along the ocean bluffs, down the trails to the tide pools and private beaches. They visited botanical gardens, climbed to the top of a lighthouse and sat under a tree in the park, eating popcorn. They laughed, played, held hands. Too soon, the day had aged.</p><p>\u201cWe should at least stay for the sunset,\u201d Mike suggested. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like a Pacific sunset. Would you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would. Do you think I should call Jack? Let him know?\u201d</p><p>Mike shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of arrangement you two have. Would he be worried if you\u2019re not home before dark?\u201d</p><p>Remembering her brother\u2019s dark mood in the morning, the way he\u2019d tried to warn her off Mike, she almost said that Jack would be especially worried tonight. But instead she said, \u201cAs a courtesy, I\u2019ll give him a call. I\u2019m really having too much fun to go back yet.\u201d</p><p>He touched her cheek with the back of a knuckle. \u201cAre you, Brie?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a phone,\u201d he said, pointing across the street. \u201cDo you have plenty of change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get us some drinks. We can take them to the bluffs and watch from there.\u201d</p><p>Jack came to the phone in the bar and Brie told him she was having a wonderful time and they planned to watch the sunset over the ocean before heading back. Although she tried to keep her voice passive and not defensive, she really expected some kind of argument. Instead, her brother said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about this morning, Brie. I was out of line. That wasn\u2019t my place\u2014I want you to enjoy yourself. I mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, Jack,\u201d she said, amused. \u201cYou sure came around quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a genius that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel must have really lit into you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat always increases my intelligence about tenfold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d She laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ll be home later.\u201d She was still chuckling to herself when she crossed the street to meet Mike.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d she said, laughing again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as I was leaving this morning, he warned me about your irresponsible ways with women\u2014but now he\u2019s docile as a lamb, apologizing, telling me to have a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s starting to get on my nerves when he does that thing about the women,\u201d he said, taking her elbow and steering her toward the bluffs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been all over that. He can give it a rest anytime. He had a million women before Mel. Two million.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cYou never mentioned to him that we spent a lot of time together over the summer,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014it wasn\u2019t because you\u2019re Jack\u2019s sister. I met you because of Jack\u2014I care about you because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him you spent the nights he was away in his bed?\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cWould I be walking around today if I had? You know that would put him in a black mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have explained\u2014I asked you to come, to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis would be Jack Sheridan\u2019s little sister. He would\u2019ve expected me to sit guard out on the porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him I got scared?\u201d</p><p>He slipped an arm loosely, cautiously, around her waist. \u201cYou would have told him if you had wanted him to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one of us are you protecting?\u201d she asked with a laugh.</p><p>He was conscious that she didn\u2019t pull away from him. \u201cYou and me, our privacy. What goes on with us just isn\u2019t his business. If you want to know\u2014he asked. I don\u2019t know how he picked up the scent, since apparently no one clued him in. I must be losing my touch\u2014I\u2019ve become obvious. I used to be slicker than that. But he wanted to know if there was something going on between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you said...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that I would never do anything to hurt you and if he wanted to know anything, he should ask you. I suggested he be very careful about that because you consider yourself a grown-up.\u201d</p><p>That made her laugh rather happily. \u201cOh, I bet you really pissed him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it. He pissed me off.\u201d</p><p>They walked the headlands trail to the bluffs and found a place on the grassy knoll to sit. The sun was already making its downward path and Brie found herself hoping it wouldn\u2019t go quickly. They were hardly alone there\u2014lots of people strolled, children ran around, lovers paused to embrace, kiss.</p><p>Mike sat with his legs stretched out in front of him; Brie curled her legs under her and braced herself on an arm, close to him. \u201cHere,\u201d Mike said, gently pulling her back to recline against his chest. \u201cBe comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Leaning against his broad chest, she felt herself relax in a way she hadn\u2019t in months. With this interlude coming at the end of day like this, she was as close to carefree as she\u2019d been in too long. Feeling the strength of him behind her was like a foundation. It didn\u2019t hurt that she\u2019d slept beside him for two nights and he had been perfect. And she began to think, I was wrong about what I can feel. I can feel things. Closeness and trust, for one thing. Security. He made her feel safe, and not just safe from danger. She had absolutely no worry that trusting him was foolish.</p><p>The sun set very slowly, the number of people dwindled as it darkened and soon it was almost as if they were alone. They reclined on the bluffs in silence for a long time, until it was nearly dark. The dark no longer seemed to bother her, because she was with Mike.</p><p>Finally she said, very softly, \u201cIs there anything between us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think there\u2019s much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am determined to do anything I can to be there for you, and you are determined to break my heart. That heartbreaking business, it\u2019s very serious.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. She felt his head drop forward to her shoulder and nuzzle her hair. A hand on her upper left arm gently squeezed and he said, \u201cBrie... Tu creas un fuego en mi coraz\u00f3n.\u201d Brie, you create a fire in my heart.</p><p>She straightened a bit, but didn\u2019t pull away. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou are lovely. You touch my heart,\u201d he answered, pulling her back against him again. He slipped an arm around her waist gently, tenderly, cautiously holding her against him, very careful that she not feel confined. \u201cTu debes sentir estas manos amorosas as\u00ed a ti.\u201d You should feel loving hands on you.</p><p>Her heart beat a little faster and she knew that it was not fear she felt. She wanted to say, \u201cDeja a que sean sus manos.\u201d Let them be your hands. But she wasn\u2019t ready. Instead, she said, \u201cYour language is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTe tengo en mis brazos,\u201d he said. I will hold you in my arms.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you said,\u201d she urged him.</p><p>\u201cNothing, really. Just an endearment. It is a very romantic language.\u201d</p><p>She could tell him now she spoke his language fluently, that she knew he lied. But she didn\u2019t want to break the spell he had created in thinking she couldn\u2019t understand him. He spoke his heart while he thought she was innocent of his desires. \u201cSay something to me\u2014something heartfelt,\u201d she said, not turning around.</p><p>He touched the hair at her temple, threading his fingers into it. \u201cTe querido m\u00e1s te de lo tu hubieras.\u201d I have wanted you for longer than you know.</p><p>She let her eyes close. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d she asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve all happiness,\u201d he said\u2014he lied.</p><p>A small smile floated across her face. She was on to him.</p><p>\u201cNo te merezco.\u201d I don\u2019t deserve you. \u201cTe quiero en mi vida.\u201d I want you in my life.</p><p>\u201cI think you seduce women with your language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you are with me, you should know that I care about you as much as I care about any of my sisters. Or my mother, who is queen of the world.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that was entirely flattering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to believe you are completely safe and protected when you\u2019re with me. I promise you, you have nothing to fear from me. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re manipulating me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you, now?\u201d he asked, humor in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re luring me into a false sense of security, trying to trick me so I forget my plan to break your heart a hundred times.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, stroking that long mane of hair that floated down her back. \u201cI know you\u2019re a very determined woman, and if breaking my heart is your goal, you won\u2019t rest until it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make mincemeat out of you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt.\u201d</p><p>She pivoted to face him. It was dark enough so that it was hard to see the light in his eyes. She leaned toward him and put her lips softly against his. Her kiss was very tentative. Brief. Cautionary. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll have to lure you into my confidence first.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA good idea,\u201d he said, aware that his voice had become husky. \u201cTienes labios que gritan besame.\u201d You have lips that scream kiss me. And he slowly, carefully, leaned toward her. He touched her mouth, drawing her lower lip between his lips sweetly, sensuously. He wanted to put his hands on her, but he was unsure what she could tolerate. He let one large hand touch her waist delicately, but he didn\u2019t apply pressure and didn\u2019t pull her to him. \u201cI think I like this\u2014being drawn into your confidence. I knew the heart-breaking would be something to look forward to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I could do this,\u201d she said a little breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cI knew,\u201d he said. \u201cI told you. It was just a matter of time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get us into trouble....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Brie. There\u2019s no trouble here, no problem. Everything is all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound overconfident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not trying for an upset? Trying to break my heart before I can break yours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEstas en mi coraz\u00f3n.\u201d You are my heart. \u201cGo ahead. Do your worst. I\u2019m strong. I welcome the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d she said. \u201cKiss me one time, as though you don\u2019t find me breakable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He chuckled, a husky sound. \u201cAre you sure you mean that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust once,\u201d she said, her voice a breath.</p><p>He circled her waist with his arms and drew her forward, pulling her across his lap and against his chest. Her hands rested lightly on his shoulders, waiting. He hovered over her lips for a moment. He let the flesh of his lips touch hers. Slowly, giving her time to change her mind, he pressed against her mouth. Her hands slowly drifted upward, circling his neck, a hand reaching up to the back of his head, holding him against her mouth, and with a groan of desire he moved over her mouth passionately, opening his lips. Hers opened as well, admitting his tongue. He wanted to die, the taste of her was so sweet, so delicious. He pulled her harder against him, feeling her firm breasts bore into his chest.</p><p>And it happened to him. He became aroused. It was the first time he had responded this way in so long that for a second he wanted to grasp her to him, lower her to the ground and press himself against her. But the hell of it was, he couldn\u2019t proceed with her. She was just testing these waters and was still so unsure, so easily frightened. This kiss, this deep and wet and wonderful kiss, was a huge step for her. It was possible, lying across his lap as she was, that she felt his desire rising beneath her. And he didn\u2019t want her to be afraid.</p> <p>He heard her sigh, her breath soft against his face, and he withdrew from her lips. \u201cBrie, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t kiss you like this. You tempt me. And you\u2019re not ready to be with a tempted man. I have to take you home.\u201d</p><p>She sat back, sliding off his lap and, a little rattled, brushed at her skirt. \u201cWhew,\u201d she said.</p><p>He ran a hand from her shoulder down her arm. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go. It\u2019s dark now. And we\u2019ve had a full day.\u201d</p><p>Jack was splitting logs in the early morning when Mike came from his RV. His hands plunged into his pockets, heading toward the bar for coffee, he said, \u201cMorning\u201d as he walked by.</p> <p>\u201cMike,\u201d Jack called after him. Mike turned and Jack leaned the ax against the stump. \u201cI should probably say something about the other night,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI can\u2019t figure out what.\u201d</p><p>Mike grinned in spite of himself. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. I\u2019d love to hear what you come up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about\u2014I\u2019ll stay out of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it, but I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have sisters. You know where I\u2019m coming from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mike said, taking a step toward him. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care about her. Worry about her.\u201d</p><p>Mike stepped toward him. He put a hand out to shake. When Jack took it Mike said, \u201cI\u2019m not talking to you about her. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boys will be here to hunt in a couple of days,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019m going to Eureka for some supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed a hand with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Need anything while I\u2019m there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor refusing to talk about her. Says something.\u201d He put a hand on Mike\u2019s shoulder, directing him ahead toward the bar. \u201cLet\u2019s get a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>An hour later Jack was gone to Eureka and Mel\u2019s Hummer was parked in front of Doc\u2019s. Mike drove out of town. He thought it was possible Brie was at Doc\u2019s with Mel, but he didn\u2019t stop to check, didn\u2019t want to tip his hand. He pulled into the clearing at the cabin and gave the horn on his SUV three short toots. Then he stepped out and leaned against the driver\u2019s door. In just a couple of moments she appeared on the porch, her damp hair pulled over one shoulder as she patted it dry with a towel. She wore slim jeans and moccasins on her feet. She looked so young, so vulnerable. She smiled when she saw him. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He pushed his Rio Concho back on his head. \u201cChecking in. How are you this morning?\u201d</p><p>She tossed the towel onto the Adirondack chair and came down the porch steps toward him. \u201cFine. Very fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look fifteen,\u201d he said, feeling every one of his thirty-seven years. She took a step closer and he put his hands on her waist; she put her hands on his forearms and looked up at him. He twisted his hands at her waist, wiggling her a little closer. Then his arms went around her waist and he lifted her up so that her face was level to his. Her hands rested lightly on his shoulders. \u201cI missed you,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so? Are you coming on to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie, I\u2019ve been coming on to you for six months,\u201d he said. \u201cHow\u2019m I doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help that. I have no savoir faire.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him and plucked the hat off his head, holding it behind him. \u201cI think you have more than you deserve. Enough to be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you I\u2019m an innocent.\u201d He touched her lips lightly with his. Tentatively. \u201cMy days of being dangerous to women are over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so? And when did that happen?\u201d</p><p>He gave a shrug. \u201cA few months ago I began to lose interest in other women. A few weeks ago, it was over. There is only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wooing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you mean business, you should kiss me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I was hoping you would say that.\u201d He covered her mouth with a passionate kiss, holding her close against him. Her mouth opened under his lips at once and he probed with his tongue. She not only let him in, she welcomed him in, moving over his mouth with lips that were hot and urgent, holding him tightly. From what he could taste, she was enjoying the kiss very much; she moaned softly and grew breathless. He couldn\u2019t remember when he had last kissed a woman before Brie. A thousand years ago, surely. She tasted like honey, so sweet and pure.</p><p>He hated for it to ever end and when it did, she whispered, \u201cWould you like to come inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re not really ready for me to come inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me wonder what I\u2019m ready for.\u201d She kissed him again. Deeply and passionately.</p><p>\u201cWhen you no longer wonder, we\u2019ll talk,\u201d he whispered against her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou could take advantage of my weakness,\u201d she said.</p><p>He put her back on her feet and put a soft kiss on her forehead. \u201cThere will be no taking, mi amor. Only giving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my. I can see why women would marry you so easily.\u201d</p><p>He touched her nose. \u201cBrie, it was never like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t believe me either, but it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her to him and she leaned into him, resting her head on his chest, her arms around his waist. He held her like that, both of them quiet for a long time, just enjoying the closeness. He stroked her back and dropped soft kisses onto her damp hair, feeling more alive than he had in such a long, long time. It filled him with pride that she didn\u2019t tense or tremble while he held her. She had slowly become accustomed to his touch, his embrace, and knew that she was safe and loved in his arms. Even if nothing more ever came, he felt he had already won the prize.</p><p>\u201cYou know the boys are coming to hunt?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes. Jack\u2019s getting ready for them. Will you hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Which means I won\u2019t be around town much during the day. If you need me for some reason, you\u2019ll have to let me know beforehand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m helping Mel with a big project she has going on. Something about free mammograms for the women around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Later.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a peck on the lips and pushed her gently away, taking his hat out of her hand, then got back into the SUV and drove away. He watched in his rearview mirror and saw that she stayed outside in the clearing in front of the cabin until he was out of sight.</p><p>When Mel went into the bar for her morning coffee, David contented in the stroller after his breakfast, she found Paige sitting at one of the tables with the newspaper spread out in front of her. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Mel asked, parking David by the table while she went for a mug and some coffee.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Paige said. \u201cHi, coochie,\u201d she said to the baby, making him smile. She automatically took a toast crust from her nearly empty plate and gave it to him to teethe on. He was delighted by it.</p><p>Mel brought her coffee to Paige\u2019s table and sat with her. She noticed David gnawing on the toast and smiled. \u201cIsn\u2019t that good?\u201d she said to the baby. \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d she asked Paige.</p><p>\u201cHmm. I think Jack has gone to Eureka for supplies. I offered to do that\u2014the boys are going to be here pretty soon. He said he\u2019d get it, then next thing I knew he wasn\u2019t around. John\u2019s in the back, setting up lunch, with Christopher underfoot as usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Mike?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Paige shrugged.</p><p>Preacher came out of the kitchen with a tray of glasses. He put them under the bar roughly. \u201cHey, Preach,\u201d Mel said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEureka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my day to watch him,\u201d he said gruffly, going back to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cJeez,\u201d Mel said. She looked at Paige and met twinkling eyes. \u201cSomething funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn appears to be a little tense. Amazing he got through so many years without sex every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery day?\u201d Mel asked. \u201cWell, holy shit, his count must be down to nothing!\u201d She looked over her shoulder to make sure they were alone. \u201cHow\u2019s he handling the drought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a little testy,\u201d Paige said, amused. \u201cI keep telling him this is entirely up to him. If it\u2019s too much, we can make a few adjustments. But he wants to do it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope he doesn\u2019t explode,\u201d Mel said absently.</p><p>\u201cHe asked if we can close the bar on ovulation day.\u201d</p><p>Mel\u2019s eyes widened in surprise and they both melted into laughter.</p><p>Jack hadn\u2019t seen Rick in a couple of days. He hadn\u2019t been back from Eureka for long when Rick showed up. A couple of hunters were having a late breakfast at one of the tables, so Rick jumped up on the bar stool and Jack fixed him up with a cup of coffee. \u201cWelcome back,\u201d Jack said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe party was great, Jack. Thanks again for everything you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. This town has a habit of turning out for important people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been checking on Liz,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s doing great. You can\u2019t believe how good she looks. Beautiful, in fact.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she could get more beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat checking business seems to work out for you pretty well,\u201d Jack said, lifting his cup. \u201cYour complexion looks a little clearer.\u201d</p><p>Rick laughed and ducked his head a little. \u201cHere\u2019s how it is, Jack. Me and Liz\u2014it\u2019s not cut-and-dried. I\u2019m going to finish my hitch, alone. We\u2019re not going to make any promises to each other until that time\u2019s up.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna let Liz get a little older, finish school, see where we are. I want her to have a chance, you know. If this isn\u2019t right for her\u2014hooking up with me\u2014then I want her to have the space and time to move on. In the meantime, for right now, we\u2019re still a little too locked in to each other. You can understand that, can\u2019t you? After everything... Well,\u201d he said, lifting his mug and taking a sip, \u201cwe have a pretty strong bond. I\u2019ll be there for her as long as she needs me\u2014it\u2019s the least I can do. I\u2019m not going to tell her she can\u2019t feel it, that she has to try to get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-ho.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI feel it pretty good. That girl really does it to me. She always has. It\u2019s just going to take some time to know if it\u2019s permanent or just something that happened to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not taking any chances, are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not. And I mean, absolutely not. I don\u2019t want you to worry. I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m a total idiot who never heard a word you were saying.\u201d</p><p>Jack put his hand over Rick\u2019s forearm. \u201cI don\u2019t think that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Rick was quiet for a minute or so. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, Jack. When there isn\u2019t a lot of pain. When there aren\u2019t any tears. Nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou hunting with us? Or you just going to spend your whole leave working on your complexion?\u201d</p><p>Rick grinned. \u201cI\u2019m hunting,\u201d he said. He drank a little of his coffee. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing that much hunting, are we?\u201d</p><p>The whole town of Virgin River looked forward to the visits of the Marine brothers\u2014they brought such an air of camaraderie and celebration when they came. The first to arrive in his truck with camper shell was Zeke, who came from Fresno. He was in town by early afternoon. Just a couple of hours later came Joe Benson and Paul Haggerty together, pulling a fifth wheel behind a truck\u2014they were good friends who often worked together, Paul building Joe\u2019s houses whenever possible. Then came Corny, who drove in from Washington State but hailed from Nebraska\u2014thus the nickname. Next, Phillips and Stephens\u2014Josh and Tom\u2014both from Nevada, right on the other side of the Sierras. By 6:00 p.m. everyone was present, even Rick, and the din in the bar was raised to an all-time high.</p> <p>Doc Mullins was in the midst of the throng, enjoying his one whiskey of the day with the guys, David was being passed from Marine to Marine, jostled as if being weighed, Rick was getting an awful lot of free advice and Mel, Brie and Paige were hugged so much they felt their bones crunching. Of course, others from town made brief appearances, wanting to be a part of the reunion for at least a little while, but not wanting to get in the way. Connie and Ron and their friends Joy and Bruce put in appearances. Harv dropped in for a beer after work, as did Doug Carpenter and Fish Bristol.</p><p>Paul dropped an arm around Mel\u2019s shoulders and asked, \u201cWhy the long face? Aren\u2019t you having fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate hunting. I can handle ducks, but not deer. I mean, I don\u2019t want to pass judgment\u2014I just wish my husband didn\u2019t shoot deer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mel, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve been hunting with your husband\u2014the deer are completely safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelinda, we\u2019ll have venison all winter. You\u2019ll love it,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mel,\u201d Paul whispered. \u201cHe\u2019ll never get a thing. They can smell him coming.\u201d</p><p>Some people came into the bar and Mel immediately recognized Vanessa, her newest patient. The older gentleman with her must be her father. She left Paul\u2019s side and went to her immediately, embracing her in welcome, and was then introduced to Walt, her dad.</p><p>Paul just stood where he was, glassy-eyed with a faraway smile on his lips. Vanessa! His best friend\u2019s wife. Then Vanessa spotted him and went to him instantly, arms open wide. He hugged her, rocking her back and forth a little. Then he held her away from him and stared approvingly at her belly, which was growing nice and round. \u201cI had no idea you\u2019d be here,\u201d he said, refusing to take his arms from around her.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to surprise you. My dad\u2019s retirement ranch is just down the road and I\u2019m staying there while Matt\u2019s in Iraq. Mel\u2019s going to deliver my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few months. Gosh, it\u2019s so good to see you. I haven\u2019t seen you since\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wedding,\u201d he answered. \u201cGod, Vanni\u2014you\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d He touched her belly. \u201cJesus, he kicked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what it is yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta be a guy,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>She was joined by her dad, his hand out to Paul in greeting. \u201cGeneral, good to see you, sir,\u201d Paul said. \u201cLet me introduce you two around,\u201d he said.</p><p>Several of the guys knew Matt, but the only person in the room to have already met Walt, General Booth, was Mike. Because of his investigation of teens, he\u2019d been to the Booth household. And although the general invited them all to address him by his given name, only the women seemed so inclined. For these Marines, rank had its privileges. General Booth declined the offer to join the hunting party, saying he might take them up on that the next time. After about twenty minutes of introductions and conversation, Paul grabbed Vanessa\u2019s hand, dragged her off to the table nearest the hearth and sat her down there to talk, to catch up. He wanted to hear all about Matt, about her little brother Tommy, about how she liked living way out here, so far from everything.</p><p>And she wanted to know everything that was going on with him. Paul, thirty-five like Matt, had left the Marines after four and remained in the reserves while Matt stayed active. Paul had finished his degree and joined his family\u2019s construction company in Grants Pass, Oregon, not far from the California border. \u201cAnd are you seeing anyone?\u201d she asked him, grabbing his hand across the table.</p><p>\u201cNah, not really. Until someone as pretty as you comes along, I\u2019ll just keep looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been too shy for your own good. You should be married and have a ton of kids. You\u2019d make such a great dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I should,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Paul,\u201d she said. \u201cWill I be seeing more of you now? While I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, I get down here sometimes.\u201d</p><p>At about eight o\u2019clock the crowd thinned out a little bit. Mel and Brie took the baby home, giving Jack strict orders to sleep in the RV on the pullout if he had too much to drink with his boys. Paige had already gone upstairs to bathe Christopher and get him into bed and the general took his daughter home, promising to drop in the next night for a beer and a debrief on the hunt. Rick went home to his grandma\u2019s and promised to be back at 4:00 a.m. for the trek back into Trinity to hunt.</p><p>When it was down to Marines, the cards, money and cigars came out. Poker ensued. At about ten Paige swam through the smoke and tapped Preacher on the shoulder. He folded his hand, having nothing anyway, and said, \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, it\u2019s weird, seeing Preach act like the little husband,\u201d Stephens said.</p><p>\u201cLittle husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m saying. All Paige has to do is lift her pinkie finger and he\u2019s on his knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are your eyes, man? She can lift that little finger my way and I\u2019d get on my knees,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cThe little husband might pound you into sand,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI meant if she weren\u2019t married. You old farts are starting to act real whipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because we are,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s good. It\u2019s very, very good.\u201d</p><p>Preacher came back, lifted his cigar and took a pull. \u201cI\u2019m not hunting tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ovulation day,\u201d he said with a straight face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what?\u201d three men asked in unison.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s frickin\u2019 ovulation day, jag-off. We\u2019re trying to make a baby and if I miss ovulation day, who knows how long I\u2019ll have to wait. I don\u2019t feel like waiting. I\u2019ve been waiting.\u201d</p><p>His explanation was met with completely nonplussed silence\u2014no one at the table knew about this quest, including Jack. And after a moment of stunned silence, laughter erupted that was so loud and wild, the men were nearly falling off their chairs.</p><p>When the group got a little under control, Preacher asked, \u201cIs there something funny about ovulation day? Because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s not funny, Preach,\u201d Joe said. \u201cIt\u2019s cute, that\u2019s what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut really, Preach, you should hunt and leave me home\u2014I\u2019d probably make a better-looking baby than you, anyway,\u201d Zeke said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made enough frickin\u2019 babies, jag-off,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cYour wife sent you up here to hunt so she can catch a break. Whose deal is it anyway?\u201d</p><p>While they dealt a few more hands, Jack noticed that Paul didn\u2019t seem to be laughing as much as the others, but he was drinking more. Paul folded his hand, left the game, poured himself a shot from the bottle on the bar and sat up on a stool. Jack had them deal him out and went behind the bar. Paul turned pinkened, watery eyes toward him. \u201cOh, boy,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hate yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it,\u201d he agreed with a slight slur, drinking another shot nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking it has something to do with Vanessa,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cMatt\u2019s my best friend. That would be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened. For me, anyway.\u201d He put his empty glass on the bar.</p><p>Jack was sure Paul had already had too much, but he poured. \u201cOkay, now I\u2019m just taking advantage of you,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m curious. She said you and Matt were together the night you met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I should\u2019ve stopped going out with him years ago. I spotted her first.\u201d</p><p>Jack kind of lifted his brows. \u201cHow\u2019d he get her, then?\u201d</p><p>Paul threw back his drink. \u201cI think the son of a bitch said dibs.\u201d And then he put his head down on the bar and passed out.</p><p>So that\u2019s how it went. Because if Matt was the first one to get to her, talk to her, and if she was impressed enough to go out with him, a Marine doesn\u2019t mess with a brother\u2019s woman. Not even Valenzuela would do that. That was a line even he had never crossed\u2014not his Mexican brothers and not his Marine brothers. Because he liked living....</p><p>Whoa, damn, Jack thought. And now she\u2019s married, pregnant and Paul is still miserably drawn to her. That bites.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d he said to the boys. \u201cBack here at four. Someone has to put Haggerty to bed.\u201d He shrugged into his jacket. \u201cTry not to burn the place down, huh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eight</p><p>Mel had asked Brie to help with a pet project she\u2019d been working on since David was born. While Brie was happy to help Mel in anything she asked, she was a bit surprised by how much she enjoyed this particular project.</p><p>While Mel had been at home with her newborn, she\u2019d had time to go online on her laptop, plus she could make phone calls while he slept. The women in her town were mostly uninsured. They would pay whatever they could afford for medical care, often in goods and services. Some of the ranchers and farmers had insurance to cover catastrophic illness or accident, but that left nothing for the cost of well visits, like pap smears and mammograms. Mel had been able to step up the annual pap smears by offering to charge only for the lab costs, and by doing a little bit of hounding. But when it came to mammograms, which she believed her patients over the age of forty should have every year, most of her women were making do on breast self-exam. She had ninety-two women over the age of eighteen in town, and forty-eight of them were over forty. At least forty of those women were not getting annual mammograms.</p> <p>She had tracked down a mobile unit that was operated by a foundation\u2014and with the help of Dr. June Hudson in Grace Valley, they were trying to put together a visit from this unit to their towns. They could hold a mammogram event day, turn it into a party and get everyone x-rayed. \u201cWe can get them to come on the cheap, but we\u2019ll still have to come up with some money\u2014probably more than most of my patients can afford,\u201d Mel had said.</p><p>June had had a perfect idea for subsidizing the cost. The fall festival in Grace Valley was coming up soon\u2014the second weekend in October. They planned to set up a booth and sell homespun small-town items, from needlework to baked goods. There were lots of city folks who flocked to the festival looking for some of that small-town mystique. Mel\u2019s mission was to go around Virgin River, from farm to ranch to neighbors in town, requesting donated items they could sell at the mammogram booth.</p><p>Recruiting Brie was not only a great help, but fun for Mel to introduce her sister-in-law. On the days the Marines were off hunting, Mel and Brie drove the back roads of Virgin River, visiting all the women Mel knew\u2014those who had attended her baby shower and parties at the bar, women who had been patients over the past year. Brie was meeting many of them for the first time and was instantly charmed by their welcoming natures, the way they drew her in as if she\u2019d been around for years. Every stop they made involved at least a cup of coffee, usually cookies or thin slices of cake, so that by the time the day was drawing to a close, they were too stuffed to even think about dinner. And of course David was with them all day long, which amounted to a lot of cuddling all over town. Snuggling and sugar, since country women couldn\u2019t stand it if they couldn\u2019t put a cookie in his fat little hand.</p><p>The Virgin River women were fantastic\u2014little surprise. They promised everything from pies to quilts\u2014stock that would be picked up the day before the festival or brought to Grace Valley by the women themselves.</p><p>When they got back to town the hunters had returned and Mel was delighted to see no evidence of murdered wildlife in the truck beds or tied to roofs. But her elation was short-lived, because once inside the bar she learned that they had bagged two bucks, four-by-fours, both of which had already been taken to the meat processor to be butchered. \u201cOh,\u201d she whined emotionally. \u201cWho did it?\u201d</p> <p>Jack looked at his feet. But he made an attempt. \u201cI think Ricky did it.\u201d</p><p>Mel met Rick\u2019s eyes and the boy put up two hands, palms toward her. It wasn\u2019t him. Mel leaned against her husband and, unbelievably, started to cry. Jack shook his head, put an arm around her and led her away from the gathering, back toward the kitchen. As he did so, David was bouncing up and down on Mel\u2019s hip, waving his arms wildly and reaching for his dad. \u201cMelinda,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou knew we were going hunting. We didn\u2019t torture the deer. We\u2019re going to have venison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it,\u201d she sniveled.</p><p>\u201cI know you hate it, but it\u2019s not a cruel thing. It\u2019s probably more humane than the way cattle are slaughtered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to make me feel better about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, I wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cI\u2019m weepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit. Here, let me have him. He\u2019s out of his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar,\u201d she said. \u201cI should go nurse him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be riding his bike up to the breast before long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to give it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable. But you\u2019re worn out. Maybe you should go home and go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t sleep till he sleeps. And he isn\u2019t going to sleep until he detoxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Jack said, taking his son. \u201cGo cry or wash your face or nap or something. I\u2019ll hang on to the wild one until he calms down a little.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cThis really isn\u2019t like you. Not even over deer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy the way, you smell really bad,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, my love. You smell really good. I\u2019ll wash this off before I smell the rest of you, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She let go of her son and went to the bathroom while Jack took David back to the gathering.</p><p>\u201cIs she all right?\u201d Brie asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. She loves the deer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to take him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, he\u2019s fine. He needs to work off your afternoon. Let me guess\u2014you stopped at every farm and ranch in Virgin River and he\u2019s had fifty cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not fifty...\u201d</p><p>He looked at his son\u2019s face. His eyes were wild, his smile bright and drooly, his arms flapping. \u201cSomeone should have been in charge,\u201d he said. \u201cHave a beer, Brie. In fact, we should probably give this one a beer\u2014he\u2019s electric. Jeez.\u201d</p><p>Just as he made that suggestion, Mike brought Brie a beer and when she took it, he draped an arm around her shoulders with familiarity. There was really no need for Mike to talk about her with him, Jack thought. He was working on celebrating her, as he had been instructed to do. But whatever was going on between Mike and Brie, it was putting a light in both their eyes. He was trying to relax about that.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014you make that baby today?\u201d someone yelled at Preacher.</p><p>\u201cI believe I did,\u201d he said, sticking his chest out.</p><p>Paige brought a big platter of wings out to the bar and said, \u201cJohn, shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I believe I did. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, shook her head in disgust and said, \u201cYou certainly did your best,\u201d and turned to walk back into the kitchen.</p><p>Mike pulled Brie aside and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the only woman on the premises who\u2019s not just a little pissed off at her guy. Wanna run away with me right now? Before I do something stupid?\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cYou think you\u2019re my guy, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping....\u201d</p><p>A total of three deer were bagged, but no bear. The Marines left Virgin River, Ricky went back into active duty and the next weekend brought the Grace Valley fall festival. A sign was posted on the bar door\u2014Closed. And below it a map, giving directions to Grace Valley.</p><p>Trucks, cars and SUVs were loaded with items for the mammogram booth. Mel, Brie and Jack left early with the baby and a truck packed with donations. They met Paige, Preacher and Christopher there to set up. Through the day, women from Virgin River arrived with even more wares to put out and everyone took their turn at working the booth\u2014and items were disappearing like crazy. Mel didn\u2019t have to sit there the entire day, but she stayed close to keep an eye on their growing funds.</p><p>The day was filled with visiting old friends and meeting new.</p><p>By the time darkness was falling and the booths were mostly shut down, Mel was growing so tired she thought her very bones ached. They had absolutely nothing left to sell on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the banner and a donation jar out here tomorrow,\u201d June said. \u201cEven if we get just a few dollars more, I\u2019m sure we\u2019re close to what we need to bring the mammo RV out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Mel asked. \u201cI\u2019m so shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be here anyway\u2014we keep the clinic staffed during the fair. It won\u2019t be any trouble.\u201d</p><p>When the sun went down, the band set up behind the caf\u00e9 and there was dancing and fireworks. The raffles were called out, and someone had rented a dunking booth that seemed to keep everyone in Grace Valley entertained as their local hotshots took their turns on the seat.</p><p>While Mel held David and watched the dancing, Jack came to her, slipped his arms around her and gave her a fairly decent twirl around the asphalt, baby and all. \u201cWho would take you for a dancer,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat was barely dancing, but you\u2019re a good sport. You\u2019re exhausted,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAs soon as you\u2019re ready, we\u2019re heading home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long day. Maybe we should find Brie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found her,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to celebrate her....\u201d</p><p>Mel followed his gaze and saw that on the other side of the asphalt dance floor, she was twirling around with Mike. \u201cWhen did he show up?\u201d she asked her husband.</p><p>\u201cJust a little while ago. He stayed in Virgin River most of the day, looking after the town while so many people were here. I think he might have come for one reason only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could work to our advantage,\u201d Mel said. \u201cHe might give her a ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give her a few minutes, and ask,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>On the other side of the asphalt, Mike held Brie closer than necessary for a little country dancing, moving her around with more skill than she showed, making her laugh. And then to his pleasure, the pace of the music slowed and so did they. He tried not to, but he was helpless and lowered his face to her neck, taking in the intoxicating fragrance of her soft hair. \u201cAh, mija,\u201d he said against her neck. He kissed her cheek, her lips. She put her palms against his cheeks and pulled him closer, opening her mouth under his, sending him reeling with desire.</p><p>\u201cMike,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019m going home tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back, stunned. He stared at her, a million questions in his eyes. \u201cWere you going to say goodbye?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI am saying goodbye,\u201d she answered. \u201cI have to spend some time with my family, and Mel and Jack need some family time\u2014without a visitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be back?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure I will, eventually.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet where I want to be. Or what I want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had tricked myself into thinking it might be here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was nothing you did or said, my love, just crazy hope. Is it all right that I call you while you\u2019re there? Maybe visit once or twice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be disappointed if you didn\u2019t. Hardly a day has gone by that we haven\u2019t talked.\u201d</p><p>He touched her hair. \u201cYou\u2019ve gained such beautiful strength while you\u2019ve been here. Your laugh is a little wilder, a little more alive. Your cheeks are flushed and charged with good health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of that has been you. Your kisses. Your tenderness. I\u2019ll miss that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it will be right here, whenever you like. Before very long, I hope. In the meantime, if you want me to come to you, all you have to do is tell me.\u201d</p><p>Jack, holding his son in his arms, interrupted them. \u201cI\u2019m going to take Mel home. Do you want to come later?\u201d he asked his sister.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, pulling out of Mike\u2019s arms. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d As Jack walked away from her, she leaned forward and, up on her toes, kissed Mike\u2019s cheek. He held her waist for a long moment, his eyes closing. But then she pulled out of his embrace and said, \u201cI\u2019ll miss you,\u201d and turned away from him to follow her brother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot nearly as much as I\u2019ll miss you,\u201d he whispered to her departing back.</p><p>Jack woke a few mornings later to the sound of David\u2019s fussing, but instead of hearing his wife\u2019s usual cooing and cajoling as she took care of his early-morning needs, he heard a very different sound. A very unpleasant sound. Retching. He sat up, found his boxers on the floor and shrugged into them. He went to his son\u2019s room and lifted him out of the crib. \u201cMorning, pardner,\u201d he said to his boy, hefting him onto the changing table to get off that all-night diaper. \u201cWhew,\u201d he said as he removed it. \u201cThat\u2019s gotta be ten pounds of pee. I don\u2019t know how you do it.\u201d He gave David\u2019s bottom a wipe, diapered him and carried him to the bathroom doorway.</p><p>Mel was kneeling in front of the toilet holding her hair back with one hand.</p> <p>With David on his hip, Jack wet a washcloth with the other hand, squeezing it out. He handed it to her. \u201cCome on, Melinda. You can\u2019t avoid it forever. We both know you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d she said, accepting the cool, wet cloth. She pressed it to her face, her brow, her neck. She didn\u2019t have any more to say.</p><p>But Jack knew. There had been tears, exhaustion, nausea. She turned watering eyes up to him. He shrugged and said, \u201cYou eased up on the breast-feeding, popped an egg and I nailed it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as if to say she did not appreciate the explanation. He held out a hand to bring her to her feet. \u201cYou have to wean David,\u201d he said. \u201cYour body can\u2019t completely nourish two children. You\u2019ll get weak. You\u2019re already exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be pregnant right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m barely over being pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Because you haven\u2019t ever been pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He thought this would probably be a bad time to tell her that he did so understand, since he had lived with a pregnant person and listened very attentively to every complaint. \u201cWe should go see John right away, so you can find out how pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you suspected?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. A few weeks. It was a little tougher this time....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, yeah. Since you haven\u2019t had a period since the first time I laid a hand on you. God, for a supposedly sterile woman, you certainly are fertile.\u201d Then he grinned, fully aware it would have got him smacked if he hadn\u2019t been holding the baby.</p><p>She whirled away from him and went to sit on their bed. She put her face in her hands and began to cry. Well, he\u2019d been expecting exactly this. There\u2019d been a lot of crying lately and he knew she was going to be mighty pissed off. He sat down beside her, put an arm around her and pulled her close. David patted her head. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not delivering this one. I want that understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry not to be cute,\u201d she said through her tears. \u201cI think my back already hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get you something? Soda? Crackers? Arsenic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d She turned her head to look at him. \u201cAre you upset?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it happened so soon. Sorry for you. I know there are times you get damned uncomfortable and I wanted you to get a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should never have gone away with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. You were already pregnant. Wanna bet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou knew before that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered why you were so emotional, and that was a possible reason. I never bought your whole sterile thing. But I don\u2019t have a problem with it. I wanted more kids. I like the idea of a larger family than the three of us. I come from a big family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will not be five, I can guarantee you that,\u201d she said. Then she bored a hole through him with her eyes. \u201cSnip, snip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to blame this on me, Mel. I suggested birth control. A couple of times, as a matter of fact. You were the one said it could never happen twice. And then explained that whole business about not ovulating while you\u2019re nursing. How\u2019s that working for you so far? Hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you,\u201d she said, not sweetly.</p><p>\u201cWell, obviously...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to understand I wasn\u2019t relying on that breast-feeding thing. I\u2019m a midwife\u2014I know that\u2019s not foolproof. I really didn\u2019t think it possible that... Shit,\u201d she said. She sighed deeply. \u201cI just barely got back into my jeans....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, those jeans. Whoa, damn. Those jeans really do it to me. No one wears a pair of jeans like you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you getting a little sick of having a fat wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fat. You\u2019re perfect. I love your body, pregnant and unpregnant. I know you\u2019re trying to get me all worked up, but I\u2019m not going there. You can try to pick a fight with me all day and I just won\u2019t play. It wouldn\u2019t be a fair fight\u2014you\u2019re out to get me and we both know it. Do you have appointments this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to go to Grace Valley for an ultrasound. I want to know when I have to have the house done.\u201d</p><p>All the way to Grace Valley, she ragged on him. She threatened him with dire consequences if he got all puffed up and studly about this. It was easy for him to take it in stride\u2014exactly how many eight-pound babies had he pushed out? And if he joked about this even once, she was going to make him pay. Perhaps for life.</p><p>Jack had some premonitions. His patience was going to be severely tested for the next several months. He was not going to be having much sex. John Stone, her OB, was going to think this was hilarious. He might have to kill John.</p><p>\u201cWell, Melinda, you little devil,\u201d John said, grinning.</p><p>She rested the back of her hand over her eyes while John and Jack studied the ultrasound, examining that little heartbeat in a barely moving mass. John pointed out small buds where arms and legs would be growing.</p><p>\u201cWhen was your last period?\u201d John asked her.</p><p>She took the hand off her eyes and glared at her husband. \u201cUm, she hasn\u2019t exactly ever had one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cThat I know of,\u201d Jack said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cA year and a half ago, all right?\u201d she said crisply. \u201cApproximately. I\u2019ve been nursing. I\u2019ve been pregnant. I\u2019ve been cast into hell and will live out my days with sore boobs and fat ankles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew. Going right for the mood swings, huh? Okay, looks like about eight weeks to me. That\u2019s an educated guess. I\u2019m thinking mid to late May. How does that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, duckie,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse my wife,\u201d Jack said. \u201cShe was counting on still being infertile. This might cause her to finally give up that illusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you if you made one joke\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelinda,\u201d Jack said, his expression stern, \u201cI was not joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would just like to know how this is possible!\u201d she ranted. \u201cDavid is like a miracle pregnancy, and before I even get him off the breast, I\u2019ve got another one cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver hear the saying, pregnancy cures infertility?\u201d John asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she said, disgusted.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about\u2014probably better than me. I guess you didn\u2019t think it would apply to you, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Jack asked John.</p><p>\u201cA lot of conditions that cause infertility are made better by pregnancy\u2014endometriosis being one. Often when you finally score that first miraculous conception, the rest follow more easily. And when you change partners, you change chemistry. You\u2019re going to want to keep these things in mind,\u201d he said. And he grinned. \u201cYou want to continue nursing?\u201d John asked Mel.</p><p>She got tears in her eyes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t quite ready to quit,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMel was going to breast-feed right up to basic training,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI thought he\u2019d be my only baby and I didn\u2019t want to rush him,\u201d she said, a tear spilling over. She got a very pathetic look on her face.</p><p>On that note, Jack leaned down and scooped her up from behind, holding her. He had a unique sense for when it would work and when it would get him smacked. Right at that moment, she needed a little human contact, support from her man.</p><p>\u201cThen how about let\u2019s evaluate your vitamin program, add some supplements and maybe you can get David down to a couple of meaningful feedings a day\u2014the ones that comfort you and him most. You\u2019d better add lots of water to your regimen\u2014you have to keep the fetus in fluids, too.\u201d John grabbed her hand. \u201cEasy does it, Mel. You\u2019re in good health, you had a very successful delivery and at one time you would have said this was the answer to your prayers. Try not to make Jack feel like shit.\u201d</p><p>That night, lying in her husband\u2019s arms, she asked, \u201cDid I make you feel like shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a little bit. It\u2019s not like I tricked you. As I recall, you were an incredibly willing accomplice.\u201d He sighed. \u201cIncredibly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just in shock. Stunned. Not quite ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Do you have any idea how gorgeous you are pregnant? You shine. There\u2019s light around you. Your eyes are brighter, your cheeks rosy, you smile and feel your belly all the time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou smile and feel my belly all the time....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m getting all this,\u201d he said wistfully. \u201cYou and a couple of kids. A few years ago I thought I\u2019d be alone the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how old you\u2019re going to be when David graduates from college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference? Does Sam look old to you? I think I can hang in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnip, snip,\u201d she said.</p><p>He rolled onto his back and looked at the ceiling. \u201cEveryone around me is in a mood,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s Preacher\u2014he\u2019s pretty prickly when it\u2019s not ovulation day, which you might have warned me about....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would have been confidential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not anymore. I think Paige might be a little put out that he told all the boys he was staying home to have sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d she asked, laughing in spite of herself.</p><p>\u201cAnd Mike is past moody. I think that\u2019s because my sister isn\u2019t here\u2014and believe me, I don\u2019t know how to take that. I want Brie to be happy. It would be nice to have Mike happy, but not if he\u2019s getting happy on Brie, if you get my drift. I\u2019m celebrating, I\u2019m celebrating,\u201d he said before she could scold him. \u201cAnd this little surprise has had an effect on your mood, if you don\u2019t mind me saying so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mind,\u201d she informed him.</p><p>\u201cI just wish things would get back to normal,\u201d he said.</p><p>And Mel thought\u2014when has anything been normal for us?</p><p>The notebook Jack had been using to make all his building calculations was getting worn and bent. He had been folding it in half to stuff into a back pocket while he worked on the house, and some of his numbers were wearing thin and faint. But he was attached to it and that was what he had out, along with his calculator and pen, while he was on the phone. He had pulled up a stool to the kitchen counter and gone down a list of general contractors, all highly recommended and all men whose work he had seen at one time or another.</p><p>Everyone, it seemed, was pretty busy. Booked.</p><p>He called Paul Haggerty in Grants Pass, Oregon. \u201cI know this is a shot in the dark, Paul, but is there any way you can help me with this? I\u2019m on a real deadline here and I can\u2019t find any general contractors or crews.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019ve you got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the house is framed, drywall is up, it\u2019s plumbed, wiring is mostly done, the roof is on\u2014and Melinda has a bun in the oven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa!

You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m great. I\u2019d have five more. But I wouldn\u2019t live to tell about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ever make you feel... You know. Old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell, no. Every time I get her pregnant, I feel about ten years younger. And if you tell her I said that, we\u2019re both gonna die.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay then, we go easy with Mel. But hey. Good for you, man.\u201d</p><p>When police officers are assigned a new area or beat, one of the first things they do is get intimate with it. Learn all the roads, houses, vehicles and people. In the city, where the population is dense, it takes a while, but eventually every yard and alley, every building and business, every suspicious character becomes part of a familiar landscape.</p><p>In the country, in the mountains, there\u2019s a lot more ground to cover, an awful lot of back roads and hidden trails, but the people, buildings and vehicles are a little more sparse. Mike spent as much as a few hours every day driving and hiking the countryside surrounding Virgin River and the neighboring towns. He made frequent runs by the old rest stop, but nothing much seemed to have changed there\u2014he\u2019d expect to see a lot of trash if the place had been used recently for a party.</p><p>As he roamed closer to the countryside and mountains surrounding Clear River he saw a couple of structures he chose not to get too close to\u2014one appeared to be a very small prefab house and the other a storage shed. Both had recent tire tracks leading to them\u2014off-road vehicle tracks, probably quads or Jeeps. Neither was in plain sight, though it wasn\u2019t certain they were hidden in the trees and growth; it could be the owner\u2019s preference to be unobtrusive. But on the chance one or both were illegal grows, he kept his distance\u2014sometimes such enterprises were booby-trapped. And besides wanting to know what was out there, this wasn\u2019t really his business. It was all just part of knowing the lay of the land, and it was lonely work.</p><p>There was a lot of interesting signage out this way. No Trespassing and No Hunting were pretty common, but now and then he\u2019d see Trespassers Will Be Shot, Guard Dogs Patrolling and Hunters Will Be Hunted. They didn\u2019t sell such signs at the hardware store\u2014they were hand stenciled or spray painted. One sign that said Firearms Prohibited In This Area was riddled with buckshot.</p><p>Quite often he ended up at the place he\u2019d begun to think of as Whispering Rock, the place he\u2019d shared with Brie last spring. He\u2019d park his SUV upstream and walk along the riverbank. From time to time there\u2019d be a fisherman or two, though the water here was too shallow for a good catch. He\u2019d seen a young couple sharing a blanket on the ground, doing what appeared to be homework. When he\u2019d walked into the clearing they\u2019d looked up in surprise, maybe a little nervous by his sudden presence\u2014so he\u2019d smiled, waved and walked back upriver, leaving them alone.</p><p>He liked to be there in the late afternoon when the sun was shining. He could almost see Brie leaning against that big boulder, eyes drifting closed, smiling her secret smile. He stayed a little later than usual one day, through the setting of the sun. He\u2019d just been thinking how nuts it was to do that without a flashlight when he heard a car engine. He assumed it would be young lovers, for this was not a place to be in the dark\u2014there were no lights and it was far off the main road. Before he could be seen, he started up the river, back toward his vehicle. Something made him stop; the car had pulled into the clearing, the lights remained on, but he didn\u2019t hear the sound of a car door. He stood and just listened for a moment. Young lovers would kill the lights. What other business was there at this isolated bend in the river, after dark?</p><p>He waited; the engine continued to run, the lights shone. Mike walked the short distance back to that spot, looked through the trees and saw the form of a single man inside the truck. Waiting. Now his curiosity was stirred and he watched.</p><p>It was probably ten minutes before a second vehicle pulled up to the clearing, another truck. The engines of both vehicles remained on, headlights illuminating the clearing, but when the second vehicle arrived, one man emerged from each truck.</p><p>Then it got interesting. From the first truck stepped Detective Delaney and from the second, a man Mike recognized as a well-known illegal grower. He was a big guy, just over six feet, and wore his signature Shady Brady hat. Over the past year Mike, Jack and Preacher had all had a little unexpected traffic with him. The first time was before Mike got to Virgin River\u2014the man took Mel out to an illegal grow to deliver a baby. Most recently, the man showed them where to find Paige when her abusive ex-husband abducted her; it was very probable the guy had saved her life. He was an enigma\u2014clearly a criminal, but apparently with a humanitarian side.</p><p>The men faced each other; Delaney leaned on the hood of his truck, and the grower kept his hands in his pockets. They didn\u2019t shake hands or greet each other as friends, and no money or goods changed hands\u2014it was not a drug buy. In less than five minutes they got back into their respective trucks and left the area.</p><p>There were a number of possibilities, but the most likely was that Delaney had himself an informant inside the cannabis trade.</p><p>Nine</p><p>Paul Haggerty would help Jack anytime he could\u2014that went without saying. It being a profitable venture for him as well made it even more palatable. But when he got right down to it, the deal maker was the fact that Vanessa was now residing in Virgin River.</p><p>He found six men who were ready to sign on immediately, so he had a contract drawn up for Jack and faxed it to the bar. Next he leased a large mobile home and had it delivered to the homesite, along with a portable toilet and commercial Dumpster for the grounds. His crew could drive down and sleep in the trailer during the week, going home weekends if they so chose. He\u2019d haul his own small trailer for himself. He\u2019d change out and add crews as progress was made on the house. Jack would have to double as a foreman because Paul couldn\u2019t stay in Virgin River all the time. He was leaving his dad and two brothers to run their construction company while he took on this project and he\u2019d have to spend some time back in Grants Pass trying to pull his own weight.</p><p>While the structure was being completed, Paul would scout around the area for painters, carpet layers, tilers, paperhangers, cabinetmakers. Jack would have no trouble having light and plumbing fixtures and appliances installed, once Mel chose them. The house had been started last spring and great progress had been made, but alone, it would take Jack another year. Together, with crews, they might be able to finish it in a few months. If the weather didn\u2019t hamper them too much, by early spring at least.</p><p>And during that time he would see Vanessa. The idea threatened to give him hives. He loved being around her, went nuts with her effervescence and buoyancy. The problem was that he found her just as sexy and distracting pregnant as he had that very first night Matt put the moves on her. He wondered if he was just setting himself up for a lot of long, troubling nights of thinking about her and feeling sorry for himself because he would never, under pain of death, touch his friend\u2019s woman. He felt guilty that he even wanted to.</p><p>But this would be his secret, that he desired her, worshipped her. And while Matt was at war, Paul would look in on her from time to time, be sure she was holding up.</p><p>He and Matt were like brothers. They had gone to the same Oregon high school, had a couple of years of college together, joined up and went into the Corps together. But Matt was the one who was confident with the girls, while Paul had always been the reluctant one, a little shy. It was hard for him to make that first move; he\u2019d always had to think it through for a long time before he could work up to approaching a woman. He\u2019d overcome a lot of that by now, but not enough. He\u2019d never have the speed, finesse and confidence of his best friend.</p><p>He remembered that night just a few years ago as if it was yesterday. Matt was on leave and they met in San Francisco to do the town. They were out drinking when they spotted a group of flight attendants on layover at one of the bars. Paul had said, \u201cOh, my God, would you look at that! Would you look at her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Matt asked.</p><p>\u201cThe leggy one with the red hair and gold skin. I\u2019m going to pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get her for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! God, don\u2019t do that. Wait till I figure out something....\u201d</p><p>And Matt grinned and said, \u201cThree, two, one... I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t bring her back. Instead, he waved Paul over and tried to hook him up with one of Vanessa\u2019s friends. And Paul went along with it, because what else was he going to do? If he\u2019d had an ounce of courage he would\u2019ve said, \u201cStop! I saw her first! She\u2019s mine!\u201d To this day, he regretted that.</p><p>Before that weekend was over, Matt and Vanessa were in love. Since she had airline travel privileges and he was state-side, she spent every weekend with him for a year. A year after that Paul was best man at their wedding. He swore if he ever again saw a woman he was that drawn to, he would tackle her on the spot, probably knocking her off her feet, and never let her get away.</p><p>As far as he could remember, that hadn\u2019t ever happened to him before. And it sure hadn\u2019t happened since.</p><p>When Paul got to Virgin River he went directly to the job site to be sure everything was in place. The trailer had made it just fine and stood ready for his crews. His best supervisor, Manny, would be bringing materials on the big truck and the others would follow. He unhooked his fifth wheel, leaving it at the site, and drove his truck to the Booth household. When he pulled in, he immediately had second thoughts\u2014he should have called her. But wouldn\u2019t calling her indicate that she had some play in his coming here, doing this for Jack? That wouldn\u2019t be good. So he just knocked on the door.</p><p>Walt answered, his glasses pushed up on his head and his newspaper in his hand. \u201cPaul! Damn, boy! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here on a job, sir,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to keep it on the downlow for now\u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat so?\u201d he asked, pushing open the door. \u201cCome in, come in! You can tell us all about it. Vanessa! You won\u2019t believe this!\u201d</p><p>Paul stepped into the foyer of the house and looked around appreciatively. It wasn\u2019t much from the outside\u2014just a long, narrow ranch. But inside it was spacious with vaulted ceilings and lots of windows facing the stable and corral so they could watch their horses from the house. It looked as though the general had probably gutted it and had it completely remodeled. The foyer opened up into a great room with an impressive fireplace and lots of soft leather furniture. As Paul stepped into that room he saw that the dining room was to his right and he leaned slightly to peek into a huge modern kitchen. Down the hall, he assumed, were bedrooms. Out the great-room windows he could see horses in the pasture, the new stable and a view of the mountains and river. It wasn\u2019t hard to tell why the general had chosen this place. He was a hunter, fisherman and sportsman who loved his horses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Out back, a foot up on the corral fence, looking at the horses, was a young man. That would be Tommy. He couldn\u2019t wait to get a closer look at the kid. At the wedding a couple of years ago he\u2019d really enjoyed his sense of humor. He was an intelligent, handsome teen who was funny but with the kind of careful manners that would come from being raised in a strict household, by an Army general\u2019s firm hand.</p><p>Vanessa came down the hall toward him. Her face lit up in pleased surprise. \u201cOh, my God!\u201d she said, grinning widely. \u201cWhat are you doing back here so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you in a minute. How are you? You look fantastic!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to get really fat,\u201d she laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou look perfect. I think you\u2019re more beautiful than ever. Are you taking lots of pictures for Matt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery week I have Dad take a new picture of my belly. Time-lapse photography.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a beer, Paul?\u201d Walt asked.</p> <p>\u201cSure, why not? Is that Tommy out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s having a bad day. Let me get that beer. Go sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Vanessa said, taking his hand and pulling him into the great room. She led him to an overstuffed chair with an ottoman near the windows that overlooked the corral.</p><p>Before Paul even got comfortable in the chair opposite Vanessa, the general appeared with a cold beer poured in a tall glass. He had one for himself as well and said, \u201cVanni, I didn\u2019t get you anything, honey. I didn\u2019t even think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Dad. I\u2019ll go get some water in a minute. Boy, doesn\u2019t that beer look good! I have to admit\u2014I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>The general was at least six feet tall, broad shouldered and silver haired, with black brows, square face, about sixty years old; he had had a magnificent Army career that spanned over thirty-five years. A few years ago his wife had died, and when that happened he wrapped it up with the Army. Without that great partner of his\u2014a woman lauded often but whom Paul had never met\u2014he wasn\u2019t interested in any more military challenges.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with Tommy?\u201d Paul asked, taking a drink of his beer.</p><p>\u201cAw, teenagers,\u201d the general said. \u201cHe\u2019s hanging with this kid I just don\u2019t like. He got himself in a little trouble\u2014went out to some forbidden kegger in the woods. I found out there\u2019s been a little beer after school and noticed his grades slipping in a couple of his classes. And I think it\u2019s this one kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all of it. Dad doesn\u2019t like his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>The general shook his head. \u201cThis kid, he\u2019s got that shifty look, that manipulative little grin. I mean, we were all seventeen, right? Had a couple of beers, drove our cars too fast, tried to pick up girls? Huh? But this one\u2019s different. I think he\u2019s a little fucker, and I don\u2019t want him fucking with my kid. Sorry, Vanni.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWell, that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever heard those provocative words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can just tell,\u201d the general said.</p><p>Paul thought, he probably just can. The general had spent an awful lot of years looking at the faces of young soldiers and he\u2019d learned to read them pretty well. He kind of nodded to the general. \u201cSo? You ground him or something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s grounded, but I told him I want him to make better friends, because if he lies to me again, he\u2019s history. I\u2019ll send him to another school\u2014a private school. I thought this place would be quiet\u2014the kids would be docile. I think they\u2019re wilder than the city kids. At least, this one he\u2019s been running with. This kid\u2019s a bad influence. Now, never mind our family troubles\u2014what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Paul looked at Vanni and said, \u201cI told your dad we have to keep this quiet until I understand how much of this is out\u2014but I\u2019m here to help Jack finish his house. I rounded up a crew, installed a trailer out on his homesite and we\u2019re going to try to get it done as quickly as possible. Because your midwife is pregnant\u2014they need more room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy intel says she\u2019s very annoyed by this development\u2014she wasn\u2019t quite ready for another one yet. So Jack, being the Prince Charming of a husband he is, is paying all my boys overtime to get that house finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw. That\u2019s sweet. Are you saying the pregnancy hasn\u2019t been announced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I don\u2019t want to be the one to announce it. So let\u2019s not say anything. And I don\u2019t know if she knows what Jack has done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where are you staying while you\u2019re in town?\u201d she asked. \u201cWon\u2019t she wonder why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure Jack\u2019s going to tell her about my crew real quick because, as I understand it, she goes out to the site fairly often just to look around. She\u2019s going to notice the people, the trailer\u2014and I brought down my fifth wheel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said. \u201cStay here! With us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d the general said. \u201cWe have lots of room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d he protested. \u201cI\u2019ll be coming and going, my hours will be weird, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll spend some time with Jack and Preacher in town....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares about that? Come and go as you like! We\u2019ll just fix you up with a key.\u201d She laughed. \u201cNot that anyone remembers to lock a door around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to commute\u2014I left my brothers with the company in Grants Pass. I\u2019ll be going back and forth, but honestly, it\u2019s going to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand to think of you in a fifth wheel for weeks\u2014and I don\u2019t care what kind of hours you keep!\u201d Vanessa protested.</p><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, Paul, I could use a hand,\u201d Walt said. \u201cI\u2019m making a run down to Bodega Bay almost every week for a couple of days. Every other week at least. Do you remember Vanessa\u2019s cousin Shelby, from the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, sitting up straighter.</p><p>\u201cHer mother, my sister...she\u2019s disabled. Bedridden now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir\u2014I had forgotten. ALS, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Frankly, none of us expected her to last this long, but she\u2019s still with us. The bravest soul I\u2019ve ever known. But since I can\u2019t convince Shelby she\u2019d be just as well off in a nursing home, I go as often as I can. To help, to visit. To offer moral support. Vanni goes now and then, as well. It sure would ease my mind if there were someone around here to keep an eye on things when I have to be gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on Tom, he means,\u201d Vanessa said. Then she grinned. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d prefer your mothering to mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny way I can help, sir,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI\u2019m awful sorry about your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u2014she\u2019s not in any pain. The hardest part about this is that my niece has taken it on, full-time, and she\u2019s just a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby\u2019s doing exactly what she wants to do,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cShe\u2019s very stubborn about it. If it were my mother, I\u2019d do the same as my cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can work out our schedules, General,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIf you make your trip down the coast while I\u2019m working on the house and not back in Oregon, I\u2019d be glad to hang around here. Make sure no one\u2019s going wild.\u201d He smiled, but inside his pulse picked up a bit. Being under Vanessa\u2019s roof while her father was away wasn\u2019t going to do much for sleeping soundly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Paul,\u201d Walt said.</p><p>Paul thought, if I were a good man, I wouldn\u2019t be having these thoughts, these feelings.</p><p>Jack showed up at Doc\u2019s at about eleven in the morning and found Mel at the computer, David in his playpen not far away. \u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m scheduling our mammogram unit to visit town. What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something to show you\u2014if you can take a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you be surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so bad at surprises,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know. You should work on that. Where\u2019s Doc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s around here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, find him and tell him you\u2019re stepping out. I\u2019ll get David. Let\u2019s take a ride. I think you\u2019re going to like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she said, standing up, \u201cI hate when you do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t given you one bad surprise yet,\u201d he said, lifting his son out of the playpen. When she glared at him he said, \u201cI haven\u2019t! I make excellent babies and if you\u2019re surprised, I think that\u2019s your fault!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you don\u2019t have to rub my nose in it.\u201d</p><p>It took Mel only a few minutes to get herself together, find Doc to excuse herself, grab her medical bag, which went with her everywhere, and shrug into her coat. Jack put David in his car seat\u2014he was delighted to be going somewhere. Anywhere.</p><p>When they were turning off the road onto the drive that had become her drive, to her new home, she got a little keyed up. Happy, if you dared. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWait till you see. You\u2019re going to like this. You\u2019re going to like me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you\u2014I\u2019m just not thrilled about how potent you seem to be.\u201d</p><p>As Jack pulled up to the top of the hill, coming through the trees, she sat up straighter when she saw all the activity around the house. It was a full-fledged construction site, complete with trailers, vehicles, portable toilet, men at work. Right in front of the largest trailer, wearing a hard hat, she recognized Paul.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting your house done, Melinda. Paul brought a crew down from Oregon and we\u2019re finishing up. We\u2019re going to have to go over to Eureka to pick out our fixtures, paint, carpet, tile, cabinets. It\u2019s going to go fast now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she said in a breath, turning toward him. She put her hand over his.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get you in and settled before the baby. I\u2019m going to do everything I can to make this easy for you.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIf I could carry the baby for you, I would.\u201d He grinned. \u201cThank God I can\u2019t. But after this little one is born, I\u2019m going to do whatever I have to do to be sure you have time to enjoy your kids. We\u2019ll try my method of birth control instead of yours next time. I miss your joy. Your smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smile,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been pretty cranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2019m sorry, darling. It\u2019s not you.... It\u2019s me. I feel like an idiot. I feel like one of those teenage girls who come to me already five months pregnant without a clue because they didn\u2019t want it to be so. It\u2019s pretty embarrassing, given my profession. I really, really thought David was a miracle, and the only miracle I\u2019d have. People like me shouldn\u2019t have that kind of denial. I don\u2019t know what possessed me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how much I love you? Mel, I\u2019d never do anything to hurt you, make you uncomfortable.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI just can\u2019t keep my hands off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Jack,\u201d she said. \u201cThe hell of it is, I can\u2019t resist you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014the only problem we have is that you\u2019re way more fertile than you thought. We can work with that. Kiss me.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over to him and put a hand around the back of his neck, pulling him against her mouth, which she opened passionately, treating him to one of her lustiest kisses. He put his arms around her and moaned appreciatively. Kiss at an end, he said, \u201cNow, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. You just taste so good. Come on, let\u2019s go see what Paul\u2019s got going on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mel got out while Jack pulled David out of his car seat. The second Paul saw them getting out of the truck, he came to them, opening his arms to Mel, hugging her close. \u201cWhat do you think? Your man make you happy today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2014this is wonderful of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m not wonderful\u2014he\u2019s paying through the nose. But it\u2019s going to be beautiful, Mel. I guarantee it. You have work to do, too\u2014you have to appliance and accessory shop right away. Some things take a long time to be delivered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get right on it. Will you stay with us while you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had nothing but offers, and I\u2019ve got my trailer. Which, believe it or not, I happen to like. I think when I\u2019m not out here with the boys or back in Grants Pass, I\u2019ll be spending some time at the general\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick a night this week to have you, Vanessa and her family and all your guys for dinner at the bar. Right, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it. Anything you want.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI like it when he says that. Did he happen to tell you the news?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d Paul asked dumbly.</p><p>She gave him a playful whack on the arm. \u201cStop it\u2014I know you know. It\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He put an arm around her shoulders. \u201cIf I know, it\u2019s because you\u2019re glowing. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m pea-green until about nine in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight after which, she glows,\u201d Jack agreed.</p><p>\u201cNothing more beautiful than a pregnant woman,\u201d Paul said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou do good work,\u201d Paul said to Jack.</p><p>\u201cYeah... And if I ever find out who gave her those shoes...\u201d Jack added with a laugh, which earned him a dirty look that amused both men beyond good sense.</p><p>The mammogram RV showed up in Virgin River on a Monday morning and was set up in Doc\u2019s clinic. All the women Mel had contacted came in early in a big crowd, some dragging kids along and all bearing food and drink. They gathered in the waiting room and held an all-day party, leaving one at a time for their mammograms. It was a long, exhausting and fulfilling day for Mel, and for Doc, too\u2014if you looked closely enough his grimace almost looked like a smile.</p><p>The next day the truck went to Grace Valley to June Hudson\u2019s clinic, where mammograms were provided for those women over forty and younger women who were at a high risk for breast cancer.</p><p>The following day was appointment day and Mel had three prenatals\u2014the third being Vanessa Rutledge.</p><p>Mel wasn\u2019t surprised her first two patients favored home births even though a hospital and epidural were available to them\u2014they came from rural families that had been having home births for generations. But the one who really surprised her was Vanessa, who was by all accounts a city girl. She planned to have her baby in her father\u2019s house, naturally. \u201cJust three months to go,\u201d Mel told her. \u201cAnd you\u2019re in absolutely perfect health. Now, how about a little trip to Grace Valley for an ultrasound? We should be sure right now that we don\u2019t have any obvious complications. Do you want to know the sex of the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great\u2014then I can tell Matt. He feels so left out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about next week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything on my schedule,\u201d she said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cIt must be hard, having him so far away when you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, but this seems to be the history in the Booth family. My dad wasn\u2019t around for either me or my brother\u2019s births. The military can really screw up the best of plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t Jack in the Marine Corps for twenty?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>\u201cA little over twenty\u2014but I didn\u2019t find him until recently. I came up here from L.A. to work with Doc Mullins when I met and married Jack. He was already retired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you had a baby right away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy, howdy,\u201d Mel said. She touched her still-flat tummy. \u201cAnd guess what? He got me again.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to put him in that little guesthouse out back.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa laughed at her. \u201cListen, there\u2019s something pretty special going on at our house tomorrow night\u2014and we\u2019d like you and Jack, Preacher, Paige and Mike to all be there if possible. Of course, Paul will be there, too. My dad got us signed up for some kind of program called \u2018Voices From Home.\u2019 We\u2019re going to get an Internet call from Matt\u2014real time, video cam from Baghdad. We\u2019ll make a party of it\u2014and after we all get a chance to talk, we\u2019ll have a big dinner. Can you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa,\u201d she said, touching her hand, \u201cdon\u2019t you want him all to yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a part of me that does, but I\u2019m thinking of Matt\u2014he\u2019s all the way over there and right here are some of his favorite people. You have no idea how much he talked about Jack, Preacher and Mike. And it will be almost as big a deal for him to talk to Paul as to me. I\u2019m going to walk across the street right after leaving here to ask the boys. Say you\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely sure, honey? Because it\u2019s understandable if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure! I just wish I knew the sex of the baby for that video conference. That would really top it off.\u201d</p><p>Mel smiled. \u201cWell, girlfriend, I can hook you up. I have some connections. Can you drive over today or tomorrow morning?\u201d</p><p>Her face lit up. \u201cI can! Can you really make that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. It\u2019s the least we can do for you.\u201d</p><p>On the day of the video conference with Matt, Tommy was on his way to his truck in the high school parking lot when Jordan snagged his arm. \u201cHey, man, where you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been around,\u201d he said, not very happily. He\u2019d been avoiding Jordan. After what Brenda had said about those rest-stop parties, he\u2019d been curious. So he\u2019d dropped in on one when she had other plans with a girlfriend. It was, as she had said, pretty out of control. There weren\u2019t too many kids and the weather was cold, but stuff had been going on that he didn\u2019t like. Jordan and his buddy seemed to be taking kids away from the crowd briefly; he couldn\u2019t see what was happening, but they weren\u2019t gone long enough to smoke a joint and there was a little too much delight in their expressions when they returned. He suspected some kind of score. Ecstasy, he thought. Or something a little more high-powered, like meth.</p><p>Tommy had a beer, headed for home...and his dad had waited up for him, smelled his breath. And he was in trouble.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you. Wanna come by the house? We got beer, we got fun times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m not into that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I took a run out to your little party at the rest stop and got into trouble with my old man. I gotta go\u2014I got something going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your deal? You cut me off like that without saying anything? I know a girl I want you to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a girl, Jordan. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. What girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been seeing someone. A junior. Girl named Brenda. We\u2019ve been out. And stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenda? Carpenter?\u201d he said, his eyes lighting up. \u201cYeah, I know Brenda.\u201d He waved his hand in front of his face as if to cool a sudden fever. \u201cI know Brenda real good. Real, real good.\u201d</p><p>Tommy\u2019s expression closed off. Dark. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughed. \u201cOh, yeah. She\u2019s a hottie. A real hottie.\u201d</p><p>Tom went instantly unconscious. Brain dead. Steam started to pour out of his ears. He moved on Jordan, getting in his face. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, man. It was a long time ago. No big deal. We partied together a little bit.\u201d</p><p>Tommy grabbed him by the shirtfront. \u201cNo. You didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d</p><p>Tommy drew back and landed a blow to his face, knocking him down. But Jordan sprang right back up and delivered his own blow, surprisingly hard for the skinny runt he was. And it was game on. They were hitting, rolling around, crunching, swearing\u2014and then they were pulled apart by two teachers.</p><p>In the principal\u2019s office Tommy admitted immediately what had set him off and Jordan confessed as fast that he\u2019d just been mouthing off and it wasn\u2019t true. That was one thing about the country as opposed to the city\u2014they kind of expected you to handle something like that with a punch or two. The principal said to Jordan, \u201cSounds like you were just asking for it, son. If you\u2019d said that to me about my girl, I\u2019d have given you a lot worse than what you got. Now I want you boys to stay away from each other, because if this happens again, you\u2019re both suspended.\u201d</p><p>The problem was, it took a long time to get to that point and Tommy wanted to get home. He didn\u2019t want to miss a chance to talk to Matt.</p><p>There was a definite air of excitement at the Booth household as the hour for the contact through the Internet approached. The general had moved the computer into the living room with a camera installed above the screen. For this special night he had purchased a larger, flat-screen monitor, as an image of Matt\u2019s face would be projected onto the screen, just as the faces of the people who talked to him would be videoed to him for the conference. Vanessa was running around nervously, worrying about her hair and makeup, while Jack and Mike went immediately to the kitchen to help the general serve up drinks and hors d\u2019oeuvres. Jack\u2019s bar had been closed for this event and Paige and Mel spent all their time trying to reassure Vanessa that she\u2019d never been more beautiful. Preacher held Christopher on his lap, keeping him under control at this gathering while David slept peacefully in the playpen in a bedroom down the hall.</p><p>As the time for the contact approached and the general got the computer online, tension rose about tenfold in the house. Long, stressful minutes passed as the time for the video conference came and went. And then, suddenly, a voice rang out in the room. \u201cHey! Anybody home?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa rushed forward. She was momentarily speechless, staring at the face of her husband on the screen. Her hand reached out toward him.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he said again. \u201cVanni? You there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt,\u201d she said, too softly. Then, turning on the camera and pulling herself up internally, louder, \u201cMatt! Darling!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Vanni\u2014look at you! Let me see it\u2014your belly.\u201d</p><p>She turned sideways in front of the small camera.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Vanni! You\u2019re getting big! You\u2019re growing me a great big baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, I have so many surprises for you. First of all, I just found out this morning, it\u2019s a boy. A son, Matt!\u201d</p><p>There was deafening quiet. \u201cAw, Vanni!\u201d he said in an emotional breath. \u201cI love you, baby. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Matt! Are you okay? Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, Vanni, it\u2019s all good. We\u2019re working hard, but that\u2019s what we came here for. It won\u2019t be too much longer. You\u2019re beautiful, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you lost weight?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cBaby, everyone loses weight over here. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to have any trouble putting it back on. I just can\u2019t wait to hold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too, Matt. By the time you get home, you can hold both of us. You should be thinking of a name, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. How are you doing there? You feeling okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel great, darling. And I have more surprises for you. Guess who\u2019s here. Jack, Preacher, Mike\u2014come over here!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One at a time they put their faces in the line of the camera. \u201cHoo-rah,\u201d Jack said, grinning.

You must not have to work for a living, you look so good! God, I\u2019m glad Vanni\u2019s there\u2014I told her she\u2019d love it there! How\u2019s the general doing? You looking out for him?\u201d</p><p>Walt pushed his way in. \u201cWho says I need looking out for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, man! How you doing, sir? You watching over your grandbaby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the time you get home, I\u2019ll have him standing at attention!\u201d</p><p>Matt laughed, clearly enjoying the small reunion. \u201cTommy around?\u201d Matt asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s late, Matt. I can\u2019t imagine why\u2014he\u2019s been looking forward to this. There\u2019s someone else here,\u201d Walt said, pulling Paul into the frame.</p><p>\u201cHaggerty! What the hell? What are you doing there?\u201d Matt asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m finishing up Jack\u2019s new house for him. He\u2019s got a kid and another one on the way....\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s got a kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, can you think of anything crazier? He needed some help. How\u2019s it going over there, bud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, it sucks. Big surprise, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou making any progress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow, miserable progress. You going to be around there a while?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCouple of months maybe, on and off. But I\u2019m never very far away, you know that. When you get back here, I\u2019ll just come\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Paul... Buddy... Listen, if anything happens...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t talk that way, come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, if anything goes wrong, you look after Vanni, huh? I think she always liked you best anyway.\u201d Then he laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re going to kick some ass here, don\u2019t you worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried. Hey, we don\u2019t want to steal this time from your wife. We\u2019re going to step out, leave the two of you alone, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, buddy. Paul? Buddy? Hey, you know I love you, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoo-rah,\u201d Paul said. \u201cYou hang in there. Give \u2019em hell! Vanni\u2014get back here,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>And like an exodus, everyone left the great room for the kitchen so that Vanessa and Matt could have what was left of the air time alone. From the kitchen they could hear the voices in the background. Walt quietly passed out drinks while they whispered. \u201cHe looks good,\u201d Jack said.</p> <p>\u201cFor a jarhead,\u201d the general joked. \u201cTommy was supposed to be here. Late again.\u201d Then to Mel he said, \u201cThat was perfect, what you did. Getting the ultrasound before this video conference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t have anything like this when I served,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cThis is good, this Internet conference. Too bad they can\u2019t talk every day or every week.\u201d He draped an arm around Paige\u2019s shoulders, pulling her near. Clearly he wouldn\u2019t be able to bear being away from her, separated like Matt and Vanessa.</p><p>After a few minutes had passed, there were no more voices coming from the other room. Paul had seemed to be on alert and it was he who first poked his head around the corner. The screen was dark and Vanessa sat in front of it with her head lowered to her folded arms, crying.</p><p>Paul approached her. \u201cVanni, come on, Vanni,\u201d he said, down on one knee, his arms enfolding her. She turned in his arms and with her head on his shoulder, she just wept. \u201cOh, honey, that was hard, wasn\u2019t it? But he\u2019s okay\u2014you saw that! He\u2019s tough, Vanni. He\u2019s going to be fine. He\u2019ll be home before you know it.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and met Paul\u2019s eyes. \u201cAt least I held it together while he was online,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did good. Come on,\u201d he said, pulling her to her feet. \u201cLet\u2019s get your face washed. I don\u2019t want you all upset. We don\u2019t want to get the little critter upset. Come on,\u201d he said, arm around her shoulders, leading her away from the computer, down the hall toward the bathroom.</p><p>Walt was the next one out of the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to take her a few minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew the whole thing would be good and bad all at the same time. But with all of you here, she\u2019ll come around quicker, enjoy herself, have some good feelings just from seeing him again, seeing he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>The front door crashed open and Tommy rushed in. \u201cDid I make it?\u201d he asked, eyeing the gathering.</p><p>\u201cYou missed it, son. Where\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, man, I\u2019m sorry, Dad. I tried to get back....\u201d</p><p>Walt walked toward his son, frowning. The boy was as tall as his dad, though leaner. He had a split lip and some dirt on his clothes. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? You\u2019ve been fighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cMaybe a little bit. Dad, I\u2019m sorry I missed him. I\u2019ll explain later, but I promise, I\u2019m not going to let you down again. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me one thing\u2014did this have anything to do with Jordan Whitley?\u201d</p><p>Tommy grinned. \u201cYeah. And he looks worse than me. I\u2019m through with him, Dad. Honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s something, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Paul was spending a few nights at the general\u2019s house following the video conference while Walt was in Bodega Bay, and he decided to do little big-brothering. He found Tommy in the stable, mucking the stalls. \u201cHey, pal,\u201d he said. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying out of the kitchen. Believe me, Vanessa doesn\u2019t want my attempts at food preparation. I was wondering something...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to pry, so you tell me if it\u2019s none of my business. You having any trouble at school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the kind that gets you into fights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that. What did my dad tell you?\u201d</p><p>Paul shrugged. \u201cHe said you were hanging with a guy he didn\u2019t like. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe second he saw him, it was instant hate, and I don\u2019t have that one figured out yet. I don\u2019t know how you can take one look at a guy and know he\u2019s an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the general has looked at a lot of young guys over the years. Did he turn out to be right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tommy said with a grin, then touched his split lip in sudden pain. \u201cDon\u2019t tell him I said that. He already thinks he knows everything.\u201d</p><p>Paul returned the grin. \u201cYour secret\u2019s safe with me, pal. How\u2019d you get hooked up with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew-kid syndrome,\u201d Tommy said, leaning his shovel against the wall of the stall. \u201cI got here too late in the summer for football and didn\u2019t have anything better to do. I thought he was a little weird, but you know\u2014he always managed to have a couple of beers or a place lined up for a party.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou know how it goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Paul said, though his senior year had been pretty tame. \u201cSo what kind of an asshole did he turn out to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual kind. He\u2019s a liar. Likes to brag about the girls he\u2019s nailed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLot of that going around the locker room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always learned a real man doesn\u2019t brag about it. Plus, I don\u2019t have anything to brag about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shame in that, Tommy. This is a good time to be real careful, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what you mean, Paul,\u201d he said, smiling more cautiously. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. My dad has had this talk with me a hundred or so times. But Jordan really pissed me off good\u2014he was talking about a girl I\u2019ve been dating. I\u2019ve only been out with her a few times, and there\u2019s school and homework at her house, and she\u2019s a nice girl. A good girl, you know? She moves real, real slow. The way that asshole talked, it was like he was saying he\u2019d done her. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d even get to hold her hand. I had to slug him. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d Paul said. \u201cYou finished with him now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Every time I see his face, I just want to mess it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going with the girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good. You should see her\u2014she\u2019s beautiful. And you would never believe how smart she is. I think she kind of likes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprises the hell out of me,\u201d Tom said, glancing away.</p><p>Paul laughed at his modesty. He was already six feet tall with some good-sized shoulders and arms on him from playing sports and taking care of a stable and four horses every day. Tossing around heavy bales of hay was better than lifting weights. \u201cHey, you have any time on your hands? Any need to make money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could always use a little money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, if you\u2019re gonna date beautiful girls, you need money.\u201d Paul laughed again. \u201cThere\u2019s work out at the job site, if you\u2019re interested. It\u2019s dirty and it\u2019s hard\u2014clean up around the site. But Jack\u2019s paying overtime. I could give you a few hours after school or on weekends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d Tom said, smiling.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Brie\u2019s routine in Sacramento lacked challenge, but she still had no desire to go back to the prosecutor\u2019s office. All she did was exercise every morning, clean up her dad\u2019s house and cook dinner for the two of them. She read when she was relaxed and could focus\u2014not law text or nonfiction, but escapist novels. Finally there were a few places around town she was comfortable going to\u2014if only in the light of day. She felt safe at the grocery store and the women\u2019s gym, but not the library; those narrow aisles of tightly packed books gave her claustrophobia. So she bought her books online and had them delivered. There was still enough anxiety in her that she even varied the time of morning she went to the gym for her workout, conscious that criminals who watched their victims studied their habits to use against them.</p><p>She went to her sisters\u2019 homes and sometimes the girls would come to Sam\u2019s. Sunday dinners with the whole family at Sam\u2019s were pretty typical. Everyone had noticed that even if Brie\u2019s routine hadn\u2019t changed much, her mood had. She was lighter of spirit; she smiled and laughed more easily.</p><p>\u201cI think Virgin River gets you right,\u201d her oldest sister, Donna, observed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve gone there after a crisis and come home better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the town,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not Jack.\u201d When she\u2019d gone to Virgin River after the trial and David\u2019s birth, she\u2019d been empty inside. Hollow. A brand-new divorc\u00e9e having just lost the biggest trial of her career, she\u2019d felt as if she was nothing. A zero, a nonperson; a woman who couldn\u2019t hold her man, a lawyer who couldn\u2019t win her case. But a picnic, a little wedding dancing, some flirting, and she\u2019d begun to feel female again. Then the rape had set her back a year; she was broken in a million pieces. But some phone calls and lunches, some strong arms around her and lips on hers, and she\u2019d started to feel like a woman. In fact, that was the only place she felt like a woman and not a victim\u2014in his arms.</p><p>Since being back in Sacramento Brie had seen Mike only twice in several weeks\u2014Santa Rosa lunches, holding hands across the table. There were long, deep, wonderful kisses at parting. She talked to him almost every evening, taking the call in her room, and for about an hour they would share the events of the day. He caught her up on all the news, from the video conference at the general\u2019s to who\u2019d been at Jack\u2019s for dinner. She was amazed by how hungry she was for every tiny piece of information about that little town. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then as the conversation would draw near its end, their voices would grow lower and softer and their words more intense. \u201cI miss you, mija,\u201d he would say, his voice husky. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until you threaten me with a broken heart again. I think you\u2019re all talk and you\u2019ve lost interest in my heart.\u201d</p><p>And she would say, \u201cNot at all\u2014breaking your heart is still a huge priority with me. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot soon enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI miss your kisses,\u201d she told him.</p><p>And he said, \u201cTe tengo en mis brazos.\u201d I will hold you in my arms. \u201cTe querido m\u00e1s te de lo tu hubieras.\u201d I have wanted you for longer than you know. \u201cI will kiss you as much as you allow,\u201d he translated incorrectly. It sent shivers through her.</p><p>November arrived, bringing crisp days and cold nights to the Sacramento valley, and she heard on the news that snow had fallen in the mountains. The pass from Red Bluff through the Trinity Alps to Virgin River could be closed now and any trip made to that part of the country would have to go from Sacramento to Ukiah and up the Mendocino valley. Just as well\u2014highway 36 was treacherous and slow even in the best weather, but it was spectacular. Brie spent a lot of time thinking about which route she would take when she eventually decided it was time to return to Virgin River.</p><p>She told her sisters about him, but only one at a time, and sometimes in hushed tones that she knew became a little breathless. \u201cHe speaks to me in Spanish, in low, sexy Spanish, and then he lies about what he\u2019s said, thinking I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he say?\u201d Jeannie asked her.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll say something like, \u2018I want to hold you and make love to you,\u2019 and pretends he has said he would like to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can have this in your life again? Intimacy of that kind? Are you ready for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very nervous, but I long for it,\u201d she said. \u201cI want him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trust him enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m with him, I feel completely safe. Nurtured. Protected. He doesn\u2019t hurry me\u2014he\u2019s very kind. Very cautious. He\u2019s the only kind of man I could deal with right now, and he knows that.\u201d She shivered and said in a low breath, \u201cBut there\u2019s a fire in him. I can feel it.\u201d She took a deep breath.</p><p>She\u2019d been home from Virgin River for a month and was beginning to think in terms of going back after the holidays. But then Brad came to see her with an agenda that turned her world upside down again. It was afternoon and Brie had been thinking about what to prepare for dinner when she heard her father go to the door. It always gave her a little tremor when the doorbell rang, even in broad daylight, afraid of who it would be standing there, and that Sam would forget to check through the peephole.</p> <p>Sam came into the kitchen and said, somberly, \u201cIt\u2019s Brad.\u201d</p><p>She dried her hands on a dish towel. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll go to my office.\u201d</p><p>When she went into the family room, he was standing there, still wearing his leather jacket, the one she had given him two Christmases ago. His hands were in his pockets, his head down. He was as tall as Jack; as broad shouldered with a wide, hard chest. Looking at his back, she realized it could almost be Jack, and for a split second she wondered if she had married him because he resembled her brother in so many ways. That sandy-brown hair, square jaw, long legs, powerful physique.</p><p>Mike wasn\u2019t anything like the Sheridan men\u2014he was six feet, quite tall to her five foot three, but not towering like her brother and father, like Brad. His shoulders and arms were strong, but he was lean. There was that soft, coal-black hair, high cheekbones, black eyes, tan skin, his teeth so white they were almost startling. His hands were soft and his fingers long and graceful. She hadn\u2019t seen him without a shirt, but she knew his chest and belly were muscled and hard, almost hairless. She found herself imagining that below his waist was more of that black hair, swirling downward. His legs were the strong, sculpted legs of a runner\u2014she remembered the feel of his thighs as she lay across his lap to be kissed.</p><p>She had to shake herself, focus on the moment.</p><p>\u201cBrad, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and turned, smiling when he saw her. He reached for her as an old friend might, his arms open. She allowed these brief hugs, but then extricated herself quickly. \u201cI have to talk to you, Brie. Is this a good time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Here, sit,\u201d she said, indicating the couch. When he had taken a seat, she chose the love seat, not beside him but facing him at an angle.</p><p>\u201cThis is hard,\u201d he said, dropping his chin, looking down. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to do this for months.\u201d He stared at the floor for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Brad?\u201d she asked impatiently.</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cMe and Christine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not together anymore. We split up. A few months ago. Not long after your... The incident.\u201d</p><p>It took her a second to absorb that. Then she gave a short huff of laughter and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you expect me to say. I\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hands, but managed to snag only one. \u201cBrie, I was a fool. I made a terrible mistake. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. I\u2019m a screwup. But I still love you. I never stopped loving you.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hand away, and the look on her face was one of incredulity. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious.\u201d</p><p>He reached again, but she pulled back. \u201cI know\u2014it\u2019s crazy. We split up months ago, but for months before that, we weren\u2019t getting along at all. We tried to keep it together, if for no other reason than we\u2019d put our spouses, our families through so much. Brie, it was never the answer, but I didn\u2019t see it for a while. God, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her face held the shock of what he\u2019d just said\u2014more than he even realized he\u2019d said. Put our spouses through so much...? \u201cShe wasn\u2019t divorced when it started,\u201d Brie said softly. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t, was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answered. \u201cNot really, no. You know they were having trouble anyway. They weren\u2019t going to make it. Glenn didn\u2019t know about us,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much to know. Really, there was all that other stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristine and Glenn split up because of you!\u201d she said. She stood up and backed away from him. \u201cIt was more than a year,\u201d she said. \u201cGod, you took your best friend\u2019s wife! And he doesn\u2019t even know?\u201d She turned sharply, presenting her back.</p><p>He approached her and put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t exactly like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were feelings, maybe. Temptations, I guess. A kiss or two. But I told you the truth about when we got involved. Physically...sexually... I just didn\u2019t go all the way back to the beginning because honest to God, I didn\u2019t know where the beginning was, or where it was going. Jesus, Brie\u2014\u201d</p><p>She turned around and faced him. \u201cYou left me a year ago. You were sleeping with her for a year before that. But you were fooling around with her for even longer, lying to me with every kiss good-night, every touch....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was something physical...I can\u2019t describe it.... It was like I couldn\u2019t stop myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething physical?\u201d She laughed. \u201cOh, God! You were sleeping with both of us! At least she threw Glenn out, but not you! You had two women! Two women who loved you, wanted you!\u201d She laughed at him, a cynical and mean laugh. \u201cYou must have been in heaven! You think that\u2019s something I\u2019m going to get over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s no good explanation. I was an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been paying you alimony. Even while I\u2019ve been unemployed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have it all. It\u2019s not spent.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in disbelief. \u201cI never thought this could get worse.\u201d</p><p>He took another step toward her. \u201cIf you\u2019ll give me a chance, I\u2019d just like a chance to show you that I\u2014 I\u2019m sorry, Brie. Can\u2019t we\u2014? Can\u2019t we try again? See each other? See if we can rekindle some of what we had? I know it\u2019ll take time.... If we can\u2019t, I have no one to blame but myself, but can we just\u2014\u201d</p><p>She gave a huff of laughter. \u201cPoor Brad,\u201d she said. \u201cYou went from two women who couldn\u2019t get enough of you to no one. You\u2019re not getting laid, are you? You\u2019re pathetic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re angry\u2014you should be. I\u2019ll make it up to you somehow. Just give me time, give us time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she yelled at him. \u201cNo!\u201d And then she started to laugh again. \u201cGod, you don\u2019t know how long I waited to hear you say that! Even while I was hating you, I might have taken you back!\u201d She shook her head in disbelief. \u201cJesus! Thank God you didn\u2019t pull this sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, do I want anything to do with a man who can cheat on his wife because there\u2019s some kind of physical thing? Something you can\u2019t even explain? Forgive me, but I thought we had something physical!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did. We will again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No. Go. Get out of here. You left me for my best friend and now you\u2019d like to see if we can rekindle something? Oh, you are such a fool. What did I ever see in you? Why didn\u2019t I know this about you? Go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Brie, there\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take any more,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThey found him.\u201d</p><p>She was stunned for a second. She couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cThey found him\u2014Jerome Powell. He\u2019s in Florida. They have him in custody there. They\u2019re working on the extradition. I think you\u2019ll get a call tomorrow from the D.A. I heard it at work.\u201d</p><p>She took a step toward him. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this first?\u201d she asked in a furious whisper.</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted you to know that I love you. I\u2019d like to be with you through this. With you when they bring him back. I want to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she said in a breath. \u201cYou thought I\u2019d take you back out of fear? Helplessness? You\u2019re an idiot, that\u2019s what you are! A big, stupid, goddamn idiot!\u201d</p><p>He hung his head. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I feel pretty terrible about what happened? Haven\u2019t I been around since it happened? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s killing me? Hell, Brie\u2014that\u2019s probably what broke me and Christine apart.\u201d</p><p>She started to laugh again, but tears smarted in her eyes at the same time. \u201cIt\u2019s all about you, isn\u2019t it, Brad?\u201d There was a sweet voice in her head. There will be no taking, mija. Only giving.</p><p>\u201cI want a chance to try to make it right,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t. No one can make it right, especially you. You made your choice, Brad. You\u2019re stuck with it.\u201d Then she ran out of the room. She went to her bedroom and slammed the door.</p><p>Brad was about to follow her when he came face-to-face with Sam, who blocked the hallway. \u201cI think you\u2019d better go, son,\u201d he said patiently, but firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery ludicrous word. Goodbye, Brad,\u201d he said.</p><p>Brad turned to leave and Sam followed him, locking the front door behind him.</p><p>In her bedroom, Brie was already folding clothes into neat little piles on the bed. She was thinking of Brad\u2019s lame suggestion that he take care of her through this. He didn\u2019t know the meaning of taking care of his woman.</p><p>There was a light tapping at the door. \u201cDad?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Brie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in, Daddy,\u201d she said. When he opened the door, she filled his arms. \u201cOh, Daddy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Brie. We\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, I\u2019m going to Virgin River.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019m going to Mike. I want to be there. I\u2019m going right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to take you?\u201d he asked, smiling down at her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to stay around, but I could take you, so you wouldn\u2019t be alone on the drive.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head, but smiled back. \u201cNo, I\u2019m okay in the car. But if I don\u2019t go right away, I might lose my nerve. Dad, tell me the truth\u2014do you think I\u2019m making a fool of myself? Going to him? Trusting him?\u201d</p><p>Sam looked nonplussed. \u201cMike? Why would I worry about Mike?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cJack has warned me of his fickle, roving ways with women. A player, he says.\u201d</p><p>Sam chuckled. \u201cAh, Jack, who was as pure as the driven snow. Hah. I guess they know each other pretty well, Mike and your brother. Brie,\u201d he said, running his big hand along the hair at her temple, pushing her hair behind her ear, \u201cI could be wrong. I\u2019ve been wrong before, but I can\u2019t think of any reason not to believe Mike, not to trust him.\u201d He smiled into her eyes. \u201cYour brother trusted him for many years\u2014for that he has to be a good man. And obviously he cares about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe makes me feel like a person,\u201d she said softly. \u201cLike a woman. I haven\u2019t felt like a woman since Brad...And then...\u201d She stopped. \u201cI have to go before they bring that monster back here for trial. Before I face him and can\u2019t imagine a loving touch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s what\u2019s waiting for you in Virgin River?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI think so. I hope so. If I\u2019m wrong...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re packing,\u201d Sam said. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel like you could be wrong.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re my baby, and you\u2019re thirty-one,\u201d he said in a whisper. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be alone and afraid. I want you to have love in your life. It\u2019s the natural order of things. And I think Mike gives that to you. You go,\u201d he said, kissing her forehead. \u201cI think you\u2019ve had enough of the tough side of life. Time for a little bit of the tender side.\u201d He pulled her close. \u201cDon\u2019t be gone too long. I\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><p>When Brie pulled into Virgin River, there were still trucks and cars surrounding the bar, though it was nearly the time of night Jack and Preacher would close. She pulled her Jeep right up to the front of the RV, parking beside Mike\u2019s SUV. She could talk to Jack in the morning; she needed Mike\u2019s arms around her. Jack would not misunderstand her presence here, though he might not be happy about her decision. She even left her suitcases in the back of the Jeep when she went to the RV\u2019s door.</p><p>Mike opened the door and saw her standing there, looking up at him. He gasped and jumped out of the RV. \u201cBrie!\u201d he said in a breath, grabbing her up in his arms, lifting her clear of the ground, burying his face in her neck.</p><p>Her whole world tilted and warmth spread through her from deep inside; just feeling his arms around her made so much right. Everything was suddenly as it should be. She held on to him, held him tight, feeling his lips, his breath on her neck. \u201cBrie,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Why didn\u2019t you tell me you were coming?\u201d</p> <p>She looked up into his black eyes. \u201cIt was sudden,\u201d she said. \u201cI came to be with you, if that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>He ran a knuckle down her cheek to her chin, lifting it. \u201cAnything you want is all right. You have only to tell me what it is.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been thinking about this through a five-hour drive, and had planned a hundred ways to approach it delicately. But in the end she said, \u201cI need you to make love to me.\u201d</p><p>Instead of looking shocked or excited by the prospect, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, honey? What happened?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, looking into his eyes with moist ones of her own. \u201cBrad,\u201d she said in a breath. \u201cHe came to ask me for another chance. And in the same conversation, told me they\u2019d found the rapist and would be extraditing him to California for trial.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet a moment, a half smile on his lips. Then he asked, \u201cAnd you think I can make that go away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I knew if I didn\u2019t come here soon...Mike, I\u2019m not whole, you have to know that. It\u2019s been so long, and there\u2019s been so much.... I just learned my husband was with two women for a long, long time before he chose her. And what Powell did to me... I can want you, but truthfully, I\u2019m not sure I can ever feel again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he said. He gently touched his lips to hers. \u201cYou already feel, or you wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>She said, \u201cQuiero que me abraces. Para amarte durante la noche.\u201d I want you to hold me. To love me through the night.</p><p>A slow smile grew on Mike\u2019s face. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any secrets, have I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNada,\u201d she said. Not one.</p><p>Mike laughed softly. \u201cIt serves me right. I didn\u2019t know you spoke Spanish,\u201d he said. \u201cTu debes sentir estas manos amorosas as\u00ed a ti.\u201d You should feel the touch of loving hands.</p><p>\u201cDeja a que sean sus manos.\u201d Let them be your hands.</p><p>\u201cBrie, are you sure you\u2019re ready for this? Are you sure you want it to be me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m only sure I want to try, to feel complete, to feel like a woman again before it\u2019s too late, before that bastard is brought to trial and facing him turns me to stone again. But you? S\u00ed. Te quiero mucho.\u201d Yes. I want you so much.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Jack?\u201d he asked, his hand on the back of her neck under her hair, kneading gently.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t even go into the bar. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have any trouble figuring out why I\u2019m here when he leaves tonight and sees my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to take you to him? Be there when you tell him you\u2019re back?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head again. \u201cI\u2019ll see him tomorrow.\u201d She laughed nervously. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I have to offer. I\u2019m absolutely certain, and still... Maybe you should give me a beer,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTu no necesitas eso. Nada malo te pasara en mis brazos.\u201d You won\u2019t need that. Nothing frightening will ever happen while you\u2019re in my arms. He pulled her to him with the hand at the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m really dead inside?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou know better than that. You\u2019ve never been dead inside, just frightened. You trusted yourself enough to come here. Leave the rest to me.\u201d He touched her lips softly. \u201cYou have to know something while there\u2019s still time for you to change your mind about this. I\u2019m not a Good Samaritan, Brie. Not just a man willing to help a good friend get in touch with her feelings again. I\u2019m in love with you,\u201d he said, hovering over her lips. His breath was hot and sweet on her face, then slowly he descended on her, covering her mouth in a kiss that was powerful and hot, a kiss that seared and demanded. He moved over her parted lips hungrily and she clung to him with a whimper. \u201cI\u2019m so in love with you.\u201d</p><p>When he released her lips, he pulled her up and into the RV and locked the door. She slipped out of her jacket and asked, \u201cWill he come pounding at the door?\u201d</p><p>Mike chuckled low in his throat. \u201cNot a chance. I think even Jack knows when he\u2019d be taking his life in his hands.\u201d With his hands on her face, he pulled her lips onto his, devouring her. He kissed her again. And again. Holding her against him with arms that had ached to hold her like this for too long. He felt her small tongue in his mouth and it made him weak in the knees, it was so delicious, so sweet. All he hoped for was that he could make her comfortable with his touch, soothed enough so that she would welcome more of him. He wanted her to relearn, in his arms, the beauty of what could happen between a man and woman. The joy and ecstasy. After what had been done to her, she should know that in this, the love that he had for her, there would never be fear or pain, but only pleasure. Pleasure so wild and wonderful, it would fill her life for many days and nights to come. These thoughts combined with the sensation of her against him made him erect at once and he sprang to life, folded almost painfully inside his jeans. With a hand on her bottom, he pulled her against him to show her what holding her did to him, and a deep and beautiful moan escaped her.</p><p>\u201cEverything is up to you, Brie,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to change your mind...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered against his lips.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry, baby. Tell me when to slow down, when to stop....\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI trust you. I need you.\u201d</p><p>He drew her through the RV, past the full kitchen and a shower big enough for two into a small bedroom. There were only a couple of feet on each side of the queen-size bed and the walls were lined with closets, drawers and shelves, but it was all beautiful and modern, and plenty big enough.</p><p>His hands went to the bottom of her soft sweater and he drew it slowly over her head, leaving her in only her bra. He was on her mouth again, bruising her lips with the passion of his kiss. He pulled her hands from around his neck and, looking into her eyes, placed her fingers on the buttons of his shirt. She didn\u2019t need to be told\u2014she tugged his shirt out of his pants and worked the buttons quickly, then with her hands against his chest, spread the shirt over his shoulders to bare his chest. She touched the scar on his right shoulder, then caressed his chest with her small soft hands. \u201cI love the way your skin feels,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re so smooth. So silky.\u201d She kissed the hollow place at the base of his neck.</p><p>With one deft movement, the bra disappeared and he pulled her against him, her breasts on his chest. Flesh to flesh. Her arms encircled him and held him close. The feeling of her small hands running up and down his back stirred his blood just as the sensation of her nipples against his chest bored through him with heat. One of his hands found and cupped a full breast, his thumb running over that erect nipple, stimulating it. Then he lowered his lips to gently draw on it, and she moaned softly, sweetly, whispering his name.</p><p>Mike was aching for her. He brought his mouth back to hers, and while kissing her, he backed her slowly and carefully to the bed until the backs of her legs were against it. Then his hands went to the snap of her jeans. \u201cOkay?\u201d he asked against her lips. \u201cDo you need a little more time?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He undid them carefully, slowly. Then, sliding his hands gently along her hips, moved them down. He sat her down on the bed and knelt to take off her shoes, pull off her jeans. When he stood and put his hands on the buckle of his belt, he hesitated, waiting for her to tell him if it was too much, too fast. But she brushed them away and replaced his hands with her own. She undid the buckle, the snap and zipper, and tugged the pants down. Freed, he leaped out at her and her eyes widened briefly. She glanced up at him, then, her eyes closing, she leaned toward him. But he stopped her by putting his hands on her shoulders. \u201cAnother time, mi amor. Tonight is about you.\u201d He gently pushed her back onto the bed while he freed himself from his boots and trousers so he could get in beside her.</p><p>Both of them naked, he took her into his arms. She was so small and compact against him. He closed his eyes and in his mind he could see them against the white sheets, her ivory body against his tan, his dark hand on her hip and her small pale hand on his. He filled his hands with her satiny flesh, covering her body with long, smooth, calming strokes from her shoulders to her knees while he kissed her deeply. He caressed her gently for several minutes, giving her time to get used to the sensation of their naked bodies together, entwined. She slipped a leg over his and her hands on him became bolder as she moved down his back and grabbed his butt, pulling him closer, harder against her. He slipped his hand between their bodies and moved it lower, inching his fingers down over her flat belly and farther, finding, with some surprise, that she parted her legs for him. He found the prominent little knot he was looking for and gave it a little attention, rubbing her gently, bringing a deep, lusty moan from her. Then he moved lower still, gently dipping a finger into her to find she was ready\u2014this was a passionate woman who had been too long without a man to love her. But he wasn\u2019t going to rush her; he was going to bring this to her sweetly, slowly. The last touch she\u2019d felt had been brutal. He would erase that with gentleness and love so that she would never again fear it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He rolled her gently onto her back and rose above her. \u201cLet me look at you, Brie,\u201d he whispered. He ran a slow hand down her body from her neck to her pubis and over, letting his fingers slip into her damp softness for just a second, causing her to writhe against him. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything this beautiful,\u201d he whispered. He put his hands on her hips and gently squeezed. She was soft and lush. He began a line of gentle kisses from her neck to her shoulder, her chest, her breast, her belly. Then he rose to kiss her neck again and with his lips against her ear, he whispered, \u201cTrust yourself, Brie.\u201d Then he resumed his kisses, less gentle as he lowered his mouth until he was at the center of her body. He parted her legs and put his mouth on her, delicately at first, and then with more pressure. She moved her hips against his mouth; he heard her groan and cry out, then felt her hands on his shoulders, gripping him fiercely, and he pulled on her carefully with his lips, massaging with his tongue until he could feel her tremble, open up, clench, vibrate against him. It was glorious, the way she let it go, let him take her to that pinnacle and beyond. This pleased and surprised him; he had prepared himself to have to coax her into pleasure, into orgasm, but she was quick and hot, consuming him, her fingers digging into his shoulders. As she relaxed, he drew away, rising slowly, kissing her belly, her breast, her neck, her mouth. \u201cBrie, you are wonderful. Delicious. You honor me.\u201d</p><p>She had trouble catching a breath. She said, \u201cOh, God. Oh, my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to have trouble feeling....\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she whispered, weak and spent in his arms.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he whispered, gently pecking at her lips.</p><p>\u201cI want more of you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>But he took his time again, allowing her to recover, slowly arousing her with slow hands, sweet lips. There was a fierce ache in him that wanted to dive into her and experience her quickly, bring his own release, but he ignored it. He concentrated on her responses, sure that she was rising to that ultimate pleasure again. And then, because he was honor bound, he whispered against her ear, \u201cBrie...I have a condom.\u201d</p><p>She froze. \u201cNo,\u201d she said emphatically, shaking her head. \u201cPlease, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Brie. We\u2019ll do without....\u201d</p><p>He gave her a little time to forget about that, spreading his kisses over her once more, lingering at her breasts, her neck, her lips. Then finally he rose over her and with a knee placed carefully between her legs, he gently moved them apart again. He looked at her face; her eyes were closed and her head turned away from him. She held her bottom lip between her teeth, tensely. With a hand on her chin, he turned her back to face him and kissed her tenderly, lightly. Then harder, opening her lips with his. Her hands went to his hips, whether to hold him back or draw him in, he wasn\u2019t sure. He lowered himself to her and the moment he touched her where he might enter her, she flinched. Stiffened. \u201cBrie,\u201d he commanded softly. \u201cLook at my face. Look at me, baby. It\u2019s me. Say my name, mi amor.\u201d</p><p>In a breath it came. \u201cMiguel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut your hand on me, Brie. Show me the way. You\u2019re in control.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her small hand around him, and at the merest touch he was ready to lose it. He wasn\u2019t sure he could last long enough to please her again, but he was hell-bent to try. Slowly, cautiously, she led him into her. \u201cMy love,\u201d he said, \u201cfocus on my face, Brie. It\u2019s you and me, and I love you. I\u2019ll never give you anything but love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiguel,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cBrie,\u201d he whispered. He slid into her slowly, filling her, and she tilted her head back, her pelvis up, and with her hands again on his hips, pulled him deeper. Being inside her like that, he thought he might die, it was so good. He pulled up her knees and balanced on them, moving within her, rocking, stroking, making sure to create the friction that he knew from experience worked, while pushing himself deeply inside, which also worked. It was so important that she reclaim the joy of this. It wasn\u2019t just feeling again, but feeling to her very core; feeling that was so shattering, it would leave her consumed. She was straining against him, bucking, losing herself in the moment, reaching for another orgasm, and this time from the feared penetration. This was what he wanted for her, that she could have success now, like this, with a man who wanted only to please her, with a man who adored and respected her and loved her more than life itself. He knew she would have to trust him completely for her release to come.</p><p>When her orgasm came, it closed around him with a powerful grip and he felt her fingernails dig into his butt. He moaned in deep appreciation while he pushed harder against her, deeper into her. She clung to him and cried out. He held her fast, held her close, still, his body her body, as one. \u201cBrie,\u201d he gasped. \u201cDios.\u201d And when he sensed that she was almost complete, the storm nearly past for her, he moved inside her again, deep and strong and quick, and that was all it took to bring her up and over the top once more. She gasped and rose against him, pulsing around him all over again. When it stole her breath away and she was again at the peak, he let himself go. He went off like a rocket inside her. The strength of it overpowered him and caused him to tremble.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d she whispered, astonished by him. By herself. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>He nearly collapsed, but held his weight off her. A fine mist of perspiration covered them. Recovery was a long time in coming for both of them; she lay weak and spent beneath him, her hair scattered across the bed in disarray, her eyes closed, a small smile curving her lips. \u201cBrie,\u201d he finally said in a breath. \u201cYou\u2019re smiling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, not opening her eyes, her lips curving a little more.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI think we have it back, love.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slightly, eyes still closed. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t,\u201d she said, groggy.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head again. \u201cI never had anything like that before....\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her, smoothing the hair back from her brow. \u201cYou\u2019re incredible. Like a shooting star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Her arms lay spread wide, limp, on the bed above her head. \u201cThank you,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He kissed her tenderly, tugging at her lips with his. \u201cFeel better?\u201d He kissed her again, small, delicate kisses. \u201cYou seem pretty relaxed,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cHmm. I never give good sex enough credit,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t slip me a Valium, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Valium, no.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI wanted you to feel good. I didn\u2019t know you were going to give back so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Neither did I.\u201d</p><p>He sucked gently at the lobe of her ear. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it could be like this,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou didn\u2019t turn into stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI was hoping to feel nice.\u201d She opened her eyes, but only a little. \u201cWarm and cuddly. Feminine. I didn\u2019t know you were going to blow my brains out two or three times....\u201d</p><p>He lifted a black brow. \u201cTwo or three?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but that\u2019s okay\u2014I\u2019m fine now. Better than fine. Do you think you can remember how you did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could go write it all down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to feel like a woman again....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby. You did\u2014trust me. Congratulations. They just don\u2019t make any more woman than that. Now I\u2019m doomed,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I can\u2019t live without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d she said with a weak little chuckle. \u201cI\u2019ll hang around awhile.\u201d She ran her hand along his hair at his temple. \u201cThank you. I couldn\u2019t have done that without you.\u201d</p><p>He rolled onto his back. \u201cWell, if you figure out how to do that without me, we\u2019ll get a patent. Retire in the Swiss Alps. Eat caviar for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>She giggled again. \u201cReally, that was so good....\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you fixed everything. It seems to be working fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he answered. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t touch it. There are no words...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you were in love with me,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI am over the moon, I\u2019m so in love with you. But right now, after sex like that, it might sound insincere. Because I\u2019ve never had sex like that in my life.\u201d</p><p>She rolled to her side and propped herself up on an elbow. \u201cReally? You haven\u2019t? How is that possible?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cCan we worry about that tomorrow?\u201d he asked her. \u201cI\u2019d hate to screw this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to try this again before tomorrow. See if we know what we\u2019re doing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist,\u201d she said again, laughing.</p><p>\u201cI want you again,\u201d he said. \u201cAlready. I think you have a magical effect on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She laughed. \u201cPoor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy morning, you might regret this.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cBetcha I don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>And he began with soft kisses on her lips...</p><p>When Jack got home, the baby was asleep and Mel was sitting up, comfortable in one of his shirts, the laptop on her knees in front of her, either researching something on the Internet or writing e-mails. It always made him smile to see her like that. She said she liked to wear his shirts right after her shower, smelling his musk on them. He liked to wear those same shirts the next day, a reminder of her body inside, the faint memory of her fresh scent apparent. \u201cI have a surprise for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie is back in town. She\u2019s with Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Mel said, suddenly giving him her attention. She closed the laptop and put it aside.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her. When I was leaving the bar, her Jeep was parked next to Mike\u2019s car. She came to Mike. Not to us\u2014to Mike.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWell, that makes sense. He loves her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cHow could you not?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Jack sat back on the couch. \u201cI thought he was just trying to get laid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty irrelevant,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re all trying to get laid. Some of you actually love the women you\u2019re trying to get close to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act like we\u2019re all just a bunch of bulls being led around by our dicks.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him, gleefully for a woman who was annoyed to be pregnant, and moody to boot. \u201cDo I? I wonder why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think this makes sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtraordinary sense. It even makes me nostalgic.\u201d</p><p>That caused him to smile devilishly. \u201cNostalgic enough to take me to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me something\u2014are you letting go of this weird control thing you have over Brie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, almost tiredly. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t wanted her to have a full life. I thought she was going to have that with Brad, the shit. It was Mike who worried me\u2014he\u2019s been such a frickin\u2019 tomcat.\u201d He glanced at his wife\u2019s disapproving expression. \u201cYeah, yeah, let\u2019s not go over that again. We all made our rounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt he made any more rounds than you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt was just the marriages that got under my skin,\u201d he said. \u201cSo help me God, if he marries her and walks away from her, I am going to kill him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLooks to me like he\u2019s totally sunk,\u201d she said. \u201cA complete goner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jack said shortly. \u201cI\u2019m out of it now\u2014she\u2019s staked her claim.\u201d Then he reached out a hand, threaded it under her hair and around the back of her neck, pulling her toward him. He kissed her deeply. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPursued. How are you feeling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLucky.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>In the cool light of morning Mike rose on an elbow to look down at the beautiful pale body of his love. Brie slept on her stomach, and the curve of her back and small, round bottom was exquisite. Irresistible. He hated to disturb her, her rest was so peaceful, but he couldn\u2019t help himself\u2014he touched her. He ran his hand tenderly from her neck, down her spine, over her bottom. She hummed in half sleep and he pressed a gentle kiss into the small of her back.</p><p>There was a soft knock at the door. She lifted her head; her hair cascaded over her face. \u201cShhh,\u201d he told her. \u201cDon\u2019t move. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>While he sat on the edge of the bed to retrieve his jeans from the floor, she saw the tattoo on his back for the first time\u2014a large sunburst right between his shoulder blades. Very sexy on that broad, brown back. She\u2019d seen the other one earlier, an armband in the shape of a chain. He shrugged into his pants, pulling them up over his hard, compact butt.</p> <p>When Mike opened the door he saw that someone, Jack or Preacher, had left a breakfast tray on the ground just outside the door. He looked around; there was no one there. Mike brought the tray inside. There were two covered dishes and a thermal pitcher of coffee. He put it on the table. His kitchen was fully equipped with dishes, utensils, pots and pans\u2014but he hardly ever used it. He took all his meals at the bar.</p><p>Then he realized something else was missing\u2014there was no log splitting this morning despite the fact that the weather was perfect. Jack was giving them more than just privacy\u2014he wasn\u2019t even making his presence felt on the property.</p><p>Mike took off his jeans again, letting them drop. He got back into his bed and continued the pleasurable study of Brie\u2019s smooth, silky back. He scrunched up her tangled hair and pulled it to his lips. She hummed contentedly.</p><p>\u201cWho was at the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoom service,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cBreakfast has been delivered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot for food,\u201d he said. He stretched out over her back, careful not to put all his weight on her. He moved her hair away from her neck, kissing her there, and began to grow firm against her soft bottom.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast can wait,\u201d she said, breathless, tilting her hips upward, wriggling softly against him.</p><p>It occurred to Mike that he\u2019d had a lot of sex in his life, but it had never been like this. There was an intimacy he shared with Brie that went beyond the coupling; they\u2019d been through so much together, emotionally, before the loving. He felt as though there had never been a woman before her; no one had ever taken him into her body in the free, wild, trusting way she did. After that first tentative and hesitant touch, she\u2019d held nothing back from him. She gave her body completely, insatiably. She welcomed his hands, his lips, every bit of him, relying on him to do right by her, showering him with her pleasure over and over.</p><p>He had nearly forgotten that for the better part of a year he hadn\u2019t thought he would enjoy this aspect of life again. Pleasing her, re-creating the joy and safety of sex for her again had put his own burdens so far from his mind that he was completely removed from worry as to whether he could perform. It not only worked well, it worked again and again and again. She created a fire in him that he couldn\u2019t put out. And from her reaction, her response, she had fire of her own. For him. She wasn\u2019t the only one who needed blissful release from a troubled past; Mike needed to be brought back to life, as well. Until that moment he had been focused only on helping her heal, not realizing that she had done the same for him.</p><p>He slipped a hand beneath her, creeping down over her belly, lifting her pelvis slightly. He gently parted her legs with his knee. \u201cIs this okay? Like this?\u201d he whispered, pressing toward her again.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>He slipped in, moving inside her yet again, rocking her, pushing smoothly against a deep, erotic place inside. A slow, even pumping of his hips brought deep sighs from her; she moved against him, meeting him with each stroke. There was a special place inside a woman that was secret, sensitive, and he\u2019d made a study of her body and knew exactly where to go. He thrust against that secret spot, rhythmically, gently but firmly, relentlessly. Finally she pushed back against him, eager for the pressure he applied, craving it with sighs and whimpers, and after a while a startled gasp escaped her and she lunged into him, hard. He held her against him as she was sent soaring into a pleasure so hot and bold it seemed she couldn\u2019t breathe for a long moment. He enjoyed success; he felt the hot spasms surround him, a flood of liquid heat that poured from her and drenched him, and then he joined her in moment of fulfillment that left them both weak, content.</p><p>When she began to recover, he slipped out of her and gently rolled her over onto her back.</p> <p>\u201cDear heaven,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt anything like that in my life....\u201d</p><p>He rose on an elbow to look down at her beautiful face, her lips crimson from love, her cheeks in high color. \u201cYou like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood lord!\u201d she said, her voice still quivering. \u201cWhat in the world did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic,\u201d he said. \u201cA treat. For both of us. The G-spot.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in stunned wonder for a moment, then surprised him with a laugh. \u201cI thought that was a myth! A legend!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely real,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you know more about my body after one night than I\u2019ve known in my life?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d he said, running a hand over her shoulder and down her arm, entwining his fingers in hers. \u201cIt\u2019s the way you trust me. Let me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you do that again?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cNot for a while, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou amaze me.\u201d She ran a hand over his chest. \u201cThe things you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been with too many women, Brie. I apologize. I can\u2019t undo that. But I have never felt as much a part of a woman as I do with you. It\u2019s like I was never really intimate before now. I can\u2019t explain it any better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, letting her eyes drift closed.</p><p>\u201cIt blows my mind. Do you feel it?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI feel it, Miguel. What are we going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it would be frowned on if we just stayed here, naked, and had a couple of meals a day delivered, for maybe a month or two?\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cHow long do you really think Jack will stay out of our business?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and smiled. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to get dressed eventually....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when I came here after Davie was born? I would listen to you practice your guitar in the early mornings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to pretend you were playing for me. I was so moved by the music, I imagined you playing for me late into the night. You tempted me even then.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI never knew. At that time, you wouldn\u2019t give an inch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was pretty sure all men were dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are. We deserve nothing. But we beg just the same.\u201d He touched her face. \u201cI\u2019m not the same man since you came into my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever be able to make love again,\u201d she said softly. Then, smiling, she said, \u201cNow I\u2019m not sure I can stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLast night, the first time\u2014you froze up, you tensed. You didn\u2019t want the condom.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and shook her head. Then she opened her eyes, met his and said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t feel that latex inside me because he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, my love,\u201d Mike said sweetly. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. A little flashback?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a second, but you brought me into the present and it was all right then.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWay more than all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you should keep in mind,\u201d he said softly, stroking her hair. \u201cNo matter how perfect things seem, you could find yourself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Back there, in that terrifying moment,\u201d she finished for him. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of counseling. They try to prepare you for that. It happened to me once before, that first night at the cabin. It snuck right up on me.\u201d She ran a finger along his ear, down his neck. \u201cTalk about baggage...\u201d</p><p>He smiled into her eyes. \u201cEveryone has something, Brie. Everyone has a haunt, a relentless ghost. The best way to scare it off is to look it square in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so good,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no danger of disease,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been with a woman since before the shooting, and in the hospital every cell in my body was screened. But there is another matter.... Are you taking pills?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, but her eyes were clear.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cMel can help with that. There\u2019s something she can give you to prevent a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I didn\u2019t do that?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat if I didn\u2019t go to Mel?\u201d</p><p>That caused him to straighten a bit. \u201cI assume you passed biology 101,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no telling what would happen.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cProbably nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the amount of pleasure we have correlates to conception, there will be a hundred babies by the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d like me to see Mel, I will. This is probably just crazy. I wouldn\u2019t push you, rush you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie, you can\u2019t rush me. I want to give you everything. If you wanted me to give you a baby, I would die trying, but only if it was our baby. Together. Maybe you should think about it a little longer, until you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cAh. I knew I forgot something. It\u2019s the reason I came here, to you\u2014it wasn\u2019t just because I needed your touch to help make me stronger. It was so much more than that. I couldn\u2019t be away from you a second longer. I think you\u2019re the best friend I\u2019ve ever had. In fact, we became so close in the last six months, I didn\u2019t think we could get any closer.\u201d She put her fingers on his lips. \u201cThe joke\u2019s on me\u2014this goes beyond my wildest expectations. If you\u2019re only pretending, you\u2019re a gifted actor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo acting, Brie. I love you. Endlessly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you.\u201d</p><p>Her admission fulfilled his deepest desires. \u201cYou mean this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, Miguel. I can\u2019t imagine being without you. Not now. You\u2019ve been everything to me for months. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNunca so\u00f1e que yo pudiera tener esto en mi vida.\u201d I never dreamed I could have this in my life.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know it existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is what you want? To let nature take its course?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetting on nature probably isn\u2019t very risky. Before I knew...\u201d She took a breath. \u201cI stopped taking my pills while I was married to Brad. We\u2019d been talking about a baby and I thought I\u2019d surprise him. I didn\u2019t know he was brewing a romance with my best friend.... A long time before... Well,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a year before he left me. It was longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what he told you yesterday?\u201d Mike asked. \u201cAt the same time he was explaining Powell had been found?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think he let it slip,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess she booted her husband on the excuse of their many little fights, but it was really because she was in love with Brad. And he knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man...\u201d Mike said in a breath.</p><p>\u201cBut he never stopped sleeping with me. I was clueless, trying to surprise him with a baby. Nothing happened, though. I didn\u2019t get pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, honey,\u201d he said, stroking her arm. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s best that didn\u2019t work for you, under the circumstances. But this could be different. Your eyes should be wide open. I\u2019m told you shouldn\u2019t trust the water around here. It might be wise to do some planning, for your sake. I live in a trailer in Virgin River.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetails.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt more at home.\u201d She touched his handsome face. \u201cIf last night made a baby, it will be a beautiful baby. I don\u2019t want Mel\u2019s help to make sure it doesn\u2019t stick. If it\u2019s there, it\u2019s yours\u2014and I want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s how it will be,\u201d he said. He kissed her deeply, passionately. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want this to end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no end in sight, mi amor. Trust me.\u201d</p> <p>Jack hadn\u2019t been watching the RV during the morning, even though it had been on his mind. It was a pure accident that he happened to see the door open and Brie step out. He glanced at his watch\u2014eleven. Almost lunch. Right behind her was Mike. Probably he should have turned away, but he didn\u2019t. His sister looked so small and girlish in her jeans, moccasins, suede jacket with fringe and all that light brown hair cascading down her back almost to her waist.</p><p>She stood in front of Mike and he lifted her chin, pressing an intimate kiss to her lips. Even from this distance it was easy to see they were not anxious to be parted. But in a moment Mike pulled himself away and went to his SUV to leave while Brie walked toward the back door of the bar.</p><p>Jack went behind the bar quickly so as not to get caught watching. He picked up a perfectly clean glass and began to wipe it with a towel. The door opened and Brie walked in, and he almost took a step back. He had never seen her look this way. She was radiant. There was an expression on her face, a glow in her eyes, a secret smile on her lips that said volumes. She didn\u2019t hesitate\u2014she walked behind the bar, right up to him, and put her arms around his waist. He got rid of that glass and towel and wrapped his arms around her, hugging her close.</p><p>All Jack had wanted since June was to have his sister back, well and whole, restored. Happy and alive, without that fuzzy blotch of fear and uncertainty around the edges of her aura like a smudge. He wanted his Brie back, renewed and a force in the world once again. Jack hadn\u2019t been able to give that to her\u2014none of the family had been able to do it. And yet the young woman in his embrace nearly vibrated with joy. It wasn\u2019t as though the old Brie was merely back, but this was a new Brie\u2014a woman reborn. A woman experiencing love and life as if for the first time.</p><p>Sometimes it took him such a long time to accept the very things that he knew intimately for himself. The very things he had discovered in his wife\u2019s arms. What Brie needed in her life, what everyone needed, was perfect love. He\u2019d found that with Mel, Preacher had found it with Paige and now... He kissed the top of her head.</p><p>She lifted her head to look up at him. In a voice soft and sincere, she said, \u201cYou are never to doubt him again. Never.\u201d</p> <p>He put his hand along the hair at her temple and smiled tenderly into her eyes. He gave his head a very slight shake\u2014never again, he was saying to her. Brie had chosen her mate. And for all Jack\u2019s previous doubts, it appeared she had chosen well.</p><p>Jack had resisted when he should have trusted his sister to know what she needed in her life, and he should have trusted Mike, as much a best friend as Preacher, to treat her like the precious jewel she was. Whatever had happened between them had clearly surpassed a physical fulfillment.</p><p>My wife, Jack thought, is always right about everything.</p><p>For Mel, a nightmare had come to roost in the form of sixteen-year-old Sophie Landau. She thought something might have \u201chappened to her.\u201d Mel had a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach even before more of the story came out. \u201cMe and my girlfriend Becky went to a party that we weren\u2019t supposed to\u2014I said I was staying over at Becky\u2019s and she said she was staying over at my house. Brendan Lancaster invited us. Brendan\u2019s older\u2014he graduated a couple of years ago,\u201d she said with red lips that looked as if she\u2019d been chewing on them.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mel said, encouraging her.</p><p>Sophie sat on the exam table, still dressed, while Mel leaned against the cabinet, listening, dreading. Sophie was on the chubby side with straight brown hair that fell limply onto her shoulders. She had a little problem with acne, her teeth were crooked and she was clearly nervous in a general way\u2014nails bitten down, a hair-twisting habit, an occasional twitch of her cheek.</p><p>\u201cSo you went to a party. Big party?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cSmall. Six or seven kids.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrendan lives alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he lives with his mom, but she\u2019s gone a lot. She was gone over the weekend. And he\u2019s out of school now\u2014you know\u2014working over in Garberville, pouring concrete with his uncle. So there wasn\u2019t anyone there but kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there were a few kids and we drank beer, smoked a couple of joints. And got drunk and a little high. I passed out. Becky thinks she did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky thinks she did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know, because she got wasted and went to Brendan\u2019s mother\u2019s bedroom and lay down and woke up at about three in the morning. Me\u2014I think I must have passed out, because I was just waking up in the morning, in Brendan\u2019s room. There were only a couple of kids still there\u2014Becky, Brendan, a couple others sleeping in the living room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I felt really awful. Like I\u2019d been hit in the head with a brick and my stomach was all upset. I couldn\u2019t wait to get home and sleep it off. When I got home I told my mother I thought I\u2019d got the flu while I was at Becky\u2019s, and I went to get into bed, and undressed, you know? My underpants were inside out and backward.\u201d</p><p>Ew, Mel thought. I have another one.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014I didn\u2019t think anything about it\u2014figured I did that to myself drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig drinker, are you?\u201d</p><p>She hung her head. \u201cNot really,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to a few parties with these guys. Maybe three. I never got so trashed before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver pass out and put on your undies inside out and backward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Nothing like that. But I realize I was pretty drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t think anything about it? Let me ask you something\u2014did you have any soreness anywhere? Bruises or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a little sore, down there,\u201d she said, glancing into her lap. \u201cI just thought it was impossible. You know? Because I thought if anything had happened, I would\u2019ve woken up. But then later when I heard this girl in the locker room at gym class telling one of her girlfriends to never go to one of those parties\u2014those beer parties. And she said something like, \u2018I\u2019m not even going to tell you what happened to me! You just wouldn\u2019t believe it!\u2019 And right away I knew. Don\u2019t ask me how I knew\u2014I just knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you might have been raped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might\u2019ve been, yeah. I don\u2019t know. It just doesn\u2019t seem like those guys... They\u2019re just friends. They don\u2019t seem like the kind of guys who...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you missed periods or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the pill. I\u2019m on it for my periods, you know? Because they\u2019re awful. I got my period on time about a week later, but now I\u2019m starting to worry about other stuff. Like what if something happened to me and I got something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStraight thinking, kiddo. We can check for everything and put your mind at ease. But, Sophie\u2014I\u2019ve heard something similar to this before and I\u2019m concerned. I have no idea if anything happened to you besides a little too much beer, but I seriously need you to talk to a friend of mine, a police officer, who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a sec,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie, you\u2019re not in trouble. My advice is to stop going to unchaperoned parties where alcohol is served and joints are available, but that\u2019s just advice. My friend might want to ask you who was there, just to see if there are any similarities between your experience and... And other things I\u2019ve picked up just talking with people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if there are? Will the people who were there get in trouble? Because I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie, I can assure you no one\u2019s going to get into trouble for drinking beer. I\u2019m not even interested in the pot. Everything you say will be kept in confidence. But seriously\u2014we need to know what\u2019s going on, if something like assault is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if nothing\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen nothing more will come of it,\u201d Mel said. But in her gut, she knew. \u201cMy friend, he has a lot of detective experience, he\u2019s worked with a lot of kids\u2014and he\u2019s been looking into this stuff already. He\u2019d be very interested in talking to you. And he will never divulge where he got his information without your complete permission. Will you, Sophie? If it could help keep this from happening to anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might,\u201d she said, ducking her head shyly. \u201cLet me think about it.\u201d</p><p>Mel did the requisite pelvic exam, tested for STDs and convinced Sophie to talk to Mike. Mel asked Sophie to wait at the clinic for a little while, just long enough to see if she could find Mike. They could have their conversation in private at the clinic\u2014the safest place she could think of, away from Sophie\u2019s friends and parents. If Mike wasn\u2019t around, she would have to ask Sophie to come back the next day, and cross her fingers that the girl would.</p><p>Mel felt terrible all over. She hated hearing Sophie\u2019s story, because she was convinced there was a date raper in town, maybe even a group of boys, young men, possibly using drugs on unsuspecting girls.</p><p>It was early afternoon when she left Sophie in the clinic and went to the bar. It was quiet, as was usual for the mid-afternoon. Jack\u2019s truck was gone\u2014she assumed he was out at the house, getting in everyone\u2019s business. In the kitchen she found Paige and Preacher getting things started for the evening meal. \u201cHi, guys. Anyone seen Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis car\u2019s out back, but I think he\u2019s locked in with his...You know Brie\u2019s in town, right?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, picking up the phone in the kitchen. She punched in Mike\u2019s land line. \u201cHi, Mike. I hate to do this to you. I need you. It\u2019s about a situation we discussed a while ago\u2014it\u2019s business.\u201d Then she said, \u201cThanks. I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>She went behind the bar and fixed herself a sparkling water, waiting for Mike. The speed with which he appeared gave her a little peace of mind. She hadn\u2019t interrupted anything too complicated or private, and for that she was grateful.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s step out on the porch,\u201d she said.</p><p>Once outside, she explained in hushed tones what she\u2019d just heard, and the girl\u2019s willingness to talk to him. Then she took him across the street and introduced him to Sophie. She should have expected Mike to be a pro, yet she was pleasantly surprised by the tenderness and finesse with which he handled Sophie, putting her at ease at once, gaining her confidence and trust. He took her into Doc\u2019s kitchen, since there were no patients in the clinic. A few moments later he came out, asking for a tablet and pen, then went back behind closed doors. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mel really wanted to go see Brie, but she felt she had to stay at the clinic while Mike interviewed her patient. David had been napping in the reception area in his playpen and she heard him start to rouse. Before long he sent up an alarm and she had to go pick him up, change him, cuddle him quiet. Over an hour passed before Mike walked Sophie out of the kitchen. He had a hand on her back, solicitously escorting her, thanking her in soft tones for helping him so much.</p><p>By the moony eyes Sophie turned up to Mike\u2019s face, not only had he won her over, she adored him. Trusted him completely.</p><p>When Sophie had gone, Mike looked at Mel and gave her a somber nod.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a bad one on the loose, don\u2019t we?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOr ones. Now I have names. Now I can talk to some other youngsters, one of whom I suspect is one of your other girls\u2014because the name didn\u2019t come from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterview. Right away. And I\u2019m going to have to round up some support for Sophie\u2014she\u2019s going to need to talk to a professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily Planning might help with that. And the county has a sexual assault response team.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head almost sadly. \u201cWhen I took this job, this is the last thing I expected to be up against.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie is barely here,\u201d Mel said sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll understand, Mel. In fact, I\u2019m going to have to talk to her about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never tell Jack....\u201d</p><p>He gave a nod. \u201cI\u2019ll ask her to be sensitive to that, but after what Brie\u2019s been through, I have to be up front about this. She\u2019s been lied to\u2014things have been withheld from her. I can\u2019t keep something like this back from her. It\u2019s real important. We\u2019ve barely begun....\u201d</p><p>Mel held up a hand. \u201cYou know what you can and can\u2019t do\u2014and you know we can\u2019t have these teenagers exposed.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI want to see her. Brie. When can I see her?\u201d she asked, jostling David.</p> <p>\u201cI think as soon as ten minutes. Give me a head start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. At least.\u201d</p><p>Something wonderful happened to Mike\u2019s heart when his hand touched the door to his RV, just knowing she was there. Everything about that felt right. When he stepped inside, there she was, waiting. Brie had tidied up the place, put away their clothes and made up the bed. She was sitting at the small table with a tablet in front of her, writing, and looked up at him with those soft, glowing eyes.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help himself\u2014the first thing he did was go to her, lean down and kiss her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked, sitting opposite her.</p><p>\u201cWriting my resignation to the prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd making a list. I\u2019m going to start looking for an office. If I\u2019m going to stay here, I\u2019m going to work. And I\u2019m going to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do, but I\u2019m a lawyer. I can\u2019t work out of this space because I\u2019ll need my things. My computer, books, et cetera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love hearing this. Are we sure we want to make Virgin River home?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can do it, although I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to find an office in this little town. In fact, who knows where I\u2019ll find work? I might have to commute to one of the larger towns, or maybe I\u2019ll be taking whatever work there is in some of these small towns. But, Mike\u2014do you want to leave Virgin River? Because I think you know\u2014I\u2019ll go anywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hands and held them. \u201cI love it here. The best part of my life has come to me here. I have a suggestion. Instead of looking for an office, think about looking for a house. One large enough for an office at home, or one with the space to build on. You could work out of our home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to go with nature, something tells me the need for more space will present itself before long. How do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cLike going forward with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I getting ahead of you?\u201d he asked her. \u201cThis is quick. Your brother, your father, your sisters\u2014they\u2019re going to point out how fast we\u2019re moving. People are going to say we\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI haven\u2019t felt this good in well over a year. I\u2019m due a little crazy happiness. When do you think we\u2019ll come down to earth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSooner than you think. I have some work I have to do. Police work. It\u2019s going to tie me up a little bit, but it\u2019s very important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you about it, but it\u2019s very sensitive. It could be upsetting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m good with sensitive. And I\u2019ll try to look upsetting in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel doesn\u2019t share things like this with anyone, even Jack. She hopes I might help investigate. I told her I was going to talk to you for a lot of reasons, but you\u2019ll have to be discreet with your brother. No question\u2014he can be completely trusted, but this is an arrangement they have and I don\u2019t want to get in the way of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMel has had some young patients she suspects have encountered a date raper. From what she describes, I believe she\u2019s right. I finally have some names\u2014I\u2019m going to do some interviews. See if I can get a fix on what\u2019s happened and who this could be. Then I\u2019m going to get him. Or them.\u201d</p><p>Brie couldn\u2019t help it\u2014a shudder of revulsion passed through her. God, she hated to think of anyone going through what she had. Mike gave her a moment to gather herself and finally she just shook her head, saddened to hear it. \u201cHow awful. Have you ever worked sexual assault? Are you up to speed on this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t worked a sexual assault unit, but I\u2019ve worked with some of those detectives on cases that cross over, and have a little experience from that. And I\u2019ve worked with a lot of kids, which gives me an advantage in this situation. I can get started without your help, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be asking for your advice. Can you deal with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can try. I happen to know a lot about this\u2014and not just from personal experience. I\u2019ve prepped a lot of rape victims for trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d be willing to help. I\u2019m going to go talk to some people,\u201d Mike said. \u201cMel is dying to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at Doc\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy now she might be right outside.\u201d He opened the door and saw her standing near the back door of the bar, bouncing David in her arms to keep him happy, giving them whatever time and space they needed. He gestured for her to come ahead. But Brie got up from the table and went to greet her. She opened her arms to Mel and the baby and they embraced as sisters would.</p><p>Mel slipped David onto the seat beside her at the small kitchen table while Brie got them each a soda. \u201cHow does it feel to be in my kitchen?\u201d Brie asked Mel.</p><p>Mel smiled. \u201cTook you long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to think it through....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThere is no doubt in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think they talk? The men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the way we do. Mike won\u2019t talk to Jack about you, I\u2019m sure of that. Jack has been a real idiot about you and Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s over that now,\u201d Brie said. \u201cSomeone brought us breakfast and left it outside, and I suspect it was Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good. It\u2019s time he came around. I\u2019d apologize for your brother\u2019s stubbornness, but you\u2019ve known him longer than I have.\u201d She laughed. \u201cSomeone should have warned me he can be such an interfering pest. And bossy? Lord.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cOne look at you makes it clear this is the right thing for you. For both of you. Mike is wearing some kind of halo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should. He\u2019s an angel. I\u2019ve never been treated with such kindness and tenderness. Never. He spent months talking me through the dark days without a hint that he expected more from me. How many men do you know who are willing to invest themselves like that, when there might not be anything in it for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike\u2019s a good man,\u201d Mel said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t put a woman he cared about in a difficult position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d even be able to respond to a man again, Mel. You can\u2019t imagine how nervous I was.\u201d</p><p>Mel simply waited quietly; if Brie wanted to be more specific she could. When a moment passed and Brie hadn\u2019t said any more, Mel said, \u201cI\u2019m just so grateful you finally worked it out, and that it brought you back to us.\u201d</p><p>Brie looked upward for a second, shaking her head, still in wonder. It was at times like this that she would miss her sisters most, but with Mel here she had the female connection she needed. That secret talk that women shared. \u201cI had a lot to think about, to consider, but in the end, I\u2019m here because of something that came up in Sacramento.\u201d</p><p>Mel lifted her brows. \u201cAnything you can talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to tell Jack yet\u2014but Mike knows everything. The reason I came suddenly and without calling ahead is because Brad came to see me. Jerome Powell was found in Florida and the ADA is working on extradition to bring him back for trial.\u201d</p><p>Mel reached out and covered her hand. \u201cGod, Brie,\u201d she said in a breath. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to testify against him. Of course. But I\u2019m staying right here until that happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby. You know we\u2019ll all be there for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was bizarre\u2014that I should get this news from Brad. He came to the house to tell me. But before he told me about Powell, he asked for another chance, to see if we could rekindle some of what we had. He\u2019s no longer with Christine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d Mel said, sitting back in shock. \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>A slow smile spread on Brie\u2019s lips. \u201cI showed him the door and then packed immediately. I\u2019m done with that part of my life.\u201d Then the smile vanished as she said, \u201cThe other part, the trial, that\u2019s going to take a little longer. Be a little harder. Who am I kidding? A lot harder.\u201d</p><p>The very first occasion Mike had to present his business card officially came at Valley High School in the guidance counselor\u2019s office. Mrs. Bradford was a cautious and serious woman and, while cordial, she wasn\u2019t about to turn any of her students over to this man without being sure. He invited her to have him checked out with the sheriff\u2019s office if she questioned his authenticity. And he told her a little bit about how he came to be the new town constable, showing her the badge Hope had given him. He\u2019d been to the high school before, talking to the principal and some of the teachers, but just on a get-to-know-you basis, never as part of an investigation. He explained that, in his capacity, he wouldn\u2019t be making arrests of any kind, but that his interviews might help solve a problem.</p><p>He assured Mrs. Bradford that the students he wanted to speak with were in absolutely no trouble, but without even realizing it, might have information that could help him. \u201cThink of it as something like a witness to an accident\u2014someone might have information that can help resolve an issue, without even being aware of it.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bradford disappeared for about twenty minutes, and when she came back she was ready to have a few students called to her office to speak with Mike. He assumed she had called the sheriff.</p><p>Mike talked to a couple of girls who provided him with the names of teens they had seen at parties. Within an hour, Brenda Carpenter was delivered to the counselor\u2019s office and they were left alone together. He knew Brenda\u2019s parents, but in the months he\u2019d been in Virgin River, he hadn\u2019t met her. He showed his badge again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in any trouble,\u201d he assured her. \u201cYou\u2019re under no obligation to talk to me, but I hope you will. I want to ask you about a gathering of kids, a party you might have attended. Maybe recently, maybe quite a while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t go to parties,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cYour name appeared on a list I have of kids who attended one or more parties I\u2019m checking out. It could have been as long ago as last year. What I\u2019m trying to learn about is a party in which there could have been drugs present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about pot. You might not have known if there were drugs present. Being used.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how could I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is worth checking. And what you have to say, if anything, goes no further. I know your parents through Jack and, I promise you\u2014I won\u2019t be discussing this with them or anyone else. I\u2019m looking for information about a party at which people passed out or lost consciousness.\u201d</p> <p>Her pupils shrank at once and her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever found yourself at a party where that happened? Where people\u2014maybe they were drinking\u2014passed out or lost consciousness? Because that information could help me.\u201d</p><p>Brenda just about leaped out of her chair. \u201cWho told you about that? No one was ever supposed to tell about that.\u201d</p><p>He made sure his arms were open, that he appeared accessible to her, even if it was only on a subconscious level. \u201cA student I interviewed claimed to have been at a party where this happened to her. I can\u2019t tell you who\u2014it\u2019s confidential. I don\u2019t know whether you were present or not, which is why I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure? It wasn\u2019t an adult who told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cIt was definitely not an adult. Have anything for me, Brenda? It\u2019s very important.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Why is it so important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that sort of thing has happened, and I really have to make it stop before somebody gets... Well,\u201d he said, shaking his head solemnly. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest for a second\u2014the situation could be deadly. If I knew something, I wouldn\u2019t want that on my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeadly? How? From getting drunk and passing out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf some kind of drug was used to cause a person to lose consciousness, yes.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s back up. Have you ever been to a party where that\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to a party, once, a long time ago, where people drank too much. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat could be all it looked like, if something was slipped in a beer.\u201d</p> <p>She took a breath. \u201cLike I said, a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember who was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your name came up once, although there were several parties where that happened,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m just a simple guy, but I have an idea that maybe you went once and decided you don\u2019t like those parties too much. I\u2019m not guessing why,\u201d he said, holding up his hands. \u201cAll I want to do is get some names from you\u2014confidential\u2014just so I can see if any of the same names turn up at these parties. Regularly.\u201d</p><p>A startled look came over her face, then there was a slow transformation\u2014to anger. She was catching on. She knew now. She wasn\u2019t the only one. A guy or guys were going after the girls.</p><p>Mike turned a tablet with a pen on top toward her. \u201cAnd anything specific would help, like whether a certain person was just there for a little while, a long while, was the host of the party, brought the beer, that sort of thing. That would be important. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>When Mike sat in his car forty minutes later looking through these lists, he knew Brenda was probably the patient who had become pregnant at a party with no idea how. Then something jumped out at him that spelled opportunity and relief at once. There was one name he recognized. It appeared on Sophie\u2019s list\u2014that party had taken place about a month ago. A young man she remembered being there for a short time. The name popped up once more\u2014at a kegger at the rest stop, again for a short time. But the name did not appear on Brenda\u2019s list, the party she had attended last spring, or on any others. Tom Booth. Tom would know the boys present at the party where Sophie passed out.</p><p>Mike could have gone back into the school and asked Mrs. Bradford to call Tom Booth to her office for an interview, but before he had much time to consider that the last bell rang, and he watched students pour out of the building and migrate to cars and buses in the parking lot. Paul had mentioned Tom was helping out at Jack\u2019s homesite after school, and he wondered if he might run into him there.</p><p>And he\u2019d also run into Jack out at the job site. In thinking about it, he might be able to take care of two delicate situations at the same time. Brie had spent the night in his bed, in his arms\u2014it had been a lot more intimate than a trip to the coast, or a dance at a festival. If Jack was going to have an issue with that, he\u2019d rather they get beyond it without Brie being present. He was aware that she\u2019d seen her brother that morning and had said the reunion was uneventful; Jack hadn\u2019t seemed to have had any bone to pick. However, that didn\u2019t cover the territory between two men who loved Brie\u2014a protective brother and a lover.</p><p>Tom\u2019s little red truck wasn\u2019t there when Mike arrived at the building site, but the place was alive with activity, a lot of noise coming from inside the structure. Jack\u2019s truck was parked near the house.</p><p>Inside, Mike found a lot of men at work and Jack in the kitchen on his knees, working baseboards into place around newly installed cabinets. He watched him work for a moment and then said, \u201cLooking real good out here, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned back, sitting on his heels, and looked up at Mike. He pulled a rag out of his back pocket and mopped the sweat and sawdust off his face. Then he stood. Jack had a lot of expressions\u2014there was the good buddy, the comrade, the steely-eyed killer, and there was one that he seemed to reserve for his role as commander and leader. It was not unlike the expression a father would bestow on the beau of a daughter\u2014not quite deadly, not quite docile, but something in between. Purposely unreadable, giving away no emotion. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said simply, responding to the compliment.</p><p>\u201cI thought if you had anything you wanted to say to me, I\u2019d give you a chance to do that while Brie\u2019s occupied with other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYeah, I have something to say. We\u2019ve been over this, but just let me say this once more, so you know where I\u2019m coming from. She\u2019s real special to me and I\u2019ve seen her hurt. Jesus, worse than hurt. You know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>Mike gave a nod. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis thing that\u2019s going on with you and my sister, I fought it. It really scared me, got under my skin....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Mike said again. \u201cI under\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a fool,\u201d Jack said, cutting him off. He shook his head in frustration. \u201cChrist almighty, Valenzuela\u2014you\u2019ve had my back how many times? You\u2019d fight beside me in a heartbeat, put yourself in harm\u2019s way to protect me or any member of our squad. I don\u2019t know why I got my back up like I did. When a woman in your family gets hurt like that\u2014you just want to put her in a padded box with a lock on it so no one can ever get to her and hurt her again, even if that\u2019s the worst thing you could do.\u201d He shook his head again and now his expression was readable. He was open. \u201cI apologize, man. I thought of you as my brother before you even glanced at Brie. I know she\u2019s safe with you.\u201d</p><p>Mike found himself chuckling. \u201cMan,\u201d he said. \u201cMel must have held you down and beat you over the head.\u201d</p><p>Now the expression got surly. \u201cI\u2019d just like to know why Mel always gets the fucking credit when I start to make sense. What makes you think I didn\u2019t just think it through and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Mike said, sticking out a hand. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d Jack took the hand and Mike\u2019s smile vanished. The look on his face became earnest. \u201cJack, I give you my word. I plan to do everything in my power to make your sister happy. I\u2019ll protect her with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d Jack said sternly. \u201cOr so help me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mike couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cAnd we were doing so good there for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be disappointed in me,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>Jack was quiet a moment, then said, \u201cThanks. I knew that. It just took me a while. Guys like us...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Mike laughed. \u201cGuys like us. Who\u2019d ever have thought?\u201d</p><p>Jack rubbed a hand across the back of his sweaty neck and said, \u201cYeah, well, look out. You bite the dust like I did and all of a sudden you\u2019re breeding up a ball team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be on the lookout for that,\u201d Mike said. \u201cShow me the house, Jack. Looks like it\u2019s coming along real well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll find Paul to give us a tour. I was going to make it good\u2014he\u2019s going to make it a masterpiece.\u201d</p><p>After about thirty minutes of looking at every detail of Paul\u2019s work, Mike saw Tom Booth\u2019s truck pull up. Tom parked, got out and dug into his job of cleaning up and hauling trash. Mike timed his approach; he shot the breeze with Jack and Paul as the sun was sinking. Jack finally left to get a quick shower so he could help serve dinner at the bar, and Paul went back into the house to check on the crew as they were finishing up.</p><p>Mike made his way to Tom. \u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cCould you give me a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Tom said, dropping the debris at his feet and pulling off his gloves. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to you about some parties a while ago and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I told you, Mike\u2014I dropped into a couple, just out of curiosity. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for something,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cDrugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugs?\u201d Tom asked. \u201cI saw a couple of joints passed around. I cut out. You know my dad. I\u2019d be in some military academy if I\u2019d been caught around that stuff. Maybe a penitentiary. I\u2019d be history. He\u2019s not a liberal kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mike said with a smile. \u201cI figured that one out all by myself. Actually, I was looking for something else. Something you don\u2019t see every day.\u201d</p><p>Tom\u2019s chin dropped and he looked down. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSon. Look me in the eye and say that.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his gaze. \u201cSeriously, I left when I saw a couple of joints come out. I got myself grounded for going somewhere they had beer. My dad, he\u2019s not the strictest dad on the books\u2014I\u2019ve had a beer with him. Innocent beer, no driving, no going out to a kegger in the woods, though. But...\u201d</p><p>Mike waited. \u201cBut?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI was already on my way out, and I suspected something was going on.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cCouple of kids breaking from the crowd, doing something a little sly, not gone long. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you suspect?\u201d Mike asked, his radar up.</p><p>\u201cHave no idea. Ecstasy, maybe? Meth? I don\u2019t know. Something sneaky. Man, I wanted no deeper than a beer, seeing a joint from a long, safe distance. I\u2019d be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHistory,\u201d Mike finished for him. \u201cWho threw the parties where you saw this?\u201d</p><p>Tom lowered his gaze again, shaking his head. Then before Mike asked him to look him in the eye, he raised his eyes and said, \u201cLook, I wouldn\u2019t mind getting the little shit in trouble\u2014I\u2019d love that. But really\u2014I have absolutely no idea what might have been going on. If I knew something and thought someone might get hurt, I\u2019d tell you everything, but I can\u2019t rat out a guy for drugs if he might\u2019ve just been exchanging phone numbers. You know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mike was quiet a long moment. Then he said, \u201cI know. Let\u2019s go over who was at those parties again, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>Twelve</p> <p>Of all the people in Virgin River Mel could have imagined having a positive mammogram, Lilly Andersen, who had borne and nursed seven children, was the last. Lilly, who was so dear to Mel. But there it was\u2014the radiologist called and said the X-ray was significant. Lilly should see a specialist immediately.</p><p>It didn\u2019t sit well with Mel that in addition to this probable diagnosis, Lilly had lost a great deal of weight recently. She hoped and prayed the weight loss was from chasing one-year-old Chloe around.</p><p>Chloe. Only four people knew the truth\u2014Mel, Doc, Lilly and Buck Andersen. Everyone thought Chloe had been an abandoned newborn whom Lilly had been fostering since Chloe was three weeks old. But Chloe was her flesh and blood. Lilly\u2019s own child.</p><p>Now she had to tell this woman that she might have breast cancer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lilly. But at least we caught it, and if it\u2019s not good news, you can concentrate on the treatment. I\u2019ve got you set up in Eureka for tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d she asked nervously.</p><p>\u201cThe sooner the better. Can Buck take you over there, or do you need me?\u201d</p><p>Lilly, so typical, smiled that gentle, comforting smile of hers, touched Mel\u2019s hand and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mel. I\u2019ll make Buck take a day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to talk to him? Because this is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can handle Buck. But they won\u2019t do anything like operate on me right away, will they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014but they\u2019ll do a biopsy. They might try to aspirate a lump or do more X-rays and blood work. If surgery is in order, I think they\u2019re going to get to it soon, however. The radiologist described the presence as significant. Have you felt a lump or lumps?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot really\u2014but I\u2019m large and kind of lumpy anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLilly, you\u2019re going to need help with Chloe. I really think you should tell your family the truth about Chloe. Your kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get by, Mel. I don\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried. Treatment now is good\u2014the survival rate for breast cancer is great. But if you have to undergo treatment, you might not feel well. It seems like they deserve to know. And they\u2019re all wonderful, to the last one. They won\u2019t hold it against you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t hold it against me, I guess no one would!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to remember\u2014if there\u2019s a reaction, it\u2019s only a reaction. And temporary, until the facts settle. Don\u2019t be afraid of them, Lilly. They adore you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lucky that way,\u201d she said.</p><p>But that was where Lilly\u2019s luck ended. Her breast cancer was advanced, aggressive and had spread to the lymph system and lungs. After a bilateral radical mastectomy, performed within a week of her visit with the surgeon, her new oncologist put her on a very strong regimen of radiation and chemotherapy. Chloe was living with her oldest sister, Amy, because Lilly was weak and ill.</p> <p>Sadly it was common in police work to realize immediately who the bad guys were, yet not have the kind of probable cause or evidence required for a search warrant or arrest. Mike had deluded himself that it would be simpler in a town so small, where everyone seemed to know everything that was going on. But he faced the same problems in Virgin River as he had encountered in L.A.</p><p>After talking to Tommy and to twenty other teenagers, he had lists of names spread across several parties that had taken place from last May to recent months. There might have been even more, but Mike didn\u2019t know about them. Mike made one trip to Garberville to talk to nineteen-year-old Brendan Lancaster, who, along with Tommy\u2019s ex-friend Jordan Whitley, were the only two boys at every party. The few other names that turned up more than twice were probably shills\u2014boys who were at the parties but didn\u2019t have a clue as to what was going on. Mike could tell in the interview\u2014the shills responded with confusion that seemed authentic, yet Whitley\u2019s and Lancaster\u2019s alleged confusion was obviously contrived. Very few girls\u2019 names turned up more than once.</p><p>Where Mike got confused was the combination of drugs that caused people\u2014girls, primarily\u2014to pass out and possibly other drugs that hyped them up. It was a weird combination. Could there be roofies and either ecstasy or meth at the same party? Sounded like a smorgasbord\u2014and a deadly one at that.</p><p>Mike was easily convinced that Tom Booth had no involvement with this group. He\u2019d gone to one party at the rest stop out of curiosity, stayed less than an hour and had seen it wasn\u2019t going anywhere good. He\u2019d decided to get out of there before it went south in a hurry. He\u2019d been to a friend\u2019s house a couple of times before he met and started dating his girlfriend; beer was available but he\u2019d never seen anyone passed out in any of those instances, probably because he\u2019d never stayed long. He didn\u2019t know many people, but he\u2019d given the names of the ones he did know, and the names added up, once again, to Whitley and Lancaster.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a clue,\u201d Mel told Mike. \u201cYour boy has chlamydia. If there\u2019s more than one boy with chlamydia, they\u2019re passing it around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t get to it,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you\u2019ll have to catch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Mike said, and a picture of him staking out a teen party waiting for these boys to drug and rape an unsuspecting young girl was enough to make him want to throw up. He thought he was probably going to have to get some help, which would mean going to the sheriff again, yet all he had was a list of names of teenagers who\u2019d been drinking, maybe smoking a little pot, and had nothing else to say. Until he came across something more significant, he had nothing to report to anyone. He\u2019d just have to keep talking to these kids, get Zach Hadley to sharpen his ears at the high school, maybe catch a break.</p><p>It was nearing Thanksgiving and Mike was caught up in this caper when Paul issued an invitation to a dinner at the general\u2019s house for Mike and Brie. It was Vanessa\u2019s idea to welcome Brie to the community\u2014a generous thought that was typical of her. While the general\u2014who had command of his kitchen\u2014and the women were occupied, Paul and Mike stood out at the corral with a couple of beers in the light dusting of a late-afternoon snow. They had just been talking about the fact that Tommy was working hard out at Jack\u2019s homesite, really earning his money by keeping the site clean of construction trash, when he came riding up from one of the back trails with a girl on another horse.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Romeo now,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cNew girlfriend?\u201d Mike asked, squinting into the distance.</p><p>\u201cThe wonderful Brenda. He\u2019s been after her forever. I think the horses finally cinched it for him.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Jesus, Mike thought. This is going to freak her out. \u201cAh... Listen, there\u2019s a situation. I\u2019ll try to explain later, but do me a favor, okay? When they get up here, drag Tommy out of here. Tell him you need his help\u2014firewood or something. I\u2019ll take care of his horse. I need a minute with the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything okay? Because she\u2019s a nice girl....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s a real nice girl. But I\u2019ve had a little business with her\u2014she\u2019s not in any kind of trouble, I promise. If I don\u2019t find a way to convince her I\u2019d never talk to anyone about her, Tommy might lose his main squeeze over something as dumb as nerves. Cop nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou been flashing that badge around, partner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the high school, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, crap,\u201d Paul said. \u201cYou better make this right because Tommy\u2019s got his head screwed on straight after a little trouble with his dad, and it just might be due to the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI can do this. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, just as Mike expected, Brenda looked stricken when she spied Mike at the corral. She actually pulled back on the reins and slowed her mount. Mike tried sending her a signal, a narrowing of eyes and very slight shaking of his head, but she was a little lost. Scared. No way she wanted this new boyfriend to know what she\u2019d gone through. No way she wanted to sit and tremble nervously through dinner with the cop.</p><p>\u201cTommy, buddy, help me out a sec, huh?\u201d Paul said. \u201cI need a hand getting in a load of wood. Mike will take care of your horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d he asked, dismounting. \u201cMaybe Mike should do wood while I help Brenda with the horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, his arm, you know\u2014still iffy. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay with the horse, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Mike said. \u201cYour girl here can show me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Mike\u2014this is Brenda. Brenda, Mike Valenzuela, friend of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Mike said, extending his hand to the young girl. She accepted it limply, silently, surprise and worry still etched on her face.</p><p>Mike watched over his shoulder as Paul led Tommy away, an arm around him as they walked up the hill toward the house. Brenda dismounted and led the horse toward the stable.</p><p>\u201cBrenda, don\u2019t panic. No one knows I\u2019ve talked to you about anything. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said nervously.</p><p>\u201cEasy does it,\u201d he said. \u201cTommy\u2019s a good catch. Don\u2019t cut and run because of me. I\u2019m not saying anything to anyone. I\u2019ve seen your folks at the bar ten times since we talked and haven\u2019t breathed a word. I told you, our conversation was in confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019ve been all over that school. People are talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re talking to me, too. Listen, there\u2019s something you ought to know about your boyfriend here\u2014I\u2019ve been getting to know him and I think he\u2019s solid. If there\u2019s stuff you\u2019re worried about him finding out, it might be better coming from you\u2014but that\u2019s just my opinion. I think he\u2019s a tough, fair kid. He\u2019s not going to get anything from me.\u201d</p><p>As she was leading her mount into the stable, she stopped. \u201cYou know more than you\u2019re saying. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou know who it was?\u201d she asked without giving him any specifics. But he already knew the specifics. He could continue to play dumb with her or he could go out on a limb and hope it paid off.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a victim. Can\u2019t make an arrest or prosecute a crime without a victim. And just like I\u2019m not telling anyone what you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there more than one person who could be that victim?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He looked into her eyes steadily. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Tears gathered in her eyes\u2014probably as the possibility of more girls going through what she\u2019d been through flashed through her mind. \u201cOh, my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, this isn\u2019t pretty, is it? Anytime you want to talk about this, work through it, you know how to reach me. I\u2019m not asking you to do anything, but I want you to try to trust me a little. I\u2019m going to give you some space, and I\u2019m never saying anything about your personal life, or my relationship with you unless you give me the okay. Get that? Let\u2019s take care of the horses. And act like we just hit it off. Huh? Instant friends...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do that,\u201d she said, emotional.</p><p>\u201cSure you do. We\u2019re going to have a nice dinner, a visit with the Booth family. I\u2019ll introduce you to Brie\u2014you\u2019re going to love her,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI bet she was a lot like you when she was sixteen. Good grades, nice boyfriends, great family.\u201d His smile deepened. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. You gotta trust me a little, Brenda. I never sold anyone out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat if you never get a victim so you can make an arrest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna get him anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to come up with ideas that don\u2019t involve you.\u201d</p><p>They got the saddles off and the tack out, then began brushing the horses. After about ten minutes she said, \u201cThanks. Mike.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, Brenda, I think we\u2019re on the same side. We don\u2019t want anyone else to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t yet been two weeks that Brie had been in Virgin River, but to Mike it felt as if they\u2019d been together forever. No matter what the evening held, whether supper at the grill and a quick walk across the yard to the RV, or dinner with the general and his family, when they were finally alone the door was barely closed before they were in each other\u2019s arms. They hadn\u2019t slept in a stitch of clothing since Brie\u2019s arrival and probably never would again. Mike thought about her all day and made long, slow, delicious love to her almost every night. Then there were the mornings...</p><p>\u201cNo one has this much sex,\u201d she whispered to him, breathless and satisfied.</p><p>\u201cEven I never had this much sex,\u201d he admitted, just as breathless.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a honeymoon, that\u2019s what it is,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been on two honeymoons, and they were nothing like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been on one, and it was nothing by comparison.\u201d She giggled. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Mike,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He rose over her and looked deeply into her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a passionate woman, Brie. You have a powerful libido. It\u2019s a good thing you chose a Latino.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWe have a reputation for being able to handle hot women like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou handle me, all right. Do you think this is going to wind down anytime soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf nature takes its course, it will. That\u2019s why I\u2019m taking advantage of you right now. I know what\u2019s coming in the pregnant days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t wait for the end of the day,\u201d she said. \u201cI shudder on and off all day long, just thinking...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAftershocks,\u201d he said, rolling onto his back. \u201cI have \u2019em, too.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle is what it is. I wasn\u2019t even sure I could do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>He rolled back onto his side and looked down at her. \u201cI came out of my coma with a few things missing. Erections, for one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d she asked, wide-eyed. \u201cBecause you\u2019re certainly having more than your share now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took almost a year to come back, and then it was completely unpredictable. When I took you to bed that first time, I didn\u2019t know if it would work, how well it would work, if it would keep working....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you went for it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI had responded to you before...I was hopeful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMendocino,\u201d she said with a smile.</p> <p>\u201cYou did know. I wondered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it hadn\u2019t worked that first night?\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand over her naked shoulder and down over her hip. \u201cHelping you become comfortable with a loving touch was all I wanted. Pleasing you was the only important thing. I was prepared to make up for it. In many wonderful ways.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cYou do have your ways,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He laughed, deep in his throat, and took great pride in working a little of his magic. Nothing in his life to this moment compared to the happiness he felt when she responded to him, when she was swept away by the pleasure he could give her. And sweeter still was holding her afterward, whispering in the night, or talking softly in the early-morning light. Whether it was love talk, usually only stirring them up all over again, or just the conversation of partners planning their days, their lives. Then there were conversations about children, about a house on a hill, about life together that took them into old age. All of it filled him up inside, gave him the substance that had been missing from his life. He\u2019d had women but this was the first time he\u2019d had a true partner.</p><p>Brie propped herself up on her elbow, meeting his smiling eyes, her hair falling over her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s almost Thanksgiving,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you want to stay here?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMel and Jack can\u2019t leave\u2014she has babies coming. Preacher and Paige are here\u2014that\u2019s family. If you want to go to Sam\u2019s, I\u2019ll do that with you. But I don\u2019t want to go to L.A. yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t keeping me a secret from the Valenzuelas, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no, I\u2019ve told them all, every one of them. I even told them to look out\u2014you\u2019re bilingual and tricky. But I\u2019m not ready to share you. In my mother\u2019s Catholic household, it would be separate bedrooms because we\u2019re not married. Even though I\u2019m thirty-seven and she knows we\u2019re living together\u2014it\u2019s her Catholic home. We could stay in a hotel, but I think we\u2019ll visit later. Just give me a little more time. I\u2019ve never been this happy in my life and all day long I look forward to when we\u2019re finally alone together.\u201d He played with the hair that fell to her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m greedy. This is the best my life has ever been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Christmas?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill your family be upset it we go to Dad\u2019s for Christmas? Because my whole family plus Mel\u2019s sister, brother-in-law and the kids will be there\u2014and I want to be with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be. We can join the Valenzuelas another time. You have to remember, mija\u2014my family is so large that my parents don\u2019t expect to have all the kids together with their own families every year. We\u2019ll do Christmas with them another year.\u201d</p><p>Thanksgiving fell on the last Thursday of the month and Preacher did the dinner in the bar. General Booth and his family were invited, but they drove down the coast to Bodega Bay to be with his sister and niece. There were several Virgin River folk who were included in Thanksgiving at the bar, people that Preacher and Jack had looked after for a long time, and it was a tradition to serve them the holiday meal in the bar. There was Doc and Hope McCrea, Connie and Ron of the corner store, Ricky\u2019s grandma Lydie, Joy and Bruce from just down the street. Now that Preacher and Jack were both married, they\u2019d close the bar on Christmas, but Preacher liked doing his Thanks-giving feast, keeping the bar open in case anyone who was alone straggled in.</p><p>When Mel, Jack and Davie arrived for dinner, Mel called her two patients who were close to due dates to see how they were doing, and when the report was that everything was status quo, she asked for her one glass of wine for the trimester. \u201cOne of my girls is running a tish late, while the other one has a habit of going early,\u201d she said, raising her glass to Brie. \u201cAny second now, we\u2019re having not one but two babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be so excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still get a little wound up, waiting. I live for the babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still feeling okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sick as a dog with this one. But I hang in. Jack promises he\u2019s not going to do this to me again. And I\u2019m leaning toward a surgical procedure while he sleeps.\u201d</p><p>The turkey was one of Preacher\u2019s very best and the side dishes were perfect. The pies had been made by Paige, who had developed some amazing culinary skills since coming to Virgin River. Preacher had proven to be not only a fabulous chef, but a wonderful teacher. And she was a very apt student who had seemed to find her niche in the kitchen with him.</p><p>Mel and Brie helped with the cleanup and Jack helped with the trash and sweeping up while balancing David on one hip. Mike wiped down the bar and tables but, even so, Preacher was busy cleaning up for so long that he missed Christopher\u2019s story time after his bath. He did go upstairs, however, to kiss the little guy good-night, because he found he just didn\u2019t get a good night\u2019s sleep without doing that. Then he trudged downstairs to close up the bar and go to his quarters, where he would lie platonically beside the woman of his dreams, waiting for her invitation indicating that enough time had passed. Every day he wondered when he\u2019d get permission to let it go. He really waited for ovulation day when he didn\u2019t have to hold anything back and which, by his calculations, was about a week away. And Paige was so regular, he had this figured almost to the minute.</p><p>When he walked into their bedroom he saw that Paige was sitting up in bed, pillows behind her, sheet drawn up over her naked breasts and a mysterious smile on her face. When he frowned and cocked his head, she pulled a pregnancy test stick out from under the sheets. \u201cTa-da,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did it, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Preacher almost fell down. His eyes actually welled up with tears. He put his hands up to his face to try to gain control, but he was overwhelmed. Three months of saving up, waiting for ovulation day, and he had begun to despair of them making a baby. But Mel was right! This is what it took! He could do this again, and again! But wait, he told himself. One baby at a time!</p><p>He went to the bed and fell to one knee beside it, grabbing on to that pregnancy stick. \u201cOh, God! Oh, baby! Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like it, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d he said, grabbing her, pulling her into his arms and holding her against his huge chest. \u201cOh, God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, John,\u201d she said, laughing.</p><p>He immediately let go of her. \u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cOf course not. But, John, if this little stick is accurate, you\u2019re all done saving up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige,\u201d he said in all seriousness, \u201cdo you think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, John, I think so. I\u2019m late for the first time ever, and the test is positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my Lord. Oh, my Lord. How do you feel? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually...I\u2019m pretty horny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he said, stunned.</p><p>\u201cOh, really. This saving-up business\u2014I guess you think you\u2019re the only one who missed it. Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... You got a little pissy there for a while....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, John, you told everyone it was ovulation day! You\u2019re going to have to learn to be a little more discreet in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you want, baby. Anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Take off your clothes. Come in here with me. Do that thing you do....\u201d</p><p>Mike drove out to Jack\u2019s homesite; it was the first week in December\u2014damp and cold. Preacher had taken a call at the bar and asked Mike to go break the news. Preacher would work on shutting down the bar and closing up the kitchen.</p><p>Jack and Paul were both inside installing cabinets; Paul\u2019s crew had already quit for the day and were in the trailer getting together an evening meal. The sun was low in the sky and Tommy Booth was still picking up scraps and dragging them to the Dumpster. Mike got out of his SUV and waited for Tom to turn back his way.</p><p>Mike walked over to Tom. \u201cI gotta get you home, buddy. It\u2019s bad news. It\u2019s Matt. There was an explosion. In Baghdad.\u201d</p><p>The expression on Tom\u2019s face was one of pure horror. He was frozen for a second and then he called out, \u201cPaul!\u201d It sounded as much like a scream as a shout. It was enough to bring Paul and Jack running to the porch of the house, and for some of the crew to appear in the doorway of the trailer.</p><p>Tom looked back at Mike. \u201cIs he dead?\u201d he asked in a terrified whisper.</p><p>Mike nodded and the tears instantly sprang to Tom\u2019s eyes. Mike grabbed his upper arm. \u201cLeave the truck. I\u2019ll drive you. I\u2019ll get the truck for you later. You have to be safe\u2014your sister has enough going on right now. She can\u2019t have anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>Tom sucked it back bravely. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said in a breath. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have to try to hold it together for her. We can meet up and fall apart later, bud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. Then he ran for Mike\u2019s SUV.</p><p>Paul jumped out of the house rather than walking down the plank where the porch steps would eventually be constructed. He ran to Mike, Jack right on his heels, questions shining in their eyes. \u201cThe Marine Corps is at the house, Paul. It\u2019s Matt. Car bomb in Baghdad. He\u2019s dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Paul said in a breath. \u201cVanni!\u201d burst from his lips. And he lit off for his truck before Mike had a chance to stop him.</p><p>\u201cJack, I sent Mel out to the house because of Vanni\u2019s pregnancy. You\u2019ll want to get over there. Brie will bring Davie in a little while.\u201d</p><p>Tom, Mike and Paul beat Jack to the house by mere seconds, but when he looked in the door what he found was a Marine Corps recruiter and a chaplain sitting uncomfortably in the great room while Walt stood beside his daughter. Tommy leaned on his dad and Paul knelt beside the ottoman on which Vanni sat, and held her in his arms. Before Jack could even enter the house, Mel drove up, parked and walked swiftly toward the house. Jack stopped her at the doorway. \u201cAre you up to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Jack. I should see Vanni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>Then he watched as his wife, medical bag in hand, went to her patient. Mel put a hand on Vanni\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cI\u2019m here, Vanni. I just want to be here,\u201d she said. What she didn\u2019t say was, to be sure you don\u2019t have any problems with your pregnancy on account of the news.</p><p>Shortly the house filled up even more. Preacher and Paige with Christopher, Brie with David. Preacher brought food that had been prepared for that night\u2019s dinner, plus a couple of bottles of good liquor.</p><p>Eventually the Marine contingent spoke with the general about arrangements and told Walt that a similar detachment had paid a visit to Matt\u2019s parents in Oregon once Vanni had been notified. They\u2019d be available to help with the burial, when those decisions were made.</p><p>Paul took Vanni to her room, glancing over his shoulder to Mel, indicating she should follow. Once there, Vanni lay back on the bed and cried helplessly. Paul sat beside her, gently rubbing her back. Mel quickly checked her vitals, listened to the fetal heartbeat and gave her a light sedative that wouldn\u2019t bother the baby.</p><p>This was the first time Mel became aware of a truly special bond between Paul and Vanni even though she\u2019d seen their reunion a couple of months before, even though she\u2019d heard Matt ask his best friend to look after his wife. Right now, in the moment, Vanni was completely dependent on Paul. Not on her father or brother, but on Paul, who continued to keep at least a hand on her, if not his arms around her. \u201cPaul, if you can, if it\u2019s all right with Vanni, lie down beside her and stay close for a while. The contact,\u201d she said. \u201cLoving contact is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She turned in his arms, nodding and sobbing, and he climbed onto her bed with her, drawing her close as she cried.</p><p>\u201cCall me if you need me. I\u2019ll be near,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>It was a long while before the sobbing finally subsided. Vanni\u2019s eyes were swollen and red, her breathing jagged. She turned to look at Paul and asked, \u201cDid he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he know he was going to die? I heard him ask you to take care of us if anything happened. It was almost as if he knew....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know. When it gets hot, you think like that. That\u2019s all it was. You always wonder. Plus, he knew without asking I\u2019d be here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d She wept again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get through it, Vanni. You have a lot of people around who love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll never see his baby. His son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure he will. You think he won\u2019t be watching? I know the guy\u2014he\u2019ll be watching.\u201d</p><p>They lay together on her bed and Paul held her. No one bothered them; no one checked to see if they were okay. Paul could hear the soft murmur of voices in the other room, but the only thing that mattered at the moment was Vanni and the baby. She faced him, her head on his arm, her belly pressed up against him, and he felt the baby move. Relief flooded him. It was bad enough that Vanni was going through this\u2014he couldn\u2019t have anything happen to the baby. Matt\u2019s baby.</p><p>The room was dark. There was a soft glow from the hallway from lights in the great room and kitchen spilling over. Vanni\u2019s breathing became even and calmer\u2014she slept, probably due to the sedative. He eased himself away reluctantly; he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to justify putting himself back on her bed, at her side, his arms around her, so it was hard to leave her.</p><p>In the great room he found all his friends. Waiting.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s asleep,\u201d he said. \u201cMel, I could feel the baby moving, so I guess he\u2019s okay, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in her last trimester\u2014the baby\u2019s pretty tough. Resilient. I\u2019m confident she\u2019ll carry, though she\u2019ll have a lot of emotional pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to call his parents?\u201d Walt asked Paul.</p><p>\u201cI can do that, yeah. Any idea what Vanni would want to do about the burial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to sit,\u201d Walt said. \u201cIf anything happened in Iraq, they\u2019d decided together that he\u2019s to come here. Not Virginia, where she\u2019s never going to live. Not Oregon, where their child isn\u2019t going to grow up. Do you think you can talk to his folks about that, or should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWhen you say here...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my land,\u201d the general said. \u201cI\u2019m always going to be here. This is going to be home base for Vanessa, at least. There\u2019s a kind of...the baby should have a link to his dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cAnd to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d Paul said. And he was beginning to long for the moment when he could be alone and grieve for his best friend. But it wasn\u2019t going to happen soon. He knew these people needed him to be strong.</p><p>A permit had to be obtained for burial on private property and a digging crew had to be hired from a cemetery in Fortuna. A site that could be seen from the house was chosen, up on a small rise under a big tree, a place from which a person could stand and see the many acres of General Booth\u2019s land. A contingent of Marines brought the body, a body it was not possible to view. It was never spoken of and no one really knew if it was a routine practice of the Corps to deliver an honor guard and twenty-one-gun salute to a ranch in the backwoods, or if a three-star general could whip that up with a phone call or two.</p><p>Folding chairs were placed around the grave site; Vanni sat between her father and brother right in front, Paul sat beside Tom, and beside the general sat Matt\u2019s parents. In the gathering, besides Preacher, Paige, Jack, Mel, Mike and Brie were Joe, Zeke, Josh Phillips and Tom Stephens. They were there more for Paul than anyone, because when one of them needed to be shored up by his brothers, the Marines arrived.</p><p>The flag was removed from the casket, folded with precision and presented to Vanni, who pressed it lovingly to her breast. The rifles fired; the bugle wailed.</p><p>Mel held Jack\u2019s hand and pulled it to her belly. There was a stirring inside and she looked up at him with a small smile. He leaned down to hear her whisper, \u201cDarling, you will never hear me complain about this baby again. Never. I thank God I have you...and your babies.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Despite everything, or perhaps because of everything, Christmas in Sacramento was filled with joy and laughter. Mel had many hands to help tend to David, allowing her to relax. Sam Sheridan\u2019s house throbbed with noise, food, love and celebration. Mike was pulled into the throng with enthusiasm, for the happiness that sparkled in Brie\u2019s eyes brought everyone\u2019s gratitude and relief.</p><p>Mel\u2019s sister, Joey, her husband, Bill, and their three kids joined the five Sheridan siblings, their spouses and, with David, nine little Sheridans, making it twenty-five in total, eleven of them camping out at Sam\u2019s house, using every bedroom, pull-out sofa, sleeping bag and beanbag.</p><p>The first night in town was a relatively quiet one, with Brie and Jack\u2019s sisters and spouses dropping in to say hello and welcome, heading back to their homes early, but on Christmas Eve it grew wild with everyone present at once. The street outside looked like a parking lot, dinner was big and messy and the dishes took forever to clean up, but the evening was young.</p><p>\u201cWe have a few traditions around here,\u201d Bob, the eldest of the brothers-in-law, said to Mike. \u201cIt starts on the patio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the patio!\u201d chimed in Ryan, the third in rank.</p><p>\u201cThis is where we come after dinner,\u201d Jack let him know. \u201cFirst drinks, then the cigars come out and eventually the brandy\u2014after which we generally have the women completely pissed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like home,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>As the women held their usual gathering in the family room, the space heaters on the patio were lit by Sam.</p><p>\u201cDo they do this at the Valenzuela house\u2014segregate by sex?\u201d Sam asked Mike.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but at my mother\u2019s home, the men take the garage, which holds a pool table and a refrigerator. In the refrigerator we have cerveza. It\u2019s kind of like a clubhouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I could get a pool table,\u201d Sam said thoughtfully.</p><p>Inside, the women were focused on pie, coffee and David, who was getting around very well and trying to pull himself up on furniture. He crawled around in his pajamas, ready to be put to bed once the noise level in the house subsided a bit. No one really seemed to notice when the doorbell rang. Donna, who was sitting nearest, answered. When she came back to the family room, she leaned down and whispered in Brie\u2019s ear. \u201cReally?\u201d Brie asked. \u201cHmm. Will you please get Mike for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, kitten.\u201d</p><p>Brie went to the door and found Brad in the foyer with a small gift-wrapped box and a large, gaily ribboned basket of wine, meats and cheeses. \u201cHi, Brad,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe you\u2019d had enough time to cool down now and think about things. I brought you something. This is for you, this is for the family.\u201d</p><p>He expects to be invited in, she thought. He still thinks we\u2019ll kiss and make up. He\u2019s crazy as a loon. \u201cI\u2019ll take this,\u201d she said, reaching for the basket. She put it on the hall table behind her. \u201cBut you should take that back. I\u2019ll give the family your regards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Brie. Give me a chance.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head sadly. \u201cBrad, you\u2019re much too late.\u201d</p><p>Mike came up behind her. She could sense his presence before she felt his hand on her shoulder. \u201cBrad,\u201d Mike said with a nod.</p><p>Brie reached up and put her hand over Mike\u2019s. He slipped his other arm gently around her waist, holding her against him. Last Christmas came to mind, when Brad was with the other woman and her children and Brie was here, lonely and hurt in this huge crowd of family. And now, with Mike\u2019s warmth against her, his arm around her, she couldn\u2019t remember feeling more secure.</p><p>A strange look came over Brad\u2019s face and a huff of laughter escaped him. \u201cNo way,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou should go, Brad,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Brad said in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019re not with this guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Brad,\u201d Brie said. \u201cHave a nice holiday.\u201d</p><p>Brad laughed. \u201cGod, I should\u2019ve known. He was at the hospital. That\u2019s why...\u201d</p><p>Brie turned to look up at Mike. She smiled at him. She\u2019d be damned if she\u2019d explain anything about their relationship to Brad.</p><p>Brad looked down uncomfortably. Then meeting Brie\u2019s eyes, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more sure of anything.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath and slowly turned, leaving Brie and Mike in the foyer alone. She leaned back against Mike and felt his breath on her neck. \u201cGod, I feel sorry for him,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do. It must be torture for him, knowing what he\u2019s lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he even realizes?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Brie\u2014he\u2019s a lot of things, but he\u2019s not stupid. He\u2019s figured it out by now. He gave up an incredible woman. The kind of strong, passionate woman who can commit to the forever thing, once her choice has been made. Not many chances like that come along for a man. Believe me\u2014I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might not understand that,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the short time we\u2019ve been a couple, you\u2019ve touched me in places he doesn\u2019t even know exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said, nuzzling her. \u201cNot because there\u2019s anything special about me. Because you hold nothing back. Do you wonder what was in the box?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot even curious. And there\u2019s a lot special about you. What do you want for Christmas, Mike?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d He turned her around and looked into her eyes. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have much effect on me anymore, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more questions about what went wrong?\u201d he asked, running a smooth knuckle down her cheek.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cSix months ago I couldn\u2019t think of many reasons to go on living. I had no idea I\u2019d find this kind of happiness with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I had a chance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were so kind to me. So patient and loving, waiting for me to be ready. And so passionate\u2014I couldn\u2019t resist you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy past concerns your brother.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHis past concerned the whole family. He should worry about his own transgressions.\u201d She gave him a little kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll worry about yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t afraid? Any fear that I don\u2019t know my heart?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhen I\u2019m with you, I don\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you take a chance on me? Let me make promises that I swear by the Virgin I can keep?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cDo you really want to get the Virgin involved in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore the babies come, mija,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause there will be babies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is that talk about the water in Virgin River....\u201d</p><p>He covered her lips in a steaming kiss, pulling her hard against him. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the water with us, mi amor,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we disappeared for a while, would we be missed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered, laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhen I woke up in the hospital, I thought to myself, why did I make it? When I was discharged and struggling for every step, unable to lift a glass from the cupboard, my constant thought was that I had misspent my life\u2014carousing, living in the moment, acting carelessly. What every man wants, what my friends had found\u2014that one woman they would give up everything for\u2014had eluded me completely. And when you came along...angry over your divorce and determined never to give a man, especially a man like me, a chance, I knew I\u2019d been cast into hell for sure, because I was feeling that for you.\u201d He gave her a kiss. \u201cHow did this happen? I know I don\u2019t deserve this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt started with a promise to break your heart,\u201d she said. \u201cSomehow I got distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me, Brie? I want you to be my wife. I want to be your husband, your partner for life. Can you trust me with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, Miguel. I trust you with everything.\u201d</p><p>It was the first Christmas in many years that Paul Haggerty hadn\u2019t spent in Grants Pass with his parents and brothers and their families\u2014because Vanessa needed him. She asked him if he would stay; she said it would make her Christmas a little easier. She didn\u2019t have to ask\u2014he would move heaven and earth for her.</p><p>The person who needed Paul as much, perhaps even more, was Tommy. The boy was crushed by his loss. He loved his sister more than the average seventeen-year-old boy dared admit, but he\u2019d begun to admire Matt in a heroic manner. He was enamored of his bravery and patriotism. He thought of him as a true brother.</p><p>It was typical of kids to take the opposite path of their parents, but even though Tom and his dad butted heads regularly, Walt had clearly raised a young soldier. Tom had been accepted into West Point already and was slated for at least a good long hitch in the Army, perhaps a career. This loss of Matt devastated him.</p><p>Paul tried to spend as much time as possible with Tom. He helped him take care of the horses and took him over to Jack\u2019s house to help out for a few hours here and there prior to Christmas. On Christmas morning a beautiful snow fell, dusting the pines and the trails, and they took a couple of the horses out for a ride.</p><p>\u201cYou think he was scared?\u201d Tom asked Paul out of the blue.</p><p>But of course there was no confusion about whom he was speaking. \u201cMaybe not at that moment, since the explosion was a complete surprise. But in that situation, everyone is scared. You wish you could crawl into your helmet and wait for it to pass. But damn, it\u2019s exhilarating, Tom. The training, the physical challenge, putting it all to the test when it really matters. When everything\u2019s at stake. Not a pay raise, not an extra day of vacation\u2014but your freedom. Your wife\u2019s freedom, your son\u2019s, your parents\u2019. You think about that when you\u2019re really up against it\u2014that there\u2019s purpose in what you\u2019re risking. Great purpose. That\u2019s what keeps pulling men like Matt back. Men like Jack. Jack did a twenty. If Matt had made it twenty, he\u2019d have been as decorated as Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I have the stuff,\u201d Tom said. \u201cI want to do well, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to go that route if you don\u2019t feel it. It\u2019s got power. The power of conviction. It\u2019s full of adrenaline. The rush. It\u2019s hard enough when you do feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>Paul shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that, son. I wasn\u2019t sure till I was there. For us, me and Matt, it was Iraq the first time, and it was nothing compared to this. But once I got there, I knew I was supposed to be there. That\u2019s when we met Jack Sheridan, Preacher and Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you got out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reserves was enough for me, but that ended in Fallujah\u2014where I took a bullet and donated a spleen. Okay by me\u2014I wanted to serve, but I didn\u2019t want that career. I have the career I want. I love building houses. The most important thing for you to remember is you don\u2019t have to make this decision now. You have years before you have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Vanni\u2019s going to be all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot right away. She\u2019s going to have to grieve him. Eventually, though, she\u2019s going to get on with her life because she has that gift, that love of life. I\u2019ve never known a woman as alive as Vanni. And she\u2019ll have a son to raise. She\u2019ll be okay. Just a matter of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear her at night. Crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>They took the horses on a path along the narrow end of the river that cut through the general\u2019s property and Paul pulled back on the reins. \u201cTommy,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOver there.\u201d</p><p>At the water\u2019s edge was the most magnificent buck Paul had ever seen. Drinking from the river, he had twelve points, six by six, a thick white throat, a long, handsome snout and black nose. God, he was beautiful. \u201cThere\u2019s an old guy. He\u2019s dodged the hunters for a few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at him,\u201d Tom said. \u201cI\u2019d never be able to shoot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis meat might be a little tough anyway,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to start bringing a camera with us.\u201d</p><p>They sat in silence and admired the stag. One of the horses whinnied and the deer\u2019s head came up. He sniffed the air and then turned and ran into the trees.</p><p>\u201cYou think it hurt him?\u201d Tom asked. And again Paul knew it was Matt of whom they spoke.</p><p>Paul reached across the distance that separated them and put a firm hand on his shoulder. \u201cSon, he didn\u2019t feel a thing. He might be wandering around heaven right now, wondering what the hell hit him. No pain. And I\u2019m not just speculating\u2014your dad got in touch with his platoon commander.\u201d</p><p>As they headed back to the house, Tom said, \u201cTell me about Jack. About these guys...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWhen Matt and I met him, he was already a marksman, a sniper, a decorated Marine, and we were kids. I served under him again when my reserve unit was called up\u2014that\u2019s the group that still hangs tight. By the time Jack retired he held more medals than I could count. He saved a lot of lives\u2014he served in five combat zones. He went in as a boy, but damn, he must have had some instinct about it because he was a huge success, a bona fide war hero. Then when he got out, he came to Virgin River and rebuilt that cabin into the bar and grill, married Mel when she got here and seemed like this pretty regular small-town guy.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s no ordinary small-town guy\u2014he\u2019s still a fighting Marine. There was an incident\u2014a guy came out of the woods in the middle of the night, looking for drugs at Doc\u2019s. Mel was staying there. He broke in, put a knife to Mel\u2019s throat, threatened to kill her for the drugs. Doc heard something and called Jack, who was asleep at the bar across the street. He grabbed his handgun, a nine millimeter, and ran. He managed to get on a pair of jeans and that\u2019s all. Half-dressed, barefoot, a couple of big tattoos on those huge arms of his, and I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen that killer look he can get on his face\u2014he must have looked like a wild man. He kicked in the door at Doc\u2019s and was face-to-face with this lunatic holding his woman, big serrated knife to her throat, and he had a little, bitty target.\u201d He held up his thumb and forefinger. \u201cRight next to Mel\u2019s face. Now, you can see how he is with Mel\u2014he worships her. No way he\u2019d ever risk her life. But it took him about a second to make up his mind, to act. He took the guy out. Shot him in the head, killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did. He\u2019s the kind of guy who never hesitates. But he knows what he\u2019s doing\u2014he knows what he can and can\u2019t do. Knows what he has to do. And then he does it\u2014clearheaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a stud,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>Paul laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Mike? Valenzuela?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike? After our first hitch, he went to LAPD and stayed in the reserves, like I did. We were activated at the same time. We had some hard fighting in Iraq, but he got through that with a couple of medals. He held off insurgents at Fallujah, saving the whole squad. Joe and me were bleeding all over the place, and so were some others, but Mike kept them back till Jack and the rest of the platoon could effect a rescue. But then about a year ago back in L.A., as a police sergeant in a gang unit, he got taken out by a fourteen-year-old gangbanger in a playground. He took three bullets and it almost killed him. LAPD retired him and he came up here to recuperate\u2014Mel helped him with his physical therapy. Now he\u2019s the town cop\u2014bet he never saw that coming. And you already know about Brie, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s no secret and you\u2019ll hear about it sooner or later. Brie was a Sacramento ADA, an assistant district attorney. She put away a lot of dangerous criminals, but then she prosecuted a serial rapist and lost the trial. The guy had brutally raped a bunch of women, and he walked. And then he raped and beat Brie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on\u2014are you shitting me?\u201d Tommy asked, appalled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s what went on. Mike told me that they\u2019ve found the guy and there will be a trial. Brie is determined she\u2019s going to testify against him and put him away so he can\u2019t do this to anyone else, ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Tommy said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Paul said.</p> <p>\u201cRight here. These stories. This little dinky place full of big trees and pretty rivers and good-looking deer, and people are performing heroic acts and living out these huge dramas. Every day.\u201d</p><p>Paul laughed. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t even told you about Preacher. And Paige.\u201d</p><p>Christmas dinner at the Booth household was served at six\u2014small and somber. Paul and the general cleaned up the kitchen and not long afterward Vanni just went to bed. Paul knew she wasn\u2019t sleeping well, as he could often hear her in the night. But she continued to go to bed earlier and earlier. Paul suspected she wanted to be alone, to grieve, to cry without impacting the rest of the household.</p><p>When it was down to just the men, Paul excused himself to run into town to pay a call on Paige and Preacher, and Tom took his little red truck in the same direction, to visit Brenda.</p><p>When Tom got to Brenda\u2019s house it was still all lit up, and it looked as if there were a lot of people inside. He knew he should\u2019ve called, but he hadn\u2019t been thinking straight lately. When he rang the bell, she answered. \u201cHey,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cTommy! Hi! Wanna come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014I was wondering if you could come out. For a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me ask my mom,\u201d she said. \u201cHere, step inside. Come on.\u201d She pulled his hand and he let himself be drawn into their house.</p><p>The moment Brenda\u2019s mom saw him, she stood up from her place at the table with Brenda\u2019s dad, brothers and sister, grandma and grandpa and a couple of other people. She went straight to him and put her arms around him. \u201cHow are you, Tommy?\u201d she asked, giving him a motherly hug. \u201cYou getting by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing all right,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cSorry. I should\u2019ve called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey. How\u2019s Vanessa doing?\u201d</p> <p>He hoped he wouldn\u2019t get choked up. \u201cUm. She\u2019s having a pretty hard time. I think it\u2019s going to be a while. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Brenda asked. \u201cOkay if I go out with Tommy for a little while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, honey. Don\u2019t be too late. Tommy\u2014keep an eye on the time,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I will, Mrs. Carpenter.\u201d He held Brenda\u2019s coat for her. Then held her hand as he took her down the porch steps and out to his truck. Once they were in the truck, still sitting out in front of her house, still holding her hand, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bren. I haven\u2019t called. I haven\u2019t given you any attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really expect anything, Tommy. I understand\u2014it\u2019s a really rough time. You feeling any better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight this minute, with you, I feel a lot better. Can we drive out to the woods? Maybe Jack\u2019s homesite? Brenda, I just have to hold someone.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cYou\u2019re my first and only choice.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hand. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He put the truck in gear and headed out of town. \u201cYou know\u2014you\u2019re about the best thing that\u2019s happened to me since I got here. If I weren\u2019t going with you, this year would be\u2014it would be total crap.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed a little. \u201cI feel the same way. My year didn\u2019t start out real good, either. It wasn\u2019t half as tough as yours, but it was still pretty crappy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been so great to me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been pretty good to me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it. A lot of girls are real complicated. Ever since we started talking, going out, you\u2019ve been awesome. You don\u2019t worry about little shit, you don\u2019t get all moody, you\u2019re just so\u2014 Brenda, you\u2019re the best girl I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You\u2019re pretty much the best guy I\u2019ve ever known. There\u2019s only one thing wrong with you as far as I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he said, smiling in spite of himself. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going away next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s that. Could be a long year. But I\u2019ll get leave\u2014I\u2019ll be back here to visit. And you can always pick a school not so far from West Point when it\u2019s your turn. People do that, you know. Actually date for a long time. Go steady for a long time. Of course, that\u2019s all up to you\u2014I don\u2019t expect anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be all right to ask, though,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t tie you down your senior year,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe you don\u2019t want to be tied down your freshman year?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t think they let the little guys out much at West Point the first year. And second, if I knew you were my girl, I wouldn\u2019t even have to think about it. Being tied down to you\u2014that would be worth my time, no kidding.\u201d He pulled off the road up to the top of the hill where the house was being built. He stopped the truck, leaving it running, and put on the dome light. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d He opened the glove box and withdrew a small, wrapped box. \u201cI bought this before... Before Matt... I had this big deal planned for giving it to you\u2014a real nice night out, something special. For sure not sitting in my truck in the woods. Open it, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to get me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t have to. Don\u2019t you think I wanted to?\u201d</p><p>She tore into it and found a gold ID bracelet with her name on the topside and underneath, \u201cWith love, Tom.\u201d She read it aloud. \u201cGod, it\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s just beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it! Here, put it on me.\u201d</p><p>Once the bracelet was latched, he put his hand against her soft hair. \u201cI do, you know. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it back. I know I\u2019m rushing you a little. Think it\u2019ll get me kissed, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least,\u201d she said with a smile. She leaned toward him across the console, her hands on his shoulders while his found her waist, and the kiss was good. Hot and openmouthed. She made little noises while she kissed him, and he loved that. Kiss at an end, she said, \u201cThank you. It\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever been given.\u201d</p><p>All he wanted was to feel her warmth against him, and this wasn\u2019t getting it. Their make-out sessions had been a lot more comfortable than this\u2014either at her house when no one was home, or out riding, on the soft ground under a tree, or in fresh clean hay in the stable. \u201cI have an idea,\u201d he said, turning off the truck.</p><p>He went around to her side, opened her door and said, \u201cCome with me. Let\u2019s hope Uncle Paul doesn\u2019t lock things up too tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d she asked, laughing, going with him.</p><p>He pulled her to the fifth wheel and, God bless Paul, the door swung open. He stepped up inside and pulled her up and right into his arms, covering her mouth with a passionate kiss. Then he pulled her down onto Paul\u2019s bed and held her there, tight. Close. \u201cGod, that\u2019s better. That is so much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy... You\u2019re not thinking we\u2019re going to, you know, do it...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope we do it, Bren. But it\u2019s not going to be tonight. I\u2019m not lying\u2014I just have to feel you next to me. I\u2019ve been feeling so damn empty. And alone. I just wanna hold you. So bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I bet you have a rubber in your pocket.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her and buried his face in her neck. \u201cI\u2019m a seventeen-year-old guy. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s staying in my pocket, don\u2019t you worry. We seventeen-year-old guys, we don\u2019t even want to carry \u2019em. But it\u2019s the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so funny....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, this is working,\u201d he said. \u201cSnuggle up here, baby. You feel so good. Hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d he said, pulling her closer. \u201cThat\u2019s so nice to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if we fall asleep here, we\u2019re history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d He laughed. Then he slipped a hand against her breast, and she covered his hand with hers. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna fall asleep, Brenda. We\u2019re gonna get all hot and bothered for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said against his lips. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Preacher unlocked the door to the bar and let Paul in. They shook hands tight and hard, bringing them shoulder to shoulder. \u201cHey, man,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, my man. How was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was okay. Come on in. Paige told me to call her when you got here, then we\u2019ll have a drink. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what I need,\u201d Paul said, going to the bar.</p><p>Preacher called back to his quarters, then went behind the bar. \u201cHow\u2019s it going out there at the general\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal tough,\u201d he said. \u201cReal, real tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t even imagine.\u201d He pulled down a couple of glasses. \u201cVanni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hanging in there, but I can see the pain in every damn breath she takes. God, Preach\u2014that girl is hurting all over. She\u2019s trying so hard to be brave, especially over these holidays, it just kills me to look at her. And she\u2019s growing by the minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good, though, that she\u2019s got that baby in her. That little bit of him. There has to be some consolation in that.\u201d He tipped a bottle over two glasses. \u201cAnd it\u2019s good you\u2019re there. I know she needs you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a great idea. We spend an awful lot of time talking about Matt, and we\u2019ll have some fun things to remember, but it always ends up with her in tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can get around that, man. She\u2019s gonna cry. At least she has a good friend to hold her up while she\u2019s doing it.\u201d Preacher touched his glass to Paul\u2019s. \u201cIf something happened to me and I left Paige with a baby in her, I hope to God one of my boys would be there for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s automatic, Preach,\u201d Paul said, taking a drink.</p><p>Paige came into the bar and walked straight into Paul\u2019s arms, giving him a big hug. \u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing okay, Paige. Thanks. How about you guys? How was your Christmas? I bet the little guy had a big day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know he did. He now has everything but a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe man here spoil you like you deserve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been sitting on a little news. We\u2019re having a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, damn!\u201d Paul said. He looked at Preacher and grinned. \u201cYou finally came through on ovulation day, huh, buddy?\u201d</p><p>He puffed up a little. \u201cI did at that,\u201d he said, throwing his chest out.</p><p>\u201cAnd John promises that in the future when we have personal business, like we\u2019re going to have sex all day and I\u2019m going to stand on my head between rounds, he\u2019s not going to tell the town. Or the one-ninety-second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, I think we took it pretty much in stride,\u201d Paul said, but he couldn\u2019t help grinning. \u201cThat\u2019s awful good news, Paige. I\u2019m really happy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s not that easy,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cBeing married to someone like Paige and waiting for ovulation day. I think I did pretty good there. I should get a little more credit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI imagine it\u2019s pretty tough.\u201d Paul laughed. \u201cYou know, I needed that. Some great news, a good laugh. Congratulations to you both.\u201d He lifted his glass. \u201cThis last year has been awful tough. The past month has been pure shit. Let\u2019s toast a new year, with new stuff, good stuff. Here\u2019s to the new baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll just say hear, hear, and leave you boys to your business.\u201d Paige got up on her toes and pressed a kiss onto Paul\u2019s cheek. \u201cWe realize that you have some grief business going on, Paul. You kind of get lost in the shuffle with Vanni going through such a terrible time, but if you ever need to talk, escape, break down or blow off steam, we\u2019re here for you.\u201d</p> <p>He gave an appreciative nod. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said.</p><p>Paul and Preacher talked a little while longer, then said good-night. It was in Paul\u2019s mind to go somewhere he could be alone and either hit something, cry or maybe scream, and he couldn\u2019t really think of anywhere other than the homesite. So he drove out there. But when he entered the clearing, he saw Tommy\u2019s truck. He killed his lights immediately. He assumed they were parking, Tom and Brenda. Then he saw that the truck was empty.</p><p>Oh, damn, he thought. Tommy was in a lot of pain. He was needy and vulnerable, seventeen and in either the trailer or the fifth wheel with his girl. Paul knew that Tommy hadn\u2019t seen much of Brenda in the past couple of weeks, given the events. And tonight of all nights, he was not only with her, he was way too alone with her. And there was a goddamn bed in that trailer.</p><p>Paul backed up, turned around and didn\u2019t put the lights on again until he was facing away from the trailer. He drove back to the general\u2019s house, let himself in and found Walt asleep in the chair, TV on and newspaper hanging off his lap. He roused when he heard Paul moving around. \u201cEvening, sir,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cHmmmph,\u201d he grunted. \u201cI must have nodded off. How was Christmas for Paige and Preacher?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThey have some big news. Paige is expecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, he did it,\u201d the general said with a chuckle. \u201cHe showed up for ovulation day.\u201d</p><p>Paul laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s in a lot of hot water for telling too many people about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I suppose. But it\u2019s so like him, don\u2019t you think? He\u2019s so damn transparent.\u201d He stood up and stretched. \u201cI\u2019m going to turn in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind if I sit up? The TV won\u2019t bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself.\u201d The general extended his hand to Paul and Paul took it. \u201cThanks for staying on,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it\u2019s damn hard on you, son. And I know you\u2019re here because Vanni asked you to be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever she needs me to do, sir. I gave Matt my word. And I\u2019m awful fond of Vanni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man,\u201d he said, giving him a slap on the arm. And he went off down the hall, his step a little slower.</p><p>This has aged the hell out of him, Paul thought. He\u2019s buried a few hundred soldiers, but this one is taking its toll.</p><p>At ten Paul turned on CNN. At eleven he checked the news out of San Francisco. At twelve he was starting to think about driving out to the homesite, but at twelve-thirty the front door finally opened. Tommy was clearly surprised to find him up. \u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re awake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Paul said, still undecided about exactly the best way to handle this. But it had to be handled while there was still the opportunity for a save, and neither the general nor Vanni was up to the job.</p><p>\u201cGood. I need to talk to you about something, man. Let me get a soda. Want anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Tom came back to the great room with a soda, sat opposite Paul and scooted up to the edge of his seat. A little on the nervous side, Paul thought. \u201cYou want to take your coat off?\u201d Paul asked.</p> <p>\u201cOh. Yeah,\u201d he said, putting his soda down and shrugging out of his coat. \u201cListen, I have to tell you something. I kind of borrowed your trailer tonight\u2014I hope that doesn\u2019t piss you off.\u201d</p><p>Paul raised his eyebrows, waiting.</p><p>\u201cIt was a situation. I would\u2019ve asked your permission, but I swear I didn\u2019t plan it at all. It was real sudden. But hey, it worked out great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to attempt an explanation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Yeah. I had a Christmas present for Brenda. I bought it before... Before everything happened. I had this big idea I was going to take her somewhere nice\u2014like maybe over to the coast to dinner or something, but the shit hit the fan. So I took her out to the site to park where I could give her this beautiful bracelet I bought her.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWith your money, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happened?\u201d Paul asked coyly.</p><p>\u201cWell, it worked pretty good. She loved it. It was good for many kisses, if you want to know. But that damn little truck, you know? So I got this idea\u2014I spotted your fifth wheel and helped myself to it. Honest to God, Paul, I would\u2019ve asked\u2014but I didn\u2019t even think of that ahead of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. Were you having teenage sex in my trailer?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no!\u201d Tommy said. \u201cJeez, man, I\u2019m not having sex with Brenda!\u201d Then he smiled. \u201cI am having some very nice making out with her, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Tommy\u2014maybe we should talk....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, save it. I\u2019ve had this talk a hundred times. I\u2019m not having sex, much to my disappointment. I\u2019d love to be having sex, don\u2019t get me wrong. But Brenda\u2019s a nice girl, and she doesn\u2019t move fast\u2014which I happen to like, by the way. And besides, I\u2019m still a virgin. You tell anybody that, I\u2019ll have to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Paul felt himself smile. \u201cSo, what did you do in my trailer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Paul. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little nosy on your part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the circumstances...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, I just wanted to feel something soft up against me, you know? This month has been so ugly. So horrible. Tonight was actually nice. We just kind of held each other, made out like rock stars and\u2014\u201d He got this look on his face, this dreamy faraway look. \u201cShe said she loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa! Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it was the bracelet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive yourself a little credit,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving myself credit for thinking of the bracelet. God, she is so hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t use my fifth wheel to make out in,\u201d Paul said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to end up having sex. I can smell it. I\u2019d feel like an accomplice or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you are. At least not anytime soon. Brenda\u2019s pretty worried about stuff like that. So...when did you actually lose it? You know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was over seventeen,\u201d Paul said, smiling. \u201cI think that\u2019s graphic enough. Do you have condoms, in case...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d he said. \u201cAsk yourself. Did the general give the boy condoms? Holy shit, Paul\u2014he watched me stretch \u2019em over bananas. I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t make me model one. He\u2019s probably counting \u2019em every day when I go to school. I kind of want to throw a few away just to get his heart rate up. Yeah, I have condoms. And\u2014I\u2019m not willing to rely on condoms, how\u2019s that? I\u2019m not having sex with anyone who doesn\u2019t also have her own birth control\u2014and we haven\u2019t had that conversation, me and Brenda. You happy yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to take advantage of Brenda. I really care about her. Nothing that risky is going to happen between us until it\u2019s right for her. And when it\u2019s right for her, she\u2019s going to be safe and I\u2019m going to make her safer. She\u2019s important to me, man. I\u2019m not going to mess her up.\u201d</p><p>Damn, Paul thought. The boy\u2019s got serious game. \u201cYou can\u2019t use my fifth wheel to make out in,\u201d he said, but he grinned when he said it because jeez, the boy was so cute. It made him nostalgic. He remembered a certain prom date that he was sure, sure was going to be it for him. It wasn\u2019t. It came later, when he least expected it. Paul found himself almost hoping the kid could get lucky. \u201cYou understand, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But you\u2019re not pissed off about tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I can live with it. You\u2019re sure nothing scary happened? Because if it did, even with a condom, we can still get ahead of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know about that, too. The little morning-after pill. Believe me, the only thing I don\u2019t know about sex is how good it feels.\u201d</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>It came too soon\u2014the trial against Jerome Powell for rape. In the third week of January Brie and Mike returned to Sacramento so that she could testify against him. They went ahead of time so that Brie could be prepped. When the trial date arrived, Jack was determined to be there, but Mel couldn\u2019t leave her women\u2014Lilly had grown very ill and Vanni was in advanced pregnancy and in a state of grief. Paige and Preacher promised to back her up, as did John Stone, but still, it was very hard for Jack to leave her.</p><p>While jury selection and opening arguments were presented, Brie sat in the same room with her rapist. With her were her partner, her brother, her father, her sisters. She was definitely shored up\u2014but the fact was she could have had the entire Marine Corps marching band sitting with her and she would still have felt shaken and vulnerable. She revisited the crime in her mind, over and over. They were all hoping that this ordeal could be dispensed with quickly.</p><p>There was a good case against Powell. Even though he\u2019d worn a condom so as not to leave his DNA behind, the rape kit performed on Brie at the hospital had turned up hair, plus they\u2019d found her gun in his possession. He claimed to have found it.</p><p>However, the defense had been able to suppress any testimony of earlier arrests or trials, which precluded Brie from explaining that her positive ID was based on the fact that she had prosecuted him. Since she had failed to convict him, she couldn\u2019t testify to that. The defense suggested she might falsely accuse him in a rage at having lost the case against him.</p><p>Brie didn\u2019t have to be in court as often as she was\u2014she could have waited to be called to testify. But she wanted to get used to seeing him, to bolster herself before her testimony, and she wanted him to see her, to know how it was going to go down. The prosecutor was not going to accept a plea agreement under these circumstances, the crime being retribution against an officer of the court.</p><p>But seeing him every day didn\u2019t bolster her, or calm her. Now she knew exactly how her witnesses had felt. Brie barely slept, had trouble eating and felt as though she were vibrating under her skin. The illogical reaction\u2014all emotional\u2014was hard for her to accept. After all, he was in custody; he couldn\u2019t reach her. And right beside her were two powerfully strong men who would stop at nothing to keep her safe. Yet the very sight of him was making her sick.</p><p>Jerome Powell was six feet tall, tan from his stay in Florida, his blond hair thick and floppy, his jaw square. He had a big smile, one that certain women could be drawn to. He had very large hands, strong arms from working construction and was powerfully built. His eyes were dark, close together and sunken under hooded brows.</p><p>He glared at Brie. Sometimes he smiled at her, which made her stomach turn. Every time he turned his head to look at her, she felt Jack and Mike tense beside her. She looked up at their profiles, her lover and her brother, and watched the dangerous tics and tension in their expressions. These were completely fearless men\u2014Jerome Powell should be as afraid of getting off as going to prison. But he sat calmly, unafraid, arrogant.</p><p>In the evening, conversation at Sam\u2019s was subdued and superficial. Mike, Jack and Sam took to the patio after dinner while one or two of Brie\u2019s sisters dropped by the house to spend time with her, being there for her. And at night, in bed, Mike would curl himself protectively around her, holding her closely, whispering to her that he loved her, that he was proud of her, that he could not imagine her courage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI could not get through this without you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI think you could, you\u2019re that strong. But I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t have to. You\u2019ll never have to go through anything alone again.\u201d</p><p>When the day for Brie to testify finally arrived she went bravely and calmly to the stand to be sworn in. No testimony about her prosecution of him for previous crimes could be admitted by the prosecutor, so she was left to describe the details of her rape. As she took her seat and looked into the courtroom, she saw Brad in the back. Well, she thought, he was a part of it all, like it or not. Maybe they could all get their closure and get on with their lives.</p> <p>\u201cI had to work late and wasn\u2019t home until after midnight. I opened the garage door, but I parked in the drive because the garage was full of junk that I\u2019d been meaning to clean out for months. My car door wasn\u2019t even closed when I was grabbed from behind, by the hair. He smashed my head into the top of the car. Then an arm came around my neck, choking me. I dropped my briefcase and was trying to get into my purse. I carried a gun. But the purse was flung away\u2014I\u2019m not sure if he did it or if I lost control of it in the struggle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you struggle, Ms. Sheridan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fought with everything I had, and he hit me, three or four times in the face. I blacked out for a moment. When I came to, I was on the ground and he was leaning over me. He was smiling. It was so evil, so terrifying, I froze. That\u2019s when he reached under my skirt and tore my hose and my underwear off. Well, not off. Down. He held a hand around my throat to keep me still while he undid his trousers with his other hand. I was choking.\u201d</p><p>She looked at her brother and Mike. Jack frowned and looked down, but Mike held her gaze. Steady. She knew that inside he was in terrible pain, hearing what she\u2019d been through, but for her he kept a strong front, chin up, eyes level.</p><p>\u201cDid he say anything?\u201d the prosecutor asked.</p> <p>\u201cObjection. Your Honor?\u201d</p><p>The judge put his hand over the microphone and leaned toward Brie. \u201cCan you answer the question without introducing any prohibited information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. She had to focus on the lawyers\u2019 faces. \u201cHe said, \u2018Look at me. I want you to see my face. I\u2019m not leaving any evidence behind. I\u2019m not going to kill you. I want you to live.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did that make you feel safe?\u201d the prosecutor asked.</p><p>\u201cHe was putting on a condom as he said that. When it was on, he raped me, holding me down at the neck. I thought I was going to choke to death. I felt like I was being ripped apart. When he was done, he pulled his pants up and I watched\u2014that condom went with him, inside his pants. Then he stood up and kicked me several times. I lost consciousness.\u201d She went on to describe the injuries she sustained as photos taken at the hospital were passed around the jury box. Her voice was steady, her words well chosen and clear, but tears ran down her cheeks and dripped onto hands folded in her lap. And inside, her stomach churned violently. It was almost enough to double her over.</p><p>\u201cDid he say anything else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cObjection! Your Honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSustained,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I have for now,\u201d the prosecutor said.</p><p>The defense attorney got up and started asking her questions about the time of night, whether she was tired, did she wear glasses, was it dark or was the drive well lit, all aimed at throwing doubt on her ability to make an ID. The room began to sway before her eyes and she wavered a bit. The judge leaned over and asked her if she could continue. \u201cYou\u2019re looking a little pale,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just do it,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>The defense took up an hour with questions about her schedule, her health, her mental stability, even her divorce. Finally he said, \u201cDid you pick the suspect out of a lineup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He fled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the police show you photos?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did look at photos, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that was how long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven months ago,\u201d she said, and her face glistened in sweat.</p><p>\u201cDo you see the man you identified in this room? This man you identified to police as your rapist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight there,\u201d she said, pointing. \u201cJerome Powell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re confident that a man you identified from a photo seven months ago is this man?\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up, her eyes wide, at attention. The prosecutor in her had kicked in.</p><p>\u201cYes or no, Ms. Sheridan.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward. \u201cNo,\u201d she answered.</p><p>By the look on his face, the defense attorney immediately knew what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cYour Honor, may we approach?\u201d Brie\u2019s lawyer asked.</p><p>The lawyers went to the bench and a heated argument ensued, every bit of which Brie could hear. The prosecutor argued that he was entitled to explore that last answer while the defense argued that it would ultimately introduce testimony on evidence not allowed. At length the judge admonished the defense attorney that he had opened the door and the prosecution could proceed.</p><p>\u201cMs. Sheridan,\u201d the prosecutor asked, \u201chow is it you\u2019re not confident that the man you identified from the photo is this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I looked at photos, but I didn\u2019t identify him from a photo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you identify your rapist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave the police his name. I knew him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was an assistant district attorney when he raped me. I had just prosecuted him for the serial rape of six women\u2014and I lost.\u201d</p><p>So much noise erupted in the room that the judge had to bang his gavel several times and threaten to clear the courtroom.</p><p>When the din had finally subsided, the prosecutor asked her, \u201cDid he say anything else to you, Ms. Sheridan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to kill you. I want you to try to come after me again, and watch me walk again.\u2019\u201d</p><p>The place went crazy with gasps and murmurings, the judge banging his gavel again and again. But it was at that moment that Brie allowed herself to look again at Mike. Her lips curved in a very small smile as she locked eyes with him. Even at that distance she could feel the pride in his gaze. Love and pride and commitment. He smiled at her and gave a small, almost imperceptible nod. She\u2019d done it. She\u2019d got him. It was why she\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I have for Ms. Sheridan,\u201d the ADA said.</p><p>The defense tried to recover, asking Brie if there was any chance she was out to get this guy, since she had failed to convict him before. Her voice clear and strong, even knowing that possibility would be contained in the defense attorney\u2019s closing arguments, she said, \u201cAnd leave another rapist out there? My rapist? The police not even searching for him because they thought they had the suspect? Not hardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you couldn\u2019t identify your rapist, Ms. Sheridan, and saw your chance to go after the defendant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObjection,\u201d the prosecutor shouted. \u201cYour Honor!\u201d</p><p>The judge leveled his gaze on the defense. \u201cWas there a question in there or are you just testing me to see what it\u2019ll take to find you in contempt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that possible, Ms. Sheridan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw him, I knew him, I identified him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may step down, Ms. Sheridan.\u201d</p><p>She rose on shaky legs, grateful to be finished, to have finished strong. No way they could let him go now. No way a single jury member could doubt. Now that the door was open to Powell\u2019s motivation for raping her, they could look at his past, at his previous arrests.</p><p>She stepped down and started toward Mike. Then she collapsed.</p><p>When Brie had delivered her final statement Mike saw her face go pale, then white. As she left the stand and started to walk toward him, he noticed that her eyes had become glassy and she wasn\u2019t walking in a straight line. He started to come to his feet just as she fainted. \u201cBrie!\u201d he yelled. The bailiff stopped him until the prosecutor identified him as her husband\u2014though he was not.</p><p>Mike rushed to her. By the time he lifted her head, her eyes were opening. \u201cI did it, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get an ambulance here?\u201d Mike yelled.</p><p>\u201cOn the way, sir,\u201d someone said.</p><p>\u201cLo siento mucho,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to go through all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, it\u2019s okay, baby. You\u2019re done with it now. All of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTe amo, Miguel. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTe amo mucho,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s over, baby.\u201d</p><p>Every afternoon when it was almost David\u2019s nap time, Mel would drive out to the Andersen ranch. Doc went out there every morning and most evenings. They\u2019d been doing this since the second week in January when Lilly\u2019s chemo and radiation had been suspended. There comes a time in every life when the curtain is coming down, and when that time is present and there\u2019s no way to turn back the clock, the best answer is dignity and peace.</p><p>When Mel arrived at the ranch, she greeted family members and put David down in Chloe\u2019s crib with his afternoon bottle where he would sleep for a couple of hours. Then she went to Lilly\u2019s bedroom, checked the morphine drip and kissed her on the forehead. \u201cHow\u2019s my girl today?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think this is a good day to talk to the kids,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to miss my opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cWill you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Let\u2019s see who we can gather up.\u201d</p><p>Mel went to the living room and kitchen. Lilly\u2019s daughters were there, her sons out in the barn with their dad. \u201cYour mom wants to talk to you about something important. Can you round up your dad and brothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Sheila said.</p><p>Back in the bedroom, sitting down again beside Lilly and taking her hand, Mel said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I owe you so much, Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s the other way around. If I hadn\u2019t found Chloe on Doc\u2019s porch, I\u2019d have made it all the way to Colorado Springs without ever knowing my husband, without having my children.\u201d</p><p>Only five of Lilly\u2019s seven kids were present, but that was enough for her to make a clean breast of it. Buck stayed in the kitchen with Chloe, bouncing her on his knee as he had with the six children before her. \u201cThis is going to shock you,\u201d Lilly said to her grown children. \u201cI hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me. I lied to you. I was a little bit crazy,\u201d she said, and then was sent into a coughing fit and had to rest for a little while, her children looking at each other in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d Lilly said when she recovered. \u201cI have to get this over with. Chloe isn\u2019t adopted,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cI gave birth to her, right here, in this bed. I covered my pregnancy with large and loose clothes and put her on Doc\u2019s doorstep. Mel?\u201d she said, looking up at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see if I can help out with this,\u201d Mel said. \u201cYour mom is so tired. Lilly was distraught at the thought of having another child to raise at the age of forty-eight, already being a grandmother seven times. She thought some nice young couple desperate for a baby would want to adopt her and that everyone would be better off\u2014that Chloe would have young parents. But when no one came forward, Lilly took her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI regretted it so much,\u201d Lilly said. \u201cYour father thought it was crazy, but he was more afraid of what I might do if he didn\u2019t go along with the idea. I was really out of my mind. So I pretended to foster and adopt her\u2014but she\u2019s your blood. I can\u2019t die without you knowing.\u201d</p><p>Lilly\u2019s oldest daughter, Amy, sat down beside her on the bed. She took her mother\u2019s hand, kissed it gently and smiled. \u201cWell, that certainly explains why she looks like all the rest of the Andersens.\u201d She leaned over and kissed her mother\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t worry so much. It\u2019s okay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I lied to you all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did the right thing when you brought her back home. We would have taken care of her for life anyway....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important that you know where she came from,\u201d Mel said. \u201cNot just for medical reasons, but so she knows her legacy. Her biological family. We can\u2019t have our girl running around Northern California trying to figure out who her family is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you have to tell her someday, please tell her that I loved her so much. And that I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lilly said. \u201cShew. I\u2019m so tired. I hope this doesn\u2019t last much longer.\u201d</p><p>Mel stood and tinkered with the drip, giving her a little more morphine.</p><p>One by one Lilly\u2019s children leaned over the bed and kissed their mother.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mom. Everything is okay and I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for another sister, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of everything\u2014don\u2019t you ever worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s mad at you, Mom. You\u2019re the best mother and grandmother in the world.\u201d</p><p>And finally, to her oldest boy, Lilly said, \u201cHarry\u2014you be sure to take care of Dad. He\u2019s really helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it, Mom. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>When it was just Mel and Lilly again, Lilly said, \u201cThere. I\u2019ve been meaning to do that for a long time. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me. You raised a wonderful family. They\u2019re the most loving people I know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to go, knowing that. I\u2019m leaving behind some good work. Really, a woman couldn\u2019t ask for more from a lifetime than a family like that. They make me so proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman shouldn\u2019t go without knowing you\u2019ve made them proud, too.\u201d</p><p>Four days later Lilly Andersen closed her eyes on the world for the last time and was lovingly laid to rest in the family plot between the orchard and the meadow with most of the town present to say goodbye. Mel wasn\u2019t able to have Jack at her side and was sorry about that, but there was a great deal of peace and relief in knowing her friend was no longer in any pain.</p><p>Jack went back to Virgin River the moment he felt he could leave Brie, though Brie and Mike stayed on in Sacramento. Brie wanted to hear how the trial ended and to hear the verdict. But Jack was aching to get back to his family, and although he\u2019d talked to Mel several times a day, he hated that she\u2019d had to bury a good friend without him. And he was very secure that he left Brie in good hands. Mike was more than just attentive\u2014he was devoted.</p><p>As Jack drove into town he spotted Mel, all bundled up with David tucked inside her coat, just walking across the street to the bar. He pulled up to the bar and met her in front, folding them both into his arms. \u201cGod, I missed you. I\u2019m going soft\u2014I can\u2019t stand to sleep alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone was in my bed all night.\u201d She jostled the baby and David turned his wet, goopy mouth toward his dad for a kiss, which he got.</p><p>\u201cBllkk,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWhen do you think he\u2019s going to stop leaking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was everyone when you left them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cResting. Brie\u2019s doing pretty well. It\u2019ll take a while for her to get back on her feet\u2014that trial was more traumatic for her than she expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone is waiting for news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Doc in the bar yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I can tell it just once. Here\u2019s something for you\u2014guess who was there? At the trial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad. Sitting in the back. When Brie got off the stand and fainted and Mike rushed to her, Brad just kind of hung his head and left the courtroom. He screwed himself pretty good. And he knows it.\u201d He slipped a hand down under his son\u2019s bum to place over Mel\u2019s belly. \u201cHow\u2019s this one doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I seem to have passed the dark pukey days of the first trimester and am sailing through the comfort zone of the middle trimester, flying like a bullet toward my hugeness. We have to go get an ultrasound, see what you made me this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping for a girl,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an idea you might cut me off at two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wild about throwing up or waddling, but I sure love carrying around a little piece of you. You\u2019re right\u2014you make excellent babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have our special talents,\u201d he said.</p><p>Brie and Mike were another two weeks in Sacramento, awaiting the end of the trial. As she waited, Brie was once again haunted by the violence done to her. Sometimes the musty smell of that June night could come back to her; sometimes it was the smell of his sweat. His eyes would bore into her in her sleep. The pressure of his hand around her throat invaded her dreams and she would awake gasping, wondering if this was the end. It caused her to be weak and sick.</p><p>Mike never left her side. When she couldn\u2019t keep food down, his arms were around her as she lost it in the bathroom. At night he held her protectively, securely, gently. When a fright woke her with a gasp or near scream, he was right there to softly bring her back to reality in the safety of his arms. If he felt her shiver in a cold night sweat, he tenderly woke her and talked to her until she felt all right again. In just a few days Brie grew stronger, calmer and closer to closing the book on that horrific experience.</p><p>For Mike, Brie\u2019s crisis gave him a stronger sense of purpose; he had a problem in Virgin River that had to be resolved. He hated the thought of any woman going through this kind of trauma, and if there was a guy back in his small town who was preying on innocent young girls, he was going to find him and bring him to justice, if it took every breath he drew. Ironically, after all these years of police work, he was revisiting the emotions that had motivated him to get into law enforcement in the first place\u2014a force that drove him to keep the good people safe from the bad. To serve and protect.</p><p>When Brie and Mike returned to Virgin River they brought with them a guilty verdict and matching wedding bands. They were now ready to move ahead with their lives.</p><p>Jack was helping Paul put the finishing touches on the house while Brie was helping Mel order furniture and accessories. In addition, Mel was going to the Andersen ranch often, making sure the family there was doing all right. Most days she left David with Brie when she had calls to make. She was also checking Vanessa every week as her time grew near.</p><p>With his sister ready to deliver any minute and Jack\u2019s house nearly finished, Tom had to hang close to home, so he was able to find the time to take his girl on after-school rides around the property, along the river, into the woods. The weather was cold but clear, the ground crispy underneath the horses\u2019 hooves. He loved riding with her, talking with her, kissing afterward.</p><p>\u201cThat whole business with Brie being raped\u2014did you know about that? I mean before the trial and everything?\u201d Brenda asked Tommy as they were taking the horses in.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Paul told me all about it. Not long after Matt died. It happened last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that make you feel strange about her now? Knowing that happened to her, that someone did all that to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenda, it\u2019s not like she did anything wrong. In fact, she risked everything to get that guy, make sure he was behind bars so he couldn\u2019t ever do anything like that again. You have any idea how brave she had to be to do that? Mike\u2019s so proud of her, he idolizes her. I think Brie might be one of the strongest women I\u2019ve ever known. Brie and Mel and my sister, for sure.\u201d</p><p>Brenda dismounted when they got to the barn. \u201cWouldn\u2019t a guy feel funny about his girl getting raped? Like maybe not wanting to... You know... Seems like a guy wouldn\u2019t want to touch her after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike she was dirty? Come on,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cDon\u2019t think like that. When something bad happens to the girl you love, you just love her that much harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must\u2019ve been pretty scared. About the trial and everything. I wonder if she ever thought about just not doing it\u2014not testifying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took a lot for her to go through with that, but she did it.\u201d Tom took the reins of Brenda\u2019s mount and led the horses inside. He got the saddles off, the bridles released. When she followed him into the tack room, he turned and pulled her into his arms. This was his favorite part. He kissed her. Damn, he loved the girl. \u201cWanna find a nice, soft bale of hay?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>But she was crying. Little soft tears that made no noise.</p><p>\u201cBrenda? What\u2019s up, baby? Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to tell you something you\u2019re gonna hate.\u201d</p><p>He wiped the tears off her cheeks. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a virgin,\u201d she said with a sniff.</p><p>\u201cAw, Brenda.\u201d He laughed, closing his arms around her more tightly. \u201cWhat are you worrying about? That\u2019s not as big a deal to me as you might think.\u201d He pulled away and looked into her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re funny\u2014here you\u2019re embarrassed because you\u2019re not a virgin and I\u2019m embarrassed because I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t someone I dated,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I was raped.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cPretty sure?\u201d he asked.</p><p>But now that it was out and she couldn\u2019t turn back, Brenda crumbled against him, sobbing. Tom was no expert on girls, but he was smart enough to know he wasn\u2019t going to get the rest of the story until she calmed down a little. He sat down on the bench in the tack room and pulled her onto his lap, holding her while she cried. He murmured little words of comfort, stroked her back, held her close. It was quite a while before she could talk again.</p><p>\u201cI lied to you, Tommy,\u201d she said, wiping at her face with the back of her hand. \u201cI did go to one of those rest-stop parties. One. With a couple of girlfriends and a date\u2014a guy I went out with that one time. You take sleeping bags, you know? Because you\u2019ll have to sleep over, either in cars or on the ground, on account of drinking. Like camping, right? I got drunk real fast and passed out. When I woke up, I\u2019d been sick all over the place and a couple of the guys said I\u2019d really gotten wasted and was pretty hilarious\u2014but I don\u2019t remember anything. Two months later I realized I was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, letting out a short, embarrassed laugh. \u201cI was on my way to get an abortion when I had a miscarriage. Whoever it was gave me a raging infection. I hope he dies of it. There\u2014it\u2019s out. Now you can break up with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that? I told you, I love you.\u201d He stroked her hair. \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to know. There were six guys at that party\u2014I gave the names to Mike. He\u2019d like me to tell the story to the sheriff\u2014but what good\u2019s that going to do? I\u2019m not like Brie, Tommy\u2014I have no idea who it was. Plus, I\u2019m not brave enough to do that. And I don\u2019t want the whole school to know I got pregnant. And really, I don\u2019t even want to know who it was because, God, what if there was more than one? Oh, God,\u201d she said, falling into helpless tears again.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Brenda, honey. It\u2019s okay...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can you think of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014it\u2019s not your fault and I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go any further with it. All I wanted since I realized what happened is that it go away. No way I\u2019m going to blame anyone, testify against anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they could get the guy without putting you through all that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd what if I wasn\u2019t raped, really? What if I was just stupid drunk and let some guy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together over five months. You\u2019re not like that. We\u2019ve had a beer or two together\u2014you\u2019re not like that. That isn\u2019t what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere might\u2019ve been a drug,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He pulled her close against him. It was hard, but he tried to focus on Brenda\u2019s feelings rather than building rage at what had been done to his girl, even before she was his girl. Of course he remembered the fight he\u2019d been in with Whitley. It turned his stomach to think that little prick could\u2019ve slipped his girl a drug and then used her. But he couldn\u2019t let himself think about that yet. He had to keep his arms around her, convince her he would never hold that against her. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cThere might\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver since that happened, I feel like trash. When you first started talking to me in school? When I told you I\u2019d been sick? I hadn\u2019t been sick. I\u2019d been knocked up while I was passed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not trash,\u201d he whispered softly, not trusting his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re an angel. Pure as gold. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it feels. Tommy,\u201d she said miserably, \u201cI dated before and I wouldn\u2019t give it up\u2014I was saving it for someone really special. Someone like you\u2014someone I really loved. And now I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else can ever take that away, Brenda. When... If... If it\u2019s us and we know it\u2019s time and it\u2019s right, it\u2019ll be special. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can it be? The first time should be so special. Now it won\u2019t even be the first time!\u201d</p><p>He brushed her hair away from her eyes. \u201cWhat can I do to show you that I love you just the same? Respect you? Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Come on, we\u2019re going to take care of these horses. Then we\u2019re going to find a nice soft bale of hay and I\u2019m going to hold you. Hold you and kiss you until you believe me when I say I think you\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. Everything is going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so scared to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Bren. It\u2019s okay now. I don\u2019t want you to ever worry about that again. Okay?\u201d</p> <p>An hour later, lying on the fresh hay in the stall, Tommy held his girl, kissed her, touched her gently in the places she\u2019d begun to allow and told her how much he cared about her. He was careful not to try anything more or do anything less, and after a while she curved against him in their familiar way, trusting him. In case she wondered if she still turned him on, it took absolutely no effort on his part to demonstrate that he was just as easily aroused by her as ever before. Then when he took her home, he kissed her on the front porch and told her as far as he was concerned, she was perfect. Pure and perfect.</p><p>He might\u2019ve been a little quiet at dinner, but around his house the past couple of months, that went completely unnoticed. A little later he told his dad he was going to run into town and would be back in an hour or so. Walt probably assumed he was going to see Brenda.</p><p>He parked his truck around behind the bar, just in case the Carpenters happened to be having an evening drink, something they did with their friends the Bristols from time to time. He walked back to Mike\u2019s RV and knocked on the door. Mike opened it. \u201cCan I talk to you a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Wanna come inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about out here?\u201d Tom said.</p><p>Mike grabbed his coat and stepped outside.</p><p>\u201cRemember those parties you were asking about?\u201d Tom asked, standing beside Mike but looking straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mike said.</p> <p>\u201cYou think there might\u2019ve been a drug that made people pass out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery possible,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe things happened to people while they were passed out? Against their will?\u201d he asked, still looking straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cCould be.\u201d</p><p>Tom turned to look at Mike. \u201cI bet I know who has some. I bet I can get him to sell me some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how would you know this?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>Tom shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just an investigative genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do this? A buy? There\u2019d have to be police, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Tom said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll check and see if I can get some other stuff. If I\u2019m going to do this, might as well get it done right. Might be meth or ecstasy or something. That interest you at all?\u201d Tom asked.</p><p>\u201cPal, what interests me is getting anything that could hurt people off the street. If you think you can help me do that, I\u2019d sure appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis what you\u2019ve been looking for, asking all your questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s do it,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Vanessa had asked Paul if he could stay until the baby came and he said he could if she wanted him to. By his calculations, the house would be finished at about the same time Vanni gave birth. Jack and Mel would still have one or two things to do\u2014carpet, appliances, paint\u2014but the general contractor wouldn\u2019t be needed for that. And the house was shaping up very well\u2014the hardwood floors sanded and varnished, master bath complete, plumbing and light fixtures in, walls textured for painting, porch painted and sealed. Furniture deliveries were scheduled. Mel was spending evenings packing dishes and things at the cabin.</p><p>And Vanni was getting huge.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t crying so much these days. It seemed as though a lot of her attention was focused on preparing to go into labor. Oh, there were times she\u2019d get a little weepy, which was certainly to be expected. But she was so strong\u2014Paul just admired the hell out of her.</p><p>When he came home from the job site one day, she met him in the foyer. \u201cCome with me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should wash up first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just come.\u201d She took his hand and led him into the great room. She sat in one of the overstuffed leather chairs and directed Paul to another. This was the most animated Paul had seen her in a long time. Her cheeks were bright; her eyes sparkled. \u201cPaul, the baby is coming very soon.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s getting real obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my very best friend, Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Vanni,\u201d he said, but he furrowed his eyebrows. Suspicious.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be with me during the delivery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you how?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be the one to encourage me, coach me, coax me. Hold my hand. Support me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm... Isn\u2019t that Mel\u2019s job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel is going to be very much a coach, but she\u2019s also going to be the midwife and she\u2019ll be busy with other things. Especially when the baby is coming out. I need you to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni,\u201d he said, scooting forward on his chair, \u201cI\u2019m a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Guys do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...Vanni, I shouldn\u2019t.... Vanessa, listen. I can\u2019t see you like that. It wouldn\u2019t be...appropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, actually, I thought about my brother or my dad and frankly, that really doesn\u2019t appeal to me. So,\u201d she said, lifting a video from the table beside her, \u201cI got us a childbirth movie from Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, no,\u201d he said, pleading.</p><p>She stood up and popped it into the VCR, then sat down again with the remote in her hand. \u201cJack delivered his own son,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know, but in case you\u2019re interested, he wasn\u2019t thrilled about it at the time. And he refuses to do it again\u2014he\u2019s adamant about that. And, Vanni, this isn\u2019t my son. This is my best friend\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know that, Paul. But since it is your best friend\u2019s son, he\u2019d be so grateful.\u201d She started the video. \u201cNow, I want you to concentrate on what the partner is doing. Don\u2019t worry about the mother. Most of the time while I\u2019m in labor you\u2019ll either be behind me, or helping me walk or squat to use gravity to help with the dilating, or reminding me to breathe properly. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to have your face in the field of birth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to feel kind of weak,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Brie or Paige, if you need someone for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do that, but to tell you the truth, I\u2019m much closer to you. And you\u2019re here\u2014right here. You can do this. We\u2019ll watch the movie together and if you have any questions, just ask me.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the screen, his brows drawn together. He squinted. This was an unattractive woman, giving birth. Well, not just yet\u2014she was working up to it. Her big belly was sticking out, which was not what made her plain. It was the stringy hair, monobrow, baggy socks on her feet and\u2014\u201cVanni, she has very hairy legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what worries you I can still manage to shave my legs, even though I have to admit I\u2019ve lost interest.\u201d</p><p>The hospital gown on the woman was draped over her belly and legs in such a way that when she started to rise into a sitting position, spreading her thighs and grabbing them to bear down, she was covered. Then the doctor or midwife or whoever was in charge flipped that gown out of the way and there, right in Paul\u2019s face, was the top of a baby\u2019s head emerging from the woman\u2019s body. \u201cAw, man,\u201d he whined, putting his head in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI said watch the coach\u2014don\u2019t worry about the woman,\u201d Vanni lectured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty damn hard to not look at that, Vanni,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cConcentrate.\u201d</p><p>So he looked up and saw that behind the woman, supporting her, was a man\u2014presumably her husband\u2014holding her shoulders and smiling and telling her to push. But Paul\u2019s gaze dropped, because how could he help it? And there, again, was the baby\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cThis is cruel and unusual,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou go to war and shoot animals in the woods\u2014surely you can do this,\u201d she said, getting very bossy as she did so. \u201cBig animals\u2014you shoot big animals. This is a lot nicer than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends entirely on what you\u2019re used to,\u201d he grumbled. He watched as the man on the screen told the woman to pant, pant, pant and then push, push, push. Well, how hard was that? And the woman was sweating as if she had just run a marathon. She grabbed her own thighs again, pulled herself up, bore down with a grunt and a snarl as if bench-pressing 350, and holy shit! The head popped right out of her! \u201cAw, man,\u201d he whined again, ducking and swinging his head, bringing himself right to a standing position, turning his back on the TV. \u201cVanessa, where is your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent Dad and Tommy to the stable so we could watch this movie together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa, I cannot do this. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve been expecting to do this for a long time. Or if you were like some stranger, a woman suddenly having a baby in my taxicab or something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Paul,\u201d she said, pointing. He glanced back at the screen over his shoulder and saw the whole baby come sliding out, all gross and mucky, right into the doctor\u2019s hands. And the cord, still attached, was threaded up inside the woman.</p><p>Paul sat down and put his head between his knees, because it would be so embarrassing to faint and have her revive him. \u201cVanessa,\u201d he said miserably, \u201cyou are making the biggest mistake of your life here.\u201d</p><p>Her hand was on his knee. \u201cWe can watch it several times until you get used to it. Desensitized, as it were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, God, no...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if that\u2019s what it takes...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lifted his head in time to see the cord had been cut, and the baby was placed on the mother\u2019s stomach when this horrible-looking thing he knew to be a placenta came bubbling out. He thought, I\u2019m gonna die. Right here, right now.</p><p>Vanessa made a terrible sound and he thought, see! She can\u2019t take it, either! But when he looked at her, he realized that wasn\u2019t the problem. With one hand on her big belly and a grimace on her face, she looked as if they were headed far too rapidly for real life.</p><p>\u201cOh-oh,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cShew. It\u2019s okay\u2014we have plenty of time. We can watch the movie again and again, if you need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cI am never watching that movie again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re good to go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say so, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, clearly ignoring him. \u201cI think you should go take a shower. Clean up. I\u2019ve been in labor all day, but the contractions are getting serious now and I\u2019m going to call Mel to touch base.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna do it, Paul. I know you won\u2019t let me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet I will,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I manage to stay upright through something like that, it\u2019ll be a miracle. I\u2019m talking miracle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Matt can\u2019t be here with me, I need you to be here with me. Please?\u201d</p><p>Oh, goddamn it, he thought. She\u2019s playing the Matt card.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVanni, I\u2019d do anything for you, honey. But this is a mistake. A mistake.\u201d</p><p>And she said, \u201cOhhhhh,\u201d while she held her belly. He stared at her with wide, horrified eyes while she tried to get through the contraction.</p><p>So that\u2019s what he\u2019d seen on her face when he walked in the door. She was now having her baby and everything else was on the back burner. She was focused, like a mother wolf protecting her pup\u2014not a grieving widow, but a mother. And she meant business. It amazed him how something like that kicked in. When the contraction passed she looked at him with clear but fierce aquamarine eyes and said, \u201cShower.\u201d Then she stood, holding her belly underneath, and went to the phone.</p><p>Paul went to his room, gathered clean clothes and headed down the hall to the shower. He made it quick, but clean. He shaved. Then he thought, I am shaving\u2014why? To be smooth cheeked when I pass out? By the time he was coming out with his dirty clothes to take back to his room, he heard voices. Male voices down the hall and female voices in Vanni\u2019s room. And laughter\u2014as if there was anything to laugh about!</p><p>He headed down the hall where there were men, where there would be someone sympathetic who could get him out of this. There he found Jack with David on his hip, Walt and Tommy. \u201cHey, there,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHow you doing?\u201d</p><p>Paul got right up close to Jack. \u201cListen, Jack, you have no idea what she wants me to do,\u201d he said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. She told everyone. Mel will be right out to get you as soon as Vanni\u2019s settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be better at this than me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I probably would.\u201d Jack grinned. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Jack clamped a hand on his back. \u201cSure you can. You\u2019ll be fine. Count your lucky stars\u2014at least you have a midwife in there with you.\u201d Jack smiled. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a good experience for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re wrong about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul!\u201d Mel called. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Jesus.\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned toward him. \u201cMan-up, pal. Or they\u2019ll never let you hear the end of it.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Paul went down the hall. Mel, grinning very happily, met him outside Vanni\u2019s bedroom door. \u201cHow we doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot so good, Mel. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not up to this. I\u2019m very inexperienced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Paul, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s going to be a while before the baby comes, and right now all Vanni really needs is someone to rub her back, help her remember to breathe through the contractions, maybe give her a damp cloth for her forehead, or the back of the neck really helps sometimes. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. If you can\u2019t go the distance, that\u2019s okay. Just get us that far, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can,\u201d he said. When he got into the room he was very relieved to see Vanni, clothed in a gown that didn\u2019t reveal anything, sitting up in the bed, cross-legged, smiling. So he smiled back. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine at the moment, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, you should have told me this was what you wanted a long time ago. I\u2019m totally unprepared to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Paul. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. I probably won\u2019t be\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped talking as he noticed he didn\u2019t have her attention anymore. She was looking off into the distance, running her hands in circles over her belly, breathing in with slow exhales. And after just a moment of that, her face contorted and the breathing came faster, harder. Then there was some groaning as the pain seized her. As the crescendo was reached, it began to subside, back to the slow exhales and circular hand movements, then eventually it went away and she looked back up at him and smiled.</p><p>Mel came back into the room carrying towels. \u201cHow\u2019s the back?\u201d</p><p>She put a hand to her lower back and said, \u201cLots of pressure there, but it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Paul said. \u201cTry to lean forward a little.\u201d He pressed his fingertips against the small of her back. \u201cDoes that help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s good. Very good.\u201d He moved his hands around the small of her back, then up to her shoulders, massaging them. \u201cOh, that\u2019s lovely,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Mel stayed busy in the room, laying things out\u2014instruments, blankets, gloves, basin. While Vanni went into and through another contraction, Mel simply organized her supplies, leaving Vanni\u2019s contraction to Paul. When Vanni couldn\u2019t lean forward during the contraction, when it pushed her back against the pillows, Paul just concentrated on massaging her shoulders and upper arms and neck. He found himself saying, \u201cRelax and breathe, Vanni\u2014in and out slowly. Good, good. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d she said. \u201cUh, uh, uh! Ohhhhh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you give her something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Paul. She\u2019s doing great.\u201d Mel looked at her watch. \u201cThey\u2019re coming closer.\u201d When the contraction passed she said, \u201cLet\u2019s get you up, Vanni. Stand up for me\u2014get a little help from gravity. Paul, let\u2019s get her up.\u201d</p><p>Vanni swung her legs over the side and with Paul\u2019s assistance she stood up. When the next contraction came, she had to sit on the edge of the bed, which made it a little easier for Paul to rub her back. Mel slipped out of the room, pulling the door closed behind her. As the contraction passed, Paul urged her to stand again and they did that for a little while, up and down, up and down. And then, just as Mel entered the room again, Vanni let go with a great groan and her water broke, running in a huge gush to the floor. It splashed on Paul\u2019s shoes and soaked the carpet.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a good sign. Here, let me spread out a couple of towels and I\u2019ll check you, see how we\u2019re doing. By the way, a birthing party has begun out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Vanni said. Then she groaned and bent over, panting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it was completely unplanned, but when Jack leaked it that you were in labor, Preacher and Paige came out\u2014Christopher is watching a video, but he\u2019s falling asleep on the couch. Mike and Brie are here, whipping up some snacks in the kitchen, keeping your dad and Tommy company. Jack\u2019s giving David his evening bottle, and...\u201d She stopped talking as she helped Vanni back onto the bed. Vanni\u2019s knees came up, Mel pulled the gloves on and with one hand on her belly and the other disappearing between her legs, Mel said, \u201cWell, now. Vanessa, you ought to do this for a living. You\u2019re making great progress. Stay like that if you can\u2014on your next contraction, I want to see if I can spread you a little bit.\u201d She looked up over her belly. \u201cGrab Paul\u2019s hand and breathe\u2014it isn\u2019t going to feel good, but it might give us faster results.\u201d</p><p>Paul got down on one knee at the side of the bed and held her hand, looking into her eyes. \u201cYou doing okay?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working very hard,\u201d she said, breathless.</p><p>\u201cI know. God, Vanni\u2014I wish there was more I could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing so much, Paul. Oh! Here we go! Ughhhh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d Mel said. \u201cVery good. Very good.\u201d One gloved hand rested on her belly, the other disappeared again between her legs. \u201cPant,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>Vanni panted, but then inevitably she whimpered from the pain and Paul instinctively put his lips against her forehead and held on.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Vanessa,\u201d Mel said, pulling out her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re almost ready to start pushing.\u201d She snapped off her gloves.</p><p>Paul noticed that when Mel withdrew her hand, there was blood on the glove. \u201cIs that all right?\u201d he asked. He gave a nod toward the glove.</p><p>\u201cPerfectly normal,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing a little more of that. You hanging in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. And then he thought, I\u2019ve been tricked pretty good. Like I could leave her now. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to get a damp cloth, Vanni. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>He went across the hall to the bathroom and first splashed cold water on his own face, then wet and squeezed out a face-cloth and hurried back to her. It was a done deal\u2014he was in now. He glanced at his watch and was amazed to see that three hours had passed since he\u2019d come off the job site. He heard the sound of the TV droning down the hall and laughter from the kitchen. Soft, polite laughter.</p><p>When he got back he noticed that Vanni was showing the effects of hard labor\u2014her skin was glistening with sweat, her hair was damp and limp, her face looked twisted with the pain. He knelt again; Mel had spread some towels on the damp carpet, but the knees of his trousers were already wet. He didn\u2019t care. He mopped her brow and held her hand through a few more contractions and then Mel gave the signal.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Vanni\u2014we\u2019re going to do it. If you feel the urge, push on the next one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>\u201cPaul, I want you to support her from behind, help raise her up a bit. Vanni, you know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Paul started to lift her and Vanessa said, \u201cNot yet.\u201d Then in a moment she was lifted off the bed in a horrendous urge to bear down and, remarkably, he didn\u2019t have to be told it was time. He braced her from behind while she gave a huge grunt and strained, holding her breath, pushing for all she was worth. When she collapsed against the bed he asked, \u201cIs he out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. It\u2019s going to take a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut on that movie...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a first baby,\u201d Mel said. \u201cHe came out way too easily. First babies take time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever much they want.\u201d Mel put her fetoscope in her ears, flipped Vanni\u2019s gown up over her belly and listened. She pulled the gown back down and said, \u201cHe\u2019s a strong one. He\u2019s going to keep you up nights.\u201d</p><p>Paul did his job\u2014brow mopping, hand-holding, encouraging, supporting. It went on for almost an hour and he watched as Vanni got more and more tired and Mel stayed busy getting ready to catch that baby. While Paul supported Vanni he heard Mel say, \u201cHold it a little longer...right where you feel the pressure.... Okay, take a breath and push again.... Way to go!\u201d Mel spread out the baby towel on the bed, brought her clamps, suction, scissors to the bed. Finally she said, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hit pay dirt on this next one, Vanni. Make it a good one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMake it a good one, baby,\u201d Paul heard himself say. \u201cReady, push. Push. Push. Push.\u201d</p><p>Mel handed Paul a blanket. \u201cSpread this over Vanni\u2019s tummy, Paul. When the baby is delivered, that\u2019s where he\u2019s going. We\u2019re going to dry him off and then rewrap him in a clean, warm blanket. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, mesmerized.</p> <p>Vanni reared up again, pushing. Paul did his job, just as he\u2019d been instructed.</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d Mel said. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there! I think the next push is going to do it, Vanni. Here we go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay honey, here we go,\u201d Paul said. In spite of himself, he was leaning forward, watching, wanting to see this baby being born, wanting to be in on this all the way now. He heard the baby cry, heard Mel exclaim happily. He grabbed the blanket, did his job and out of the womb came this mucky, squalling infant. Oh, man, he looked unhappy. \u201cWhoa,\u201d Paul said with a laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s pissed!\u201d</p><p>Vanni laughed emotionally.</p><p>Paul stared in wonder at the new life, astonished by what she\u2019d done. Astonished that he\u2019d been there. Then he remembered\u2014he was supposed to do things. Together, he and Mel dried the baby, and while he was helping with that, he couldn\u2019t help counting fingers and toes. He watched Mel clamp and cut, then he wrapped the baby in a new, dry blanket and carefully lifted him. Vanni was struggling to pull herself up a little bit, trying to get the pillows behind her back. Paul held the baby in one arm, assisted her with the other. Then he knelt beside the bed and watched as Vanni snuggled the baby close, gently kissed his head. And, Paul, not completely conscious, rested his lips against Vanni\u2019s shoulder.</p> <p>She turned her head and looked into his eyes. Vanni reached up a hand to his face and wiped the tears from his cheeks. Tears he had absolutely no idea were there.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in business,\u201d Mel said. \u201cGood job. Good, good job.\u201d</p><p>Paul was exhausted. He lowered his head to Vanni\u2019s shoulder and just lay there for a moment, trying to imagine what she\u2019d just been through. He felt her fingers in his hair. \u201cOh, Vanni,\u201d he whispered. He lifted his head. \u201cWhat you did.\u201d</p><p>She started to smile, but then her face seemed to melt into a frown as the tears rose to her eyes and began to run down her cheeks. She looked up at Paul and whispered, \u201cI wish he could see his son.\u201d</p><p>Paul brushed at the tears on her cheeks. \u201cHe sees him, baby. He\u2019s got the best seat in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, the tears flowing. \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>Paul slipped his arm under her shoulders and held her to him while she softly cried, and he unconsciously dropped his own tears onto her hair.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get that baby on the breast, Vanessa. Redheads are such bleeders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, tremulously. \u201cYeah, got it.\u201d She was pulling at her gown, but it seemed a little stuck and her hands were shaking. Paul gave the gown a tug and up it came, exposing one breast, but he wasn\u2019t noticing it as if it was a breast. It was as if it was just another part of delivering the baby. He helped her position the baby, who was screaming madly. And then suddenly he stopped and started rooting. And bang\u2014he found it. \u201cOhhh,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Wow.\u201d Then she looked up at Paul and smiled. And the baby suckled, making precious little noises.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t noticed that Mel was gone until she returned with a basin of water and set it up on the changing table. She examined Vanni quickly, covered her up again and said, \u201cOkay, let me get this guy cleaned up for a viewing. How you doing, Vanni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, wiping at her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Paul kissed her forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Vanessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d she whispered, and closed her eyes.</p><p>He stayed on his knees beside her bed while Mel took the baby, and for the entire time she washed him, Paul watched Vanni\u2019s face as she slowly drifted into exhausted sleep. He gently kissed the tears from her cheeks. A few minutes later Mel touched his shoulder. She was holding a bundled baby and said, \u201cHere you go. Take him to his grandfather and uncle. I\u2019ll put this room and Mom right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said, handing him over. \u201cYou earned the right.\u201d</p><p>Walt and Tommy were most impressed with their new addition, as was the entire gathering. The camera came out and pictures were taken, the blanket pulled back to watch him kick his little legs, to exclaim on the size of his feet.</p><p>\u201cBet you could use a shot,\u201d Preacher said to Paul.</p><p>\u201cWhew, partner, you\u2019ll never know,\u201d he said, scrubbing a hand along the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat you got on your pants there, bud?\u201d</p><p>Paul looked down. \u201cI believe that\u2019s amniotic fluid. The carpet\u2019s going to have to be shampooed in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d Preacher tipped a bottle over a few glasses. \u201cI\u2019m going to do that, you know. I\u2019m going to be with Paige when the baby comes. I\u2019m dying to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you\u2019re more prepared than I was. It really took me by surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t regret it, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. It was awesome,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I hear,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cThese guys, they don\u2019t want to do it, but then afterward they think it was their idea. Zeke, you know\u2014he\u2019s done it four times. He says he\u2019d do it four more, but I think his wife is going to shoot him before that can happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeke is a paramedic,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThat might give him an edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Preacher said, sipping. \u201cAlso a sex maniac, I guess. A sex maniac who loves kids.\u201d</p><p>Jack joined them. \u201cSo\u2014you made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, you are my hero. It was such a challenge to just be there, I don\u2019t know how you delivered David. Honest to God, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had directions,\u201d he said, lifting his glass. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it again, however. I\u2019m going to keep a really close eye on her next time. I want to watch, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>It was a celebration, albeit quiet and controlled so as not to get the baby wailing or wake Vanessa, who had earned a little rest. Christopher was out like a light on the couch, and David was asleep on Walt\u2019s bed with pillows stacked around him. Pretty soon Mel emerged and she was congratulated on a job well done. Everyone had their turn to hold the baby and then finally he was taken back to his room, his mother\u2019s room.</p><p>They all gathered in the dining room with their celebratory drinks, remnants of snacks still on the table. Paul stood in the doorway to the kitchen. Brie sat on Mike\u2019s lap, Paige leaned up against Preacher, his big arm around her shoulders. Jack stood behind Mel, massaging her shoulders. Walt had given Tom a beer, which he appeared to be handling like a pro.</p><p>\u201cSo when are the Valenzuelas stepping up to the plate?\u201d Walt asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working on it,\u201d Mike said with a grin. Then he kissed Brie\u2019s cheek. \u201cAren\u2019t we, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike is working very hard.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, you wanna look out for that,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cAsk Mel. Crazy as it seems, having sex every day isn\u2019t a good way to get pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d Paige scolded.</p><p>Before she could get her scold out, at least three people echoed, \u201cEvery day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Jesus, it\u2019s not against the law, is it?\u201d Preacher asked, making everyone laugh the harder.</p><p>\u201cPreacher, you are my hero, man,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cI wanna be just like you when I grow up!\u201d</p><p>Walt ruffled his hair. \u201cMy son is a damn liar. He wants to be just like you yesterday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Tom said. \u201cI\u2019m not all that keen on babies, but the rest of it sounds pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before people started to make noises about leaving, looking around for Paul. It seemed he had slipped away. Jack went down the hall and peeked into Vanessa\u2019s room, to find her sleeping peacefully.</p><p>Jack told the birthing party to sit tight while he looked to see if Paul had stepped outside for air. He put on his jacket and walked out around the house and down past the stable and corral. He didn\u2019t have to be psychic to figure this out. It had been a long and emotional day for Paul. He was standing up on that little hill not far from the house. The one from which you could see a whole lot of the general\u2019s land.</p><p>Paul glanced over his shoulder as he heard the frozen ground crunching beneath Jack\u2019s boots. Then he looked back at the gorgeous headstone. It read \u201cMatt Rutledge, beloved husband, father, son, brother, friend.\u201d Jack put his hand on Paul\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019d be glad you were there, standing in for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just telling him about it and I thought, shit, I don\u2019t even know how much of him is in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHe\u2019s moved on.\u201d</p><p>Paul hit his chest with a fist. \u201cI still have him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Everyone who loved him has him there. I think that\u2019s the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been the one tonight. It should\u2019ve been him. She misses him so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, we all have different paths, Paul. His led him there, yours led you here.\u201d</p><p>Paul sniffed and wiped at his face. \u201cThe house is about done,\u201d he said. \u201cVanni will be up and around in no time and I can\u2019t hang around here anymore. I have to get back. To Grants Pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBut you\u2019ll be back pretty soon. You have strong ties here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive her time, Paul. It\u2019s still a little raw, but that\u2019s going to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he asked, looking at him in the dark.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus, I wondered. You don\u2019t remember. You got a little drunk and\u2014 No, you got a lot drunk and kind of let it slip about how you saw her first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it easy. Just to me. You had the discretion to pass out before you told anyone else. So listen to me for once, okay? Because this is important. You already know this, but right now you think you\u2019re the only man who\u2019s ever been in this position. I married a widow. Remember? It wasn\u2019t easy. It wasn\u2019t quick\u2014getting over that long, ugly hump of wondering where I fit in. It was goddamn humbling, if you want the truth. But, Paul, it was worth every sleepless night I invested. It\u2019s just that it takes whatever time it takes.\u201d</p><p>Paul thought a minute. He fixed his lips tight, as if he were struggling. \u201cI have to get back to Grants Pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you come back here before long,\u201d Jack said. \u201cCome back regular. I\u2019m telling you, if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t stay much longer, Jack. It\u2019s eating me up. I gotta get out of here. He was my best friend, and he\u2019s dead, and I helped his baby into the world, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want his woman. I know this is a rough patch, Paul, but if you\u2019re the kind of guy who cuts and runs, oh man, you\u2019re going to hate yourself.\u201d Paul hung his head. \u201cCome on,\u201d Jack said. \u201cPeople want to say good-night. They want to pat you on the back one more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just leave me out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said, turning Paul away from the grave with a hand behind his neck. \u201cThe general wants to tell you\u2014Matt picked a name. They\u2019ve made a few adjustments on account of his death\u2014adjustments that were Vanessa\u2019s idea. Matt wanted to name him Paul. But they\u2019ve settled on Matthew Paul. I think you should drink to it. And think to it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sixteen</p><p>Tom was quiet while he brushed down the horses with Brenda, but it didn\u2019t matter because she was talking a mile a minute. He\u2019d invited her out to see the new baby, just a week old, and she was all jazzed about that. Then they took a quick ride and he listened to her go on and on about the cheerleading tryouts for her senior year that were coming up. He had already agreed to take her to the prom, though it was only February, and she had a million things to say about that. When the horses were put away, he grabbed her hand and led her into the tack room. He sat on the bench, pulled her onto his lap and kissed her deeply, lovingly. And he said, \u201cI have to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you. I know you believe that. And I want you like mad, which you can\u2019t help but believe. But I\u2019m going to do something\u2014even though it might cost me everything. You and whatever I have with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to the police,\u201d he said.</p><p>She jumped right off his lap. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked in disbelief, shaking her head to try to make it go away. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He tried to pull her back onto his lap, but she skittered out of his reach, the look on her face one of sheer horror. So he stood up and faced her. \u201cNot just Mike. Other police. A special detective unit, as it turns out. I\u2019m going to help them get the guy who gave you the drug\u2014because there was a guy and there was a drug.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said again, shaking her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t know that any more than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we both know. It might even come back on you, but I\u2019m not sure how. You might be asked what you know about it, and you\u2019ll say whatever you want. Maybe you won\u2019t say anything. But I had to, Brenda.\u201d</p><p>Tears immediately ran down her cheeks and she stepped back another step. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t have to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did, and I\u2019ll tell you why. Because I want to sleep at night. Because I don\u2019t want to try to imagine that sometime this summer or next year some poor slob like me is holding the girl he loves while she cries her heart out over being raped. I don\u2019t want to think of some poor girl\u2014a good girl who\u2019s saving herself\u2014waking up pregnant when she probably wouldn\u2019t have even scored a hangover! I\u2019m not going to lie awake at night and wonder if there are a couple of kids like me and you, in love and playing it so carefully, so straight, getting ripped up by this asshole. I\u2019m going to try to stop him even if you never speak to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I told you, I don\u2019t know what happened! There\u2019s nothing I can do! And even if I could, I don\u2019t want to! God, Tommy, I don\u2019t want anyone to know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you. I didn\u2019t tell the police about you, but that\u2019s going to be irrelevant. Eventually they\u2019re going to want to hear from every kid who went to every one of those keggers and parties, to know what happened to them. And I\u2019m sorry for that\u2014you\u2019ll handle it however you want to. But I\u2019m not letting this guy do it to anyone else\u2019s girl. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re mad, but I\u2019m not sorry I did it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, hanging his head. He lifted his head. \u201cWell, I love you, and I\u2019m sorry this upsets you. I hope someday, like in about a million years, you\u2019ll think back about this and even if you still hate me, maybe you\u2019ll have some respect for me doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>She started to sob, shaking her head until her pretty, silky light brown hair fell over her face. \u201cWhy did you do this? Why? Now it\u2019s going to get out. I shouldn\u2019t have told you\u2014I thought I could trust you! Now everyone will think I\u2019m just a slut!\u201d He reached for her and she pulled back. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me! Don\u2019t you ever touch me!\u201d</p><p>But he pulled her against him anyway and held her while she cried. And oh, man, she cried so hard he thought she was going to throw up. She started to gag, in fact, but he hung on until she exhausted herself. And he still hung on. \u201cWhy?\u201d she kept saying to him. \u201cWhy? It wasn\u2019t for you to do\u2014it was for me to do if I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? And if it happens to someone else because you didn\u2019t say anything? And if someone dies?\u201d he asked, but he asked gently even as he held her. \u201cI don\u2019t care that you aren\u2019t saying anything about it. That\u2019s your choice. You know what\u2014you go ahead and hate me. You blame me if you want to, when we both know the real bad guy isn\u2019t me. Thing is, I have to live with myself.\u201d</p><p>She pulled out of his arms. \u201cWell, I just hope you can.\u201d</p> <p>He stared at her for a long moment. \u201cI can,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>The next day after school Tom drove his little red truck over to Jordan Whitley\u2019s house. He ran up on the porch and knocked on the door. Jordan answered and Tom said, \u201cHey. Got my stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, man,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna love it.\u201d He reached into his pocket and pulled out a little baggie and an envelope. When Tom reached for it he said, \u201cHey, forget something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. How much did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a hundy, man. You\u2019re gonna be so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat we have here?\u201d Tom asked.</p><p>\u201cRoofies, ecstasy, meth. Made to order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind about the meth,\u201d he said, and Jordan took back the little baggie. \u201cSo, I get a discount right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, pal. They don\u2019t exactly give refunds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Tom said. \u201cYou use this stuff a lot?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe roofies?\u201d</p><p>Jordan shrugged. \u201cCoupla times. Just for kicks, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cJust for kicks.\u201d He handed him a wad of bills, accepted the drugs and stepped out of the way.</p><p>A detective came around from each side of the house, plainclothes, badges out and aimed at Jordan. One was a young woman in a ball cap with a ponytail strung through the back\u2014she looked not much older than Tom. She could have passed for a college girl, young looking and petite. The other undercover cop was a great big guy in jeans and a jacket. Both had guns, cuffs and tasers on their belts. \u201cPolice!\u201d the girl said. \u201cJordan Whitley, you\u2019re under arrest. We have a search warrant. Turn around, hands up against the house.\u201d</p><p>The look on his face was priceless. It almost made Tom smile. Pure, horrified shock. \u201cHey!\u201d he yelled. \u201cHey, what\u2019s up with this!\u201d But before he could even finish his sentence this little bitty girl had him whirled around, his legs kicked apart and was patting him down while the big guy stood over him, daring him to move.</p><p>While they cuffed him, he looked over his shoulder at Tom. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be so sorry, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, probably,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never regret it.\u201d Then he handed the envelope to the big detective and walked down the porch steps to his truck just as a patrol car pulled up and a uniformed officer got out. Down the street was a dark SUV with tinted windows, an unmarked police vehicle. Inside, watching the arrest, would be Detective Delaney and Mike. Tom went home to tell his family what he\u2019d done.</p><p>Paul\u2019s fifth wheel was hooked up to the back of his truck, and his bags were packed and sitting out on the front walk of the general\u2019s house. Before going outside to leave, he put his arms around Vanessa and drew her against him, baby and all, and kissed her cheek. \u201cPlease come back very soon,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI could never have gotten through this without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have gotten through it without you, too,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay now, Vanni. If you need me, you just call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you more than you realize. You\u2019ve been like one of the family,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, and he thought, that\u2019s why I have to go now. Because I can\u2019t be like that to her anymore. Like a brother. It\u2019s killing me. \u201cThank you for making me feel so welcome, so much a part of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was natural, Paul. It felt right, having you here. Now that the house is done, I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be around too much, and that\u2019s gonna be awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ll be around. I come down regularly to meet up with the boys, to hunt or fish or play poker. Even if there\u2019s no building to do here, there\u2019s always that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be taking the baby up to Grants Pass to see Matt\u2019s folks. I\u2019ll call you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d he said. He kissed her forehead, then leaned down to kiss the baby\u2019s forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you soon, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>He went out front where the general and Tom waited, and Vanessa followed. He shook Walt\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you for everything, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in your debt.\u201d</p><p>Paul gave his hand to Tom, then pulled him in for a hug. \u201cI\u2019m damn proud of you, son,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a hard thing, what you did. I hope it all works out okay.\u201d And as Paul said that, the general patted his son\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Tom said, but he looked down when he said it. Then, raising his head, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too, bud. Maybe I\u2019ll get down here for graduation or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re welcome anytime. Standing reservation,\u201d Walt said.</p><p>Paul nodded, picked up his duffel and suitcase, walked out to the road and threw them in the backseat of the extended-cab truck. He gave a wave and a toot of the horn as he drove off. He watched in the rearview mirror as Walt put an arm around Tom\u2019s shoulders and led him away. But Vanessa stayed, patting the little bundle she pressed to her shoulder, watching as he drove away.</p><p>Maybe someday, he thought. Maybe someday.</p><p>Jack put the last of the boxes from the cabin into the back of his truck and leaned into the cab to blow the horn. Mel came out of the cabin and just stood on the porch, turning in a circle. She brushed a little imaginary dust off the arm of one of the Adirondack chairs. He shook his head and smiled. She was having a really hard time leaving, even though the new house was big and beautiful.</p><p>\u201cMel, come on,\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cComing,\u201d she said. But she stood there a while longer. She was getting a nice little tummy on her now. She wore jeans, boots and a yellow sweater pulled down over her belly, her golden hair falling in thick curls over her shoulders and down her back. She was such a little thing; she could look like a pregnant teenager, standing up there like that. But as Jack knew too well, this was no girl. His woman was all woman.</p><p>He went to her because she wasn\u2019t moving very fast. He took the porch steps in one long stride, lifted her chin and saw that she had tears in her eyes. \u201cYou going to cry again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWe own the place now, Mel. You\u2019re not giving it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just remembering,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember that night you brought me home and put me to bed after I\u2019d had a couple of whiskeys on an empty stomach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you left fishing gear for me to find when I woke up in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, happy with the picture in his head of her wearing her brand-new waders and casting into the yard from the Adirondack chair. \u201cI really thought I was going to get lucky that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got lucky in that cabin more times than I can count,\u201d she said. \u201cDavid was born in that bed,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTalk about getting lucky.\u201d He laughed and pulled her into his arms. \u201cAnytime you want to sneak out here and revisit the past, I\u2019m your man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m remembering how it was when I first got here\u2014there was a bird\u2019s nest in the oven.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cYou rebuilt this whole cabin for me\u2014trying to get me to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe second I saw you, I was doomed. I don\u2019t know what would have become of me if you hadn\u2019t stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have fewer children, I think. Jack, I had so many happy days and nights in this little cabin. My whole life was changed here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd mine. Now come on, honey. We have a new house waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll be as happy in that new house as we\u2019ve been here?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her nose. \u201cI guarantee it. Now, come on.\u201d</p><p>With a heavy sigh she walked down the porch steps with him and got into the truck. She watched out the window dreamily as they drove through town and up the drive that had become her drive, feeling moody and nostalgic as though she was moving to another state when it was really less than a twenty-minute drive. She sighed again as she got out of the truck and walked toward the new porch, the new house.</p><p>He grabbed her hand and pulled her back. Then, lifting her into his arms, he carried her into the house and stood just inside the doorway, holding her. It was fabulous\u2014Paul had clearly outdone himself. The floors were shiny hardwood, the ceiling of the great room was vaulted and beamed, the new tan leather furniture that sat around the stone hearth was lush and inviting. He walked farther into the house, past a beautiful, huge modern kitchen, which he believed would be the center of many gatherings in the future. Silver appliances, black granite counters, dark polished oak cabinets and a long oak table that could seat ten or more.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He carried her into a spacious master bedroom with king-size bed and large, man-sized bureaus. \u201cTaking a little tour.\u201d He pointed her toward the big new bed. \u201cHow do you like your new playpen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she said, laughing and tightening her arms around his neck.</p><p>He kissed her, a long, deep and lusty kiss. \u201cI think we have time to christen the new house before Brie and Mike bring David out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack, we have things to do around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe certainly do,\u201d he said, laying her gently on the bed and leaning down to pull off her boots. \u201cYes, we do.\u201d</p> <p>The sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s detectives were extremely cooperative in letting Mike listen in on some of the interviews they conducted with both Jordan Whitley, Brendan Lancaster and students who may or may not have been victimized by the suspects. He considered it very fortunate that only three Virgin River girls seemed to have fallen prey, because there were others around Valley High School who appeared to be suspiciously likely to have been drugged and raped. And, as Tom had suspected, there were more drugs involved\u2014what was referred to as white dope. Two short weeks after these young men were apprehended a fount of information and piles of reports had been generated and confessions were falling like raindrops around the county ADA.</p><p>Brie\u2019s reputation as a prosecutor extended beyond the boundaries of the Sacramento Valley, and when she offered her services as a consultant to the local district attorney, they welcomed her help gratefully. The one thing she never thought she\u2019d be able to do she did extremely well\u2014she assisted in interviewing teenage girls who were likely rape victims. Her skills were impressive, but it was her compassion and finesse that probably assisted in prepping at least one girl for a possible trial. Carra Jean Winslow knew exactly what had happened to her, and who had raped her.</p><p>The most interesting thing to Mike\u2014and so unsurprising as well\u2014was that these boys, Whitley and Lancaster, were singularly unimpressive. They were neither clever nor savvy\u2014they were simply idiots with access to dangerous drugs and the opportunity to use them. Lancaster had been present at a couple of raves held in a larger town down the coast where he had located and purchased GHB, sharing his wealth with Whitley. He also had a local marijuana dealer he worked with, and traded pot for meth and ecstasy. He had the stuff and was dealing. It boiled down to teens in search of a good time and the misfortune to have ended up being around these two losers.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take Lancaster long to flip and turn on his suppliers. This delighted Delaney, who\u2019d been looking hard for white-dope dealers. He was also willing to flip on Whitley\u2014he was pretty much the only witness to the rapes. Unfortunately for Whitley, the only person he could turn over was Lancaster\u2014so it looked as if the rape charges might stick.</p><p>No names of teenagers were published in the local papers, but that didn\u2019t keep the word from spreading. In Virgin River, Mike found some of his neighbors wanted to express their gratitude for his work. He was given a case of good wine, half a butchered calf, a dozen jars of canned tomatoes that were put up last summer. He pulled a couple of bottles of wine from the case for Brie, but took the rest of the wine and produce to Preacher. Since he\u2019d taken his job, Jack and Preacher hadn\u2019t allowed him to pay anything for his meals at the bar. That was the way things worked around here. All for one, one for all...</p><p>Mike leaned against his SUV, waiting outside the sheriff\u2019s department for someone, a young woman who had just completed her third round of questions with detectives. When Brenda Carpenter came out, a svelte young blue-jeaned girl with a book bag slung over her shoulder, he pushed off the car. \u201cHey,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she returned.</p><p>\u201cI talked your dad into letting me give you a lift home. I thought maybe you and I could have a few minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d she asked with a shrug. \u201cThere can\u2019t possibly be anything more you want to ask me. Not now.\u201d</p><p>He opened the passenger door for her. \u201cNah. No more questions. But I might want to tell you a couple of things.\u201d</p><p>She gave a heavy sigh, but needing that ride, she got in. Mike hurried to the driver\u2019s side, because once they were under way, she couldn\u2019t refuse to go with him. \u201cBrenda, it was very brave, what you did,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have that much of a choice,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, but you did. You could have lied, you could have refused to talk to anyone, you could have feigned sick.... I can think of a hundred ways you could\u2019ve been unhelpful\u2014but you gutted it out. And knowing what that meant to you, I just wanted to thank you.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cWhy thank me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s my town\u2014you\u2019re my family, my people. If I\u2019m doing my job, I try to make sure you\u2019re safe. Believe me, I know from personal experience how hard it is to answer some of those questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Your wife,\u201d she said. \u201cYou must think I\u2019m a pretty big sissy for holding out so long after what your wife was brave enough to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, Brenda. Number one, my wife is thirty-one. Number two, she\u2019s not only a lawyer, but one with experience in prosecuting dangerous criminals. Three\u2014she had some serious backup in me and Jack and many others. You\u2019re just a kid who was never sure what happened to you. You were up against a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, kiddo. For me and Brie\u2014we\u2019ve been through some scary stuff and have kind of thick hides by now. Now all we want is a peaceful life in a peaceful town.\u201d He laughed. \u201cJesus, I hope that\u2019s not asking too much.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a long moment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you went through all that. I know what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, I know you do,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s behind us now. We want a family, you know. You get to be my age, you don\u2019t want to miss too many chances at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you proud of her? Your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, kid,\u201d he said in a breath. \u201cShe was amazing. She was so afraid, so sick inside, so vulnerable.... But one thing you learn as you get older\u2014it\u2019s usually better to face the threat and the fear than try to dodge it. In the end the most important thing is that you have no regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s never as bad as you fear?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cDid someone tell you that? Because sometimes it is as bad as you fear, or even worse. And sometimes you have to do it anyway, because the kind of life you\u2019re left with if you don\u2019t isn\u2019t really of the same value. Brie is a perfect example of that. She went after that guy for raping women, knowing that if she couldn\u2019t get him, he would be free to hurt more women and even free to go after her. But ignoring him would not only have the same effect, she would have to add to it that she never tried to do the right thing. Double pain. Double regret. To try your hardest and then fail\u2014no shame in that. To do nothing? It just ends up being harder to live with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe detective said he doesn\u2019t know what will happen to those guys... Doesn\u2019t even know if there will be a trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t even know if they\u2019ll do time. I think almost all the drug charges were pled down for information that will help the police with bigger cases. I don\u2019t think they pled down any of the sexual assault, but if I were Whitley\u2019s lawyer, I\u2019d talk him into a plea agreement rather than a trial. He goes to trial, he\u2019s so cooked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Brenda\u2014he\u2019s over eighteen, barely. He\u2019s outta here\u2014he won\u2019t be back in school with you. Since he made bail, he\u2019s been in another city with his father. He isn\u2019t going to be back here. He\u2019d get tarred and feathered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if...?\u201d She stopped and thought a second. \u201cWhat if I\u2019d come forward sooner? Would I have saved anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut, honey, when your number was called, you stood up, you told the truth and you helped get the job done. You should be very proud of yourself. I\u2019m very proud of you. We all are.\u201d</p><p>The next afternoon at about four, Mike drove out to the general\u2019s house. He parked in front, but saw that there was someone down by the corral, forearms leaning on the top rail, one booted foot hoisted onto the bottom. That was who Mike was looking for and he walked down the small hill. \u201cTom,\u201d he said to the boy\u2019s back.</p><p>The boy turned, saw it was him and said, \u201cHow you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. How about you?\u201d Mike asked, joining him at the fence, aping his stance, one foot on the bottom rail, forearms on the top.</p><p>\u201cGetting by,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cYou having any trouble at school?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk, but I\u2019m not answering any questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of talk?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>Tom shrugged. \u201cSome people think they know that I got him caught, but no one\u2019s sure. Well, no one but Brenda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did a good piece of work there, Tom. I know that was tough.\u201d</p><p>Tom gave a huff of unamused laughter. \u201cYeah, but then again, no. I felt like I had two choices\u2014turn him over or just beat the living shit out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve felt exactly that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it coming together? You guys get the little prick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he is totally gotten. He started spilling his guts almost immediately. For a while there he thought he could put it on Lancaster\u2014but it turns out that Lancaster liked getting drunk and high, while it was Whitley\u2019s project to get the girls.\u201d</p><p>Tom winced. \u201cBeautiful. I should\u2019ve just killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have worn well on you. So, you\u2019re hanging in there?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI go to basic training with the Army right after graduation. Then the Point. I\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots of stuff going on between now and then. Prom and stuff...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m just doing time. I\u2019ll be gone before you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Brenda?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no girl, man. I sold her out. She\u2019s finished with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk. She won\u2019t even look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw her over at the sheriff\u2019s department\u2014she wears that bracelet you gave her. The pretty one with her name on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I think she\u2019s punishing me with it. Gives me false hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that wasn\u2019t quite it,\u201d Mike said. \u201cMaybe she was just scared and mad, but not really finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish,\u201d he said, leaning on the rail and looking down. \u201cNah, she said she hated me, and she\u2019s pretty much acting like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou regret what you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, can\u2019t get there,\u201d he said. \u201cThat guy had to be stopped. That stuff can\u2019t happen. It\u2019s wrong.\u201d He coughed. \u201cI knew there was a price.\u201d</p><p>Mike clamped a hand on his back. \u201cTom, a man who will do what he has to do even though there\u2019s a price, that\u2019s a man I want at my back when there\u2019s trouble. You did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said inconsolably. \u201cGlad you got him,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI brought someone to see you,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>Tom straightened. \u201cYeah? Who?\u201d</p> <p>Mike inclined his head over his shoulder and Tom turned. Behind him about twenty feet stood Brenda, her hands clasped in front of her. Tom looked at Brenda, at Mike, at Brenda again.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Tom said. \u201cBrenda?\u201d</p><p>He took a couple of steps toward her and she ran to him. Mike stepped back and watched with a melancholy smile on his face. Tom snatched her up into his arms, lifting her clear of the ground. She hugged his neck while he held her tight and he heard what sounded like laughter mixed up with tears. And then of course the sound was muffled because it was buried in kisses that were desperate and heartfelt.</p><p>\u201cYou can probably give her a ride home later,\u201d Mike said, though no one acknowledged that they\u2019d heard. He shook his head in silent laughter and started back up the hill. As he was nearing the house, he looked up to see the general in one of his big picture windows. Walt slowly lifted a hand toward Mike and saluted him.</p><p>Mike returned the salute.</p><p>When Mike got back to town, it was already dinnertime. He was ready for a beer, but he went to the RV first to see if Brie was back from helping her brother and sister-in-law at the new house\u2014a work in progress with wallpapering, unpacking, cleaning, settling. And he found she was there, wearing her bathrobe, patting dry her long hair with a towel. Every time his eyes even fell on her, he felt himself swell with pride that she would choose him.</p><p>It had been a long six weeks since the trial in Sacramento. The color was back in her cheeks, the sparkle in her eyes. Assisting the ADA in Humboldt County was gratifying for her; she was proud she could contribute. And she was enjoying the help she could give Mel and Jack, having a good time with her little nephew. It was so satisfying to know she felt secure and at peace once again. To have her in his life, to hold her and tell her he adored her, this was enough to make him feel as any king might feel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d he said, going to her for a kiss.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re very close to being all settled now. I papered the new baby\u2019s bedroom, with no help from Davie, I might add.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRavenous. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long day,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cAnd all that date-rape business? It\u2019s still falling into place for the ADA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than I could have hoped, acting alone as I was. They\u2019re doing a fantastic job with it, and you were instrumental in that. These people can have it behind them soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means we\u2019ll have it behind us,\u201d she said.</p><p>He threaded a hand under her long hair, gently massaging her neck. \u201cThere will be more cases for you, mija. Your skills are so valuable here. Thank you for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have other things to do, Miguel. For one thing, there\u2019s that baby. We need to get to work on that baby.\u201d</p><p>His grin was immediate and huge. \u201cI thought I had been working on the baby,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing your best, I\u2019m sure, if a little distracted by work. Now that all this stuff is handled, we can give it serious attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about takeout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent idea,\u201d she said, standing to loosen the belt around her robe.</p><p>A year and a half ago Mike Valenzuela lay in a coma in an L.A. hospital, his family wondering if he would live, and Brie Sheridan was trying to survive the reality of her husband abandoning her for another woman, and a few months later trying to recover from a violent crime. Neither had dared hope they would come out of these traumas with their health and sanity, much less a love that felt eternal. A love so fulfilling and endless that anything seemed possible. And yet for both of them, something had been born that exceeded their wildest fantasies.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how much I love you?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best part,\u201d she answered. \u201cI do.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
