She knew it was her scream, strangled and agonized, but it no longer sounded familiar to her. Reality had receded the day before, and it hadn\u2019t yet returned.</p><p>She had been dragged from her car just outside Baghdad, blindfolded, and shoved into a van. And that had been a walk in the park compared to the hours since.</p><p>\u201cHow much easier would it be, whore, to simply give us what we need?\u201d The muzzle of a handgun caressed her cheek. \u201cYou could die then. Quickly. There would be no more pain. Wouldn\u2019t that be nice? No more clamps attached to tender parts of your body. No more electricity. No more kicks. All you need to do is tell us who contacted you. Tell us the information they have.\u201d</p><p>The voice was an insidious whisper inside her head as she felt herself crying. Curled in on herself, shuddering with sobs.</p><p>Oh God, please don\u2019t let them hurt her anymore. She could feel the bruises along her body now, the swollen tenderness of her nipples, the fragility of bones that couldn\u2019t take much more abuse without breaking.</p> <p>They hadn\u2019t broken her yet. Had she managed to convince them she didn\u2019t know? That she was unaware of the illegal weapons pipeline they were buying their guns and explosives through? That she knew nothing of the information she had been sent to retrieve about the spy within Army Intelligence providing access to those weapons?</p><p>And what did she do with the information that only one person had known where she was headed and why?</p><p>\u201cSo easy,\u201d a voice crooned, and she focused on the accent. It wasn\u2019t Iraqi, she knew Iraqi. It wasn\u2019t Afghani. There were tonal differences in the voices, even when speaking the same language. She knew the difference. This voice was a whisper of something else. Someone else. She knew this voice.</p><p>Another blow landed and a scream tore from her as the toe of the boot connected with her ribs. Terror washed through her like an oily, dark wave of suffocating heat. They would break them next. If her ribs broke she wouldn\u2019t have a chance of escape. Naked, bruised, and hurting, hell yeah. She could escape given half a chance. But if they broke her ribs? If they caused internal bleeding? She would never make it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we will get to keep this one awhile,\u201d the voice mused, laughter filling the tone. \u201cI think maybe she enjoys our caresses, yes?\u201d</p><p>No. No. She shook her head, dry heaves shaking through her, torturing her as the spasms ripped through her body.</p> <p>\u201cYou do not like our touch?\u201d False sympathy filled the voice as he bent to her again. \u201cMaybe we use you and fill your belly with seed. We take your brat then and place it in a pretty stroller filled with explosives and park it in front of your White House. Who can resist a baby\u2019s cries, eh?\u201d</p><p>She fought to breathe.</p><p>Reality. Reality was birth control that had been administered before this mission. Reality was backup, somewhere. Her team didn\u2019t want to lose her or the information she had, but they could only rescue her if they knew she was missing. If the officer she had discussed the trip with had reported that she hadn\u2019t returned.</p><p>Reality was, she was beginning to suspect that officer may well be the leak they had been searching for in Army Intelligence.</p><p>Reality. She had to hold on, just a little bit longer. She had to find a way to escape, a way to get that information back to her superiors despite the disillusionment and the betrayal that seared her soul.</p><p>She felt a hand on her thigh, moving along the back of her leg, fingers touching her, probing.</p><p>Rage and terror blazed through her mind. Kicking out she fought to avoid the touch, tried to hurt or to maim, to piss him off enough to keep him away from her. She would prefer to be kicked. She would prefer the broken bones.</p><p>\u201cTell us, Greta.\u201d The voice sighed then, resignation in his tone as she heard the shuffling around her. \u201cRaping you would not be a pleasant experience for some reason. And raping you broken and unable to fight holds even less appeal. But if you do not give me what I need, I will spread you out here and I will let these guards use you. They will use you over and over again, until your body is so defiled that even your own people will know nothing but disgust for you. Is this what you want?\u201d</p> <p>The false gentleness in his tone built the fear inside her. He was going to do it. She knew he was. She had known all along that he would take this step. What better way to torture a woman? When the electrical clamps to her nipples and clitoris hadn\u2019t worked, he had gotten more inventive. His men hadn\u2019t raped her, but the painful device he used had.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bear more pain.</p><p>\u201cSuch a beautiful woman.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>Saudi. The accent was Saudi. She couldn\u2019t see him, her eyes were so swollen now she doubted she could see daylight if she was in it. But the accent, the voice.</p><p>\u201cNassar,\u201d she whispered, dazed, sobbing. \u201cYou betrayed us, Nassar?\u201d</p><p>And it only supported the fact that the man she suspected of betraying the Army was a traitor. Her husband. Nassar was his friend. His contact. And so, obviously, his coconspirator.</p><p>Silence filled the void for long moments. Nassar Mallah. She remembered him now. He was a contract agent for the CIA and one of their most trusted moles. Handsome, charming, his black eyes always twinkled with humor and a smile always curved his lips. She had never guessed, never known he was a traitor.</p><p>\u201cAh, Greta.\u201d He stroked her cheek again, but she had distracted him. He was no longer stroking the abused flesh between her thighs, no longer threatening to open her again, to destroy her with a helplessness she couldn\u2019t accept.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Shudders were working through her, and she knew she was finally going into shock.</p><p>Or perhaps they had meant to kill her slowly like this.</p><p>\u201cKill her.\u201d She felt him rise to his feet. \u201cUse her however you please first, but when you leave this cell, she is to be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Nassar,\u201d she cried out his name weakly. \u201cWe trusted you. We trusted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you trusted me. Fool that you were.\u201d She heard the shrug in his voice. \u201cEnjoy your last minutes, Greta. I doubt they will spend much time enjoying your broken body. But, with these four, you never know.\u201d</p><p>The cell door clanged shut. Her fingers tightened around the makeshift knife she had managed to sharpen against the stones earlier. It was gripped in her hand, tucked along her wrist and hidden beneath her body as they dragged her from the pallet.</p><p>Reality was, she was going to die here and she knew it.</p><p>Pop. She heard the sound, but it didn\u2019t make sense. She heard someone grunt, heard something fall.</p><p>Several more of the hollow, wet pops and more shuffling.</p><p>She knew that sound. Bullets. She couldn\u2019t see, but she knew the guards were dead. Frantically, she scrabbled at the floor, found one of them, and raced to tear his shirt off his torso. Buttons. God she hated buttons. She worked them loose with stiff, swollen fingers as she heard shouts, screams, and grunts outside the cell door.</p><p>The shirt came free, and she dragged it off his body before shoving her arms into it and wrapping it around her. There wasn\u2019t a chance she could rebutton it. Pants. She needed pants.</p><p>She was frantic. She worked fast, struggling, panting, trying to ignore the pain searing her body as she worked boots and pants off the guard.</p><p>She belted the pants on, feeling their length and filth around her. But they covered her. She would have to do without shoes.</p><p>Gun. She had the gun in her hand, and she couldn\u2019t fucking see. She was crying, her tears burning the cuts on her face, burning her eyes as she crept to the cell door.</p><p>It swung open, sunlight piercing her eyes for too long, shadows enveloping her as she brought the gun up while trying to strike out with the small wooden stake she had managed to hone.</p><p>\u201cChill!\u201d The voice was American, harsh as strong hands gripped her wrists, tore the gun and the stake from her hands and moved quickly behind her. \u201cExtraction in progress,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>Backup. He was reporting in. Extraction. SEALs? Were they SEALs?</p><p>\u201cYou got me, Faisal?\u201d</p><p>Hands were roving over her quickly.</p><p>\u201cSEALs?\u201d She gasped out.</p><p>\u201cI only wish,\u201d he snarled in her ear, his voice deep, like aged whiskey and soothing to her shattered senses. \u201cTry one lone fucking sniper and a teenage kid with more guts than good sense. Can you run?\u201d</p><p>His arm was around her, holding her against him. He was warm and protective. Was he protective or did she just need to convince herself that he was? Did she need this to survive the events of the past twenty-four hours?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see.\u201d And she wanted to see him. Wanted her senses in order, her thoughts clinical, as sharp as they had been yesterday.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll lead, you run?\u201d The suggestion was almost a croon, his voice almost tempting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll run.\u201d</p><p>He had her on her feet. Her bare feet. But she would be okay. She would run, anything to escape this cell, the hands touching her body, the voice at her ear, sinking into her head.</p><p>\u201cSmall cell here.\u201d He rushed her into the heat and blinding light. \u201cI think we got them all, but I\u2019m not betting on it. We have bogeys heading in a few miles out and tight quarters to hide in.\u201d</p><p>He was talking to her as he ran. Ran hard and fast, holding her against his side and taking most of her weight as she forced herself to keep up with him.</p><p>\u201cNassar?\u201d she questioned roughly. She hoped the bastard was dead.</p><p>\u201cRode out in the only gun jeep,\u201d he informed her. \u201cGave us our chance.\u201d</p><p>Nassar got away. But she had the information, had what she needed to fry his and her husband\u2019s asses, and she would do just that.</p><p>\u201cI need a radio,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI have to report in before he gets away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that.\u201d Hard, scathing, the voice was nonetheless comforting. It was American. Southern drawl, Kentucky if she wasn\u2019t mistaken. \u201cLook, little girl. I\u2019m on a short leash here and ammo is tight. I\u2019m a Marine sniper with no backup or comm until closer to extraction, or until the extraction team comes searching for me. I wouldn\u2019t even be here if your friend Faisal hadn\u2019t sent out a Mayday on shortwave and connected with my only comm. We gotta boogie and boogie hard, or both our asses are grass. Those bad boys back there are sure to make fine lawn mowers, too.\u201d</p><p>They were running uphill. He was barking commands. Gathering his guns, his pack. Getting ready to run again.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d She was fighting to breathe, to keep up.</p><p>\u201cBum-fucked nowhere.\u201d He was running full out and wasn\u2019t close to being winded. \u201cI have a hole a mile out. You\u2019re gonna have to hang on for the ride, sugar, \u2019cause we don\u2019t get there, we\u2019re all dead. And dead and me don\u2019t get along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe live? She live?\u201d Young, Iraqi, the boy\u2019s voice was frantic as the man paused for just a second. She knew the voice. Faisal was one of her informants. The young boy\u2019s courage was incredible.</p><p>\u201cShe lives, now boogie your ass, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoogie my ass, Natchie,\u201d the boy claimed. \u201cBoogie boogie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned kid.\u201d But there was affection in his voice. That affection, that sense of protectiveness that seemed to surround her, dug into her, made her chest ache from more than the run.</p><p>How long had it been since she had felt protected? Had she ever? But she did now. With this stranger\u2019s arm tight around her waist, half pulling her, half carrying her. Rescuing her. And Chaya had never been rescued in her life.</p><p>They were running full tilt. She couldn\u2019t see, her feet were bleeding, and her bruised ribs were in agony. But she was free. Reality was, she was free, and with just a little tiny miracle, she could stay free. But she knew those arms wouldn\u2019t always be there. That strength wouldn\u2019t always surround her, and she spared just a moment to regret that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Natches rushed the mile to the hole he had made the night before after Faisal\u2019s shortwave coded message had hit his radio. He\u2019d made the holes, prepared them, and then went after the girl the boy had seen hauled into the dump of a terrorist camp. A small enough camp, out of the way, populated by barely a dozen hard-eyed, fanatic bastards and one little American blonde.</p><p>Hell, who had been dumb enough to lose her? She was an agent, he could tell from the automatic stamina pushing her. She didn\u2019t have the strength to crawl on her own, but her legs were moving and she was fighting to help him as much as she could.</p><p>Faisal was easily staying at his side, his dark face creased with worry at the sound of gunfire behind them. They were out of sight as they rounded the low, rolling hill, and the hole was just ahead, covered deep with stripped trees and wrapped with dead brush. A natural part of the landscape.</p> <p>\u201cGet in the hole.\u201d He lifted the first cover and pushed Faisal into it with the supplies he would need in a smaller pack.</p><p>He threw himself and the girl into the second hole and jerked the secured covering over them as the sound of a helicopter began to hum from the direction of the terrorist base.</p><p>Of course, there had to be a fucking helicopter, he thought as he lifted himself enough to stare through the natural break he had created to see if they were followed. Fuck, he didn\u2019t need this.</p><p>The hole was deep enough to sit in, the upper natural covering strong enough to hold a tank, maybe. They were secure as long as the bastards didn\u2019t have dogs. It wasn\u2019t very long, wasn\u2019t very wide, but it was the best he could do on short notice.</p><p>\u201cDo you have extraction coming soon?\u201d Chaya rasped.</p> <p>He glanced back at her and winced. She was curled against the dirt wall, eyes swollen closed, her lips dry and cracked. She looked vulnerable, but the woman had a spine of steel.</p><p>\u201cI have a tracker on me. They\u2019ll find me when they get in close enough. When I wasn\u2019t at the first extraction point, they\u2019ll have followed the beacon I have on me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twisted mockingly. \u201cAre you sure? Collateral damage is the motto these days, you know.\u201d</p><p>Fuck wasn\u2019t that the truth. \u201cEvery good redneck knows you always have a plan B,\u201d he assured her. His team was all the plan A or B that he needed. Most snipers worked alone, but on this mission, he was numero uno and he knew it. They needed him too damned bad to allow him to become damaged.</p><p>She breathed out wearily as he pulled a canteen from his pack and uncapped it. \u201cHere. Drink slow.\u201d He lifted the water to her lips, staring at her face as she sipped.</p><p>\u201cI have some salve and bandages for your eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cBastards always go for the eyes first, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>She gave a small, bitter laugh. \u201cAt least second.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out the medical kit, smoothed the salve over her eyes, then secured bandages over them. She had the face of an angel, he thought. Fine bones, delicate cheekbones, pretty sensual lips, he bet. Right now they were bloody and swollen.</p><p>\u201cOld lady at home makes that salve,\u201d he told her. \u201cBastards caught me last year, just about tore my eyeballs out before I escaped. When I went home on leave, she made the salve and made me promise to keep it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKentucky,\u201d she whispered as the helicopter swept overhead.</p><p>\u201cLake Cumberland.\u201d He gently touched the scratches on her face with the salve.</p><p>She was a slender woman. Dirt caked her hair and smeared her face, but he bet she was a beauty before Nassar and his men got hold of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re New England.\u201d He nodded at her accent. \u201cDamn pretty area. Damned pretty girls.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was tired. \u201cThere\u2019s one less now.\u201d</p> <p>He sincerely doubted that. \u201cDid they rape you?\u201d</p><p>He was surprised at the fury that threatened to drown his common sense. Of course they raped her. They were known for it.</p><p>She shook her head and grimaced mockingly. \u201cThey didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did?\u201d He smeared the salve over her swollen lips as he caught the emphasis.</p><p>\u201cNassar has some interesting toys.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cBut he was tired of using them. His little buddies were going to do the deed when he left. Thanks for the timing by the way.\u201d</p><p>Natches sat back on his haunches and listened carefully for noise outside. There were no caves in this area. The next hill over had several. The area he had chosen was no more than a flat, uninteresting gorge. Nothing but some scrappy foliage and dead brush. The perfect place for a hole. They would check the area, but they would be more eager to hit the caves a mile away.</p><p>\u201cFaisal, your goat herder friend,\u201d he explained softly. \u201cHe saw Nassar bring you in. He\u2019s also got a handy-dandy military shortwave and an American Army sergeant for a buddy who taught him a little bit of code. That code caught me on my way back. I side-tracked to rescue you. All the guys at home are gonna be slapping my back for this one. I might even get a street named after me.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was slower. Dazed. She was slipping away from him and he couldn\u2019t allow that. \u201cFaisal\u2019s a good kid,\u201d she whispered, her head nodding to the side.</p><p>\u201cWake up there, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChaya. My name is Chaya.\u201d Her voice was soft, sweet. He liked her voice.</p><p>Damned pretty name for a damned pretty woman. He touched her cheek again.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Chay. Tell me where you\u2019re hurt. I need to fix as much as I can just in case we have to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeet. Bruised ribs, possible concussion. No internal bleeding, no broken bones.\u201d</p><p>She was drifting away from him.</p><p>Natches leaned in and touched her lips with his. Her head jerked back as she gasped. But her hands reached out for him, her fingers\u2014slender, fragile fingers\u2014clenching his wrists, tightening, as though she were afraid to let go of him, before she did just that. Slowly. Hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cThere, awake now?\u201d He moved to her feet, pulling one into his lap as he dragged the medical kit closer.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d She sounded shocked, but awake, aware.</p><p>\u201cMy kisses are potent,\u201d he bragged shamelessly, desperate to keep her grounded and aware. \u201cThey wake all the girls up.\u201d</p><p>He used a penlight to check her feet carefully, always listening, always tracking the sound of the helicopter overhead and the vehicles now moving through the ravines.</p><p>He peeked over the edge of the hole but couldn\u2019t see anything moving near enough to be deemed a threat.</p><p>He smoothed the salve over her feet, then pulled his shirt and T-shirt off. He tore the T-shirt into strips, padded her feet, then wrapped them with stretch gauze.</p><p>\u201cAll the girls like your kisses, do they?\u201d She still sounded awake.</p><p>\u201cThey beg for my kisses.\u201d It was nothing less than the truth, but as he stared at this woman, so strong, so determined, he wondered at the women he had known before. Would any of them have found the strength to make it this far? And he knew they wouldn\u2019t have. But this one, this one would never join in the Mackay games as the others had.</p><p>\u201cConceited.\u201d Her smile was tired, and worry lashed at him.</p><p>She was sheet white, pain and shock setting in now that she was still and no longer enfolded in complete terror. He couldn\u2019t risk shock. Not yet.</p><p>He dug in the med pack again and pulled free the potent pain pills he carried. \u201cTake this.\u201d He pushed it into her mouth and lifted the canteen to her lips again.</p><p>She sipped and then leaned her head back against the dirt wall behind her.</p><p>Silence filled the hole for long moments. Her breathing was short and erratic, and every few seconds she would flinch or grimace just enough that he caught the wary movements in her expressions.</p><p>He wanted to hold her. She was almost broken, maybe not physically, but mentally at the least. She had endured this far, he had to get her just a little further.</p><p>\u201cThe trucks are getting closer.\u201d There was weariness in her voice, but no fear yet.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll search for a while. I\u2019m good at this. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>He checked on Faisal\u2019s hole. It was silent. Faisal knew how to hide; it wasn\u2019t his first time, probably wouldn\u2019t be his last. He had everything he needed to stay secure as long as no one identified the hiding place Natches had made.</p><p>\u201cHow did they get you?\u201d he finally asked her when she said nothing else.</p><p>\u201cDragged me out of my car outside Baghdad, threw me in a van, beat the shit out of me, and played with some torture.\u201d She shrugged, but he heard the echo of horror in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have that they want?\u201d</p><p>She was an American woman and she had enough strength to strip a dead man and get his clothes on in the time it took him to pop a few heads and get to her location. She was an agent; he knew that from the comment she had made about needing to let someone know about Nassar. That was going to take a few hours at least.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything anyone wants,\u201d she said tiredly. \u201cI\u2019m a relief worker. I was working in Baghdad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pull no shit with me, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t pull none with me. You know how it goes.\u201d She copied his accent exactly. \u201cI have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he knew how it went. She couldn\u2019t disclose and he shouldn\u2019t be asking, but he was a nosy bastard and that was the truth.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t be long now. I\u2019ve already missed my bus,\u201d he stated. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not at extraction, they\u2019ll send a team out for me. I\u2019m important, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously more important than I am.\u201d She sighed. \u201cCan I take a nap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo naps.\u201d The helicopter was getting closer. He hoped Faisal had his deflecting blanket over his head. \u201cCome here; we gotta hunker down.\u201d</p><p>Fear flashed across her face for just a second as he unfolded the light, silver-backed blanket and pulled it over their heads, tucking it in carefully around them. So much as a foot sticking out from beneath it would allow any heat-seeking equipment to pick them up.</p><p>He had no idea what that helicopter was packing, and he wasn\u2019t taking any chances.</p><p>He was wrapped around her like a possessive lover now, and he could feel her fear as easily as he could feel the heat building beneath the blanket.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if I was back home, the ladies would be purring at being here with me,\u201d he pointed out to her as he smiled against her head. \u201cThey like my hard body. They think I\u2019m sexy.\u201d</p><p>A nervous laugh parted her lips as he rested his cheek against her hair.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see if you\u2019re sexy,\u201d she reminded him, and he hated that quiver in her voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re missin\u2019 out.\u201d He sighed pitifully, his voice whisper soft. \u201cI\u2019m damned fine, Chay. Green eyes and a nice tan. I got hard abs. Black hair. The women drool over me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, listened carefully, and was thankful to feel a small measure of the fear ease from her. He didn\u2019t consider himself particularly handsome, but he knew what the ladies said. He had to distract her though, and this was all that mattered.</p><p>\u201cConceited, too.\u201d Her hands were clenched tight around his lower arms, broken nails digging into his flesh.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah, I am. I\u2019m spoiled as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaying? Escaping the marriage market?\u201d He held her closer as the sound of the helicopter hovering overhead had her shuddering against him. The camouflaged top of the blanket, added to the dead brush secured to the narrow timbers above them, would hide them from sight. He had a moment to worry about Faisal, then pushed it away. If they were caught, they were probably dead anyway, despite the extraction team that he knew would be barreling its way to him.</p><p>He had pictures, layouts, troop movements, and hidden terrorist bases. He\u2019d been out in bum-fucked nowhere for six weeks now after completing the primary mission he had been sent on to aid in the extraction of another captured agent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That agent had been rescued. So why hadn\u2019t a team been sent out for this one?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting closer.\u201d Her voice was a breath of terror.</p><p>\u201cNo worries, baby. By nightfall, we\u2019re going to be safe and sound and celebrating with some homemade shine I\u2019m saving just for the end of this mission. I\u2019ll get you drunk and seduce you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeduce me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d He held her closer. \u201cI\u2019ll lay you down and kiss every bruise, then lick all the hurt away.

Sweaty and hot and doing things that might make both of us blush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you don\u2019t blush.\u201d She buried her face in his chest at the sound of voices shouting in Arabic.</p> <p>\u201cI bet you could make me blush.\u201d He kissed the top of her head and smiled, triumph singing through him at the feel of the light vibration of the radio at his thigh. \u201cYou gonna make me blush tonight, sugar? I just got signal.\u201d He took her hand and laid it against the radio. \u201cFive minutes and hell is gonna sweep through here.

The Mackays weren\u2019t stupid, but sometimes her boss liked to pretend they were, and that was a very big mistake, especially in light of the fact that Cranston really wasn\u2019t a fool.</p><p>She stared around the area before brushing back her dark blond hair and resigning herself to the inevitable.</p><p>Dawg Mackay had led her on a merry chase, and he had known exactly what he was doing. Through twisting hollows, up steep mountain roads that barely passed as trails, and into the thick forests that surrounded Lake Cumberland like a protective lover.</p><p>She would find her way out, eventually, but there was no doubt she was stuck for the night. Her satellite phone wasn\u2019t cooperating for some reason, the cell phone had no reception, and night was coming on.</p><p>She straightened from the crouch where she had found the locator another agent had placed beneath the Mackay vehicle, propped her hands on her hips, and stared around the thick forest surrounding her.</p><p>It would have been enjoyable if she\u2019d been prepared. Simple things like enough water to get her through the night, a sleeping bag maybe. She did have her weapon. And her thoughts. Too many thoughts the longer she stayed in Somerset\u2014the longer she was around Natches Mackay and all the memories she tried to push behind her.</p> <p>She shook her head and reached inside her back pocket for the habit she had picked up again in the past few months, only to find the cigarette pack she had stuck there earlier empty. Great.</p><p>Shaking her head, she wadded up the pack and tossed it into the back of the borrowed jeep her boss had had waiting for her just outside of Somerset, after she had reported the direction Dawg and his lover, Crista Jansen, had been heading in.</p><p>Crista Jansen looked too damned much like the woman brokering a missile sale between hijackers and terrorists to suit the Department of Homeland Security. It had been her job to follow Crista, to keep an eye on her and whoever she met with.</p><p>Knowing Dawg Mackay, Crista Jansen was meeting with nothing less than every inch of that Kentucky native\u2019s hard body. Dawg wasn\u2019t a traitor. He wanted those missiles as much as they did, and it was apparent he believed his woman was innocent.</p><p>But, hell, everyone thought the person they loved was innocent. Human nature had a tendency to overlook the truth whenever it wanted to. She had learned that lesson herself, the hard way.</p><p>Always the hard way. And look at what she had lost. Sometimes Chaya wondered if she hadn\u2019t lost her soul in a desert so bleak it sucked the spirit out of a person.</p><p>She snorted at that thought as she kicked at a clump of grass and leaned against her car, determined to enjoy just a few minutes of being unreachable by her boss, Timothy Cranston. No doubt he was frantically calling both the cell and sat phones. And here she stood, breathing in the fresh mountain air, feeling the peace of the place wrap around her, sink inside her.</p><p>Beseeching her to relax. To remember. To remember one night. One man. Urging her to close her eyes and to remember his touch. A touch filled with tears and her sobs, but also with his gentleness, with the warmth of his kisses, the heat of his possession. A night she only remembered in her dreams.</p><p>Her lips kicked up in a grin at the thought. Yeah, relax and drop her guard. Hadn\u2019t she done that before? And hadn\u2019t she paid for it? Hadn\u2019t she lost everything she loved in life because she had trusted the wrong person? And here she was, a part of her wishing, regretting things she knew she had no right to regret.</p><p>Strong arms that didn\u2019t hold her through the night. A voice like aged whiskey that didn\u2019t rasp her name with heated passion at his release. Hands, calloused and possessive. And she regretted, because that illusion was the most dangerous one she could ever reach out for.</p><p>A second later an unexpected sound had her jerking her weapon from the holster at the small of her back and taking aim at the front of the car.</p><p>She knew who it was. She took the precaution of waiting, watching, but the sound of the jeep rolling up the mountain was unmistakable. Powerful, a hard, male throb of power that her piece-of-crap borrowed jeep didn\u2019t have.</p><p>At least he was driving up in front of her rather than slipping through the trees and taking aim. He could have taken her out before she knew what hit her. And he would. No matter how well he knew her, no matter the short history they had shared so long ago, he would put a bullet between her eyes as fast as he would an enemy combatant if he felt she was a threat.</p><p>She held the Glock comfortably, confidently, as the wicked black vehicle pulled over the rise. If a jeep could strut, it strutted up the mountain and caused her to grit her teeth. Cranston could make her crazy running her in circles, but he couldn\u2019t give her a vehicle decent enough to make those circles in.</p><p>Tall tires, gleaming paint job, and a black pipe bumper. A winch at the front, the top pulled back, the man behind the wheel staring back at her from behind dark glasses, hiding those incredible green eyes.</p><p>But nothing could hide his somber expression as he jumped from the driver\u2019s seat, the engine still idling, throbbing. Like the rumble of a monstrous cat.</p><p>This was the dream, and the illusion. And somehow she had known he would be here. Here, in the mountains that bred him, as strong, as secure, as dangerously primitive as the man himself. As dangerous as the regrets that whispered through her as she watched him.</p><p>Chaya licked her lips slowly, staring back at him, trying not to notice the smooth, corded grace of his body. The way his jeans hung low on his hips and drew attention to his thighs. The way his gray T-shirt snugged over taut abs. The aura of power and male grace that seemed to ooze from the pores of his heavily tanned skin.</p><p>The wind ruffled through his overly long black hair, whipping it across his forehead and along the nape of his neck. Those thick, tempting strands had her hands itching to touch them, her fingers curling into fists to restrain the need.</p><p>Hell, she needed that cigarette bad now. She\u2019d been working with him for months, and she still couldn\u2019t dampen the sickening nerves, the pain each time he came near her. The need. Oh God, the need wrapped around her until sometimes she wondered if it would eventually drive her insane. The need to touch. Just one more time, just one touch, one kiss, one more night to hide within his arms.</p><p>Instead, she tucked her weapon back into its holster and shoved her hands into the pockets of her jeans as she watched him. The way he moved. The intensity in his forest green eyes, the knowledge in his expression. There was always that knowledge, the words that whispered just below the surface, the memories that never really went away. The hunger that never really receded.</p><p>Natches moved lazily to the front of the jeep and leaned against the heavy bumper. He stared at her, unsmiling, as he crossed one booted foot over the other and eased the dark glasses from his face.</p><p>Piercing green eyes tore into her senses, scrambled her brain and had her heart throbbing like a schoolgirl\u2019s. Summer\u2019s heat rushed around her then, stroking over her body and reminding her, always reminding her, of things she shouldn\u2019t let herself remember.</p><p>\u201cBusted.\u201d He lifted his brows mockingly. \u201cWant to tell me why you\u2019re following my cousin and his woman?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted as she fought to drag in more breath. He could do that. Make her breathless. Make her want. With only a look, he made her feel like a virgin on the verge of her first kiss. And that was very dangerous. He was dangerous. In more ways than one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not answering me, Chaya.\u201d He was one of the few people who dared to call her by her given name rather than the name she used in the agency. Greta. It was nice and plain and unassuming. But he had to call her Chaya instead. He had to remind her of who she had once wanted to be rather than who she was.</p><p>She licked her lips again, fighting for her composure.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Cranston.\u201d She was not taking the blame for this. \u201cHis orders. I just live to obey them.\u201d That was nothing less than the truth in the past few years. He controlled her. For now.</p><p>Natches shook his head, straightened, and moved closer. Standing her ground wasn\u2019t easy. She wanted to run. She wanted to run to him, touch him, stroke all that hard, dark flesh, and let the intensity of these dangerous desires free.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t married anymore, she reminded herself. She had been reminding herself of that for years.</p><p>She watched him, wary, suspecting the danger that lurked beneath that easy smile. Suspected nothing, she knew it lurked there. She knew she was facing a man who at one time had been a cold, hard killer. He had been taken into sniper training within six months of his enlistment with the Marines and within a year was ranked as one of their most proficient assassins.</p><p>And now he was retired. Bum shoulder. He liked to grin when claiming the injury that pulled him out of the Marines. She doubted a single cell on his body was \u201cbum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Chaya . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Greta,\u201d she grated out. \u201cUse it, Natches.\u201d She had to find some kind of defense against him. The name Greta reminded her, kept the memories of the one mistake that had shaped her uppermost in her mind.</p><p>\u201cChaya.\u201d His lips caressed the words as he drew closer, within a breath of her, forcing her to stare up at him. \u201cDarlin\u2019. Cranston\u2019s gonna get you in a shitload of trouble. You know this, right?\u201d</p><p>Oh God, if she didn\u2019t know it before, she was finding out now. She had thought working with Cranston would make her life easier, that the team that worked stateside only would ease her slowly away from the horror of the past and allow her to step out of the world that had begun to smother her.</p><p>\u201cTake it up with Cranston.\u201d She forced the words from her throat as his hand curled around the side of her neck and the dark, sexual light in his wicked eyes began to gleam with intent.</p><p>That touch, just like that, the implied power and gentleness of that hold, had her knees weakening. She was a trained agent; she wasn\u2019t supposed to let emotion or lust cloud her judgment. But right now it was clouding her entire mind.</p><p>His fingers flexed against her neck, the power and strength in his arm echoing along her nerve endings. Pleasure corrupted her normally logical thought processes and eroded the control she had fought for over the years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly, she was in the dark, fighting to breathe through the agony of a hell she couldn\u2019t accept, holding on to only one thing. Holding on to Natches\u2019s touch.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let herself hold on to that memory.</p><p>Chaya didn\u2019t bother to struggle. She could see the desire already burning in his eyes, and she knew she didn\u2019t have a chance against him if those luscious lips actually touched hers. She would be lost in him, and she couldn\u2019t afford to ever lose herself again.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t kiss me, Natches. Don\u2019t do that to me. Please.\u201d</p><p>He froze, those fingers contracting on her flesh, stroking cells that hadn\u2019t known a man\u2019s touch in so very long.</p><p>He had no idea how hard it was to turn away, to walk away. How she ached at night, tossing and turning in her bed, the thought of the promise in those cat\u2019s eyes of his burning through her soul. She wanted him with a strength that terrified her.</p><p>\u201cGive me one reason why I shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said, his voice low as those fingers stroked against her flesh. \u201cYou\u2019re not married anymore, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>His gaze wasn\u2019t mocking now; it was somber, intense. The memories flashed in his eyes as well, and she couldn\u2019t bear it. It connected them, made it so much harder for her to break away, to hold herself steady as she fought through the never-ending abyss of emotions that threatened to swamp her.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t handle you, and we both know it. Have mercy, Natches. Don\u2019t you have enough women in your little stable? You really don\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>And there was no way she would survive it. He was wild, intense, the most wickedly alluring man she had ever met in her life. And he wasn\u2019t the man for her. She wanted him until she ached with a force that tore at her soul, and she couldn\u2019t allow herself to have him. This man, the one who fired her soul, who made her dream when she had no right to dream.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good enough reason.\u201d</p><p>She gasped as his lips covered hers. Sensation exploded through her body; pleasure rippled and waved over her nerve endings and began to burn along her flesh. This kiss, this man, he was like nectar, like a drug she couldn\u2019t get out of her system.</p><p>She gasped harder as her weapon dropped to the ground and she felt Natches\u2019s hands tugging at her shirt, baring her, allowing the warmth of the sun-filled air to touch her flesh.</p><p>She told herself the perspiration was from the heat of the day, but she knew better. It was from his kiss.</p> <p>Oh God. His kiss. She flattened her hands against his chest to push him away, but he wasn\u2019t budging. His hands stroked up her back, beneath her shirt, then around, the pads of his fingers at the tender swells of her breasts, covered by nothing more than lace.</p><p>Chaya struggled with the war waging within her now. Her body, eager, desperate, it knew this man\u2019s touch, knew his possession. Her heart, her head, was screaming out in warning.</p><p>And her body was winning.</p><p>\u201cAh, Chay.\u201d He nipped at her lips. She loved that sexy little sting and lifted closer, begging for more. \u201cThere you go, baby. Show me how you can burn again.\u201d</p><p>She breathed in sharply as his hands slid to her hips, gripping them and lifting her until she was sitting on the hood of the jeep, then lying back, his big body pressing her down as her hands tugged at his shirt.</p><p>She should be pushing him away, not baring that gorgeous body. But that was what she was doing. Baring all that hard, delicious muscle. Feeling the rasp of crisp chest hairs against her palms, the dampness of his sweat beneath.</p><p>She twisted under him, feeling his knee press between her thighs, and saw stars explode behind her closed lashes as he pressed against the sensitive flesh between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah.\u201d He groaned against her lips as he worked her jeans loose. \u201cBurn for me, Chaya. Just a little bit. Burn for me wild and sweet, sweetheart, just like you do in my dreams.\u201d</p> <p>His voice was rough, tight with arousal, and she knew it could become guttural. That his drawl could slur his words and make him sound drunk with passion. She wanted that sound. She wanted him drunk on her.</p><p>\u201cNatches!\u201d She cried his name as his hand pushed beneath her open jeans and his fingers found her. Found the slick, too-thick layer of juices that prepared her for him, that betrayed her need.</p><p>That need was killing her.</p><p>She twisted, arched to him as his lips slid down her neck to her breasts. His teeth rasped the tender tip of a nipple as his free hand pulled the cup of her bra beneath the swollen mound.</p><p>Then his mouth was covering it, his lips closing on it, sucking it inside with tight, hard pressure that sent sensation ripping to her womb.</p><p>Long, broad fingers speared inside her vagina, drawing another cry from her. Flesh unused to any touch but her own since he had taken her so long ago. Too long.</p><p>She came instantly. The stretching heat, the feel of his mouth sucking her nipple, his tongue lashing her, it was too much. She exploded in a prism of light and color, his name on her lips and in her heart.</p><p>Oh God, she was never going to be free of him. And in this moment, exploding around his fingers, she wondered if she ever wanted to be.</p><p>She struggled to open her eyes, then lost her breath as she watched him. He pulled his fingers free of her, lifted them, and tasted her. Right there, beneath the sun, the breeze whipping around them, he opened his lips and sucked the taste of her from his fingers.</p><p>\u201cNatches.\u201d She could barely do more than breathe his name when his face suddenly stilled, his head lifting, like an animal scenting danger.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch Cranston.\u201d He was jerking her bra in place and pulling her shirt down when she caught the sound of a helicopter coming closer.</p><p>Pulling back from her, Natches let her fix her jeans, his green eyes filled with mocking amusement as the helicopter flew around the sheltering trees and came over the clearing.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t land, but she knew who it was. The Department of Homeland Security had found her. They had nearly seen more than she could have safely gotten away with.</p><p>Natches drew farther back from her, his expression hardening. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll lead you back to the main road. Then you can call Cranston and tell him to meet with me. I\u2019ve had enough of this crap. It ends now.\u201d</p><p>What was going to end now she wasn\u2019t certain, but she was more than ready to get the hell out of there, away from him. Let Cranston deal with him, because she knew, as sure as she was standing there she knew, there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell that she could handle him.</p><p>ONE</p><p>Somerset, Kentucky</p><p>October, One Year Later</p><p>Natches Mackay sat silently in the jeep and watched as Chaya Dane hauled her luggage into the hotel she had reserved in town. The Suites were just that. A nice hotel that offered a variety of live-in suites with a bedroom, a small living room, and a kitchenette for those required to be in town for an extended stay.</p><p>Chaya was registered for a two-week stay but the luggage she brought wouldn\u2019t have kept one woman for four days. A single large suitcase, an overnight bag, and a laptop case. She was definitely traveling light.</p><p>Eyes shaded behind the dark lenses of his sunglasses, he rubbed the short growth of beard at the side of his jaw and considered this new development.</p><p>It had been a year since she had been in town. A year since he had pulled the trigger and buried a bullet in his first cousin\u2019s head. And seeing her again brought the memories he tried to suppress back in vivid detail.</p><p>Johnny Grace had been a disgrace. He had masterminded the hijacking of a missile shipment as well as the sale of the weapons, and attempted to place the blame on a young woman who his other cousin Dawg Mackay was in love with. To add insult to injury, he had then attempted to kill her when he found out Dawg was onto him.</p><p>Saving Crista hadn\u2019t been easy, and Natches had known, as he drove to the rendezvous point where Johnny Grace was meeting his lover and coconspirator, that Johnny wouldn\u2019t leave there alive. It was a promise Natches had made to himself. Rowdy and Dawg were family, like no one else was. If it hadn\u2019t been for them and Rowdy\u2019s father, Ray, Natches wouldn\u2019t have survived the turmoil of his own life when he was younger.</p><p>People who knew the Mackays knew you didn\u2019t strike out at one of them. All of them came running if you did. And Rowdy\u2019s and Dawg\u2019s wives, Kelly and Crista, were strictly hands-off. It was hands-off or Natches would go hunting.</p><p>Johnny should have known better. He should have known Natches would be waiting with a bullet for him. But the little fucker had been convinced he could pull it off without anyone being the wiser.</p><p>His death had ended the investigation. The missiles had been recovered, the prospective buyers had been arrested, and all was supposed to be right in this little part of the world. Not that Natches slept any easier at night, but he had found a measure of peace. That peace had been hard-won over the past five years, and he had been enjoying the hell out of it.</p><p>Until last year.</p><p>He watched as Chaya disappeared into the hotel. Chaya was the pet agent of Timothy Cranston, the special agent in charge of investigations. She was his gopher and shit wrestler, and as much as it grated on Natches to see her following the snide little man\u2019s orders, he had still considered her rather intelligent. Smart enough that he had tried to stay the hell away from her.</p><p>Maybe she wasn\u2019t as smart as he had thought. Because she was back here, and he\u2019d be damned if any of his sources had warned him of an operation going down here.</p><p>What that operation was, either no one knew, or no one was telling him.</p><p>He rubbed at his lower lip and stared at the hotel entrance she had disappeared into. She hadn\u2019t looked happy to be back\u2014she\u2019d looked worn, tired, as though she had slept about as much as he had in the past year. Which amounted to less than nothing. And she looked damned good enough to eat. Unfortunately, she wasn\u2019t much into being a snack for him.</p><p>So why was Miss Dane currently taking up residence in his fair town again? It had to be under orders, because he\u2019d warned her, she wasn\u2019t safe here, least of all from him. If she wanted to keep to that cold, lonely bed of hers then she should have found another town to sleep in.</p><p>He was brought out of his contemplation when his cousin Rowdy pulled his pickup in beside the jeep. On the other side, Dawg pulled in, his black dual cab taking up space and rumbling like the powerful machine it was.</p><p>He glanced to each side, taking in his cousins as they moved from the vehicles. The wind shifted through Dawg\u2019s black hair, which wasn\u2019t near as long as he used to wear it, but Rowdy\u2019s hair, an identical black, was longer.</p><p>Married life was keeping them decent in too damned many ways. Dawg had a decent haircut, and Rowdy let his grow out. Dawg was broader than the other cousin, a few years older. They were both just as damned powerful and irritating as they ever were.</p><p>And irritating they could be. Married and shackled and tied so damned tight to their wives that if a man just breathed in those women\u2019s directions, their hackles rose. But they still came when he called, and the thought of that tugged at something inside him. One of those bits of emotion that he fought to keep buried and hidden.</p><p>As they came up beside his jeep, Natches opened the door and stepped out slowly, his gaze still centered on the building. He\u2019d called the little girl on duty at the front desk before he arrived to make certain Miss Dane was given the proper room.</p><p>One that looked right out on the parking lot. He wanted her to see him, wanted her to know she was being watched.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s brewin\u2019, Natches?\u201d Dawg leaned against Rowdy\u2019s gray pickup, his arms crossing over his broad chest.</p><p>Natches lifted a brow as he took in the pressed jeans and white shirt his cousin was wearing. It was a damned far cry from the holey, scruffy appearance his cousin had before he picked back up with Crista Ann Jansen last year.</p><p>\u201cSnazzy-looking duds there, cuz.\u201d Natches grinned. \u201cCrista iron those for you herself with her own little hands?\u201d</p><p>Dawg scowled back at him, but his light green eyes, nearly a celadon in color, flared with impatient arousal at the mention of his wife. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDry cleaners,\u201d Dawg finally growled. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you called us here to discuss my laundry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch him, Natches.\u201d Rowdy grinned, his dark green eyes, sea green, crinkling at the corners with mirth. \u201cDawg\u2019s been a hair upset over the laundry. Crista put her foot down over the wrinkled, hole-ridden T-shirts he likes wearing to the store. She won\u2019t let him play the disinterested owner anymore.\u201d</p><p>Dawg grunted as Natches smirked absently and glanced back toward the hotel.</p> <p>\u201cThat call you made earlier sounded kind of important, dumb ass.\u201d Dawg sighed as he addressed Natches again. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Natches turned back to him, glaring at his cousin for the nickname that was becoming more frequent.</p><p>\u201cYou keep calling me \u2018dumb ass,\u2019 and I\u2019m going to split your head open for you.\u201d</p><p>Dawg grunted and it was his turn to smirk. \u201cI think it suits you. You go moving out of your houseboat, for solitude over that damned garage, and start working like a man who\u2019s grown some principles, and I start worrying about you.\u201d</p><p>Natches\u2019s nostrils flared as anger began to churn inside him. Damn Dawg. He didn\u2019t need his damned advice or his snide-assed comments, which pretty much described the reason why his cousin was calling him names. Because he refused to listen to either.</p> <p>\u201cCranston\u2019s running another op in town,\u201d he told the other two men before he let that anger take hold. The rest of the accusation he ignored completely.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to get pissed right now. He\u2019d spent a lot of years trapping that emotion so deep inside him that it didn\u2019t burn in his gut anymore. Keeping it there was important. Keeping it there kept breathing certain and Natches\u2019s conscience clear.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that fat little fucker want?\u201d Dawg straightened and glanced toward the hotel with obvious animosity. \u201cIs he in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not yet. Miss Chaya Greta Dane is there right now, and if my guess is right, she\u2019s watching us right now from room three oh four. Do you think maybe she\u2019s figured out we\u2019re onto her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find out?\u201d Rowdy was watching Natches.</p><p>Natches hated it when Rowdy watched him like that. Like he knew something, or saw something Natches didn\u2019t want seen.</p> <p>\u201cAnonymous tip.\u201d Natches grimaced. \u201cAnd that ain\u2019t no joke. A call to my cell phone an hour ago\u2014untraceable so far\u2014letting me know she had hit the county line and was here for DHS. If Cranston\u2019s lost more missiles, boys, I might have to kill him.\u201d</p><p>He was joking. Kind of.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t heard anything.\u201d Dawg rubbed at his clean-shaven jaw as he glanced toward the window of Chaya\u2019s room.</p><p>She liked to go by the name Greta, but hell if that name suited her. With her multihued blond hair and exquisite features, she was as exotic as a tropical flower. Chaya suited her. The name rolled off the tongue, and in the darkest nights, as he jacked off to the image of her in his head, the name sounded like a prayer as he spilled his release into his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not heard anything from my contacts either,\u201d Rowdy murmured. \u201cNot even a whisper that a DHS agent was coming to town.\u201d</p><p>Which meant Cranston was keeping whatever he was up to very close to his chest. And that was a very bad thing. When that rabid little bastard kept his mouth shut, then things were about to get ugly.</p><p>The thought of that had him glancing toward the hotel again. Chaya was a hell of an agent, but her heart wasn\u2019t in it. Natches had seen that the year before. She hadn\u2019t wanted to be in Somerset, and she hadn\u2019t wanted to play Cranston\u2019s games.</p><p>\u201cShe was supposed to have resigned,\u201d he murmured, his eyes narrowing against the bright autumn sunlight overhead. \u201cTurned the papers in just after the op here was what I heard.\u201d</p> <p>He was unaware of the curious looks his cousins gave him. Rowdy glanced at Dawg questioningly, but all his cousin had in reply was a brief shrug.</p><p>Natches never cared enough about anyone except his cousins, their wives, his sister, and Rowdy\u2019s father, Ray, to check up on them over anything. He often claimed when it came to people, he wouldn\u2019t stop the train from wrecking, because it was too damned amusing to sit back and watch the cars piling up.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been nearly so amused by the role Cranston had forced Miss Dane into though. He had placed her in danger, and that had pissed Natches off. Just as Cranston had placed all their asses in the fire.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need from us?\u201d Rowdy turned back to his younger cousin, his chest tightening as it always did whenever he stared at the other man too long.</p><p>Natches was almost cold now. It had been coming for a while, but sometimes he feared that cold had taken full hold of him, and chilled him clear to his soul.</p><p>Natches seemed to shrug at the question, as though he either didn\u2019t care, or wasn\u2019t certain what he needed.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t little Lucy Moore work here?\u201d Dawg asked then. \u201cShe works registration, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Natches nodded at the question. Lucy was a third cousin on his mother\u2019s side, a sweet little girl, but sometimes she was a little too smart for her own good. She had put Chaya in the room he wanted her in, but she had been curious as to why he wanted her there.</p><p>\u201cThen just wait till she leaves and slip into her room. Check her shit out and see if she\u2019s as anal as she used to be with her notes,\u201d Dawg suggested.</p><p>Natches glared at him. \u201cShe\u2019s not stupid, Dawg. Those notes, if she has them, will be locked tight in that laptop and none of us are hackers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlip in and seduce the information out of her.\u201d Dawg grinned at that one. \u201cYou\u2019re good at that shit. Get her to talk, then send her ass home.\u201d</p><p>It was an idea, except he knew something they didn\u2019t know. Chaya didn\u2019t have a home.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is up with this, Natches?\u201d Rowdy questioned him then. \u201cYou knew her before she came here; don\u2019t deny it. Now she\u2019s back with no clear reason why. Maybe she\u2019s back to see you.\u201d</p><p>Natches shook his head slowly. No, she wasn\u2019t back to see him. He came with memories, and Natches knew exactly how that worked. Those memories were too painful, and they were rife with too much emotion for Natches or Chaya to willingly touch them with a ten-foot pole.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here for me,\u201d he finally said, wondering at the regret that pricked at him. \u201cThis is an op, boys. Anonymous call, pretty agent, and no agency gossip. Cranston\u2019s trying to pull something over on us and I want to know what the hell it is.\u201d</p><p>Chaya stared through the filmy curtains at the three men gathered in the parking lot. There weren\u2019t a lot of cars parked out there, and it was as plain as the dark glasses on Natches\u2019s face that they were there because of her.</p><p>For a moment, just a moment, she could hear screams in her head. Desperate, clawing sounds that ricocheted inside her, shredded her hard-won composure and had her swinging away from the sight of Natches to pace through her bedroom.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just her own screams she heard in her head. The feel of flames licking at her, the horror and stench of death poured into her senses and left her shaking.</p><p>She had to swallow tight, clench her fists and force herself away from the memories just as she had to force herself not to return to that window and stare at the men who occasionally glanced up at her room.</p><p>They already knew she was here. So much for the element of surprise where Natches was concerned. She had hoped to surprise him with her appearance, hopefully throw him off balance just a little bit.</p><p>She snorted at that before pacing back to the window, drawn, despite her best efforts, to the sight of him.</p><p>Natches Mackay. He was almost a legend in the Marines. He had been inducted into sniper training right out of boot camp. Within four years he had a kill ratio that made her flinch at the thought of it. Then, in a trick of fate or, as Timothy liked to say, a trick of Natches, a stray bullet had slammed into his shoulder, taking him out of the game.</p><p>For years it was rumored Natches had never regained the ability to handle a sniper rifle again. Last year, they had learned differently. Natches was just as silent, and just as deadly, as he had ever been.</p><p>She flinched as his head turned and he stared back at her. Surely he couldn\u2019t see her behind the filmy curtains, but he knew she was there. He knew which room she was in, and he knew once she saw him out there, she wouldn\u2019t be able to look away.</p><p>\u201cPut your head down! Close your fucking eyes, Chaya. Ah God. Sweet mercy! Don\u2019t look, baby. Don\u2019t look.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. The feel of him lying on her, holding her down despite her struggles, her screams, still brought her awake at night.</p><p>Very few people in the world knew that she and Natches had a history. She prayed that only she and Natches knew, because if Timothy had managed to find out exactly what happened before she came to DHS, then he would never let her go. And he would have the edge he needed to pull Natches into Homeland Security rather than merely using the Mackay cousins as contract agents whenever he could manage to trick them into it.</p><p>She opened her eyes and stared out the window again, those dark glasses shielding his eyes, his too-long black hair pulled back at the nape of his neck, the savagery of his features more pronounced than it had been the year before.</p><p>He always looked like a dark avenging angel to her. But now, he looked like a savage warrior. She knew if he pulled those glasses off the forest green eyes would be piercing, dark, and filled with knowledge and anger.</p><p>So much anger. And she couldn\u2019t blame him. Not in the least.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done it this time, Chaya,\u201d she murmured into the silence of the room.</p><p>And she had. She had allowed her boss to blackmail her into another mission that threw her directly in Natches\u2019s path. Big mistake. Very big mistake.</p><p>Rowdy strode into the upstairs office of Mackay Lumber and Building Supplies and glared at Dawg as his cousin pulled a beer from the fridge and threw himself in the big leather chair behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to let me in on the secret,\u201d he snapped as he slammed the door closed. \u201cWhat the hell is going on? Or has gone on?\u201d</p><p>Dawg slouched back in the chair and tipped the beer to his lips thoughtfully. A long drink later he sat the bottle on the desk and stared back at Rowdy.</p><p>\u201cNow see, I was hoping you would have the answers to those questions.\u201d He wiped his hand over his jaw before shaking his head in obvious confusion. \u201cHe was actin\u2019 stranger than hell with her last year. Every time he got around her he was pokin\u2019 at her or watching her. Don\u2019t you think she\u2019s a little plain for him?\u201d</p><p>Rowdy moved to one of the comfortable leather chairs across from the desk and lowered himself into it as he considered Dawg\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cShe has pretty hair.\u201d He finally shrugged, his expression creasing into male contemplation.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s homely,\u201d Dawg grunted.</p><p>Rowdy snorted at that. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying that about every woman we\u2019ve come across since Kelly and Crista got their hooks in us. Admit it, Dawg; we\u2019re prejudiced.\u201d</p><p>Dawg glared. \u201cI know a pretty woman when I see one. Just because you\u2019re blind as a bat doesn\u2019t mean I am.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy shook his head. \u201cShe looks okay, I guess. Can\u2019t tell much with those loose clothes and the way she scrapes her hair back from her face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe smokes.\u201d Dawg tapped the desk with his fingers, his expression worried.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nitpicking. What\u2019s the real problem, Dawg?\u201d Rowdy leaned forward, watching his cousin carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you to nitpick.\u201d</p><p>Dawg\u2019s lips tightened, then pursed thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cNatches brought a woman out of the Iraqi desert with him on that last six-week mission he took. You know he was always goin\u2019 off on a hit and taking his good ole easy time loping back to extraction so he could spy a little on the enemy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rowdy nodded.</p><p>\u201cWord got around. Natches managed to hook up with an Army Intelligence agent. Female. Beaten, tortured. He pulled her out and the extraction team picked them both up. After that, no one\u2019s talkin\u2019. Something happened after that, Rowdy. Something that made Natches darker than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFemale agent, beaten and tortured.\u201d Rowdy frowned. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have time to break his heart, Dawg. A lot of shit happened to all of us in the Marines. That wasn\u2019t a pleasant place to be.\u201d</p><p>Dawg shook his head. \u201cNo. Something bad happened out there that Natches doesn\u2019t talk about, and I think she was there. Natches knew her the minute we met the team Cranston brought in last year. That night he went on a drunk like I ain\u2019t seen since he busted up his daddy\u2019s restaurant for him.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy leaned back in his chair and grimaced at that information. He hadn\u2019t been a part of that mission. His damned cousins seemed to think he needed a vacation after dealing with the serial killer who had tried to kill his wife.</p><p>But Dawg was right, something had changed in Natches last year, something that had bothered both of them for a year now.</p><p>\u201cIs he in love with her?\u201d Rowdy mused.</p><p>It was damned hard to imagine Natches in love with any one woman. He seemed to like them all equally. But there had been something different about how he acted last year outside the spa in town.</p><p>Dawg and Rowdy had met with Natches there, while Kelly and Crista went in for their woman stuff. They hadn\u2019t felt secure enough to leave the women unguarded. And Greta Dane\u2014no, Chaya, Natches had told them her name was really Chaya\u2014had been there following Dawg and Crista.</p><p>Natches hadn\u2019t been able to stay away from her and neither of them acted just normal around each other.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on an op,\u201d Dawg muttered. \u201cI can feel it. Something\u2019s getting ready to go down and she\u2019s going to pull him into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d They didn\u2019t need that. Rowdy knew Natches. His cousin could be as impulsive as hell, and he rarely thought to cover his own damned ass until it was too late.</p><p>Rowdy pushed himself to his feet and paced the interior of the office. He knew the operation that had played out the year before and it still kept him awake at night.</p><p>\u201cWhat was left untied?\u201d He turned to Dawg. \u201cThe operation last year, the money Johnny got as a down payment on the missiles, was it found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hardly,\u201d Dawg grunted. \u201cCranston was pulling his hair out by the roots when it didn\u2019t show up.\u201d</p><p>Timothy Cranston, that rabid little bastard of an agent in charge. He should be shot with his own gun. Rowdy had had the extreme displeasure of meeting him several times. He still didn\u2019t like him.</p><p>\u201cWho else would have helped Johnny, Dawg?\u201d Rowdy asked then, his voice heavy, his chest still tightening, even after all this time.</p><p>Johnny had been their cousin, and he had used them all. He would have killed them all if he could have. He had definitely planned to kill Dawg\u2019s wife, Crista. Him and his lover, Jim Bedsford.</p><p>\u201cThey picked up the team Johnny used to steal the missiles,\u201d Dawg said. \u201cJohnny and Bedsford are dead, and only they knew where the million in down payment was hidden. Hell, what\u2019s left to find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve missed something,\u201d Rowdy suggested then.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell could we have missed?\u201d Dawg cursed. \u201cHis agent is back and Natches gets an anonymous call informing him of that fact? Doesn\u2019t make sense, Rowdy. If the girl came back to get hot and sweaty with Natches, why the call?\u201d</p><p>Rowdy frowned at that. If it hadn\u2019t been for the phone call, he\u2019d have assumed that getting hot and sweaty was exactly what was on Miss Dane\u2019s mind. But why would someone call and warn him?</p> <p>Rowdy felt the hairs at the back of his neck lift in warning, and he rubbed at them in irritation.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s my answer, too,\u201d Dawg admitted. \u201cMy neck is tingling like hell. Something\u2019s getting ready to go down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Agent Dane is putting Natches right square in the middle of it,\u201d Rowdy realized. \u201cSo we cover him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd cause him to shoot us?\u201d Dawg snarled in disbelieving amazement. \u201cYou know how much he likes shadows, Rowdy. We try to cover him and he\u2019ll try to kick our asses.\u201d</p><p>That left one last option. \u201cI have some contacts I can call on.\u201d Rowdy was pulling the names up in his head as he spoke. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can find out.\u201d</p><p>Dawg nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll do the same on my end. Call some of the old agents from last year\u2019s op and see what they have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to watch out for Natches,\u201d Rowdy insisted. \u201cAt least check up on him.\u201d</p><p>Dawg stared at him askance. \u201cFine, you do it. You\u2019ve had Kelly longer than I\u2019ve been with Crista. I kind of like my body in working order right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both.\u201d</p><p>Dawg breathed out roughly. \u201cFlip for it or take turns?\u201d</p><p>Rowdy dropped back in the chair. \u201cI guess take turns.\u201d He was imagining the pain once Natches caught them. He was hell in a fight, and he would definitely fight.</p><p>Dawg slunk down farther in his chair. \u201cI should kill Cranston.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy grunted. \u201cGive Natches time; he\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d</p><p>And that was what they were both afraid of.</p><p>TWO</p><p>The next morning Chaya met with the team that had been pulled in to work the investigation Cranston had managed to get operational status for.</p><p>The six men were older, late thirties to early forties, and would blend in well. Their various covers worked for the area and would provide rationale for their seeming nosiness.</p><p>That would work in her favor, Chaya thought as she headed back to her room after the first, early morning meeting. They would gather bits and pieces of the gossip drifting around about the events of last year, and then Cranston could begin a list of persons of interest and the questions Chaya would ask.</p><p>They were working in the blind though, and she knew it. The problem was they had been working in the blind for five years. It had to end here. She just couldn\u2019t do this much longer. The reason she was back this time was Cranston\u2019s bribes. Her resignation was still awaiting the stamp of approval.</p><p>Gritting her teeth at the thought of Cranston dragging his feet on her resignation, she swiped her key card through the security pad and waited for the light to flicker to green before pushing the door open and stepping through.</p><p>She allowed the door to close slowly behind her. She shrugged her jacket from her shoulders, unclipped the holstered weapon she carried just behind her hip and smoothed her free hand down the side of her skirt. She wished she had worn jeans.</p><p>She dropped the jacket and weapon on the table, just inside the small suite, then turned and moved for the bedroom. The door was open, and when she stepped inside, she felt her heart catch in her throat.</p><p>Natches.</p><p>She swallowed tightly as she caught sight of him, sprawled out in the easy chair by the window, long jean-clad legs stretched out before him as his hand lifted.</p><p>She felt the flush that suffused her features as she saw the heavy, latex vibrator in his hand. The molded penis was her toy of choice, especially when visions of this man drove her crazy with need.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t managed to get over him, no matter how hard she tried.</p><p>Swallowing tightly she watched as he tilted the erotic toy toward his face and inhaled slowly.</p><p>She swore her knees nearly went out from beneath her, and arousal, sharp and hot, shot through her core.</p><p>\u201cYou amaze me,\u201d he said then, reaching out to lay the toy on her pillow. That wasn\u2019t where he had gotten it from. \u201cYou bring a toy to do a man\u2019s job, knowing the man is more than willing to provide the service. Where does that make sense, Chay?\u201d</p><p>She braced one hand on her hip, the other on the doorframe and stared back at him, forcing her features to bland interest even though she knew she was eating him with her eyes.</p><p>\u201cConsidering the fact that the man offering comes with strings, I decided it was the safer option.\u201d</p><p>He would always demand more from a woman than was comfortable. More than Chaya had been able to consider in the past years.</p><p>He chuckled at that, his forest green eyes roving over her, taking in the skirt, the silk shell she had worn beneath her blazer, and the pumps on her feet.</p><p>Maybe she should have worn stockings rather than panty hose? She had a feeling he knew exactly what she had on beneath her skirt.</p><p>\u201cEverything in life comes with strings, darlin\u2019.\u201d He shrugged and looked entirely too comfortable in that chair.</p><p>Shaking her head, Chaya stalked across the room, not thinking\u2014she never thought when it came to Natches\u2014to jerk the incriminating dildo from her pillow.</p><p>\u201cOh, you didn\u2019t do that.\u201d He laughed. It was the only warning she had before he was behind her, one arm going around her waist, the other catching her wrist and the toy as he rolled her to her back.</p><p>Her little screech didn\u2019t even slow him down. His legs trapped hers as he came over her, and he ignored her hands as she pushed at his hard stomach.</p><p>She could have made him let her go. She knew how. But God, she couldn\u2019t consider it. Besides the fact he would find a way to block her, she had no doubt in her mind that he would come up with a way to make certain she regretted it.</p><p>\u201cThese games are beneath you, Natches,\u201d she snapped, wishing she didn\u2019t sound so breathless.</p><p>\u201cNo, the games aren\u2019t, but you are.\u201d His brows arched, a smile curved his lips and humor flashed with suspicion in his gaze. A gaze turning hot with arousal as she glimpsed the thick wedge at the front of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Natches.\u201d</p><p>He lifted the dildo and stared down at her. \u201cHow do you use it?\u201d</p><p>Her flush became hotter. \u201cDuh. Figure it out.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer, his lips turning into a wicked smile now. \u201cDo you suck it first? Do you taste yourself on it and remember how much I loved going down on you and tasting all that hot cream?\u201d</p><p>That hot cream as he called it was flooding her vagina, saturating her panties. Was there anything more wicked than this man? Anything that tempted her past her pain more than he did?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d she whispered, weak now. She could feel the weakness flooding her, the need. The need that had forced her to use that toy just that morning.</p><p>\u201cWhen you suck it, do you think of me?\u201d</p><p>She fought to breathe as he brushed the head of the toy over her cheek.</p><p>\u201cLet me watch you use it.\u201d</p><p>Shock rounded her eyes, had her fighting to swallow.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Because the minute it sinks past those pretty pink lips I\u2019m going to remember the feel of your mouth on my dick. I might come in my jeans. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever done that.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was going to beat out of her chest. Her breasts were swollen and sensitive now, the nipples pressing hard into her bra and the thin material of the top.</p><p>\u201cCome on; let me see.\u201d He smiled, so wicked, so erotic, as he brushed it against her lips. \u201cLet me see and remember, Chay. Just for a minute.\u201d</p><p>She knew better. She had known better than to return to Somerset. The minute she did, she knew exactly what Natches was going to do: He would destroy her with her own desires.</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>A tight, erotic grimace contorted his lips as he stared down at her, at the toy within touching distance of her lips, and sparks of anger filled his gaze.</p><p>The next second it was his tongue filling her mouth. His lips covering hers. She didn\u2019t know what he did with the toy; she didn\u2019t care. He was kissing her again. He was possessing her lips, eating at them, and she was eating back.</p><p>He always tasted so good, so dark and male. Her arms wrapped around his neck, her fingers spearing into his hair as she felt him jerking her skirt over her thighs, his fingers pressing her legs apart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was going to take her. She could feel it. She wasn\u2019t going to escape this time. Last year he had been kind, even for him, and let her go. This time, he wasn\u2019t letting her go.</p><p>\u201cNatches.\u201d She breathed his name out in protest as he tore his lips from hers, pressed kisses along her neck, moved to the heaving mounds of her breasts.</p><p>Her nipples ached for him. For his mouth, his tongue.</p> <p>\u201cI should spank you,\u201d he growled. \u201cDamn you, Chay. You knew better than to come back here. I know you did.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she had, and she\u2019d had no choice but to return. But she would have anyway. She knew she would have, because the fight to stay away from him had been too hard. It had been more than she could bear.</p><p>One more assignment. Just this last operation and then\u2014they would have time then. Not now.</p><p>She shook her head as she arched to him. Now wasn\u2019t the time. She couldn\u2019t divide her attention like this. She would end up getting killed.</p><p>His mouth buried between her breasts, his tongue licking, stroking as she moaned his name. She needed. Just one more taste of him, then she would be strong.</p> <p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d Suddenly, his head jerked up. \u201cWhy are you here, Chay?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She wasn\u2019t drawing him in to this. It wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>\u201cJust questions,\u201d she panted. \u201cFollow-up. I have to follow up.\u201d</p><p>She was going to have to do some heavy talking if he ever found out where those questions would lead.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d The accusation was soft, wickedly knowing. \u201cYou can\u2019t lie to me, Chay.\u201d</p><p>He pressed her legs apart with his and the toy; he still had that damned toy. He stroked it over the damp cotton that shielded her from him.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s play a game,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI ask a question, you tell the truth, and I give you something you\u2019ll really like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me, Natches.\u201d</p><p>As he had once bragged, his kisses were potent.</p><p>He leaned forward, brushed his lips against hers.</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d he asked softly, his eyes knowing.</p><p>\u201cLet me get drunk on you,\u201d she urged. \u201cJust kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust kiss you?\u201d The head of the toy pressed more firmly against her hungry core. \u201cBut, Chay, you\u2019re so wet and so wild beneath me. Let\u2019s play my little game first.\u201d</p><p>She arched and cried out as he pulled back.</p> <p>\u201cFirst question.\u201d He licked over the top of a breast revealed by the material he nudged lower with his chin. \u201cDid DHS send you here?\u201d</p><p>Okay, that one was easy.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered carefully.</p><p>A soft approving murmur against the curve of her breast and he was nudging the cup of her bra lower to lick at her nipple. Heat sizzled in her veins and sent her hips thrusting, grinding against the toy he held pressed to her panties.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAm I involved?\u201d</p><p>Was he? She didn\u2019t think he was. He shouldn\u2019t be. She could be honest there.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She lifted her hips again, wanting more. Damn him, she was honest. Reward time here.</p><p>He nipped at her nipple and nearly sent her into orgasm.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted to answer, to spill her guts just for another taste of the pleasure he could give her.</p><p>\u201cFollow-up.\u201d She moaned.</p><p>\u201cHmm, Chay, my little liar.\u201d He pulled the toy back. \u201cCome on, baby; fess up.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes opened as she stared back at him, aching, hurting for him.</p><p>\u201cFollow-up,\u201d she repeated, the tormented whisper dragged from her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m here.\u201d And it was partially the truth. Enough of the truth, and all he needed to stay safe.</p><p>He knelt above her. She watched hungrily as, tossing the toy aside, he loosened his belt, unsnapped his jeans, then lowered the zipper slowly. She licked her lips, her hands poised to help him, to catch the heavy length of his erection when it was free. To taste it. To fill her mouth with it.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Chay?\u201d She barely missed the hardening of his voice.</p><p>\u201cFollow-up.\u201d She felt dazed, off balance, impatient. Like an addict anticipating a fix.</p><p>And just that fast he rolled away from her, moved to his feet, and was fixing his jeans, his expression still, silent with anger.</p><p>Damn. There went the fix. Her body was screaming out in protest, reminding her how mean she was being to it. How long had it been now since she had known his possession? Five years, two months, three days, and how many hours, she thought morosely.</p><p>\u201cI guess that means I don\u2019t get any more rewards.\u201d She sighed as she adjusted her skirt and top. She didn\u2019t bother to roll from the bed. \u201cLock the door behind you if you don\u2019t mind. I may need some privacy after you leave.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her. The next thing she knew, the thin cord was jerked from the base of the dildo and as she watched in horror, he tore it in half.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. Natches, you didn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need privacy, then by God you can make do with your fingers. That\u2019s what you\u2019ve reduced me to.\u201d He tossed the pieces to the floor. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to tell me the fucking truth, you know where to find me.\u201d</p><p>With that, he stalked out of the room. She stared at the floor in disbelief then at the door as the echo of the main door slamming penetrated her mind.</p><p>He broke her toy and left?</p><p>She was going to kill him.</p><p>THREE</p><p>Somerset and Lake Cumberland appealed to Chaya in a way that had surprised her. Arriving ahead of the Homeland Security team, in advance preparation more than a year ago, she had been taken aback by the friendliness of the citizens and the relaxed, peaceful atmosphere of the mountains surrounding the town.</p><p>There was serenity here. Not that there wasn\u2019t crime, or criminals, of course. The theft and attempted sale of the missiles last year was proof enough. No, it was something else. There was a quiet, easygoing feel to the area, and she had loved it.</p><p>She had missed it since the team had left last year. She had missed the community, and she had missed Natches. Unfortunately, she had missed Natches more than anything else.</p><p>And Timothy had known Natches was her weakness. That was the problem with having a boss as manipulating and calculating as Timothy Cranston. He knew the agents under him to their back teeth. Their strengths and their weaknesses. And he didn\u2019t have a problem using both to his advantage.</p><p>Hell, she was supposed to be out of this. Right now, she should have been apartment hunting or something. She should have been getting her head straight, because it was something she hadn\u2019t managed to do in five years.</p><p>She had managed to quit smoking again. It was a nasty habit, and breaking it hadn\u2019t been easy. Timothy alone was an excuse to smoke. She bet half of his agents had picked up the habit only after having been assigned to his team.</p><p>This operation had obsessed Cranston though, worse than Chaya had ever seen him obsessed. Those missiles in the wrong hands would have been disastrous. And knowing that it had been Americans behind the hijacking and attempted sale had enraged Cranston. Finding out it had a connection to a much older investigation had made him rabid. They were so close he claimed, so close to finding the bastards he spent every waking moment of his life chasing.</p><p>He had pulled every string he could find and had broken more than one rule in that investigation last year. One of those strings was pulling in two ex-Marines onto the team. Locals known for their wild reputations and their ability to gather and filter local gossip. Dawg and Natches Mackay. And there had been the added benefit for Timothy of finally finding Natches Mackay\u2019s \u201cweakness\u201d as he called it.</p><p>And that one she had to roll her eyes at. She was anything but his weakness. Natches wanted her. He would spend the night in her bed in a heartbeat and she knew it. She could have him. On his terms and by his rules. And that would mean dragging him into an investigation he had no business being a part of. That, she couldn\u2019t find it within herself to do.</p><p>As she pulled her rental car into the parking lot of the local diner that the Mackay men were known to frequent, Chaya checked her weapon and breathed out a sigh of frustration.</p><p>She hated this. Hated the deception and the need for it. And even more, she hated being under Natches\u2019s radar once again. Especially after he broke her toy. And here she was on assignment. It wasn\u2019t as though she could just go out and buy a new one.</p><p>She checked her rearview mirror and there he was. That wicked black jeep pulling into the back entrance and stopping, the man behind the wheel watching her from behind dark glasses.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t approached her since he had stomped from her hotel room days before. But he had been following her since she left the hotel that morning. He had hung back, stayed distant just as he had the year before. He just watched, and just made her as nervous as hell.</p><p>Parking the sedan, Chaya gathered her purse and the heavy file she\u2019d brought with her before stepping out into the crisp autumn air.</p><p>She could feel his eyes on her back as she moved to the entrance of the diner. Intense, blazing. The feminine core of her had been reawakened by that look over a year ago, and now, after knowing his touch again, it didn\u2019t seem inclined to go back to sleep.</p><p>She pushed her way into the diner and stood for a moment, getting her bearings as all eyes turned to her. Suspicious, curious, amused. She latched onto the amused gaze of Sheriff Ezekiel Mayes before striding across the large room.</p><p>His hawklike eyes followed her progress through the room as he rose slowly to his feet. The dun-colored sheriff\u2019s uniform showed off a body in peak condition for a man of thirty-six years. Dark brown hair was military short and emphasized the strong planes and angles of his masculine face.</p><p>\u201cAgent Dane.\u201d He nodded as she took her seat and laid the heavy file on the table in front of her, then he returned to his seat.</p><p>\u201cThank you for agreeing to meet with me, Sheriff.\u201d She tried out her best business smile, but at the narrowing of his eyes, she assumed it hadn\u2019t gone off quite as planned. \u201cI know it was short notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything less.\u201d He picked up his coffee and took a drink before setting the cup on the table and motioning to the waitress as she moved by. \u201cBecca, we\u2019ll need more coffee over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha, Zeke.\u201d The waitress gave Chaya a quick, suspicious look before moving away.</p><p>\u201cHave you had lunch yet?\u201d he asked Chaya then.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I just have some questions I needed to ask and a few things I\u2019d like to go over with you before we head out to begin these interviews.\u201d</p><p>Why Timothy had arranged for this sheriff to tag along with her she wasn\u2019t certain. Ezekiel Mayes was nobody\u2019s fool. He\u2019d spent five years as a homicide detective in Los Angeles before returning to his hometown and running for sheriff. He was suspicious by nature, perceptive, and when he had learned an operation had been conducted without his knowledge by the DHS last year, he had been in D.C. screaming in the faces of men with enough power to scald Cranston\u2019s ass.</p><p>Mayes had some small amount of pull there, Cranston had learned, and he knew exactly how to wield it. Proof was in the fact that she was working with him now.</p><p>Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive. The quote whispered through Chaya\u2019s mind, and not for the first time. Cranston was playing a very dangerous game here, and Sheriff Mayes was but one of the potential enemies that he could make.</p><p>\u201cCoffee, Zeke.\u201d Becca, the waitress, set the cup down before turning to Chaya. \u201cYou need anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d She shook her head, wishing she could find a way to still the nerves in her stomach as she lifted the coffee to her lips.</p><p>Becca nodded and moved off, but the sheriff\u2019s gaze never left Chaya.</p><p>\u201cCranston\u2019s sunk to a new low.\u201d Mayes leaned back in his chair and regarded her with sharp golden brown eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCranston\u2019s always finding new lows.\u201d Chaya shrugged. \u201cWhat has he managed to do this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sent a pretty little girl to do a man\u2019s job.\u201d He grunted in disgust. \u201cThe Mackays are none too happy with DHS right now, and neither is the local law enforcement around here. You don\u2019t pull an op like you did last year and not inform the locals without stepping on some toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t required to inform anyone of our operation here. We were required to reacquire those missiles, Sheriff, not make nice with the local law enforcement. And my gender has nothing to do with my ability to conduct this end of the investigation.\u201d</p> <p>He grunted at that. \u201cYeah, two years in military intelligence and five with DHS. You have a hell of a record under your belt, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She did, and it was one she was proud of, sometimes, she assured herself. When she needed something to find a source of pride in, then it worked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a green agent, Sheriff.\u201d She leaned back in her own chair and stared back at him. \u201cNor am I out of my element here. You have enough pull that you were able to make certain you were contacted and included in any further investigations. I\u2019m fine with that. But you don\u2019t have the power to give me orders or to direct these interviews. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>His gaze flared with anger for a moment, then the amusement was back. \u201cJust your little lackey, huh?\u201d he murmured, glancing over his shoulder at the sound of the bell over the door tinkling merrily to announce another customer.</p><p>Chaya sighed. It was Natches. She could feel him now.</p> <p>\u201cShall we get down to business?\u201d She picked up the list of interviewees that she had chosen to visit that afternoon. \u201cHere\u2019s the short list of people I need to see today. I assume we can have this completed before too late tonight.\u201d</p><p>Mayes took the list and studied it with a frown. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the full list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not required to give you the full list,\u201d she told him, feeling Natches moving in closer, hearing him as a chair scraped across the floor just behind her.</p><p>The sheriff\u2019s lips twitched as he continued to study her.</p><p>\u201cYou like to live dangerously, don\u2019t you, little girl?\u201d</p><p>She barely contained her flinch. She had heard those words before, and the hell she had lived through afterward still haunted her nightmares.</p> <p>\u201cI live as I must.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cAnother of those details that I\u2019m not required to discuss with you. Now, as you are the first on my list to be interviewed, shall we get started?\u201d</p><p>There was a snort of a laugh behind her. The sound had her hackles rising and a curl of anger prickling inside.</p><p>Before Mayes could answer, she turned slowly in her chair and looked back at Natches. He was no more than four feet away from her, staring at her from behind those dark glasses.</p><p>\u201cYour presence really isn\u2019t required at this time,\u201d she told him quietly. \u201cYour turn will come.\u201d</p><p>She refused to let him intimidate her. If he managed to throw her off balance now, then she was lost. She would never be able to complete her assignment as needed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t smile; he didn\u2019t speak. He just stared at her until she turned her back on him again and shuffled through the papers in her files for the information she had tagged regarding the sheriff.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been sheriff for how long now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost six years.\u201d Mayes was definitely amused now. \u201cThey voted me back in for some reason. Personally, I think folks around here consider me a bit of an easy mark, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>That was definitely a jibe at the man behind her. Chaya was well aware of the fact that the sheriff and the Mackays had gone head-to-head several times last year over Dawg Mackay\u2019s activities.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know the reasons why.\u201d She smiled tightly. \u201cJohnny Grace was a popular citizen in town though. You had known him for a while?\u201d</p><p>Mayes nodded slowly. \u201cI\u2019d known him all his life, Agent Dane. I only spent eight years away from home, not a lifetime. Johnny and his parents are well-known to most people in Somerset and the surrounding towns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you had no suspicion he could have been involved in the hijacking of the missiles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose missiles were taken in another county, close to an Army base.\u201d His voice was clipped now. \u201cI had my eyes open for them, but there were those who neglected to inform me that they could be in my county.\u201d And that was a jibe at Chaya and DHS.</p><p>He was professional enough that his animosity didn\u2019t show, but she could feel it.</p><p>\u201cSheriff, I\u2019m not your enemy, nor was I the head agent in that investigation. You\u2019re snapping at the wrong agent here,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI want to complete this and head home as quickly as you want me out of your county.\u201d</p><p>Mayes tilted his head to the side. \u201cNow, what would make you think I want you out of my county? Unlike most people, Agent Dane, I enjoy a good comedy every now and then. And this situation appears to at least have an element of amusement within it.\u201d</p><p>The bell tinkled at the door again. When Chaya lifted her head to glance at the mirror placed next to the register behind Sheriff Mayes, she felt like cursing.</p><p>The Mackays were amassing. The tall, broad forms of Dawg and Rowdy Mackay were reflected in the glass as they moved across the room. They all but swaggered. Dressed in jeans and light T-shirts, Dawg wore a denim jacket, Rowdy wore a leather jacket. Both were suspicious and more than a little intimidating as they joined Natches at his table.</p><p>When her eyes met Sheriff Mayes\u2019s again, the amusement in them had thickened.</p><p>\u201cWhat about known associates of Grace\u2019s?\u201d she asked him then, lowering her voice further. \u201cDid you have any reason to suspect them after the operation completed last year?\u201d</p><p>This was the wrong damned place for these questions. She knew it, and she could see the knowledge of it in Mayes\u2019s eyes. She had tried to warn Timothy, several times, this man was no one\u2019s fool. Timothy had arranged this meeting here specifically to allow Mackay involvement.</p><p>The sheriff leaned closer. Bracing his arms on the table, he stared back at her warningly.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to finish this here, Agent Dane?\u201d he asked her, his voice official, cool.</p><p>\u201cThis is as good a place as any, Sheriff. If you could answer the question please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have reason to suspect half the county then,\u201d he told her. \u201cIf you want to discuss specific suspects though, we\u2019re going to do it elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>That was good enough. That was the best answer she would get right here and now\u2014that Mayes did suspect various parts of the Grace and/or Mackay family. She had spent most of her life learning how to read people, and despite the chill in the sheriff\u2019s face, she could read that much in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAt the time of the operation were you aware that Natches and James Mackay were involved in the operation?\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Mayes snorted at that question. \u201cIf there\u2019s trouble to be found, then James Dawg Mackay and his two cousins are always bound to be close by.\u201d He flicked a mocking look behind her shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019re trouble like that. You\u2019d do well to remember it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t answer the question,\u201d she reminded him softly.</p><p>\u201cI suspected they were in up to their necks in something, I just didn\u2019t know what.\u201d He shrugged easily. \u201cRemember? No one informed me anything was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you knew enough to begin your own investigation and to contact several members of the FBI as well as a contact you made within DHS and the Department of Justice?\u201d</p><p>She handed him the memos that had made it into Timothy\u2019s hands. The sheriff\u2019s phone records clearly revealed the calls that were made, but not which agents took those calls.</p><p>His lips tipped knowingly. \u201cI\u2019m a suspicious bastard; what can I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who did you speak to at that time?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that. \u201cNames elude me, Miss Dane. I just asked to speak to an agent, and they plugged me into someone.\u201d</p><p>Chaya stared back at him suspiciously. He wasn\u2019t even bothering to disguise the fact that he was lying to her.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did they tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey told me to mind my own business in my own little corner of the world,\u201d he continued to lie. \u201cWhat were they supposed to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Chaya held back her own grin though she inclined her head in acknowledgment. Truth be told, she didn\u2019t want to know his contacts and she didn\u2019t give a damn. Timothy was dying to get his little hooks into them though.</p><p>Behind her, silence reigned.</p><p>\u201cOne last question, Sheriff. Can I trust you?\u201d she asked, allowing her own suspicions to enter her voice now. He was a friend of the Mackays; the people of Somerset were his people. She needed to know, to watch his eyes, hear his voice, to determine how far she was going to trust him.</p><p>His eyes narrowed on her again before he leaned forward carefully. \u201cAgent Dane, I\u2019m a duly sworn officer of the law, and this is my home. You can trust me to cover your back. You can trust me to make damned sure any suspicions you have are held in confidence. I might not like what you are or what your team did here last year, but I don\u2019t have to like you to do my job. Are we clear on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd should friends of yours question you regarding the interviews we\u2019re about to make? Will your loyalties then be torn? Because I have to ask you to step aside if they will be. I can bring in another agent to provide backup.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, his jaw clenching. He knew the out she was offering him, and it was one Cranston hadn\u2019t approved. There was no reason to drive a wedge between this man and the Mackays. It was his choice. And she would leave it up to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insulting me,\u201d he bit out. \u201cAnd pissing me off at the same time. I just told you my loyalty is to the law. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d She closed the file and flashed him a cool smile. \u201cShall we go then? I\u2019d like to start with the first name below yours on that list if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened, but he jerked his hat from the side of the table and slammed it on his head before rising to his feet.</p><p>Chaya gathered her file together, looped the strap of her purse over her shoulder then turned to face three sets of Mackay eyes on her.</p><p>Light green, emerald green, and behind dark glasses she knew were the deepest, darkest forest green eyes she had ever seen. They mesmerized, sank into the soul and left their impression forever after.</p><p>\u201cIt was good to see you boys again.\u201d She smiled tightly. \u201cMaybe next time we\u2019ll have a chance to chat for a while.\u201d</p><p>Dawg and Rowdy ducked their heads, but Natches\u2019s expression never shifted, his eyes never left hers.</p><p>\u201cGreta, you don\u2019t want to be here,\u201d Dawg finally muttered as his head lifted, his expression concerned. \u201cLet this go. Make Cranston send someone else to do his dirty work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Dawg, you know how convincing he can be,\u201d she reminded him mockingly. \u201cI think you and I both know I\u2019m rather stuck here. And I do have a job to do. Good day.\u201d</p><p>She nodded to them, then moved past the sheriff, who had stood back, watching the confrontation. Natches\u2019s eyes still followed her, silent, aware.</p><p>Did the memories bring him awake at night in a cold sweat? she wondered. Did he even let himself remember?</p><p>She tried not to remember, but she did. Too often . . . Remembering was a weakness, because each time she allowed herself to remember hell, then she was also reminded of ecstasy. And she wondered if hell wasn\u2019t safer.</p><p>\u201cYou want to tell us what\u2019s doin\u2019, bro?\u201d Dawg stared across the table at Natches as he sipped at the coffee he\u2019d finally ordered.</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019s doin\u2019,\u201d he replied, flicking his cousin a mocking look. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTake the glasses off, Natches,\u201d Rowdy finally bit out.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t dare. He\u2019d been out of the game too long. His eyes showed what he knew his face didn\u2019t, and when it came to Chaya, they showed even more.</p><p>There were secrets he kept, secrets he was determined to keep. And Chaya was one of them.</p> <p>\u201cI have you, Chay. Hold on, baby. Just hold on. I have you.\u201d</p><p>He almost flinched at the memory. The smell of gunfire, of violence and blood, filled his head, and the sounds of her screams. Screams so horrifying, so filled with rage and pain that he hadn\u2019t known how to live with them in his head.</p><p>\u201cI need to roll.\u201d He pushed the coffee cup back and dug into his jeans for a few dollars to pay the bill.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to fuck around here. Chaya and Zeke were on the move, and Natches was very curious as to the names on that list she had shown the sheriff.</p><p>He was very damned curious as to why she was here to begin with. He had the official line. He had the rumors and he had the suppositions his contacts had come up with. None of those satisfied him. None of those reasons kept his hackles from rising every time he thought about it, or every time he saw Chaya.</p> <p>He tossed the money on the table and started to rise.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to make a mess of this diner, cuz,\u201d Dawg said then. \u201cAnd if we fight, you know there\u2019s gonna be a mess. Sit your ass down here and tell us what the hell is going on. Let us help you, Natches.\u201d</p><p>He stared back at Dawg, then Rowdy. He could see the concern in their eyes, the worry that he was riding that line again. He had ridden that line a lot in the past. The one that separated common sense from pure, bloody violence.</p><p>What the hell was wrong with him? He couldn\u2019t make sense of it. He hadn\u2019t made sense of it in seven years and it still didn\u2019t make sense. When Chaya was anywhere near, he didn\u2019t know himself. He didn\u2019t know who he was and he didn\u2019t understand the needs that tore through him, nor did he understand the extreme possessiveness.</p><p>In one hot afternoon in the Iraqi desert while he waited for the calvary to ride in and listened to the enemy get closer, he had found something he hadn\u2019t expected to find.</p><p>There, buried in a hole, he had held a woman, and somehow that woman had slipped inside his soul.</p> <p>How did that happen? In such a short time, how did one woman change everything a man knew about himself?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m married.\u201d She had whispered the words, and they had been filled with pain, with a knowledge he couldn\u2019t have guessed at, at the time.</p><p>And what had shocked him clear to the bottom of his soul was that it hadn\u2019t mattered. As he held her, he\u2019d known that marriage wasn\u2019t going to stand in his way. She was his, and that feeling had seared his soul.</p><p>And he had found a core of possessiveness that he hadn\u2019t imagined lived inside him. That possessiveness had shocked him clear to the center of his being, and still had the power to throw him off balance.</p><p>\u201cNatches.\u201d Rowdy\u2019s voice was warning. \u201cDon\u2019t walk out that fucking door.\u201d</p><p>Natches shook his head and followed the woman he couldn\u2019t stay away from. He had to follow her. He had to know what the hell she was doing and how much danger it was going to place her in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I have you, baby.\u201d</p><p>He held her as she sobbed. Broken, horrific cries that ripped at his guts and flayed his soul as he carried her through hell. The smell of blood and death and broken dreams surrounded them, and all he could do was hold her.</p> <p>As he left the diner he didn\u2019t feel the late autumn air, he felt the heat of an Iraqi summer, the sun blazing down on Baghdad as fire blazed at their backs. He didn\u2019t hear the traffic around him, or Dawg\u2019s voice behind him. He heard her screams. He heard her pleas as she begged him, pleaded with him to let her die, too.</p><p>\u201cNatches, enough of this shit!\u201d Dawg and Rowdy caught him as he neared his jeep, gripping his arm and swinging him around. \u201cDamn it, what the hell is going on with you? You\u2019re starting to worry us, man.\u201d</p><p>They were defensive, ducking instinctively, knowing his habit of swinging first and asking questions later. But Natches didn\u2019t swing.</p><p>He knew these two men. Knew them almost as well as he knew himself, and he knew they wouldn\u2019t let it go.</p><p>Shaking his head he pulled the glasses from his face and stared back at them. And he knew what they saw. Both men stepped back, staring back at him in surprise. He saw those eyes in the mirror every morning since Chaya\u2019s return last year, and he saw his inability to control the need riding him more every day.</p><p>\u201cMy fight,\u201d he told them both. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for all of us here. I guess I finally grew up, huh?\u201d</p><p>It was a reminder that as Dawg and Rowdy had matured, as their hearts became involved with their women, rather than just their cocks, their possessive instincts had kicked in. No one touched what they claimed themselves. They didn\u2019t share their women anymore, not even with each other.</p><p>And they didn\u2019t need to be involved in this. He knew Dawg and Rowdy, and he knew that knowing the truth would do nothing but worry them more.</p><p>They thought they knew Natches. That was the mistake most people made. They thought they knew him, understood him. They thought they could predict him, and they had found out they were wrong.</p><p>He turned away from his cousins, ignoring the worried looks they gave each other, and jumped into the jeep. Chaya\u2019s rental car was still sitting here; that meant they were in Zeke\u2019s official SUV. That wouldn\u2019t be hard to find.</p><p>Chaya would never be hard for him to find, no matter where she was or how she tried to hide. He had proven that to her. And now he was paying the price.</p><p>He had let her leave a year ago. He wasn\u2019t willing to do that this time around. He\u2019d find out what the hell she was doing here. Then, he\u2019d find Chaya.</p><p>He pulled from the parking lot in a squeal of tires and a grinding of gears before shooting out into the alley and heading for the main road. He didn\u2019t know the names on that list she had given Zeke, but he\u2019d find out tonight what was going on there. Until then, he\u2019d shadow her and see if he couldn\u2019t figure out what the hell was going on.</p><p>Because he knew she wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be with Homeland Security and she wasn\u2019t supposed to be in Kentucky.</p><p>So why was Chaya Greta Dane doing exactly what she wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing in a place she wasn\u2019t supposed to be?</p><p>And why the hell did he let himself care?</p><p>FOUR</p><p>Ezekiel Mayes was leaning against his car as Agent Dane pulled from the restaurant parking lot, and he waited. He had just dropped her back at her car, and knew he wouldn\u2019t have to wait long; he was just curious who would show up.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t left in suspense, and he had to hide his smile as the black jeep pulled in behind his SUV and Natches stepped out of the vehicle.</p><p>Those damnable glasses covered his eyes. The black lenses were a shield between Natches and the world, Zeke often thought. And damned if he could blame the other man. Natches hadn\u2019t exactly skated through life. Some years, Zeke knew, he\u2019d hung on by his fingernails alone as his father tried to destroy him.</p><p>Last year, Zeke feared, had been a breaking point for Natches. The day he had taken a bead on his first cousin Johnny Grace and pulled the trigger.</p><p>Natches had been one of the finest snipers the Marines had possessed. Often working alone, without the benefit of a spotter, completing his missions, then hanging around to gather intel. Four years in the Marines and he had nearly been a legend by the time an enemy sniper had taken his shoulder out.</p><p>If that was what happened. Zeke sometimes wondered. Natches wasn\u2019t a man one could slip up on, even from a distance. He had instincts like the sheriff had never known in another man. Instincts honed in the Kentucky mountains and in his father\u2019s home.</p><p>An ex-Marine himself, Dayle Mackay was one hard-bitten son of a bitch. If ever a man deserved a bullet, then it was Dayle.</p><p>\u201cFigured you\u2019d show up eventually.\u201d Zeke sighed when Natches didn\u2019t speak. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to get any info, if that\u2019s what you want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is she here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow-up is what I was told.\u201d Zeke shrugged; he didn\u2019t believe that one either. \u201cThey\u2019re still missing the million. I guess the government has to line their coffers somewhere, huh?\u201d</p><p>He tipped his hat back and stared up at the setting sun as Natches stood still and silent. What the hell was he thinking behind those glasses? Reading Natches Mackay was like trying to read ancient script. Pretty much impossible.</p><p>\u201cWho is she questioning tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Zeke shook his head. \u201cHell if I know. Said she\u2019d give me the names when we meet up in the morning. I couldn\u2019t get shit out of her.\u201d</p><p>She was as closemouthed as Natches was, and almost as wary. But where the man was stone-cold and silent, Zeke had seen nervousness in the agent. She had known from second to second exactly where Natches was behind them, when he would round a curve, or where he would park. That little girl had been so attuned to the killer shadowing them that Zeke had been amazed.</p><p>\u201cWould you tell me if you had?\u201d Natches asked him then, his big body shifting dangerously as he pinned Zeke with that shielded gaze.</p><p>\u201cIn this case, yeah, I\u2019d tell you.\u201d He nodded. \u201cBecause I want an end to this as well, Natches. What went down last year has ripped through this town like a plague. Homegrown fucking terrorists? God help us all. People are scared to trust their neighbors here now. And that bothers me. That bothers me real bad.\u201d</p><p>Pulaski County was his home, his county, his watch and his responsibility. It was one he took seriously, and until last year, he had thought he was doing a damned fine job at keeping out the worst of the evil the world had to offer.</p><p>Terrorists. Son of a bitch. It was bad enough when the bastards were foreign, almost fucking conceivable. But homegrown? A man you\u2019d known all your life?</p><p>He and Johnny Grace hadn\u2019t been friends, but if anyone had asked him if the boy could kill, he would have given an emphatic no. And he would have been wrong. If anyone had told him Johnny had been conspiring to steal and sell missiles that would be used against his own nation, Zeke would have denied it to the last line.</p><p>Johnny had been strange. He\u2019d been a little off in left field sometimes, but Zeke had never imagined what his smile hid.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s after more than the money.\u201d Zeke breathed out heavily at that thought. \u201cThere\u2019s something more important here than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell if I fucking know,\u201d Zeke cursed. \u201cYou Mackays tell me what the fuck is going on after it\u2019s done the hell over with.\u201d He flicked Natches a glowering look. \u201cIf you had been honest with me from the beginning, we wouldn\u2019t be standing here now, would we, damn it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat or we\u2019d be standing over your grave.\u201d Natches shrugged. \u201cWe were almost standing over Dawg\u2019s and Crista\u2019s. I didn\u2019t like that, Zeke.\u201d</p><p>The understatement was almost laughable. When Johnny Grace had taken Dawg\u2019s lover and tried to kill her, he had signed his death warrant with Natches.</p><p>There was nothing Natches cared for outside Rowdy, Dawg, and Rowdy\u2019s dad, Ray Mackay. Unless it was his sister, Janey. Zeke had never figured out for sure if he gave a shit about the girl or not, but he knew he\u2019d hate to test that boundary. Natches might act like she didn\u2019t exist, but Zeke was betting the other man kept very close tabs on the girl.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do here, Natches?\u201d he finally asked. \u201cDon\u2019t get between me and the law, man. I\u2019d hate to have to butt heads with you. But I will.\u201d</p><p>Natches\u2019s lips quirked humorously. \u201cI\u2019ll stay out of your law, and you stay out of my way. Other than that, I don\u2019t know what the hell to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Frustration gnawed at Zeke then. He really didn\u2019t need this. Natches was, Zeke often thought, the most dangerous man he knew. He wasn\u2019t given to strong temperament, he didn\u2019t hold grudges. But Zeke had a feeling that spilling blood didn\u2019t bother him overmuch either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need another killing like last summer, Natches,\u201d he warned him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to kill Johnny. You could have wounded him and left enough to question. Then we wouldn\u2019t have these folks running around now.\u201d</p><p>Natches didn\u2019t stiffen. There was nothing in his demeanor to indicate a change in mood. But the air around them seemed to crackle with tension and rage.</p><p>\u201cKilling him was better than sex.\u201d Natches\u2019s smile was cold enough, hard enough, that Zeke wondered if he should feel an edge of fear. There was something completely unaffected in that smile.</p> <p>\u201cBetter than sex with Agent Dane?\u201d Zeke had a feeling he had just taken his life in his hands with that question.</p><p>Natches stared back at him, his expression closed. Tight. For a moment, Zeke thought he would speak, thought something would finally pass by that tightly shielded expression of his. Instead, Natches turned away, jumped back into the jeep, and shoved it into gear before pulling away with careful restraint.</p><p>Zeke slowly let out his breath, unaware that he had been holding it after asking that last question. And he had no idea which way the answer would have gone.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to kill Johnny. You could have wounded him and left enough to question.\u201d</p><p>Zeke\u2019s accusation didn\u2019t sit well with Natches, no more than his response had. That killing Johnny had been better than sex. Hell, killing that little bastard had set up a sickness in his gut that he couldn\u2019t seem to get rid of. Not regret. There was no regret. It was Johnny or Crista, and Crista had been innocent. No, it was something else, something Natches hadn\u2019t known since he had taken a bead on Nassar Mallah, the traitor that had kidnapped Chaya in Iraq, and blew his damned head off. It was a knowledge that he was truly becoming a killer.</p> <p>Didn\u2019t matter the why of it, didn\u2019t matter that it was monsters he was killing. What made him sick to his soul was that he no longer felt regret. He hadn\u2019t regretted Nassar, and he hadn\u2019t felt any regret over killing family.</p><p>He was afraid he was turning into the same sick bastard his father was, and that terrified him. It terrified him almost as much as the knowledge that through the day, something had shifted inside him where Chaya was concerned.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t letting her walk away again. Not without having her. Not without fucking this hunger in his gut out of his system so he could survive the next time she decided to run out on him.</p><p>It was time to do something about her.</p><p>Natches drove through the darkened streets of Somerset, made a left onto the interstate and headed to the hotel Chaya was checked into.</p><p>Tonight, he wouldn\u2019t be staring into her darkened window, wondering why the hell she was there. Tonight, he would find out exactly why she was there, and what she wanted in Somerset. He could guess until hell froze over, but if Timothy Cranston was heading this little operation that was obviously being conducted in his town, then God only knew exactly what was going on.</p> <p>At least it had nothing more to do with the Mackays. Or not his end of the Mackays. He\u2019d held back the past week, watched, gathered his own information. Had he learned this operation targeted his family, then he wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to snatch Chaya and make damned sure Cranston understood it wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>Rowdy, Dawg, Kelly, Crista, his uncle Ray, and his sister. They were his family, and he\u2019d not allow pain to touch them any more than it already had. The information he had attained so far assured him the Mackays weren\u2019t targeted. Anyone else was fair game, and he was willing to help.</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t stay away from her much longer. He\u2019d never been able to stay away from her for long.</p><p>As he drove toward the hotel the memory of her rescue whispered through his mind. She\u2019d been hurt, abused, and terrorized, and married. And when she had learned her husband had been the reason for her capture and torture, she had cried in Natches\u2019s arms, while in the hospital in which she had been recovering. And she had begged him to help her.</p><p>He forced those memories back. He hadn\u2019t cared that she was married even before they learned her husband was a traitor. She was his; it was simple. Then he had learned it wasn\u2019t that simple.</p><p>She\u2019d walked away from him. Disappeared as though she had never existed, and for years he hadn\u2019t known where she was or how to find her. Until she\u2019d arrived in Somerset on the operation to locate the missiles.</p><p>And what the fuck had she done when that mission was over? Run. She had run from him again without looking back, without acknowledging a damned thing that had happened in that fucking desert.</p><p>And he had let her go.</p> <p>He pulled into the hotel parking lot and spotted her immediately where she stood, propped against the trunk of the rented sedan.</p><p>Her arms were crossed over the light blazer. She wore another silky top beneath it. Those short little thin-strapped tops were making him crazy. Jeans hugged her legs; the top of them rose barely to her hip bones, where the top she wore beneath the dark blazer barely met the band. And she wore boots. It was one of the first things he noticed last year; she wore leather boots. He surely did like a woman who wore boots. And boots on Chaya looked damned good.</p><p>He pulled up beside her, then he reached over and unlatched the door before swinging it open.</p><p>\u201cGet in.\u201d He didn\u2019t ask. He\u2019d gone too far to ask. He could feel the dominance, the possessiveness rising inside him, fighting against the restraint he was attempting to maintain.</p><p>She slid warily into the jeep and closed the door behind her before hastily locking her seat belt.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Her voice was soft, just a bit nervous, reminding him of that hidden hole and the darkness and the intimacy that had wrapped around them.</p><p>\u201cSomeplace where we can talk.\u201d</p><p>Where they could talk. Chaya stared out the windshield as Natches drove, his command of the vehicle confident, but obviously restrained. She could feel the fine thread of tension moving through him, the obvious control he was exerting over it.</p><p>And she knew what he was like when that control slipped. When the restrained man became the dominant lover. When he became a force she couldn\u2019t deny.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we need to talk about, Natches?\u201d she finally asked as he turned onto the main road and headed in the opposite direction of the marina.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to the boat?\u201d The Nauti Dreams had been his home last year.</p><p>\u201cWinter\u2019s coming on.\u201d His voice was as frosty as that season. \u201cI moved out to the apartment over the garage last year anyway. Damned lake is getting too busy.\u201d</p><p>There was leashed anger in his voice, a temper she didn\u2019t want to chance right now. She had heard of his dangerous temper, the cold, lashing rage he could project, but she had never experienced it herself.</p><p>Chaya couldn\u2019t imagine where she had found the courage tonight to actually get into the jeep with him. At one time she was known to have nerves of steel. Now she could feel the wariness moving through her. Not fear, but something female, something that recognized Natches as perhaps more man than she could handle.</p><p>Sometimes, Chaya reasoned, a woman just knew when she had too much man on her hands. Too much lust, too much strength, too much hunger. And all that described Natches only too well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been watching me,\u201d she finally stated. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He removed the glasses from his eyes slowly. How he managed to drive wearing the dark shades she hadn\u2019t figured out. But when he looked at her, it happened again. The same thing that happened every time she stared into the perfect forest green of his eyes.</p><p>The breath seemed to rush from her lungs, nerve endings heated, and between her thighs she felt a flood of liquid warmth she couldn\u2019t control.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come back,\u201d he finally said as he turned and took a side road that led to his garage. \u201cYou should have resigned from DHS like I heard you had and gotten the hell away from Cranston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with you watching me here? You knew there would be further questioning conducted in Somerset, Natches. Did you think it was really over? It won\u2019t be for Timothy until he finds the money and Johnny\u2019s coconspirator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so certain he had one?\u201d He shook his head at that. \u201cJohnny didn\u2019t share that easily, Chaya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike the Nauti Boys,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>She knew the rumors that the cousins shared their lovers and wondered at that, because Rowdy and Dawg seemed more than possessive over their women.</p><p>\u201cLong ago and far away,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>There was something in his voice that had her gaze sharpening on him. An ache of loss, of regret. Something that assured her he was right. Whatever sharing may have gone on in the past, it was over now. Her question, though, was how much he regretted it.</p><p>Silence descended then. Chaya watched as the darkened scenery sped by and they drew closer to the garage and the apartment over it.</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d He pulled in behind the garage and parked the jeep beneath the wooden steps that led up to the second floor.</p><p>The light on the overhead porch threw a glimmer of golden rays below to add to the subtle landscaping lights behind the shrubs that grew close to the building beneath the porch.</p><p>Chaya moved from the jeep and watched warily as he waited for her at the front of the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cHave you had dinner?\u201d he asked, placing his hand at the small of her back and giving her a firm push to the steps.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Mayes and I ate after the last interview,\u201d she told him, feeling his hand tense at her back.</p><p>She swung her head around to try to see him in the dim light. She could have sworn he growled something not quite complimentary where the sheriff was concerned.</p><p>\u201cKeep going, Chay.\u201d He crowded her, pushing her up the stairs, his larger, broader body making her feel too feminine, too weak.</p><p>She was a trained agent, or she was supposed to be, but every time she was around Natches the agent became overwhelmed by the woman.</p><p>He was her weakness; she had figured that out at a time when she hadn\u2019t needed to know it. And the certainty of it had only grown.</p><p>She stepped onto the landing and stood aside as he unlocked the door, stepped in, and looked around before turning back to her.</p><p>\u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>Her heart nearly strangled her as it raced in her chest and jumped to her throat. She stepped inside, staring around the starkly masculine area as she felt her palms dampen.</p><p>Here, she was in his territory, completely surrounded by Natches. She stepped farther into the room, then paused at the mantel over the gas fireplace. A smile tipped her lips. There was a picture of Faisal, the young goatherd who had managed to contact Natches on a shortwave radio channel to inform him that a female agent was being held and tortured in the desert.</p><p>He was her savior as well that day. Faisal had covered Natches while he pulled her out of that dark, hellish cell. She knew the extraction team that had picked them up had made certain Faisal made it back to his goats.</p><p>\u201cI talked to him a few months ago,\u201d he told her. \u201cHe said you were still sending messages and money.\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. She couldn\u2019t protect him; all she could do was try to make things easier.</p><p>\u201cHe makes a monthly trip past one of the bases in the area. I make certain he has something waiting for him there.\u201d</p><p>She could feel him behind her as he asked, \u201cDo you ever talk to him?\u201d</p><p>Chaya lowered her head and shook it. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t contact him personally.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d tried several times, had actually gone so far as to purchase the phone cards and send him her number. She knew he had his own cell phone now. One he was very proud of.</p><p>She turned back to him. \u201cDo you talk to him often?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, the movement sharp. \u201cHis family was killed just before your rescue. I\u2019ve been trying to make arrangements to get him over here. I haven\u2019t had much success yet.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she knew that, just as Cranston did. It was one of the promises versus threats he had made to force her into this operation. Cranston would make certain Faisal would be given his entrance into America, if this operation completed to his satisfaction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She felt a chill race over her head at the thought, then down her spine. Then it sort of went over her body as she forced herself to move away from Natches. Once Natches knew who DHS had targeted, he was liable to kill her and Cranston.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me, Natches? You know I can\u2019t give you this mission or Timothy\u2019s suspects; so what\u2019s left?\u201d She stared around the large living room with its heavily cushioned furniture and male accoutrements.</p><p>There were pictures of Natches and his cousins Dawg and Rowdy. A few that were taken while he was in the Marines with buddies. There was a picture of Natches with Faisal.</p> <p>A table had been set up at the side of the room with a jigsaw puzzle. Hell, she didn\u2019t know people still did those.</p><p>There were some oil lamps on a table and a heavy lamp on the end table next to the couch. The kitchen and living room were separated by a bar. There was no dining room, but the kitchen was large enough for the heavy oak table that was set to the side of the room.</p><p>She assumed the doorway off the living room went to a bedroom, but she wasn\u2019t checking that one out.</p><p>And as she stared around, she realized Natches hadn\u2019t answered her.</p><p>She turned back to him, watching nervously as he strode past her and moved into the kitchen, his expression stark, furious. This was it and she knew it. Natches wasn\u2019t going to let her avoid the past any longer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d have followed any other agent,\u201d he finally growled, pulling out a beer from the fridge and unscrewing the top with a quick jerk of his hand.</p><p>Broad, long fingered. Those hands could make a woman think of heaven even as hell moved in around them. And she knew they could make a woman fly, steal her senses and her thoughts with their touch.</p><p>Would he ever want to touch her with those hands after Timothy\u2019s operation finished here in Somerset?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see you back here,\u201d he said, staring back at her with a hint of sensuality, a hint of anger.</p><p>\u201cCranston has a way of convincing agents to do his dirty work for him.\u201d She shrugged with a mocking smile. \u201cCome on, Natches, you know how it works. The follow-up was important. He wants that money and he wants to make certain no one else is involved here. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you investigating my family?\u201d Short and to the point. And here was where things were about to get sticky. Because she couldn\u2019t lie to Natches. He had saved her, not just once but twice, and then he had held her and let her fly while she found her sanity once again.</p> <p>\u201cAs far as Cranston is concerned, everyone is suspect,\u201d she reminded him dryly. \u201cYou\u2019re all on my list to question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he send you?\u201d He lifted the bottle to his lips and drank, his gaze never leaving hers, the dark green depths dragging her in and leaving her breathless.</p><p>She was an agent, fully trained to ignore sexual need or even fear during a mission. But she couldn\u2019t ignore Natches. He made her weak, made her need, and he made her fear herself.</p><p>\u201cBecause it amused him?\u201d She lifted her shoulders as though she didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t care. \u201cHe was pissed over my attempted resignation and decided to play with me. Cranston\u2019s good for games like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCranston\u2019s good at games, period.\u201d Natches finished his beer, then tossed the bottle in the trash as Chaya watched him closely now.</p><p>He ran a hand over his face before staring back at her.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how much I missed you?\u201d he said, his voice soft. \u201cHow much I ached for you last year?\u201d</p><p>Chaya backed up a step, her movement jerky as she tried to look everywhere but at Natches. She didn\u2019t want to talk about last year; she didn\u2019t want to talk about five years ago. She wanted this over with. She wanted to run and hide, to bury her head in the sand and pretend this mission and this man could be ignored.</p> <p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have been very wise then, and it wouldn\u2019t be now,\u201d she answered, her throat tightening as she watched him, as she watched his expression flicker with primitive lust.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to just let her go this time, and she knew it. He was going to force her to face everything she didn\u2019t want to face, and she didn\u2019t know if she could do it.</p><p>Chaya shook her head at the look. \u201cDon\u2019t, Natches.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t handle his touch, not now, when this entire mission hinged on betraying him. She wasn\u2019t cold-blooded enough; she wasn\u2019t the agent Timothy thought she could be.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He shook his head wearily before running his fingers through his thick hair and staring back at her with an expression of torment. \u201cHow long is it going to lie between us like a double-edged sword, Chaya? When are you going to forgive me?\u201d</p><p>No. Oh God, she couldn\u2019t deal with this. Her throat tightened and closed with pain and fear as she saw the determination in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that.\u201d She gave her head a hard jerk. \u201cWe can argue over this operation or Cranston or anything else. But not that.\u201d She had to fight her tears, her sobs. She had to fight the memories that wanted to return in a rush of agony.</p><p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d He was across the room before she could avoid him. His hands gripped her arms as he jerked her against him, and she felt the heat of him, felt the weakness that threatened to flood her as she dragged in a hard, gasping breath.</p><p>\u201cFive years.\u201d He moved, forcing her to back up as she stared up at him in shock. \u201cFive fucking years, Chay. How much longer do we have to suffer for something that neither of us caused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her cry sounded too close to hysteria. \u201cStop, Natches. I can\u2019t discuss this. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a beautiful little girl. I saw her pictures later.\u201d His voice was agonized, tormented.</p><p>Chaya heard the pain-filled moan that left her throat. Even when she was being tortured, she hadn\u2019t made a sound like that.</p><p>\u201cHe stole her.\u201d He groaned the accusation as she felt his forehead press against hers. \u201cShe was safe with your sister, wasn\u2019t she, Chay? If he had just left her there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looked like you. She had your smile and your hair. Your innocence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d She screamed the words at him, tearing from his embrace as she pressed her fist against her stomach and swallowed back the sickness rising in her throat. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know her. You didn\u2019t raise her, and you didn\u2019t love her. And it\u2019s none of your damned business.\u201d</p><p>Beth. Sweet Beth.</p><p>\u201cShe was three years old, and your husband had her flown to Iraq. While you were being tortured, she was landing at the airport in a military transport believing she would see her mommy again.\u201d</p><p>Her heart felt as though it were shattering in her chest now, and she didn\u2019t want to collapse from the pain of it. She had lost everything in that damned desert. She didn\u2019t want to remember it, and she didn\u2019t want to think about it or talk about it. Especially not with the man who had been there to witness it, who had held her back, who had covered her with his own body to protect her while her child died.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She turned on him, tears she swore she wouldn\u2019t shed escaping now. \u201cWhy are you doing this to me? Do you think I don\u2019t know what happened?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was rasping. She sounded nothing like herself. She sounded like the demented creature she had been the day she lost Beth.</p><p>\u201cArmy Intelligence didn\u2019t know he had your child.\u201d His expression looked as agonized as hers felt. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give the orders to bomb that hotel, did they, Chay? Someone else did. Something fucked up like it always fucks up, and your baby was killed.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Her body shook. Tremors raced through her as she stared at the ceiling. But she didn\u2019t see the ceiling; she saw the missiles, ribbons of steam flowing behind them, the hiss of flight, the fiery destruction with impact.</p><p>\u201cI know who killed her,\u201d she whispered. She had always known.</p><p>Her husband. Beth\u2019s father. He had killed their child just as surely as he had ordered his wife\u2019s torture and death. But she knew even more than that. She knew there had been others, those who knew what her husband had done, and they had struck out. They had killed her child when there had been a chance of saving her.</p><p>She lowered her eyes back to Natches and saw the pain, his eyes so dark with so many emotions. Grief and sorrow and need.</p><p>\u201cYou hold her between us as though it were my fault,\u201d he said then, his voice graveled, accusing. \u201cAs though I ordered the attack or I arranged her death, Chay.\u201d</p><p>Chaya swallowed tightly and turned away from him again. She didn\u2019t know which way to turn, which way to run. She wanted to run. She wanted to escape the shared memories, and she wanted to escape her own loss.</p><p>Natches had been with her when they had learned where Beth and Chaya\u2019s husband, Craig, were staying. The suspected headquarters of a terrorist cell. He had raced after her when she went to rescue her child. He had thrown her to the street, held her down, and tried to shield her eyes as missiles slammed into the building.</p><p>\u201cI held you when you identified her. I held you then, and I held you through the night. Did you think I wouldn\u2019t hold you longer, Chay, if you had given me the chance?\u201d</p><p>FIVE</p><p>Craig Cornwell had been a major in Army Intelligence and a traitor. He had been selling secrets to Iraqi terrorists, and when he\u2019d known he would be identified for it, he had arranged for his daughter to be brought to Iraq, believing he could hold her for Chaya\u2019s cooperation in helping him escape.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have known the cell he was tied to had already been targeted and that their headquarters would be taken out so violently.</p><p>Natches stared into her face now, paper white, her golden hazel and brown eyes dark with the memories that tore at him as well. And he wanted to howl out in rage, in agony. Because he felt the need to wipe the horror from her. To tear aside that wall she had placed between them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d She tried to tear herself from his hold again. \u201cI never blamed you for her death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou blamed me for saving you instead,\u201d he snapped, fury rising inside him at the thought of losing her like that. \u201cIs that what you wanted for me, Chaya? For us? To have it all end that way?\u201d</p><p>And despite his anger, he could only touch her with tenderness. He lifted his free hand, brushed back the hair that fell over her forehead, and he ached.</p><p>\u201cThere was no us.\u201d</p><p>She only infuriated him with that statement, because he knew better. He\u2019d always known better. From the moment he\u2019d torn into that fucking cell and seen her struggling to drag that dead guard\u2019s clothes on, her eyes swollen shut, lips bloodied, and courage shining in her face, he\u2019d known there was going to be an \u201cus.\u201d It was just a matter of time.</p><p>And later, buried in that hole, waiting on extraction, he shouldn\u2019t have been attracted to her. She had been in shock. She had been hurt and fighting so valiantly to stay conscious. And in such a short time, she had dug her way inside him. Into a place he hadn\u2019t realized existed within the killer he had been shaping himself into.</p><p>He\u2019d breathed in her pain when she\u2019d realized her husband had betrayed her to the enemy, that he had betrayed his country and their marriage. And he had soaked in her pain the night she\u2019d lost her child. He\u2019d stroked her trembling body as she\u2019d begged him to hold back the horror of what she had seen. He had taken her, amid both their tears, and the next morning, when he\u2019d awoken, she had been gone.</p><p>He released her now, grimacing, feeling his flesh tighten over his muscles, as though something within him stretched dangerously, confined by his own skin and growing impatient.</p><p>\u201cI guess there wasn\u2019t, because you were gone the next morning,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were gone that night when I returned,\u201d she snapped back, anger trembling in her voice, anger and something else. A finely threaded emotion that had his gaze sharpening on her pale face. \u201cYou didn\u2019t come back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Natches stared back at her, his eyes narrowing. Had she come looking for him when he had believed she was gone?</p><p>\u201cI was called in that afternoon for a mission. It was a quick strike; I was flown directly to my drop-off. I returned three days later, and you had left Baghdad,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He remembered his rage. He had torn apart his quarters with it, and then he had torn apart the hotel room they had shared. The MPs sent after him hadn\u2019t fared very well either.</p> <p>As he stared at her now, he remembered all the reasons why he had gone insane over losing her. The lush lips, the stubborn angle of her chin. The way she knew how to smile, the feel of her coming alive against him. He had known all that before the day she had lost little Beth. He\u2019d known it because he had spent two weeks haunting that damned hospital, teasing a kiss out of her, a laugh. Knowing she was married, knowing she was bound to a traitor.</p><p>And she had known. She had known, and like a flower opening to the sun, she had slowly begun opening for him.</p><p>She shook her head now, her eyes, that deep golden gaze locked with his, the color shifting, shadowed with so much pain. \u201cTimothy said he checked. He was there that morning I went in to finalize custody of Beth\u2019s remains.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her breasts as though she were huggingthe pain inside herself when all he wanted to do was wipe it from her. \u201cHe wanted me to leave immediately to take Beth home, then join DHS. I wanted to talk to you first.\u201d She shrugged stiffly. \u201cYou were gone. He said he checked to see if you were on a mission and you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lying bastard. Natches grunted at that. \u201cDHS ordered the mission. They had a line on Nassar Mallah. I went out after him. When I finished and returned, you were gone.\u201d</p> <p>Chaya bit her lip as she moved across the room and lifted herself heavily onto one of the stools that sat at the counter. She looked tired; she looked hopeless. And that look tore at his heart.</p><p>\u201cSounds like Timothy.\u201d Her voice was nearly toneless. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t matter, not really. I couldn\u2019t function then, Natches. Not for either of us.\u201d</p><p>God he wanted to hold her now. What the hell was it about this woman? She was inside him, and five years of fighting it hadn\u2019t managed to push her out of his soul.</p><p>Was it love? Hell if it felt like anything he had seen out of Dawg and Rowdy. He didn\u2019t feel gentle. He felt like he wanted to devour her from head to toe. He wanted to roll around in oil with her. He wanted to lift her to that counter and spend hours eating the tastiest flesh he\u2019d ever found between a woman\u2019s thighs.</p><p>She was hurting, enmeshed in memories that he knew had to be ripping her guts to shreds. The sight of it made him crazy. He would do anything, say anything, to ease her pain, but by God she wasn\u2019t hiding from him anymore.</p><p>She held that past between them like a spiked shield, and he\u2019d had enough of it. Five years. He\u2019d let her torment him through endless, aching nights. He\u2019d suffered every nightmare he knew she suffered, and his pain for her sliced through his soul with each memory.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had long enough to begin functioning then.\u201d He had to force himself to stand back from her, to not touch her.</p><p>She looked lost, lost and lonely, almost as broken as she had looked the day they told her her husband was the traitor who revealed her to the terrorists who had kidnapped her.</p><p>He watched as her shoulders straightened then, her chin lifted. He didn\u2019t know what the hell she had in her mind now, but he knew exactly what she intended to do, and he\u2019d be damned if he would let her.</p><p>She was not walking out on him again. Not like this. This was the closest he\u2019d managed to get to her since the night her daughter had died. And then, it had been comfort, not need, not hunger. She had needed someone to hold on to. Someone to take her away from reality while she found a way to handle the coming grief.</p><p>He\u2019d given her that. He wasn\u2019t willing to be that someone to her again though. He wasn\u2019t a warm body to hold back the pain, and damn her to hell, he was sick and damned tired of being relegated to her past. A part of a memory she desperately wanted to forget.</p><p>\u201cI would have divorced him for one night with you.\u201d And all the need, the hunger, the driving, aching desperation he felt himself was echoed in her voice.</p><p>Her declaration surprised him though. And he could tell by the tone of her voice that it filled her with guilt.</p><p>She turned to him then, her gaze haunted. \u201cUsing the excuse that our marriage had been lost before then doesn\u2019t help. I took vows, and I meant them. But I was going to leave him, even before I knew he had betrayed me. I was going to leave him, Natches, and I made that decision because of you.\u201d</p> <p>He could feel the \u201cbut\u201d coming, and he knew it was going to piss him off. He could feel it in the tension gathering in the air around them.</p><p>\u201cHe was a bastard,\u201d he snarled before she could say anything more. \u201cYou knew it, even if you didn\u2019t have proof of it.\u201d</p><p>He had known it. Any man who allowed his wife to face danger alone deserved to lose her to another man. Women were precious. Women who loved, who honored their vows, were more precious than the finest gems. And Chaya would have honored those vows until the ink dried on the divorce papers. He knew it. And sometimes he wondered if he hadn\u2019t hated that part of her.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t excuse it,\u201d she said, staring at him from where she sat, her expression somber, her gaze flickering with guilt. \u201cI wanted your kiss, Natches. I wanted you; I wanted your touch and your voice whispering all those naughty little secrets you used to whisper to me when I was in the hospital. I wanted it. I was married, and I ached for it. And I paid for it.\u201d</p><p>It took a moment, one long, disbelieving moment, for that comment to soak into his head and light the spark of his normally rational temper.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d He stared back at her in complete amazement. \u201cI\u2019ll be a son of a bitch. You\u2019ve let that bastard steal your soul even from the fucking grave.\u201d His voice rose as he spoke. \u201cIs that how you\u2019re blaming yourself now, Chay? That Beth was taken from you because you wanted me?\u201d</p><p>Anger poured from him as he watched her flinch, saw the truth in her eyes. Stubborn pride lined every curve of her body. She actually believed what she was saying. Believed every word of it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to understand,\u201d she whispered, her voice hoarse.</p><p>\u201cI understand this, by God. If you were my wife, Chaya\u2014my woman\u2014you\u2019d never, fucking never, be on a mission without me. You\u2019d never face danger alone, and you\u2019d never know a night that I wasn\u2019t in your damned bed. How long had that bastard been out of your bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d Her voice trembled. He could see the fear in her eyes now, a fear that made no damned sense because she had to know he would never, never harm her. But damn her to hell, he was so furious with her that he wanted to slam his fist into a wall to relieve the rage burning inside him.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that he was fucking every trainee he could get his hands on didn\u2019t matter either, I guess,\u201d he sneered, furious, consumed by that fury as he realized the ways she had made herself pay for her daughter\u2019s death. And her hunger for him. \u201cThe fact that he managed to get your baby on a plane to Iraq without your knowledge because he was fucking your sister before the two of you left didn\u2019t matter either, did it?\u201d</p><p>Her face only tightened further. Her eyes raged though. He saw her eyes; he saw the banked fury, the agony that she tried to dim, tried to hide.</p><p>\u201cDid it matter, Chaya?\u201d He strode to her, his fist slamming into the top of the bar as she flinched from the sound of his voice and the crack of his flesh against the Formica. Hell, he cracked it again, and he didn\u2019t even give a damn. \u201cAnswer me, damn you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was no excuse,\u201d she screamed back, shuddering from head to toe, everything he needed to hear, everything he wanted to know, in her voice now. She wanted. Just as he did, she ached and she hungered for what was between them, and she was too damned scared to take it. \u201cThat didn\u2019t give me the right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it gave me the right.\u201d</p><p>Before he could stop himself, and God knew he didn\u2019t want to stop himself, he jerked her into his arms and slammed his lips down on hers.</p><p>He wanted to be gentle. She deserved it. She deserved sweet, liquid kisses. She deserved gentleness and warmth, and all he had was hunger, lust, and heat.</p><p>All he had was the need to taste the passion without the grief. The woman without the pain of loss.</p><p>And he had her. He felt the first resistance, shock and surprise. Her hands pressed against his shoulders, then her fingers curled. A second later, she made that whispery, whimpering little sound of surrender that he had only ever heard from her lips.</p><p>They parted beneath his kiss, opened to the stroke of his tongue, and a second later, a firestorm of need rocked through his body.</p><p>She kissed like a wanton, like a woman whose need for pleasure had grown to the same torturous depths his own had grown to. Satin-soft lips slanted beneath his; her tongue met his, licked and consumed and had him strung as tight as a banjo string within seconds.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough. The kiss was only the tip of the iceberg. He needed so much more from her. He needed more than he had known in that fucking desert, more than he had fantasized of over the years. He needed her rocking in his arms, lifting to his thrusts.</p><p>He groaned into the kiss, lifted her closer, felt the soft swell of her stomach cushioning the hard-on raging beneath his jeans, and knew he couldn\u2019t live without tasting more of her.</p><p>She was like a drug in his system, impossible to get rid of. And there were times he wondered if he didn\u2019t embrace this particular addiction. Her lips moving beneath his, her moans filling his head.</p><p>He fought back a growl as she tore her lips from his. He needed more.</p><p>\u201cI need more of you.\u201d Her lips were on his neck, biting, sucking, kissing, as her hands lowered to his belt. \u201cI need to taste you, Natches. Taste you all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell.\u201d Her fingers were lowering the zipper, parting the material, and shoving it aside to release the fully engorged, throbbing length of his cock.</p><p>As he watched, she went to her knees. How many times had he dreamed of this? Dreamed of her taking him like this.</p><p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d He flinched in agonizing pleasure as her lips parted and took him.</p><p>She was too hungry for preliminaries, and that only made him hotter. The head of his cock disappeared into her eager little mouth and immediately set flame to wildfire.</p><p>It flashed through his body, drew his balls tight, then had them knotting with ecstasy as her nimble little fingers began to caress and play with them.</p><p>And she sucked. She sucked his cock into her mouth, nearly to her throat, and drew on it, milked it until he was growling with pleasure. Her free hand wrapped around the shaft, stroked, tightened on it, and drove him crazy.</p><p>His hands were in her hair, his hips moving, fucking her mouth, and he loved it.</p><p>\u201cIs this how you used that little toy, Chay?\u201d The thought of that damned dildo infuriated him. \u201cDid you think of this, baby? Of me inside your mouth, fucking those sweet lips?\u201d</p><p>He had been dying to do just that, and she had filled her mouth with something else? Damn her. Not again. Never again.</p><p>She moaned around his cock head, and he nearly came from the pleasure of it. Sensation rippled through the shaft, into his balls, and up his spine. Holding on wasn\u2019t going to happen for long. He could feel the cum boiling in his balls, knew he wasn\u2019t going to be able to hold back.</p><p>\u201cDamn you. Suck it, baby. Show me how you sucked that damned toy and thought of me.\u201d</p><p>His teeth clenched as she moaned again, her mouth tightening, her tongue stroking and licking and drawing him so damned tight he felt as though he were going to break.</p><p>He was going to come. Ah, hell. Close. So damned close.</p><p>A second later he jerked back, fury pulsing, raging through him. Chaya fell back with a cry as he pushed her to the side and jerked the gun from the top of the couch where he had placed it and cursed furiously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The door had crashed open, Dawg and Rowdy rolling into the apartment like pure vengeance itself as Natches stared back at them in unholy fury.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you two doing?\u201d He barely had time to pull his finger back from the trigger as the men rose from the floor, their own weapons lowering.</p><p>Sometimes some information just took a minute to process. His head was still filled with the sweet scent and the heated feel of Chaya\u2019s mouth.</p> <p>And rather than searching for her own weapon, what the hell was she doing? Laughing. He glanced at her in disbelief. She lay on the carpet behind him, their bodies sheltered by the couch, which faced the door, and she laughed.</p><p>Her lips were red, her face flushed, and she was laughing with such damned amusement it made his back teeth clench.</p><p>And pure fury was burning in his brain, demanding he take action now. That he kick them out of his apartment with his foot up their asses for daring, even daring, to interrupt his pleasure.</p><p>The bastards were shadowing him.</p><p>There was no other explanation for their presence or the lock that had been torn free of the door. He only barely remembered hearing and ignoring their knock. He hadn\u2019t cared enough to answer the damned door because his head had been ready to explode with ecstasy.</p> <p>He slowly fixed his pants and tightened his belt. He laid the gun on the counter cautiously, watching as Chaya stared at him in something akin to wary surprise as she climbed to her feet, her eyes still bright with her laughter. He was glad someone was amused.</p><p>\u201cNatches.\u201d She laid her hand on his arm, her voice shaking as she obviously fought back more of those feminine, joyous giggles. \u201cIt\u2019s just Dawg and Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>She was staring at him now in rather the same way he would eye a rabid animal. And she had good cause to watch him just that carefully.</p><p>He turned back to his cousins, her hand still on him, and he was loath to break that contact. It was the only reason he wasn\u2019t charging them now. The only reason any of them were still standing rather than busting the walls of his apartment with their heads.</p><p>\u201cYou broke my door,\u201d he said carefully, staring at the two men as they watched him just as carefully.</p><p>Dawg sniffed, blushed to the roots of his black hair, cleared his throat, then glanced at the door and the lock that had ripped from the wall. \u201cYeah. Well. We were just coming up for a beer. Thought you could use some company and thought we heard fighting. Right, Rowdy?\u201d He nudged Rowdy.</p> <p>Dawg was obviously lying through his teeth, and Natches knew it. He turned to Rowdy then, forcing his fingers not to curl into fists as Chaya kept her hold on his arm.</p><p>Her grip had actually tightened in response to the flexing of the muscles beneath her hand.</p><p>\u201cRight, Rowdy?\u201d Dawg hissed again. Under other circumstances it might have been comical. Dawg was bigger, heavier, and his fist was a damned sight harder than Natches\u2019s. Sometimes. But it was obvious he didn\u2019t want to return to his wife bruised.</p><p>Natches turned to Rowdy.</p><p>And Rowdy grinned, because he knew. Natches saw in his eyes the knowledge that Chaya held him back, that Chaya could always hold him back.</p><p>\u201cNah, we were freezing our butts off outside because we thought Agent Dane might have a little more up her sleeve than a few questions.\u201d Rowdy\u2019s grin was cocky, which only pissed Natches off further.</p><p>Dawg winced. \u201cDumb ass,\u201d he muttered to Rowdy.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the vote of confidence, guys,\u201d Chaya laughed, and Natches felt her move.</p> <p>\u201cIf you try leaving this apartment, then I\u2019m kicking their asses the minute you walk out the door,\u201d he warned her.</p><p>She paused, and when he glanced at her, he could see the caution in her eyes again. \u201cThere are two of them, Natches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I have pure mad on my side. Want to take bets who will win?\u201d He made damned sure she saw nothing but determination in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re going to have to head to the Dreams tonight anyway.\u201d Dawg cleared his throat, and it might have placated Natches, seeing a hint of nerves in his cousin, if the amusement hadn\u2019t been so bright in his green eyes. Dawg was clearly enjoying the fact that he had interrupted something here.</p><p>\u201cI need to get back to my hotel.\u201d Chaya stepped back, and Natches let her.</p><p>He was careful to keep his expression bland as he glanced at her. She might try to run, but she wasn\u2019t going far. Hell, she was going to finish what she started before the damned interruption, and he was going to make sure of it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll, umm, fix the door.\u201d Dawg smiled, clearly enjoying the fact that, for the moment, Natches was leashed. \u201cYou go ahead and take Miss Dane back to her hotel, Natch. We\u2019ll have that beer at the boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I see you on my boat tonight, I\u2019m going to shoot you, Dawg,\u201d Natches warned him, and he was afraid he just might be serious. \u201cYou can try the beer tomorrow afternoon, not a moment before.\u201d</p><p>Natches moved too fast for Chaya to avoid him this time, his fingers curling around her upper arm before pulling her with him to the door. \u201cAnd make sure you nail the door tight. Some bastard walks in and steals my beer, and I\u2019ll kill you for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatches, I\u2019m not going to that damned boat,\u201d Chaya protested as they neared the door. \u201cI have a job to do. You\u2019re taking me back to my hotel. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I am,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>She almost paused, would have if he hadn\u2019t tugged her after him. \u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>Had he agreed too easily? He almost smirked.</p><p>\u201cSure I am. Sometime. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll need more clothes in a few days.\u201d He hardened his voice, firmed his grip, and ignored her curse.</p><p>She could bitch until hell froze over, but they weren\u2019t finished. Talking, fucking, he\u2019d take either one he could get, or both, but tonight, he wasn\u2019t letting her go.</p><p>Dawg rubbed at the back of his neck as he heard Natches\u2019s jeep drive off, and he turned to Rowdy slowly. His cousin had a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>Rowdy was a thinker. He always had been. He rarely jumped into anything impulsively, unlike his two cousins. He always weighed the evidence, the pros and the cons, and sometimes he could be damned scary in his predictions.</p><p>\u201cYou could have backed me there, cuz,\u201d he finally sighed when Rowdy stayed silent.</p><p>When his cousin turned to him, it was with a smirk that almost had Dawg bursting out in laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhy bother?\u201d Rowdy grinned. \u201cShe has a chain around his neck thicker than a junkyard dog\u2019s. He wasn\u2019t about to jump into a fight. That boy doesn\u2019t want a bruised body right now either, Dawg. We both know that one well.\u201d</p><p>Damned if they didn\u2019t.</p><p>Dawg remembered a time when a good fight and a good drunk was almost as good as sex. Now, since Crista, a fight, with the bruises, busted ribs, and/or swollen lips, was something he avoided at all costs. He liked the feel of Crista\u2019s hands on his body, demanding and wild as she moved against him. The thought of losing so much as an ounce of that pleasure to pain was intolerable.</p><p>Evidently, Natches was already considering that fact. Dawg chuckled at that thought as he moved to help Rowdy with the door.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still not pretty,\u201d he told his cousin. \u201cBut at least I didn\u2019t smell the smoke.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy grunted. \u201cSmoke wouldn\u2019t have mattered to Natches, Dawg,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>And that was the damned truth. Even last year, when she was lighting up every time Natches came around her, their cousin hadn\u2019t been able to stay away.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still not pretty,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem with her looks?\u201d Rowdy paused as they propped the door up and Dawg went in search of a hammer and nails. \u201cHe won\u2019t have to use a bag for her head. Hell, Dawg, I don\u2019t care what she looks like. Natches isn\u2019t ice anymore. He was scaring the shit out of me with that cold attitude of his. We\u2019re not far from losing him forever, if you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>And Dawg had noticed. Natches had been drawing further and further away over the years. He pulled the hammer and nails from the kitchen drawer and moved back to the door.</p><p>Her looks shouldn\u2019t bother him, and Dawg knew it. Crista had just torn into his butt the night before over a similar comment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just her looks,\u201d he finally admitted.</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her eyes. Look at her eyes, man. They\u2019re dead inside. That woman isn\u2019t even alive, and you can see it in her face. Her expression and her eyes. She\u2019ll destroy Natches.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy was quiet for long moments then. The sounds of the hammer striking wood and the four-inch nails sinking into the frame were the only comment Dawg received.</p><p>Finally, the door was secure, and Rowdy was just staring at it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dead inside,\u201d he finally said, his voice soft.</p><p>\u201cSame as.\u201d Dawg shrugged. \u201cYou didn\u2019t work with her last year. She\u2019s cold inside, man. She can get nervous as hell, she can get scared, and she did a fine laugh tonight, but there ain\u2019t no love in her for anyone.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy shook his head at that. \u201cThere\u2019s too much emotion.\u201d He looked at Dawg then. \u201cJust like Natches. And she\u2019s determined to hide it. You can\u2019t see past that need we both have to keep protecting our little cousin, Dawg. Sometimes I think we forget he\u2019s all grown-up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just as alone as he ever was,\u201d Dawg growled.</p><p>Rowdy shook his head. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>SIX</p><p>He didn\u2019t take her back to the hotel, just as he\u2019d told Chaya he wouldn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t remember Natches being this damned stubborn. Not that he couldn\u2019t give the proverbial mule a run for its money. But practically kidnapping her wasn\u2019t something he had done before.</p><p>\u201cWhy bring me here, Natches?\u201d she asked him as they stepped into the comfortable living area of the boat, and she stared around in interest.</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re not finished.\u201d He closed the door, locked it, and reset the security system.</p><p>She felt her heart race at the sound of the muted little beep from the security console. Somehow the boat seemed much more intimate than the apartment had. It wasn\u2019t just that the space was less open and smaller; it was as though a part of Natches himself was infused within the interior.</p><p>Dark browns and desert tones made up the color scheme of the furniture. The carpet was a creamy white. Small dark maroon pillows rested at the arms of the couch, and a rug of the same color was laid at the door. Heavy desert brown shades covered the windows, and the splash of golden light that fell from the table lamps softened the room.</p><p>The kitchen was separated by a combination table and bar. Laminate flooring stretched to the curved metal staircase at the far end of the kitchen and beyond, to what Chaya assumed were the bedrooms.</p><p>She turned back to Natches when he didn\u2019t explain further, and watched him warily. He reminded her of a caged beast straining against his restraints. It was there in the wild glitter of his dark green eyes, in the taut planes and angles of his face.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell did Cranston have to send you here?\u201d he finally asked, the guttural tone of his voice causing her to flinch.</p><p>\u201cThat was my question as well.\u201d She shrugged, watching him carefully as he strode past her to the refrigerator in the kitchen. \u201cHis answer was that I was his best bet. He didn\u2019t tell me what the bet was though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriving me bat-shit crazy?\u201d he asked as he twisted the cap off a beer and tipped it to his lips.</p><p>Watching him drink from the longneck bottle was sexier than it should have been.</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d She finally admitted there was a chance that that was exactly why Timothy had sent her rather than another agent. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t pleased with you or Dawg last year. And he does enjoy his petty little revenge games.\u201d</p><p>Actually, he normally had a solid reason for those games, they were just irritating as hell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the real conversation she and Natches were having was beneath the actual words, thrumming with tension.</p><p>Chaya couldn\u2019t forget. Anytime she was near Natches, every time she was within touching distance, the memories and the pain returned. And the need. The same need that had his erection buried between her lips earlier. The need to touch and be touched was stronger than the pain.</p><p>It had been five years. Losing Beth had nearly driven her crazy, but the years had helped her to sew closed the ragged wound that loss had left. She still cried sometimes; she still ached most of the time. But she had learned to go on. Beth was gone; there was no way to bring her back.</p> <p>But Chaya had always known that Natches was still alive. And the guilt she felt at the thought of going to him had always held her back.</p><p>While Natches had been teasing her in that hospital, seducing her, making her laugh, her daughter had been in danger. While she had made plans for a future that didn\u2019t include her traitorous husband, her daughter had perhaps been crying for her mother. And while she had been laughing with Natches, someone had been planning to bomb the building Craig had taken their child to.</p><p>Hunger, guilt, anger, and need vied inside her now just as they had for the past five years. They twisted inside her, making it impossible to see past what she had lost long enough to decide what she was running away from. And now she had no choice but to face it.</p><p>Whoever that faceless organization was that had managed to authenticate a strike code on that hotel in Iraq, it had to be stopped. It was too dangerous, its influence becoming too corrupt. There were moles in Army Intelligence, and Cranston had traced them to the op here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill Cranston when this is over.\u201d Natches set the beer bottle down on the bar, his heavy-lidded gaze moving over her again.</p> <p>That look made her sizzle. Chaya could feel all the nerve endings in her body coming alive. That look could make women across the world weak in the knees. He could bottle it and make billions.</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d She shoved her hands in the pockets of her jeans to keep them from shaking. To keep herself from shaking.</p><p>\u201cTake your clothes off.\u201d</p><p>Chaya blinked back at him, certain she hadn\u2019t heard what she knew she had heard.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s just that easy?\u201d She shook her head and wished it was. \u201cSorry, Natches, I\u2019m not here to be your toy. I\u2019m here to do a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can do both now.\u201d He grabbed his beer and finished it before tossing it in the trash can in the corner. \u201cYou can be Agent Greta Dane during the day and my toy at night. I promise you won\u2019t be in the least neglected, Chaya.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, she just bet she wouldn\u2019t be. And when the time came that Timothy decided to let them all in on the little game he was playing, what then? Would she be cast aside as all his other playthings had been?</p><p>\u201cYou have plenty of other toys, Natches; you don\u2019t need me.\u201d She wanted to sound flippant, uncaring, but she could feel the ache building inside her.</p><p>Five years. It had been five years since he had taken her. She had been so filled with pain then that she hadn\u2019t been able to appreciate the pleasure that had torn through her.</p><p>But she remembered it. She remembered his tears mixing with hers as he kissed her, just as she remembered how easily he had coaxed more than one explosive orgasm from her.</p><p>She watched him uneasily. He wasn\u2019t just going to take no for an answer, and she didn\u2019t know if she had the strength to hold back if he touched her again.</p><p>And he was going to touch her. She pulled her hands slowly from her jeans pockets as he advanced on her, his expression predatory.</p><p>\u201cNatches.\u201d She whispered his name in warning.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the door; run, little rabbit,\u201d he suggested, his voice wicked as he nodded to the door that led to escape. \u201cGo ahead. Or do you have the courage to actually take me on without excuses?\u201d</p> <p>Her fingers curled against her palm as he challenged her. The chance to touch him again, to feel whatever it was she had felt that night that she hadn\u2019t been able to forget. She hadn\u2019t been able to touch another man after that.</p><p>\u201cThat so isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d she retorted and wished her voice sounded stronger, wished it had more conviction.</p><p>She could feel herself preparing for him despite the protest. Her breasts were sensitive and swollen, the nipples throbbing. And between her thighs, she could feel herself dampening, her clit engorging.</p><p>She wanted. She ached. She had been aching this past week with a strength that had forced her to masturbate several times. And it hadn\u2019t been enough. It was never enough when she thought of Natches.</p><p>\u201cYou want me.\u201d He was too close now, standing in front of her, forcing her to look up at him.</p><p>He was so wicked. A rogue. She had called him that once, and he had laughed and winked as he agreed with her.</p><p>\u201cDoes just wanting make it all right?\u201d she whispered, catching his wrists as his hands settled on her hips. \u201cWanting isn\u2019t always enough, Natches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be enough for tonight.\u201d There was no plea in his words, just pure demand. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for forever, Chaya. I wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>And before she could question the angry tone of those last words, he was kissing her. His lips covered hers, his tongue pushed between them, and he was taking what he wanted. There was no question of giving it to him, because he didn\u2019t ask for a damned thing.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the teasing seducer she had known five years before. This was a conqueror. This was a man who refused to ask. He knew what he wanted, and God help her, he seemed to know exactly what she needed, too.</p><p>Chaya felt the world tilt around her; she could have sworn the ground shook. Whatever it was, it was Natches holding her, his lips on hers, his muttered, hungry moan vibrating against her lips as his mouth slanted across them and his tongue tempted and teased hers into an excited, erotic duel.</p><p>It was fire and lightning, this kiss. It was being awakened from a lifetime of nightmares and finally given light. It was like being reborn.</p><p>Chaya heard herself cry out, felt her arms latching around his neck, her body arching to him, needing more. More contact. More touch. Oh God, she couldn\u2019t get enough of him, and the need would destroy her. This need rocked her to her very core, to the center of that lonely, almost broken, spirit that had sent her running before. Because she couldn\u2019t face losing anyone else. She couldn\u2019t face losing Natches, too.</p><p>She trembled as she felt his hands caressing her, running along her back, pushing beneath her top and touching bare flesh. He moved against her, pressing his thigh between hers, rocking her against him.</p><p>She felt the delicate, sensitive flesh between her thighs flame. Wicked, greedy wildfire swept through her, and nothing mattered but more. More of his kiss. If she didn\u2019t get more of his kiss, she would lose her mind from the need. More of his touch. She wanted to be naked in his arms. Naked and shuddering and surrounded by Natches. Surrounding him. Burning as she only burned in her dreams.</p><p>\u201cThere, Chay.\u201d He pulled her closer, one hand on her butt, forcing her to ride the hard muscle of his thigh as she ground herself against him. \u201cSee how good it is, baby? Remember how hot it is?\u201d</p><p>Oh yes, she remembered. She remembered begging him for more, screaming for more. The memories were hazy because the pain had been overwhelming that night. But she remembered enough to know why she had ached in the darkness of the night after she\u2019d left Iraq. She remembered enough to know that, once he took her, she was never going to be the same again.</p><p>No more sleepwalking. She had existed the past five years, forcing herself through each day, refusing to acknowledge that a part of her, that hidden, feminine core of her, was right here. In Natches\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cNatches, let me breathe. Let me think,\u201d she gasped as his lips slid from hers\u2014lazy, confident\u2014and nibbled at her jawline. Her nerve endings rose up in a crescendo of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cNo thinking allowed.\u201d The rasp of his day-old beard sent shards of the most incredible pleasure washing through her body. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get these damned clothes off.\u201d</p><p>It was sexy. It was erotic. It was the most gentle act of sexual intensity that she could have imagined. He pulled her arms from around his neck, then, staring down at her, his forest green eyes darkening to moss, his palms touching her flesh along the way, he slid her blazer from her shoulders and over her arms.</p><p>Chaya stared up at him, unable to break the contact, the connection. He had done that before, she remembered. Stared at her, watched her eyes as he undressed her.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d She tried to protest, but it sounded more like an invitation. It was an invitation. Everyone knew Natches did anything anyone else considered a bad idea. And the more erotic, the more wicked, that bad idea was, the faster he was there.</p><p>\u201cWho needs good ideas? Come here, baby. Let me see those pretty breasts just one more time. Lift your arms for me.\u201d He pulled the hem of her shirt up and over her head, off her arms. It dropped to the floor as a hungry growl left his lips and long, thick lashes feathered over his eyes.</p><p>When he looked at her like that, she melted. Then she felt his hands at the belt of her jeans.</p><p>She was naked from the waist up, or practically naked, because the bra she wore didn\u2019t hide much from view.</p><p>\u201cNatches, I don\u2019t think I can stand through this.\u201d</p><p>And she didn\u2019t. Her knees were weakening. She could feel her legs turning to mush, right along with her objections. This was Natches. Wicked, erotic Natches. His kisses were a flame that burned to the icy core of her. His touch was an inferno, warming her from the inside out.</p><p>And she needed to be warm. Just for a little while. She needed to be warmed by him, just one more time.</p><p>As his lips moved over her neck, her arms found strength. As his hands pushed beneath the waist of her jeans, she struggled against him, pushing at his arms.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Chay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot easy.\u201d She nipped at his neck, clearly surprising him as she tugged at his T-shirt. She wanted him bare as well. She wanted to feel him against her, bare flesh to bare flesh. She needed it.</p><p>He whipped the shirt from his body and tossed it aside as her hands went to his belt. Shaking, uncertain, her fingers pulled and tugged at it.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, Chay. Get naughty for me.\u201d</p><p>She tore at the metal button, then eased the zipper over the hard, throbbing length of his cock. She moved it down slowly, working it over the stiff ridge as a hard growl passed his lips.</p><p>He wanted her naughty? She wasn\u2019t naughty; she was starving for him. Five years of pent-up hunger blazed through her, erupting from a well of need that she\u2019d had no idea existed within her.</p><p>Those distant memories from five years before didn\u2019t compare to this. The feel of his body, so large and broad, hard and muscular, bending to her, almost protectively. His lips on her neck, teeth rasping. His hands working her jeans over her hips as hunger seemed to permeate the air.</p><p>Chaya could feel perspiration gathering on her body, the heat building inside them, flowing around them, as she pushed at his jeans, frantic to get to the heated flesh of his cock.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, sweetheart; burn for me,\u201d he growled as his hands slid around to her rear, clenched, then lifted.</p><p>He raised her along his body, dragging her from her goal as a protesting cry fell from her lips. A second later, she felt the cool top of the low counter, heard a chair falling to the floor as he kicked it out of the way, and then Natches was kissing her again.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get enough of his kisses, or his touches. She couldn\u2019t kiss back enough, couldn\u2019t touch enough. She was consumed, inside and out, by a need so fiery she didn\u2019t have a hope of controlling it.</p><p>\u201cHere, get these off.\u201d He pulled away from her, despite her attempts to draw him back and the mewling sound that fell from her lips.</p><p>His hair was tangled, mussed from her fingers and framing his roguish face. Dark eroticism sharpened his features, his eyes. His bare chest was sheened with sweat, the hair prickling her fingers as she ran her hands down it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She ached for him now. Ached with a power that had her arching as she fought to breathe, as he pulled the boots from her feet and tugged her jeans down her legs.</p><p>She was naked but for the bra and panties. Scraps of material that did nothing to shield her from his eyes. And he was looking. His gaze went over her slowly as his hands smoothed up her legs, her inner thighs, parting them as he centered on the wet core of her body.</p><p>\u201cYou still shave?\u201d He ran the backs of his fingers over the damp cotton that shielded the swollen folds of her sex.</p> <p>Chaya swallowed tightly. \u201cWax.\u201d</p><p>Pleasure and anticipation tightened his features, and the look caused her womb to clench in response. He was aroused, dangerously aroused. She could see it in his face, feel it in his body.</p><p>\u201cFive years.\u201d His voice was guttural. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed about that one night, Chay, for five fucking years. Tormented by it. Driven fucking crazy by it.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted at the intensity behind the words. To be wanted like that. She had never been wanted so desperately by a man as Natches wanted her. And only once\u2014five years before\u2014had she felt this kind of desire for a man.</p><p>Five years. Too long. Too many memories, too many dreams and fantasies to fuel this hunger.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I ached. Every day.\u201d The words came from her, unbidden, the strain from the attempt to hold them back causing a sob to pass her throat. \u201cNatches\u2014you\u2019re going to destroy me.\u201d</p><p>His fingers hooked in the band of her panties, and he drew them slowly over her hips with the soft command \u201cLift.\u201d</p><p>She arched her hips, watching his eyes, his face, watching the hunger grow in him and feeling it grow in her.</p><p>He dropped the scrap of material to the floor, a grimace contorting his features as he forced his gaze from the glistening flesh between her thighs and stared back at her.</p><p>Chaya felt caught, trapped, and it terrified her. The power this man held over her. How was she supposed to fight this? Control this?</p><p>\u201cNow for this.\u201d His fingers moved to the front clasp of her bra.</p> <p>Chaya\u2019s breath caught in her throat as he flicked the tiny clasp open, then peeled the cups back from her breasts and pushed the straps over her shoulders. Her fingers dug into the countertop as she leaned back at the urging of his hands against her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty.\u201d His hands framed the swollen mounds, his fingers dark against her lighter flesh as he lifted them, caressed them.</p><p>Calloused fingertips stroked over the hardened nipples. Her womb convulsed, and she felt the damp warmth of her juices spilling from her.</p><p>\u201cNatches.\u201d She arched to him, distant memories of him bending to her, taking her nipple in his mouth, flashing through her mind a second before his actions followed her memories.</p><p>And the reality was better. She arched and cried out at the feel of his mouth, hot and hungry, devouring her nipple. His tongue lashed at it, rasped over it as he suckled, sending exquisite sparks of pure sensation exploding through her system.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Natches.\u201d Her head fell back as she felt her arms weakening.</p><p>As though he knew, sensed her inability to hold herself up to him, one arm curved around her back, tightened, and allowed her hands to lift from the counter as he lowered her, her arms curling around his shoulders, her nails digging into his flesh.</p><p>His mouth was so hot, his tongue like a brand burning across her nipple. First one, then the other. He sucked at the hard points greedily as she became lost in a vortex of pleasure she knew she could never escape.</p> <p>\u201cAh, yes, that\u2019s my Chay.\u201d He ran his tongue in the valley between her breasts.</p><p>She shivered at the caress, her thighs tightening on his, her hips undulating at the subtle pressure of his cock head against the slick folds of her sex.</p><p>She needed him there. She needed him to take her. Hard. Fast. Deep.</p><p>\u201cI missed this,\u201d he crooned as his lips began to kiss a path down her stomach. \u201cMissed touching you, feeling you against me.\u201d</p><p>Her back arched as a tremulous cry tore from her.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember it, Chay? So hot it burned us alive? So much pleasure we thought we were dying.\u201d</p><p>She remembered it. She remembered all of it. Like an inferno blast that she had convinced herself was no more than her need to escape her pain. It had been so much more though. Because it was hotter this time, the ache deeper. It was Natches. His touch was like an addiction, and the need only grew the longer the separation. There was no going cold turkey. No escaping the effect of it.</p><p>\u201cAhh, so sweet.\u201d His tongue licked over the top of the mound between her thighs. So close to her clit. So close she could feel the heat of it, anticipate the wild ecstasy it could bring her.</p><p>When it came, it shattered her. Because it was even brighter, hotter, than she remembered, the pleasure swirled through her fear and dissipated it. The need for control evaporated. She was lost in the pleasure, and there was no other place to be. No other place she ever wanted to be.</p><p>His tongue slid around her clit, and he groaned against it.</p><p>\u201cSo sweet, Chay. You taste like summer.\u201d</p><p>Her hands speared into his hair, the thick, silken strands twining around her fingers as she fought to pull him back to her.</p><p>And he chuckled against her flesh, a dark, greedy sound. His tongue licked slow and easy through the narrow slit so rich with awakened sensations. Nerve endings came fully alert, too close to the surface of her skin, reveling in his touch again.</p><p>She called out his name, her voice hoarse with need, begging him to take her. His hands pushed her thighs farther apart, his head dipped, and his tongue filled her. Ecstasy nearly shattered inside her. So close. She was so close.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She moaned, feeling her release, so close, almost there. Oh God, she needed to come. She needed that wild explosion tearing through her, the release she had only known one other time, had only known with Natches.</p><p>\u201cAre you mine, Chaya?\u201d His voice was a dark, seductive croon, pulling her in as he licked again, drawing her taste to him, stroking her into an abyss of sensation and pleasure.</p><p>She would give him anything for this. Be anything he wanted as long as she had this.</p><p>\u201cYours.\u201d She was barely aware of the word tearing from her lips. \u201cAlways yours, Natches. Oh God, I\u2019ve always been yours.\u201d</p><p>He paused, a short moment of stillness that her breath caught, then his lips surrounded her clit, drew it into the suckling heat of his mouth, to the licking tip of his tongue, and he pushed her over that edge.</p><p>She felt the explosion rip through her, drawing her up, arching her against him as a throttled scream left her lips and she dissolved into him.</p><p>She melted. For a moment, just for a moment, she felt herself sinking into the very pores of his flesh, and understood that this was where she belonged. This was the addiction that was Natches. To belong to him so deeply that she was a part of him.</p><p>And it lasted for an endless moment. Then he was lifting his head, pushing her legs apart, and before the final wave of release washed through her, he began working the hard length of his erection inside her.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, damn you.\u201d</p><p>Chaya\u2019s eyes jerked open at the command. Dazed, almost unfocused, she stared up at the dark vision of every woman\u2019s sexual fantasy come to life.</p><p>Black hair framing savage features, green eyes almost glowing in his sun-darkened face, nostrils flared in desperate hunger as his lips drew back from his teeth.</p><p>Raw erotic pleasure tore through her at the sight. This man, this sexual intensity, centered on her. On plain Chaya Dane, and God only knew Natches was more man than she had any hope of controlling.</p><p>And there was no need to control him now. Pleasure swamped control. There was no thought of control, only sensation\u2014the feel of him working his cock inside her, the thick crest parting tender tissue as perspiration began to form on his shoulders and chest and run in small rivulets along the center of his body.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Chay.\u201d His voice was deep, hoarse. \u201cLet me see you, baby. Let me see if I\u2019m making you feel good. Does it feel good, Chay?\u201d</p><p>Feel good? He was destroying her with pleasure. Her lips parted to tell him, but all she could do was moan his name and stare back at him. And feel him. Feel him stretching her, burning her. She was locked in a grip of ecstasy\u2014it thrummed through her veins, heated her blood and tormented her nerve endings.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Chay.\u201d His voice hardened when she would have closed her eyes.</p><p>Forcing them open, she stared back at him. His jaw was clenched, sweat dripped along his forehead and down his face. His shoulders bunched, and she felt his thighs tighten as he pulled his erection back, then worked it into her farther, deeper, taking her until she was trying not to scream, until she was burning around him, and with a strangled groan, he buried himself full length inside her.</p><p>Hard hands clenched on her hips as he penetrated her fully, and some dark emotion in his eyes flared.</p><p>\u201cHas there been anyone else?\u201d She watched him speak, heard the words and tried to make sense of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther men. Has another man taken what\u2019s mine, damn it?\u201d Pure male dominance flashed in his expression, in his eyes.</p><p>Another man? She shook her head; she couldn\u2019t bear another man\u2019s touch. Didn\u2019t want it. Never, ever thought of it.</p><p>She shook her head again. \u201cNo one. No one but you . . .\u201d She wanted to tell him she only wanted him, only needed him, but as the words tried to slip past her lips, he moved.</p><p>As though the admission broke the last of his own control, he was moving inside her, plunging, fucking her with fast, furious strokes that threw her almost instantly into orgasm.</p><p>It was like that with Natches. So wild there was no hope of holding on. So hot there wasn\u2019t a chance of not burning alive.</p><p>She arched and cried out his name. Her eyes closed, her neck lifted, and she felt him tighten, heard his hoarse exclamation before she felt him spill inside her. Heated, fierce jets of semen spurted into the quaking depths of her vagina and pushed her into another, destructive release, and to an edge of fear. Just the tiniest spark of concern because she knew there was something she should have remembered, something she should fear in this pleasure. A pleasure that left her sated, filled, and somehow, she knew, irrevocably bound to Natches in a way she never had been before.</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>Natches wasn\u2019t certain what brought him awake just after daybreak. The sun wasn\u2019t shining through the windows yet, and there was a light chill to the air.</p><p>At the end of October, it could get cold on the water. His bed was warm though, and he was drowsy and seeking the touch of Chaya\u2019s body when it hit him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in the bed.</p><p>He listened carefully and couldn\u2019t hear her moving on the houseboat or in the shower. Irritation washed through him instantly, as well as a healthy dose of anger.</p><p>He sat up in the bed, his eyes narrowed against the gloom that filled the large bedroom as he glanced at the clock.</p><p>It was barely seven, too damned early to be up and moving around unless he had actually intended to be at the garage that day. Which he hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d intended to spend the day happily rolling around the bed with Chaya.</p><p>As he moved to flip the blanket back, he saw the paper on her pillow and picked it up before reading it silently.Am meeting Sheriff Mayes this morning. I have work to do. Will call you this evening.</p><p>She would call him this evening?</p><p>He crumpled the note slowly in his hand, and for just a second, only a second, a grim sort of humor touched his mind. How many times had he either written or stated that sentiment, never to return?</p><p>Oh, if she thought for a single damned minute she was getting away that easily, then he\u2019d just have to show her different. He\u2019d let her go twice. Third time\u2019s a charm, sweetheart, he thought furiously. This time, she was stuck, and he\u2019d make certain she understood that. Clear to her soul. No matter what it took.</p><p>Stomping from the bed, he headed for the shower. If he knew Zeke Mayes, and he did, then sweet little Chaya\u2019s day wasn\u2019t going to begin until after ten. Zeke had his rounds to make, his paperwork to do, and then he headed to the diner for breakfast around nine thirty or ten. Plenty of time for Natches to get ready and reach Chaya\u2019s hotel. He\u2019d drag her back to the houseboat and show her exactly how this relationship was going to work from here on out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He paused as he stood beneath the shower spray. Relationship. Hell, he\u2019d never had a relationship. Until now. Until Chaya. He\u2019d never kept a woman around long, never wanted to, but he was starting to suspect he wanted to keep Chaya forever.</p><p>He finished his shower, dressed, and was downstairs in the living room pulling on his boots when a fist landed in imperative demand against the door.</p><p>His head jerked up, then he lowered and shook it in resignation. He knew that knock.</p> <p>Pushing to his feet, he stalked to the door, pulled the shade back, and glared at Dawg as he slid the door open.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Crista draggin\u2019 your ass to the lumber store?\u201d he smirked. Dawg\u2019s wife kept him on a very short leash. Dry cleaned and pressed clothes that looked presentable rather than day-old and holey. A decent haircut. But the scowl on his older cousin\u2019s face hadn\u2019t changed by much.</p><p>\u201cCrista\u2019s not feeling well this morning.\u201d Dawg shrugged as he stepped into the boat. \u201cWhere are you headed off to this early? I thought you took Fridays off from the garage now.\u201d</p><p>Natches watched curiously as Dawg prowled the living room and the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you start checking up on me?\u201d Natches leaned against the wall and crossed his arms over his chest as he watched Dawg.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you came back from Iraq and started actin\u2019 brick dumb.\u201d Dawg grunted as he turned to face him. \u201cYou know, I always wondered what the hell made you so much harder while you were gone. What did she do to you? Screw around on you? And you\u2019re heading right back into trouble with her?\u201d</p><p>Natches stood still. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go there, Dawg,\u201d he told him carefully. \u201cChaya\u2019s not the reason for however the hell I was acting or whatever I may have done. I didn\u2019t poke my nose into your hijinks with Crista, so I\u2019d suggest you stay out of my relationship with Chaya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelationship?\u201d Dawg narrowed his eyes on him. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had a relationship in your life, Natches. Are you sure you know what the hell you\u2019re doing here?\u201d</p><p>Natches uncrossed his arms enough to scratch at his jaw and remember the fact that he had forgotten to shave. Again. But his cousin\u2019s attitude was bothering him more than the growth of beard on his cheek. Dawg had been acting strange ever since he had learned Chaya was back in town.</p><p>\u201cDid you know what the hell you were doing with Crista?\u201d he finally asked. \u201cCome on, Dawg; you blackmailed her into sleeping with you. Did I give you grief over it?\u201d</p><p>Dawg grimaced at that. He stood there in his jeans, shit-kicker boots, and that perfectly pressed long-sleeved shirt of his and glared at Natches again.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is Agent Dane back here anyway?\u201d</p><p>Natches shrugged. \u201cTying up loose ends is what I hear. What do you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear Cranston\u2019s running another op,\u201d he snapped. \u201cAnd Agent Dane is smack in the middle of it. Did she let you in on that little piece of information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t exactly get around to discussing it,\u201d Natches informed him. \u201cFirst you and Rowdy broke down the door to my nice warm apartment, and once I got back here, I wasn\u2019t exactly in the mood to fight with her. What the fuck is your problem anyway? You\u2019re acting like a worried father. I didn\u2019t exactly stay out past curfew.\u201d He smirked at the thought. \u201cMan, Crista is so domesticating you that it isn\u2019t even funny.\u201d</p><p>And damned if a flash of pride didn\u2019t hit Dawg\u2019s expression, rather than anger at what he would have once termed an insult.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Natches breathed out in irritation. \u201cI know you and Rowdy have been following me around like a spy after secrets. You can stop now, okay? I\u2019m a big boy. I do real good on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil Agent Dane hit your life?\u201d Dawg snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing some checking. Before that bullet took out your shoulder, Natch, you were self-destructing like hell. Taking every mean-assed suicide assignment you could find. Why? And why the hell did it come around just months after you rescued some blond agent from a hellhole in the Iraqi desert? Tell me that agent wasn\u2019t the same one messing your head up now.\u201d</p><p>Natches was quiet for long, silent seconds. He stared at his cousin, promising himself he wasn\u2019t going to lose his temper. If he lost his temper, then he\u2019d miss Chaya. And on top of that, he and Dawg would end up whipping on each other with enough force to leave both of them bruised and limping for days. Nope. Wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p> <p>\u201cLock up when you leave.\u201d He turned and walked out the door before stepping from the small deck onto the floating walk.</p><p>He heard Dawg curse behind him, and he ignored it. His cousin was fishing, and Natches wasn\u2019t biting. It was Dawg\u2019s favorite means of getting answers from Natches, and it used to work. Piss him off and get him fighting. He didn\u2019t give a damn what he said to Dawg or Rowdy then. He would just spill his guts right there in the middle of a fight.</p><p>Natches grinned at the thought. Hell, those were the days. Before the Marines, when they were young and wild and filled with too much damned ego. Long ago and far away. More than eight damned years ago.</p><p>As he dug his keys out of his pocket and moved from the docks to the parking lot, he glanced back down the marina, flashed Dawg a smile, and lifted his hand in farewell. His cousin was standing there with his hands propped on his hips, and even from where he stood, Natches could see the scowl on his face.</p><p>Dawg had never liked Chaya, and Natches knew why. His older cousin had spent too many years trying to protect his younger cousins. Seeing Chaya again last year had ripped Natches\u2019s guts out. It had torn into him knowing she wasn\u2019t ready to push past all that pain inside her yet, knowing it wasn\u2019t time to claim her. And unfortunately, Dawg had witnessed Natches\u2019s struggle; he just hadn\u2019t been positive who the woman was.</p><p>Sometimes it concerned Natches, the way he knew things about Chaya. Knew when to push her, when to just hold her. It was in her eyes, those needs she had, swirling in the golden depths. And the harder she fought it, the more she needed.</p><p>Last night, she had been like a firecracker ready to explode before he had even touched her. Those pretty golden brown eyes had been frosty, her expression closed, every line in her body straining to hold distance between them. Because what she felt scared her, scared her all the way to the bottom of her soul, and she knew it.</p><p>He unlocked his jeep and pushed the key in the ignition as he considered that, and the implications of it. Maybe Dawg had reason to worry, because Natches had a feeling he was only just beginning to realize how far over his head he was with Chaya. He was very much afraid that he just might love her.</p><p>Dawg watched Natches drive away and shook his head before jumping the short distance between Natches\u2019s deck and his own. And Crista was waiting for him, standing in the door, watching him curiously as he cast another scowl back at Natches.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re still in one piece anyway.\u201d She looked up and down his body, her eyes twinkling in her still-pale face.</p><p>\u201cYou should be lying back down.\u201d He let his gaze sweep over her now, his heart softening in his chest even as his cock hardened in his jeans. Damn what this woman could do to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling a little bit better.\u201d She shrugged, looking away from him before turning and moving back into the houseboat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too cool outside for you to be standing in the doorway like that.\u201d He closed the door before frowning.</p><p>Maybe it was time to move out to the house. It was almost finished. He could push the contractors and get the carpet laid sooner than the spring date they had quoted him. A little extra money and they\u2019d come out sooner. It hadn\u2019t been too cold last year, but still cold enough that she had insisted on wearing too many clothes. And the walkway had gotten icy a few times. He didn\u2019t want to risk her falling into the water.</p><p>He made a mental note to call the contractors later that morning, deciding he didn\u2019t want to spend another winter on the water. Summer and fall would work if they decided the house didn\u2019t suit them to live in year-round.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Dawg.\u201d</p><p>He grunted at that as he moved to the refrigerator. \u201cYou ready for breakfast yet?\u201d</p><p>She was silent; he turned back to her, and he swore she was more pale than she had been moments before.</p><p>\u201cI think I need to go lie back down.\u201d She headed for the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI think you need to see the doctor.\u201d Something snapped inside him then. Fear. Dawg had rarely known fear, but he had never seen Crista sick either. \u201cCall him this morning, Crista.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She shook her head as she headed up the stairs, her voice strained.</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d he muttered, moving behind her and catching up with her as she was pulling the blankets over herself.</p><p>Sitting next to her, he touched her forehead. She felt clammy, but she wasn\u2019t running a fever. She was pale though, and that worried him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a bug.\u201d She sighed. \u201cEveryone\u2019s sick at the store, Dawg. Just because you can\u2019t catch a virus doesn\u2019t mean the rest of us can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She sounded jealous, and he had to grin. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you nice and healthy before no time,\u201d he promised her. \u201cJust living with me will rub all those good healthy genes off on you.\u201d</p><p>She snorted at that. \u201cGo away and let me sleep. And you need to check the deliveries this afternoon. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI\u2019ll have Layla\u2019s husband check them. I\u2019m staying here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She looked up at him, her gaze sharpening for a moment. \u201cWhy are you so upset over that woman staying the night with Natches?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t sound jealous; she sounded concerned. The question had him rubbing at the back of his neck in irritation.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s up to something. That\u2019s Timothy Cranston\u2019s little pet, Agent Greta Dane. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too damned plain,\u201d he muttered, knowing she wouldn\u2019t understand any more than Rowdy did.</p><p>Her lips quirked in amusement. \u201cYou\u2019re not the one sleeping with her; so why should you care?\u201d</p><p>He glared at the dark carpeting on the floor before lifting his gaze back to her. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It bothers me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s actually a very pretty girl,\u201d Crista told him. \u201cIt\u2019s not her looks that bother you.\u201d</p><p>A frown snapped between his brows. \u201cI know a pretty woman when I see one.\u201d</p><p>And she smiled at that. A smile he didn\u2019t quite understand. It was patient and amused and made him grit his teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s mothers who are supposed to protest the girl\u2019s looks, not fatherly cousins.\u201d</p><p>Her comment had him staring at her in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>And she shook her head. \u201cYou have to let them go sometime, Dawg. Natches is all grown-up now. Let him try his wings a little bit. It might not be as bad as you think.\u201d She was on the verge of laughing at him.</p><p>\u201cYou obviously have a very strange virus,\u201d he grunted, put out that she was laughing at him, that she just didn\u2019t understand what he didn\u2019t understand himself. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t protest. She just yawned a little and pulled the blankets closer to her chin. \u201cIt\u2019s cold in here.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, maybe it was time to move to the house. He was definitely calling those contractors. Then he was going to make another call and find out just what the hell Agent Dane was doing back in town.</p><p>Chaya made sure she spent no more time in her hotel room than she had to. She was betting Natches was a very early riser. She showered, dressed, dried her hair, and pulled it back into a ponytail, and within an hour she was out of there. And not a moment too soon. When she pulled her rented sedan onto the interstate, she swore that she saw Natches\u2019s jeep headed toward the hotel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glanced at her watch and breathed out roughly. She had an hour to kill before meeting the sheriff at the diner. That was going to be a long hour, considering the fact she had to make certain to avoid running into Natches.</p><p>And who the hell was she kidding? An hour later, she pulled into the diner and stared at the wicked black jeep sitting beside the sheriff\u2019s cruiser, and clenched the steering wheel of her car.</p><p>He was in there, waiting on her. She had run out on him this morning, terrified of what had happened the night before, leaving only a note. At least she had left a note this time, she assured herself. She had told him she would call him this evening, hadn\u2019t she?</p> <p>She jerked her case from the seat beside her and pulled herself out of the car. She forced her chin up, stared around the parking lot, and glimpsed both Rowdy\u2019s and Dawg\u2019s vehicles as well. Didn\u2019t any of those damned Mackay men work? Surely they had something better to do than to harass her this morning?</p><p>Evidently they didn\u2019t.</p><p>As she entered the diner, she flicked a look at the table beside the one Sheriff Mayes was sitting at, and restrained the urge to grimace. Three Mackay men sipping coffee. Rowdy looked amused, Dawg looked pissed, and oh boy, Natches looked ready to hit the damned roof.</p><p>Sheriff Mayes, that bastard, didn\u2019t even bother to hide his laugh as she walked in.</p><p>She moved through the diner, thankful there were very few customers, and stopped in front of Natches. \u201cAre you following me today as well?\u201d</p> <p>He tipped the glasses he wore lower on his nose and glanced up at her from over the dark lenses. She almost flinched at the anger burning in the forest green depths. He was livid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d he stated. \u201cAs soon as you tell Mayes over there that\u2019s the deal.\u201d</p><p>Shit. That wasn\u2019t the deal. That was expressly\u2014with an unqualified no\u2014forbidden.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that, Natches.\u201d She forced herself not to show her own nervousness, or a reaction. She couldn\u2019t, not here. He would take any weakness and run with it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do it like this, Chaya,\u201d he warned her then, and she could feel her stomach tightening in dread.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d She refused to glance at the other two men for their reactions. \u201cThis is my job, Natches, and you\u2019re no longer a part of that team.\u201d</p> <p>And then he smiled. She could feel her throat going dry, and she swore she could feel her stomach drop with pure female terror. This was one full-grown, pissed-off alpha male, and she was going to pay. She could feel it clear to her bones.</p><p>Not painfully. Not in bruises, in blood, or in insults. But, oh boy, was he going to get her for this one.</p><p>\u201cWell, Natches, I guess she\u2019s not as easy as we all thought she was.\u201d Dawg leaned back in his chair and shot her a tight smile. \u201cNatches seemed to think you could see reason, Agent Dane. He even said you were smarter than to say no to him.\u201d</p><p>She turned her gaze to him, keeping it cool, detached.</p><p>\u201cOh, I see reason quite well, Mr. Mackay,\u201d she assured him. \u201cAnd if I had my preferences, then his company would be welcome. Unfortunately, Special Agent Cranston made his wishes clear before I arrived. And in this case, that prevails.\u201d</p><p>Natches muttered something uncomplimentary about Cranston that she highly agreed with.</p><p>Dawg shook his head, his smile jeering now. \u201cLoyalty, Agent Dane? Where\u2019s your loyalty? To your own butt or to those who can watch your back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Dawg.\u201d Natches\u2019s voice was hard with warning.</p> <p>\u201cLet her answer the question, Natches.\u201d Dawg held her gaze. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear her answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what.\u201d Her smile was benign, emotionless. He didn\u2019t like her. He\u2019d never liked her, and she didn\u2019t give a damn. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go? Then you can share that federal prison with me when Cranston finds out about it. I hear big, tall guys like yourself are really popular there. You\u2019re cute, James Mackay. They like cute rednecks with attitude there. Consider them a challenge, you know.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy snorted, and she could have sworn Sheriff Mayes was choking behind her.</p><p>Dawg\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re playing in the big league here, little girl. You don\u2019t want to keep this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said enough, damn it!\u201d</p><p>Even Chaya flinched as Natches\u2019s hand hit the table and he came halfway out of his chair. She stared at him, shocked, surprised as he and Dawg both seemed to hover over the table, almost nose to nose.</p><p>\u201cWatch it, kid,\u201d Dawg snarled. \u201cI still remember how to wipe the floor with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I still remember how to lock both your asses up in the county jail.\u201d Sheriff Mayes, his voice hard, commanding, stood by the table now. \u201cCome on, Agent Dane, before you cause these two to fight like the hellions they used to be rather than the grown men I thought they were.\u201d</p><p>Chaya stared at Natches, amazed, disbelieving as he straightened, his body tense, his expression furious.</p><p>\u201cIf you get in a fight, I\u2019m not going to be happy with you,\u201d she stated coolly.</p><p>\u201cAbout as happy as I am with you right now?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cTry even less so.\u201d She lifted her chin a notch and reined in her anger as she turned to Dawg. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t back down, I\u2019ll have a talk with your wife. I have a feeling she\u2019s more inclined to act decent than you are at the moment. I wonder how she would feel if she were to find out about this little fiasco this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you threaten me with my wife.\u201d He glared back at her, but some of the heat seemed to leave his voice.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t push me, either of you. Because I could get sick of dealing with thick-skulled rednecks really fast. Unlike you, Dawg, I don\u2019t bite and snarl; I get to the heart of the problem and the solution. When you\u2019re willing to tell me what your problem is, then we\u2019ll talk. Until then, stop sniping at Natches, or I\u2019ll talk to Crista at first opportunity. Good day, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>She turned on her heel, ignoring their surprised looks before joining the sheriff at the door and leaving the diner. And here she had hoped the most she had to deal with was a pissed-off Natches. Now she had a pissed-off Natches, a mad Dawg, and a laughing Rowdy. Her day couldn\u2019t get worse.</p><p>Dawg sat back down in his chair and scowled at the door while Natches slowly took those damned glasses off and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch, I\u2019m going to kick your ass,\u201d Natches cursed.</p><p>Dawg sneered back at him. \u201cYeah right. Go right ahead. You think I didn\u2019t see your balls shrink when she gave you that cold little look? You ain\u2019t kickin\u2019 no one\u2019s ass today.\u201d</p><p>He was pissed. Pure pissed. Son of a bitch, she threatened to tell Crista on him? Like he was a little boy acting bad, and she was threatening to tell Mommy? How the hell old did that mouthy little agent think he was anyway? And he really wanted to beat Natches\u2019s ass, too. Snarky little upstart. He never could take advice worth a damn.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is your problem?\u201d Natches dug a few bills out of his pocket and slapped them on the table for the coffee. At least he was paying this morning instead of mooching off the rest of them. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you get the hell off her case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s lying to you,\u201d he snarled back, keeping his voice low, anger egging him on. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell she did to you in Iraq, and I\u2019m getting to where I don\u2019t give a damn. But right now, she\u2019s lying to you, and those lies could get you killed. And she\u2019s fucking plain.\u201d</p><p>Natches snapped back, blinked, and stared at Dawg as though he didn\u2019t know him. He glanced at Rowdy, but Rowdy seemed pretty interested in something he had found on the ceiling and refused to look over. Natches shook his head, as though befuddled.</p><p>Watching Natches, Dawg knew he was acting like a damned bastard, and he couldn\u2019t help it. Hell, he knew a lie when he saw it, and this whole setup Dane was involved in was a lie.</p><p>\u201cLook, Natches, man,\u201d he breathed out roughly. \u201cYou\u2019re getting in over your head. She\u2019s up to something; I can fucking feel it. Like an itch at the back of my neck every time I see her. She\u2019s trouble, and she\u2019s going to get your ass killed.\u201d</p><p>That was the problem. That gunsight between the eyes thing. Sometimes, Dawg swore he could feel someone with a gunsight between Natches\u2019s eyes, taking aim, getting ready to fire. And it was worrying the hell out of him.</p><p>\u201cRowdy, take him home to Crista,\u201d Natches said, his voice hard, and that was a bad thing. Natches might shoot him himself now. \u201cTell her he needs help fast. Before I kill him and make her a widow. Understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll get right on that.\u201d Rowdy nodded slowly, pulling his gaze from the ceiling to stare at both of them. \u201cWhile I\u2019m doing that, why don\u2019t one of you mosey over across the street and ask Aunt Nadine why the hell she\u2019s been watching us all so close through the window from that shop?\u201d</p><p>They turned. Across the street, in the wide shop window, stood Nadine, hatred flashing in her expression before she turned and stalked away.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Natches cursed. Just what he needed, the damned Mouth of the South running her vicious mouth now.</p><p>Dawg muttered something Natches was sure he didn\u2019t want to understand, and Rowdy stood slowly to his feet.</p><p>\u201cDawg\u2019s right about one thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s trouble here, and it\u2019s starting to circle around your Agent Dane. But he\u2019s wrong about something, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What?\u201d Natches snapped.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not plain. She\u2019s actually kinda pretty. Dawg just can\u2019t see past Crista. Or his own daddy complex.\u201d</p><p>With that, he walked away from the table and out of the diner. Natches sat back down slowly. He still wanted to kick Dawg\u2019s ass. He stared back at his cousin and scowled.</p><p>Dawg glanced out the window, to his coffee cup, then sighed. \u201cDo you really think she\u2019s gonna tell Crista about this?\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d be damned, but Dawg was worried.</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Winston. Thank you for agreeing to talk to me.\u201d Chaya sat down on a worn, faded couch inside the single-story weathered house on the outskirts of Somerset.</p><p>Clayton Winston was a widower, and his son was a traitor. His son, Christopher Winston, had been arrested along with the Swedish mercenary and his merry band of men during the raid on the warehouse containing the stolen missiles.</p><p>Mr. Winston was stooped, his face lined with grief and pain. Rheumatoid arthritis had a cruel grip on his joints, and heart disease was draining him fast.</p><p>Sheriff Mayes stood on the other side of the room, watching Winston silently, his expression compassionate, somber.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t raise Chris to be a traitor,\u201d the old man sniffed. \u201cHe\u2019s still my son, but he wasn\u2019t right to do that.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his grizzled cheek with a shaking hand before taking a handkerchief from his pants pocket and wiping his eyes. Those pale blue eyes were swimming with tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d offer you some coffee or something,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut the cold makes it harder to move in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the coffee, Clay.\u201d Mayes headed for the Spartan kitchen.</p><p>\u201cGood man, Sheriff Mayes.\u201d Clayton nodded. \u201cBetter than his daddy. His daddy was always more concerned with getting elected again than he was with doing what was right. Zeke knows that, too. He makes up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be talking about me, Clay,\u201d Zeke called from the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Miss Willa on you.\u201d</p><p>Clayton\u2019s smile was sad. \u201cI like to brag on the boy. He\u2019s a good boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff Mayes is a very kind man.\u201d Chaya nodded, her heart aching for the man sitting across from her.</p><p>Clayton Winston had served two tours in Vietnam. He had a medal for bravery and a file filled with commendations. Chaya\u2019s heart broke for him as she thought of the son that had turned his back on the life his father had believed in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou wanna talk about Christopher, I guess.\u201d His voice roughened. \u201cHow\u2019s he doin\u2019? They moved him to that place in D.C. where they said I could come visit if I wanted, but I wasn\u2019t able to go see him. And he can\u2019t take calls.\u201d He hunched his shoulders as despair flickered in his gaze.</p><p>Chaya\u2019s lips parted to answer him when a knock sounded on the door.</p><p>\u201cI got it, Clay.\u201d Zeke moved from the kitchen, casting Chaya an impatient look as he moved to the door.</p> <p>\u201cHey there, Zeke. Fancy seeing you here.\u201d Natches pushed past him and moved into the room. \u201cAnd Agent Dane. You\u2019re looking nice today.\u201d</p><p>Chaya rose slowly to her feet. \u201cNatches, you\u2019re not supposed to be here.\u201d</p><p>She had to speak between clenched teeth. She couldn\u2019t believe he had barged into this interview.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my fault.\u201d Clayton\u2019s shaking hands reached out to Natches as Natches knelt beside his worn recliner. \u201cI called him when gossip came around you was askin\u2019 questions. I asked him to be here.\u201d</p><p>Chaya\u2019s lips thinned. Sitting back down slowly, she glared at Natches. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mention that to me,\u201d she stated, her voice clipped.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t get a chance to discuss it. You left.\u201d The accusation in his voice had her breathing in deeply.</p><p>\u201cNatches can stay if that\u2019s your choice.\u201d She turned back to the old man, watching how he held on to Natches\u2019s hand with his gnarled fingers.</p><p>\u201cAnother good boy with a lousy sire.\u201d Clayton\u2019s voice trembled. \u201cI used to sneak him sweets when ole Dayle wasn\u2019t lookin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Chaya watched Natches\u2019s face, his eyes. This old man meant something to him, and there were few known people that Natches cared for.</p><p>\u201cNatches, get in here and help me with the coffee,\u201d Zeke snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the other room, Clay.\u201d Natches rose to his feet, staring down at the grizzled, gentle giant who watched him fondly. \u201cI\u2019ll hear every word. Okay?\u201d</p> <p>Clayton nodded as Natches threw Chaya a hard, warning look and moved back into the other room.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m going to accuse you of anything, Mr. Winston?\u201d she asked him softly. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>His lower lip trembled for the briefest second before he seemed to suck it back in and his shoulders squared.</p><p>\u201cChristopher\u2019s my boy. What he became, it\u2019s on my shoulders, Agent Dane. I realize that. But\u2014\u201d He lowered his head and shook it. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t think as clear as I used to. I asked Natches if he minded being here to make sure, if I was arrested, that my cat was taken care of.\u201d</p><p>The cat was curled along the back of the couch and blinked at her lazily. The cat looked as old as Clayton Winston, and as tired.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to arrest you, Mr. Winston, for no reason,\u201d Chaya told him gently. \u201cI\u2019m not here to accuse you of anything, because what your son did was his choice. You chose to defend your country, sir. Your son made other choices. I\u2019m trying to find out why he made those choices and who else may have influenced him there. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she watched as Zeke walked out with two cups. He sat Chaya\u2019s coffee cup on the table in front of her. The other, a closed thermal cup, he put in Clayton\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just good and warm, Clay. I put ice in it, just like you like.\u201d</p> <p>Clayton nodded, and Chaya\u2019s throat tightened with emotion. She couldn\u2019t remember an interview she had ever done that was quite like this one. Natches and Zeke were as protective over this old man as a mother with a child.</p><p>\u201cClayton, I told you Miss Dane would take good care of you,\u201d Natches told him from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d Clayton nodded. \u201cBut I feel better, Natches, with you and Zeke here. If she has to arrest me, then old Hisser here might go hungry; we can\u2019t have that.\u201d He reached up and stroked the cat\u2019s tail as it curled over his shoulder, and Chaya wanted to cry.</p><p>\u201cMr. Winston, I just have a few questions. If you prefer not to answer them, or if Mr. Mackay feels it\u2019s not in your best interests to answer them, then I want you to know now that there will be no repercussions. I\u2019m not here to see you hurt further. I merely need to clarify some things and make certain I didn\u2019t leave any loose strings.\u201d</p><p>Clayton nodded to that as he lifted his cup, both hands wrapped around it, and sipped from it.</p><p>This man, so patriotic and kind, was facing what had to be his greatest nightmare. The questions Cranston had given her weren\u2019t recriminating or accusatory. They were simple\u2014asking about Christopher\u2019s friends, if he was part of a hunting group, or if his friends were military. She asked him about his son\u2019s teen years, his friendships then. Strangely, he and Johnny Grace hadn\u2019t been friends. Yet he had ended up involved with Grace in the theft of those missiles.</p><p>\u201cChristopher was always preaching about America and politics and how all this nation lives for is money.\u201d Clayton shook his head wearily. \u201cSaid we needed a revolution to wake the people up. That boy, he never understood.\u201d A tear tracked down his cheek as he stared back at her. \u201cI lost friends and a brother in Vietnam. I was willing to give my life to provide this great nation for him, Agent Dane. Many, many great men shed their blood for my boy, and I never realized how little he appreciated that sacrifice. I raised him wrong. I should be in that cell.\u201d His chin wobbled. \u201cLocked away like that, and I can\u2019t even hear his voice, see if anything of my boy remains.\u201d Another tear fell as Natches moved forward and took the thermal cup before Clayton dropped it. \u201cI didn\u2019t teach him right,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>Chaya had to blink back her own tears. Ignoring Natches and Zeke, she reached out, covered the old man\u2019s hand, and waited until he could focus on her.</p><p>\u201cMr. Winston, your sacrifices and the sacrifices of your friends ensured his choice. What he did with that choice is on his shoulders, sir, not on yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe that?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI believe that with all my heart. You, sir, are, and have been, one of our nation\u2019s greatest assets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to arrest me?\u201d he asked then.</p><p>\u201cNot in a million years,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut I am going to arrange that phone call for you. I promise you that. I\u2019ll make sure you get to talk to your son.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t for the son, who she\u2019d just as soon see flayed alive. It was for the father. The soldier who had saved countless others, who had given all but his life for the freedom his son had never cherished.</p><p>Clayton blinked and his eyes filled with tears again. \u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d he whispered. \u201cJust for a minute. To hear my boy\u2019s voice.\u201d</p><p>She nodded to that and rose, making another promise to herself. When this was over, if he could make the trip, if he wanted the trip, she would make certain he got to see his son. And she would make damned sure that son showed him the respect this man deserved.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good girl, just like you said, Natches.\u201d Winston looked up at Natches, a shaky smile crossing his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t you let this one get away. She\u2019s tough enough to put up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she is, Clay.\u201d He gripped the other man\u2019s shoulder gently as he stared back at her, and she didn\u2019t want to feel the warmth that bloomed through her at that look. \u201cThat she is.\u201d</p><p>Chaya straightened and nodded, heading for the door.</p><p>\u201cAgent Dane.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to Clayton as Natches moved aside behind her.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, his rheumy eyes thoughtful as he rubbed at his whiskered chin. \u201cI just thought\u2014Christopher, he wasn\u2019t friends with Johnny a\u2019tall. Or that Bedsford fella. But he mentioned some friends once, called \u2019em by something. Called \u2019em his compatriots, said they were starting their own club or some such stuff. Freedom boys or something. I don\u2019t remember right off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you remember, could you contact me? Just let the sheriff know, and I\u2019ll come right over.\u201d</p><p>He nodded to that. \u201cI\u2019ll think on it. See what I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Mr. Winston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll remember to get that phone call for me?\u201d His voice was filled with hope. \u201cJust for a minute. Just so I can hear his voice one more time.\u201d</p><p>She was going to cry. Oh God, don\u2019t let her cry here, in front of this proud old man.</p><p>\u201cDepartment of Homeland Security will be contacting you tomorrow, Mr. Winston. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, reached for his coffee cup, and brought it to his shaking lips. She wanted to howl at the unfairness of it, and she couldn\u2019t. All she could do was walk out the door and move to the sheriff\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stick around and make sure Clay gets dinner.\u201d Natches caught her arm and pulled her to a stop. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell. Tonight, Chay, and that\u2019s final. I didn\u2019t know Miss Willa wasn\u2019t coming over here every evening to take care of Clay\u2019s dinner, and I have to fix that now. But you can bet on the fact you will be seeing me this evening.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him and followed Zeke to his car, getting in and slamming the door behind her as she continued to fight her tears. She would rather interrogate a roomful of terrorists than ever have to face that old man with so much as one more question regarding his son.</p><p>She was losing it. There was a time when she could have questioned him and pushed back her sympathy, her compassion. It was what she had been trained to do. She was an interrogation specialist. She knew how to do her job without worrying about the consequences.</p><p>At least, she used to know how.</p><p>\u201cOne more to go,\u201d Zeke said as he got in the car and looked over at her. \u201cI believe it\u2019s the widowed mother of another of those boys.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. A man who had paid his mother\u2019s bills, bought her food, and took care of her, and now his mother was suffering.</p><p>Her fingers curled into a fist, and fury spiked hard and hot inside her.</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re finished for the day.\u201d</p><p>Zeke paused as he slid the car into gear. \u201cIt won\u2019t be any easier tomorrow, Agent Dane. Trust me, I can tell you that one for a fact.\u201d</p><p>She stared out the window, ignoring her own reflection, afraid of what she might see. She knew tomorrow wouldn\u2019t be any easier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve interrogated dozens of terrorists. I\u2019ve interrogated suspects\u2019 families. I\u2019ve been a bitch and remembered what I was fighting for, for years now.\u201d She was twenty-eight years old. She had come into Army Intelligence right after boot camp and worked her way up. She knew what she was doing, she knew how to do it, and she couldn\u2019t stand the thought of one more parent forced to face the choices his child had made.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I hear you\u2019re real good at your job,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d she whispered, refusing to look at him as he pulled out of the driveway.</p><p>The yard around the Winston house was overgrown. Clayton Winston\u2019s only son used to keep it mowed and trimmed. The trees needed trimming, and there was no one to do that now.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you didn\u2019t make the choices those boys made any more than Clay did,\u201d Zeke told her as they headed away from the house. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to stop them, your job to make sure we stop all of them. It might hurt like hell; it might cut us up until nothing helps but a shot of whiskey and a tear or two. But we do what we have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor as long as we can stand to do it,\u201d she said softly. \u201cTake me back to my car, Sheriff. I told you; I\u2019m finished for the day.\u201d</p><p>She returned to her hotel and ordered a bottle of wine. She showered and changed into a robe and curled up on the couch, where she put in a call to Cranston. Two hours later, suffering the effects of a furious, heated argument over the phone call she had promised Clayton Winston, she\u2019d arranged it. At noon the next day, he would have ten minutes with his son. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bastard. Christopher didn\u2019t deserve to hear his father\u2019s voice. Didn\u2019t deserve to know that the man who had lost a brother and countless friends in the service of his country still loved him.</p><p>It would bring Christopher Winston more comfort than it would bring his father, but even a small amount of comfort was reason enough.</p><p>And what of the widow? she asked herself. What was she going to promise her? What about the wife and two small children of another man they had taken? A man with a promising career, who had laid it all on the line to betray his country.</p> <p>She pushed her fingers through her hair and fought the scream welling in her throat. What about those children who had lost their daddy and didn\u2019t understand why? The wife whose eyes were haunted in the surveillance pictures, who hid in her home and tried to ignore the gossip swirling in this small town?</p><p>She rose to her feet and paced to the window. She stared out at the darkness falling over the mountains, the lights of the city around her, and she could feel the tears inside her.</p><p>When had she ever cared before? The men they had arrested had made their own decisions, yet she was beating herself up over the fact that she had to question their families.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t those men facing the consequences of what they had done to their families, staring into their haunted eyes. It was her. Her and the people who had loved them.</p><p>As she stood there, she heard the door to the suite open. Through the reflection in the glass, she watched as Natches entered the room, and she had to clench her teeth to hold back a sob.</p> <p>His expression was somber as he crossed the room, his gaze dark, concerned.</p><p>She expected him to castigate her for questioning Clayton Winston. For making his pain worse. Instead, she was shocked as he came to her and turned her against his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to cry, Chay,\u201d he whispered at her ear. \u201cClayton wouldn\u2019t think less of you for it. And neither would I.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, but she felt the tears building in her chest. Crying didn\u2019t help. It wouldn\u2019t bring back Clayton Winston\u2019s pride in his son, and it wouldn\u2019t ease the pain of a widowed mother or a family damaged by betrayal.</p><p>This beautiful town. These people that she had somehow let into her heart right along with Natches were tearing her apart.</p><p>\u201cHe deserved better,\u201d she whispered, holding on to Natches, desperate to find some way now to control the emotions she didn\u2019t know how to handle. \u201cThis is why I hate you,\u201d she cried out. \u201cI get around you, and I start feeling. I start laughing over two nitwits who broke into your apartment because they thought I was going to somehow hurt you. I cry over old men who deserved better but are a whole lot better off knowing the truth. And I start aching for things I never needed before. I hate you for this.\u201d</p> <p>She was shaking in his arms, felt them tighten around her as she dug her nails into his back and held on for dear life.</p><p>\u201cYou love me, Chay,\u201d he whispered against her hair, his voice quiet and deep. Secure. Damn him, he was always so secure, always so confident, and at this moment she felt as though she was struggling just to hold on to reality.</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel too much,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMake it stop, Natches.\u201d</p><p>Make the pain go away.</p><p>She shook her head against his chest and jerked away from him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d She had done that to him once before, asked him to take away the pain. She had never forgotten the way he had looked at her. The regret in his eyes, the sorrow. Because it wasn\u2019t him she was asking for; it was solace.</p><p>\u201cChay, come back here.\u201d He pulled her back to him, one hand holding her head to his chest as his arm wrapped around her. \u201cDo you think I mind being your shield against the world, or the pain?\u201d He tipped her head back, forced her to look at him, and her vision blurred with tears. \u201cSweetheart, my shoulders are broad enough for your tears, your fists, or those sharp little teeth. However you need to hold on to me. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Her voice shook now, almost as badly as Clayton Winston\u2019s had trembled earlier. \u201cAlways a shield and never shielded, Natches?\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled at that, his gaze gentle. \u201cIs that what you think?\u201d He touched her cheek, ran his thumb over her lips. \u201cThat I have no shield? Don\u2019t you know, Chay? You\u2019ve been my shield since the day I met you, whether you were here or not. The memory of your laughter, your tears, the memory of your touch and your kiss. You changed me, Chay, and I think it\u2019s only fair that I\u2019m changing you as well.\u201d</p><p>Changing her, and that change was destroying her. Before he could say anything more, before the tears welling inside her could fall, she reached up, grabbed his head, and fought for his kiss.</p><p>She needed this. She needed to feel him burning inside her, just one more time, because she could feel parts of herself unraveling that she didn\u2019t know how to handle.</p><p>She was being attacked by emotions she had promised herself since she was a girl she would never feel. All her life, she had maintained distance, but distance wasn\u2019t possible with Natches.</p><p>He lifted her off her feet as his lips controlled the kiss despite her battle to lead it. He chuckled at her attempts to nip his lips, and nipped hers in turn. He slanted his lips over hers, pushed his tongue inside, and lit a fire in her that she knew would burn her to ashes.</p><p>She was tearing at his clothes as he laid her on the bed and stripped her of her robe. She couldn\u2019t get him undressed fast enough.</p><p>She fought him as he wrestled her to the bed, his lips and tongue burning over one nipple, then the other. He sucked one into his mouth, lashed at it with heated licks of his tongue, and filled her with passion.</p><p>She had never known passion until Natches. She had never known this heat, this fire that became a void of loneliness and loss when she walked away from him.</p><p>How had she ever walked away?</p><p>She twisted beneath him, gasping, crying his name.</p><p>\u201cI need . . .\u201d She arched as his teeth raked the hardened peak, and he growled against it. \u201cI need you, Natches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, Chay.\u201d His voice was deep, rough. It grated across her senses and made the pleasure deeper, hotter. Because she knew he felt it. Knew he was as lost in it as she was.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d Her head tossed against the mattress as he held her in place, his lips sipping at her flesh, his tongue licking it. \u201cDon\u2019t make me wait.\u201d</p><p>His hand cupped between her thighs, heated, calloused flesh meeting swollen, wet folds.</p><p>She arched and cried out as two fingers thrust inside her, throwing her higher, deeper into the maelstrom overtaking her.</p><p>And she let it have her. She let him have her. She arched, pulling at his shoulders, feeling him come to her. Thick and hard, his erection worked inside her, stretching her, easing her, building sensation and emotion into a kaleidoscope of color and pleasure.</p><p>When he was buried to the hilt, his breath rasping, his expressiontwisted in lines of hunger, she felt his desperation to meld with her inside her very pores.</p><p>\u201cHold on to me, sweetheart.\u201d He shifted and knelt in front of her, gripping her hips and pulling her to him until her rear rested on his thighs, his cock buried full length inside her.</p><p>Her hands grabbed his wrists as his smile, strained with need, seared into her brain.</p><p>\u201cYou hold on tight now,\u201d he crooned. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you scream.\u201d</p><p>He braced his hands beside her on the bed as her legs curled around his hips. And he began to move. Hard, driving thrusts that buried his flesh inside of her. Again. Again. Sending lightning crashing across her nerve endings, fire building in her womb.</p><p>She held on and, as he promised, she screamed. She exploded around him, her back bending, her hands gripping his wrists, and heard his cry echoing around her. Heated warmth filled her as he began to ejaculate, deep, fierce throbs of his release sending her arching into more pleasure.</p><p>He destroyed her. And he remade her. And when the final tremors eased, he pulled her into his arms as a tear fell from her eye. Just one tear, she told herself. She could afford to shed just one.</p><p>And that one tear seemed to last forever.</p><p>NINE</p><p>Rebuilding her defenses against Natches wasn\u2019t going to work. He bullied her into returning to the houseboat for dinner with him, then he made certain she was too exhausted to return to her hotel that night.</p><p>She fell asleep in his arms, drained emotionally and physically, and knowing that if she wasn\u2019t very careful, Natches Mackay could destroy her.</p><p>The next morning, as she had the morning before, she slipped out of his bed and off the boat. Her cab was waiting at the marina office, and as she opened the back door and glanced behind her, she saw him. Standing on the top deck of the Nauti Dreams, fog whispering around him, his chest bare. She wondered for a second why she bothered to try to run. And why it was so damned hard to face him after the wild loving he gave her.</p><p>It was a problem that followed her through the day, just as Natches followed her from one interview to another.</p><p>The first two interviews didn\u2019t matter. They were surface tests, no more. Former friends of Johnny Grace who had already been cleared in the investigation. But she had to make it look good. Timothy had an idea of who was of major concern, and as the day progressed, Chaya became more nervous over that particular interview.</p><p>Because Natches was following them in his black jeep, watching her, always there.</p><p>As they pulled into the driveway of Nadine Grace\u2019s home at about three o\u2019clock that afternoon, Chaya felt like drying her sweating palms on her jeans before getting out of the car.</p><p>\u201cYou sure about this?\u201d Sheriff Mayes stared at the house, his expression concerned, before glancing at her. \u201cJohnny was her son. The only person in this town she really liked. She\u2019s not going to be polite.\u201d</p><p>Oh, there was someone else in town Nadine had liked, and the thought of it sickened Chaya.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to win a popularity contest, Sheriff,\u201d she told him as she gripped her briefcase and opened the car door. \u201cI\u2019m just here to get answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd rile the Mackay cousins up?\u201d he asked as he exited the vehicle. \u201cI ain\u2019t seen those two as pissed off at each other as they were yesterday morning in years. I\u2019ll end up having to lock them up tonight if they get into a public brawl.\u201d</p><p>She flicked him a disagreeable look. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know this? They nearly tore up that diner about two years ago or so. I had them in a cell for a weekend, and trust me, that\u2019s not pleasant.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cTo start with, Dawg\u2019s not going to risk making his wife that angry. And Natches wasn\u2019t nearly mad enough to fight yet. Dawg won\u2019t push him that far either.\u201d</p><p>Mayes shot her a disbelieving look but didn\u2019t say anything more as the front door jerked open.</p><p>\u201cZeke. That\u2019s a Mackay whore, and I don\u2019t want her on my property.\u201d Nadine Grace\u2019s pretty face was twisted in fury, her green eyes blazing with rage. \u201cGet her out of here.\u201d</p><p>Slender, still attractive at fifty, and filled with anger, the other woman glared daggers at Chaya.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could, Mrs. Grace.\u201d Zeke sighed, glancing at Chaya as she stared back at the other woman coolly.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Grace, I\u2019m Agent Greta Dane, Department of Homeland Security.\u201d She pulled her badge folder from her jacket and flashed the ID at the other woman. \u201cMackay whore isn\u2019t my title today. Catch me tonight though, and you might hit it right.\u201d</p><p>Nadine\u2019s nostrils flared as though picking up a disgusting scent. \u201cGet off my property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff,\u201d Chaya said to Mayes. \u201cPlease have Mrs. Grace detained and brought to your office. We\u2019ll change this from an interview to an interrogation. I\u2019ll call the main office and apprise them of the situation.\u201d She didn\u2019t take her eyes off Nadine Grace.</p><p>\u201cNow, Agent Dane, we don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d He sighed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course we do.\u201d She smiled tightly. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t want to cooperate, then I don\u2019t have to be nice. Do I?\u201d</p><p>The other woman was nearly shaking with rage now. Her gaze was spitting fury, her face pale with it.</p><p>\u201cNadine, just a few minutes of your time, and then we can leave,\u201d Sheriff Mayes assured her. \u201cAgent Dane has a few questions. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>The woman was going to crack her jaw, she was clenching it so hard.</p><p>\u201cYou have ten minutes.\u201d She turned away from the door, her dark blue dress swishing about her legs as she stalked into the house.</p><p>Chaya stepped inside, instantly shivering at the stark white walls and furniture. The place looked like an ice cave, there was so much white.</p><p>\u201cTake your damned shoes off,\u201d Nadine snapped, glaring at them from the living room as she took a seat on the white sofa.</p><p>Chaya glanced at the sheriff before putting her briefcase down and tugging off her boots. Mayes followed suit, but clearly didn\u2019t like it.</p> <p>She padded into the living room and took the chair facing Nadine as she pulled a recorder from her case and laid it on her knee. Nadine spared a look at the small device, her lips curling into a sneer.</p><p>Chaya turned it on, stated the date and time.</p><p>\u201cFor the record, you\u2019re Nadine Mackay Grace, mother to Johnny Grace,\u201d she stated, then stared back at Nadine.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Grace, were you aware, at the time, that your son, Johnathon Ralph Grace, was involved in terrorist activities?\u201d</p><p>Nadine\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cHe was not. Johnny wasn\u2019t involved in anything of the sort.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s clear evidence that he not only masterminded the theft of several government missiles and guidance chips, but he also murdered the driver transporting those missiles. He contracted and brokered the sale of those missiles. He shot and killed Jim Bedsford, his lover and partner, and attempted to kill Crista Jansen. Were you aware of those activities before or during the time they were taking place?\u201d</p><p>Nadine was breathing roughly, her fists clenched on her knees, her face splotching with a furious flush. She wasn\u2019t nearly as pretty now as she had been when they had entered the house.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to answer these ridiculous questions,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>\u201cWe can answer them here, or we can answer them under more formal settings,\u201d Chaya told the other woman. \u201cIf you would like to contact your lawyer, we can Mirandize you and take you into the sheriff\u2019s office for interrogation. Why waste time, Mrs. Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son did none of that,\u201d Nadine retorted, her voice harsh. \u201cThose cousins of his, they did it all and they framed him. Those bastards made it look like he did it so they could kill him.\u201d</p><p>And Nadine knew better. She was lying through her teeth. Chaya stared back at her silently, her eyes holding the other woman\u2019s for long seconds before Nadine looked away and pretended to blink back tears.</p><p>What was she lying about though?</p><p>\u201cMrs. Grace, were you aware of the theft of those missiles at any time before your son was killed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook with fury as she answered the question, but once again, she couldn\u2019t hold Chaya\u2019s gaze. She turned to the sheriff. \u201cIsn\u2019t this enough yet?\u201d</p><p>Chaya ignored Mayes and continued to stare at Nadine until the other woman glanced back at her.</p><p>\u201cDid Johnny tell you where the money he gained on deposit of those missiles was hidden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Like an animal, Nadine\u2019s lips curled back from her teeth and her eyes glittered with malicious glee.</p><p>\u201cWho would he have told?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. He didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying the Mackay cousins framed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happened.\u201d Nadine\u2019s teeth snapped together.</p><p>\u201cWhy would they do that, Mrs. Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey always hated Johnny. He was always smarter; he always did what was right. They hated him for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas James Dawg Mackay aware Johnny was also the biological son of his father, your brother Chandler Mackay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d Nadine nearly screamed the word, hatred burning hard and bright in her eyes.</p><p>Chaya watched her carefully now. \u201cMrs. Grace, we have a recorded statement of your son bragging about those crimes. Just as he admitted to being the son of Chandler Mackay, your deceased brother. DNA testing from blood collected after his death and compared to James Mackay\u2019s, proves this to be the case. Are you stating, for the record, that your son was not conceived in an incestuous relationship between yourself and your deceased brother, Chandler Mackay?\u201d</p><p>This was the part Chaya hated. The part she had argued and fought Cranston over for days before leaving for Somerset.</p><p>Nadine was silent. She drew in a hard, deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI want to call my lawyer now,\u201d she stated.</p><p>Chaya flipped off the recorder and placed it back in her briefcase before standing. Sheriff Mayes followed suit, his expression granite hard as he glanced at Nadine Grace, then to Chaya.</p><p>\u201cYou do that, Mrs. Grace,\u201d Chaya told her softly. \u201cAnd when you do, perhaps you had better warn him to advise you on your rights should you lie under oath. Because the next time we question you, you will be under oath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be a next time,\u201d Nadine spat back at her.</p><p>Chaya smiled and walked back to the front door, where she put her boots back on before straightening and staring back at the other woman.</p><p>\u201cThere will be a next time, Mrs. Grace. I\u2019d contact that lawyer if I were you. You\u2019re going to need him.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t give the other woman time to protest but stepped out of the house and moved toward the sheriff\u2019s cruiser. Natches was still sitting on the other side of the street, staring at her, his expression hard but thoughtful as she and the sheriff got back into the cruiser.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to tell me what the hell was going on in there?\u201d Sheriff Mayes asked her carefully, coldly. \u201cNo matter what he did, Agent Dane, she was still his mother. And you showed no respect for that.\u201d</p><p>No, she hadn\u2019t, and it didn\u2019t sit well with her, but she knew Timothy\u2019s suspicions and she knew the evidence he had amassed so far. At this point, she couldn\u2019t afford to worry about respect.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, Sheriff, we all have to do things we don\u2019t particularly like, as you reminded me yesterday,\u201d she finally answered, glancing at him as he reversed out of the driveway and passed Natches\u2019s jeep. \u201cHave you ever had to arrest a friend? Did the fact that he was your friend sway you from your sworn duty to arrest him?\u201d</p><p>He spared her a brief, flinty glance. \u201cNo, it did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that she\u2019s a mother can\u2019t sway me from mine, and there\u2019s a difference between her and Clayton Winston,\u201d she informed him. \u201cJohnny Grace killed an innocent soldier, stole those missiles and their guidance chips, and negotiated a rather low price for them. The money is missing, and pertinent information regarding the whole deal is missing. He had another partner. Nadine Grace was lying for her son; Clayton Winston didn\u2019t. And I want to know what she was lying about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think it was his mother helping him?\u201d He clearly didn\u2019t think it was, but then neither did she.</p><p>\u201cWhat I think doesn\u2019t matter. I have a clear set of questions for each person I\u2019m interviewing. Those recordings will be transferred to DHS, where they will be gone over by the experts there and determinations made as to who will be pulled into formal interrogation. DHS won\u2019t let this go.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Mayes wasn\u2019t stupid. He wasn\u2019t letting it go either, but he clearly wasn\u2019t saying anything more.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s next on your little list then?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cWenden Frakes,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he breathed out. \u201cJohnny\u2019s uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRalph Grace\u2019s half brother.\u201d She nodded.</p><p>\u201cJust what I need,\u201d he growled as he made another turn and hit the interstate. \u201cWenden Frakes pissed off. That\u2019s just gonna round out my day.\u201d</p><p>Wenden Frakes wasn\u2019t pissed off. And he didn\u2019t end up pissed off. He was feeding cattle when they arrived and agreed to talk to them after a careful silence.</p><p>His answers were cautiously worded, his expression disagreeable, but he didn\u2019t give them any trouble. Didn\u2019t like that little bastard Johnny, he declared. Everyone knew he was Chandler Mackay\u2019s kid because everyone knew Nadine Grace was doing the nasty with her brothers. Not just one brother, he stated, but both Chandler and Dayle Mackay.</p><p>When they left the Frakes farm, the sheriff heaved a hard sigh. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the Mackay Marina, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Chaya almost felt sick inside. \u201cI don\u2019t have a choice, Sheriff.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Mayes shook his head. \u201cI sure hope you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t. She only knew the list, the questions, and the vague sense of disquiet slowly stealing over her. Timothy had plotted out each person to question and the order of the interviews. He knew something; he was pushing someone, and she just couldn\u2019t figure out whom. She knew she was growing more and more concerned though. And by the look Natches had flashed them as they passed him, he was growing angrier with each visit they made today.</p><p>As the sheriff turned into the Mackay Marina, Chaya drew in a slow, control-restoring breath. Natches had guessed where they were headed, too, because there was Rowdy Mackay at the front of the marina office, his wife standing beside him.</p><p>They watched as she and the sheriff stepped from the car and Natches drew the jeep into the parking space beside them. Chaya paused. She had no intention of fighting him over this one.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Chaya?\u201d His voice was harder now, suspicious.</p><p>\u201cMy job.\u201d Turning to him, she tried to push past the ache in her chest as she saw the suspicion in his eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re just questions, Natches. That\u2019s all. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClarifications. Making certain DHS has everything. Timothy isn\u2019t targeting Ray Mackay; I can promise you that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he targeting?\u201d Ice formed in his tone.</p><p>She shook her head, aware of the sheriff watching them in interest. \u201cI don\u2019t know. All I have are the questions. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for a long moment. His arms crossed over his chest as he glanced to the marina, then back to her. \u201cJust questions? Or accusations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuestions, Natches. And the questions aren\u2019t in the least accusatory.\u201d</p><p>He glanced to the marina office again, and she followed his gaze. Ray Mackay stepped outside, his broad form powerful, his gaze piercing, and his expression confident. Everything about him the same as she remembered from the year before. This was the man who had practically raised Natches, the man who had sheltered him through what had obviously been a hell of a childhood.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man,\u201d she said softly, turning back to the angry man watching her. \u201cI would never take that from him. And I wouldn\u2019t let Cranston do it either\u2014not without warning you first. Not without fighting him every breath of the way.\u201d</p><p>He finally nodded, his arms uncrossing before his fingers curved around her arm and he walked her to the marina.</p><p>\u201cYou young fools.\u201d As they reached him on the stoop, Ray shook his head before smiling back at Chaya. \u201cNadine\u2019s done called everyone in the county, spitting out poison. I figured you\u2019d be here sometime today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Mackay.\u201d She extended her hand in greeting, pleased when he took it in a firm grip. \u201cI just have a few questions if I may. Alone, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance in hell,\u201d Rowdy objected. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSon, I don\u2019t need you watching my back.\u201d Ray glared back at his son with fatherly reproof. \u201cPut your back down, and keep Natches and the sheriff here company. Me and Miss Dane here will just have a little chat in the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Dad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t curse in front of the women. I taught you better than that.\u201d Ray glared back at him before turning to Chaya and inviting her into the marina office. \u201cCome on in, Agent Dane. These boys can stand out here in the sun and let off some steam while we talk. It\u2019s the best thing for them.\u201d</p><p>She liked him. She had liked him the year before, the few times she had seen him. He was protective of his son and his nephews. He had protected them as well as he could when they were children, and he continued to do so after they were grown.</p> <p>Ray Mackay, for all intents and purposes, didn\u2019t have just one son, he had three.</p><p>\u201cRight back here.\u201d He opened the office door as his wife stood by worriedly. \u201cMaria just made fresh coffee. Would you like some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thank you.\u201d She felt like slime as she took the seat he offered her and waited as he closed the door and moved behind his desk.</p><p>Then he was staring back at her with too-perceptive blue eyes and a concerned expression. \u201cYou\u2019re sure making a mess of my boys.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI heard Dawg and Natches almost came to blows at the diner yesterday. And Natches is fit to be tied right now.\u201d</p><p>Chaya nodded. \u201cI know. It couldn\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p> <p>Ray Mackay was what Chaya had always thought a father should be. At fifty-nine, he was trim, his hair black and silver, his face weathered. And kind. He had a kind face, and that just made her feel worse.</p><p>She pulled the recording device from her briefcase hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cI need to record this,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He nodded in agreement.</p><p>She turned the machine on, stated the date and time, and looked up at him. \u201cYour name is Raymond Douglas Mackay. You were Johnny Grace\u2019s uncle. Brother to his mother as well as to Chandler Mackay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He nodded.</p> <p>She swallowed tightly. \u201cWere you at any time aware of Johnny Grace\u2019s illegal activities here in Somerset or outside the county?\u201d She watched his eyes, and he didn\u2019t turn from her, didn\u2019t flinch.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am, I didn\u2019t know Johnny was capable of such activities.\u201d</p><p>She nodded to that.</p><p>\u201cMr. Mackay, as stated by Johnny Grace, he\u2019s the half brother to his cousin James Mackay. A product of the incestuous relationship between his mother and her brother Chandler Mackay. Did you know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspected a time or two,\u201d he said softly. \u201cMy brothers and sister weren\u2019t my concern after I left my mother\u2019s home, Agent Dane. I lived my life, and I stayed out of theirs.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>\u201cWould his mother be capable of aiding him in those illegal activities?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cHis mother would have aided the devil himself if it meant destroying Dawg. If it meant destroying any of those boys outside there. She hated them. Even more than Dawg\u2019s and Natches\u2019s fathers hated them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas she also sleeping with her brother Dayle Mackay? Would he have aided her and/or her son in those activities?\u201d</p><p>Ray stared back at her silently for long moments. \u201cI\u2019d like to say no,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I learned with Johnny that nothing is impossible. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t know, Agent Dane. Dayle\u2019s ex-Marine, always seemed damned patriotic to me. He preaches about it, argues politics, and votes in every election. Hates foreigners, and my first thought would be he\u2019d never betray his country. But after Johnny . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWhat the hell do I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a million dollars in cash missing, and connections Johnny or Jim Bedsford couldn\u2019t have had aided in the near sale of those missiles, Mr. Mackay. Who would have helped him?\u201d</p><p>Ray scratched his cheek as he thought, then finally shook his head. \u201cI just don\u2019t know. Things like this don\u2019t happen around here, Agent Dane. Somerset is a quiet little town, and this whole thing . . .\u201d He shook his head again. \u201cIt\u2019s spooked a lot of folks. Hell, I think it spooked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWenden Frakes, Ralph Grace\u2019s half brother, says Johnny spent a lot of time on the lake last summer. Did he use any of the boats off your marina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one of my mine.\u201d He shook his head firmly. \u201cI didn\u2019t let Johnny Grace rent out my boats for no reason. He had a tendency to tear them up. Those boats are hard to replace. Besides, Dayle had a boat he kept out at his cabin farther up the lake. Johnny used it some, I think.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again and flipped off the recorder. She had what she needed here.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Mackay,\u201d she said when he stared back at her in surprise. \u201cI know the questions weren\u2019t comfortable, and I apologize for that. They weren\u2019t questions I chose; I want you to know that.\u201d</p><p>Ray leaned back in his chair then and watched her with the narrow-eyed intent of a man who knew people and, sometimes, knew them too well.</p><p>\u201cDawg says you\u2019re cold,\u201d he stated then, surprising her. \u201cThat you\u2019re just using Natches for whatever DHS has going on here. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>Chaya slid the recorder back in her case before lifting her eyes to Ray. She let him hold her gaze, just as he had allowed her to hold his. \u201cNatches is my weakness, Mr. Mackay,\u201d she finally admitted. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t take no for an answer sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer my question,\u201d he said, his voice gentle as he smiled back at her. \u201cAre you using my nephew, Agent Dane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mr. Mackay. I\u2019m trying to protect your nephew.\u201d</p><p>And to that, he nodded slowly. \u201cAnd I believe you. Now I think you have some bridges to repair outside. Rowdy\u2019s got a slow burn. He doesn\u2019t do mad easy, but he\u2019s getting close to mad. Dawg is ready to fight. And Natches will stand between them and you, but I\u2019d hate to see that happen. Fix it, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to do that how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy being honest, Miss Dane. As honest as you can be. Those three boys ain\u2019t no one\u2019s dummies, no matter what that Cranston fellow wants to think. And after today, they\u2019re going to block you unless you\u2019re smart enough to work with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if that threatens Natches?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cThen now\u2019s the time to warn him.\u201d He rose from his seat and watched her with that fatherly look that demanded action. The right action. \u201cLet him help you, Miss Dane. You\u2019d be amazed how easy he can be to get along with then.\u201d</p><p>And he was right. She couldn\u2019t tell them the truth, because even she didn\u2019t know the whole truth. But she could tell them enough to perhaps get them to back down. Because they had to back down, just for a little while longer.</p><p>He stared at the caller ID on the phone before answering it, his jaw clenching in anger.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were here.\u201d Nadine\u2019s voice was shaking with fury. \u201cWe have to do something now.\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cSettle down. Now\u2019s not the time to do anything, peanut. We sit back and let her ask her questions. She can\u2019t hurt us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows something,\u201d Nadine hissed. \u201cI could tell. And she\u2019ll get what she needs. If she finds out, she\u2019ll fry us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t calm down, you\u2019ll fry us. You don\u2019t know anything, remember that. Johnny was a good boy and you\u2019re his mother. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey recorded Johnny bragging about belonging to Chandler. They did DNA tests. That bastard Dawg gave them blood and they matched it. They know it\u2019s the truth. If they keep digging, they\u2019ll find the connection.\u201d</p><p>Now that piece of information was worrisome. He hadn\u2019t expected that. He\u2019d managed to keep that information buried for too many years, he didn\u2019t like it coming out now. Didn\u2019t it just figure that Johnny had to brag? As though it were something to brag over.</p><p>\u201cThe connection is hidden, peanut. Take one of your pills and calm down. As soon as I can I\u2019ll be there and we\u2019ll talk. We\u2019ll figure this out. Until then, remember, they can\u2019t get anything unless you tell them.\u201d He hoped.</p><p>\u201cDo something,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou have to do something before they question anyone else. They\u2019ve already been to Wenden\u2019s and Ray\u2019s. If they keep digging, they could dig up something else.\u201d</p><p>If Johnny had revealed the truth about Chandler, God only knew what else he had let out. He grimaced at the thought of that. Hell, he had thought Johnny was smarter than that. He hated being wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there as soon as I can,\u201d he promised her again. \u201cIf they show up again, don\u2019t answer the door. Pretend you aren\u2019t home. I\u2019ll check into things and I\u2019ll have something when I get there.\u201d</p><p>He heard her breathing, heard the little sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cWill you stay the night this time?\u201d she asked then, that little whisper of hope bringing a smile to his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to arrange it. I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m coming. Promise you\u2019ll stay calm, peanut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise. Until you get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I get there.\u201d</p><p>He disconnected the phone, tapped his finger against it thoughtfully and began to make plans. It was sooner than he liked, but it was time to start cleaning things up.</p><p>TEN</p><p>Natches caught her as she came out of the marina office. His fingers latched around her arm and before she could do more than breathe a protest he began dragging her toward the Nauti Dreams.</p><p>He had no idea what the hell was going on here, but he was getting ready to find out. She wanted to question the rest of the damned town, that was fine and dandy by him, but when she started questioning family, then he expected answers.</p><p>And when she started dealing with that rattler Nadine, then he sure as hell expected those answers to be forthcoming.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like being dragged around like a child, Natches,\u201d she told him as he pulled her onto the deck of the boat and unlocked the door.</p><p>He pulled her into the houseboat, slammed the sliding door closed behind him, then stalked to the kitchen for a beer.</p><p>All shit aside, he\u2019d seen a new side of Chaya today. For the first time, this morning, he\u2019d seen the agent. Steel eyed, her demeanor cold, she refused to back down. And rather than turning him off as it should have, it had made him hard. Because he knew the woman underneath, liquid hot and burning for him alone. Dawg called her plain, and he\u2019d wanted to smash his cousin\u2019s face in for the comment despite the fact that he knew, had seen, the metamorphosis she somehow managed to undergo.</p><p>The agent, with her hair slicked back into a ponytail, her eyes cold and hard, her expression emotionless, blended into the background for most people. Not plain, but easily passed by for some reason. Natches had always seen the woman beneath that look though, because he knew her, in all her expressions, in many of her moods, and he knew there was nothing plain about her.</p><p>She was complex, complicated, and sometimes too damned sharp to suit him. And she was good at hiding. Hiding herself as well as her secrets.</p><p>He turned back to her after downing half the bottle of beer he\u2019d pulled from the refrigerator, remaining silent as he watched her.</p><p>Dressed in jeans because she knew they made folks more comfortable and a light sweater beneath a dark blazer. And those boots. Those boots made her legs look longer, made them sexier. The gray sweater brought the soft golden highlights in her eyes free, and softened her delicate face.</p><p>And when she crossed her arms over her breasts and glared back at him, his cock throbbed in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cThe Mackays are going to have to keep their noses out of this,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou and Dawg following me around town all day, then showing up here. What the hell did you think I was going to do anyway? For God\u2019s sake, Natches, you know how an investigation works. There are questions afterward, loose ends to tie up and, considering there\u2019s a million dollars missing and possible co-conspirators, facts to find. You don\u2019t just drop a case like this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t say anything. He finished the beer, tossed it in the trash and narrowed his eyes on her once again.</p><p>And it infuriated her. He could see the mad rising in her eyes. The distant expression he referred to as her \u201cagent face\u201d began to peel away. A light flush worked over her cheeks, her lips lost that thin, cool little line and the lower curve became almost lush, definitely sensual.</p><p>Here came his Chaya, the woman.</p> <p>\u201cTimothy\u2019s playing a very neat little game,\u201d he said then. \u201cI can see it in every move you\u2019re making and I know you can, too. He gave you orders I\u2019m not to accompany you on these interviews? Have you asked yourself why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because you\u2019re too damned nosy and you don\u2019t know how to stand down,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He almost grinned at the accusation.</p><p>\u201cBecause he knows he\u2019s going to be poking in my business,\u201d he informed her. \u201cWhatever the hell he has going on here is going to piss me off and he doesn\u2019t want me to know about it until he has no other choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis does not concern Ray Mackay, Natches,\u201d she told him again, and he saw the truth in her, felt it. \u201cAre you going to go off the deep end when I question Dawg? Rowdy? What about Crista Mackay? Are the Mackay cousins going to close rank against me then?\u201d</p> <p>He paused and stared back at her. Is that what she really expected? That he would side with his cousins, with anyone, against her? Hell, he had risked his damned hide for her in Iraq, not just once but twice. Did she think he would do any less for her here?</p><p>\u201cI have a job to do, Natches. I don\u2019t have the option you chose last year of telling Timothy Cranston to get fucked. And to be honest, this time, I don\u2019t want that option. I want to know who the hell thought they could get away with murdering that kid that drove the transport vehicle. I want to know how Johnny Grace got away with nearly killing Dawg\u2019s woman. And I want to know why the hell this little town is suddenly a beehive of terrorist activity.\u201d</p><p>His brows almost arched at that statement. The last year, he and Dawg had admittedly been concentrating on their own lives. Had they somehow managed to miss something going on that they should have seen?</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen many terrorists this week, Chay,\u201d he finally stated, tilting his head and watching her curiously. \u201cIs there something here that I should know?\u201d</p><p>She inhaled slowly. \u201cLast year you had nearly a dozen terrorists near or around Somerset. The Swede that laid that down payment on those missiles wasn\u2019t a happy little camper after his arrest, and he has friends. Friends who most likely are sitting right here just waiting to see who they should target to get that money back. A million dollars is a hell of a lot of money, Natches, even in today\u2019s economy.\u201d</p><p>His brow arched. \u201cThat was one of your flimsier excuses,\u201d he told her. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p> <p>Chaya stared back at him, recognizing the slow, lazy drawl as it passed his lips. It wasn\u2019t what he said, it was how he said it. It was the dangerous throb of suspicion just beneath the careless tone, the warning that he wasn\u2019t buying whatever she was selling. And she had warned Timothy he wouldn\u2019t. No matter the truth of it, Natches knew there was more going on. Somehow, the list of names she had interviewed today, in that little group, she had managed to tip Natches off, and it wasn\u2019t just her questioning of Ray Mackay.</p><p>\u201cSomeone in Somerset was helping Johnny,\u201d she told him. \u201cSomeone who had more contacts than Jim Bedsford could have managed. Bedsford was a front, Natches, nothing more. Someone else was pulling the strings.\u201d</p><p>He leaned against the low counter, crossed his arms over his chest and stared back at her with those frighteningly observant eyes of his. Sometimes, she swore he could see clear down to her soul with those dark green eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your proof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBedsford\u2019s contacts couldn\u2019t have gotten him and the Swede together last year for that missile deal. That group doesn\u2019t deal with penny-ante thieves. They\u2019re too slick for that no matter how impressive the merchandise. Someone else brokered that deal, someone from Somerset. Someone Timothy\u2019s been chasing for years. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe deal in Iraq?\u201d he asked her then. \u201cThe one Craig was involved in? Does it tie in?\u201d The illegal transfer of arms and information to terrorists, and the unsanctioned attack on the hotel, the explosion that killed her daughter.</p><p>She flinched at the question and forced back the more personal aspects between herself and Natches now. There were things they had to deal with, later. Right now, she had to deal with this, and she hated it.</p><p>\u201cIt ties in,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt also ties in to several other thefts the public is unaware of, that were made too close to Somerset. Those thefts go back further than Iraq and the threads of suspicion lead right back to Somerset.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re here to do what? Avenge Beth?\u201d He shook his head wearily as he pushed his fingers through his hair and stared back at her. She could see the memories in his eyes, too. The loss. The pain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to ask the right questions and see if I can\u2019t force them into making a move. Timothy has other agents watching persons of interest.\u201d She held her hand up as he started to speak. \u201cI have no idea who they\u2019re watching. I\u2019m here to ask the questions; they\u2019re here to see who moves after I ask those questions. This isn\u2019t about Beth, Natches. It\u2019s about stopping it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s put your ass in the line of fire and he\u2019s hoping to catch whoever puts you in their sights?\u201d he bit out. \u201cSon of a bitch, Chay. He\u2019s working you. He\u2019s using your baby and your pain, and he\u2019s working you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like to think of it that way, but she inclined her head in agreement, because there was always the risk of that. Timothy was definitely capable of it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hoping to catch whoever he\u2019s watching through the questions he\u2019s sending me to ask. He\u2019s spent years investigating this, Natches. He\u2019s not going to stop now.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think he didn\u2019t expect me to get involved?\u201d He threw her a disbelieving look as he paced to the other side of the room and turned back to face her, his hands propped on his hips, his expression forbidding.</p><p>\u201cI was told to keep you as far away from this as possible. He knew you wouldn\u2019t stay away from me, but he was hoping you would stay out of the rest of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you were more intelligent than that. Hell, I thought Timothy was,\u201d he growled. \u201cDo you believe that bull-shit, Chaya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m asking you to do it anyway,\u201d she told him. She didn\u2019t want him involved in this. She wanted him as far away from Timothy Cranston\u2019s games as possible. She knew how Timothy worked. He lied and he connived and manipulated everyone to get what he wanted, the way he wanted it. She didn\u2019t want Natches pulled into the webs Timothy created.</p><p>\u201cAll I have to do is ask the questions,\u201d she repeated. \u201cThe danger is limited, Natches, and he\u2019s watching whoever he suspects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe suspects someone he knows I\u2019ll try to protect, or he wouldn\u2019t have sent you.\u201d He snorted. \u201cAnd that one, I have to admit, has me as confused as hell. Because Timothy knows me, too, and he knows there\u2019s few people here that I\u2019d protect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one you would protect could be involved,\u201d she argued. \u201cRowdy, Dawg, Ray, or their wives? For God\u2019s sake, I know for a fact they aren\u2019t under suspicion. Do you think I didn\u2019t do my own damned homework? Do you think I would let him try to crucify someone I believe is innocent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimothy wouldn\u2019t try to crucify someone who\u2019s innocent.\u201d Natches shook his head as he stared at her from across the room.</p><p>He looked dangerous, too controlled, too suspicious.</p><p>\u201cTimothy\u2019s a lot of things,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut he doesn\u2019t do witch hunts. Whoever he suspects, you can bet they\u2019re guilty, he just needs the proof of it. And he\u2019ll sacrifice anyone or anything for that proof, Chaya. Even you.\u201d</p><p>He had already sacrificed her, and she knew it. He couldn\u2019t have guessed that Natches would give a damn about her if his cousins turned against her. And it appeared that was exactly what was happening.</p><p>And perhaps Natches wasn\u2019t standing by her. He was angry, she knew that. Suspicious.</p><p>She turned away from him and moved to the sliding doors, staring beyond them to the nearly deserted boathouses. Summer was over. There were very few year-round residents here. And she didn\u2019t blame them. It was colder than hell on the water.</p><p>\u201cDawg, Rowdy, and Ray aren\u2019t under suspicion. Neither is Crista. I have Timothy\u2019s word on it,\u201d she told him quietly. \u201cAccording to him, he doesn\u2019t want you involved in this because you draw too much notice and you\u2019re too temperamental where the Mackays are concerned. The questions he has me asking involve family, connections between Chandler Mackay, Nadine, and Johnny Grace. I record the answers and send the recordings via FTP back to him.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what Timothy was looking for, and she was beginning to wonder if it even mattered. Timothy knew who he was after by now. The questions had begun changing, taking a new direction, leading her straight into the heart of too many family secrets. At this point, he was merely playing a delicate little game designed to catch his quarry faster.</p><p>\u201cI want to see the names and the questions before you leave each morning.\u201d</p><p>She swung around. \u201cI have direct orders that you\u2019re not to see anything.\u201d And she followed orders. The agency had been her life for the past five years. It had held her together when nothing else could have.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>Chaya felt her stomach tighten as he moved across the room. Clothes did not hide the shift or power of the muscle lurking beneath them, nor did it hide the sheer arrogance of the male animal she was now facing.</p><p>\u201cI said, I will see the names and the questions before you leave my bed each morning,\u201d he growled, his eyes darkening, his expression forbidding, and for the first time in ten years, Chaya faced a force that had her swallowing back her nerves.</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Chay, sweetheart,\u201d he crooned. \u201cNow we just don\u2019t wanna go there, do we? We wanna wake up in that big bed of mine, nice and warm every morning, and work this out together. Because, if we\u2019re not working this out together, then we\u2019re going to be fighting. Yelling. At odds. Out of sorts. And if we\u2019re out of sorts, then bad things might start happening. I might follow you into these places where you\u2019re questioning folks. I might make things rather hard.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him in confusion. \u201cWhy? I swear, your family is not involved in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething more important than family is involved here,\u201d he said then.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She threw her hands up in disbelief, amazed that Natches could find anything more important than family. From what she had seen since coming to Somerset, he wouldn\u2019t just die for them, he killed for them. \u201cWhat could be more important to you than your cousins or your uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him, and she swore she felt the very air around them become thicker, still, heavy with tension.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d She shook her head slowly. He had to be lying to her. He loved his family, he was loyal to them, loyal enough that he would lie to her.</p><p>It broke her heart, but she accepted it. She had no other choice.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie to me,\u201d she whispered, moving around him as she put her hand to her brow and eased her palm over the perspiration forming there. \u201cI know you have priorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you do. And I thought you knew, Chay, I don\u2019t bother to lie to anyone. Wastes too much of my damned time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She held her hand up while keeping her back turned to him. She couldn\u2019t handle this. If he needed this bad enough to lie to her, then fine. He could have it. It wasn\u2019t enough to tip Timothy off, and she knew Natches was going to do whatever the hell he wanted to do anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou can see the list and the questions,\u201d she whispered, picking up her briefcase before turning to face him. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the hotel in the morning.\u201d</p><p>A sharp laugh left his throat. \u201cBullshit. You\u2019re not leaving me. Not again, Chaya. I\u2019ll tie you to the damned bed at night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to stand here and let you lie to me to protect your family.\u201d Something was building in her, shimmering like a bloodred cloud in front of her vision as she watched his eyes go from dark to light, watched moss green go brilliant green, like a forest in spring.</p><p>\u201cYou actually believe I\u2019d lie to you like that?\u201d He glowered back at her. \u201cBaby, I don\u2019t have to lie to you to get that list, those questions, or anything else I need out of you. All I have to do is get you beneath me.\u201d</p><p>And it snapped in her head then. Chaya felt herself almost sway in shock. He hadn\u2019t used a condom last night or the night before. He had been bare, his semen spurting inside her, sending her crashing into another wave of release even as a part of her mind had whispered the warning. Each time, and her emotions had been in such disarray that she had ignored the implications.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t protected.</p><p>\u201cNot without a condom you won\u2019t be.\u201d Her head snapped up, her vision clearing as fear surged through her. \u201cAnd not without the truth between us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth? It\u2019s a fairly easy concept . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean the condom.\u201d His hand sliced through the air. \u201cI\u2019m safe, Chay, and you know it just as well as I do. I may have played some games in my life, but I always protected myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about STDs,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI\u2019m not protected, Natches. I went off the agency-sanctioned shots last year when I thought I was resigning and didn\u2019t have time to restart them. You need condoms. I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t use one last night.\u201d</p><p>Natches stared back at her. From her eyes, to her stomach. Back to her eyes and her stomach again as he swallowed tightly.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t protected? He\u2019d filled her more than once with his release the night before, pumping into her, crying her name, feeling her so sleek and hot, milking it from him.</p> <p>Use a condom now? The first time he\u2019d taken her, there\u2019d been nothing between them either, and he remembered that last mission, wondering about the agency protection she used. Wishing she didn\u2019t. Wishing he could fill her with his baby, to give back to her everything she had lost.</p><p>He blinked now, feeling the sweat that gathered on his back, the sense of hunger that suddenly raged through his body. He\u2019d rationalized those thoughts as insanity years before. Her grief had marked him in a way he hadn\u2019t expected, couldn\u2019t have been prepared for, he had told himself.</p><p>But now it wasn\u2019t grief. He was staring at her belly, seeing her growing round with his child, and the hunger for it grew.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Her eyes narrowed on him as he jerked his gaze back to hers. \u201cI\u2019m safe right now, Natches, but that doesn\u2019t last long. Get the condoms. And stop lying to me. We\u2019ll get along much better that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head slowly, barely able to believe that word had slipped past his lips. They were numb, his throat was tight, thick with so many emotions he didn\u2019t know how to make sense of them.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She had a death grip on that briefcase and one on his soul. Hell, even he hadn\u2019t known the grip she had on him until now. \u201cIs the truth so damned hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is easy.\u201d He had to fight to hold himself back, to keep from latching onto her, to keep from devouring her. \u201cI meant, no condoms.\u201d</p><p>Chaya went silent. Even her thoughts seemed to stop in shock as she stared back at Natches. He couldn\u2019t have said that. He didn\u2019t just say that.</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d She wet her lips. Had he changed his mind that quickly? Was she misunderstanding something important in this conversation? \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to have sex with me, I can understand . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to lay you down and lick every inch of your body. I want to bring you over me and watch you ride me. I want to fuck you so many ways, so many times, that neither of us can find the energy to crawl from the floor let alone the bed. Oh, baby, wanting you is like a sickness with me, and it never fucking goes away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her heart was racing. Each word out of his mouth had her skin sensitizing, her clit swelling. \u201cThen what do you mean, no condom?\u201d</p><p>He stalked to her then. Slowly. His expression was more savage than she could ever remember seeing it, his eyes bright, his lashes lowered over them. He looked dark. Dangerous. And something in that look terrified her.</p><p>\u201cI mean, if you don\u2019t want my baby, then you better get your ass to a clinic and take care of the birth control yourself.\u201d His hand flattened on her stomach as she stared back at him in a shock so deep, so overwhelming, she wondered how she was standing upright. \u201cBecause I\u2019m betting I have the fastest, slickest little soldiers in the state of Kentucky. Just a breath of a chance, sweetheart, and you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d His expression, his eyes, grew taut with possessiveness. Possessiveness and lust. \u201cAnd I could very much get into making damned certain they have every chance.\u201d</p><p>Chaya felt herself swaying. She could feel the blood draining from her face, even as it began to thunder in her ears.</p><p>She could feel Natches\u2019s hand on her belly, his eyes boring into her soul, as though will alone, and nothing more, could make her conceive.</p><p>And it didn\u2019t make sense. She couldn\u2019t understand this. He couldn\u2019t be serious.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She forced the word past numb lips. Why would he want to tie himself to her like that?</p><p>\u201cAh, Chay,\u201d he whispered, his expression gentling, just a bit, just enough to force her to trap a sob in her chest rather than give rise to the cry that seemed to echo through her soul. \u201cSweetheart. Don\u2019t you know I\u2019d give everything I possess to hold you to me? And the thought of giving you my child, of watching that pretty belly grow large with my baby, makes my dick so damned hard I wonder if it\u2019s going to push straight past the zipper of my jeans.\u201d</p><p>She felt the briefcase drop from her fingers as she stared back at him, searching his eyes, searching for the lie. There had to be a lie there. But lying didn\u2019t make sense. She knew Natches. Knew he would never, ever risk a child of his so cavalierly. He was so damned protective over family that even Cranston feared him. He would kill for them. He had proven it.</p><p>\u201cChay.\u201d He breathed her name against her lips, and she felt herself weaken. Her knees. Her soul. Something inside her, something she needed for protection, to hold back the dreams and the loss and the years she had run, even from herself, began to crack. \u201cLet me have you like that. Just us. Just the chance that we could dream together like that.\u201d</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>Natches could feel himself shaking inside, a need, a hunger he couldn\u2019t control, didn\u2019t want to control, rising inside him.</p><p>Chaya. Just her name invoked the power to make his knees weak, to make him hard, to make him want to believe in miracles and to reach for them.</p><p>The boy inside him that had once screamed out in the darkened forest, howling in fury at the loneliness, the pain that melded through his body, howled out now in hope.</p><p>Because Chaya was here. For such a brief moment in time in a foreign desert, in a hostile land, Natches had known peace. One night, so far away that it felt like a dream, he had held her in his arms and knew she belonged to him. No matter what happened, no matter where life took either of them, he had found the one person that was his alone.</p><p>Chaya.</p><p>He stared into her eyes. Honey eyes. Eyes that drew him in and promised him life, promised him joy. He could find joy with her. He found joy with her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not serious,\u201d she murmured, her voice as dazed as he felt lowering his hand once more to her stomach. There, his child could be growing even now. Sheltered in the warmth of her body, growing strong and sure.</p><p>Sweet God\u2014the prayer slipped into his mind unbidden\u2014let my child rest there. Within the woman who held his soul.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d die for you,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019d kill for you, Chay. And I\u2019d go to my knees for you.\u201d</p><p>He had never willingly gone to his knees for anyone, man or woman, no matter how many times his father had tried to force him there.</p><p>She blinked back at him. Those clear golden eyes of hers flickering with dreams that she fought to keep buried, with hope that he knew she tried to hide.</p><p>She was his hope, but he knew, to the bottom of his soul he knew, he was hers as well.</p><p>\u201cNatches.\u201d She shook her head, her lips parted, fully, lush now with the arousal he knew was moving through her.</p><p>It made her wet, just as it made him hard, the thought of coming together, bare, unprotected, spilling into each other to create something new. Something innocent.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have been that way. He knew that. Hell, the last thing he needed to think about with his childhood was a kid. But a baby with Chaya? Something to bind her to him forever, just as he would be bound to her.</p><p>Family was his salvation. His uncle Ray, his cousins, they were all the family he\u2019d had. He\u2019d never had his own. Until now, he hadn\u2019t wanted his own.</p><p>\u201cYou want me like that, Chay, don\u2019t you?\u201d He lifted her shirt, flattened his hand against the bare skin of her stomach and watched her eyes.</p><p>It was Chaya\u2019s eyes that held her secrets. There, they flickered in those honeyed depths, the soft golden brown color warming him no matter her mood.</p><p>\u201cBare, Chay.\u201d His jaw clenched at the hunger. \u201cI want to pump inside you and feel you reaching for me. Milking me. That sweet hot body taking my seed and nourishing it.\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed instantly, hot, as her eyes flickered with fear and with dreams.</p><p>\u201cI want to watch your stomach grow round with my baby. I want to lay my head against it, feel our child move within you.\u201d</p><p>She trembled, shuddered, and her eyes darkened as they always did when she began to surrender to him.</p><p>He wanted that surrender.</p><p>Before his knees gave out on him he swept her up in his arms, ignoring her little cry of protest and he carried her through the boathouse to the stairs. Up the rounded staircase, to the bedroom, to the big bed that awaited them, the sun-drenched warmth that welcomed them.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just decide to make a baby.\u201d She was breathing hard, rough as he set her on her feet and pushed her blazer over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOf course we can,\u201d he crooned, knowing, as he had always known, how much she loved that sound. When his voice roughened, deepened. She shivered in response to it. A sound he had never known how to make, had never given another woman.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s completely irresponsible,\u201d she protested, but it was a moan, filled with surrender as his hands stroked down her arms then gripped the hem of her shirt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s every dream I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he told her as he tore the shirt from her body and cupped those pretty breasts as they filled the lace of her bra. \u201cI want to watch you nurse our child here.\u201d He kissed the full mounds as they spilled over the cups of her bra. \u201cChay, you know you want it, don\u2019t you, baby? Bound to me? You won\u2019t be able to just walk away anymore. Think of it, sweetheart. No more reasons to run, and every reason to lie in my arms night after night.\u201d</p><p>It was her nightmare and he knew it. He used it shamelessly, because he also knew it was her weakness. His Chay. So tough, so determined to never lose again, to never hurt as she had hurt before. To never risk having what she cherished most taken from her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had run from him, because she couldn\u2019t face losing him. He\u2019d figured that out about her. Knew it about her. Just as she surely knew he wouldn\u2019t allow her to run any longer if she ever returned to Somerset.</p><p>The running was over.</p><p>\u201cNatches, this isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d She was thinking. He could feel her thinking.</p><p>His lips moved to hers. He sipped at her lips as a breathless moan passed them. He stroked them with his tongue as he nearly tore his shirt from his own body. He caught that lush lower curve between his lips and laved it, nipped at it, and watched her lashes flutter over eyes gone dark with hunger.</p><p>No thinking right now, he decided. That sharp little mind of hers needed to rest; it needed to be stroked and loved, tempted and teased. And he was just the man to do it.</p><p>He loosened her belt, aware of the weight of her weapon at her hip, and almost grinned at the thought of it. His woman was a tough little warrior. She would walk by his side. She wouldn\u2019t put up with his moods, and she\u2019d tell him like it was. Always. The thought of it turned him on even more. She was a fitting mate for the darkness inside him, because she lightened it.</p><p>He released her jeans, slid the zipper down, and, as he released her lips, slid his palm beneath her panties to the sweet, rich flesh beyond.</p><p>So hot it almost burned. Swollen, slick with her sweet juices. His mouth watered at the thought of tasting her again. Of burying his tongue inside her, and lapping at her like hot, delicate candy. Like nectar. Like life itself.</p><p>\u201cThere, baby, let me have you,\u201d he urged as she shook, trembled, her nails digging into his shoulders as he held her to him. \u201cRemember how good it is? How hot?\u201d</p><p>He worked her jeans and panties over her hips, careful to keep in contact with the wet folds between her thighs, his finger caressing, his palm grinding against her clit.</p><p>And she was burning for him. Her hips shifted, moving against his hand, grinding her clit against his hand as he eased her to the bed.</p><p>Her cry of protest flamed through him as he moved his hand, but the taste of her exploded against his tongue as he pressed a kiss against the swollen little nubbin of her clit.</p><p>As he kissed, licked her gently, he worked her boots from her feet and finished undressing her. When she was soft and hot and naked, stretched across his bed and immersed in her arousal, he paused long enough to jerk his boots off and finish undressing himself. When he turned back to her, his sensual little kitten was on her knees, gold eyes glittering with hunger now, her features flushed, desire raging in her eyes.</p><p>This was the woman he dreamed of. The woman who had taken him to heaven that night so long ago.</p><p>His head went back as she came over him, her lips on his, her hands sliding over his damp shoulders, nails raking as he ran his hands up her back and prepared to hold on for the ride.</p><p>He remembered Chaya, wild and hungry, too long ago. He had ached for that woman, needed her as he\u2019d needed nothing else, tempted and teased her, and here she was. The balm to the wounds that had festered inside his soul.</p><p>Chaya felt Natches ease back on the bed for her, felt his hard, muscular body laid out for her, hers for the taking, and it was like coming home. Like being in the cold and then sinking in front of a fire that filled the soul.</p><p>Natches\u2019s fire filled her soul. And he offered it to her willingly. A sacrifice to the unbearable hunger raging inside her now, untamed, breaking free of the fear that had housed it for so many years.</p><p>Oh God, how had she stayed away from him? Five years. She had been without him for five years and each day had been an eternity of need and loss that she hadn\u2019t realized, until now.</p><p>\u201cGod, Chay,\u201d he growled, a deep, rough sound that stroked her senses as his hands stroked her back. \u201cThere you go, baby. Come to me.\u201d</p><p>She nipped at his lips, caressed them, and let him devour her. He didn\u2019t let her control the kiss; he never would, she knew. He was powerful, dominant, but he gave his body freely, and tonight she intended to take. And take.</p><p>She trembled at the thought of taking all of him. Of giving all of herself. And she knew that was exactly what she was doing, giving herself.</p> <p>Lifting her head she stared down at him, at those wild green eyes, the way his thick black hair fanned out from his savage face. The way the muscles flexed in his shoulders and arms, the perspiration that trailed down his neck. And she had to taste it.</p><p>She lapped at it with her tongue, filled her senses with the taste of him, and gloried in the sound of that rough male groan.</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d The whimpering sob shocked her as it fell from her lips, pressed to his flesh. \u201cOh God, Natches. I needed you. I needed you until I burned. Until I thought I\u2019d die without seeing you, hearing you.\u201d</p><p>His hands flattened on her back, held her closer.</p><p>\u201cI was right here, baby.\u201d</p><p>Right here. In his bed, waiting for her.</p><p>Sleek and hard and hungry.</p><p>Her lips slid from his neck to his chest, feathered over hard male nipples before her teeth raked first one then the other. He jerked beneath her, and she thrilled at the evidence of his pleasure.</p><p>Another thing he gave her freely, his pleasure. She didn\u2019t have to worry about how to please him, because every touch she had ever given him, he had urged her on, relishing it.</p><p>\u201cAh, Chay, sweet baby.\u201d His hands slid to her sides, to the curve of her breasts, and the backs of his fingers caressed them with subtle heat.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t stingy with his touches or his words.</p><p>Chaya luxuriated in the generosity. His heat, the friction of his hair-roughened male chest against her swollen nipples. The feel of his muscles tightening, his breath rasping in his lungs as her lips slid lower.</p><p>She took quick, heated kisses down the center of his body, moving with slow, delicate greed to the thick, steel-hard shaft that reached up his lower stomach, eager for her touch.</p><p>Natches shifted, his hands pulling at her hips as her head went lower. And she remembered that. Remembered how she had taken him in that humid little room in Iraq. The night her tears had mixed with her release, and they had drunk from each other.</p><p>She tasted the head of his cock, her tongue licking over it, curling around the engorged crest as the shaft jerked in response.</p><p>Natches lifted her leg as she slid into position, pulling her hips over his face and blowing a heated breath against the wet folds of her sex.</p><p>A whimper fell from her lips, because she knew what was coming and she couldn\u2019t wait. She lowered herself to him, feeling his tongue slide through liquid heat and tender tissue to burrow inside her vagina. Her lips opened over the head of his cock, her hands stroked the heavily veined shaft and Chaya let herself be taken, even as she took.</p><p>She worked her pussy on the thrusting tongue tormenting her with wicked pleasure. And with her mouth, she tormented in turn, crying out with delight, with need that bordered on pain.</p><p>His hands stroked over her rear, between the full curves, and teased the delicate flesh there as he worked his tongue through the slit of her pussy, circled her clit, and rubbed at it erotically. Stealing her mind.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t allow him to steal her mind. Not yet. She needed to stroke him, touch him. She needed to pour the past five years of loss and loneliness into every touch. Then she needed to take him as she had dreamed of taking him. Riding them both into ecstasy.</p><p>Before he could stop her, not that he tried hard, she swung away, lifting herself from his lips despite his growl of displeasure and her own aching regret.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t touch him as she wanted to if he stole her strength as she was doing so. When Natches touched her, she melted. Tonight, she wanted him to melt.</p><p>And Natches was melting. He stared down his body, strung tight with the most incredible pleasure. Pleasure that went beyond pleasure and bordered on agony of sensations. Chaya knelt above him, straddling one hard leg, rubbing the slick heat of her pussy against it as she worked her mouth on his cock head.</p><p>Sucking and licking, moaning in pleasure as her honey gold eyes darkened further and glittered with the needs rising inside her.</p><p>God he loved this. Seeing her like this. The agent disappeared beneath the woman\u2019s demands as those demands took over.</p><p>She sucked greedily at his cock head. Her hands stroked the shaft of his erection and his balls as they drew up tight at their base.</p><p>He was in an agony of sensation now. Her hands were silken heat, her nails rasping, her mouth. . . . Sweet heaven, her mouth was like ecstatic fire licking over his flesh as her heated, wet pussy rubbed against his leg.</p><p>She was pleasuring him as she pleasured herself. Taking him and twining deeper into his soul as she did so.</p><p>Chaya lost herself in each touch, in each taste of Natches\u2019s hard body. As though she had been born for this, to belong to him.</p><p>Drawing back she licked the hard crest one last time before allowing her tongue to taste the thick, silken shaft. Heated iron met her lips, silken heat stretched tight. Heavy veins throbbed with anticipation just beneath the flesh, and with each lick, she swore his cock grew harder, pulsed harder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d His voice was graveled, thick and rasping as she kissed the base then licked the tightly drawn sac below.</p><p>He flinched, jerked, and moaned hard and low.</p><p>Chaya clenched her legs around the hard thigh rubbing against her pussy and knew she was drowning in this pleasure. She was sinking into a sensual storm and had no idea how to save herself. She didn\u2019t want to save herself. She wanted to ride the waves. She wanted them cresting over her, surrounding her, swamping her.</p><p>She lifted her head and dragged herself over him, embracing his muscular hips with her thighs and lowering herself onto the rigid, heated flesh rising to her.</p><p>\u201cThere, Chay. That\u2019s it, sweetheart; take me. All of me, Chay. It\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>She stared into the narrowed bands of green as he watched her, his expression twisted into lines of savage lust and determination.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t keep from sobbing at the pleasure. The feel of him penetrating her slowly, taking her as his hands moved up her back, down her arms, then his hard fingers linked with hers.</p><p>\u201cTake me, Chay,\u201d he demanded. \u201cThis ride is all yours, baby.\u201d He was barely buried inside her, his cock throbbing, eager to take her.</p><p>\u201cRide me, Chay, like we\u2019ve both dreamed.\u201d</p><p>She straightened, flung her head back at the incredible pleasure racing through her, and she took him. Slow and easy, then with quick, shallow strokes. Her hips twisted, rose and lowered and she lost that final piece of herself.</p><p>Nothing mattered but the pleasure. Nothing mattered but the sensation of flying within his embrace, knowing he was there to catch her if she fell, that he would hold her if she faltered, and he would give her the reins when she needed them.</p><p>She needed them now.</p><p>Holding on to his hands she took him to the hilt, feeling all that wild heat and hardness penetrating her, stretching her, a burn that was pleasure and pain, and she gloried in it.</p><p>She twisted against him, and she rode him as he lifted beneath her, driving his erection deeper and harder inside her. Perspiration gathered between them. It rolled down her shoulders, ran in rivulets down his chest. Slick and heated they clashed together, twisting and thrusting, strokes that speared straight to her soul as the driving rhythm grew, deepened, heated until she was exploding, flaming out of control and screaming out his name.</p><p>Deep wracking shudders jerked her body tight as her womb spasmed, her vagina convulsing, milking around him as his hard, throttled shout was followed by the deep, heated spurts of his seed inside her.</p><p>Chaya\u2019s eyes jerked open, met his and locked. She felt his cock jerk inside her, felt each pulse of his release, and felt her body heat and shudder further at the feel of it. That final hard orgasm rippled through her as his gaze held hers, as his soul wrapped around her. Forcing her to see, to know, nothing in life could be as good as right here, in his arms.</p><p>As the final, desperate tremors washed through her, she sank slowly against his chest, just fighting to breathe, to make sense of the woman she became when Natches touched her. Because it wasn\u2019t the woman she had known before she met him five years ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was as though he had opened something inside her during that time in a cramped little hole in the desert. He had rescued her. He had protected her. And as danger swirled around her he had teased her and made her want to fight at a time when it felt as though the fight had been sucked out of her.</p><p>And that was how he made her feel now. Like fighting. Like tearing down the obstacles she knew stretched between them, and she knew it could be done so easily.</p><p>She could betray Natches, or she could betray the rules she had lived her life by. And at this moment, she knew the choice she was going to make. No matter what tomorrow would bring, she chose Natches. The naughty dream that haunted her, the man who owned her soul.</p> <p>I love you. She mouthed the words against his chest because she couldn\u2019t bring herself to say them yet. As sanity began to whisper through her mind once again, that one shred of fear remained. She had only told one person in her life that she loved them, and that tiny vision of purity was gone now, jerked from her so brutally that she had feared she wouldn\u2019t survive it.</p><p>That edge of fear still held its grip on her, strangling her with the words that wouldn\u2019t whisper past her lips and bringing tears to her eyes as she held on to Natches tighter.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Chaya,\u201d he said, his voice rough. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby, because I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>Somewhere in the darkness of night, she had to have lost her ever-loving mind. And finding it again didn\u2019t appear to be an assignment Natches was going to allow her.</p> <p>\u201cLook, you have the information, the interview files, and the recordings,\u201d she told him the next morning as the first rays of the sun began to peek over the tops of the mountains. \u201cI need to return to my hotel room\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd check out,\u201d he interrupted her, his voice controlled, mild, as he went through the files she had transferred to his laptop. \u201cYou\u2019ll move into the apartment with me. Dawg and Rowdy should have the door fixed by now.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled deeply. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to work right now, Natches.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head slowly. It was a curiously dangerous movementthe way he did it. The calculated restraint in it had her holding back the shiver that would have worked up her spine.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you won\u2019t have a chance to rebuild all those nifty little defenses you keep between us?\u201d he asked, his mocking smile grating on her temper.</p><p>\u201cBecause I won\u2019t have the investigation compromised any more than it has been already,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m sharing information with you despite direct orders to the contrary. Do you have any idea how many years Cranston could put me behind bars for that?\u201d</p> <p>He merely grunted at that and turned back to the file.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting Mayes in just a few hours. I need clean clothes, and I have my own notes to put together as soon as Cranston sends the new list of interviewees this morning. I can\u2019t do that with you breathing over my shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well give it up now,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re not driving back to that hotel alone and you\u2019re not staying there alone. You don\u2019t want to stay at the apartment, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll stay at the hotel.\u201d</p><p>He said it absently, his eyes narrowed on the laptop screen, as though simply because it was his decision then it was a foregone conclusion that it was happening.</p><p>\u201cNatches, you seem to be forgetting something here,\u201d she told him coldly. \u201cThis is my investigation and my job. I don\u2019t need your help doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you keep tellin\u2019 me.\u201d That smooth southern drawl deepened, causing her to wince. This wasn\u2019t the sexy, lazy drawl. This was the cool, velvet drawl of a man who had no intentions of backing down.</p><p>\u201cDo I poke my nose into your garage?\u201d she finally snapped. \u201cDo I tell you how to fix cars or how to deal with customers?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and stared back at her. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p> <p>That shut her up and she hated it. Turning her back on him she propped one hand on her hip as she nibbled at her thumbnail and glared at the covered window.</p><p>Despite Cranston\u2019s orders to keep the Mackay cousins out of the investigation, she would have cheerfully told him to shove it if she thought the investigation would proceed better with Natches involved. Unfortunately, she had a feeling she knew exactly where it was headed, and she didn\u2019t need Natches there for that.</p><p>She had read his file so many times she had nightmares about the childhood he had endured. His father was ex-Marine and a sorry bastard. Dayle Mackay was a bully, heavily muscled; he had nearly beaten a young Natches to death more than once. Natches\u2019s back still held the scars of the most brutal beating that he had taken, at the age of twenty. The night his father had disowned him, he had beaten Natches to the floor then ripped his back to shreds with a lash. All because Natches had refused to allow his father to strike his sister, Janey Mackay.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll only complicate matters for me at the moment, Natches. As well as bring Cranston out of the woodwork.\u201d She turned back to him as he lifted his head once again and stared back at her. His forest green eyes were mocking, his smile knowing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not happening, Chay.\u201d He closed the files out before leaning back against the couch and watching her with hooded eyes now. \u201cFrom this moment on, just call me your shadow. Because doing this alone isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the sheriff with me. Most of the people I\u2019m talking to seem to share a dislike for you, Natches. It wouldn\u2019t be conducive to my investigation if you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>He just smiled. A patient, questioning smile as though he were trying to figure out exactly why she was still arguing with him.</p><p>She propped her hands on her hips and glared back at him. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s try it this way. You are not accompanying me on those interviews. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes me hard when you get mean, Chay,\u201d he drawled. \u201cCome over here and sit on my lap while we discuss it.\u201d He patted his knee invitingly and she wanted to kick herself for almost moving toward him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just being an ass now, Natches. Stop it and let me do my job. I can be amazingly adept at that when I don\u2019t have to deal with men who think they can do everything better than I can.\u201d She smiled with false sweetness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to watch your back when you\u2019re concerned with watching where you\u2019re going.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI watch backs real good. Ask the Marines, they loved me.\u201d</p><p>Of course they had, he had been a suicide mission waiting to happen for over four years and probably would have taken another tour if a sniper hadn\u2019t taken out his shoulder.</p><p>There was talk that Natches had arranged the hit, that he knew it was coming and managed to deflect the damage. Chaya knew better. Natches didn\u2019t play games. Oh, he may well have known the danger was there and that the shot would be taken. His instincts were so well honed that he had probably felt it coming and, yes, deflected the damage. But it wasn\u2019t arranged. Natches was too honest for that, too in-your-face to ever play those games.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to watch my back here,\u201d she told him. \u201cThat\u2019s the sheriff\u2019s job. You have no place in this assignment, and you don\u2019t need to be involved.\u201d</p><p>And he just smiled. Again.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Natches. You\u2019re not even a contract agent on this assignment. I am not letting you butt your nose into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go pick your stuff up at the hotel this morning? You can pack while you\u2019re waiting on Cranston\u2019s e-mail to come through.\u201d</p><p>He was as immovable as the mountains surrounding them. Stubbornness defined his expression and the cool green of his eyes, and had her gritting her teeth to hold back her anger and her desperation.</p><p>Was it too much to ask for just a few hours to think? To clear her head enough to make sense of what she had done the night before? Was that too much to ask for? Evidently it was as far as he was concerned.</p><p>\u201cYou are not returning to the hotel with me. I know how to pack on my own.\u201d There was no getting out of moving in with him, and she knew it. But at the moment, that was as far as she was willing to go. \u201cYou can give me that redneck pride and stubborn look until hell freezes over, but I\u2019m a fairly competent agent, Natches. Until Cranston begins sending names that might actually trip some tempers in your fair little county, I\u2019m doing this by the book. Period. And my book says I follow orders. And those orders say no Mackay cousins involved. Period.\u201d</p><p>Frustration flickered in his eyes\u2014and an edge of anger\u2014as he rose from the couch, standing to his full, impressive six feet two inches. And he glared at her. Natches\u2019s glaring was sexy as hell, but it was also damned intimidating.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know this town or these people,\u201d he argued again. \u201cYou don\u2019t know which questions will trip tempers, and from the looks of the previous questions, tempers were more than likely tripped further than what you believe. This isn\u2019t the city, Chay. It\u2019s Kentucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like another planet.\u201d She rolled her eyes at his tone. \u201cThey\u2019re still people, Natches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they?\u201d he growled. \u201cOne of the good ole boys you questioned can shoot a deer from over a half mile out and his hunting rifle is sighted for even farther distances. How much easier would it be to take out one lone little agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you stop bullets, too?\u201d She widened her eyes in mock surprise. \u201cWhy, Natches. Why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner that you were freakin\u2019 Superman?\u201d</p><p>She watched him grind his teeth, the bunching of his jaw muscles, the flattening of his lips. Yeah, it was sexy as hell, but pretty damned intimidating.</p><p>\u201cI was a Marine assassin,\u201d he snarled. \u201cDo you think I won\u2019t feel those sights on you before some stupid bastard takes the shot? I know what it feels like, Chay, and you don\u2019t want me going hunting if something happens to you, because the first son of a bitch I\u2019d look up would be Timothy Cranston.\u201d</p><p>Chaya almost took a step back at the banked anger in Natches\u2019s eyes. She wanted to tell him yes more than anything. But if she gave in to him now, then she may as well turn the entire investigation over to him because she would completely lose control.</p><p>\u201cAnd do you think I don\u2019t know when I have gunsights leveled on me, Natches? Do I really look that fucking green? That I\u2019m not aware of when I\u2019m pushing too many damned buttons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInternational fucking terrorists are not damned pissed-off rednecks,\u201d he almost yelled. \u201cNo rules here, Chay. No warning. No instinct, unless you\u2019re one of them.\u201d</p><p>She held on to her own temper by a fingernail.</p><p>\u201cMy strength in these interviews is the fact that you aren\u2019t with me, and though you\u2019ve been shadowing me, you\u2019re far enough away that most people are more amused than concerned. You\u2019ll hamper my ability to get the answers I need, Natches, and that will only hinder the investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think people aren\u2019t going to know you\u2019re living with me?\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest and glowered back at her.</p><p>\u201cWhere I sleep isn\u2019t as big an issue as you sitting there terrifying everyone I question or having you chauffeur me from place to place. If we change the process at this point, we hamper it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what the bloody hell does that have to do with me returning to the hotel with you this morning?\u201d His voice rose slightly, just enough to assure her that his patience was reaching its limit.</p><p>\u201cBecause I need a few minutes to think if you don\u2019t fucking mind,\u201d she yelled back at him. \u201cExcuse me, Natches, but you have my brain in so many damned pieces it resembles a puzzle right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does have that habit.\u201d Dawg stepped in as he slid the sliding glass door open and stared at Chaya, who fought to pull her anger back and adopt the cool, unaffected appearance she gave everyone but Natches. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And evidently, she was failing, because he was staring at her as though he didn\u2019t know her. His eyes narrowed, his celadon green eyes, so light they were almost colorless, watching her curiously.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d Natches growled at his cousin. \u201cYou know, Dawg, this nosy attitude of yours is really starting to piss me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Dawg finally shrugged. \u201cI just thought I should let you know that I have a call coming in about a half hour on that project we were working on. I need you there.\u201d</p> <p>Natches glared at his cousin. The project was this damned assignmentChaya was on, and it was obvious Dawg was hesitant about including her in on it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure he has information now regarding your little project,\u201d she snorted knowingly as she stomped across the room and pushed her laptop back into the case before collecting the keys to her sedan, which the sheriff had had delivered to the marina the evening before.</p><p>As if she didn\u2019t know what the hell they were talking about. She wasn\u2019t a moron, and she didn\u2019t enjoy being treated like one.</p><p>From the look on Natches\u2019s face, he was still intent on following her though.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t turn this into a battle, Natches,\u201d she told him fiercely. \u201cNot yet. Not now. Being your lover is a far cry from being your lapdog. I don\u2019t heel worth crap, and you should know that right up front.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike I didn\u2019t figure that shit out in Iraq.\u201d Throttled male irritation spiked his voice and almost had her grinning.</p><p>Dawg didn\u2019t bother to hide his smile.</p><p>\u201cDamn, son,\u201d he drawled at Natches. \u201cI think you\u2019re losing this battle. Do you need any pointers? Advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo says the man who blackmailed his lover.\u201d Chaya rolled her eyes. \u201cReally, Dawg, I don\u2019t think Natches needs any advice from you. It could end up getting him arrested.\u201d</p><p>Dawg scowled as he turned to Natches. \u201cNot like you to tell tales, cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell the tale. I believe it\u2019s become something of a local legend. I\u2019ve heard about it from several sources, Dawg. Small-town secrets and all that.\u201d She smiled grimly.</p> <p>\u201cGo home, Dawg.\u201d Natches hadn\u2019t taken his eyes off her nor had his face lost the edge of irritation burning into anger.</p><p>Dawg grinned. \u201cBut this is more fun. Crista\u2019s sick again this morning. That virus is kicking her ass for some reason, and she ran me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go to work.\u201d Natches and Chaya snapped the order back at him simultaneously, causing him to chuckle.</p><p>\u201cSorry, kids, but this project is kind of important right now and I\u2019ve been working long and hard on it.\u201d He turned to Natches. \u201cYou know where I\u2019m at when you two get this ironed out. Try not to take all day though, because Crista\u2019s getting put out over my absence from the store. Like she can\u2019t run it better than I do anyway\u2014when she isn\u2019t sick.\u201d He shook his shaggy head as he turned to the door, slid it back open and stepped outside.</p><p>When it snapped closed again, Chaya pushed her fingers through her hair and stared back at Natches, aware that if she gave in to him now then she may as well turn every ounce of independence she possessed over to him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he was controlling, there was a difference between protective and controlling, she was finding. Her first husband, Craig, had been controlling. Natches was protective.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow you back to the hotel.\u201d He grimaced, adding, \u201cThen head back here. I\u2019ll meet up with you at the diner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Natches. I don\u2019t need a bodyguard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with having a damned partner? Hell, Chaya, I\u2019m not asking for anything you can\u2019t give me here.\u201d</p><p>She had never had a partner though. She had worked independently within a team, but she had never had a partner.</p><p>She shoved her hands into the pockets of her jeans and breathed out roughly. \u201cYou can follow me back to the hotel if you need to, but not to the room. I need to take care of checking out, and I have an early meeting scheduled in one of the other rooms with the other agents working the case. I\u2019ll be lucky to make it to the diner on time this morning.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed at her neck as she stared back at him, watching his expression settle a bit, though not by much. He still wasn\u2019t comfortable with this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not used to a partner either, Natches. I\u2019m used to working alone\u2014you know that. But I\u2019m trying. I really am.\u201d</p><p>And she was, but she needed this morning to get a grip on herself and what was changing in her life. He was changing things inside her that she had never imagined she would allow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too damned independent sometimes, Chaya.\u201d He stalked across the room and pulled her into his arms. One broad hand cupped the back of her head, his head lowered, and his lips covered hers.</p><p>Instantly, heat rose within her. Her breath caught and the passion that raged through her with each touch began to burn across her system.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why.\u201d He pulled back, his gaze so intent, so filled with emotion that she felt her chest clench at the sight of it. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve never known what you make me feel, Chay. And losing it would destroy me.\u201d</p><p>Those words haunted her that morning. She parked at the hotel, feeling his eyes on her as she entered and got the paperwork started for her checkout.</p><p>She moved from there straight to the meeting in one of the other agents\u2019 rooms, thanking God there were donuts and coffee because she had refused the breakfast Natches had offered her. Her nerves had been strung too tight, her senses too off balance to eat that early.</p><p>As the meeting wound up and she saved her notes to her laptop, she was looking forward to finally getting to her room. She would have an hour, maybe, to shower and get her thoughts in order before checking for Cranston\u2019s e-mail and making her notes for the interviews.</p><p>That hour didn\u2019t help though. As she stored her luggage in the rented car and stared back at the hotel, she felt the old fears rising inside her again. The same fears that had kept her from staying the year before. The ones that had kept her chasing danger rather than making a trip to Somerset long before any missiles had been hijacked.</p><p>That fear of loss.</p><p>As she slid into the car, she thought about living versus losing, and realized that if she didn\u2019t manage to lose Natches, then it would be the first time she had managed not to lose someone she loved.</p><p>She had lost her parents in her teens. Not to violence or to death, but to sheer disinterest. Her socialite mother and career-intensive father had no idea what to do with the little girl that always needed a hug or a kiss.</p><p>Her sister\u2014she had thought she\u2019d managed to maintain that relationship, before she found out Craig had been sleeping with her. The woman she would have trusted above anyone, the one she trusted her child with, had been sleeping with her husband.</p><p>Not that there had been a relationship between her and Craig for years. After Beth\u2019s birth, Craig had drifted away, and Chaya had slowly realized she didn\u2019t even miss him. When she had been called out on that last assignment in Iraq, she had already informed her superiors that she wouldn\u2019t be remaining after the assignment finished. She was resigning to stay home with her daughter. Beth was only three, and she needed her mother.</p><p>She forced back a muted sob at the thought of her little girl, her laughing eyes, her rounded, pretty face. Beth had been her life. And within a few short hours after her rescue, Natches had become her heart.</p><p>That betrayal was the one she had fought to forgive herself for. While her daughter was in danger, Chaya had been flirting with another man. Natches had sat in her hospital room, teased her with kisses, brought her flowers. He had slipped candy to her and he had made her laugh. And during that two weeks when she had been unable to contact her sister, Beth had been in Iraq with Craig.</p><p>She had been falling in love, and Beth had been in danger.</p><p>She hated herself for it. She had screamed out so many times in the darkness of the night, sobbing, begging for a forgiveness she couldn\u2019t give herself.</p><p>And now what was she doing? She laid her hand against her stomach and tried to fight the panic building inside her. Was she risking the life of another child?</p><p>She shook her head. She couldn\u2019t do this. First thing this evening she was stopping at a drugstore and picking up the condoms herself. It was her choice, Natches had warned her. If she wanted them, then she would have to remember them. She would have to remember them because she didn\u2019t know if she could face the consequences.</p><p>But a child. She had always wanted to be a mother. To make a secure, happy home filled with laughter and love, the very things she had never seemed to find until she had found Natches. Or he had found her.</p><p>And he wanted a child with her. The playboy of Somerset, the wildest, the most wicked of the Nauti Boys, and he wanted to keep her. He wanted to laugh with her, and he wanted to raise babies with her.</p><p>It was inconceivable.</p><p>Shaking her head, she started the car, then looked up in surprise as the sheriff\u2019s cruiser, followed by Natches\u2019s jeep, blocked her in.</p><p>Frowning, she opened the door and started out of the car.</p><p>\u201cGet your case.\u201d Natches jumped from the jeep and in two short strides was pulling her away from the car before reaching in and grabbing her briefcase. The door slammed behind her as Sheriff Mayes went to the ground, rolled onto his back and wedged himself beneath it.</p><p>\u201cMove.\u201d Natches was dragging her away from the sedan.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d Jerking her arm out of his grip she looked from him to where Sheriff Mayes\u2019s long legs stuck out beneath her vehicle.</p><p>Her gaze jerked up once again as three other vehicles pulled in. Dawg, Rowdy, and Ray Mackay jumped from their pickups and moved quickly to the car.</p><p>\u201cHave you checked under the hood yet, Zeke?\u201d Dawg called out.</p><p>\u201cGet your asses out of here. I have an explosives squad on the way. Don\u2019t you touch that car.\u201d</p><p>Male voices were filling the area as hotel employees and a few guests began to move from the building.</p><p>The sheriff rolled out and jumped to his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s here,\u201d he snarled. \u201cGet the hell away from the car. Now!\u201d</p><p>Chaya started in shock as Natches all but lifted her off her feet and pushed her into the jeep, forcing her to crawl over the console as he moved in behind her. With a jerk and a squeal of tires, the jeep raced a safe distance from the car, then with a hard twist of his wrist, Natches turned it in a quick half spin to face the vehicle as Chaya stared at him in complete disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d</p><p>Natches turned to her, dangerous. Here was danger. Forest green eyes were the color of moss, savage planes and angles marked his expression, and rage flickered in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou lost an agent this morning,\u201d he bit out, his voice dangerously soft.</p><p>Chaya stared back at him in mute shock.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? They were all at the meeting just an hour ago. I left them there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKyle Denton made it about three miles out of town before his car exploded. It took out a nice chunk of the interstate and the back end of the eighteen-wheeler he was driving behind. There\u2019s nothing left of him but fucking pieces. The minute Mayes learned it was Denton, he called me and we rushed here. Now tell me Chaya, who the fuck is Cranston after here?\u201d</p><p>Chaya felt her face go numb with grief and shock. She had just spoken to Kyle. He had told her about his engagement, to his third wife. He was barely forty. He had laughed about her showing up late and the news that she was moving into the boat with Natches. Accusing her of going above and beyond the call of duty.</p><p>He had a daughter in high school. She had worked with him for years. He was going to retire after this assignment. Go into private security, he had told her once. Plenty of money and none of the hassles. A man made it to forty, and he wanted a chance to enjoy just a few years danger free. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he was gone.</p><p>\u201cThere is a bomb under your car that was not there this morning,\u201d he told her then. \u201cDawg and Rowdy checked that car before we went out to it. I checked it before you got into it; do you remember that, Chay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly staring back at him as she tried to think, to figure out where and how and why.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone planted that bomb after you arrived here. Are you still safe, Chay? Did you check that motherfucking car before you got in it?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips slowly. \u201cI ran the transmitter over it. I always do that. I did it this morning. I used the mirror in my bag to look beneath it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was hidden,\u201d he snarled. \u201cDo you realize that? A pro put that bomb in there, sweetheart. Tell me, Chay; do you realize that?\u201d</p><p>His voice was rising, his hands tightening on her shoulders until she was afraid he might start shaking her.</p><p>\u201cNatches, I am neither a moron nor a candidate for suicide,\u201d she informed him coolly. \u201cI didn\u2019t find the bomb, which means it was well hidden and expertly placed. And someone has already taken out one of the other agents, so this assignment is severely in danger.\u201d She pulled her cell phone from her bag, flipped it open, pressed the secured speed dial and waited while he glared at her.</p> <p>\u201cCranston,\u201d Timothy barked into the phone.</p><p>\u201cWe just lost Denton to a car bomb. We\u2019re compromised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you with Mackay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatches, yes.\u201d She stared back at Natches.</p><p>\u201cKeep your ass there. I already have calls out to the other agents to park their vehicles immediately and contact the sheriff for pickup. I just received word myself. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>He disconnected and Chaya slowly flipped the phone closed.</p> <p>\u201cWho is he after?\u201d Natches snarled again.</p><p>\u201cMilitary intelligence and DHS have tracked the persons responsible for the hijacking and theft of military weapons, including those missiles, across the nation to a paramilitary group. Freedom\u2019s League. Five years ago, Freedom\u2019s League was hijacking and stealing weapons in Iraq as well. Their members are military and ex-military. They steal the weapons by hijacking them one at a time here and there, or in large shipments. Some they sell, evidently to fund other missions they undertake.</p><p>\u201cIt was Freedom\u2019s League members I was investigating when I was captured by Nassar in Iraq. It was those same members that executed a false order for those missiles to be launched on the hotel Craig and Beth were staying in when he was trying to escape. They\u2019ve managed to infiltrate the military to a degree that DHS is now desperate, and Timothy is rabid to capture one of their generals.</p><p>\u201cThe League is located in the eastern, southern, and western states, and their leaders are well trained and well organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you what. I asked you who,\u201d he snarled back, so furious she flinched.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who,\u201d she screamed back at him, her fists striking his chest to get away from him, to escape the ragged pain she could see in his eyes, that she could feel in her heart. \u201cIf I knew who, I would have killed him myself, and Cranston knows it.\u201d</p><p>She jerked around, staring out the windshield, watching as the other Mackays, the sheriff, and several deputies worked to tape off the area and roll other vehicles away from her rental car.</p><p>\u201cAll I know is that one of the head members of the League has been tracked here, through the operation with the missiles. The Swede attempting to buy the missiles finally made a deal with the government. In exchange for a lighter sentence, he gave them the information he had on this one buy. The League was involved and he was contacted by someone he trusted and had dealt with in the past. He wasn\u2019t originally contacted by Johnny Grace. He didn\u2019t know his name, didn\u2019t have a description, all he had was the fact that his contact had been in the military, and he was based here in Somerset, working within the League to gather the funds and the arms to launch a future revolution in America.\u201d</p> <p>She watched as Dawg and Rowdy rolled another car out of the way. The agents who were still at the hotel were now marking their vehicles, but it looked like four were out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in danger, Chay,\u201d he told her, his voice throbbing with his anger. \u201cThey obviously know why you\u2019re here and who you\u2019re after.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. I don\u2019t know who. I don\u2019t think Timothy knows. He makes his list night by night, his questions as well, based on the answers I pull in from each interview. You know how this works,\u201d she repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy process, and this link is the only one Timothy has managed to find in five years. If we can manage to identify one of the head members and take him alive, then we can bust the organization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil they re-form?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut even that takes time.\u201d She turned back to him, staring into his tormented eyes, seeing the same fears that plagued her. The fear of loss. \u201cSometimes, even a lifetime, Natches. We fight one battle at a time, as long as we can fight, then we turn the rest to the new generation and pray they\u2019re as diligent. What more can we do?\u201d</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>Four of the six agents\u2019 vehicles had been wired, Chaya\u2019s among them. Three of the four, including Denton, were assigned to watch the subjects after interview. It was obvious someone was getting spooked, and Chaya couldn\u2019t figure out how.</p><p>\u201cThe only questions we asked that could have possibly tripped anyone\u2019s radar were the ones involving the Mackay family,\u201d Chaya told the sheriff and Natches that afternoon as she sat in the back of the cruiser, headed for the last name on that morning\u2019s list.</p><p>Timothy Cranston had called and ordered the interviews for that day be completed. Natches hadn\u2019t been pleased, and Chaya knew he was only biding his time. She could feel the temper rising inside him as they drove toward one of the more popular nightclubs\u2014or bars, as Natches called them\u2014in town.</p><p>The sheriff pulled into the parking lot, and from the corner of her eye, she caught his grimace as he glanced toward the Harleys parked close to the building.</p><p>\u201cBiker bar?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cWe could only get so lucky.\u201d He shook his head as Natches moved from the front of the car and opened the back door for her.</p><p>\u201cEver been in a honky-tonk, sweetheart?\u201d Natches asked her then.</p><p>Chaya stared around the parking lot and shook her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with honky-tonks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question is: What\u2019s not wrong with them?\u201d The sheriff sighed as he jammed his hat down on his head, his expression intimidating. \u201cWho\u2019s on the damned list for this place anyway?\u201d</p><p>She pulled the small notebook from her pocket and glanced at the name. It was cute. \u201cRogue Walker.\u201d</p><p>She nearly bounced into Natches\u2019s back as he came to a hard stop, turned, and stared over her head at the sheriff. Swinging around, Chaya got a glimpse of complete male horror a second before it was gone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cute name,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cLord have mercy on us,\u201d Sheriff Mayes muttered before Natches gripped her arm and led her to the door.</p><p>\u201cTry not to piss her off,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Chaya would have grinned at the suggestion if her nerves weren\u2019t still rattled over Denton\u2019s death and the bombs they had found in the vehicles the agents drove. Someone was definitely trying to send a message. That person didn\u2019t like the questions and was going to put a stop to them.</p><p>\u201cThe file Cranston sent stated that Ms. Walker\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call her miz nothin\u2019,\u201d Natches interrupted. \u201cCall her Rogue. Period. Don\u2019t comment on her clothes, her hair, or her motorcycle, and no matter what you do, don\u2019t even hint at mentioning her past employment.\u201d</p><p>Chaya stopped and stared up at him with a frown. \u201cShe was a schoolteacher; what\u2019s so bad about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord help us if you ask about it,\u201d he muttered. \u201cLet\u2019s get this the hell over with. If fists start flying, get back to the cruiser. We\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah, she just bet he would be. He was probably praying for a fight to get rid of some of that testosterone.</p><p>Shaking her head, she followed him into the bar and picked out the subject immediately.</p><p>Dressed in black pants, boots, and a snug vest, Ms. Rogue Walker was tipping a beer to her lips and glancing to the door in boredom.</p><p>Long golden red hair cascaded down her back in thick ringlets; pale creamy flesh was accentuated by the black attire and gave her an almost feyish appearance. She was slender but curvy. Full breasts pressed against the front of the vest, and deep, pretty violet eyes widened before a sharp, disinterested mask descended over her face and she turned away.</p><p>Interesting. Chaya looked back at Natches. \u201cA former conquest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven I wasn\u2019t that damned brave,\u201d he growled. \u201cNow get this over with so we can leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, get a beer, park your butt at the bar with the sheriff, and leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed hold of her arm, keeping her from turning away as his head lowered, his eyes darkening in irritation. \u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter happen.\u201d She smiled tightly. \u201cOr else? I can do \u2018or else\u2019 really well, Natches, and I can make it stick. This is the wrong place to decide to take over, and it\u2019s definitely the wrong place for a public quarrel.\u201d She jerked her arm out of his hold and tried to tamp down the adrenaline still racing through her. It made her cranky and it made it more difficult for her to hold on to the patience she knew she needed right now. \u201cI\u2019ll just be a few minutes. You can see me perfectly fine while having a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when I get you home we\u2019re going to have a talk about this \u2018do it your way\u2019 crap,\u201d he said, scowling. \u201cFirst thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She nodded. \u201cFirst thing. I\u2019ll be ready for you. Are we doing it naked or clothed?\u201d</p><p>Before he could do more than narrow his eyes on her, she turned and moved down the bar to where Rogue Walker was watching the confrontation with interest now.</p><p>\u201cI wondered when you would get to me,\u201d she said as Chaya stepped to her.</p><p>Her voice was beautiful. Chaya cocked her head to the side and stared at the petite woman. She was a few inches shorter than Chaya\u2019s five feet seven inches, and much smaller boned.</p><p>\u201cDo you sing?\u201d Chaya asked her as she lifted herself onto one of the barstools and turned to face the other girl.</p><p>\u201cIn the shower,\u201d she said suggestively, running her eyes over Chaya. \u201cWant to hear me?\u201d</p><p>Strange, Rogue Walker\u2019s file hadn\u2019t said anything about an alternate lifestyle. Or a lover of any type.</p><p>\u201cNatches gets jealous.\u201d She sighed mockingly.</p><p>Rogue rolled her eyes. \u201cAs many games as that man played before he left for the Marines, he has no right to jealousy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes any man?\u201d Chaya countered.</p><p>Rogue laughed, a soft, amused sound. \u201cNo, they don\u2019t, Agent Dane. But I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not why you came here to talk to me. I assume this has something to do with that little bastard Johnny Grace?\u201d</p><p>Chaya pulled the digital recorder from her jacket pocket and laid it on the bar. \u201cI need to record this,\u201d she told the other woman.</p><p>Rogue shrugged. \u201cI sound like crap on it, but whatever.\u201d She lifted the beer to her lips and sipped as Chaya set the recorder and stated the date, time, and subject.</p><p>\u201cFor the record, your name is . . .\u201d</p><p>Rogue stopped her by laying her hand over the recorder and staring at her hard. \u201cI imagine you know my full name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cState it and we\u2019re going to fight. My name is Rogue Walker, period. Understood?\u201d</p><p>Chaya inclined her head. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t state my age, please.\u201d Her smile was all teeth. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chaya didn\u2019t know the game this girl was playing, and she didn\u2019t care. When Rogue lifted her hand, Chaya continued, as requested, and received Rogue\u2019s affirmation that she was aware she was being recorded.</p><p>\u201cFor the record,\u201d Rogue drawled mockingly. \u201cI thought Johnny Grace was a teeny-tiny little maggot that needed to be blown away, so you\u2019re looking to the wrong person if you think I was helping him.\u201dIl</p><p>\u201cWho would have helped him?\u201d Chaya kept her voice low enough to keep those around from listening.</p> <p>Rogue shrugged. \u201cHis uncle Dayle. He\u2019s a son of a bitch, but I\u2019m sure Natches told you that. He wouldn\u2019t have helped kill soldiers or steal weapons though. Dayle Mackay likes to knock the women around, and he likes to run his mouth about politics, but he wouldn\u2019t sell missiles to terrorists unless he had them rigged to blow them to hell and back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Johnny\u2019s mother?\u201d</p><p>Rogue sneered maliciously. \u201cThe only thing that bitch knows how to do is fuck her brother. Johnny got drunk one night right before he died and decided I should know that. Dayle tells her what to do, and she does it. She doesn\u2019t make many moves without Dayle\u2019s permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Johnny did?\u201d</p><p>Rogue stared across the bar as she tipped the beer to her lips and narrowed her eyes thoughtfully. Finally she set the bottle back on the bar and shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cI would have said no, but it appears he did.\u201d She shrugged again.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you have said that?\u201d Chaya asked.</p><p>Rogue pursed her lips. \u201cJohnny was a weaselly little thing. He craved male attention and approval. I wouldn\u2019t have thought he would have done that, simply because his uncle Dayle would have been disappointed in him. And he couldn\u2019t have borne that. It was bad enough when Dayle found out he was gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened when his uncle found out he was gay?\u201d</p><p>Rogue tapped a fingernail against the bar, frowning down at the movement for long moments. \u201cJohnny didn\u2019t walk for weeks,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI kind of felt sorry for him, went to the house to check on him.\u201d She shook her head on a bitter laugh. \u201cDayle had beat him from head to toe. Johnny was in a dress, stockings, and a wig. Said it was his punishment.\u201d Disgust marked her expression. \u201cDamn, sometimes I wonder why I don\u2019t just go ahead and move back to Boston. You know better than to get involved with people there.\u201d</p><p>Chaya glanced around the bar. There weren\u2019t many customers, but those who were there seemed to keep an eye on Rogue. And Chaya.</p> <p>\u201cDid Johnny spend much time in bars?\u201d she asked the other woman then.</p><p>Rogue shook her head. \u201cNot really. Johnny was the home-and-hearth type. I guess that\u2019s why it surprised a lot of us when we found out what he\u2019d done. He didn\u2019t seem the type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t care that you\u2019re telling me all this?\u201d Chaya injected. \u201cGetting people around here to talk hasn\u2019t been easy. Yet you\u2019re more than willing.\u201d</p><p>Rogue smiled. A wicked upturn of Cupid\u2019s bow lips, and eyes filled with cynical amusement. \u201cLady, this county holds no love for me, or me for it.\u201d Bitterness flashed in her eyes. \u201cThe only difference between me and the fine upstanding citizens of this town is that I tell the truth as I see it. Let\u2019s see. Example. I bet a half dozen spiteful little bitches are going to tell you, if they haven\u2019t already, how hard they partied with Natches the weekend before you lit back into town.\u201d She smiled gleefully. \u201cI can tell you Natches hasn\u2019t snacked on any homegrown offerings since he came back from the Marines. Now, the good sheriff over there? Widowed at a young age, he sampled the fine pleasures of one Janice Lowell just last week. And from what I hear, he\u2019s a real go-getter. An all-nighter.\u201d She leaned over and waved at the sheriff over her shoulder.</p><p>Chaya glanced back and was surprised to see Sheriff Mayes watching the other woman with narrow-eyed disapproval.</p><p>\u201cHe does the whole good-cop routine so well.\u201d Rogue sighed elaborately.</p><p>\u201cWhat else can you tell me?\u201d Chaya asked her then.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you a lot of women want to claw your eyes out. Weekend gossip is so much fun. And I can tell you that one of your agents\u2014\u201d She paused and shook her head, the brittle amusement dropping for a second. \u201cHell of a way to go. I heard he was killed this morning and several others almost went up in flames as well. What do you want me to tell you, Agent Dane?\u201d The mocking, devil-may-care grin was back.</p> <p>\u201cWho was pulling Johnny\u2019s strings? Even better, who set the bombs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I knew, I\u2019d be barbeque, too.\u201d Rogue grimaced. \u201cAll I hear is a little gossip here and there.\u201d She shook her head, the tiny bells at her ears chiming softly. \u201cThe Mackay family is damned weird though. Ray, he\u2019s a good guy, so are Dawg, Rowdy, and Natches. I didn\u2019t know Chandler before he died, thank God, but I know he and Dayle were having one major fight the night Chandler and his wife were killed. And I know Nadine Mackay Grace and Dayle like to get the nasty on a little too often.\u201d Her smile was all teeth; her eyes were bitter and much too cynical. \u201cIf I had known anything more, trust me, one of the Mackay cousins would have known, because there\u2019s nothing in this world I would have loved better than bringing down Nadine Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Sometimes that was the most important question a person could ask.</p><p>Rogue picked at the label on the bottle of beer, then reached over and turned the recorder off.</p><p>\u201cInterview over,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Chaya picked up the recorder, transferred it back to her pocket, and watched Rogue expectantly. \u201cJust between us girls then,\u201d she told her. \u201cWhat did Nadine do to you?\u201d</p><p>Rogue glanced at where Natches and the sheriff sat, then turned her eyes back to Chaya. Somehow she wasn\u2019t surprised to see the hollow pain reflected within them.</p><p>\u201cShe helped create me,\u201d Rogue said then, her voice low and haunting. \u201cOne of these days, I\u2019ll get to remind her of that. Create a monster, and it can come back and bite you in the ass. Isn\u2019t that true, Agent Dane?\u201d</p><p>Chaya nodded slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s very true, Rogue. Very true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatches, you\u2019re making a mistake here,\u201d Zeke muttered as they watched the two women. They couldn\u2019t hear the words, but a look told a thousand tales. \u201cYou need to pull her out of this.\u201d</p><p>Rogue, the one woman who men in three counties feared on a daily basis, almost blushed, and she softened. She looked younger; her gaze twinkled in humor. Then her expression shifted again, sorrow, and then bitterness. Natches swore that in the years he had known her, which hadn\u2019t been many, he\u2019d rarely seen anything but hard, mocking amusement in her eyes.</p><p>As he watched Chaya though, his chest clenched. He\u2019d been ready to tie her to his bed and force her out of this. Make her swear she would duck and hide until this was over and let him deal with the mess Cranston was creating.</p><p>But as he watched her, he remembered crashing into that filthy little dirt cell in Iraq. The smell of blood and death had filled the cramped area, but there had been Chaya, crouched, a gun in her hand, dressed in her tormentor\u2019s uniform.</p><p>Her eyes had been so swollen there had been no way she could have seen out of them. Her feet had been ragged, though he hadn\u2019t known that at the time. She had been so bruised and mauled, he\u2019d seen his own life flash before his eyes. Because he couldn\u2019t have left her, and there hadn\u2019t been a chance he could\u2019ve carried her out of there.</p><p>But she had run. There had been no tears, only strength. No excuses, no recriminations. She had fought to live and fought to fight, and it was those qualities that had first stolen his heart.</p><p>And he thought he could take that from her now?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my job,\u201d he finally murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your job to protect her, damn it,\u201d Zeke cursed.</p><p>And to that, Natches nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to watch her back while she does her job. You don\u2019t change what you love, Zeke, or you never loved it to begin with.\u201d</p><p>He had fallen in love with the agent. Strong, independent, fiercely determined. Take those things away from her, and she wasn\u2019t Chaya. She wouldn\u2019t be his heart or his soul, and that he couldn\u2019t allow.</p><p>Natches escorted Chaya back to his houseboat after the interview, the tension burning hot and heavy through them.</p><p>\u201cThe boat has been checked thoroughly,\u201d he told her as they walked along the floating docks toward it. \u201cAlex hit town a few hours ago. He and his team went over it from top to bottom while we were on our way in.\u201d</p><p>Alex Jansen was Special Forces and worked closely with Cranston. Chaya had worked with him several times. He was also Crista Mackay\u2019s brother.</p><p>It was already dark and growing bitterly cold for the season. The wind off the water felt like ice and cut through Chaya\u2019s thick jacket like the sharpest blade.</p><p>She felt cold from the inside out. As though icicles were growing in the pit of her stomach and freezing her with fear.</p><p>What the hell was going on in this beautiful little county? A place where young men were punished in such horrible ways for their sexual preferences, where young women, like twenty-four-year-old Rogue, were more cynical than women twice their ages. And agents, good men, family men, were being targeted to die in an inferno.</p><p>\u201cAlex and his team are at Dawg\u2019s right now.\u201d Natches\u2019s voice was low, restrained. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait till later to meet with them. After you\u2019ve had a chance to rest and eat. You haven\u2019t eaten today, Chay.\u201d</p><p>Was that concern in his voice? God, she didn\u2019t want to hear the gentleness in his voice when she knew he was furious. Probably furious with her. She was furious with herself. She hadn\u2019t taken the proper precautions. Somehow, she had missed something during the interviews she had conducted. An expression, a flash of maliciousness, a lie. There were always signs. Always. It was always there, in the eyes, in the small shifts of the face, and she had missed it. And because she had, Kyle was dead.</p><p>Cranston had arrived in town as she left the bar. The text message had flashed on her phone, warning her that he would meet with her the next morning. On Natches\u2019s houseboat. She hadn\u2019t told Natches yet.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby.\u201d His voice was a breath of warmth against her ear as he unlocked the door and they stepped into the heated interior.</p><p>After locking the door behind them, he slid her jacket from her shoulders and unclipped her weapon from her side.</p><p>\u201cYou need a shoulder harness for this.\u201d He laid the holstered gun on the jacket at the end of the couch.</p><p>Chaya stared at the gun for long moments. She hated it. She hated carrying it, she hated being tied to it, and she hated the life she had led for the last five years. God, the last ten years. The only part of her life that had seemed worthwhile was the time with Beth. And with Natches.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThey aren\u2019t comfortable.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to turn to him, she wanted to beg him to hold her, to take away the pain, and she couldn\u2019t. She was the agent, this was the life she had chosen. What right did she have to burden him with her regrets now? He would only feel as though he should fix it, somehow drag her from it, and now she couldn\u2019t let it go.</p><p>\u201cChay.\u201d His arms came around her as she felt her throat tightening with emotion. \u201cI have you.\u201d</p><p>His head rested against hers, and his warmth surrounded her.</p><p>\u201cI need a shower.\u201d She pulled away from him. \u201cDo you want to order dinner? I could probably fix something when I get finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow domestic.\u201d He let her go, though his tone grated on her nerves, that hint of knowledge, patience, and just a tinge of condescending male. \u201cI do know how to cook, Chay,\u201d he told her a second later as he breathed out roughly. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing it for a while now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSince your father threw you out of your home.\u201d She turned on him, feeling it burn in her now, that icy rage. Nearly everyone she had spoke to knew about it, mentioned it, seemed to wallow in the dirty gossip and nasty stories they thought they knew.</p><p>\u201cIt was never my home,\u201d he said simply. \u201cIt was a place to crash for a night or two.\u201d</p><p>He said that so simply, as though it didn\u2019t even matter.</p> <p>\u201cThe scars on your back? He beat you senseless . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he managed it that time.\u201d His grin was smug if tinged with bitterness. \u201cHe has a few scars on his back now though. What the hell is this, Chay? I was barely twenty years old. We got into a fight over my sister and ended up fistfighting. He had the bigger fists at the time. Too bad, so sad. I survived it.\u201d He shook his head and stared at her in confusion. \u201cIf you want to crucify Dayle Mackay, I\u2019ll be the first in line to help you, but that\u2019s not what this is all about.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t. It was about the fact that he had every intention of jerking her out of that bar. That he had informed her, quite bluntly, that they would be discussing it when they returned here.</p><p>Well, she was ready to discuss it now.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t yelled at me yet, and I\u2019m sick of waiting on it.\u201d Her hands were shaking with nerves, with reaction. \u201cGo ahead and do it and get it over with. I should have come straight back here this morning, right? I should just let you take care of all the pesky little details of my job and of protecting me. Go ahead. Say it.\u201d She waved her hand back at him as she felt the tears trying to fill her eyes. \u201cGet it off your chest.\u201d</p> <p>She was yelling. She was irrational. She had never been irrational in her life but as Natches stared back at her with that expression of patient male understanding, she wanted to scream. Men didn\u2019t understand. They didn\u2019t feel the same things, they didn\u2019t hurt the same way. They didn\u2019t fear the same things. And she knew damned good and well he hadn\u2019t understood anything when they entered that bar.</p><p>\u201cSo. Let me get this straight.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest and tilted his head, watching her curiously. \u201cI should be chewing on your ass for doing your job? Despite the fact that it just impressed the fucking hell out me. Kind of like it did in that damned desert. Now, suddenly, I\u2019m supposed to change everything about you that made me so crazy about you to begin with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want me to go,\u201d she snapped back. \u201cYou were ready to tie me up and drag me back here.\u201d</p><p>He infuriated her as he nodded slowly. \u201cYes, I was. Until I remembered this is who you are. You couldn\u2019t walk away now even if I demanded it. No more than I could. I don\u2019t want to change that part of you, Chay.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her fingers through her hair and turned her back on him.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you angry with me?\u201d She turned back to him a second later. \u201cI could be carrying your child and I went out there anyway. I finished those interviews knowing someone wanted me dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I made sure you did what you had to do, while I watched your back,\u201d he said simply. \u201cChay, I don\u2019t want a lapdog. If I wanted a woman willing to say yes to everything I wanted I could have had it two hundred times over by now. I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She clenched her fists at her side as that anger poured through her. \u201cWhy do you want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, do I have to have a damned reason?\u201d he fired back. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Chay, because you know how to stand up to me? Because you know how to live? You know how to love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stopped. \u201cYou don\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to love, Natches.\u201d She felt the tremors shaking through her body then. Deep, hard shudders, the ice building, tightening inside her until she wondered if she could ever be warm again.</p><p>He smiled then. That slow, wicked smile that sent a flame shooting through the ice and a ragged tremor of response ripping through her senses.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s why you need me then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She did need him. She needed him until she couldn\u2019t breathe without the thought of him. And she still couldn\u2019t fathom how to deal with it.</p><p>\u201cTo show you how to recognize all that love burning within you,\u201d he answered.</p><p>He moved to her, stalking across the room until she had to look up to hold his gaze, to stay connected to the only security she had found in all the years she had lived.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d She needed to know where it was, how to open it, and how to set it free.</p><p>\u201cAh, Chay,\u201d he whispered, framing her face, his lips brushing against hers. \u201cIt\u2019s all just right here, baby. Burning inside you. All you\u2019ve got to do is let it burn.\u201d</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>Natches wanted to kill. As God was his witness, the moment those shattered honey gold eyes locked with his after they entered the houseboat, he wanted to kill.</p><p>He wanted to make her dead husband, Craig, die again. He wanted to make Nassar Mallah suffer. He wanted to beat Cranston to a bloody pulp and he wanted to rip whoever had dared to kill Denton, limb from limb.</p><p>He wanted their blood to wash over his hands, but even more, he wanted to ease the haunting pain from Chaya\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d he said, keeping his voice low and gentle. \u201cRunning on nothing but coffee and a few donuts. Shaking in my arms and staring at me so fiercely. I bet if your eyes hadn\u2019t been swollen shut when I rescued you, I would have seen that same will to fight in them then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not what you see. I\u2019m not that strong.\u201d</p><p>He flashed her a wicked smile, because he knew better. A smile as smug and confident as any self-appointed sensualist had ever given a woman. And it succeeded in bringing a flush to her face, a glitter of anger to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou think you know everything.\u201d She pushed at his chest, as though he was actually going to let her go now. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that. \u201cBaby, I watched your back and let you fight. I took you into the baddest honky-tonk in three counties and sat at the bar like the good little boy I was told to be. This is my territory now. I don\u2019t have to be a good boy here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if you\u2019ve ever been a good boy,\u201d she snorted and tried to twist in his arms.</p><p>Natches chuckled at that. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a good boy with you, Chay. I let you run every time you wanted to run, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not letting me run now,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAnd all I want to run to is the damned shower.\u201d</p><p>He held her easily, letting her twist, letting that sleek little body stroke and rub against his. His cock was rock hard, it had been ever since he had watched her in that damned bar.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to wrap her in his arms and rock her, and at the same time he wanted to fuck her until she knew to the bottom of her soul exactly who she belonged to.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m tired of being a good boy today.\u201d He grinned and dipped his head, stealing a kiss before she could do more than gasp in protest.</p><p>As she struggled, he managed to wrestle her shirt off her. She had changed clothes at the hotel, but he realized her luggage was likely up in smoke somewhere. The bomb squad had set several of those suckers off just to match the debris with the dead agent\u2019s car.</p><p>The thought of how close she had come to going up in flames as well had his hands trembling as he held her hips against him and took another kiss. A deeper kiss.</p><p>Hell, if he didn\u2019t forget the bone-chilling fear he felt when he realized her car was rigged to blow, then he might disintegrate from the inside out.</p><p>\u201cNatches.\u201d Her voice was more a breathy moan now. \u201cYou have to stop this. I have to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thinking allowed here.\u201d</p><p>He let her struggle, let her twist until she turned and met the edge of the bar that separated the living room and kitchen. And then he pressed her shoulders down.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to go for slow and easy tonight. Slow and easy would come later. Right now, he was burning alive for her.</p><p>He loosened her jeans and dragged them over that very shapely ass. The prettiest ass in fifty states he swore as he hurriedly released his own jeans and freed the tormented length of his erection.</p><p>Fucking her was ecstasy, and he couldn\u2019t do without it much longer.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Breathless, hot, her voice washed over him. She wasn\u2019t protesting, she was losing herself in it, just as he always lost himself in her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make a little Natches, remember?\u201d He tucked the head of his cock against the swollen, saturated folds of her pussy before pressing into her.</p><p>Damn. It was like pressing into a living flame. Natches groaned, feeling sweat coat his flesh as she burned him alive. He worked his cock farther inside her, feeling her tighten around him, feeling the delicate muscles of her vagina milking and caressing his sensitive flesh.</p><p>Nothing was this good. There was no pleasure on earth that could ever be as good as taking Chaya like this. When she reached back for him, her short, neat little nails digging into his thigh, he gave her more. Slow, easy strokes that buried him inside her a little at a time. Gave him a chance to relish every ripple of response around the ultrasensitive head of his cock.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Natches,\u201d she cursed him even as she tugged at his thigh, trying to force him deeper.</p><p>Her voice was thick, a feminine little growl of demand that had him grinning with the pleasure of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You want me to stop?\u201d He stopped. Buried halfway inside her, his cock head throbbing, dying for more.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d she cried out.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Good thing one of us is sane then.\u201d He leaned forward and laid a row of kisses between her shoulder blades. \u201cOur kid needs at least one sane parent. You be the sane one.\u201d He pressed in farther.</p><p>He felt the wash of her juices and had to grit his teeth to hold back his release. His balls had drawn tight against the base of his shaft, electric sparks of sensation racing from them with the need to come.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Natches, we can\u2019t keep keeping doing this.\u201d She was breathing hard now, panting little breaths that assured him that she was as far gone to the pleasure as he was.</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d Sweat trickled along his temple as she burned him clear to his soul.</p><p>\u201cTalking babies.\u201d</p><p>His hips shifted and he drove another inch inside her, quick and hard, and gritted his teeth as she arched, a hungry little moan begging him for more.</p><p>\u201cThe thought of giving you babies makes me harder,\u201d he panted. Hell, the thought of her breathing made him harder. He stayed hard between each release at just the hope of having more of her.</p><p>\u201cEverything makes you harder,\u201d she gasped, and he had to laugh.</p><p>\u201cEverything about you makes me harder.\u201d He drew back, the head of his cock poised just inside her liquid heat before he forged inside again.</p><p>A throttled, feminine wail filled the air as he took her again. Pushing deep inside her, pausing and drawing back, only to push inside her again. Impaling her with slow strokes, then one fast hard thrust that pinned her to the table and had her trying to scream his name.</p><p>\u201cDid you get those condoms today?\u201d He could barely think, let alone talk. But it was the love play she needed tonight. That, and the slow realization that it was going to happen. She was going to belong to him. All of her.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she cursed, but there was no anger, an edge of laughter, maybe.</p><p>\u201cOh, man, that\u2019s too bad, Chay.\u201d His hands clenched on her hips as he drew back.</p><p>\u201cNatches, don\u2019t you dare stop,\u201d she cried out, panic filling her voice. \u201cOh God, please, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a chance.</p><p>He thrust inside her to the hilt, snarled at the pleasure that bordered pain as he forced himself to stop, to hold deep inside her. To feel her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was close to orgasm. Her pussy was clenching around his shaft, stroking the sensitive head, rippling over him like a thousand hungry little fingers caressing him at once.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good.\u201d He leaned into her, kissed the shell of her ear then drew the lobe between his teeth to worry it erotically. \u201cSo tight and hot around me. I could stay inside you forever, feeling you come for me, over and over again, Chay.\u201d</p><p>He could feel the perspiration coating both their bodies now. Her nails were digging into his thigh, a sharp little pain to keep him centered amid the pleasure.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ready for me, Chay? I\u2019m going to take you hard. I\u2019m going to take you so hard and deep you\u2019ll think you\u2019re dying. Then, before the last tremor is gone, I\u2019m going to take you again. Over and over again, until you feel all that love burning and heating inside you. You hear me, sweetheart? We\u2019re going to find all that love.\u201d</p><p>She cried out his name. The sound of her voice, dazed and thick with the pleasure he was giving her, was almost, just almost, enough to send him over the edge right then. He had to clench his teeth, had to fight to hold back his release. But he knew holding back wasn\u2019t going to happen for long.</p><p>Gripping her hips firmly, he began to move. He started slow and easy, but slow and easy wasn\u2019t what either of them needed. She needed to burn through her pain and he needed to guide her through the heat. He needed to feel her come apart around him, shattering with the ecstasy as she shattered with hers.</p><p>Within seconds, the thrusts built. He was slamming against her, burying his cock inside her with blinding, furious strokes as she begged for more. For harder. Harder, stronger, until he heard her wail fill his head and felt her pussy, like a fist tightening on his cock, milking it, pulling his release from him, tearing through him with fire and lightning.</p><p>\u201cAh hell!\u201d He barely recognized his own voice. \u201cChay. Ah God, baby, yes, take it. Take all of me.\u201d</p> <p>He poured himself into her as he felt the contractions of her pussy spill her release around him. Deep, violent spurts of semen tore from the head of his cock, the racing pleasure tearing through his body as he thrust against her, buried himself deeper, and felt stars exploding in his head as she cried out his name.</p><p>He collapsed over her, his knees weak, and damn if he wasn\u2019t starting to feel as exhausted as she had looked earlier.</p><p>The contractions flexing around his cock were easing, and as he kissed her shoulder, he smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, sweetheart?\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She was boneless beneath him, sated, relaxing.</p><p>\u201cYou know you are so pregnant now, don\u2019t you?\u201d Pride flared deep and strong inside him, and he swore he was growing hard again. \u201cSee? I told you, the thought of making babies with you just makes me harder.\u201d</p> <p>No sooner had Chaya showered and eaten the impromptu meal Natches had waiting for her than his family converged on them. Rowdy and his wife, Kelly; Dawg and his wife, Crista; and their uncle Ray and his wife, Maria. And Crista\u2019s brother, Alex Jansen.</p><p>Chaya knew Alex Jansen fairly well\u2014he was better known as Timothy Cranston\u2019s muscle, though Chaya doubted the Mackays knew that. And from the warning look he had thrown her, he didn\u2019t want it known, either.</p><p>Oh, how tangled this little web was becoming. She knew Alex could report back to Timothy and cause her more trouble than she wanted to face, but she also knew the man\u2019s incredible loyalty to his little sister, Crista.</p><p>Which way would Alex\u2019s loyalty swing in this one though?</p><p>As the men converged on the beers Natches had stacked in an ice-filled cooler and the women came bearing snacks, sandwiches, and chips, Chaya got a look into the relationships between the Mackays, their wives, and the uncle that had more or less raised all of them.</p><p>Ray Mackay was the complete opposite of his brothers or sister. He loved his son and his nephews, he was incredibly protective over all of them, and the loyalty and warmth seemed to extend around Alex as well. And maybe even Chaya herself.</p><p>He had hugged her as he walked in, patted her shoulder, and told her not to worry, the Mackays were going to take care of everything.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted to grin at the proclamation, but she had a feeling he was entirely too serious.</p> <p>Now, as she sat back and watched the men going through the printed reports Natches had taken from her laptop, she had a moment to worry about involving any of them. If something were to happen to even one of them, it would affect the whole family. And it wouldn\u2019t just affect them; it would devastate them.</p><p>\u201cThe subjects you questioned were all ex-military members.\u201d Rowdy cast her a narrow-eyed look from across the wide table as he laid down the file he had been going through. He flipped two files toward her. \u201cHollister Mcgrew.\u201d</p><p>Chaya stared at the picture clipped to the corner of the file. Hollister Mcgrew\u2019s pitted face, framed by limp brown hair and sporting a bullish look, stared back at her. He and Johnny had been reported to have been friends in high school, and later had run and drunk together in many of the local bars before Hollister signed up for the Army.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t gay, actually considered himself quite the ladies\u2019 man, despite his rotting front teeth and sour breath. His honorable discharge from the Army had been medical. Hollister hadn\u2019t handled the Army well.</p><p>\u201cGeorge Mack.\u201d Rowdy tossed out another file.</p><p>Pole skinny with straight, thinning brown hair and dirt brown eyes. For a few years, he and Johnny had been best friends, until George had joined the Navy. As with Hollister, George lasted only the first tour before receiving discharge, though his had been less than honorable. He\u2019d nearly ended up in Leavenworth.</p><p>There were others. Many of them were rumored to be involved in drugs, grand theft, or burglary. The few who weren\u2019t ex-military, such as Rogue Walker, a former friend of Johnny\u2019s, were persons of interest who may or may not have had information tying Johnny to other persons of interest.</p><p>\u201cJohnny was the one who admitted to masterminding the whole deal,\u201d she pointed out, playing devil\u2019s advocate.</p><p>\u201cNone of them had the brains or connections to have helped Johnny put everything together, nor could they have kept their dirty little paws off a million in cash,\u201d Alex stated. \u201cThey are the pawns. Who\u2019s the king?\u201d</p><p>That was a good question. Chaya pushed her fingers through her hair in frustration. That one she hadn\u2019t figured out yet.</p><p>\u201cThey have ties to others as well,\u201d she stated. \u201cThe mayor and chief of police. George Mack is Mayor Sunders\u2019s second cousin. Hollister worked for Sunders as a handyman for several weeks. The same pattern follows for everyone I\u2019ve questioned. I received three to five names each day as well as their most likely locations or residences. And the questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe questions aren\u2019t that hard,\u201d Dawg snorted. \u201cAnd it\u2019s damned easy to lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sometimes, it\u2019s damned easy to see that lie.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been trained to see the lies. I\u2019m an interrogation specialist, Dawg. This is what I do well.\u201d</p><p>She had been lied to quite a bit during the questioning, and the knowledge of that had gone into the notes she sent to Cranston each evening. The same notes everyone here now held.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one here Johnny would have trusted,\u201d Ray told them all as he looked through the files. \u201cHe was a strange boy, but trust wasn\u2019t something he gave easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust was something he traded with,\u201d Natches said, his voice curiously bland. \u201cJohnny only trusted his mother and Dayle. And we know Nadine would lie out of her ass if it got her something she wanted. Dayle\u2019s no better.\u201d</p><p>That was his father, but there wasn\u2019t so much as a hint of emotion in his voice.</p><p>\u201cCranston\u2019s arriving here in the morning,\u201d she told them. \u201cI received his message before we returned to the boat. I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll have more answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d suggest he come bearing answers.\u201d Natches\u2019s more dangerous drawl was back now. If Timothy didn\u2019t have answers, then he was going to have to deal with more than one pissed-off Mackay.</p><p>\u201cSeveral of these boys were military, too,\u201d Alex noticed. \u201cThe team we captured after Johnny\u2019s death was all ex-military. Penny-ante troublemakers, none of them did well there, but thought they were Rambo once they came home.</p><p>\u201cThe group we\u2019re after, Freedom\u2019s League, uses such men to help steal the weapons they\u2019ve targeted. But the League has never attempted to sell something so powerful to terrorists before.</p><p>\u201cThe few times they managed to steal weapons of any strength, DHS was there to stop the sales. Smaller caches the agents allowed to slip by as they worked to identify and capture those heading the militia group.</p><p>\u201cIf the League was involved, then it would have been a hit. They would have taken out the Swede and his group, and they would have used men better able to pull the operation off,\u201d Alex stated.</p><p>And Crista agreed with that\u2014to a point.</p><p>\u201cExcept the Swedish broker has, according to evidence he turned over, worked with the contact in this area before. The missiles went cheap. Two million?\u201d She scoffed. \u201cGive me a break, they could have gotten twenty million for them. And that was the intention. The broker was only buying the rights to transport and arrange auction on the missiles. And that was what Johnny didn\u2019t know. He thought the missile sale was a done deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means someone was pulling the strings somewhere else,\u201d Natches mused, sitting back in his chair and staring at the papers on the table before lifting his eyes to Chaya.</p><p>She saw the bitterness now, the anger.</p><p>\u201cEach step we take points in that direction,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cFucking Somerset, Kentucky, a hotbed of illegal militia sales and homegrown terrorism.\u201d A cynical laugh passed his lips. \u201cSon of a bitch, boys.\u201d He looked to his cousins. \u201cHave we been sleeping or what?\u201d</p><p>Chaya shook her head, aching for him. This was his home, and she knew his love for the mountains, the lake, and even in some part, the people.</p><p>\u201cSomerset is only one of many small towns,\u201d she told him. \u201cThe guerilla militias can grow and thrive in such areas, because of their family and community ties. They know who to target, who they can trust and who they can blackmail. Most of them are harmless. Good ole boys plotting to defend God and country against aggressors. They have ties to military personnel, gain a few weapons here and there, and it makes them feel safer. Doesn\u2019t make it legal, but they feel safer. Then, every now and then, you get something like FL. And they twist it, pull in those once harmless groups, and suddenly they have an army with ties all across America. If we could capture the person or persons pulling the strings here in Somerset, then there\u2019s a chance we could take the entire network down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think asking a few dipshits some sticky questions is going to do this?\u201d Dawg flipped his hand over the files in disgust. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a damned thing in there about Freedom\u2019s League or a network of homegrown terrorists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t read her file,\u201d Natches told him quietly, his gaze still locked with hers. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Chaya pressed her lips and dropped her eyes. She had asked the questions she knew could come back on Natches and his father. How loyal was he to his father? He claimed he wasn\u2019t, but family ties often had strong undercurrents. And Natches wasn\u2019t always as easy to read as he pretended to be. In some areas, his secrets went far deeper than most people could imagine.</p><p>\u201cThe questions Cranston is sending to me now are becoming more specific. Centered on Johnny, his friendships, and his ties. And there are certain threads that bind each one. Johnny\u2019s parentage.\u201d She watched Dawg\u2019s jaw bunch. \u201cHis loyalties. His friends. Who he associated with the most, because within those groups, we\u2019ll find the contact we need.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot in that group of names you won\u2019t,\u201d Rowdy snorted. \u201cI\u2019ve gone over these files, Agent Dane. There\u2019s nothing here to identify any kind of leader of a homegrown militia network. These people are misfits. They can\u2019t decide where to use the bathroom next and you expect me to believe they\u2019re part of some growing grassroots terrorist group?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more inclined to believe they\u2019re the pawns of such a group,\u201d she snapped back. \u201cI\u2019ve worked this case for five years, Rowdy. I know the signs. And they\u2019re all here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho in Somerset could organize and lead something like this?\u201d Dawg looked to the others then his eyes flashed with anger as he leaned toward her. \u201cFucking Mackays. Me, Rowdy, Natches, we could do it,\u201d he snarled. \u201cIs Cranston after our asses now?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d His hand slapped the table. \u201cThere\u2019s no one in this county with more expertise in military, paramilitary, or plain dirt-assed killing than the three of us.\u201d</p><p>A sniper assassin, an explosives assassin, and Rowdy, one of the Marines\u2019 finest commanders. They\u2019d all left the military early. For Dawg and Natches, after one tour, both with medical discharges. Rowdy had taken two tours and signed out. No sooner had they returned than the League had begun growing within the area.</p><p>\u201cI investigated that option myself,\u201d she told them, staring back at Dawg coolly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the ties nor do you personally have the temperament needed for such work.\u201d</p><p>He almost gaped back at her, rising halfway from his chair as Natches stood fully to his feet.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I don\u2019t have the temper for it, little girl,\u201d he snarled. \u201cThat piddling-assed little car bomb that took out your agent looks like a firecracker compared to what I\u2019m capable of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off, Dawg,\u201d Natches warned him.</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone, Natches. I can handle it.\u201d She smiled back at Dawg tightly as his wife came up behind him, her eyes sparkling in anger as she glared at Chaya.</p><p>\u201c \u2018That piddling-assed car bomb,\u2019 as you call it,\u201d she bit out, \u201chad a signature. We\u2019ve tracked it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t leave fucking signatures,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cExactly. You don\u2019t. And that alone is your signature,\u201d she told him. \u201cDon\u2019t play dumb, Dawg, just because you don\u2019t like me.\u201d Chaya came to her feet, her hand gripping Natches\u2019s wrist. \u201cYou, Rowdy, Ray, your wives, and your closest friends were investigated first. Thoroughly. I headed that investigation. I know how thorough it was, because I knew none of you were evil. Snarky, damned mean when you need to be, and so damned arrogant you make a woman\u2019s back teeth clench. But you\u2019re not traitors, and you\u2019re not terrorists. And I proved it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s right.\u201d Alex spoke up, drawing their gazes. He was leaning back in his chair, his gray eyes lit with amusement. \u201cYou\u2019d make lousy terrorists, and you made lousy soldiers. I believe that\u2019s why the Marines let you all go so easy, because you don\u2019t follow orders worth shit.\u201d He leaned forward and smiled placidly. \u201cBut they think I do. And Chaya knows her stuff. She\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s been working this case. Now, if we\u2019re all through playing these little power games, maybe we can get back to work here and figure out who the hell Timothy is chasing. Just in case he hasn\u2019t figured it out himself.\u201d</p><p>Natches stared back at Dawg, furious, bordering enraged, but the rage wasn\u2019t directed at his cousin. It was building inside him, threatening to burn out of control, because of his own suspicions. No, his own certainties.</p><p>He let Chaya pull him back to the chair and ignored her worried looks as the work continued. Finally, she moved away from them as Alex filled them in on the Freedom\u2019s League and their ties. It was information she already knew in abundance. She knew it, because that damned organization had killed her daughter.</p><p>He watched as she moved to the living room, sitting outside the group of women. Finally, Maria drew her forward, her smile kind. Maria was the kindest damned woman Natches had ever known until his cousins began falling in love. They had chosen women with those same qualities.</p><p>Finally, Chaya and Crista were talking. Natches watched them, noticed Dawg watching them, and caught his cousin\u2019s eye. They were going to have to talk about this, and soon. He couldn\u2019t figure out Dawg\u2019s problem with Chaya, and he was beginning to not even care what the problem was. It was going to stop.</p><p>Finally, as the hour grew later, they stood and stretched, shook their heads and admitted they would have to wait on Timothy. Natches stayed silent, watchful.</p><p>Chaya was exhausted and he led her to bed, tucked her against him, and waited for her to go to sleep. While he thought. And all the thinking in the world wasn\u2019t helping him to make sense of the knowledge brewing in his gut, or the anger tormenting his mind.</p><p>Thinking was only making it worse.</p> <p>FIFTEEN</p><p>Natches left Chaya, exhausted, sleeping peacefully in the bed he\u2019d dreamed of her sleeping in.</p><p>When he\u2019d returned from Iraq, he had thrown the bed he\u2019d partied in for so many years right into the lake. He\u2019d come in at night, taken one look at it, and something inside him had shattered.</p><p>The man who had slept in that bed wasn\u2019t the same man who had returned to it. The man who had returned belonged to someone now and was no longer the man that bed represented.</p><p>Before he left, he\u2019d been the bastard everyone thought he was and had been on a fast track to self-destruction. It was why he joined sniper training; it was why he worked without a spotter; it was why he had become one of their most proficient killers. Because life didn\u2019t matter to him\u2014not his, and not those he was sent to kill.</p><p>To the man he had been, happiness was something others felt. All he had felt then was the rage, the bitterness, the knowledge he was tainted by the blood of an incestuous, child-beating son of a bitch. And the fear that somehow, part of Dayle Mackay lived inside him. And then, he had seen true strength. He had seen a woman who should have been weeping in horror, in fear, and she had stood strong. She had lifted her chin defiantly and she had kept fighting.</p><p>And in those two weeks of recovery, she had let him hold her when she cried, when she learned the husband she thought she could trust had betrayed her and his country. He had teased her into laughter days later, and stolen a kiss. He had watched her eyes sparkle and his soul had claimed her.</p><p>And she had changed him. In that short time, she had erased the man he had been, and shown him the man he wanted to be. A man who was worthy of a woman that strong.</p><p>He stood on the deck now, leaning against the rail and staring into the dark water stretching out behind the boat, and realized that he had grown up long before his cousins had realized it. Maybe it had begun before Chaya, but he just knew it had cemented with Chaya.</p><p>He had bitched about the sharing that didn\u2019t continue after they came home, but only because to not bitch was to reveal too much. And he didn\u2019t want to explain Chaya. He didn\u2019t want to relive in words what he couldn\u2019t forget in his memories. And he couldn\u2019t betray Chaya by taking another woman.</p><p>He\u2019d let others think he had. Hell, he even watched Dawg take a few, but he hadn\u2019t been tempted to join in. He hadn\u2019t wanted to be tempted to join in. Chaya had been so firmly entrenched in his head and in his heart, that no other woman came close to the memory of her.</p><p>She loved him silently, as though she was afraid that to love him any other way would break her.</p><p>And his heart broke. As wild, as vicious, as his life had been at one time, it was nothing compared to the loss Chaya had suffered in the space of a few seconds. The death of her child, the knowledge that the father of that child had betrayed them both.</p><p>He breathed out heavily, tightening as he felt the boat rock, felt a presence behind him.</p><p>He knew who it was. He knew Dawg wouldn\u2019t be asleep any more than he was tonight. Not with the events that were beginning to reveal themselves and the knowledge of the danger surrounding all of them.</p><p>He stood still, staring out into the water until a longneck beer was thrust in front of his face. His lips quirked as he took the bottle and glanced at the man who leaned against the rail beside him.</p><p>Dawg. They nicknamed him that for a reason. He never let things go. He chewed and chewed on a problem, worried it and fought with it until that problem either evaporated or bowed before him. He was as stubborn as the damned wind.</p><p>Natches took a long drink of the beer and waited.</p><p>\u201cYou changed,\u201d Dawg finally said quietly. \u201cOthers didn\u2019t see it like I did when you came home. You played a good game of pretending you were fucking the girls, of being as wild and woolly as you always were, but you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Natches stared at the bottle as he shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally admitted. \u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had no intention of sharing Kelly with Rowdy even if it had been what he wanted, did you?\u201d Dawg grunted. Rowdy would have killed both of them if they had touched Kelly.</p><p>\u201cNeither did you unless Rowdy really still needed it.\u201d Natches brought the beer to his lips thoughtfully. \u201cYour game was just as good.\u201d</p><p>Dawg sighed, the sound rough, worried. \u201cI don\u2019t have a daddy complex,\u201d he finally growled. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve got is a complex against games. Cranston\u2019s games and Agent Dane\u2019s, especially after what I learned tonight. She almost destroyed you once . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lost her daughter in a missile attack against enemy headquarters in Iraq five years ago. That was the false order initiated by the League. I suspect to keep their own activities secret. Beth was three. Her father was military intelligence and slipped her into the country after he deserted to the other side.\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the void as Natches held the beer loosely between his palms. \u201cIt was two weeks after I rescued her from the terrorists who had taken her while she was on assignment. Terrorists her husband betrayed her to. Nassar Mallah raped her with a baton, Dawg. He beat her face until her eyes were swollen shut. He kicked her and beat her until I wondered how she was still standing when I broke into that fucking dirt cell. But there she was. She\u2019d torn the clothes off the guard after I took his head off; barefoot and in shock, she was ready to run.\u201d</p><p>Dawg breathed out a vicious curse. A sound rife with the horror Natches described, the images blooming between them, steeped in blood.</p><p>\u201cWe hid in a hole I\u2019d made, and I activated the beeper for extraction. My team was waiting not far out, and I knew it, but too far to wait on them to rescue her. I bandaged her feet there, I covered her eyes, and in that dark little hole, I gave her my soul.\u201d He lifted the beer to his lips and finished it before turning to stare at the cousin that was more a brother, who was almost a father to him. \u201cCut her again, and we\u2019re finished. As friends, as family. Do you hear me, Dawg? That woman owns me, and she always will. You cut her again, and we\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>Dawg stared at Natches. Between them a lifetime of memories and trials, tears and brawling male adventures stretched. He\u2019d have sworn years ago that nothing could come between him and his cousins. But as he stared at Natches, the youngest of the cousins and the one most scarred inside, he saw something he\u2019d never imagined he\u2019d see.</p><p>He was used to seeing Natches as the battered kid he was always helping to rescue from Dayle Mackay\u2019s brutal fists. Then as the wild, too charming, troublemaking hellion he grew up to be. Then they went into the Marines.</p><p>And he guessed they really had grown up. Except Dawg hadn\u2019t wanted to see it in Natches. He hadn\u2019t wanted to see the horrors his cousin had survived when they were separated. And now, he saw it. But he saw something more. There was a core of pure hard steel inside him. That steel had pulled the trigger and killed another cousin to save Dawg\u2019s heart. That steel faced him now, and damned if Dawg would have blamed him if Natches had already decided to cut him out of his life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Natches had given him and Rowdy a loyalty that, Dawg didn\u2019t realize until this moment, he hadn\u2019t given his cousin in return.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He sighed, wiping a hand over his face. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to cut her, Natches. Son of a bitch, if I didn\u2019t want to hate her though. And I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>Natches continued to stare out on the water, and it broke Dawg up inside, seeing the pain on his cousin\u2019s face. Hell, he\u2019d have killed anyone else if they so much as thought to cut that little agent as he had. The Mackay cousins stuck together, it was that simple.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d have never let anyone else do it,\u201d he admitted, and it wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cWe might fuss a little between us, Natches, but you know that.\u201d</p><p>Natches nodded then. \u201cIt\u2019s the only reason we\u2019re talking now, Dawg. It\u2019s the only reason my fist hasn\u2019t gone down your throat and my boat is still here. Because I know that.\u201d</p><p>Dawg almost felt a spurt of fear. How had he let his enmity, his fear for his cousin almost bring them to that point? Fucking dumb redneck, he thought to himself. That was how. Sometimes, he was still the dumb redneck he had been when he was young.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not plain,\u201d he finally grated out. \u201cBut she\u2019s tough. And whatever she\u2019s dragging you into scares the shit out of me because you\u2019re not sharing it with us. And I know you, Natches. I know you know what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re protecting her from us when you don\u2019t need to and risking yourself. And that\u2019s what\u2019s pissing me off about her.\u201d</p><p>He watched as Natches lowered his head, his gaze slipping to his cousin\u2019s bare back, and he still flinched. After all these years, so many years, as the moonlight washed over the scars on Natches\u2019s tough, sun-bronzed flesh, fury still spiked through him.</p> <p>Natches\u2019s father had done that. That mean fucking bastard had lashed Natches until he nearly killed him. He\u2019d broken his rib, got him down, and then beat the living hell out of him. When Dawg, Rowdy, and Ray had burst into the house, Natches had been curled in on himself, nearly unconscious, his back in ribbons, and Dayle still laying the fucking lash to him.</p><p>And Dawg had sworn that night, sworn to God, it would never happen again. That no one, fucking no one, would scar Natches like that again, physically or mentally.</p><p>And still, something had had almost as profound an effect on Natches as his father had. A woman\u2019s pain. A woman\u2019s scars.</p><p>In that second, he realized that was what pissed him off now. Once again, Natches wasn\u2019t watching his own back. He was more concerned with someone else\u2019s safety, someone Dawg didn\u2019t know and was too damned wary to trust.</p><p>\u201cNatches, stop looking at the fucking water, man. Tell me what the hell is going on. I watched you tonight going over those files. You put something together, and you\u2019re still trying to protect the rest of us. Let us help you. We didn\u2019t take that from you when we were in trouble. Don\u2019t do it to us now.\u201d</p><p>Whatever it was, Natches had figured it out slowly, because he hadn\u2019t hit the roof, he hadn\u2019t dug out his sniper rifle, and Dawg and Rowdy hadn\u2019t heard the rage. Natches was easier to figure out when he hit a hard, fast rage. The slow ones, those were damned scary. And Natches was in a slow-building rage.</p> <p>As he stared at Natches, the boat rocked again. Dawg looked up as Rowdy crossed the deck now. Their boats were close enough to jump from one to the other. Rowdy wasn\u2019t being cut out from this late-night conversation and Dawg could tell from Natches\u2019s grimace that he knew it, too.</p><p>\u201cBeer\u2019s in the cooler,\u201d Natches said softly, finishing the one Dawg had handed him. \u201cGet me another while you\u2019re at it.\u201d</p><p>He turned and lobbed the empty bottle into the trash can at the corner of the railing.</p><p>At least Dawg didn\u2019t have to look at those fucking scars anymore. The sight of them just pissed him off, even now, so many years later.</p><p>Rowdy got the beers and moved to them, his expression still as he handed them over.</p><p>\u201cYou two going to fight?\u201d he asked, and his gaze narrowed on them. \u201cI\u2019m not up to refereeing tonight, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>Dawg snorted. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve just been trying to convince knuckle-head here to tell me what the hell is going on with his woman and that damned Cranston. My neck is starting to itch damned bad. It\u2019s keeping me awake at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatches will tell us when he needs to.\u201d Rowdy shrugged, but Dawg heard the question in his voice as well.</p> <p>\u201cYour neck itches,\u201d Natches said then, his voice eerily quiet. \u201cHave you felt the sights between your eyes yet? Playing with you, targeting you, just waiting, because the time isn\u2019t right yet?\u201d</p><p>Dawg froze. His gaze slashed to Rowdy\u2019s and saw the same shock in his face that Dawg felt.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d Rowdy snarled.</p><p>Rowdy rarely cursed, Kelly just didn\u2019t like it, and he tried to clean his mouth up. For a Marine, that was some hard shit to do. And the fact that he was slipping told more of his fury than anything else could.</p><p>Natches lifted his head then and stared at the mountains around them. The grief they saw on his face then, the heavy, quiet sorrow had Dawg\u2019s guts cramping with dread. Because he knew. God help him, he was terrified he knew exactly what was getting ready to come out of his cousin\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dayle, isn\u2019t it, Natches? That\u2019s who Cranston is after; he\u2019s the one who was helping Johnny. That\u2019s why he\u2019s playing games with you, and with your agent.\u201d In a heartbeat, Dawg knew the truth.</p><p>Natches grimaced, a tight, mocking smile twisting his lips before he tilted the bottle to his lips and drank. In seconds the bottle was empty and crashing into the trash hard enough to rock the can as Dawg and Rowdy flinched.</p><p>Natches stared at the can, wishing he could free enough emotion where his father was concerned to just get mad. Just mad. Just enough to rage at the injustice of life that allowed something as rabid as Dayle Mackay to sire a child.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t. All he could feel was that cold, hard core of knowledge inside him. The same one he had felt when he realized Johnny Grace was as dangerous as a rattler coiled to strike. His fingers itched to caress his rifle, to take out the threat, to make certain, damned certain the bastard couldn\u2019t strike at Chaya, Rowdy, or Dawg. Or, God forbid, Ray.</p><p>Dayle couldn\u2019t touch his sister, Janey, at least. She was away at college, far, far away; Natches had made damned certain of it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been playing with me,\u201d Natches commented. \u201cNot right now, but often enough. He must have been busy this month, I haven\u2019t felt his gunsights in a while. But right after I terminated Johnny, I felt them. I felt them hard enough that I wondered if he\u2019d finally made his mind up to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t say anything?\u201d Rowdy growled, furious. Natches could hear the anger in his tone.</p><p>Natches shrugged. \u201cI know how to give back. I let him feel me for a while.\u201d And it had amused him. Just as he knew it had amused Dayle when Natches felt those sights between his eyes. Once a sniper always a sniper, but once an assassin, a man always knew when it was turning back on him. Dayle amused Natches for the most part with his games. He didn\u2019t know how to target, didn\u2019t know any more than an experienced hunter knew. The wind positioning was never exact. He was always too far off. But he liked to pretend he could kill his son. The mess cook turned gourmet cook who thought he was a general in a revolution. It was so fucking laughable Natches still had trouble believing it.</p><p>Dayle Mackay had the temperament for what he was doing though. He\u2019d learned enough in the Marines to know how to be hard. He\u2019d made connections, and he\u2019d kept those connections. And Natches had known, as he\u2019d read those reports, as he had begun to put the pieces together along with the mental snapshots of the past few events that had tied in. Natches had known.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known who Agent Dane is chasing, Natches?\u201d Dawg asked.</p><p>Natches could feel his anger, too. Protective, that was Dawg. And he knew Dawg would never forget the night Natches hadn\u2019t been able to protect himself. The night he had nearly let his father beat him to death, to protect his sister. And he would have done it again. If Ray hadn\u2019t found a way to make certain Dayle was too scared to leave so much as a bruise on Janey, Natches would have let his father kill him to protect her.</p><p>Because no one in the damned county had the balls to stop it. They were terrified of Dayle Mackay. Bullying, cold, mean to the fucking bone. And a fucking gourmet chef on top of it. It was almost enough to leave a man rolling in laughter at the thought of it. Dayle Mackay could make a meal that would leave a man crying in joy at the taste. And he could beat a man to a bloody pulp with the same cold precision.</p><p>\u201cI knew before she arrived.\u201d Natches finally shrugged. He hadn\u2019t wanted to admit it to himself. He\u2019d refused to even consider the suspicion. But he had known. The day Johnny had died Natches had stared into his father\u2019s eyes across the town square and Dayle had known who had killed Johnny. And Natches had known, in that one instant, who had helped Johnny. Hell, helped him nothing. Johnny hadn\u2019t masterminded that little deal, Dayle Mackay had. And now Natches had to deal with it.</p><p>\u201cCranston has Chaya playing a smoke game, and I know it. Not enough to cause Dayle to target her, but enough, he\u2019s hoping, to make Dayle mess up just enough to rain down the wrath of Timothy Cranston on him. The wrong phone call. The wrong meeting with the wrong person. Just enough to pull him in on suspicion of terrorist activities.\u201d</p><p>Silence surrounded them. Natches didn\u2019t feel the chill of the night on his skin, he felt the chill of betrayal in his gut. And of fear. Because the one thing he hadn\u2019t considered until tonight, until that bomb had taken the other agent out, he hadn\u2019t considered the risk to Chaya.</p><p>Dayle had no problem whatsoever targeting her. Killing her would kill Natches, and figuring that out wouldn\u2019t take rocket science, especially not after the past few days.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m moving the boat tomorrow,\u201d he told them then. \u201cI\u2019m going to dock her behind the garage for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you are.\u201d Rowdy faced him, cold, hard. \u201cWe stick together, Natches. He\u2019ll expect you to separate yourself from us. We don\u2019t separate.\u201d</p><p>Natches shook his head. \u201cKelly and Crista . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre just as fucking innocent in this as that woman you have in your bedroom now,\u201d Dawg snarled. \u201cI might not like the situation, damn it, but I\u2019ll be damned if you\u2019ll pull away from us like that. There\u2019s safety in numbers, man. And right now, Dayle isn\u2019t going to take that risk here. We\u2019d all know who did it. We know his style and his signature, he can\u2019t take that risk. You make yourself a target, and he can take you out easy.\u201d</p><p>Natches scratched at his cheek and gazed out into the night. That was the only insurance Natches had ever had against his father\u2019s wrath. He\u2019d rubbed Dayle\u2019s nose in it, too. He couldn\u2019t take Natches out without the whole damned town knowing it. And a part of Natches had never really believed his father would try to kill him, until recently.</p><p>Hell, he should just pack himself and Chaya up and leave. Making a life somewhere else wouldn\u2019t be that damned hard. Except there was no way in hell she would go for it. She was an agent, and she didn\u2019t break her word, she wouldn\u2019t betray DHS that way. She would resign, and that was a given once this assignment was finished, if they survived it.</p><p>\u201cHave you discussed any of this with Chaya yet?\u201d Rowdy asked.</p><p>Natches shook his head. He had only let himself believe it tonight. \u201cShe\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>She was curled in his bed, safe and warm for the moment, where he needed her to be always. Safe and warm, and sheltering his child under her heart.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant.\u201d He let the words slip past his lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He knew she was pregnant. He could feel it clear to his soul. The moment she told him she wasn\u2019t protected, that knowledge had slammed clear to his gut.</p><p>Silence again. Rowdy\u2019s eyes widened and Dawg\u2019s seemed to bug out.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s what?\u201d Dawg wheezed. \u201cWhat the hell? She\u2019s not been back here long enough, unless . . .\u201d He let it trail off.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d His child. Boy or girl, it didn\u2019t matter, it wouldn\u2019t matter. \u201cShe won\u2019t admit it, but I know she is, Dawg. The first time, she wasn\u2019t protected and I didn\u2019t give a damn.\u201d But now, fear sliced inside him. His baby rested inside her, barely more than an instinct, and already that child was in danger. \u201cI haven\u2019t given a damn since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Rowdy breathed out roughly. \u201cOkay, another reason why you don\u2019t go running off solo. Your ass is staying here. And so is hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re risking your lives,\u201d Natches told them both. \u201cKelly and Crista need you two. This is my fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants me to kick his ass,\u201d Dawg snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo, he wants a cold bath tonight, and I might oblige him by tipping his ass over that rail and into the lake,\u201d Rowdy said with a healthy dose of disgust. \u201cGet over yourself, Natches. Later today, we tackle Cranston. That little bastard has gone too far this time. He should have contacted us to start with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>Dawg and Rowdy stared back at him in surprise. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe anonymous call the night Chaya came into town. I finally recognized the voice despite his attempts to disguise it. It was Cranston. That was his warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he needs to brush up on his social-fucking-skills.\u201d Dawg\u2019s smile was one of those nerve-racking curves that always denoted trouble. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll just enlighten him on that little tidbit when we get hold of him.\u201d</p><p>Natches stared at Rowdy, then at Dawg, and shook his head. He hadn\u2019t wanted them involved, but hadn\u2019t they always been? Dayle would never be satisfied if he managed to take Natches out, because he hated his nephews with the same consuming fury that he hated his son. And his brother Ray? His hatred for Ray ran so strong and so deep that Natches had worried for years that Dayle would strike back at him.</p><p>\u201cWe meet back here in the morning, then tomorrow night,\u201d Rowdy told them both as he moved to the rail of the boat. \u201cWe hash this out then and figure things out. And we do this together.\u201d He stared back at Natches, his gaze hard, determined.</p> <p>Natches nodded. There wasn\u2019t a chance they would let him do it alone, he knew.</p><p>He watched as his cousins, his family, jumped from his boat to Dawg\u2019s. Dawg headed inside while Rowdy made the jump to his own houseboat, his shadow barely visible even under the clear sky and nearly full moon.</p><p>He stared up at that moon, and before he headed back inside to Chaya, he whispered another prayer. This one for protection. God, don\u2019t let him lose Chaya, because he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that he would never survive it.</p><p>Chaya smiled as she felt Natches move silently beside her in the big bed, then gave a little shiver as his cool body curled around her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold,\u201d she murmured, not quite awake, not quite asleep, but content to drift where she was, content and peaceful.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna get me warm.\u201d His voice washed through her, just a little rough, tinged with masculine amusement.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She shifted against him, her legs rubbing against his hair-roughened ones as a sense of completeness began to make itself known.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t feel comfortable. She shouldn\u2019t feel like she was home in his arms, because she hadn\u2019t known what home felt like until Natches.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really cold,\u201d he murmured, rolling her to her back as her lashes lifted and she stared into his shadowed face, glimpsed his quick smile.</p><p>She loved his smile, though she hadn\u2019t seen it nearly enough since coming to Somerset. She wanted to see it every second of her day, she realized. A smile on his lips and in his eyes.</p><p>She let her hands slide up the arms braced on each side of her body, until they curved around his neck. She was ready for his kiss when it came, and he had no right to claim being cold, he was an inferno, heated and hungry.</p><p>His kiss sank into her, his lips slanting across hers as he moved over her, sliding between her thighs and nestling the head of his erection against the slick folds of her sex.</p><p>\u201cYou feel warm now, Natches,\u201d she whispered, feeling the need beginning to grow inside her again.</p><p>As he slid inside her, thick and hard, her breath caught in her throat and her back arched, taking more of him, taking him deeper and fighting to hold him tighter. Though she was stretched so tight around him that a thought couldn\u2019t have slid between his flesh and hers.</p><p>\u201cDownright hot now.\u201d His breathing was rough, his hands demanding, gentle, as he stroked her body, his head bending until his lips and tongue could play over her nipple.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you feel kinda hot,\u201d she gasped, then moaned as he suckled her deep and thrust heavily inside her. \u201cOh God, Natches, what are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>But she knew what he was doing to her. Binding her so tight to him that there was no way to escape, no way to protect herself.</p><p>\u201cLoving you,\u201d he murmured against her nipple before kissing it softly and turning to the other tight peak. \u201cCan\u2019t you feel me loving you, Chay?\u201d</p><p>She could. Thrusting, sliding so deep and warm inside her, like a dream. He was taking her like a slow, lazy dream, making every stroke memorable, every touch burning inside her heart.</p><p>\u201cKeep loving me.\u201d She almost sobbed the plea, and she bit his shoulder as he raked his teeth over her nipple, sending sensation after sensation shooting clear to her womb. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, Natches. Don\u2019t stop loving me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot gonna happen,\u201d he groaned. \u201cAlways love you.\u201d</p><p>And she had known it, just as she had known she felt the same. She mouthed the words against his arm, felt him nip the curve of her breast, and the pleasure began to spiral. His thrusts became harder, deeper. They stroked, penetrated, and filled her with ecstasy as she flew in his arms.</p><p>Her hips lifted, her legs wrapping around his hips as she held on for the ride of her life. Each time with Natches was better than the last. Each touch, each kiss, each heated thrust inside her body bound her more tightly to him. And when she exploded, felt him explode and felt their release mingling, she knew his intentions of binding her even closer would only give them more to share. There was no way of binding her closer; he already was her soul.</p><p>Each spurt of silky release flowing into her had her crying out though. Her name on his lips, his name sobbing from hers as he finally collapsed against her and rolled to his side.</p><p>He still held her. He didn\u2019t let her go, just tucked her closer to him and let their breaths ease as drowsiness stole over her again.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d She whispered the words to herself.</p><p>Or so she thought. Natches felt his heart expand, nearly tearing from his chest at the sleepy, almost unconscious words.</p><p>I love you. Such a simple statement. Yet, those three little words embedded inside him and filled him with determination. He wasn\u2019t going to lose her. He\u2019d kill again first, and just as with Johnny, he would never regret it.</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>Timothy Cranston, a.k.a. the rabid leprechaun of DHS, strode into Natches\u2019s houseboat as though he owned it. He was followed by the other five agents assigned to the Somerset case, and they looked harried, sleepless, and concerned.</p><p>Behind them strode Sheriff Mayes, and he looked ready to explode with fury. His golden brown eyes were sizzling with anger and his tall, hard body was tense with the effort at maintaining self-control.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Chaya stood from her seat at the table, her eyes going from Timothy to the sheriff.</p><p>\u201cSomeone tried to kill Rogue Walker last night.\u201d Zeke\u2019s voice grated with fury. \u201cAnd they almost succeeded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d Chaya turned away, scrambling through the files laid out in front of her, looking for information. \u201cRogue didn\u2019t know anything. She would have told me if she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she just didn\u2019t know she knew anything,\u201d Natches suggested as he propped himself against the edge of the table and sipped at the coffee cup he held.</p><p>His green eyes were like flints of ice as he watched Timothy. \u201cIsn\u2019t that how it usually works, Timothy? It\u2019s what a person isn\u2019t aware they know that always trips them up. Or what someone suspects they know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogue knew something,\u201d Timothy growled. \u201cShe rides with that damned group of troublemakers on a regular basis. Several of them were tied to Grace and Bedsford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy association only.\u201d Natches shrugged, but Chaya caught the calculated drawl in his voice. \u201cHell, arrest the whole town and pull them into interrogation. Everyone but everyone associates eventually here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis little town of yours isn\u2019t as closed off as you want to think it is, Natches,\u201d Timothy snapped. \u201cThe tourism rate is incredible. Lake Cumberland is one of the greatest draws in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now we\u2019re looking for tourists?\u201d Natches lifted his brow and Chaya almost winced.</p><p>He\u2019d been cool and focused all morning, going through the files, making notes, answering her with short, brief replies.</p><p>\u201cI hate Mackays.\u201d Timothy sighed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, especially when they\u2019re self-proclaimed generals of a homegrown militant group.\u201d Natches grinned tightly, then reached behind him for the files he had stacked there, and threw them to the table. \u201cTry those boys and see if you come up with more than I did.\u201d</p><p>Chaya stared at him in shock.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying, Natches?\u201d Timothy stilled, the agents around him adjusting their posture, their hands in close proximity to their weapons.</p><p>Natches laughed at the moves as Sheriff Mayes angled himself to cover Natches if needed. Interesting. A man Chaya would have sworn didn\u2019t uphold loyalty over the law, yet he was silently aligning himself with Natches.</p><p>\u201cStop baiting him, Natches.\u201d She turned back to him, narrowing her eyes at the gleam of anger in his gaze. \u201cWe want to keep Timothy calm, remember? I\u2019m certain his secretary wasn\u2019t able to slip his meds in his coffee this morning, so let\u2019s not tease him.\u201d</p><p>It was a running joke that his secretary needed to dose his coffee with sedatives. He was so hyper sometimes he drove the rest of them crazy.</p><p>\u201cLook at the last file.\u201d Natches shrugged as he finished his coffee and set the cup aside. \u201cYou\u2019ll see what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Chaya hadn\u2019t seen the files. Natches had been up working before she awoke, and he had stayed distant, refusing to discuss whatever he was working on.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dealing with clumsy, drugged out hometown boys here,\u201d Natches informed them as Timothy pulled out that bottom file.</p><p>Chaya barely managed to stifle her gasp.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with men who have had a dream all their lives,\u201d Natches stated mockingly. \u201cInstead of sending Chaya in and risking her neck on this fool\u2019s errand you gave her, you should have come to someone who would know.\u201d</p><p>Dayle Mackay. There were three pictures on the front of the file. Dayle Mackay, Chandler Mackay, and another man who Chaya knew was suspected to be part of Freedom\u2019s League. These were obviously the men they had needed to target.</p><p>\u201cChandler wasn\u2019t in the military,\u201d she said, her voice low, shocked.</p><p>\u201cNope, Chandler liked to play war games though. His pansy ass was too important to risk, big-shot architect that he was. But he liked to show his kid how tough and strong he was, usually with his fists, though his wife did have a measure of control over him.</p><p>\u201cNow, good ole Dayle Mackay, there\u2019s another story.\u201d</p><p>Natches had once thought he had pushed that part of his past behind him, that he had conquered that hatred, that bitterness. Maybe he hadn\u2019t fully managed it, he thought as he watched Cranston read the file. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDayle didn\u2019t care who he beat up on, or how bad. And he kept his wife sedated enough that she didn\u2019t really give a shit either. He married money, confiscated the money on her parents\u2019 deaths, and let her live to watch all his glory plans move right along. General Dayle Mackay. That\u2019s what he calls himself in private. But then, he always has, so it wasn\u2019t easy to put it together at first.\u201d</p><p>He moved aside as Chaya shifted closer to him. Hell, he\u2019d thought he could have a life with her, and now that was being tested in the worst possible way. The son of a traitor? She had been married to one traitor already; he was pretty sure she wouldn\u2019t want another in the family.</p><p>\u201cThe other files, those are the men I remember from years back who made late-night visits, sat and drank his fine wine and talked about the golden future they could create.\u201d</p> <p>He had been a kid then. Those memories were always rife with pain. Natches had been a nosy kid, and sometimes he had been caught being nosy. And he\u2019d paid for it.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all right here together,\u201d Timothy exclaimed as he pulled free one of the few pictures Natches had stolen out of the house before his father had disowned him.</p><p>\u201cThat picture was stolen by accident.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI used to steal family pictures, not that we had a lot. His wife, Linda, she tried taking them for a few years, but finally gave up. She liked being sedated better.\u201d</p><p>Natches looked at the picture. Six men. Dayle, Chandler, and the men he remembered visiting when he was younger. And one woman. Nadine Mackay Grace between the two Mackay brothers, their arms around her as they grinned for the camera.</p><p>His mother, Linda, wasn\u2019t in the picture. Just those hard-eyed men and the sister the Mackay brothers had used for their own pleasure.</p> <p>Natches moved back to the coffeepot, feeling the need to slip away, to hunt. His rifle was clean and ready, ammunition prepared, his knapsack was packed. He could leave at a moment\u2019s notice and no one would have a clue where he was going. Or that the need to kill the man who sired him was eating him alive.</p><p>\u201cDelbert Grant is your explosives expert,\u201d he told them. \u201cHe was in town a few weeks ago. He\u2019s been out of the service a hell of a long time. But his son was with him; I guess every man needs an apprentice.\u201d</p><p>Natches almost snorted at the thought.</p><p>\u201cHow do we get the evidence we need against them?\u201d Timothy mused as he turned to his agents, and Chaya moved to Natches.</p><p>He tried to pull away from her again, to ignore her gaze.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Please.\u201d She stared up at him, then laid her head against his chest and he wondered if his heart was going to shatter in that moment.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t stop himself from touching her, from letting his hands flatten against her back and feel her melting against him.</p><p>But he stared over her head and watched as the agents went through the files, comparing names, associations, and placing each one at specific points of operation.</p><p>They weren\u2019t incredibly wealthy men. They were plotters, planners. They were bullies and self-appointed saviors. They were the worst kind of enemy.</p><p>\u201cThis one has a boat on the lake.\u201d The sheriff tapped the file of one of the more well-to-do members of the group. \u201cHe has a group out here several times a year. They don\u2019t cause trouble, but they give you a clear feeling of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Ray wouldn\u2019t let them dock here,\u201d Natches told them.</p><p>Timothy\u2019s head raised at the mention of Ray\u2019s name. \u201cWhere are your cousins? And Jansen? They\u2019re not around this morning.\u201d</p><p>He stroked Chaya\u2019s back as she turned in his embrace to watch Timothy. She was still relaxed against him, conforming to his harder, larger body, as though her petite frame could cushion him against any of this.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re around,\u201d he said softly.</p> <p>Chaya tensed at the sound of his voice. Soft, almost gentle. A lazy drawl that held no warmth, no comfort.</p><p>Chaya watched as Timothy narrowed his eyes on them, taking in their position, the way Natches held her against him. It was an unmistakable picture and the special agent\u2019s gaze flickered with knowledge.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what you wanted, wasn\u2019t it, Timothy?\u201d Natches asked, and Chaya forced herself to remain silent, to keep her eyes on Timothy. \u201cYou sent her in here stirring the pot so you could draw us out and make us do your work for you.\u201d</p><p>Timothy exhaled roughly, ran his hand over his balding head, and gave Natches a wary grin.</p><p>\u201cI knew if anyone could do it, you boys could.\u201d He finally shrugged. \u201cI was getting nowhere. All we had was the Somerset connection and Johnny\u2019s connection to your dad and your uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Natches snapped. \u201cNever title those two with those names again. You call them by name; you don\u2019t relate them to me.\u201d</p><p>Cold bitter rage cut through his voice then, and Chaya felt her heart breaking. She had to blink back her tears, and watched as Timothy lowered his head and ran his hand over his face before nodding sharply.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d The agent sighed. \u201cThey don\u2019t deserve it. You\u2019re a fine man, Natches, you and your true uncle and those cousins of yours. You\u2019re damned good people. I\u2019m not fighting you for that. Nor am I going to argue over the stench the other two have cast on the rest of you. But we have to deal with this now.\u201d His fingers flicked to the files Natches had produced in the early hours of the morning. \u201cWe can\u2019t arrest them without proof.\u201d He looked at Chaya. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have anyone tying them close enough to Johnny Grace yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will have,\u201d Natches stated. \u201cWhen you\u2019re fishing for the big bass, Cranston, you just have to have the right bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s the right bait?\u201d Cranston asked him warily.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Chaya felt her heart nearly stop in her chest as fear began to drive a spike through her soul. She twisted around, ignoring his attempt to hold her in place, and stared into the hard, savage expression that had settled over Natches\u2019s face.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the man she knew. The man who teased or laughed or even the man she had known to be angry. This wasn\u2019t anger, it wasn\u2019t even rage. It was pure icy terror packed into six feet two inches of tight, hard Marine assassin. This was the man who had killed Johnny Grace the year before, the man who left Timothy Cranston sweating in fear for months after that operation. And seeing the icy, frozen core of that man sent a tremor of wariness through her.</p><p>And he knew it. His gaze licked over her, icicles and cold fire, causing a shiver to race down her spine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the wrong bait.\u201d Chaya had to force the words past her throat. \u201cHe knows we\u2019re together; he knows I\u2019m an agent. He won\u2019t go for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure he will,\u201d Natches drawled, and God she hated that sound. There was nothing warm or comforting in it.</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d she bit out, pulling farther away from him to stare back at him angrily. \u201cHe\u2019ll know it\u2019s a trick. A trap. He\u2019ll never mess up like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep looking in those files,\u201d he told her then. \u201cCheck out Fletcher Linkins. We were in sniper training together.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze moved to the files and then back to him. \u201cGood ole Fletch is dead, did you know that?\u201d He directed the question to Timothy.</p><p>Timothy nodded. \u201cCar wreck while he was on leave about four years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t wreck his car,\u201d Natches snarled. \u201cHe was killed. I went looking for him after I returned home. I wanted to know why a fellow sniper took a bead on me and tried to take my head off. He was already dead when I found him. Because he had failed the mission the Freedom\u2019s League gave him to kill me. Check his link to good ole Dayle.\u201d</p><p>Timothy shook his head. \u201cWhy target you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was helping Chay in Iraq.\u201d Natches smiled tightly. \u201cI was investigating the orders that sent those missiles into that hotel and I was the one that took out Nassar for torturing her. They wanted me out of the way. They didn\u2019t want me tying the threads together, because then I would have known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t know what was going on in Iraq until Chaya came back this time,\u201d Timothy mused, nodding his head. \u201cIt makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDayle\u2019s involved in this up to his eyeballs. He\u2019s connected with the men in that photo, and those men are all connected in various ways to military intelligence and/or DHS. They\u2019re not wealthy, they\u2019re not powerful, but they\u2019re going to be. If they\u2019re not stopped.\u201d</p><p>Chaya wrapped her arms across her breasts and listened as Natches and Timothy discussed how to trap them. She watched Natches, and she knew he\u2019d already decided exactly what he was going to do. He was only going through the motions here, letting Timothy get his say in. He was patient, controlled, and Timothy had no clue that Natches was already formulating his own plans.</p><p>It was the reason why the other cousins weren\u2019t here. It was why Alex wasn\u2019t here. Because they were already working their end. He\u2019d already discussed it with them.</p><p>The knowledge of that had her jaw clenching as she stared at him, willing him to meet her eyes. When he did, she wanted to flinch. Because she could see beneath the ice, and she could finally see the pain building inside him.</p><p>Finally, Timothy and his agents were gone and Natches was locking the door behind them. He stood still as he set the security system, his gaze focused on the digital settings, glaring at them, trying to push back the need to destroy something.</p><p>He\u2019d mastered those uncontained rages years ago. The ones that left every stick of furniture around him in slivers. The ones that left his hands bloody from ramming them into the walls.</p><p>He breathed in deeply and caught Chaya\u2019s scent. A fresh, clean smell that almost, just almost, pushed past the putrid scent of betrayal in his mind. The smell of his own blood, his own pain.</p><p>\u201cYou lied to Timothy,\u201d she whispered then.</p><p>Natches turned back and watched her. Dressed in his T-shirt and another pair of borrowed leggings. He was going to have to remind Dawg to check on her luggage, see if she had any of her own clothes left.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you lie to him, Natches?\u201d Her voice was soft, and the sound of it tried to ease the ragged edges of his soul.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I lied?\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest and stared back at the woman who held his soul with such silken bonds that he knew he would never be free.</p><p>And he felt just as unworthy of those bonds now as he had in Iraq. Not that it was going to stop him from tying her to him, and better she learn what he was now, rather than later. But sometimes, in the darkest reaches of his soul, there were moments that he cringed at the thought that he was dirtying her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a trained interrogation specialist, lover. That\u2019s what I do. Remember?\u201d Her smile was just as hard and just as tight as his had been earlier. But that word on her lips. Lover. Hell, no one had ever called him \u201clover,\u201d even teasingly. It was such a simple word, and often used so carelessly. But it wasn\u2019t a word Natches had used, or had used for him. And it sank inside him, tried to warm him in all the places he had gone cold and hard. For years, he had existed on autopilot, a Marine, a man who knew he had no true home, no family other than the cousins and uncle who still yet belonged to others. Nothing was his alone.</p><p>Until Chaya. And here he stood trying to protect that one precious thing in his life, perhaps two, and he could tell she was going to fight him tooth and nail. Just as his cousins fought him.</p><p>He shook his head and moved into the room, staring around it, and realizing why he had moved from the houseboat to the garage apartment the year before. This wasn\u2019t a home. He hadn\u2019t wanted it to be a home.</p><p>\u201cNatches, you\u2019re not talking to me.\u201d His head jerked around at the slightest thread of fear in her voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stood across the room watching him, her arms wrapped across her breasts as she stared at him. And those pretty eyes, such a warm, sweet honey color, seemed to spill inside him.</p><p>\u201cHe was part of the reason your daughter was killed.\u201d He spoke the words slowly and watched her flinch, watched her and made her accept that betrayal. The group Dayle Mackay was a part of had found a way to authenticate a strike that had never been approved. The strike that had killed her child.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t.\u201d She swallowed tightly as he watched her battle her tears.</p> <p>He had only seen her cry once, and God help him, those tears followed him in his nightmares. Wrenching sobs tore from her soul as he held her safe beneath him, forced her head to his chest and watched that hotel explode.</p><p>And that night, the first time he had loved her, the night her daughter had died, he\u2019d had to tear his gaze away from her, turn his back on her and clench his fists to keep from going after Dayle Mackay then and there. Killing him would only solve a part of the problem. Just one part out of a dozen. But he wanted to kill.</p><p>Because he remembered her screaming sobs as he dragged her back to the small hotel where he stayed sometimes. There he had held her, rocked her, loved her, and he let silent tears fall from his own eyes.</p><p>\u201cHis blood is mine.\u201d He turned back to her and shook his head as he felt the chill inside him.</p><p>\u201cAnd your blood?\u201d she whispered as she moved to him, took his hand and placed it on her stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re blood is here, Natches.\u201d</p> <p>He caressed her stomach through the clothes; he couldn\u2019t help himself. Her heated flesh met his calloused hands, and as he did when he held her at night, he imagined he felt life there. Hope.</p><p>He shook his head and wanted to pull away from her, but he couldn\u2019t force himself to.</p><p>\u201cAnd when this is over, you may curse the night you allowed me to come inside you.\u201d He found the strength to pull back from her, to walk away.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch!\u201d He didn\u2019t get far before her fingers gripped his wrist and she jumped in front of him. \u201cExcuse me here? But are you daring to walk away from me?\u201d</p><p>He dragged his fingers through his hair, a frown jerking between his brows at the anger on her face, the accusation in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI have things to do, Chaya.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd of course you\u2019re not going to do the \u2018partner\u2019 thing you\u2019ve been preaching about here and tell me what the hell they are. Right, Natches?\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly. \u201cThat about sums it up.\u201d</p><p>She looked as though he had slapped her. Natches stared back at her in confusion as she backed away from him, her face paling.</p><p>\u201cSo much for all my courage and strength that you so highly respect,\u201d she sneered. \u201cI guess, once again, I\u2019m delegated back to the weak little woman who has to be protected. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my fight,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s your blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking A,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cWell, excuse me, Mr. Mackay, but there\u2019s a damned good chance I\u2019m carrying your blood inside me, so I think that makes it my damned fight as well.\u201d</p> <p>And how the hell was he supposed to counter that argument?</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way, Chay.\u201d He tried pure male dominance and decisiveness.</p><p>\u201cBecause you decree it?\u201d Her eyes were fiery now, not just in anger, but in confrontation, in determination.</p><p>Hell, he was getting hard. He could feel his arousal stretching to life, the ice that had encased his emotions beginning to melt as she glared back at him.</p><p>\u201cYou can decree to hell and back, Natches, and it\u2019s not going to do you one damned bit of good. You dragged me into this relationship, you\u2019re the one that made damned sure my soul was so tied to yours that I couldn\u2019t breathe without feeling you, and then you did everything in your power to help create life from it. Damn you, you\u2019re not backing away now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBacking away was never in the cards.\u201d He lowered his head and growled the words at her. \u201cDid I say you could leave this relationship?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and disbelief filled her face. And that made him grow harder, because the disbelief was filled with scornful amazement.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you take the cake.\u201d Her hands went on her hips, and his cock just got harder still. \u201cI can\u2019t believe your complete arrogance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should, you\u2019ve dealt with it before.\u201d He wasn\u2019t budging. If he told her what he had planned, then she would just stick her nose into it. Her nose was far enough on the chopping block; he wasn\u2019t going to allow it to go any farther.</p><p>\u201cYou are not doing this without me!\u201d The words were said with such snap that his brow lifted mockingly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not going after him with me.\u201d She\u2019d lost enough in her life; he wasn\u2019t going to allow her to lose any more. Not her life, or their child\u2019s. And he knew that child was there, resting securely within her. He intended to make damned sure he kept that child safe. The child and his or her mother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked this case for five years,\u201d she said furiously. \u201cFive years, so you could come in with your lies and your damned charm and force me out of it? \u2018Oh, Chay, I just admire your courage and strength,\u2019\u201d she sneered, her face twisting in fury. \u201cFuck you, Natches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t lie.\u201d His voice rose, unintentionally, fueled by the anger and the arousal rising inside him. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t admire it? That I\u2019d want to change a damned thing about you? I\u2019m not trying to change anything, damn you, but I will protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew your protection.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his fists, not in rage, but to keep from touching her, to keep from jerking her to him and taking all the wild passion, driving into it until they both forgot the pain and the danger moving in on them.</p><p>\u201cChay, don\u2019t push me on this,\u201d he growled back. Damn her, she was tearing him apart inside. He could see the betrayal in her eyes, the hurt, and he hated it. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fight you can be a part of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not a fight I\u2019ll let you push me out of,\u201d she yelled back.</p><p>Turning, he watched as she stalked to the table and snapped her laptop shut. She gathered the files, stuffed them with the laptop in her case, then jerked her boots from the floor and sat on the couch.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d He grabbed the boot from her hand and held it out of her reach as she came off the couch, fury stamped on her flushed features. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I\u2019m not.\u201d When she couldn\u2019t jerk the boot out of his grasp, she pulled the case on her shoulder and moved to the door barefoot.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go outside without shoes. It\u2019s cold out there.\u201d He parked himself in front of the door as she stood before him, breasts heaving, her little fists clenched at her side as though she were actually going to use them on him.</p><p>\u201cBetter the cold outside than the cold in here.\u201d She slapped his chest. \u201cNow get out of my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChay, you don\u2019t want to keep this up,\u201d he grated out. \u201cCalm the hell down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you tell me to calm down, Natches Mackay.\u201d A finger was in his face, pointing too close to his nose as he looked at it, then slowly looked up at her.</p><p>\u201cPut that finger down, Chay.\u201d There was something about that finger in his face that made every male instinct inside him stand up in outrage.</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d That finger jabbed into his chest. \u201cCome on, tough ass. Make me. You\u2019ve cheated everywhere else in this relationship, you might as well cheat here, too. What are you going to do? Tie me to the bed? Because damn you, that\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll keep me here.\u201d</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>There was something about that finger in his chest and the complete and total fury transforming Chaya\u2019s expression that did it to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u201d being completely wiping his mind of everything but possessing her. \u201cIt\u201d being imagining her on her knees, naked, nipples tight, hard, and red, while he fucked that sarcastic little mouth with shallow thrusts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u201d being owning her soul because she owned his. He knew, even as he stood there mad as hell and fighting it, that there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell he could keep her if he did this alone. And that just made him madder. Just made him hornier.</p><p>\u201cThat finger is getting ready to get you in trouble,\u201d he warned her softly.</p><p>Her lips flattened, then she did something he would have never imagined. Something that had his eyes widening in shock. She lifted that cute little hand and her middle finger shot up like a flag.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to say a word. Her expression said it all as she turned her back to him and began to move through the living room. Probably heading to the back deck door.</p><p>Oh, that was just too bad.</p><p>He jerked his boots off and let them thump to the floor as she reached the kitchen. And she kept going. His shirt came off as he moved after her, and he tossed it to the couch.</p><p>And she knew. She threw a look over her shoulder and almost managed to run a step or two. Before she made it past the table his arm hooked around her waist and he dragged her to the stairs.</p><p>And like the little hellion she was, she fought him. She kicked, she wiggled, she snarled, and he swore she bit his shoulder. But she wasn\u2019t fighting hard enough. All that heavy breathing wasn\u2019t just because she had her mad on. Hell no, she was as wet as he was hard, and he was betting his cock on that fact. Because that was the portion of his body that was going to fall off if he didn\u2019t get it inside that hot little body of hers. Fast.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember a time that he had been so enraged and so aroused at the same time. He could feel his muscles pumping with blood, his dick throbbing like an open wound, his balls tight with lust.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t getting by with a single bout of anything today. Double helping, he thought. He was going to have that wet, impudent little mouth, and he was going to have that slick, heated little pussy, and when he was finished . . . hell, when he was finished, he was going to figure out how to give her what she needed and keep her safe at the same time.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t have to tell her that yet. Hell no. She was spitting mad and clawing at his shoulders, cursing him even as he tossed her to the bed and stripped his jeans off.</p><p>Chaya tore off the shirt she wore, then the bra. She was certain the strap snapped at some point. As Natches stepped out of his jeans, she wiggled out of the leggings and panties and she was waiting on him.</p><p>His shoulders were scratched from her fury, and she was certain she would be reasonably sorry for that later, but right now, smug possessiveness curled her lips instead.</p><p>\u201cI marked you,\u201d she snarled at him as he stepped toward the bed.</p><p>He smiled. A slow, lust-worthy curl of his lips that had a fist punch of reaction jerking in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, baby, because I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll mark you, too, before the night\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>She crawled to the edge of the bed and licked her lips, staring up at him from beneath her lashes and waiting. Anticipating.</p><p>\u201cI thought of you every time I used that toy.\u201d She taunted him now and watched his eyes flare with wicked heat. \u201cI sucked it until I could take it to my throat, and thought of you. I heard your groans in my head and I moaned around it as I touched myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo your throat?\u201d His voice was a raspy, guttural growl.</p><p>\u201cTo my throat. And I moaned.\u201d She licked her lips as she lifted one hand from the bed and let it run down her body. \u201cAnd I touched myself.\u201d She touched herself now. Her fingers slid through the slick juices, circled her clit, and her lashes fluttered in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cDid you come?\u201d He was closer, coming closer, his hand circling the thick shaft as the engorged crest tightened and throbbed in hunger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A small bead of pearly pre-cum dampened the tiny slit, drew her attention and her hunger.</p><p>\u201cI came,\u201d she teased him. \u201cI came and I moaned, and it wasn\u2019t enough. Because it wasn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>And she had needed him. Needed him until parts of her had felt barren and lost.</p> <p>He came closer, the head of his cock almost within reach.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to take me to your throat, Chay,\u201d he warned her, his voice so rough, so deep it caused her knees to weaken, her heart to pound in her chest.</p><p>\u201cMake me, Natches.\u201d She smiled, then her breath caught as she raked her finger over her clit, and knew he was aware of the pleasure she was bringing herself.</p><p>One hand snaked out, catching her hair, tangling in it as he held her still. Her tongue swiped over the broad head and she moaned at the rich earthly taste of the liquid bead on her tongue. Passion infused with lust. A storm, heat and lightning. It filled her senses and drenched her fingers with her response.</p><p>Then his cock was filling her mouth. Thick and iron hard, the head throbbing violently as he pushed inside her. Chaya moaned and heard his answering growl as she did what she promised. She took him to her throat, her tongue rippling beneath the underside as she relished the taste of him.</p> <p>One hand gripped his shaft, stroking it fiercely, determined to rip his control from him the same as he had managed to rip hers. Damn her, she had never given anyone, man or woman, the finger. That was what he did to her. He made her crazy. He made her insane to have him, made her want to fight and love him.</p><p>And God help her, how she loved him.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d he snarled as she lifted her lashes and stared up at him, taking him as deep as she could as she touched herself, stroked herself. \u201cYour mouth is illegal, Chay.\u201d</p><p>She would have smiled, but she whimpered instead. Because she needed him, hungered for him. Because she wanted to taste his release, glory in it.</p><p>She sucked him harder, flicked her tongue over the head as he fucked into her mouth, and swallowed him deep.</p><p>\u201cHellion.\u201d He pushed the fingers of both hands into her hair, tightened and pulled, and she moaned again, knowing the sound was vibrating against his cock head and glorying in his response.</p> <p>\u201cSweet Chay.\u201d Sweat drenched his face, his shoulders. It ran down his neck in tiny rivulets and dampened the hair that fell over his face.</p><p>He looked like a pirate. He felt like a pirate, because he had stolen her heart and her soul and she didn\u2019t want them back. She just wanted his in return.</p><p>\u201cSweet.\u201d He groaned, his lashes lowering, a dark flush on his cheeks as his lips appeared heavier, fuller, more sensual. \u201cSweet Chay. Suck it, baby. Suck it deep.\u201d</p><p>She drew him deep, moaned, licked, and felt the warning throb of his impending release. His abdomen tightened, sweat rolled down it, and a second later his head tilted back, his jaw clenched, and her name tore from his throat as he exploded.</p><p>Hot, rich, a taste of salt and man and the storm rising and he was filling her mouth with it, making her drunk on him. She took each furious blast and whimpered in loss as he pulled free of her.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d He pulled her hand free of the pulsing flesh of her pussy a second before her own loss.</p><p>Her eyes snapped open. \u201cI was ready to come,\u201d she almost howled as he flipped her to her back.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know.\u201d His grin was pure wicked male. \u201cIf you want to come, baby, all you have to do is ask nicely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAsshole!\u201d She grabbed his hair as he moved between her thighs and pulled. Pulled until his lips were buried in the tormented flesh and her legs were wrapped around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOh God. Yes. Damn you, Natches.\u201d She arched, her shoulders grinding into the mattress as his tongue dove deep inside the clenching depths of her core.</p><p>And he licked. \u201cOh yes. I love it. Love it when you do that.\u201d Her head thrashed; her fingers dug into his hair.</p><p>He licked and lapped inside her like he was eating candy and loving every minute of it. She was dying. Right there in his arms, she was dying and she didn\u2019t know how to stop it. She didn\u2019t know how to handle the burn or the violence of her response to his touch.</p><p>She was twisting against him, mewling in need as his hand landed on her rear. The rough little caress only made her burn brighter.</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d She twisted. She arched. \u201cOh God, Natches. More.\u201d</p><p>He gave her more. More of the rough caresses, the heated little smacks over her butt, and more of those delicious licks inside her. Then outside her. Then around her clit. He sucked the little bud into his mouth, and she exploded into fragments.</p><p>She screamed his name, pulsed and shattered, and before she could catch her breath, he pushed her legs apart, rose above her, and buried his cock inside her.</p><p>Full length. One hard thrust. He pushed inside her with hungry demand, her name on his lips as he began to thrust hard and fast. Stroking and fucking inside her and sending her crashing into wave after wave of fiery release.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t stop. She was burning, drenched in both their perspiration when he pulled free of her, flipped her on her stomach, and lifted her rear.</p><p>And he was pushing inside her again.</p><p>\u201cTake all of me.\u201d He groaned, coming over her, his fingers lacing with hers as he held her beneath him. \u201cFeel me, Chay. Feel all of me and I know I belong to you.\u201d</p><p>Her head tipped back as his teeth scraped her neck and he surged inside her again. Again. He pounded inside her until she shattered, flew, until she swore her soul left her body and merged with his as she felt the violent, harsh pulses of his semen shooting inside her.</p><p>If she wasn\u2019t pregnant yet, she knew she was now. She could feel it, that bonding, a connection she had never believed she could feel with another human being. And yet, with Natches, he had given her no choice. He had stolen her heart. Made her a part of him, and now, the fight was over for it. That didn\u2019t mean he was getting his way though.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered as he collapsed over her, his head lying against her shoulder, his eyes opening to meet hers as she turned her head to stare back at him. \u201cWith my soul, Natches Mackay, I love you.\u201d</p><p>Natches sighed heavily as he forced himself to pull from her, grimacing in pleasure at the heated friction along his cock.</p><p>Lowering himself beside her, he pulled her into his arms and pressed his lips against the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cI love you until, sometimes, I wonder if I can breathe without you now,\u201d he told her then, staring into the sunlit expanse of the bedroom as he caressed her back with one hand.</p><p>She was still and silent against his chest, though he knew that indomitable will of hers was still firmly in place. She was the strongest person he had ever known in his life, and he wanted nothing more than to allow her to be weak.</p><p>And that was the redneck in him, he knew it was. The man who wanted to protect his woman against any and all threats. To be a partner until danger rolled around. But he had chosen a woman who refused to hide from danger.</p><p>That courage she possessed terrified him.</p><p>\u201cDayle Mackay is dangerous,\u201d he said softly, staring at the ceiling now, his brow creasing into a frown as he let the memories of his childhood wash over him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t do that often. The past was just that, it was the past. When he had met Chaya, seeing her courage and her will to laugh had somehow helped him to dull those memories, but nothing could eradicate them.</p><p>\u201cDayle wanted a carbon copy of himself in a son,\u201d he stated. \u201cA bully without a conscience, and one he could control. He didn\u2019t have much luck with me. I was a smart-mouthed little bastard eaten up with rage. I defied him every chance I had, and I gloried in it, even when he was taking his fists to me.\u201d</p><p>That had been his relationship with the man he refused to call father.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not facing him alone.\u201d Her voice was soft, sweet, it was tinged with emotion and struck a bolt of feeling inside him that had him closing his eyes against the strength of it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other way to face him, but alone.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s come down to here, Chay. Just me and Dayle. I\u2019ve avoided him, I\u2019ve put it off. Hell, I should have just killed the son of a bitch before I met you, like I wanted to. But Uncle Ray would have felt as though he failed to raise me right, and Rowdy and Dawg, well, they would have had something to say about it.\u201d</p><p>Not much. But they would have said something, Natches thought.</p><p>He should have felt an edge of sorrow, hell, he should have felt guilt over the fact that it would be that easy to kill a man. But Dayle Mackay wasn\u2019t a man\u2014he was a monster.</p><p>Yet, he still hadn\u2019t killed him, and Natches was never certain what stopped him from doing it. Maybe because until now, Dayle had never really done anything evil, even though Natches had known he was evil.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t going to kill him now. Not unless Dayle gave him no other choice.</p><p>\u201cYou can give me the silent treatment until hell freezes over.\u201d She lifted her head and stared him in the eye. \u201cBut you\u2019re not doing this alone.\u201d</p><p>He, Dawg, Rowdy, and Ray had come up with the plan while Chaya slept. Their voices quiet to keep from disturbing her, their minds made up.</p><p>Natches knew the one thing Dayle had always wanted from him. Loyalty. It came down to something that simple. From the time Natches had been small, Dayle had been enraged at his affection for Ray and the two cousins he hadn\u2019t even known until they started school together. They had been instantly drawn to each other. And Natches had begun slipping away from his own home and sneaking to Ray\u2019s.</p><p>He and Dawg had been fascinated by Ray Mackay\u2019s gentle if sometimes gruff demeanor.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re with me, he\u2019ll never talk,\u201d he told her, keeping his voice firm, keeping himself strong. \u201cYou\u2019re not a part of this, Chaya. There\u2019s no way to make you a part of this.\u201d</p><p>He watched her as she laid her head on his chest, her eyes glittering with tears. And Chaya didn\u2019t cry easily. She didn\u2019t use tears to get her way; she didn\u2019t pull any of the female tricks to force a man\u2019s agreement he had seen over the years from other women.</p><p>Kelly, love her heart, she shamelessly used tears whenever she felt Rowdy was being too stubborn. Shamelessly because she and Rowdy both knew what she was doing. It wasn\u2019t a game to her so much as a way to get past Rowdy\u2019s sometimes stubborn mind-set. She was sweet and innocent, and sometimes she didn\u2019t understand the evil that existed in the world. Though he knew she would argue that sentiment.</p><p>Crista was stronger, but still, she was so completely female that Natches could only grin at the battles Dawg fought with his wife. She led the big, tough Dawg around with a crook of her finger and managed to get past even his most stubborn decisions. Like running the lumber store himself. Taking responsibility for it. Dawg was turning into a real businessman, courtesy of one little stubborn female.</p><p>Chaya, Natches knew, would never be like Kelly and Crista. Not that there was anything wrong with either woman. It was just both of them saw the world as it existed around them; they didn\u2019t know the darkness that existed beneath it. And Dawg and Rowdy would kill anyone that tried to show it to them.</p><p>Chaya was different. She knew the evil. She had lived with it. She knew the darkness, because she had spent years navigating it. And she knew him. And because of that, she was going to be hell on his nerves and he knew it.</p><p>\u201cYou better find a way to make me a part of it,\u201d she stated. \u201cBecause you\u2019re not doing it alone.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to grin at the tone of her voice.</p><p>Turning her onto her back, he stared into her eyes and laid his palm on her lower stomach.</p><p>\u201cDo you know I swore all my life I\u2019d never allow a woman to have my child?\u201d His fingers caressed her belly where he knew their child lay.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use that against me, Natches. That\u2019s dirty.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not doing that, Chay; I\u2019m trying to make a point here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re point being that I\u2019m risking our child if I try to help you. What about you? If anything happens to you, who is going to help me raise our baby? Who\u2019s going to teach him how to be a man?\u201d Her eyes didn\u2019t glitter with tears now, they glittered with anger.</p><p>His lips quirked at the sight of that anger.</p><p>\u201cIf anything ever happens to me, you\u2019ll be taken care of,\u201d he told her. \u201cJust as Kelly or Crista would be taken care of if anything happened to Rowdy or Dawg. But that wasn\u2019t my point.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen get to your damned point so I can tell you how much of your time you\u2019ve wasted. I\u2019m keeping track of it by the way.\u201d</p><p>He had no doubt in his mind that she was.</p><p>\u201cMy point was, Chaya, until you, I never dreamed I\u2019d find a woman strong enough to make certain my child was protected. Even if it had to be protected against me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened then, and Natches forced himself to face the fear that had followed him most of his adult life.</p><p>\u201cThey say blood will always tell,\u201d he told her. \u201cDayle Mackay uses his fists at the slightest provocation. He\u2019s one of those men that should have been sterilized before he had a chance to breed. To make certain that kind of mean wasn\u2019t hereditary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d She jerked away from him then, her expression incredulous as she rolled from the bed and stared back at him furiously. \u201cYou just wasted a half hour of my time with that crap?\u201d She was almost snarling now. \u201cGet your ass out of the bed, get dressed, and tell me what the hell you have planned before I have to shoot you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re strong enough to stand up to me, Chay. But I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m strong enough to keep from murdering Dayle Mackay if you have to see the monster that sired me.\u201d</p><p>There, it was out. He said it. That was the end of the subject as far as he was concerned. He rolled from the bed himself and jerked his pants from the floor. When he straightened, he stared back at her, feeling that inner rage flashing through him.</p><p>\u201cCranston needs that son of a bitch alive,\u201d he told her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take away from your courage or your pride, Chaya, but this is my battle, and it\u2019s my fight. I won\u2019t have the control to keep from blowing his head off if he strikes out at you. And he will. Just to test me. Just to make sure he has what he wants, he would do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d she bit out. \u201cNatches, what could he want that would make him so stupid? He\u2019s worked with the League most of his life from what I understand. He\u2019s been damned good at what he\u2019s done. What could he want so much that would make him mess up to that extent?\u201d</p><p>Chaya was furious. She stood her ground in front of him, glaring back at him, enraged that he would try to protect her when he needed her.</p> <p>\u201cMy soul,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cWhat does any monster want, Chay, but your soul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatches . . .\u201d</p><p>His hand went over her mouth, and when she stared into his eyes, she saw something that almost terrified her. Something more frightening than the icy rage she had seen before, something more destructive than mere fury. She saw a feral determination, animalistic, almost uncontrolled as he stared into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf he so much as breathes violence in your direction, so much as curls a finger to touch you, he will die.\u201d Natches\u2019s lips curled back from strong, clenched teeth. \u201cIf he breathes the same air you\u2019re breathing, so much as dares to step in your direction, I won\u2019t bother to think, I won\u2019t bother to try to control my rage. Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed tightly, the anger draining away to be replaced by a sorrow so strong it nearly stole her breath as her hand lifted and she touched his face. \u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe created me,\u201d he stated coldly. \u201cNow, he\u2019s going to have deal with me. But if DHS wants him alive when we\u2019re finished, then you\u2019ll stay out of it. Otherwise, I\u2019m not making any promises.\u201d</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>With Cranston aware of what they were looking for, it didn\u2019t take long to get the files of the men in the photograph with Chandler and Dayle Mackay, or to find the connections that brought them together.</p> <p>They were in the same Marine Corps unit for nearly eight years. They had stayed in touch afterward. Hunting trips. Fishing trips. Covers for their own dreams of glory as they drew in more and more recruits after they left the service but stayed involved in various military groups.</p><p>They had no true power backing them, individually, but they had gained it as a group. Here and there. Drawing in like-minded soldiers, at first, discharged soldiers, and slowly working their way up until their recruits were coming in from active service.</p><p>They had them tied in together. They connected the dots through the day until Cranston was certain it was only a matter of time before they had those responsible for the strike order in Iraq that had killed Chaya\u2019s child. But to ensure their arrest and the complete disclosure of all their members, they needed something more to bring Dayle Mackay in.</p><p>Natches would get them more. And Chaya was terrified how he would manage that, and what it would do to his soul.</p><p>Letting go of the fight over his decision to meet with Dayle Mackay by himself wasn\u2019t easy for Chaya. But she\u2019d seen that the more she argued with him over it, the more determined he became.</p><p>Redneck pride and stubborn will. She\u2019d heard about it; she\u2019d just never seen it. Not that he was a whole lot different from any other man of his kind. It just rankled more perhaps because he was hers.</p><p>And that was the part that was driving her crazy. He had charmed her, seduced her, loved his way right into her soul, and now he was shutting her out.</p><p>She looked over at him from where she sat at the table. Stretched out on the couch, one arm behind his head as he supposedly watched television.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t watching that droning news report any more than she was. He was wired, tense, waiting. Whatever Dawg and Rowdy had done that day evidently wasn\u2019t going to have immediate results.</p><p>As she watched him, her cell phone beeped imperatively at her ear.</p><p>\u201cDane,\u201d she answered the call, watching as Natches tensed further.</p><p>\u201cYou want to tell me what the hell your boyfriend\u2019s cousins are up to?\u201d Cranston snarled in her ear. \u201cThey just had a rather heated, if amusing, argument in the parking lot of Mackay Lumber. It seems they\u2019ve had a bit of a falling out with their cousin over a fucking picture he found.\u201d</p><p>God, what were they doing?</p><p>She lifted her eyes as Natches sat up and turned to face her. His eyes narrowed as she stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she finally answered. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Dane, we don\u2019t need fuckups here,\u201d Cranston bit out. She could imagine him scowling, his face wrinkling like an irate bulldog\u2019s. \u201cFind out what the hell is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you expect me to do that how?\u201d she asked him, still watching Natches, fear building inside her. \u201cDo you have the details of the conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, something along the lines of wiping their hands of him forever because he destroyed evidence against someone. A picture. One that implicated someone they didn\u2019t name, but anyone with a brain could put it together.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips nervously as Natches rose slowly to his feet and walked toward her. Her teeth clenched as he slipped the wireless unit from her ear and brought it to his own.</p><p>\u201cChaya\u2019s rather busy right now, Timothy,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cTry again later.\u201d</p><p>He disconnected the call and tossed the unit to the table.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer it.\u201d He pointed his finger to the ringing phone, then turned and walked into the kitchen.</p><p>And Chaya had had enough. She stood to her feet, gathered the files she was working on, and pushed them into her case. Shutting her laptop down, she pushed it into the case as well and carried it to the door.</p><p>\u201cWalk out that door and I\u2019ll tie you to the bed.\u201d His voice never rose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of that threat now.\u201d She sat down on the chair and pulled her socks on her feet before pulling her boots to her.</p><p>He pulled a beer from the fridge, opened it, and moved back to the living room, where he sat down on the couch and watched her, his green eyes intent, his expression carved from stone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Crista or Kelly,\u201d she told him. \u201cI won\u2019t be pushed behind you and protected, nor play the helpless little woman. If that\u2019s what you think, then you should sit down and rethink your options. That one isn\u2019t working.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the first boot over her foot.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be calling sometime tomorrow,\u201d Natches stated. \u201cAlex will be contacting Cranston tonight. At present, this marina, as well as the lumber store, is under surveillance by three of the men in that photo.\u201d He pointed to the picture laid out on the table. \u201cIf you walk out of here, you compromise me, is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>She let the boot fall back to the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d she whispered, staring back at him as she felt her chest clench with dread. She remembered the year before, the operation that had very nearly ended with Crista Jansen\u2019s death because Dawg had played games with Johnny Grace. And now, Natches was setting himself up as a target.</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows the Nauti Boys always stick together. Nothing comes between them. Now something has; there\u2019s a division. Nadine glimpsed it that morning Dawg and I were arguing at the diner over you. Remember?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, remembering the morning she had threatened to tell Crista on Dawg.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve seen us arguing more than once here lately, over you and this investigation. That worked in our favor. Now it appears that Dawg and Rowdy are arguing between them because I destroyed a picture that implicates someone in the investigation. And Dawg\u2019s letting his opinion that \u2018blood will tell\u2019 be known.\u201d</p><p>Chaya shook her head slowly. \u201cWhat kind of blood? What does he mean, \u2018blood will tell\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning, Chaya, that evidently, when it comes right down to it, my loyalty is to the bastard that sired me rather than the family that raised me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve kept me in the dark about this for what reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoping I could keep you out of it?\u201d He arched his brow mockingly. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, because I\u2019ve decided there\u2019s no other choice. Have you considered how someone found out who your agents were and managed to plant highly professional explosives on their vehicles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCranston suspects a leak,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s been going over the files. So have I.\u201d</p><p>Natches shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no leak, sweetheart. You were all staying at the Suites. You met there, in one particular room for a meeting most every morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause dishonorably discharged Private Michael Wheeler works there. And he\u2019s very good friends with Dayle Mackay. Look at the files on the men who have joined the ranks of the League. Most are dishonorably discharged for abuse, ignoring the chain of command, sex crimes. Those who weren\u2019t in the military are malcontents with a bitch, nothing more. Except maybe dreams of glory. Once I determined who at the hotel could have gotten in a position to watch you, it was easy to figure out. That\u2019s where Cranston made his mistake. He was afraid blood would tell, so he sent you in so he could watch me, see which way things would swing before he pulled me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was afraid you would protect Dayle Mackay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as his agents were. Just as his agents no doubt discussed in that room after you left each morning. The room could have been bugged, individual rooms could have been bugged. Who knows? But Dayle found out what was going on, and he knew Cranston was onto him; otherwise they would have never struck out at the agents.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded slowly. She had argued this with Cranston, warning him to bring Natches and his cousins in on this phase of the investigation, but he had refused. Now she knew why.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLetting blood tell.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cDayle\u2019s going to think about this. He\u2019s going go think about that picture, think about what I could know, then he\u2019s going to call me. The break he\u2019s been waiting for. A sign of loyalty to him rather than to my cousins or my uncle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr your country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr my country,\u201d he agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ll set up the meet. Alex will cover me; he\u2019s a hell of a sniper. Dawg and Rowdy will back me up from a safe distance, and I\u2019ll get the information DHS needs.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to work. Any defense lawyer in the nation will blow you off the stand if you testify against him. With your family history, it will never work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only chance we have,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou go in wired . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWon\u2019t work; he\u2019ll check me for a wire, Chay. He\u2019s not incompetent, he\u2019s proved that already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA different sort of wire.\u201d She leaned forward intently. \u201cA cell phone, Natches, the receiver inside it will stay activated whether the cell phone is turned on or off. It\u2019s new. Something he won\u2019t suspect. You carry it right on your belt, in clear view. He\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her silently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even something our agents know about. Cranston had a friend of his working on it. It works; we\u2019ve tried it out several times. Reception is perfect. We could get the meeting recorded, get our evidence, and fry him and Nadine and all his friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo the agents working with you know about it?\u201d That was the risk, Natches thought. If this was something the other agents had known of, or discussed, then Dayle could already know about it and suspect.</p><p>But Chaya shook her head quickly. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, only three of us know about it. Cranston, me, and the electronics expert Cranston works with on the side. He\u2019s not even agency. And I know Cranston has it with him. He\u2019s just been waiting for a chance to test it.\u201d</p> <p>It could work. He narrowed his eyes, watching her silently for long moments. If it didn\u2019t work, if reception didn\u2019t go through, if the electronics failed, then what the hell. Nothing lost. Except blood. If DHS couldn\u2019t make the charges stick on Dayle, then Natches, as much as he was finding he hated the thought of it, would take care of things himself.</p><p>His home had been torn apart in the past year because of Johnny and Dayle\u2019s crimes. Once news had leaked of the activities some of their citizens had been involved in, the town had been left in a state of shock. It was time for it to end, one way or the other.</p><p>\u201cThis could work, Natches,\u201d Chaya urged him softly. \u201cWe can have the van in town before daylight if I contact Timothy now. I\u2019ll call Alex; he\u2019ll be able to get to Timothy without anyone else knowing. Everything can be ready and waiting before Dayle ever calls you.\u201d</p><p>What was there left to lose? If it worked, then he wouldn\u2019t have to face Chaya after shedding more blood. Despite what he had told Sheriff Mayes\u2014that killing Johnny was better than sex\u2014 he admitted now it had put a mark on his soul. Not a regret, but a knowledge that he sometimes found himself shying away from.</p><p>If he killed the man who sired him, what example then was he laying for his children? Children who would grow one day to no doubt hear the tale. Some secrets you just didn\u2019t keep when everyone pretty much knew everyone else.</p><p>\u201cCall Alex.\u201d He finally nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll get a message to Dawg and Rowdy. They can slip over without the eyes watching ever suspecting a thing. We\u2019ll get things ready to go.\u201d</p><p>Chaya felt her heart almost explode in joy. He wasn\u2019t dismissing the idea, he was embracing it. He didn\u2019t want her involved, but he was willing to allow her to back him, and that concession, she knew, hadn\u2019t been easy for him.</p><p>Being with Natches wasn\u2019t always going to be easy, she had found that out. When he decided something, he could obviously get incredibly stubborn about it, even with her. But he could listen to reason. That was all she asked of him, to listen to reason.</p> <p>\u201cLook at your face.\u201d His lips quirked with a hint of amusement as he reached out and touched her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019d think I just gave you diamonds.\u201d</p><p>Chaya shook her head slowly. \u201cSomething better than diamonds, Natches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could be better than diamonds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour trust.\u201d</p><p>Natches stared back at her now, almost confused. Chaya\u2019s eyes were shining, the golden brown a rich honey color, filled with warmth and some strange glow of happiness. Hell, a man would think he had just given her the crown jewels or something.</p><p>\u201cChay.\u201d He shook his head, letting his fingers trail down her cheek before pulling back and continuing to stare at that strange sight. \u201cBaby, you\u2019ve always had my trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of it, Natches.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNot when it came to being here for you, with you. It\u2019s something you don\u2019t even fully allow Dawg and Rowdy.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at that. \u201cI discussed this with them. We made up the plan together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you sent them away,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou gave them just enough to satisfy them, just enough to make them feel as though they were a part of it, but you were still going in alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still going in alone,\u201d he warned her, making certain she understood that. \u201cYou\u2019re not going in with me, Chay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll be there with you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be close. I\u2019ll know you\u2019re safe, and you\u2019re willing to allow that risk, so I can make certain you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d He rubbed at his jaw roughly. \u201cLike you\u2019d back down.\u201d He glowered back at her. \u201cYou\u2019d give me a run for stubborn any day, do you think I don\u2019t know it? You just came up with a solution I wasn\u2019t aware of. I\u2019d have figured something out before the meeting.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, he kept trying to tell himself. He\u2019d walk into the meeting, see what the hell was going on, get some information then hand Dayle Mackay over to Timothy Cranston and DHS. It was that simple. But he didn\u2019t intend to take any chances with Chaya\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cAnd let me tell you something now,\u201d she said then. \u201cEarlier, you said he created you. Dayle Mackay didn\u2019t create you. You made yourself. That\u2019s all any of us do.\u201d</p><p>Natches shook his head at that before reaching out and dragging her from the chair to his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dangerous woman,\u201d he told her as he held her against him. \u201cAnd maybe you\u2019re right. Either way, I\u2019ll be the one to bring him down. Now make that call to Alex and get your plan set up. I don\u2019t want Dayle calling before you have everything ready.\u201d</p><p>He let her go and watched as she moved across the room to retrieve the wireless earpiece to her laptop.</p><p>\u201cJust in case the cells aren\u2019t secure enough at the moment.\u201d She frowned as she sat down in front of the laptop. \u201cI prefer not to take chances.\u201d</p><p>She sent the encrypted e-mail quickly. A short, terse request for a new cell phone and accompanying accessories. Cranston would know what she was talking about.</p><p>Within minutes, his reply came through. An affirmative and already in place. As usual, Cranston was moving ahead of everyone else, she thought with a smile as Natches read the message over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d he muttered, but there was that vein of amusement again.</p><p>\u201cWhat time are Dawg and Rowdy supposed to be here?\u201d she asked as she rose to her feet and moved to him, eager, almost desperate to touch him now.</p><p>She needed him, a part of her was so hungry for him, to be held by him, that she wondered if she could bear to wait even as long as it would take to undress.</p><p>He caught her immediately, his arms, so strong and sure, wrappingaround her, lifting her to him. \u201cWe have plenty of time,\u201d he promised. \u201cGod, Chay, I\u2019d steal time if I had to for this.\u201d</p><p>He tumbled her to the couch, coming over her as his hands pushed at the cotton leggings she wore and stripped them from her.</p><p>His lips came over hers, his tongue delving deep, tangling with hers as her hands tore at his belt, at the fastening and zipper of his jeans.</p><p>It was always like this with Chaya. Wild and explosive, so searing that sometimes he wondered if he would survive it. And always desperate. As though a part of him couldn\u2019t believe she was actually here, in his arms, a part of his life.</p><p>He\u2019d let her run from him for too many years. Trying to let her have the time and the space she needed to come to grips with everything that had happened in her life. And he wondered if that hadn\u2019t been a mistake. For both of them. The years they had lost could never be returned. But they would ensure that he cherished every moment he had with her.</p><p>As he stripped off her clothes, then tore his own off, he stilled, staring down at her, naked and aroused, her body flushed and heated as he spread her thighs and moved slowly between them.</p><p>Her breasts were swollen, her little nipples peaked and hard, reaching out to him, eager for his hungry mouth. He took first one, then the other, sucking at the sweetness of her flesh and the tight warmth of the tender peaks. He kissed the curve of her breast, then her shoulder, as he rose over her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Chaya,\u201d he whispered in her ear as he began to press his cock inside her.</p><p>Instant, silken heat began to enclose his sensitive cock head. Liquid fire tightened around it and sucked him inside, inch by inch until he was gritting his teeth against the pleasure consuming him as he buried himself full length inside her.</p><p>It was like living in ecstasy, the moments that he was a part of her. The way she took him, so freely, without hesitation, giving every part of herself to him whether she realized it or not.</p><p>He had always known it. Whether it was one of the kisses he stole, or now, buried so deep inside her that he didn\u2019t know where he ended and she began, he could feel her soul clasping him. Just as surely as the depths of her pussy encased him, her soul encased him as well.</p><p>Natches sheltered her beneath him, held her to him and began to move, to thrust slow and easy inside her. Each penetration dragged a hard breath from his chest and caused her to breathe in roughly. She trembled beneath him, shuddered with the pleasure he gave her. She made him feel stronger than he knew he was, more powerful than he had ever imagined he could be.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Natches. It\u2019s so good.\u201d Her breathless cry sent a surge of pleasure racing up his spine.</p><p>\u201cHold on to me, Chay.\u201d Her arms were already wrapped tight around his shoulders, her nails digging into his flesh. He carried her marks every time he took her, and he gloried in it.</p><p>His head lifted so he could watch her face as he took her. Watch the flush that washed over her expression, the perspiration that gleamed against her flesh.</p><p>Nothing in his life had ever been so beautiful as Chaya in her passion. And nothing, no one, could strip his control from him as she did.</p><p>He moved against her, harder, deeper. He groaned out at the tight clasp, the feel of her pussy tightening around him, trying to hold him inside her each time he withdrew. The feel of her pleasure mounting, the convulsive clench of silken muscles around him, her rising cries, the demand in the return thrust of her hips.</p><p>He was losing control. He could feel it. His muscles tightened as he fought to hold back just a little bit longer, to feel just a little bit more of her pleasure.</p><p>Then she melted beneath him, around him. Her hips slammed into his and her cry filled his ears, and holding on was impossible.</p><p>Her name was on his lips as he thrust inside her again, again, lost in the release rising inside him until he buried inside her one last time and felt the hard, forceful jets of his release throbbing from his cock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nothing had ever been this good in his life. Nothing else had ever filled him, fulfilled him, as Chaya did.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered at his ear. \u201cGod help me, Natches, I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>And those words, they completed him.</p> <p>NINETEEN</p><p>Natches moved the Nauti Dreams from her berth beside his cousins\u2019 houseboats and pulled her into a spare slot at the other end of the marina. To preserve the illusion, he had told Chaya. His expression was still, too still and too quiet, as though he were with her in body only.</p><p>Chaya leaned against him as he maneuvered the craft from the second-floor control room. He sat back in the custom leather captain\u2019s chair, guided the huge craft into the empty slot, and watched as two of the marina\u2019s part-time workers secured her to the dock.</p><p>It was dark; clouds rolled over the moon and blocked the stars as a cold wind whipped around the glass-enclosed control room.</p><p>\u201cWhen this is over, we\u2019ll find a house,\u201d he said as he stared off into the mountains surrounding them. \u201cI think a baby needs a real house.\u201d</p> <p>Chaya pressed her lips together and found the ache and the panic building inside her at his voice.</p><p>\u201cA baby just needs a home, Natches,\u201d she told him softly. \u201cAnd two parents.\u201d</p><p>What he was getting ready to do wasn\u2019t without an element of danger. Chaya had read Dayle Mackay\u2019s Marine file. He had been a mess cook with control issues. He used his fists indiscriminately, not caring who he hurt, or how he hurt them. But he was proficient with weapons, namely, a knife. His hand-to-hand skill rating was high, and from everything else she knew about him, he didn\u2019t have a conscience.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t the thought of the physical danger that had him staring off into the distance; it was who he was going up against. What he was going against. The man who should have been his father.</p><p>\u201cI was seven the first time he locked me in the closet,\u201d he said. The lethal throb of cold determination in his voice had her hands tightening on his shoulders from where she stood behind him.</p><p>\u201cHe kept me in there until I thought I was going to die,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost two days. No food, no water. When he dragged me out, I was almost senseless with fear. After I managed to get cleaned up and he gave me a drink of water, I lied for him, just like he wanted me to do before he put me in that closet. And he told me, \u2018Loyalty, son. That\u2019s all I want from you. Just be loyal.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Natches couldn\u2019t even remember what his father had needed him to lie about at the time. Something inconsequential. It always was. Just something to prove his loyalty.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you want?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>Funny, he could hear the ache in her voice for him, just that easy. As though he were that much a part of her, that he knew how much she ached as he talked.</p><p>He had never felt another person the way he felt Chaya. The way he had always felt Chaya.</p><p>\u201cI caught Faisal\u2019s transmission the day they brought you into that camp,\u201d he said instead of answering her question. \u201cI checked the area, desperate for a place to hide you, because I just knew I was going to pull out a mess when I went in for you. The caves were a no go. It was the first place they would have checked. There was no other cover, no other place to hide but a hole.\u201d</p><p>Chaya felt her heart clench as he caught her hand and pulled her to his lap, surrounding her with warmth when she wanted to surround him with it.</p><p>\u201cI made that hole. I was going to shove you in it and try to find cover above you. I hate closed-in places, Chay. Dark, small places. That was always my weakness.\u201d</p> <p>His cheek brushed against her hair.</p><p>\u201cYou were in that hole with me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>And he nodded.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t leave you in there by yourself. You were all but blind, hurt. When I killed Nassar later, Chay, I think I scared myself, because I enjoyed it. I saw you, so brave and strong, and trying so hard to fight when you should have been leaning against me, crying, doing something other than storing your strength in case you had to go down fighting. And you would have gone down fighting.\u201d</p><p>She felt his heart beat beneath her cheek and held on to him, because he had forced himself into that hole with her.</p><p>\u201cI was losing it,\u201d she told him then. \u201cBefore you pulled me out of there. I was ready to break, Natches. And in that hole, when I heard them coming for us, I was screaming in my head until you kissed me.\u201d That kiss had pulled her back, it had saved her. \u201cYou made me strong. Because of you I was able to run. You held me up, you almost carried me. And because of you, I was able to stand the darkness in my own mind, and the fear that they were going to hurt me again. I didn\u2019t want to hurt anymore. And when I lost Beth. You kept me sane. With your touch, with your kiss, with all the wild pleasure you poured into me that night.\u201d She stared up at him, seeing his somber expression, even in the dark, her heart breaking for the man who had forced himself into that hole with her, and was now trying to face his own nightmare. Alone.</p><p>His expression was shadowed, dark, but his eyes were alive. And they brought tears to her eyes. Fierce, shockingly determined. He would do whatever he had to do to make sure Dayle Mackay never hurt anyone he loved, ever again.</p><p>\u201cClayton Winston called while you were in the shower earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cHe got to talk to Christopher. Then DHS called him back. They\u2019ve arranged transportation through a private broker to D.C., where he can see his son in a supervised visit.\u201d</p><p>Chaya closed her eyes, thankful Cranston had followed through with that.</p><p>\u201cClayton\u2019s dying,\u201d he said. \u201cDoctors don\u2019t think he\u2019ll see the year out. He needed this before he passes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you need, Natches?\u201d</p><p>It felt like an epitaph, the way he was talking, as though he wouldn\u2019t return to her, and she refused to consider that.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He lifted her from his lap and drew her through the doorway into the bedroom. There, he closed the door to the control room and locked it with a flick of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer me.\u201d She turned to face him in the darkness of the room. The drapes had been drawn that morning and the room was almost pitch black now.</p><p>He turned on the low lamp by the bed and turned to face her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming back to me,\u201d she whispered, her breath hitching. \u201cDon\u2019t you look at me like that. You\u2019re going to be covered, and you\u2019re coming back to me.\u201d</p><p>And tears filled her eyes, because she couldn\u2019t imagine anything less.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming back to you,\u201d he promised her. \u201cOne way or the other, I\u2019m coming back, Chay. But how will you see me, how will our child see me if I come back with blood on my hands?\u201d</p><p>His father\u2019s blood. She could see it in his face, his uncertainty that he could leave Dayle Mackay alive.</p><p>\u201cBullies are weak,\u201d she told him huskily. \u201cYou get what DHS needs and they\u2019ll break him. I swear to you, Natches, they\u2019ll break him and they\u2019ll put the rest of that group away for good. You\u2019ll win.\u201d</p><p>She knew they would. She was the interrogation specialist, but she only interrogated subjects of interest, she didn\u2019t interrogate suspects, nor did she interrogate suspected terrorists, homegrown or foreign. There was a division for that, men and women who made her worst nightmares seem like a picnic in the park.</p><p>He nodded. The confidence, the sheer knowledge in his eyes that he would do whatever it took to protect what belonged to him, humbled her. He tried to be a shield between the world and those he loved, always trying to protect them, to make certain danger never touched them. And he never expected, never asked, for the same, though he knew Dawg, Rowdy, and Ray Mackay had always been there for him. He had never asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good to go then.\u201d He nodded before moving to her, his lips settling on hers like a promise. A gentle, forever promise, as sweet and heated as a dream.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good to go.\u201d She nodded, and she pushed back the fears. She would cover the angles, she would create a bubble around him that could do nothing less than protect him from any outside forces.</p><p>But inside that bubble, Natches had to face the knowledge that he wasn\u2019t just betraying a monster. He also had to confront that last glimmer of hope, that the monster had a soul.</p><p>Monsters didn\u2019t have souls though, Natches assured himself as the meeting with his cousins and Alex Jansen drew to a close.</p><p>Not for the first time, he found himself amazed at Chaya\u2019s knowledge, and her ability to find workable solutions to the problems that were going to face them when it came to executing the plan they had conceived.</p><p>Illegal wiretapping was nothing new, and Cranston wasn\u2019t above using it to make certain a plan was coming together. A call had been made to Dayle Mackay by one of the men watching the Mackay cousins, informing him of the division between Natches and his cousins over an old picture, evidence against a citizen of Somerset in the stolen missiles case, and Natches\u2019s refusal to give the authorities pertinent information where that citizen was concerned.</p><p>And Dayle had been interested.</p><p>Natches listened to the other man\u2019s voice on the digital recording Alex had slipped in to him. The smug certainty in Dayle\u2019s voice\u2014that, finally, blood had thickened in Natches\u2019s veins and become more substantial than water.</p><p>He turned his back on his cousins as the recording played, kept his expression calm. This wasn\u2019t a Mackay he was going after; it was just another monster. Just as it had been in the Marines. It wasn\u2019t a person. It was a target, nothing more.</p><p>\u201cMoving the Nauti Dreams was also noted,\u201d Alex told them all softly and switched to the recording of another call. Natches\u2019s phone call to another marina and the arrangement of transportation for his houseboat was given as well. With each call, Dayle became more confident, more certain that his son and cousins were finally making the split he had been waiting on.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my boy,\u201d Dayle mused softly, smugly. \u201cI knew it wouldn\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the woman? The agent with him?\u201d the voice on the other end questioned him. Daniel Reynolds was one of the men in the photo, one of the fanatical leaders of the future revolution.</p><p>\u201cWomen are easy to get rid of,\u201d Dayle snorted. \u201cAn accident, a few little drugs popped into her drink, and she does the bar on a Saturday night. Natches\u2019ll drop her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still an agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t have the information he has,\u201d Dayle pointed out. \u201cNo doubt, that relationship will terminate soon enough, on its own. I\u2019ll call him soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain about this?\u201d the other voice pushed determinedly. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to mess up.\u201d</p><p>Dayle laughed at the question. \u201cTrust me, Daniel, I know my son. I knew it was just a matter of time. The boy\u2019s a killer. He was a killer in the Marines, and he\u2019ll always be a killer. That kind of cold only adheres to its own kind. He\u2019ll come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Daniel agreed. \u201cArrange the meeting and contact us when you\u2019ve finished.\u201d</p><p>The sound of the recorder disengaging flipped a switch in his mind. Cold. Hard. Yeah, he was a killer. He turned slowly to meet his cousins\u2019 eyes.</p><p>\u201cChaya, do you still have those files?\u201d He knew she did.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re upstairs in my case.\u201d She moved for the staircase but not before she cast him a suspicious look.</p><p>As she disappeared upstairs he looked at his family. His cousins and the man he called friend.</p><p>\u201cThis might not go as easy as she thinks it will,\u201d he told them quietly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, you take care of her and my child.\u201d He looked to Dawg and Rowdy. \u201cGive him what Uncle Ray always gave me, and make it stick.\u201d</p><p>Dawg and Rowdy glanced at each other.</p><p>\u201cMan, this is going to be a walk in the park,\u201d Dawg protested. \u201cAlex has point, your woman has your wire, DHS in the van, and me and Rowdy in place. Nothing\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Dawg\u2019s gaze sharpened. \u201cUnless you do something dumb. You gonna do some-thin\u2019 dumb, Natches?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Natches\u2019s lips quirked at the question. \u201cHave I ever done things any other way, cousin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to do things right, or he\u2019ll find me standing beside him.\u201d</p> <p>Natches jerked around, frowning at Chaya, who didn\u2019t have those files in her hand. But her hand was propped on her hip and her expression was something just this side of pissed off.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Natches?\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head smoothly. \u201cI\u2019ll play by the plan,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>But he knew Dayle. And he knew Dayle would never play by any kind of rules. This was it and he knew it. When he walked out of that meeting, one way or the other, it was going to be over.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t believe a word he was saying.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s the cell phone.\u201d Alex pulled the phone out of his pocket and handed it across the table. \u201cCranston\u2019s proud as hell of this little puppy. He said not to break it; it\u2019s the only prototype they\u2019ve managed to complete successfully.\u201d</p><p>Natches lifted the phone from the table, flipped it open, and checked it for anything that Dayle could use to identify it as a wire rather than a phone.</p><p>\u201cIt even makes phone calls,\u201d Chaya told him with a hard smile.</p><p>\u201cCranston has the van parked in town, one agent inside. As soon as he has the location point he can park it within half a mile and still receive clear reception,\u201d Alex informed them. \u201cAs far as any listening ears at the hotel could know, he\u2019s raging over Natches\u2019s refusal to join the team or to help Agent Dane complete her mission. He\u2019s making plans to pull out of Somerset once she contacts him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich will be tonight,\u201d she told them. \u201cI\u2019ll contact Cranston and inform him that he should pick me up in the morning and that I\u2019ll be returning to D.C. with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I assume Dayle will make his call.\u201d Natches nodded.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to activate the cell phone to your number rather than using your own cell,\u201d Chaya told him. \u201cWe want a recording of it. Calls will transmit with no possible trace outside the half-mile limit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be ready to move when Cranston gives the order.\u201d Alex nodded to Dawg and Rowdy. \u201cWe\u2019ll have everything in place and ready to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019ll have his own watchers,\u201d Natches warned them.</p><p>\u201cHe has six we\u2019ve identified, and we\u2019ll have men covering them. We\u2019ll allow them to stay in place until the last minute before taking them out.\u201d</p><p>It was a damned good plan. Natches nodded to the three men as he curled his arms around Chaya and pulled her back against his chest, one hand against her lower stomach as he stared back at his cousins, his look intent.</p><p>They knew. Brief nods assured him they knew. If anything happened to him, then Chaya was to be protected, just as he would have protected one of their wives, one of their children.</p><p>They had made that vow long ago and far away. Three boys that should have been brothers, that had wished they were. They had become brothers. And they had made that vow, what belonged to one was the others\u2019 to protect. That simple.</p><p>Chaya felt his hand on her stomach and stared at Dawg and Rowdy fiercely. No matter what Natches wanted, he was to be protected. Their gazes flickered to her, then back to Natches, and she hoped, she prayed that the nod they gave was an affirmative to that silent demand.</p> <p>The Nauti Boys were thick as thieves, it was said. Their loyalty was to each other and to family alone. That bond would protect Natches.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re out of here then.\u201d Alex got to his feet and looked to the back of the boat. \u201cDamn, that water\u2019s fuckin\u2019 cold tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kelly and Crista have electric blankets and hot coffee waiting on us. That\u2019s the best you\u2019re going to do tonight, Alex,\u201d Dawg informed him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the two of you curl up with a warm body, and I get stuck with an electric blanket,\u201d he grunted. \u201cI always get the short end of the deal with you boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and we\u2019ll remind you of that one of these days.\u201d</p><p>They disappeared along the hallway, silence slowly descending through the houseboat. There wasn\u2019t a splash, a dip of the boat, or a slide of a door to indicate they had left.</p><p>\u201cCome sit with me.\u201d Natches drew her to the couch, but rather than sitting, he stretched out on the cushions and drew her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cJust sit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me hold you.\u201d He tucked her close, his body warm and hard, strong and secure.</p><p>\u201cStop making this feel like a funeral, Natches. Nothing is going to happen.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at that, then sobered. \u201cYou know, Chay, the last time I spoke to him I was twenty. I had cracked ribs, one was broken, my mouth was full of blood, and I could have sworn I was dying. I told him, as Dawg, Rowdy, and Uncle Ray dragged me off of that floor, that the next time I spoke to him, I\u2019d kill him.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d spat his blood on the bastard\u2019s shoes and made a vow, and Dayle had laughed at him. Natches had never forgotten that gloating laugh; he had heard it again tonight.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to kill him,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d Natches smiled as she stiffened in his arms, and at the thought of what he was going to do to Dayle. \u201cBetraying him to DHS will be the same as death for him. It\u2019s the ultimate revenge for me. Because I\u2019ll know, every day, that he\u2019s breathing; we\u2019ll both know I beat him.\u201d</p><p>He held that inside him, though he knew clear to his gut that things weren\u2019t going to be that easy. He was a Marine. A sniper. An assassin. He\u2019d always worked alone, without a spotter, sometimes without extraction. Because shit happened after blood was shed, and when shit happened, information came out. He\u2019d learned to go with his gut. To know when to run and when to hang around. And when something wasn\u2019t going to go as planned.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t going to go as planned.</p><p>And if it all went to hell and back, then he wanted this night. He wanted to hold her, he wanted to talk to her.</p><p>His hand slid along her stomach once again.</p><p>\u201cIf our child is a boy, I want to teach him to play baseball,\u201d he told her softly.</p><p>She laughed at that. A soft, amused little sound that had a smile curling at his lips.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a girl, you\u2019ll be a tyrant.\u201d</p><p>A girl? A frown drew at his brows. A daughter, with her mother\u2019s hair and eyes and, God help him, Mackay blood. He shuddered. \u201cI\u2019ll lock her up until she turns fifty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not.\u201d Her hand covered his, her fingers twining those of his other hand as it lay on her thigh.</p><p>\u201cI promise you. Till she\u2019s fifty. That girl will be wilder than the wind and harder to control than a green mule.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, the dim light in the room catching the sparkle in her eyes, the love, the concern, the fears that would ride her until this was finished.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be a lady.\u201d The sound of her laughter was almost a giggle, because she knew better, just as he did.</p><p>\u201cWild as the wind,\u201d he argued again.</p><p>\u201cAnd a boy wouldn\u2019t be?\u201d She reached up and touched his face, and that touch, tenderness and warmth combined, was another memory he stored inside him.</p><p>\u201cBoys are different,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She frowned, just as he knew she would. \u201cHow do you figure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys are born to be wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd girls are born to tame the wind,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWhat are you doing, Natches?\u201d</p><p>He knew what she was talking about. Why was he just holding her, just talking, just building memories?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m creating my shield.\u201d He lowered his head and kissed her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re my shield, Chay, you just don\u2019t know it. Soft and sweet, born to tame the wind and to tempt my dreams. When I walk into that meeting, I want to carry this with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for long moments, wondering if there was any way to make her understand.</p><p>\u201cSo I won\u2019t kill him,\u201d he finally admitted. \u201cBecause this memory and all the others will be wrapped around me, and I\u2019ll remember what you\u2019re fighting for and how important keeping him alive really is. You\u2019re the only thing standing between him and death, Chay. Just this, and knowing he\u2019s more important to your fight than he is to mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be your shield,\u201d she whispered, turning, facing him, embracing him. \u201cAlways, Natches, I\u2019ll be your shield.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>He didn\u2019t make love to her that night. He waited until the sun rose and carried her to the bed. There, he stripped her slowly, gently, and gazed at the woman splayed out before him.</p><p>Sweetly rounded breasts, her nipples hard and red. Her stomach was smooth, only slightly rounded. There was no sign yet that his child rested there, but he knew it did.</p><p>Sweetly curved thighs, and between them, silky bare flesh.</p><p>The hours he had spent holding her, kissing her, stroking her, had stoked the fires inside them to a burning simmer. Something Natches had never known before. It was the first time in his life he had ever spent time just holding a woman, just stroking her, just laying velvet kisses wherever he could reach.</p><p>He\u2019d been hard for hours. He could have fucked her ten times over in the time he had taken just loving her on that couch. But he wouldn\u2019t have traded it for anything he\u2019d known in the past. Each touch, each kiss, each little laugh, sigh, and whispered love word had bound them closer together.</p><p>She had felt it. He felt it. He knew there were silken-wrapped chains in his soul now, and they led back to her. The burn was now a flame though. Natches smiled down at her, wild, wicked hunger raging inside him.</p><p>He\u2019d been born as wild as the wind, and like the wind, he had torn through his own life, whipping around it without direction, shearing his own dreams as he moved, until he met Chaya.</p><p>And she had been born to tame that wind inside him. Not the man, she made the man wild, made him hungry. But the rage, the burning fury that had driven him before that day in a dry, hot desert, was now tamed, held in the hands of one tender woman.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to just stare at me all morning?\u201d She stretched beneath his gaze, her eyes flickering to where he stroked his cock, anticipating, holding back that final moment when he would have to let her go.</p><p>\u201cWould you let me?\u201d He smiled, using one finger to trace a line from between her breasts to the silken, soft mound between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cIf that was what you wanted to do.\u201d She lifted her hands and let her fingers trail along the path he had made. \u201cI didn\u2019t take you for a watcher, Natches. Though I\u2019m sure we could adapt if that\u2019s your kink.\u201d</p><p>If that was his kink? He almost laughed; he did smile. God, he loved her. Smart mouth and all.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it is my kink?\u201d He lifted his brows curiously. Not that it was, but he could play with her. That was the joy with Chaya, she enjoyed playing. Even patched and healing in that hospital in Iraq, she had enjoyed playing with him.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it too bad you broke my vibrator then?\u201d She let her fingers whisper over her mound before returning, stroking along the top of the glistening slit.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d come in his own hand at this rate.</p><p>\u201cYou would have let me watch?\u201d He hadn\u2019t anticipated that.</p><p>\u201cOh, I would have,\u201d she whispered, letting her finger dip into the folds, her hips arching as he watched. \u201cI would have shown you how I survived five years without you. I would have let you watch, and let you hear me crying because I couldn\u2019t reach the same peak you could bring me to. Would you like to see that?\u201d</p><p>See her cry? God no.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d finish you, baby,\u201d he promised her. \u201cI\u2019ll let you show me how you do it, then I\u2019d show you how it\u2019s done.\u201d His wicked smile drew a light vein of laughter from her, a twinkle of the same wicked hunger to her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen show me how it\u2019s done.\u201d Her fingers lifted from her flesh, dewy with her juices and he couldn\u2019t help himself. He snagged her wrist and brought her fingers to his lips.</p><p>Her taste exploded against his tongue. Sweet and earthy. Nothing tasted as good as Chaya\u2019s passion. He covered the tips of her tasty fingers, licked them clean, and watched her eyes darken as he caressed the sensitive tips with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you exactly how it should be done,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou should be savored.\u201d</p> <p>He stretched out between her thighs, pressed them wide, and blew a breath across the dampened flesh, his gaze lifting to her as a tremor shook her body. \u201cSavored in the most delicious ways. With a kiss.\u201d He covered her hard little clit in a heated kiss, nudged it with his tongue, and felt it throb in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cJust a kiss?\u201d Her voice was hoarse with pleasure now.</p><p>\u201cHmm. A kiss wasn\u2019t enough?\u201d He kissed the silken folds, drew the taste of her juices onto his tongue, and hummed in appreciation.</p><p>\u201cNot enough.\u201d Her hands were in his hair now as she tried to press him closer.</p><p>\u201cA taste?\u201d He dipped his tongue inside those luscious folds, licked softly, slowly, felt the soft flutter at the entrance of her core and the echo of the clenching need building in the muscles there.</p> <p>\u201cTaste isn\u2019t enough.\u201d She writhed beneath him, her hips arching, pressing her pussy closer to his mouth as he kissed and licked and listened to her cries of pleasure building in his head.</p><p>Making love. He\u2019d never made love before Chaya, but that was what he was doing now. Making love to her. Loving her with everything inside his soul.</p><p>\u201cKissing or tasting?\u201d His own voice was ragged now. \u201cDemanding little thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head, smiling back at her as she watched him, lashes lowered sensually, a sheen of perspiration on her face now.</p><p>And those sweet, lush breasts. They were swollen, her nipples hard, tight, and flushed with need. He couldn\u2019t help but lift one hand, slide it over her stomach, and cup one of those sweet mounds as he went back to kissing, tasting. And licking. He licked around her clit. He laid little kisses on it, pursing his lips and drawing it inside the heat of his mouth until she unraveled beneath him, arched and cried his name in release.</p><p>Before the tremors finished sweeping through her, he jerked to his knees, lifted her legs until they lay against his chest, and began working his cock inside her.</p> <p>Fuck. She was tight. So hot he had to clench his teeth, tried valiantly to think about car motors, anything, everything but the destructive, velvet grip encasing his cock.</p><p>And nothing worked. Nothing filled his mind but the scent and the feel of her. Her voice crying out his name, her hands gripping his wrists as he held on to her hips. Until he was buried fully inside her, balls deep in the sweetest, slickest haven a man\u2019s soul could ever find.</p><p>\u201cNatches. Oh God, it\u2019s so good.\u201d</p><p>Good wasn\u2019t even a description. There was no description for this pleasure; it defied any poet\u2019s ability to voice it. He tightened, arched deeper inside her and felt the sweat running down his chest as sensation upon sensation whipped over his body, dug into his nerve endings and filled him with ecstasy.</p><p>His head lowered until he could kiss her ticklish little ankle, before she jerked, a panting little cry falling from her lips.</p><p>He glanced up at her and grinned before licking over the side of her foot. And she moaned, her foot flexing as he lifted one hand from her hip to her foot, and as he began to thrust, let his teeth bite down, just below her big toe.</p><p>Chaya screamed with the sensation. He bit her. Bit her foot and thrust inside her, once, twice, and she was coming again. Exploding into a million brilliant fragments as his hips moved harder, moved faster. He was pounding into her, his expression tightening, sweat rolling down his neck as she felt herself flying from one peak to another, then joining him as his release flowed into her.</p><p>She watched him, the way his eyes narrowed on her, became sensual and heavy a second before they closed and a shudder wracked his body.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t get enough of you,\u201d he breathed out roughly as he collapsed over her, allowing her legs to embrace his hips before sliding to the bed. \u201cEvery time, I only want you more.\u201d</p><p>Running her fingers through his hair she smiled. \u201cGood. Because I can\u2019t get enough either.\u201d</p><p>He rolled to his back, dragging her to him until she was draped over his chest, weak and exhausted and knowing there was no time to sleep.</p><p>They lay like that, their hearts finally easing in their chests, their breathing returning to normal.</p><p>\u201cWhen you leave the boat, don\u2019t look back,\u201d he told her. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, don\u2019t pause. You\u2019re a woman walking away from something she can\u2019t deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how to do my job.\u201d But her voice caught on a sob. Walking away from Natches without looking back?</p><p>\u201cI know you do. But it won\u2019t be easy, Chay. And you can\u2019t pause. You have to keep going.\u201d</p><p>She nodded against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI have a duffel packed for you. Some clean clothes Dawg brought over in a plastic bag last night. Your other clothes. You\u2019ll take your briefcase, but only your laptop inside it. They can tell by the way you carry it, the way you move, the way it hangs from your shoulder or your hand if there\u2019s anything more in it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>\u201cWhen it happens, when I meet with him, you\u2019re not to come near until he\u2019s cuffed. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>His voice was so hard, his tone cool, but she could feel the emotions coursing beneath the surface. As able as she knew she was, she had also come to realize something. He called her his strength, but she could also become his weakness. Just as he could become hers if anyone ever wanted to hurt him to strike back at her.</p><p>\u201cNot until he\u2019s cuffed,\u201d she agreed, praying she could keep that promise.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you ready to go then.\u201d He lifted her from his chest and moved from the bed with her.</p><p>Standing beside it, he touched her face and gave her a hard, lingering kiss.</p><p>\u201cWhen I get you back here, you\u2019re not getting out of the bed for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least a week,\u201d she promised, standing still as he moved back and stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d she finally told him. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be alone with him.\u201d</p><p>His smile was tinged with bitterness, but no regret. \u201cI won\u2019t be. Remember? You\u2019re my shield.\u201d</p><p>And she had to be content with that.</p><p>\u201cGo shower. I\u2019ll get your things together.\u201d</p><p>And then she would leave him alone. Alone to think, alone to remember, and Chaya knew it. Just as she knew there was no other way to convince the monster that Natches was alone.</p><p>Leaving him this time was breaking her heart.</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Natches gave Chaya time to get started up the boardwalk before he stepped onto the deck of his houseboat to watch her leave.</p><p>Instantly he felt the rifle scope between his eyes, which meant, hopefully, he was drawing it away from Chaya. He smirked at the would-be assassin, daring him to take the shot, knowing none would be taken. But he was smart enough, instinctive enough to feel it.</p><p>Then he turned his gaze back to Chaya, keeping his expression carefully mocking, as though watching her walk away meant nothing to him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t forever, he reminded himself. Hell no. After this, he was never going to watch Chaya walk away from him again, he would make damned sure of it.</p><p>Shaking his head as though amused at something, he turned and walked back into the living room and closed the door behind him.</p><p>Chaya\u2019s cell phone was tucked at his belt; it was turned on. According to her, even disabling the battery wouldn\u2019t disable the wire.</p><p>All he had to do now was wait for Dayle Mackay to learn Chaya had left and to call. And he would call. Cranston was betting against it, as was Alex. Three against two, because Dawg, Rowdy, and Natches all knew Dayle would call.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to wait long. Two hours that he spent pacing the living room, going over the plan, trying to make certain he\u2019d considered every angle, and the cell phone rang.</p><p>He unclipped it unhurriedly and flipped it open before bringing it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d As though he didn\u2019t know who the hell it was.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk, son.\u201d Grating, smug, Dayle\u2019s voice came over the line clearly.</p><p>Natches stayed still, his fists clenching. He took the phone from his ear and flipped it closed, disconnecting the call. He didn\u2019t want to appear too eager, did he? He had to swallow back the urge to throw up at the sheer confidence in Dayle\u2019s voice.</p><p>How could anyone deceive himself to the extent that Dayle had, believing he would ever carry the right to call Natches \u201cson\u201d? Even with the slight evidence Dayle had been given, how could he ever imagine Natches would have a desire to speak to him? To kill, yeah, killing him might assuage a hell of a lot of anger, but in the long run, it would only end up pissing Natches off more.</p><p>Natches liked to think he wasn\u2019t a man who fooled himself easily. He\u2019d thought Dayle wasn\u2019t. It seemed he was wrong, because a half hour later, the phone range again.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d was his answer.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Dayle repeated, his voice throttled, anger evident in it.</p><p>\u201cAbout what? Your treasonous activities? They\u2019ve already caused me enough problems if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he sneered. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to save the world, try to do it without involving me. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Save the world his ass. He almost choked on that one. Damn, he\u2019d thought he was a better actor than this.</p><p>Dayle said nothing for long moments. \u201cSome information is dangerous to have, Natches,\u201d he finally replied.</p><p>\u201cYeah, so pull the damned trigger next time I step outside, why don\u2019t you? That would just solve all our problems.\u201d</p><p>Dayle chuckled. \u201cThat sixth sense of yours has always been good. Come to your aunt Nadine\u2019s house, Natches. One hour. Just give me a few minutes to talk to you; that\u2019s all I\u2019m asking for. Believe it or not, we might have a few things in common.\u201d</p><p>Uh-huh. They sure did. His blood and the fact that Natches really wanted to spill it.</p><p>But he stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine we have anything in common,\u201d he finally stated. \u201cAnd I doubt Nadine would let me in the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne hour, Natches.\u201d Dayle\u2019s voice gentled, and it sounded sickening. \u201cI\u2019ll be there waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>This time Dayle disconnected.</p><p>Natches flipped the phone closed and returned it to the clip on his belt. He checked the clock. It was barely nine and he needed a beer. Hell, whiskey. The bastard was driving him to drink.</p><p>He pushed his fingers through his hair and walked upstairs. He buckled the black leather chaps he used for riding the Harley in winter over his jeans and pulled on the heavy boots he wore when riding the powerful machine.</p><p>The leather jacket, scuffed and beaten, was pulled from the closet and thrown to the bed as he moved to the dresser. He tucked a knife in the side of his boot. Picking up the jacket, he walked downstairs and pulled a beer from the refrigerator.</p><p>Hell, he wished Chaya was here. He\u2019d lie on the couch with her again, hold her, and reinforce the shield. His lips quirked at the thought of that. It had taken him long enough to get beneath her shields, but once he had, the woman he found beneath there was more than a match for him. And he liked that; he liked that fine.</p><p>He finished the beer, tossed it in the trash, and moved to the couch to wait. He\u2019d wait that hour before he left the houseboat. There was no sense in arriving early, or even on time. He may as well make an entrance when he arrived. He and Dayle Mackay had never pretended to stand on ceremony with each other.</p><p>He pushed his fingers through his hair and thought of the team moving into place. They knew where Dayle\u2019s spotters were; that would make it easier. Natches knew Alex and his team\u2014they didn\u2019t make mistakes. And Dawg and Rowdy were black death when they wanted to be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He waited. He didn\u2019t pace; instead, he sat on the couch and stared around the living room. He thought of the house Dawg had nearly completed farther in the mountains. There was land close to him, and it wasn\u2019t but a few miles from the house Rowdy and Kelly were building. He could buy that land, build him and Chaya a home. A place to love and to raise their babies.</p><p>Lots of bedrooms, he thought. He wanted to fill her life with babies and with laughter. Both their lives. He wanted to be the husband he\u2019d dreamed of being with her, the father he\u2019d never had.</p><p>When the clock showed five minutes past the hour, he stood and left the houseboat. He paused on the deck as though considering turning back, then shook his head and moved to the docks, striding quickly to the small metal building Ray had allowed them to set up to park the Harleys in. He took his time getting it out and checking it over.</p> <p>Half an hour and he was on the road. He didn\u2019t rush, there was no need to. Dark glasses protected his eyes from the cold wind, but it ruffled through his hair, clearing his head.</p><p>He pushed thoughts of Chaya and babies as far back in his mind as he could, though he admitted, that wasn\u2019t far. Hatred, a child\u2019s rage and pain, and the fear of the dark that kid had known. He erased it from his mind. It was just another mission he told himself. Except this time, he wasn\u2019t going to kill.</p><p>He pulled onto the side of the street before Nadine\u2019s driveway forty-five minutes past the deadline and parked the Harley before cutting the motor and stepping off. Far enough away that he\u2019d be surprising them.</p><p>He\u2019d passed the dark panel van parked on the street, blending in with the SUVs and pickups it shared space with. Wasn\u2019t Nadine nice? Why, she had bought her a nice little place in the middle of town. Made things so much easier. But it didn\u2019t make this any easier.</p><p>Stepping up to the door, he didn\u2019t bother to knock. He pushed open and stepped into the living room before coming to a rocking stop.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re determined to make me puke this morning,\u201d he stated as he watched his aunt jump from Dayle\u2019s lap and Dayle pull his hand slowly from beneath the silk dress she was wearing.</p><p>Nadine didn\u2019t even bother to flush. Actually, she let a nervous little smile touch her lips; it was almost welcoming.</p><p>What dimension of the twilight zone did he step into? Natches wondered as he lifted his brow and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cWe thought you weren\u2019t arriving.\u201d Dayle rose to his feet, adjusting the polo shirt he wore and the creased slacks.</p><p>He looked as powerful as he ever had. Six feet plus, wider than Natches, broader. Older, Natches reminded himself as he hooked his thumbs in the top of the chaps he wore and stared at the man who dared call him son.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I was either.\u201d He shrugged and stared at Nadine as she twisted her hands together nervously and glanced between Dayle and Natches. \u201cWhat\u2019s her problem?\u201d</p> <p>Dayle smiled. \u201cShe wants to welcome you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Natches arched his brows. \u201cHow interesting. Last I heard, she wanted to gut me for popping Johnny\u2019s head off for him. Changed her mind rather fast, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>She paled, swaying as Dayle put his arm around her and whispered something in her ear before nodding toward the back of the house. Giving him a grateful look, she accepted his kiss on the lips before moving through the house.</p><p>Natches shook his head. \u201cYou know, that relationship you have going on there never did make sense to me. She had her brother\u2019s kid, and you\u2019re not the brother. No wonder Johnny was so screwed up. Now she just wants to welcome me right into the family as though she never hated my guts? You two been doing hard drugs or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always were a smart-mouthed little bastard,\u201d Dayle snapped irritably.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do good at that.\u201d Natches grinned in pride. \u201cSo, what the hell do you want and how do I return things to where you ignore me rather than harass me?\u201d</p><p>Dayle grimaced, his lined face tightening into displeasure as he pushed his hair, still thick and barely graying, back from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cLittle whelp,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou don\u2019t even look like me. If it wasn\u2019t for those eyes of yours I\u2019d swear you weren\u2019t even mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe Chandler was my daddy as well as Johnny\u2019s,\u201d Natches mocked. \u201cFrom what I remember, it could be possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought of that,\u201d Dayle snapped. \u201cEven had the paternity test done. No such luck, you\u2019re mine. And now it\u2019s time we both come to terms with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you suggest we do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I am, what I\u2019m a part of.\u201d Dayle sighed. \u201cI always knew you\u2019d remember it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you hired Linkins to try to kill me in Iraq?\u201d</p><p>Dayle shrugged again. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy order to give. And I have to admit, I wasn\u2019t disappointed when it failed.\u201d</p><p>Natches forced himself to keep from curling his fingers into fists.</p><p>\u201cThe strike order on the hotel where Chaya\u2019s husband and child were?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnother attempt?\u201d</p><p>Dayle\u2019s eyes widened, then narrowed. \u201cThat had nothing to do with you or the girl. I didn\u2019t find out about your relationship with her until later. And I didn\u2019t give that order, that came from one of our founding members based there at the time. Craig Cornwell was working for us. We had no idea he was working for the enemy,too, until then. We couldn\u2019t risk his capture. He would have talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know how the hell you managed it. A strike order, authenticated and radioed to the planes. That seems pretty much impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrders get messed up sometimes.\u201d Dayle shrugged. \u201cThe commander only knew the orders he received. We just had to get them through the proper channels. As I said, Iraq wasn\u2019t my call. I\u2019m a recruiter, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a very good recruiter,\u201d Natches informed him. \u201cI\u2019ve been checking up on you a bit. Dishonorably discharged, malcontents, some of your boys aren\u2019t even in the military. Those that are still there are just a breath from being tossed into Leavenworth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they know where our leaders are taking us,\u201d Dayle snarled. \u201cSomeone has to pave the way. The revolution is building, Natches. You can be a part of it. You can be at my side as a general and a leader now that you\u2019ve disassociated yourself from Ray\u2019s little bastards.\u201d</p><p>And here it was. Natches grinned in full-throttled smug triumph. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019ve done that?\u201d</p><p>Dayle tensed. \u201cMy reports are that you\u2019re arguing over information you\u2019re refusing to turn over to DHS. That you\u2019re protecting me.\u201d Pride flared in his eyes.</p><p>Natches let himself chuckle at that one. \u201cNah, not really. They\u2019re just a little ticked off at me right now because I wouldn\u2019t let them in on the fun. No, sorry, Dayle, I\u2019m here to bust your ass.\u201d</p><p>Dayle froze, his eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d Natches grinned. \u201cReal serious. See, those guys you had targeting me in their gunsights? Dawg and Rowdy have them already. Go ahead. Try to call one of them.\u201d</p><p>Dayle pulled his cell phone from his belt and punched a number in. Listened. Tried another. Another. Yeah, Dawg and Rowdy were black death when they wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say there\u2019s some blood fertilizing a few areas.\u201d Natches nodded. \u201cIt was a good try though. Too bad you didn\u2019t pay attention to the fact that I don\u2019t even fucking hate you. I just basically want to see you locked up until hell freezes over, knowing I put you there.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, this was better than a bullet. He watched Dayle pale, watched his shoulder twitch as he prepared to go for his weapon.</p><p>Natches went for his first. He pulled the Glock from the back holster beneath his jacket, holding it comfortably on his father.</p><p>\u201cDid you really think you were going to convince me to help you do anything?\u201d Natches asked him. \u201cI ask again, are you on hard drugs?\u201d</p><p>Dayle\u2019s lips thinned as he watched Natches lean against the wall, the gun held easily, pointing directly at him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t prove any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Course I can. I\u2019m wired.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>Dayle grinned at that. \u201cNot here you aren\u2019t, Natches. Any wire you wore was jammed the minute you walked in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCell phones aren\u2019t jammed, are they?\u201d</p><p>Dayle glanced at his cell. \u201cYours isn\u2019t open though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t have to be.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI got ya. DHS has ya. Busted, old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Natches swung around, the gun barreling on Nadine\u2019s voice as he felt his stomach drop.</p><p>Janey. For a moment, fear had nearly paralyzed him, the thought of Chaya uppermost in his mind. But now, the fear nearly burned through his mind. Chaya could have worked with him; she would have known what to do. But it wasn\u2019t Chaya Nadine held by long, thick black hair. It wasn\u2019t Chaya who stared at him from dazed, confused eyes.</p><p>\u201cInsurance.\u201d Dayle sighed. \u201cPut the gun down, and hand me the cell phone, please.\u201d</p><p>Natches watched as Nadine leveled her own gun at Janey\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to kill her,\u201d she told him vindictively. \u201cPop her little head right off, just like you did Johnny\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Natches lowered the gun, shifted away from the wall and forced Nadine in a better alignment with the window as he came closer to her.</p><p>Be in position, Alex, he prayed. God help them all, he better be in position.</p><p>He pulled the cell phone from his belt and tossed it to Dayle. He almost winced as Dayle cracked it against the table, busting the frame before he dropped it into the vase of water that held fresh flowers. So much for Cranston\u2019s new toy.</p><p>\u201cThe gun, Natches.\u201d Dayle waggled his fingers demandingly. \u201cLet\u2019s not . . .\u201d</p><p>Pop.</p><p>Nadine went down, dragging Janey with her as Dayle jumped him. The fist that plowed into Natches\u2019s jaw felt like a jackhammer. He went backward, the gun flying, clattering to the floor before he righted himself and faced an enraged Dayle.</p><p>\u201cJust like Johnny,\u201d Natches snarled. \u201cWhat now, bastard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I beat you to fucking death like I should have when you were a snot-nosed kid,\u201d Dayle snarled.</p><p>Natches laughed as he shed his coat, feeling the blood pump through his body, adrenaline racing through his veins.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a kid now, old man,\u201d he sneered. \u201cCome and get me. We\u2019ll see who ends up with the busted ribs this time.\u201d</p><p>The second Chaya realized Nadine Grace had a hostage, and who it was, panic nearly flared in her throat.</p><p>\u201cWe have a hostage situation.\u201d She spoke quietly into the mic at her cheek that connected her to the team surrounding the house.</p><p>Alex was the closest in position, stretched out on the roof across the street, hidden from view by the branches of an aged oak growing beside it.</p><p>\u201cAlex, confirm visual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfirmed. Target acquired.\u201d</p><p>She heard the pop of the sniper rifle, her eyes widening as Cranston began to curse and order all agents to converge on the house.</p><p>\u201cAll agents, be advised, don\u2019t interfere. Cover only. This is Natches\u2019s fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d Cranston turned back to her, his eyes bugging out of his head. \u201cNatches will kill him.\u201d He pulled his own mic closer to his mouth. \u201cAll agents, detain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Before Cranston could stop her she pulled the plug on his communications unit and stared back at him furiously. \u201cStop fighting me so I can get to Natches. We cover him, that\u2019s it. This is his fight, Cranston. No matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if his father manages to get a killing blow in? What then, Agent Dane?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She breathed in roughly. \u201cThen I\u2019ll deal with it, Timothy. It\u2019s his fight. It\u2019s his pride. I won\u2019t take it from him.\u201d</p><p>He cursed again, turned from her, and a second later they were running from the van to the sidewalk, racing to the two-story brick house that sat peacefully amid the residential street.</p><p>Neighbors were stepping from their houses as the sheriff\u2019s car sped down the street, sirens wailing. And she wondered how Timothy had managed to keep Zeke from coming in sooner.</p> <p>They rushed the house. Dawg and Rowdy with their black law enforcement vests made it there first. The door splintered as they went through it, and stood blocking the living room, staring back at Natches and Dayle Mackay in shock.</p><p>They were brutal. Fists were slamming into faces. Natches\u2019s jaw and lip were bleeding; Dayle probably had teeth missing though. He was bleeding profusely from the mouth, stumbling back as Natches buried his fist in his ribs. And from the grunt of pain, it wasn\u2019t the first time.</p><p>Dayle went to one knee, staggered, and then pulled himself back up. Lowering his head he charged Natches. A second later, he came up on his tiptoes, a wet groan leaving his throat as Natches buried his fist in his stomach and threw him back.</p><p>\u201cHave you had enough?\u201d Natches\u2019s drawl was lazy, that dangerous sound Chaya swore she was going to make sure he never uttered again.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Dayle wheezed and charged again.</p> <p>The blow to his ribs took him to his knees.</p><p>\u201cWe can keep this up all day,\u201d Natches informed him, stepping back as Dayle rolled to his side. \u201cCome on, old man; pull your ass back up. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re bleeding enough.\u201d</p><p>Nadine was sprawled where Alex\u2019s bullet had left her, and as Chaya watched, Alex stepped into the hall from the back and lifted Natches\u2019s sister into his arms. Her eyes met his, and she almost backed up at the emotion in Alex\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been drugged, Alex,\u201d Natches told him, still watching Dayle as he held his ribs and groaned weakly. \u201cGet her to the hospital, now.\u201d</p><p>Alex moved as Timothy barked orders into his radio, calling for a unit to meet Alex on the street for the drive into the hospital.</p><p>Zeke stepped into the house, and he, too, watched as Natches moved farther back from Dayle Mackay.</p> <p>\u201cI think his rib is broken, maybe several of them,\u201d Natches informed them cheerfully as he gripped Chaya\u2019s arm and began to move her back. \u201cTake care of this, boys. We\u2019ll see you in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t leave.\u201d Timothy was nearly hyperventilating now. \u201cYou need to be debriefed. We have fucking red tape to get through and questions that need answering. Get your ass back here, Natches. Agent Dane.\u201d</p><p>Natches turned back to him, stared at him, and Timothy went quiet.</p><p>\u201cYou remember that talk we had last year, Timothy?\u201d Natches asked him.</p><p>Timothy glared back at him.</p><p>\u201cI see you do. Cut the red tape. You have the damned recording if your phone worked. Debrief him.\u201d He shoved his finger in Dayle\u2019s direction. \u201cArrest him, get him the hell out of Somerset and keep him locked up. Because if I have to deal with you one more time, in my town, I might break a promise I made to myself and Chay about no more killing. You don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Timothy.\u201d Chaya stood her ground when Natches would have dragged her out of the house. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your promise to me. I did my part. I expect yours as a Christmas present. As we agreed.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his balding head, squinted at her, then sighed. \u201cBy Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, then turned and let Natches lead her from the house. The street was filled with vehicles. He wrapped his jacket around her, lifted her to the back of the Harley, and seconds later they were maneuvering through the crowd converging on the Grace home.</p><p>It was over. She wrapped her arms around his waist and leaned against his back as they hit the interstate and headed back to the Nauti Dreams.</p><p>\u201cYou promised me at least a week in that bed of yours,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cHow are you going to keep your cousins away from us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my ways.\u201d He turned, flashed her a wicked smile and a wink. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby. I have my ways.\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>Enter At Your Own Risk</p><p>No Knocking</p><p>No Visitors</p><p>GO AWAY</p><p>The sign blocked the entrance to the Nauti Dreams for two weeks. It had gone up a week after Dayle Mackay\u2019s arrest, and Chaya and Natches stayed secluded.</p><p>Rowdy and Dawg shook their heads as they passed by and heard the male laugher, the feminine giggling, from inside. They swore Natches and Chaya were going to starve before they came out, but they both had to admit, the sound of Natches\u2019s laughter from inside that houseboat lightened their hearts.</p><p>Finally, the sign came down though. As October turned into November, and the chill wind turned icy on the lake, Natches stepped from the Dreams.</p><p>Dressed in jeans, zipped only, no shirt, and socked feet, he inhaled the scent of winter coming and wrapped his arms around the real dream in his life as she stood in front of him, bundled in a quilt, drowsy and sated from the early morning loving they had shared.</p><p>Excited by the knowledge they carried.</p><p>Natches had slipped from the boat the night before and made a trip to the pharmacy. This morning Chaya had taken the pregnancy test he had brought home, and it was positive. She was having his child.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to teach him to play baseball then?\u201d she asked, a smile teasing her lips as he kissed the curve of her neck.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he drawled. A silky, rich, lazy sound that she already loved. \u201cAnd if we have a daughter, I swear, Chay, I\u2019m locking her up till she\u2019s fifty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you lock her up, she won\u2019t be able to find a Harley-riding hellion to steal her heart,\u201d she teased, laughing.</p><p>\u201cMy point exactly, sweetheart. My point exactly.\u201d</p><p>Before Chaya could reply, Dawg stepped out of the Nauti Nights, pushed his fingers through his mussed hair, and threw them both an irritated look.</p><p>\u201cTake your mushy crap back behind closed doors,\u201d he grumbled, the scowl on his face boding ill for daring to get in his way.</p><p>Chaya watched him in surprise as Natches arched a brow.</p><p>\u201cProblems, Dawg?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Dawg grunted. \u201cI\u2019m calling her brother; maybe he can force that hardheaded little minx to listen to reason. She sure as hell isn\u2019t listening to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Chaya asked him.</p><p>\u201cShe needs to go to the damned doctor,\u201d he snarled. \u201cThree weeks now and she\u2019s sick more often than not. She\u2019s tired all the damned time, and she refuses to go to the doctor. Just looks at me like she wants to rip my head off or something.\u201d</p><p>Worry strained the thin, tight-lipped expression on his face.</p><p>Chaya grinned and he glared at her. \u201cShe\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s normal.\u201d She rolled her eyes at his look.</p><p>The thought of it still cracked her up. Crista Mackay had been complaining of her ailment the night she, Kelly, and Maria Mackay had been at the boat.</p><p>\u201cThe hell it is. She never gets sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does if she\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Natches tensed, but Dawg froze. He stared back at her, his lips parting, then closing a second before she swore he almost stumbled as he stood still staring at her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s what?\u201d</p><p>Chaya frowned. \u201cI thought she knew. With the morning sickness\u2014she said it wasn\u2019t fair you weren\u2019t sick, too.\u201d She had known, hadn\u2019t she? Chaya asked herself. \u201cDoesn\u2019t she know?\u201d</p><p>Dawg lifted a hand toward the door, and she swore it was shaking. Then he turned back to her and swallowed tightly.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d His voice was almost weak. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Chaya stared back at him in surprise. \u201cSure she\u2019s pregnant?\u201d She laughed. \u201cNo, but Natches bought no less than three of those tests he slipped out last night to get. We won\u2019t need the last two. You\u2019re welcome to them.\u201d</p><p>Dawg\u2019s gaze sharpened. \u201cYou\u2019re . . . ?\u201d He couldn\u2019t seem to say the words.</p><p>\u201cPregnant?\u201d Natches drawled in amusement. \u201cSo the test says.\u201d</p><p>Dawg looked back inside the houseboat, looked to Chaya, then at Natches, and she swore he paled.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she has a girl?\u201d he almost wheezed. \u201cOh hell. A Mackay daughter? Natches, what will we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLock her up till she\u2019s fifty.\u201d Natches laughed as Chaya butted her elbow into his tight stomach. \u201cWe\u2019ll lock them up till they\u2019re fifty, Dawg, because I don\u2019t think I would survive it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA baby?\u201d Dawg shook his head, blinked, then without another word, turned and went back into the houseboat.</p><p>\u201cA dollar says she\u2019s dressed and headed to the doctor in the next hour.\u201d Natches chuckled.</p><p>\u201cTwo says he borrows the test,\u201d she countered.</p><p>An hour later, Dawg barged in, ignoring the fact that the door was closed and drapes were drawn. He even ignored Natches\u2019s curse as he tried to fix the quilt around Chaya\u2019s naked body.</p><p>\u201cI need that damned test.\u201d</p><p>He was definitely pale. And his hands really were shaking.</p><p>\u201cGet up, Natches. This ain\u2019t no time for that crap.\u201d He all but lifted Natches from the couch as Chaya dissolved into laughter. \u201cGet the damned test already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me, Natches,\u201d she called out as he laughed and headed upstairs for the pharmacy bag. Then she looked at Dawg again.</p><p>He was pacing. Dressed in jeans and a dark blue shirt, the ends hanging over his jeans, barefoot and decidedly worried, he paced the living room and stared at the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWish he\u2019d hurry,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Chaya held the quilt tight around her. She knew Crista had miscarried their first child several years ago, something Dawg hadn\u2019t known about until Crista\u2019d returned to Somerset the year before. If Dawg\u2019s demeanor was any indication now, he was terrified. A terrified Nauti Boy. She would have had to see it to believe it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said softly then.</p><p>He turned back to her, his light green eyes pinning her, his expression intense. \u201cDamned right she will be,\u201d he snarled. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure of it. Hurry, Natches,\u201d he yelled. \u201cDamn it, I don\u2019t have all day.\u201d</p><p>Natches was grinning as he came back down the stairs, tossed the bag to his cousin, and watched as Dawg rushed from the houseboat.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll survive it?\u201d He chuckled, returning to the couch and wrapping her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s not a girl,\u201d she snorted. \u201cYou guys deserve girls. A half dozen of them at least.\u201d</p><p>The wounded-male look he gave her had her giggling. \u201cThat\u2019s just wrong, Chay. On so many levels.\u201d He sighed. \u201cA daughter would make me old before my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d She nipped his chin and touched his cheek. He was her nauti dream; she wasn\u2019t going to allow that. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll keep you young.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that and caught her lips in a heated, hungry kiss. Because it was the truth. Loving Chaya would always keep him young. And maybe, just maybe, it would give him the strength to survive if God decided to start laughing at the Nauti Boys and actually gave them daughters.</p><p>Christmas Day</p><p>\u201cNow, you can\u2019t look,\u201d Chaya reminded Natches firmly as he kept his back to the door of the houseboat, his forest green eyes watching her with amusement and love.</p><p>There was nothing she had ever known that had prepared her for the full extent of Natches\u2019s love. He could drive her crazy, make her insane with his arrogance and male dominance, but there was always a smile, always a kiss, and he always held her. It was like nothing she could have imagined.</p><p>\u201cWe could be in bed, cozy and warm,\u201d he suggested, his brows waggling. \u201cWe could try out those new presents I bought you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She blushed. He\u2019d bought her a small cedar box and more vibrators than one woman could use in a lifetime.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d she promised, ducking around him to stare out of the door to where two figures were making their way along the dock to the houseboat.</p><p>She checked Rowdy\u2019s and Dawg\u2019s boats. The men were coming out, their wives with them.</p> <p>Dawg was still in shock that Crista was pregnant and had kept that news from him for over a week before Chaya had unintentionally dropped the bomb. He barely let Crista walk on her own now. The other woman swore it was all she could do to keep him from carrying her every step she needed to make.</p><p>Rowdy wasn\u2019t much better. It seemed all of the women who belonged to the Nauti Boys were pregnant within weeks of one another. And each one of their men would go pale at the mention of having daughters.</p><p>\u201cNow, remember, keep your back turned.\u201d Chaya opened the door, the cold wind swirling in as Dawg, Crista, Rowdy, and Kelly stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cHe looks impatient, Chaya.\u201d Kelly laughed, her gray eyes twinkling as she looked at Natches\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cWhy are they here?\u201d Natches almost turned around, but Chaya was ready for him. She pushed his shoulder back.</p> <p>\u201cStay,\u201d she ordered laughingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a dog,\u201d he grumped. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere are Ray and Maria.\u201d Rowdy opened the door, and Ray stepped inside, beaming.</p><p>The others knew the surprise coming, just as they knew how hard it had been for Timothy to arrange it. But he had come through, just as he had promised he would.</p><p>She looked down the dock again, feeling her hands sweating. They were getting closer.</p><p>\u201cNatches?\u201d She turned to him.</p> <p>\u201cCan I turn around yet?\u201d There was a grin in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She wiped her hands down the sides of her jeans and looked around at the others helplessly. Maybe she had gone about this the wrong way.</p><p>Ray winked at her. \u201cGrandsons are good things to have,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and you get three of them.\u201d Natches laughed. \u201cCome on, Chay. Let me turn around.\u201d</p><p>The other two guests stepped onto the deck of the boat as Chaya slid the door open to let them in.</p><p>Timothy stood beside the young man Natches had been trying so hard to get out of Iraq. Faisal was older now, twenty, but his smile was still bright, if a little nervous.</p><p>He was wearing jeans and a white shirt beneath the leather jacket Chaya had asked Timothy to get him. His eyes glittered with warmth and excitement as he stared around the room at everyone.</p><p>\u201cChaya.\u201d Natches\u2019s voice was a warning now as he felt the tension gathering in the room. \u201cWho\u2019s visiting?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled at Faisal before moving in front of Natches.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she told him, staring up at him. \u201cI\u2019ve loved you forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll love you past forever, baby,\u201d he said shamelessly. \u201cNow what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>She breathed in, then nodded to Faisal.</p><p>His smile lit up the room. \u201cI wish to you, Natchie, a merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Natches froze. His eyes widened, shock spreading over his face as he turned slowly.</p><p>He stared at the young man and saw the boy he remembered. Courage and strength still lined Faisal\u2019s face and filled his eyes, and his smile was still wide, friendly. He was a man now, but Natches saw the boy who had aided Chaya\u2019s rescue in Iraq. The kid who had risked his own life to protect an American.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cranston. He says I\u2019m an American now.\u201d Faisal stared at Natches, that hint of nervousness back. \u201cThat you wanted me here.\u201d</p><p>There was a hint of question in Faisal\u2019s voice when Natches didn\u2019t speak. He couldn\u2019t; his throat was tight, so many emotions tearing through him now. Chaya would have died if this young man hadn\u2019t gotten a message out that she had been captured. She and Natches would have both died if Faisal hadn\u2019t covered them, if he hadn\u2019t helped Natches rescue her.</p><p>There would be no light in his world if it hadn\u2019t been for this boy. No Chaya, no life growing within her. There would have been nothing but the killer he had been slowly turning into.</p><p>Natches blinked back the moisture in his eyes, then moved to the boy. Before he knew his own intentions, he wrapped his arms around the kid and hugged him quickly and tightly before grasping his shoulders and pushing him back.</p><p>\u201cHell, Faisal, you grew up on me, kid,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cWhy the hell did you go and do that?\u201d</p><p>Faisal\u2019s grin was filled with warmth. \u201cTimothy Cranston. He says you have a baby coming. Maybe a little girl that will need a brother such as I. I could be a very good brother, Natchie.\u201d</p><p>A little girl. Natches felt his stomach clench in fear.</p><p>\u201cNah, a boy. You\u2019ll have to help me teach him how to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis I can do.\u201d Faisal nodded, clapping Natches on the shoulder, his nerves receding. \u201cI will do this, Natchie. I . . .\u201d He looked around. \u201cThis is your family that you told me of? Damned Dawg and Fucking Rowdy?\u201d</p><p>Dawg and Rowdy glared at Natches as he cleared his throat. \u201cJust Dawg.\u201d Natches almost laughed as he nodded to his cousin. \u201cHis wife, Crista. Rowdy and his wife, Kelly. And Uncle Ray and Aunt Maria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour uncle Ray, too, son.\u201d Ray stepped forward and shook the boy\u2019s hand before patting him on the back. \u201cWe\u2019re all your family.\u201d</p><p>Faisal\u2019s expression clenched then, emotion working through him as it was through Natches. Hell, Natches\u2019d come to think of Faisal as an adopted cousin, or even a son. He hadn\u2019t imagined the young man he had turned into, but that would work, too.</p><p>\u201cMy family?\u201d Faisal asked, turning back to Natches to be certain. \u201cThey are my family as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdoption papers.\u201d Timothy slapped them into Natches\u2019s hand. \u201cWe began the process when you first started harassing me for it. I\u2019m on suspended leave, I\u2019ll have you know, for pushing this through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor this and several rules he broke in a certain arrest.\u201d Chaya glared at him. \u201cTimothy, you need to settle down and stop making everyone crazy.\u201d</p><p>Timothy\u2019s smile was all teeth. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll move to Somerset. Fine little town. I could have a hell of a lot of fun here.\u201d</p><p>Natches ignored the sniping as he stared at the papers.</p><p>\u201cFaisal Mackay,\u201d he said, looking up at the boy. \u201cThis works for you?\u201d</p><p>Faisal\u2019s smile was filled with excitement. \u201cMackay, it is a good name. Strong. And filled with family.\u201d There was hunger in the boy\u2019s eyes as he stared around the room. The hunger for family, for roots. \u201cIf it pleases you, Natchie, it pleases me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I got a nephew.\u201d Dawg grinned. \u201cHe can work at the lumber store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe marina would be better,\u201d Ray argued. \u201cHe\u2019ll like the lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can make up his own mind.\u201d Natches clasped the boy\u2019s arm and felt Faisal\u2019s fingers curl around his, too, as he grinned down at him. \u201cBut he gets to work in a garage first.\u201d</p><p>Natches turned to Chaya, pulled her to his side, and felt the warmth of family surround him. Even Timothy, the rabid little fucker, was grinning.</p><p>\u201cI hid your presents in the back,\u201d Chaya told Faisal. \u201cBoth of your presents.\u201d She looked to Timothy. \u201cMerry Christmas, Timothy.\u201d</p><p>He scratched his cheek and frowned at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t get you anything.\u201d Out of sorts, that was Timothy, clear to the bone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did.\u201d She smiled softly and looked around the room at the family she had. \u201cYou gave me everything, Timothy.\u201d</p><p>She surprised him with a kiss to his cheek, then moved from the room to the back of the boat, where she had hidden the other presents from Natches. The rest of the family\u2019s were beneath the tree, and now it was time to add to that family.</p><p>She turned back when she reached the hall, a grin touching her lips as the cousins began to argue around Faisal again about where he could work. The young man looked ecstatic, excited, nervous, and filled with hope.</p><p>With hope. That was what they all had now, what Timothy had given to them.</p><p>As the agent turned to her helplessly, she winked at him and smiled before entering the room that held the presents.</p><p>Life was exceptionally good. Natches\u2019s sister would be here within the hour to open presents, then they would move to Dawg\u2019s and Rowdy\u2019s boats, and eventually to Ray and Maria\u2019s for a family dinner and more presents.</p><p>Janey was settling in slowly, finally finding a balance, and Faisal was now safe and where he belonged. With the family that would ensure his future. She and Natches had a life now. Warmth. Family.</p><p>Finally, Chaya had found home. </p> </body></html>"]
