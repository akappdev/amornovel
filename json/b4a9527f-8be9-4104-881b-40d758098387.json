AGAIN. LYING on the soft mattress in Darien Silver\u2019s guest room early that spring evening, Carol Wood tried to sleep. But she felt the growing white sphere begging her to shed her human frailties and run with the magnificent grace of the wolf, strong and agile, with purpose in every stride in the crisp, cold Colorado night air.</p><p>She did not wish to be one of them\u2014at least as far as being a part-time wolf\u2014no matter how much several in the pack had encouraged her to embrace this new side of herself. The moon would soon be whole, but deep down she rebelled against the werewolf\u2019s curse. Because it was a curse to her, just the way her premonitions and psychic touch often were.</p><p>She\u2019d grown up with her revved senses and had realized she couldn\u2019t do anything about that aspect of her life, once she\u2019d learned it wasn\u2019t normal to have the abilities she did. But now to be\u2014she squeezed her eyes tighter and rolled onto her back\u2014a werewolf... No matter how much she wished the truth could be changed, she knew she\u2019d have to deal with it before long.</p> <p>With all her heart, she prayed to keep her newly acquired bizarre condition\u2014shape-shifting\u2014at bay. Her body tingled with heat and her mind with apprehension. Even in the darkness of her half-asleep mind, she fought the change, fought the feeling she was losing control of her physical form. Fresh tension made every nerve ending prickle while she clutched the comforter underneath her chin.</p><p>The heat, like the sun shining on a bright and warm Caribbean afternoon, invaded every pore, signaling the unwanted craving to shift. She moaned, tightening her hold on the comforter, her nails digging into the white eyelet. The moon was growing day by day, just like the damnable desire to shape-shift. No, not desire. Compulsion.</p><p>Then, as if her psychic side finally gained some ground against the wolf, her second sight kicked in. The room and the need to shift dissolved into blackness, and the wolf in her vision appeared again like a lucid dream.</p><p>As big as it was, with massive shoulders, broad muzzle and forehead, and long legs, the wolf had to be a male, standing proud and tall, watching her from the edge of the spring-green forest. Cloaked in rich bluish-silver fur with a lighter mask, and with his ears perked like an alpha male\u2019s would be, he panted until he caught her gaze. His amber eyes focused on hers: the wolf wanted her. Beckoned her to come to him. But not as a human.</p><p>As a wolf.</p> <p>Even in her visions, the scene was one of cajoling, begging her to recognize her destiny, to give in to her wolf\u2019s half. At least that\u2019s the way she viewed him.</p><p>Carol refused the wolf\u2019s alluring gaze and the moon\u2019s sensuous serenade.</p><p>But the moon commanded her! Aroused her to do its bidding through its seductive pull, yanking her abruptly from the vision.</p><p>The heat invading her body intensified now, like a fever that couldn\u2019t be squelched. Never had the shift overtaken a vision in progress. The urge was growing. Yet she knew she still had some influence over the shift, like those born as lupus garous had an inborn ability to prevent humans from catching them during the conversion. Like them, if she wanted to change, the shift happened in a flash. And since she hadn\u2019t just automatically shifted, she must have some control.</p><p>Still, her muscles twitched with need as she shrugged off the comforter and blankets. She lay in her silky gown on the soft mattress in the pack leader\u2019s chilly guest room, ready to yank off her garment before the transformation took over in case she couldn\u2019t stop it. She envisioned the horrifying image of getting hung up in her gown as a wolf. Trapped, snarling, and growling, she\u2019d try to free herself until she woke someone in the household. He or she would find her struggling in a cocoon of silk\u2014furry legs kicking and sharp, wicked canines snapping.</p><p>She gritted her teeth and pressed the palms of her hands flat against the soft mattress, battling the moon\u2019s domination. She would not give up control and shape-shift! Not when she couldn\u2019t rule her paranormal abilities. Not when she would now have to relinquish control over her physical form as well.</p> <p>But more than that, she feared the shift would change her forever. Forever! Doomed to live life as a wolf with the conscience of a human. Even a single moment as a wolf could permanently seal her fate. At least that\u2019s what she thought a new vision was telling her, yet she couldn\u2019t know for certain. That\u2019s why fear consumed her to a greater degree every time the damnable shift threatened to overtake her.</p><p>Cursing her fate, she ground her teeth and clenched her hands into fists, her fingernails biting into the palms of her hands, and attempted to think of anything that would halt the raging need to shift.</p><p>She visualized Lelandi, the pack leader\u2019s mate, throwing a first-ever All Girls\u2019 Night Extravaganza the previous week exclusively for women in the pack\u2014complete with werewolf-romance writer Julia Wildthorn\u2019s latest novel made into a feature film, Wolfly Desires, popcorn, margaritas, and lots of laughter. They were still finding popcorn underneath cushions and beneath the couch in little clusters. Carol smiled at the memory, hoping they could repeat an activity like that soon.</p><p>But then the heat rushed through her body again with a new wave of warning. Every muscle tightened, preparing for the fight. As if she\u2019d called to the gods of psychic phenomena and they\u2019d taken pity on her, her thoughts began to blur, and she knew her psychic sense was trying to take control again.</p><p>Holding her thoughts hostage, the dreamlike image showed an out-of-focus man, dressed in red and white stripes, who had knocked her down and was holding her there. Instantly, her blood cooled, the need to shape-shift withdrawing. A scrap of relief trickled through her. She focused, trying to see the mental picture more clearly, attempting to determine who had tackled her and why. Annoyance was the driving feeling she experienced from the encounter. Not fear. Loss of control, maybe. But the strongest emotion was definitely annoyance.</p><p>The vision grew mistier, the man\u2019s shadowy face becoming hazier and the red and white stripes blurring into pink until they faded completely from her mind. She was in control again\u2014of her thoughts and her physical form.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she rubbed her arms, which were covered in chill bumps. Once more, she\u2019d successfully stopped the change, and she felt some measure of triumph in overcoming the need to shift. She shivered. The compulsion grew stronger every month with each full moon. She could also shape-shift anytime a crescent moon appeared\u2014waxing or waning. Only the royal werewolves, whose roots had not been diluted by strictly human genetics in their recent ancestry, could shape-shift during the phase of the new moon.</p><p>She feared that one of these times she wouldn\u2019t be able to conjure up a vision quickly enough or maybe not at all. The arrival of her visions was as unpredictable as the timing of the craving to shape-shift. But what if she did manage a vision and the shift superseded it again? Worrying about that wouldn\u2019t change a thing.</p> <p>She meant to dream up a fantasy world that would distract her so she could fall asleep again, because she desperately needed the sleep, but her thoughts drew back to the wolf in her vision earlier. He would come for her. Why? She didn\u2019t have a clue. But she knew she couldn\u2019t put off the inevitable.</p><p>Her ragged sleep interrupted, Carol stared at the white eyelet comforter, canopied bed, and antique dressers filling the guest bedroom at Darien Silver\u2019s home and making her feel like a fairy-tale princess. She snorted. Right, like Rapunzel locked away in the tower. Except that Carol had chin-length hair. She had no long golden tresses to toss out the two-story window, allowing her princely rescuer to climb to her room and take her away from her imprisonment.</p><p>She touched the bed beside her where her tabby cat would normally sleep. Poor old Puss. Stuck at the kennel until Carol learned to control this werewolf-shifting business. But for now, her cat was happy, sprawled out on the receptionist\u2019s counter every afternoon greeting customers, even though Carol wanted him home with her. She suspected Darien didn\u2019t worry that her shifting into a wolf would frighten Puss to death as much as he really wasn\u2019t fond of cats.</p><p>She sighed. Darien wasn\u2019t just the owner of the silver mine and the leather-goods factory, nor was he just on the school board, the hospital board, and every other board in Silver Town. He ran the place... as a gray lupus garou pack leader, along with his triplet brothers, Jake and Tom.</p><p>Lelandi, the red wolf, was his mate. And Carol was now a red like her.</p><p>With her skin covered in a light sheen of perspiration, compliments of her continuing night terrors of being attacked and the shifting urge she continued to experience, she rose from the bed and walked toward the room\u2019s sole window. The filmy nightgown she wore caressed her skin with every step, her bare feet pressing silently against the springy golden carpet.</p><p>Not believing how upside down her world had become, she touched the place on her throat where five months ago a feral red werewolf had savagely ripped her open, turning her into one of their kind. No scar existed, not even a trace of one. She sighed deeply. She\u2019d known for some time that a wolf would turn her. Damned psychic visions. But she hadn\u2019t seen how or when or what the ramifications would be. Nor had she realized that the change would force her to take a mate sooner rather than later.</p><p>Once she\u2019d had the vision of what they truly were before she\u2019d been turned, everyone had scrutinized her\u2014Darien, Lelandi, his brothers. And the rest of the pack. They had watched her and made sure she didn\u2019t slip and spill the guarded secrets of the werewolf kind once they realized she knew what they were because of her psychic visions. They had supervised her, barely ever allowing her out of their sight.</p><p>She was still a danger to them. An unknown quantity. A newly turned wolf who could fight the shift, which was an oddity in itself. But something more about her was off. She could see glimpses of the future. And sometimes she could touch an object and gather a psychic impression from it. This bothered them, too. Even Lelandi, who had become like a sister to her, was troubled somewhat by Carol\u2019s paranormal abilities.</p><p>She sighed. She would never truly fit in, never belong. Yet for now, she was stuck under Darien\u2019s thumb, living with him, his mate, and his brothers until he could secure a mate for her. Barbaric! But it was the only way to ensure their safety and hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not that she was going along with it.</p><p>She pulled aside the heavy, pale-blue velvet drapes and the matching silky sheers, her wolf senses allowing her night vision so that she didn\u2019t have to turn on the lamp. She peered into the forest and actually could see, as if the woods were merely cloaked in shadows. Chilling the air further on this cold night, a stiff breeze tugged the branches, making them dance to its tune.</p><p>Then she saw him, the wolf from her visions, stepping lightly out of the woods, watching her, and catching her eye. Her lips parted in surprise, and she took a shuddering breath. Who was he? She still didn\u2019t know all of Darien\u2019s people in their wolf forms. Someone who was guarding the house? Watching that she didn\u2019t leave in a crazy attempt to run away and start her life anew without Darien\u2019s intervention? That would be plain ludicrous. She could never manage on her own, nor did she want to live that way.</p> <p>Because of the wolf\u2019s posture\u2014his ears perked, his head lifting even higher\u2014he had to be an alpha. It wasn\u2019t one of Darien\u2019s brothers. Someone from another pack then? Someone who wanted to fight Darien for leadership? He\u2019d have to battle Darien\u2019s brothers also. Jake and Tom would never allow some outsider to take over the pack.</p><p>The lone wolf\u2019s gaze settled lower, studying the way she was dressed. Could he see well enough from that distance to note that her nipples had grown hard against the silky gown in the chilly air? Observing a wolf and realizing it was probably a werewolf, who would have a man\u2019s desires even in wolf form, seemed surreal.</p><p>His gaze returned to hers.</p><p>Somehow, she was tied inexplicably to him, although the hazy visions weren\u2019t clear enough to tell her how. She didn\u2019t feel any apprehension, nor fear. He was safe, she thought.</p><p>Taking matters in hand, she would find out just who he was and, if she could, why he was here. She yanked the drapes closed, then with as much wolf care as she could manage, she slid a drawer open, hoping not to alert Lelandi, who was sleeping in the master bedroom down the hall.</p> <p>Carol often got herself into trouble because of everyone\u2019s heightened sense of hearing. She kept thinking they could foresee things as she did. Not at all. They were just very good at eavesdropping to spy on what she was up to. Not in a mean way, of course. But to protect her and themselves.</p><p>Intending to find out who the stranger in the wolf coat was, she yanked out a sweater and a pair of jeans and began to dress. If she could get close enough, she would be able to smell and recognize him if she ran into him later in his human form.</p><p>She hated how everyone watched her every move. She felt as though she lived in a glass exam room where everything she did or said was monitored. But what was said behind closed doors rattled her even more. She was one of them, but not.</p><p>Yet\u2014she tilted her chin up a hair as she left her room and then crept down the stairs with the utmost caution\u2014she wasn\u2019t about to lose the person she had been before the change. She smiled as she got to the bottom of the stairs without signaling Lelandi that she was up after retiring to bed early and was planning an adventure she was certain none of them would approve. Now she only had to cross the living room to the back door and hopefully unlock, open, and close it without drawing attention.</p><p>The house was quiet, Lelandi also having retired unusually early to bed. Darien and his brothers were working late at the leather-goods factory as usual, so for once Carol wasn\u2019t being monitored closely. Because she\u2019d been so tired from her nursing shift and unable to sleep when she had the chance, no one expected her to leave her bedroom before daybreak.</p><p>Slowly, she twisted the handle on the door to the back patio. Without anyone\u2019s permission or supervision, she\u2019d be free for a few precious minutes and prove she could manage her own life without disastrous consequences.</p> <p>Disgruntled with himself for slinking through Darien\u2019s forest as a wolf so he could watch the house for any sign of Carol Wood, Chester Ryan McKinley hated his obsession. Even now when his P.I. practice had taken a back burner to his position as mayor and pack leader of Green Valley, he couldn\u2019t give up thinking about Carol, whom he\u2019d met five months earlier while investigating a murder case involving Darien\u2019s pack. Ryan had found a lot of evidence against the murderer, but Carol\u2019s testimony had solicited the confession and the truth of the matter.</p><p>Long-legged and stacked, with hair the color of the golden sun and eyes as deep and mysterious as a shadowed blue lake, she had often worn a troubled expression during the investigation. Most likely due to the mess she\u2019d gotten herself into as a human. The fact she\u2019d managed to get herself into such a predicament bothered him more than he liked to consider. As was his rescuing nature, he\u2019d wanted to save her from her plight, ensure she didn\u2019t become one of his kind, and shield her from what they were.</p><p>But how could he have? She\u2019d recognized his kind were lupus garous through strange visions, or so she had said. There had been no way to change events. During an ensuing fight between gray and red lupus garou packs, a red had bitten her and turned her. Ryan sure the hell wished he\u2019d been protecting her.</p><p>Carol had been an innocent, unprepared for what would happen and unable to fight back. He imagined she\u2019d never before witnessed wolf combat, which for a human had to have been extremely unnerving. Although every ounce of logic he possessed told him that people couldn\u2019t foresee the future, something about her\u2014maybe her sincerity, the fear she\u2019d exhibited, or the notion that she couldn\u2019t have learned all that she had through any other means\u2014chiseled away at his wall of doubt.</p><p>Most of all, he admired her for her fortitude and dependability. She hadn\u2019t panicked or fought against her fate. Now he was sure Darien would be pushing for her to take a mate. For life... that\u2019s how they mated. That she would need one bothered him more than he liked to admit. Those who were born lupus garous could do with or without having a mate. Their choice. But a newly turned lupus garou? Allowing a new werewolf too much freedom was too dangerous.</p><p>The drapes suddenly were thrust aside in the guestroom Lelandi had once used. And there, standing in the window in a diaphanous gown of pale blue silk, the blonde pondered the woods. Almost as if she knew he was there watching for her. Which sent an unexpected surge of feral desire through his bloodstream. What was wrong with him that she had such an effect on him?</p><p>Her appearance in the gown at this early evening hour surprised him. Had she worked a long shift at the hospital?</p><p>The lovely rounded form of her breasts and nipples, peaked in anticipation of a lover\u2019s touch in the nearly see-through gown, became the focus of his attention. Hell. Not intending to enjoy the sight of her as a voyeur would nor to give into his wolfish yearnings, he stepped forward so she could witness she was not alone. He meant to encourage her to close the drapes and return to bed, to warn her that the wolves in these woods were much more than just wolves. They were also men, like any of his kind, with earthly desires that needed to be sated.</p> <p>Instead of closing the curtains, she challenged him with those eyes of hers. What had caught his attention about the woman, even during the investigation, were her classically attractive facial features\u2014the high cheekbones and the perfect skin, framed by golden hair, and the large, striking blue eyes that could swallow a man whole. When she had spoken, full kissable lips had captured his attention more than once. She wasn\u2019t movie-star gorgeous, having instead the wholesome, girl-next-door look, but that appealed to him even more.</p><p>She frowned at him and then yanked the drapes closed. Good. She\u2019d finally come to her senses.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let go of the notion that the nurse thought she had the ability to make psychic predictions. It was the principle of the thing, he told himself. He intended to prove to himself, and to her, that she had come by her information about the murder through means other than some form of sixth sense. Either she had subconsciously learned the truth, or she had meddled in the investigation and was unwilling to tell about it.</p><p>Yet something deeper plagued him about the woman. Some elusive feeling that she could be in trouble. She could be trouble\u2014that was more like it. Any newly turned wolf certainly could be that.</p><p>He tried to tell himself his being here wasn\u2019t about anything other than resolving the doubts that plagued him; although... something else bothered him, and he just couldn\u2019t put his finger on what.</p><p>Ears perked, he sat on his haunches, unable to take his gaze off her window and thinking of her returning to bed and then buried under her blankets. The unsolicited wish that he could be with her, snuggling and heating her up, flashed through his brain. Hell, he didn\u2019t need to be sidetracked anymore than he already was.</p><p>Despite the case having been solved, and him having no real reason to come back to Silver Town, Ryan was attending the spring festival the next morning to learn more about Darien\u2019s celebrations. Like he\u2019d done before, Ryan would take the information back to his own people who wanted something of what Darien and his people had\u2014a town run by the werewolf kind.</p><p>But Darien had only reluctantly allowed Ryan to investigate as an outsider to discover the murderer in the pack. He was sure Darien wouldn\u2019t favor seeing him again under the circumstances, not when Ryan intended to question Carol further about her visions.</p><p>Darien sure wouldn\u2019t approve of Ryan lurking about his woodland estate early in the evening. Especially when Ryan didn\u2019t have one good reason for being near Darien\u2019s house like this, no matter how much he tried to convince himself he did.</p><p>A click on a backdoor lock got Ryan\u2019s attention, and he quickly rose and backed into the woods to keep Darien or his people from seeing him. The door opened. Ryan\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>Little Miss Nightingale stepped out of the house onto the flagstone patio, peering in his direction. Not dressed warmly enough for the out-of-doors this evening, she wore a robin\u2019s egg blue tam that was perched on top of her head, a matching fluffy sweater that caressed her perky round breasts, pale blue jeans that showcased her shapely legs, and a pair of fuzzy blue slippers that made her feet look twice their size.</p><p>He raised his brows. Hell. She had no business coming out into the night looking the way she did\u2014soft and cuddly and vulnerable\u2014with no way to defend herself in the event someone dangerous was lurking about. What had she intended to do? Search for him? Ask him his business? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At first, she stood stock-still, just staring into the woods. At the very place from which he watched her through a grove of Douglas firs. But he didn\u2019t think she could see him.</p><p>And then? She rubbed her hands together as if she were on a wolf-hunting mission and stalked toward the woods, headed straight for him! The notion that she\u2019d hunt him down appealed on a strictly primal level. Her hell-bent determination wreaked havoc with his need to keep this on a purely professional basis. Willful is how he\u2019d describe her actions. What if he\u2019d been bad news?</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t, although right now he had the strongest urge to circle around her through the woods and stalk her right back. A game between wolves. A competition. And more. Which made him wonder if she\u2019d understand their wolf ways, not having grown up learning them. He also was curious just how far she\u2019d go to discover who he was.</p> <p>Instead of tracking her down, he moved deeper into the woods, as if luring her into his trap, and listened to her steady footsteps. They were more hurried now as she tried to reach the forest before he disappeared for good, he figured. Or maybe the fact he wasn\u2019t in plain sight gave her more courage.</p><p>She stopped only a few feet away, the gray-green leaves of a Douglas fir brushing her arm, her eyes searching the dark woods as he watched her. His heart beat harder\u2014the urge to hunt in his blood. Then she lifted her nose in a wolf\u2019s way, trying to catch his scent. Seeing her react the way his kind would\u2014smelling for scents, tilting her head as she listened more carefully, attempting to track him down like a wolf on the hunt\u2014he felt a new wave of respect for her wash over him. He hadn\u2019t seen this side of her before. It suited her.</p><p>Quickly, she turned her head, and when she saw him, her eyes widened. Luminescent. Huge. Bewitching.</p><p>Unable to help himself when he should have been annoyed with her impulsivity at leaving the house without protection, he gave her a slight smile. The woman would be his undoing.</p><p>What now? He wanted to force her to return to the house. On the other hand, he\u2019d probably never get another chance to question her in private like this. He laughed at himself. Yeah, he\u2019d shift, stand here naked in the cold as a human, and question her as if she was a suspect in one of his cases. He\u2019d make such an impressive and frightening inquisitor that she\u2019d quickly spill her story.</p> <p>He took a deep breath and inhaled her feminine scent. Sweet like peaches and jasmine mingled together in a tantalizing combination, it triggered the lingering memory of when he\u2019d managed to get close to her before. But not too close. Darien and his people had made sure of that. It was as if she were a fairy-tale princess in a gilded cage, and only those in Darien and Lelandi\u2019s close inner circle were allowed to draw near.</p><p>A feeling of satisfaction swept through him that he finally had a private audience, although it didn\u2019t do him much good while he was in his wolf form. He didn\u2019t smell any indication that she was fearful, which could have gotten her in trouble if she\u2019d come out here without worrying about his intentions.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked, her brow deeply furrowed as she wrapped her arms tightly around her waist, defensive but firm in her stance.</p><p>He had half a mind to shift. She\u2019d asked a question she knew he couldn\u2019t answer any other way. What would she do then? Run screaming for the house to alert Darien and everyone inside? He\u2019d shock the hell out of the woman, he was certain.</p><p>He swung his head toward the house in his wolf\u2019s way, ordering her to return.</p><p>Determination etched in her brow, she shook her head. \u201cShift. Tell me what you want.\u201d</p> <p>Without his express permission, his jaw dropped again. He couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d order him about. Him, an alpha male and pack leader. She smiled a hint, her eyes narrowing. Devious. Appealing. She didn\u2019t think he\u2019d shift?</p><p>She had asked for it. He stood taller, tail straight out, summoning the urge to change. Her brows lifted a little.</p><p>Heat poured through every blood vessel, spilling through every vein and artery. His muscles stretched, reforming, and then in a flash, he was standing as a man before her. The cold breeze swept across his heated naked skin, and he expected Carol to vamoose or, at the very least, stare him in the eye to avoid looking at his nakedness.</p><p>A whisper of an intake of breath caught his attention, but she quickly recovered and took her fill of him, her gaze drifting all the way down to his bare feet, appraising him in an unhurried manner. He\u2019d never had a woman peruse him in such an arousing way.</p><p>She snapped her gaze back to his face. \u201cYou look nice and healthy to me. I thought maybe you needed medical attention.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when it dawned on him. Miss Nightingale wouldn\u2019t be bothered by his nudity. She was used to seeing naked men. Why did that thought irk him? Maybe not so much that she had seen a lot of nude men, just like their wolf kind would when shifting, but that she didn\u2019t think his maleness was special in any way. Just... healthy. Yet he could have sworn she looked him over in much more than a clinical manner.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cTo the point, Ms. Wood\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCall me Carol. If you\u2019re going to talk to me in the dark forest without a stitch of clothes on, it seems silly to be so formal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChester McKinley. I didn\u2019t recognize your wolf form, but I remember you so gallantly wanting to help Lelandi find her sister\u2019s killer, no matter how much Darien disapproved.\u201d</p><p>The tone Carol used didn\u2019t sound as though she was impressed with Ryan\u2019s gallantry. In fact, she seemed downright irritated to see him. Despite her tone, he couldn\u2019t shake loose of the fascination she held for him.</p><p>\u201cI go by Ryan.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated to speak and then asked, to the point, \u201cSo, Ryan? Why are you here? Does Darien know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I wanted to speak to you about\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lights suddenly flooded the back porch and Jake yelled, \u201cHere! She\u2019s taken off into the woods this way!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>\u201cOH, NO. GO,\u201d CAROL WHISPERED TO RYAN IN THE dark woods, at once sounding vulnerable and desperate. Darien and his brothers were sure to be on the warpath as they searched for her. \u201cIf Darien finds me with you and you\u2019re...\u201d She motioned to his nudity, her gaze lingering lower. \u201cThere\u2019ll be hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll smell me anyway and see my wolf tracks.\u201d Ryan couldn\u2019t pinpoint why he delayed leaving. Maybe he was worried he might have gotten her into trouble because of their actions. Yet, the inexplicable feeling kept gnawing at him that when he had wanted to question her during the investigation and after she\u2019d been injured, Darien hadn\u2019t allowed it. Ryan didn\u2019t like to be thwarted in any fact-finding mission he set out to accomplish. And he wouldn\u2019t be this time, either.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll speak with you at the celebration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarien won\u2019t allow it. You know he won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>At that, Ryan felt a stab of guilt. The only reason he came here was to see Carol and prove she didn\u2019t have any special abilities. For an instant, he thought she sounded hopeful that he wanted to see her about some other matter, something more intimate. Which struck another chord deep inside.</p><p>He had to remind himself that his own wolf pack hadn\u2019t had a newly turned wolf in a couple of decades. So he wasn\u2019t used to the notion that someone like Carol might have difficulty adjusting to pack life where a leader had to ensure the newbie didn\u2019t stray far and cause colossal problems that couldn\u2019t easily be resolved.</p><p>\u201cCarol...\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cGo, now. I\u2019ll try to see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He ground his teeth and listened to the hurried footfalls headed in their direction. Then he shape-shifted and, at a wolf\u2019s loping run, took off for the river to hide his tracks again. Eventually, he\u2019d return to the bed and breakfast and settle in his room for the night. Although he might not be able to keep the room if Darien learned about it.</p><p>He had wanted to face Darien and his people and explain why he had been there tonight, knowing they\u2019d question Carol mercilessly about what she had seen in the woods. Although as a naked man, he\u2019d have had no chance to explain himself, especially when he couldn\u2019t come up with a half-logical reason to explain it to himself.</p><p>\u201cCarol!\u201d Darien said, his tone sharp but worried.</p><p>A pack leader carried the burden of keeping all of his people safe, Ryan knew only too well. He headed toward the river and thought he saw a flash of red fur. Coyote? Another red wolf? He glanced back in the direction he had come. Couldn\u2019t have been Carol, and he doubted it would have been Lelandi.</p><p>Unless it was that sneaky cousin of Lelandi\u2019s, Ural. Or some other member of her family. Why slip around in the dark out here in the woods like he was doing? Ryan\u2019s spine stiffened as he considered what might have happened to Carol if she had encountered whoever this was alone in the dark.</p><p>He had never liked coincidences and rarely believed in them. His P.I. instincts pressed him to investigate the red in the event he could be trouble for Darien\u2019s people.</p><p>With a quick twist in the wolf\u2019s direction, Ryan dashed in hot pursuit after the red.</p><p>The image of Ryan in the nude was still foremost in Carol\u2019s thoughts as he raced off in his wolf form. Although his eyes, pools of darkened amber, were entrancing enough to nearly make her forget anything else. Dark coffee- colored hair curling around his ears had somewhat softened the hard, angular planes of his face, a shadowy stubble adding to the sexy ruggedness. She hadn\u2019t seen him in five months, but that amount of time didn\u2019t diminish the way she had remembered him\u2014the way he had studied her months ago when she explained to Darien what she\u2019d envisioned and helped him bring the murderer to justice.</p><p>Ryan had observed her the same way just now. He seemed to be intrigued with her. Most likely because he\u2019d never met anyone quite like her. At least that\u2019s what she thought.</p><p>But then she was back to thinking about his naked body. Healthy. Right. Sleek hard muscles toned to perfection, darkly pebbled nipples and an indented navel meant for licking, skin glistening, his sex stirring even as she had admired it, jutting out from a bush of dark brown hair, muscular legs, and large feet, all very well proportioned, caught her imagination. She\u2019d definitely not seen him in that way before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had believed that once she had turned into one of their kind, seeing a naked man built like Ryan wouldn\u2019t affect her. She guessed that was a na\u00efve thought. Especially when she had to take a look at his package\u2014 twice. Would it make any difference if she had been a werewolf for eons and had seen others strip and shape-shift whenever in a pack?</p><p>Maybe. Like living at a nudist colony and being used to seeing everyone nude all the time. No big deal. Even though the pack members didn\u2019t shift all the time. So they weren\u2019t often naked in front of other pack members. And they changed so fast that, to the naked eye, the shift was mostly a wondrous blurring of forms.</p><p>She had thought she wouldn\u2019t be affected, being a nurse and trying to look at him in a clinical way while maintaining an air of aloofness. Right. She hadn\u2019t succeeded. Now she couldn\u2019t shake loose the image of his powerful build, thinking how it would be with someone like him in the throes of passionate lovemaking. Her face flushed at the thought.</p> <p>\u201cCarol!\u201d Darien snapped again. She recognized the fear in his expression, although he often schooled his face to hide such emotions.</p><p>He stalked toward her, dark hair, dark eyes, a warrior ready to do battle. His brothers flanked him, all eyes on her, tensions running high, their postures ready to pounce if she attempted to run. Where was she supposed to run to? She was clueless about so many aspects of being a lupus garou.</p><p>Lelandi had warned her how vulnerable she would be on her own as a newly turned lupus garou. But she didn\u2019t want to live alone, either. Despite the pack\u2019s restrictions on her, she still loved the whole lot of them. She loved their protectiveness, their caring, and the way they seemed clueless sometimes as to how to deal with her uniqueness.</p><p>Even so, she thanked God that she hadn\u2019t yet changed into a wolf. But the urge to shift would make it impossible for her to fight it forever. She had no plans to go anywhere. This was home, such as it was, and at least she worked in the hospital, now that she was one of them\u2014kind of. Working as a nurse had been the job she\u2019d dreamed of since she was a girl and had broken her leg. She wanted to help others in need, just like the medical staff had helped her. So this was it for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d she said in a grumpy way, as Darien and his brothers drew closer. She really wished they wouldn\u2019t watch her so much. She was fine and didn\u2019t need them hovering over her like a bunch of old motherly hens. \u201cI thought the three of you were at work.\u201d</p> <p>Jake and Tom looked her over as if to ensure she was okay and then quickly searched the surrounding area, trying to locate Ryan\u2019s tracks.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you left the house? Because you thought I wouldn\u2019t learn of it? \u201d Darien took her arm and escorted her back to the house. He turned to peer over his shoulder at his brothers, took a sniff of the air, and grunted. Towering over her, Darien gave her a hard look.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you doing out here alone with McKinley? Just because my brothers and I weren\u2019t home and Lelandi was sleeping, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe for you to be running around in the woods by yourself at night.\u201d Then he considered her, his eyes narrowing. He shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019d better not want you for a mate.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted in surprise. She should have known Darien would recognize who Ryan was, but why would a gray pack leader be interested in a newly turned red wolf? Then again, why in the world would he want to see her so badly, potentially incurring Darien\u2019s wrath?</p><p>She sighed. Ryan was virile, rugged, and sexy with a body that wouldn\u2019t quit. Hell, he was a feast for impoverished eyes to be sure. She hoped she\u2019d acted less like a schoolgirl who hadn\u2019t seen goods like that on a man in a long time and more like a nurse concerned with his medical needs. But more than his physical good looks, Ryan was protective and caring and dedicated. Was he really interested in getting to know her better?</p><p>She smiled, each step becoming springier as she headed for the house. She\u2019d always had a thing for alpha males. Not that she had any intention of being bossed around, even if one had her best interests at heart. Her fascination with alphas was that they were a challenge. Betas didn\u2019t hold much of an appeal.</p> <p>But then her step slowed. When he\u2019d been here before, she had read in his posture and in his censure that he didn\u2019t believe in her psychic abilities. With that kind of attitude, he couldn\u2019t be interested in her.</p><p>She stiffened and cast a look over her shoulder in the direction he\u2019d gone. So then what was he really doing here?</p><p>Later that night, after not locating the red wolf who had run off in the woods next to Darien\u2019s house, and irritated beyond reason, Ryan came to the conclusion that the lupus garou was wearing some kind of hunter\u2019s scent concealer. Otherwise, Ryan would have caught up to him at some point. Which meant the red was up to no good.</p><p>Sneaking through Darien\u2019s territory, the red had been careful not to mark the area, just as Ryan hadn\u2019t, although the instinct was hard to control as an alpha in wolf form. Ryan had smelled the scent markings made by Darien and other pack members when he had crossed the invisible boundary into Darien\u2019s territory earlier. The markings were a warning to other wolves and predators that the land was already occupied.</p><p>Ryan came across wolf tracks and red fur snagged on a pinyon pine branch, but the smell of the wolf\u2019s current location eluded him. When Ryan sniffed the fur left behind, there was no odor at all.</p><p>He traveled after the red wolf for a couple of miles, but the trail led to a river and stopped on the rocky bank. Even though the trespassing wolf was Darien\u2019s problem, not his own, a nagging thought continued to plague Ryan as he turned and headed through the forest to town. Why had the wolf been watching Darien\u2019s house?</p><p>His actions didn\u2019t make any sense, and Ryan couldn\u2019t help worrying about Lelandi and Carol, the only two red wolves in Darien\u2019s pack. Except for Lelandi\u2019s doctor from her former red pack, who was on loan to Darien\u2019s pack for the time being. But the doctor lived nearer town, not close to Darien\u2019s home. And he was a male. Which made Ryan believe that the red male lurker was interested in Carol or Lelandi. Or both.</p><p>Reluctantly, Ryan followed the tree line and finally reached the back side of the Hastings Bed and Breakfast, where his rented room looked out on the Douglas firs, perfect for privacy. He\u2019d left the window open so he could easily let himself back in. When he jumped at the opening, though, he realized too late that someone had shut the damned thing.</p> <p>His front paws hit the glass pane hard, and he grunted and jumped back. Hell. Swinging his head around, he saw Bertha Hastings, the owner of the establishment, peer out the kitchen window. For a while, she just watched him, not recognizing him. A lone wolf. Not of her pack. An outsider.</p><p>He sat and waited.</p><p>Bertha\u2019s round face lifted in a happy countenance with springy silver curls tracing her cheeks where they\u2019d fallen loose from a bun and a dash of white powder on the tip of her pert nose. Did she finally recognize him? She hadn\u2019t been at the battle when the reds and grays fought. And he hadn\u2019t been in his wolf form at any other time when Bertha had been around.</p><p>She opened the window, lifted her chin, and breathed deeply. Then she smiled again, this time her eyes matching the cheerful greeting.</p><p>She knew it was him. He took a breath of relief as she disappeared from the window. Then the back door opened, and she motioned for him to hurry inside. He hesitated, concerned she might have some human guests about. More vigorously this time, she again waved for him to come in.</p><p>With a loping gait, he hurried into the kitchen. The scent of strawberries and whipped cream, sugar-powdered cakes, roasting duck, and spears of asparagus grilling in olive oil met with his approval. He took another whiff, which made her smile.</p><p>\u201cDinner will be served in a couple of minutes. What are you really doing here, Ryan McKinley?\u201d Bertha asked as she pulled a key off a rack and hurried down the hall, the key clinking on its chain.</p><p>He guessed, as many years as she must have lived, she didn\u2019t believe he was just attending the spring festival the next day as he\u2019d said. He followed close behind her, wanting to slip into the room before a human guest saw him and went into hysterics.</p><p>Bertha unlocked his door and let him in. \u201cI closed the window because heating this place is difficult enough. I didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d taken a run on the wild side. I do have an electronic wolf door in the kitchen if you need to go out. No human guests are staying at the bed and breakfast right now, so feel free to come and go as you please in whichever form you prefer.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d seen the wolf door when he\u2019d first checked in, but he hadn\u2019t wanted Bertha to know he was headed out, figuring she would have been curious about what he was up to. And he hadn\u2019t known if she had any human guests, although that could have changed if one had checked in while he was on his run.</p><p>She motioned to the bedroom with its floral prints in varying shades of green on white backgrounds, dark forest-green walls, white furniture, and a vase filled with fresh green-and-white carnations. The place made him feel as though he was staying in a room in the forest, minus bugs and weather problems.</p><p>\u201cThis is the room Lelandi used when she first arrived. She sure brought a hornet\u2019s nest of trouble with her, although in the end it all turned out for the best,\u201d Bertha said and then raised a brow. She gave a resigned sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t planning on stirring up the town also, are you? I should warn Darien you\u2019re here. But I doubt you\u2019re any real threat. I take it you\u2019re not here to see Lelandi this time.\u201d Then Bertha\u2019s brows both elevated as if she\u2019d worked out the mystery on her own. \u201cOh, not Lelandi. Carol, then?\u201d Her lips curved up in a sly way.</p><p>He waited patiently for Bertha to leave, but she seemed preoccupied with sorting out why he was here and letting him know what conclusions she was drawing from the situation.</p><p>\u201cOh... now I see. I\u2019ll leave you to your business.\u201d She turned to go but stopped and said over her shoulder, \u201cDarien\u2019s getting ready to encourage one of our pack members and Carol to mate. So if you\u2019re interested...\u201d She sighed. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be saying so since you\u2019re not one of our pack, but I think you could handle her best of all since you\u2019re an alpha and patient to boot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe puts on airs that she\u2019s strong and doesn\u2019t need anyone to look after her while she\u2019s supposed to take care of everyone else. Don\u2019t believe it. Under that competent, no-nonsense, skilled nurse is a woman who needs someone for moral support from time to time. Jake would be a good candidate for her, but they quarrel a lot in a lighthearted way. And Tom, well, I\u2019m not sure what he\u2019s thinking half the time. You might want to step in and make a bid for her. I can only say she\u2019d be worth it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled broadly, then closed the door and left Ryan in peace.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like hearing that Jake was quarreling with Carol. After all she\u2019d been through, she needed someone who was supportive and not confrontational. He shifted and threw on his clothes, thinking about what Bertha had said about him being patient. Yeah, he guessed he could be described in that way. Also methodical, dogged, and thorough.</p> <p>But in the market for a mate? He shook his head. All he needed were answers.</p><p>His cell phone rang and he grabbed it. Rosalind. \u201cHello? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see her?\u201d</p><p>No matter how many times he told his sister this was strictly business, he couldn\u2019t convince her. \u201cI plan to see her tomorrow.\u201d At least that was the plan.</p><p>Chapter 3</p> <p>THE NEXT MORNING, APPREHENSIVE AS TO WHETHER Jake or Tom had caught up with Ryan last night, Carol hurried to dress in jeans, her favorite soft violet sweater that always made her feel ready for any adventure, and a pair of tennis shoes. If the brothers had had heated words with Ryan, no one had said a thing about it to her. Which made her worry more that they were hiding the truth from her.</p><p>Sneaking away to see Ryan privately was going to be a real challenge, if Darien and his brothers hadn\u2019t warned him off and Ryan still managed to slip into the festival. Not knowing what to expect at the spring affair, since only werewolves were allowed and she hadn\u2019t been to one before, she had been excited to participate.</p><p>She had barely slept, wondering what Ryan had wanted of her and hoping he hadn\u2019t gotten into a lot of trouble with Darien and his brothers the previous night. Not to mention that twice more the damned hot flashes had invaded her body, an annoying prelude to the shift. Thankfully, she\u2019d been able to stop it both times with a recurring vision of the man in red and white stripes.</p><p>Festive pipe-and-whistle music could be heard playing in the meadow near the woods, and that lifted her spirits. Darien\u2019s pack gathered in the meadow for werewolf-only functions due to its private location, and the music made it sound like a fairy troupe had descended on the area.</p><p>Downstairs, she smelled bacon frying. Had to be Jake. He was always up the earliest and loved to cook.</p><p>Then the aroma of rose and lilac wreaths pelted her senses\u2014the fragrance of spring, well, and summer. The roses and lilacs had arrived, compliments of the local florist shop, while the rest of the flowers were grown in Lelandi\u2019s own garden. Everything from the staircase to the fireplace mantels was decorated in nature\u2019s finest: pine cones, feathers, crocuses, tulips in red, purple, and yellow, and a soft sprinkle of white lights\u2014as if a floral garden had found a warm, cozy niche in a spacious wolves\u2019 den to escape the still cool spring weather.</p> <p>What really enlivened her step was the notion that she would meet with Ryan again and learn why he wanted to see her. Was he interested in her? It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t want a mate; she simply wanted some choice in the matter. So far, she hadn\u2019t been attracted to anyone in the pack except Darien\u2019s brothers, and they weren\u2019t showing any interest back. Maybe the reason she\u2019d had the vision of Ryan was because he was the one meant to sweep her off her feet.</p><p>Or not. Her visions could be irritatingly deceptive, unenlightening, or just plain ominous.</p><p>When she entered the kitchen, Jake\u2019s back was facing her while he turned bacon in a cast-iron skillet. \u201cMorning, Carol,\u201d he said without turning around.</p><p>She lifted her nose and took a whiff of him. He had a spicy scent, a fresh woods smell\u2014as if he\u2019d just been outside and brought in another load of firewood. Even though it had been five months since she was turned, she wasn\u2019t used to everyone using their sense of smell to know she was around. She kept thinking they had psychic abilities like she did, although Lelandi assured her they didn\u2019t. Except for Lelandi\u2019s strange ability to feel her brother Leidolf\u2019s strong emotions.</p><p>Leidolf. He was now a red pack leader in Portland, Oregon, and totally intriguing. He had been single and very available but not interested in a newly turned red. Nope, he was a royal. That meant his lineage could be traced close to the first lupus garou, and very few humans had tainted his family\u2019s line. She would have tainted it big time if he\u2019d ever thought of mating her. But only a couple of days ago, Lelandi had sprung the news on them: it looked like her brother had finally met his match.</p><p>Jake scooped some eggs onto a plate, rousing her from her thoughts about Lelandi\u2019s brother. Jake was an interesting character. He was tough, hiding his emotions, and dark and brooding like his older brother, Darien. But unlike Darien, Jake wore a beard, and his eyes were nearly black. Whenever he had the time, Jake headed into the wilderness, not to hunt or fish or be a macho man, but to take pictures of wildflowers. And he played down the fact he did.</p><p>\u201cEggs, bacon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>No longer did she crave fruit for breakfast. Eggs and bacon were much more her style now. She let out her breath in a heavy sigh, hating all the changes she\u2019d experienced.</p> <p>Jake cast a small smile at her over his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you used to be a vegetarian and have been keeping it secret from us these past few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She didn\u2019t even bother to hide the annoyance in her voice.</p><p>He chuckled. She\u2019d heard him arguing with Darien, that she needed a mate and in a hurry. But Jake wasn\u2019t offering himself. And as sweet as their youngest brother, Tom, was, he didn\u2019t seem interested, either.</p><p>So what did that leave her? A mess of males of various ages, all bachelors, who were dying to locate a female for a mate because females were so rare, or so she\u2019d been told. Sam the bartender was a hunk, but Silva and he were a match, although they were still in the courtship phase of their relationship. Lupus garous did not have casual sex, so that meant the courtship would probably end soon, as hot and heavy as the petting was getting between them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get better.\u201d His tone more serious, Jake set the plate piled with eggs and bacon in front of her. \u201cYou\u2019ll adjust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She didn\u2019t believe she ever would.</p><p>\u201cDarien says you\u2019re fighting the change. Five months.\u201d Jake\u2019s gaze pinned her with the accusation. \u201cCan\u2019t put it off forever, and if you keep trying, it\u2019s bound to get you in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard the lecture before, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you should heed the warning.\u201d He finished his coffee and went back for more. \u201cIf you don\u2019t change, you\u2019ll force Darien\u2019s hand to ban you from working at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>She stifled a gasp. Darien couldn\u2019t take that away from her. Could he?</p><p>Jake cast a sympathetic look at her. \u201cYou won\u2019t have any control over the change pretty soon. All of a sudden, you\u2019ll be ripping off your clothes and turning wolf anywhere at any time. Wouldn\u2019t bother the rest of us, but what would human patients think? We can\u2019t let them know what we are. And you\u2019re a big risk right now.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t allow the shift. She\u2019d felt the urge growing as the full moon approached, but from what Lelandi said, any time the moon was out, even half moon or crescent, lupus garous could change. And they had to at least once during the cycle. Lelandi didn\u2019t have to, being a royal. She could change anytime or not at all. Except for one time: when Lelandi had feared for her brother in his fight to the death with Larissa\u2019s murderer, she hadn\u2019t been able to shift back right away.</p><p>Carol thought that was part of the reason she herself feared if she shifted, she\u2019d be a wolf forever. But the vision she\u2019d had worried her even more. The red doctor from Lelandi\u2019s former pack, Dr. Weber, would shift and then be unable to shift back. At least she thought that was the case.</p><p>Certain Darien and the rest would all shake their heads at her in disbelief, she hadn\u2019t voiced her concern to anyone yet. But she had to. Lelandi was like a sister to her now, and if anyone would believe her, Lelandi would. Or at least Carol hoped she would.</p><p>Sitting across from Carol, Jake smiled. A gleam of mischievousness sparkled in his eyes as he paused, his fork carrying a scoop of eggs to his mouth. \u201cReady for your coming out?\u201d</p><p>She ignored him and poked at her eggs.</p><p>\u201cDarien won\u2019t wait much longer. Not when ten of the men in our pack are insisting he make you available to court.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted for a second, and she couldn\u2019t disguise her surprise quickly enough. Darien hadn\u2019t allowed the men to get close to her? To an extent, she was relieved to think the bachelors hadn\u2019t just been avoiding her because she was such an oddity. And that Darien was concerned enough about her well-being to wait until she was more ready for this.</p><p>But she was incensed that she would be treated like a heroine in some historical romance. Available to court. Right.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Jake. It sounds like medieval times instead of the twenty-first century!\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose in annoyance at the disagreeable thought. Even though she loved reading romances like that, she didn\u2019t want to be treated like one of those women. Although, in the fictional versions, they always eventually ended up living happily ever after.</p><p>\u201cHey, when a shortage of women existed in the Old West, women were prized. You should feel honored. Besides, we\u2019ve told you we base a lot of what we do on age-old traditions. When a good thing works...\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHonored? Ha! All a man wanted then was a woman to darn his socks, cook his meals, and warm his bed.\u201d</p><p>Jake smiled. \u201cNo need to darn socks or cook meals here. Warming beds...\u201d He raised a brow, his smile still lingering. \u201c...that\u2019s another story.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gave him an annoyed look. \u201cI feel pushed into making a decision I don\u2019t want to even consider right now.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his tone an attempt to be reassuring. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be made to do anything right away.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe that for a minute. And \u201cnot right away\u201d meant what? She had days? Weeks? A few months to make a decision? She understood their concern\u2014that she had to be watched constantly, that a wrong move on her part could put them all in jeopardy, and that having a mate would help her adjust more easily to her new role. Still\u2014</p> <p>His chestnut hair lighter than Jake\u2019s and his eyes more amber, Tom sauntered into the kitchen and cleared his throat. \u201cGive it a rest, Jake.\u201d</p><p>Tom was always her knight when she needed one, but even he had kept his distance as far as any kind of emotional attachment since the Thanksgiving feast. She\u2019d wondered if Jake and Tom had only stuck close to her then because Darien had told them to watch her, to keep the other males away from her until he said the timing was right.</p><p>She harrumphed under her breath, and Jake raised his brows. \u201cGot something you want to share?\u201d</p><p>She cast him an irritated look and chomped down on another piece of bacon.</p><p>\u201cMervin\u2019s real interested,\u201d Jake said.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t care that Jake was teasing. She was tired of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cJake.\u201d Tom slanted him a warning look. Being the baby of the triplets, even only by five minutes, Tom couldn\u2019t help that the pecking order was well established. Jake wasn\u2019t about to listen to his younger brother.</p><p>\u201cGet free haircuts if you mated with him,\u201d Jake persisted.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the barber. He doesn\u2019t cut women\u2019s hair.\u201d Carol knew Jake\u2019s comment was intended to ridicule her for having a chin-length haircut and not growing it longer like other lupus garou women. That she wasn\u2019t going to change.</p><p>\u201cA bunch of us are going for a romp through the woods late tonight,\u201d Tom said casually. \u201cDid you want to go with us, Carol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Tom, I\u2019d love to.\u201d Not. Poor Tom. His heart was in the right place; he kept trying to make her feel like one of the pack. But she couldn\u2019t shift. Not willingly. For five months, he\u2019d been trying to encourage her to really join in and be one of them. \u201cBut not tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Jake and Tom shared looks\u2014as if they agreed their houseguest was impossibly difficult to deal with.</p><p>To change the subject to one she wanted to resolve, she asked, \u201cWhen is Puss going to be allowed to come home to me?\u201d</p><p>Even if it wasn\u2019t her home, and even though she stopped to visit him at the kennel every night after work, she wanted her fur ball curled up in her lap at night when she relaxed and read a book or watched TV, or to play with him with a flashlight beam as he tried to capture it, or to run her hand under the covers as he tried to tackle the hidden object. Sure, Doc Mitchell, the vet, let Puss have free reign over the clinic and kennel, but she wanted Puss home with her to cuddle and play with! She\u2019d considered sneaking him home with her, hoping Darien would see how much her cat meant to her.</p><p>Her words met with silence, and then Lelandi and Darien walked in. He had his arm wrapped around her waist, and they both looked perfectly satiated. Carol caught herself before she shook her head, wistfully wishing that she had someone in her life like that. They seemed perfect for each other, even though they had their disagreements. Carol would cheerfully suffer discord with a prospective mate, if she could have the glow that Lelandi had worn ever since taking Darien on.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, everyone,\u201d Lelandi said, giving Carol a big smile. With her long red hair curling over a navy blue velour running set, Lelandi looked ready to compete in the festival games, although Carol had heard that Darien had suspended the tug-of-war competition. He wouldn\u2019t say why, and no one would even speculate, which she thought was odd.</p><p>Casting a cursory glance at Carol, Darien was back to his business look, as usual. \u201cJake, I need you to make arrangements for a gathering tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jake turned his attention to Carol. Great. What now?</p><p>Could they be thinking of having her debut to polite society as if she\u2019d just reached the age of maturity and was eligible to \u201ccourt\u201d like they did in the Regency novels she loved? Some regions still held coming-out parties or balls for groups of well-connected young women. She supposed she was now well connected\u2014if living with Darien and Lelandi was the werewolf equivalent. Yet presenting her to \u201cwerewolf society\u201d at her age seemed preposterous.</p> <p>\u201cDid you have a coming-out?\u201d she asked Lelandi. She\u2019d learned Lelandi\u2019s mother and father had both come from pack-leader families, so she imagined they\u2019d been high in werewolf social circles.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>Carol fidgeted with the napkin in her lap. \u201cBut you mated with Darien,\u201d she said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes. I wasn\u2019t quite in the market for one of my pack members, not when the man of my dreams kept coming to me in my sleep.\u201d Lelandi glanced at Darien, who reached for her hand and squeezed.</p><p>Carol loved how the two of them looked at each other, as if the world stood still while they searched each other\u2019s souls in that powerful moment.</p><p>However, the point she was trying to make seemed to be lost, although she didn\u2019t figure it had any bearing anyway. Darien would have his way in this, no matter what.</p><p>As if reading her mind, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s our way, has been for centuries. Not all find mates this way, of course, but...\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>What was left unsaid was more telling than anything else. Carol sat taller and tried not to frown too much. She had been doing a lot of that lately, and her mother had always said that if Carol continued with it, she\u2019d have wrinkles permanently etched in her forehead. \u201cBut since I\u2019m newly turned, I have no choice, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Lelandi said quickly. \u201cThe choice of who you want to see, date, and mate is up to you. Up to both of you.\u201d She gave Darien a look indicating he\u2019d better agree.</p><p>Jake gave Carol an evil smile. \u201cMervin\u2019s invited, right?\u201d</p><p>If the table leg hadn\u2019t been in the way, Carol would have kicked Jake.</p><p>\u201cSure, if he\u2019s interested.\u201d Darien carried plates to the table for Lelandi and himself, set them down, and then pulled her chair out for her as she brought their mugs of coffee.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s interested, all right. Real interested,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cGuess that means I\u2019m forgoing my romp in the woods tonight,\u201d Tom said with a sigh.</p><p>Avoiding a look at Carol, Darien sat at the table. \u201cNo need to. Jake can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help him out.\u201d Tom gave Jake a look like he\u2019d better behave or else.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t Tom be interested in her? She\u2019d noticed that when Lelandi and Darien were together, or Sam and Silva, she smelled a distinct sexual attraction between them. She hadn\u2019t noticed that special scent whenever any male was near her. Which meant? She guessed no one was that interested. Heck, she hadn\u2019t had a real boyfriend since she\u2019d started nursing school four years ago, and now that she was a werewolf, she couldn\u2019t even excite a bunch of horny wolves who didn\u2019t have mates.</p><p>The way Lelandi was casting surreptitious looks, Carol knew she wanted to speak to her about something out of the guys\u2019 earshot. Probably sisterly wolf advice about meeting with a man alone in the woods. Even if he\u2019d been a wolf. At first.</p><p>Darien quickly devoured his breakfast, kissed Lelandi\u2019s cheek, and then said to his brothers, \u201cCome on. The celebration doesn\u2019t truly start until we show up.\u201d</p><p>She knew that included Lelandi, but... something was being left unsaid.</p><p>Jake and Tom glanced at Carol. Yep, the secret society of wolves, and she really wasn\u2019t part of it. The men hurried to leave while Lelandi began clearing away the dishes. Carol rose to help her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he want, Carol?\u201d Lelandi asked casually, but Carol noted the disapproval in her tone of voice.</p><p>Trying to appear nonchalant, Carol asked, \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi turned and touched Carol\u2019s arm in an appeasing way, her eyes worried. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for you trying to adjust to our ways, but you have to realize Darien only does what\u2019s best for you and for our people.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t wanted you to be changed against your will or to suffer as you did. But I thank God you survived the attack. You\u2019re like a sister to me now, always and forever.\u201d She hugged Carol and breathed in deeply. \u201cAlways know that.\u201d</p><p>A feeling of belonging washed over Carol briefly. She was glad to have a sister when both she and Lelandi had lost their own. She expected Lelandi to say something more about Ryan, to warn her off him, but for whatever reason, Lelandi continued to rinse the coffee mugs and put them in the dishwasher without saying another word. Maybe she figured Carol wouldn\u2019t listen anyway. And she had that right. Carol couldn\u2019t be a beta like most of the people in the pack. Most of the time, she wouldn\u2019t roll over and play the subservient wolf unless she felt she had no other choice.</p><p>The issue of the vision she\u2019d had the day before kept plaguing her. She knew she had to tell Lelandi. Even though the more she considered it, the more she was afraid Lelandi wouldn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>Keeping her hands busy so speaking about the subject would be easier, Carol rinsed off a dirty dish and put it in the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cLelandi... I... well, I know it\u2019s sometimes difficult for others to believe how I can see things that haven\u2019t happened yet. Until they can be proven. I mean, if I give a warning and then whatever I predicted actually occurs. Then it\u2019s perfectly verifiable. I know sometimes you feel that\u2019s true even when the vision hasn\u2019t come to pass, but sometimes...\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>Lelandi set the washrag on the tile counter and stopped wiping off bread crumbs and coffee spills, her expression an attempt at neutral, but her jaw tightened marginally. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Her voice was even but tinged with concern. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s just that I saw Doc shift into a wolf and then, well, he couldn\u2019t shift back.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s brows rose, and then she smiled. Any hint of concern vanished, and she went back to wiping the counter. \u201cHe changes back. We all do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one time you couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Lelandi paused and looked thoughtful. \u201cYes, but that only has to do with my strong feelings for certain people. It\u2019s only happened twice, each time when my brother nearly died. It took a couple of hours, maybe longer, to turn back into my human form. Then I was back to normal. No one that I\u2019ve known during my long years of life has had trouble shifting form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven newly turned wolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see yourself in that predicament? Unable to shift back?\u201d</p><p>Carol slowly shook her head. But she figured the only reason she didn\u2019t see that was because she refused to change and was able to fight it successfully. For how long, she wasn\u2019t certain. She also noted that Lelandi didn\u2019t exactly answer her question. \u201cHave any newly turned wolves that you know of been unable to shape-shift back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019ve ever heard of. Besides, Doc\u2019s a royal red like me. No human influences in his roots for generations. So like me, he can change at will.\u201d Lelandi smiled and patted Carol\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDoc Weber will be fine. You said your visions were brief glimpses of the future. So he shifts, and you just don\u2019t see him change back. He has to shift back eventually, only you don\u2019t see a vision of that. That\u2019s all.</p> <p>\u201cReally, Carol. I\u2019ve explained how I was tied to my sister\u2019s and brother\u2019s stronger emotions whenever we were in close proximity to each other. That\u2019s all the problem was with my inability to shape-shift back. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>But Carol did worry. Lelandi was right that Carol couldn\u2019t see a lengthy video stream of what would occur, but just like Lelandi felt strong ties to her brother\u2019s emotions, Carol had strong feelings with her visions. And she knew something was horribly wrong. It had to be that Doc couldn\u2019t shift back. She couldn\u2019t imagine what else the matter could be.</p><p>She sighed. Until she could see something more that would convince Lelandi, she knew she\u2019d never get anywhere on that front. Might as well talk to Lelandi about what Carol knew was bothering her. \u201cIn the woods last night... Ryan said he had something to ask me. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi stopped rinsing the sink out and turned to gape at Carol. \u201cRyan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, Chester Ryan McKinley, but he asked me to call him Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe changed from a wolf and stood naked in front of you to speak?\u201d</p> <p>Carol shrugged. \u201cIt was no big deal. I\u2019d had a vision of him, and I needed to know who he was and what he wanted. He couldn\u2019t very well answer me as a wolf. And, he was a perfect gentleman, just as he always was with you.\u201d</p><p>Her green eyes narrowed, Lelandi gave a ladylike snort and tucked her red curls behind her ears. \u201cHe was a gentleman with me because he knew he\u2019d be a dead man if he was anything but. Men are wolves, no pun intended. Lusty wolves.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s got any ideas about you\u2014which he very well may have, now that you\u2019re one of us\u2014you\u2019d best stay clear of him. Darien and his brothers will make short work of him if he interferes in pack politics. He\u2019s not here by invitation, and last night he trespassed in our territory without permission. Darien\u2019s quite incensed about it.\u201d</p><p>Her heart sinking, Carol glanced out the kitchen window. She was a healer by trade, and the last time she\u2019d watched out the sunroom windows was when the pack gathered in the meadow to take down a murderer. She couldn\u2019t deal with this part of being a werewolf. Maybe subconsciously that was another thing that bothered her about being a part-time wolf. If she changed, would she have the urge to kill?</p><p>With shaking hands, Carol put the last of the dirty silverware in the dishwasher. \u201cI\u2019ll...I\u2019ll see you at the festival.\u201d</p><p>She rushed out of the kitchen to warn Ryan to leave right away, if she caught sight of him first.</p><p>Lelandi called out to her, \u201cDon\u2019t get in the way of Darien\u2019s handling of our pack, Carol.\u201d</p><p>Right, when she was already an outsider with so many strikes against her, what did another few matter?</p> <p>Why did the men in Darien\u2019s pack still want her? Were they just desperate? She\u2019d seen them smile as if they were interested. She guessed they hadn\u2019t approached her yet because of Darien\u2019s ruling. But still, she was bothered by the niggling thought that they would get a lot more than they bargained for if they pursued her. She didn\u2019t think any of the beta males could deal with her uniqueness.</p><p>She sighed and shoved the sunroom door open.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>LELANDI SMILED AFTER CAROL AS SHE BOLTED OUT OF the house. Lelandi could talk until she was blue in the face, trying to get Darien to listen to her about Carol\u2019s special circumstances, without making a difference. Either Carol\u2019s desire to save Chester\u2019s\u2014rather, Ryan\u2019s\u2014butt would change Jake or Tom\u2019s interest in Carol, or maybe Ryan was her match.</p><p>Whatever Lelandi could do to help, she was ready. She was certain that the right man would work wonders in helping Carol accept what she was now. And time was running out. Soon, Carol would inevitably shape-shift and when it happened, Lelandi prayed that Carol was at home or with their own kind only. Lelandi had convinced Darien to continue to allow Carol to work at the hospital, but he\u2019d nix that before long if Carol didn\u2019t shape-shift soon.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s best friend, Silva, sauntered into the kitchen, bottled water in one hand and a red ribbon in the other. Her dark curls piled on top of her head, she was wearing short shorts, a pair of thigh-high boots, and a short-waisted shirt that showed off her navel. Lelandi swallowed a grin.</p><p>Sam had better get off the fence about making a commitment to Silva, or he was going to have a lot of competition on the playing field today.</p><p>\u201cI heard McKinley sneaked around the grounds last night to see Carol,\u201d Silva said, brows raised.</p><p>Lelandi shrugged.</p><p>Silva grinned. \u201cHe did!\u201d Then she frowned. \u201cOhmigod, the bachelor males will be out for blood if he shows up at the festivities.\u201d Silva leaned over the kitchen sink and looked out the window. \u201cYou should be with her, don\u2019t you think? I mean, both of us. If we chaperone her, McKinley won\u2019t come near, and Darien and his brothers won\u2019t have to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Lelandi. \u201cSo what did happen last night? I heard Carol was in the woods with him. Alone.\u201d</p><p>Not about to tell anyone what Carol had shared with her in confidence, Lelandi sighed. \u201cWhat about Sam? Is he going to protect you in the game of tag?\u201d</p><p>Silva laughed. \u201cHell, if he doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s his problem, not mine.\u201d</p><p>But Lelandi knew Silva wanted Sam, and he truly wanted her. She wasn\u2019t sure how to get them to finally capitulate and become mates. Lelandi rubbed her stomach absently. She thought she\u2019d gotten the two of them going in the right direction.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Silva, let\u2019s have some fun.\u201d And she prayed that fun was all they\u2019d have\u2014and no male battles of wills.</p><p>Carol backed up closer to the woods, where maybe Ryan could sneak out and talk to her while everyone was busy playing tag. But then she saw four men combing the woods. Ryan would never manage to talk with her alone again.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get a ribbon,\u201d Lelandi said, joining her and tugging at her arm to get her to move closer to a group of men and women, mostly men, who were dividing up ribbons. Blue for one team. Red for the other.</p><p>\u201cSmile. The world isn\u2019t going to end. We play games like this all the time, both as wolves and as humans, although not in mixed forms. It\u2019s our nature to show solidarity, teamwork, and cooperation. It\u2019s who we are and how we survive. Besides, Darien\u2019s brothers will protect you from the big, bad wolves.\u201d</p><p>Carol wasn\u2019t worried about the game as much as she was worried about the battle that might ensue if Ryan showed up. And now she felt as though she was a pawn in the scheme of things\u2014the much sought-after conquest of a bunch of mate-hungry bachelors.</p><p>Laughing at herself over that, she told herself she\u2019d believe that when she saw it.</p><p>Lelandi motioned to Sam, Silver Town Tavern\u2019s bartender. \u201cHe\u2019ll watch that the males don\u2019t get too frisky with you.\u201d</p><p>At six-four, Sam was a formidable foe. He stroked his black beard, his dark eyes surveying the crowd, the breeze tugging at his shoulder-length ebony hair. He looked more like a grizzly than a wolf in disguise.</p><p>Carol was actually hoping for a bit of friskiness. Anything to show she was still alive. She didn\u2019t think Sam would watch her as much as he would his waitress. Already, he was eyeing Silva with lustful interest as she joined Carol and Lelandi.</p><p>\u201cAre we ready to play, ladies?\u201d Silva winked at Carol. \u201cRyan McKinley is one determined wolf, so I\u2019m betting he\u2019ll be here. Despite,\u201d Silva said, motioning to the woods, \u201cDarien trying to ensure he doesn\u2019t come that way again.\u201d She waved her red ribbon. \u201cWhat team are you all going to be on?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi waited to say until Carol spoke. Carol let out her breath and took off toward the table. \u201cBlue.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder at Silva. \u201cThen I can steal your tag. Without getting myself into too much trouble.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>Silva laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, sugar. Never doubt yourself.\u201d</p><p>His expression dark, Jake appeared out of nowhere. From the look on his face, Carol figured no one had seen any sign of Ryan yet. Jake headed in her direction, and she assumed that was the end of playing any game. But he gave her a small smile and took a blue ribbon from the ones piled on the table. \u201cI\u2019ll watch your back.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Darien showed up. He saw Jake with Carol and then chose a red tag. Lelandi smiled and then tied a blue tag around her belt at her back. Since Darien was making Carol attend some archaic gathering that evening, she changed her mind about going after Silva\u2019s tag and intended to target his instead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Squeals from the kids\u2014playing the same game but for junior-sized participants in another field\u2014drifted to where Carol was, and then the signal came for the adult game to begin. Tom rushed to get a tag to join Carol\u2019s team. She should have known the two brothers would be her knights again.</p><p>At first, it was a mad race, with everyone running everywhere to grab tags. Some of the more beta bachelor males didn\u2019t look directly at Carol, but she had a sneaking suspicion they\u2019d target her every bit as much as the ones who eyed her with a smile. That\u2019s when Sam joined her, and she gave the bachelors a devious smile. She had a whole team of alpha male bodyguards to watch her back.</p><p>Darien observed Lelandi, who was eyeing him with a challenge. But as soon as he ran for her, she darted to get a tag from one of the bachelor males who went after Carol. Carol forgot about Ryan, about Darien\u2019s desire to have her mated, about the bachelor males\u2019 interest in her. She forgot about the gathering tonight and about shifting. All she thought about was getting Darien\u2019s red ribbon while he attempted to get Lelandi\u2019s blue one.</p> <p>Close enough for her to hear, Jake chuckled and said to his younger brother, \u201cNormally, no one but Lelandi would have the nerve to go after Darien\u2019s tail. Except for you and me when the time is right.\u201d</p><p>Deep down, Carol wanted the pack leader\u2019s ribbon, if only to prove he wasn\u2019t as much in charge of her as he thought.</p><p>She believed she was free to grab his tag when two men appeared in her peripheral vision, heading straight for her. They were not only protecting their teammate, but their pack leader, while also taking the chance to get her tag.</p><p>Like a hefty football player, Sam tackled the one man, landing the guy flat on his back with an \u201coof.\u201d Jake went in for the kill, so to speak, with the other guy. Smiling, Jake winked at Carol in the interim, which gave her the go-ahead to try for Darien\u2019s tag again.</p><p>Lelandi whipped around and danced in front of Darien, keeping him distracted as he tried to get her ribbon so Carol could snag Darien\u2019s.</p> <p>By accident, Carol groped his buttock, her face heating with embarrassment. Then she went for the ribbon prize with one last-ditch effort. And came away with... air.</p><p>Leaning against one of the tables piled high with ribbons, his arms folded across his chest, Ryan McKinley watched Carol glide and shift and dodge the brutes who went after her, her whole body in motion like a swiftly twirling exotic dancer. Exquisite and mesmerizing. He couldn\u2019t recall a time when he\u2019d enjoyed watching a game this much. Normally he preferred playing. Spectator sports were not his thing.</p><p>Carol, not any of the other women playing the game, was the one who captured his imagination. Her cute little ass wiggled in her tight jeans as she leapt back and forth, her hands outstretched and ready to grab Darien\u2019s tag. Her agility, her quickness, and the laughter in her smile and eyes made her a pleasure to watch.</p><p>Her eagerness to go after the real prize, when no one else would dare, made Ryan smile. Too bad he was here just to clear up the matter of this psychic business. Although the mystery business with the red in the woods the previous night was another situation he needed to clear up by letting Darien know about it, if he didn\u2019t already.</p><p>A man tried to reach Carol, shoving at Sam to get by him, and every muscle in Ryan\u2019s body tightened. He fought against dashing out into the playing field to protect her. She already had such a force of bodyguards that she didn\u2019t need him. And he didn\u2019t want to dwell on why that bothered him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t expected her to play the game so enthusiastically. More reserved, a non-participant, maybe. But not as a wildcat going for the gold. And that gold was Darien\u2019s ribbon. She had nerve, or maybe she didn\u2019t realize what taking on the male alpha leader meant. The fact that she doggedly went after him showed real strength of character. Ryan couldn\u2019t help being impressed. Damned impressed.</p> <p>She ducked another man\u2014an eligible bachelor, no doubt\u2014and whipped around, stripping him of his ribbon instead. Already, she had three tucked in the front of her waistband, the vixen.</p><p>Lelandi caught Ryan\u2019s eye, raised her brow, and smiled. At least she wasn\u2019t against his being here. Her gaze shifted to where Carol was maneuvering again around Darien\u2019s backside.</p><p>Silva suddenly noticed Ryan and shook her head. Then a tall man wearing barber\u2019s quartet clothes attempted to approach Carol, but too many others blocked his path. The man danced around like a red-and-white barber\u2019s pole, minus the blue stripe, as he tried to reach her.</p><p>Jake saw Ryan, stopped playing the game, and stalked toward the outsider, his eyes narrowed and his jaw taut. Ryan figured Jake would tell him to leave. But instead, Jake joined him, leaned his backside against the table next to Ryan and then folded his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Jake\u2019s voice was dispassionate, which surprised Ryan, as if Jake had half expected Ryan to show up and didn\u2019t care one way or another.</p><p>But Ryan didn\u2019t take Jake\u2019s tone for complacency. All three of the brothers could easily be provoked if they thought any of their pack members\u2019 welfare was in jeopardy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to finish my report. Couple of details I wanted to clear up with Carol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing more than that?\u201d Jake sounded skeptical and turned his attention back to Carol. \u201cI never expected her to be like this... so spirited. Or to enjoy herself so much. I\u2019m glad to see it finally.\u201d</p> <p>Surprised she\u2019d been unhappy with the pack, considering how cheerful she looked, Ryan frowned. His first thought was that Darien\u2019s pack members weren\u2019t treating her well. He quickly reconsidered, thinking it might have to do with her having been so recently turned.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not content with being one of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s learning to adjust.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t bode well. When Jake didn\u2019t say anything more about the matter, Ryan asked, \u201cWhat are the problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s different in how they handle being turned. Some embrace the changes. Some don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t settle the unease Ryan felt about the situation. \u201cAnd she\u2019s fighting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>Ryan had never considered that Carol might not like being a werewolf, nor that anyone would be unhappy with his or her newfound abilities. Quicker healing properties, the ability to see at night, and heightened senses of smell, sight, and hearing. Increased longevity. Wolf\u2019s stamina. Of course, he\u2019d been born a lupus garou, so it was hard imagining someone dealing with the changes overnight.</p><p>He rubbed his chin and watched her further, seeing the way she really was getting into the game. From his observations of her, he couldn\u2019t visualize her as a woman who was at odds with her werewolf half. She looked like she was having the time of her life. Even last night when she had hunted him down, she had to have appreciated her wolf\u2019s nocturnal vision and enhanced sense of smell, which had helped her to locate him in the dark.</p><p>Carol went after Darien\u2019s ribbon again.</p><p>Ryan smiled at the determination she exhibited and the way Darien appeared not to mind and even seemed amused. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Darien would look so pleased that she\u2019d attempt to best him, even though he appears to be fighting against showing his feelings.\u201d</p><p>Jake laughed. \u201cHe wants to encourage her to be one of us. I believe if anyone else tried for his tag, other than Lelandi, you\u2019d see some real aggression. Not that he\u2019s making it easy for Carol, mind you. It\u2019s not our way. If she grabs his tag, she\u2019ll have to earn it. But it\u2019s been difficult getting her to open up since she was turned. And Darien can\u2019t help but be relieved.\u201d He looked at Ryan. \u201cDid you know that she hasn\u2019t shape-shifted yet?\u201d</p><p>Ryan schooled his look of disbelief. \u201cSomeone who\u2019s newly turned isn\u2019t able to fight the change for that long. Maybe for a couple of weeks at most, plus the time period when the new moon is out and only royals can change. But five months? She must be shifting when no one\u2019s around.\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head and watched her again. \u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn her room at night, then?\u201d Ryan asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t be watching her 24-7.\u201d He folded his arms. \u201cShe\u2019s changing.\u201d No way could a newly turned werewolf possess the inner strength to fight the moon\u2019s strong pull for that long.</p><p>Ryan watched the barber trying to skirt around Tom and a couple of other men on Carol\u2019s team, but the man was unable to make any headway. She deserved someone better than a man who dressed as if he were still living in the past.</p><p>Figuring he\u2019d better address another concern that would interest Darien and his pack, Ryan said to Jake, \u201cWhen I came by the house last night, I discovered a red wolf in the vicinity, male persuasion. He took off running west when he saw me. I tried to locate him to learn who he was and what he was doing in the area, but I lost track of him. Any relation of Lelandi\u2019s? One of her old pack members who might be trouble?\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s expression showed raw disbelief. \u201cWe didn\u2019t catch wind of him. Just you. Trying to conjure up phantoms to explain your reason for skulking around the woods near the house last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cResearch.\u201d Ryan shrugged. \u201cI like to tie up all loose ends before I close a case for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>Ryan gave him a small smile. \u201cA matter Carol can clear up for me.\u201d</p><p>Jake nodded. \u201cYou don\u2019t think she\u2019s psychic. No matter how much we want to believe otherwise, she knew things that should be impossible to know. Trust me on that. I wasn\u2019t sure I accepted her claims right away either, although Darien did. He was concerned that what she had envisioned could get herself and Lelandi killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything can be explained scientifically. She overheard conversations, saw things she wasn\u2019t meant to have seen. But not as a future vision.\u201d Yet, what if she truly had envisioned what she said she had?</p><p>\u201cHave fun proving otherwise. So what happened with the red wolf? Lose him?\u201d Jake\u2019s voice dripped with cynicism. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLike you said, you couldn\u2019t detect his smell. Too many of our kind are beginning to use hunter scents to prevent detection. Which can mean only one thing\u2014 he\u2019s up to no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like you, eh?\u201d</p><p>Ryan smiled broadly and straightened a bit. \u201cFinding the bad guys is my business, whether they\u2019re cheating on their spouses\u2014humans mainly, of course\u2014or perpetuating insurance fraud or some other socially unacceptable deed. It\u2019s my job to expose them. I do happen to be one of the good guys.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on, McKinley. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re not intrigued by the unmated red. She\u2019s unique, interesting, and easy on the eyes. But you\u2019ll never score with her if you don\u2019t believe in her abilities.\u201d</p><p>She was a hell of a lot more than easy on the eyes, and Ryan couldn\u2019t understand why Jake wasn\u2019t interested in having her for a mate. Unless he didn\u2019t want to deal with a woman who supposedly had second sight.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me the truth. What\u2019s keeping you from pursuing her?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>Jake gave a sly smile.</p><p>What the hell did that mean?</p> <p>Chapter 5</p><p>ON THE PLAYING FIELD, ANOTHER BRUISER OF A GUY ON Darien\u2019s team lunged after Carol with a wicked gleam in his eye as she again tried for Darien\u2019s tag. Perseverance had always been a way of life for her. Target what you want, and get it. Although getting a job at the hospital meant becoming a werewolf first, which wasn\u2019t quite what she\u2019d thought she\u2019d have to go through.</p><p>Sam was on his feet, intent on tackling the new threat to her, when Silva distracted him. Smiling, dodging around him, she tried to grab Sam\u2019s ribbon. The bartender grinned at her, but instead of attempting to get her ribbon, he mounted a full frontal assault and tackled Silva in a sexy way. Pinning her to the ground with his body, he nestled between her legs. Forget the tags. Their lips locked together, and they were busy with a new form of entertainment.</p><p>Carol sighed. One guard down. And what a way to go.</p><p>She lunged for Darien\u2019s ribbon. Her fingers latched onto the slip of silk. She tugged, sheer elation boosting her mood, and pulled the tag free.</p><p>In the same instant, Darien jerked Lelandi\u2019s ribbon off and tucked it into his belt with a satisfied wink at Lelandi, who smiled back at him and shook her head.</p> <p>The whole crowd of players\u2014and the older lupus garous cheering on the sidelines\u2014ceased speaking and laughing and stood in shocked silence.</p><p>Carol grinned and, in triumph, raised Darien\u2019s tag, which fluttered in the breeze like a proud flag of honor. \u201cGot one!\u201d</p><p>But not just anyone\u2019s.</p><p>Darien gave her a small smile, looking pleased instead of annoyed that she\u2019d managed to swipe his ribbon. That minor acknowledgment made her feel as though she was standing ten stories high. That, for an instant, he truly accepted her. And that meant everyone else would also. She hoped.</p><p>Everyone began clapping and cheering.</p><p>Darien fondly patted Lelandi\u2019s ribbon in his belt, but then without warning, he dodged after Jake\u2019s ribbon first. His brother, already eyeing him warily, bolted away from him in time, and Darien headed for Tom with an evil glint in his eye, aggressively, no holds barred this time. Carol figured he was leaving her for the bachelor males instead of retaliating and taking her tag.</p><p>She went back to protecting her tail and targeting the guys who were out to get her, never having had so much fun in her life.</p><p>Six tags so far, and...</p> <p>Bang! She was hit, shoved onto her back, taken down by...the red-and-white-striped fiend from her vision. Mervin, the barber?</p><p>He smelled of heavy hair tonics and sweat. She moaned, just thinking what being mated to him would be like. He was the only man in town who wore a costume year-round\u2014a barber quartet type of affair, complete with bowtie, red-and-white-striped sports coat, and dark pants, even for playing a rough-and-tumble game such as this. At some time or another during the game, he\u2019d lost his white straw hat.</p><p>At least while he had her pinned on her back, he couldn\u2019t get to her tail. But then he wasn\u2019t trying very hard to get it either, she belatedly realized. Keeping her pinned beneath him, he seemed to be enjoying another sport just fine.</p><p>She squirmed, trying to unsettle him, but her actions only brought a smile to Mervin\u2019s thin lips. His pale yellow eyes smiled just as brightly. Great.</p><p>Without warning, Mervin flew aside, his eyes wide and mouth gaping. Her rescuer, Ryan McKinley, crouched next to her and rested his hand lightly on her shoulder, his brows knit in a deep frown, his eyes dark as a stormy night.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>The entire playing field grew silent again, and her heart pounded in panic.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThey\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol\u2019s fine,\u201d Darien said, his voice terse as he drew close.</p><p>Darien offered his hand to help her to stand. She grabbed Ryan\u2019s knee instead and started to help herself up. Ryan quickly seized her hand and pulled her to her feet, keeping her close by his side in a protective mode, the heat of his body warming hers, his fingers still holding onto hers in a possessive way.</p><p>But she was more concerned about protecting him!</p><p>Darien gave Ryan a dark look, but not in the least bit cowed, Ryan squeezed Carol\u2019s hand reassuringly and tossed a sly smile to Darien. \u201cGood game.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi quickly stepped forward and waved a handful of ribbons. \u201cBlue team won!\u201d</p><p>Still, everyone waited for Darien to respond, either concerning the game or Ryan, or both. Darien looked at one of his men, who lifted their team\u2019s captured ties, minus Lelandi\u2019s that Darien still had tucked proudly in his belt. His team was definitely short a few.</p><p>Darien gave Lelandi an evil smile. \u201cLelandi\u2019s team won. Let\u2019s eat!\u201d He wrapped his arm around her waist, offered Ryan a warning look, and then nodded to Tom and headed for the house.</p><p>Carol breathed a tentative sigh of relief. As uptight as everyone was when waiting to see how their pack leader dealt with issues, she couldn\u2019t shake loose of the tension tightening her chest. She figured that the pressure wouldn\u2019t go away until Ryan left the area for good.</p><p>Taking his brother\u2019s cue, Tom approached Ryan. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t any of you talk to each other?\u201d Ryan moved his hand to Carol\u2019s back and stroked it once in a reassuring way. \u201cI told Jake I wished to speak to Carol about a matter concerning the murder investigation.\u201d</p><p>Tom\u2019s eyes widened a little. \u201cWhy? The case was solved. All guilty parties were held accountable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a couple of questions concerning... investigative techniques.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s heart sank. That was what this was all about? Or was Ryan just saying so as a cover? He still stood next to her in protective wolf mode, their bodies lightly touching, the heat curling through her. He sure seemed to want something more of her than to question her.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you here last night, skulking around?\u201d Tom asked.</p><p>Ryan didn\u2019t say anything, which made Carol wonder again if he had an agenda he didn\u2019t wish to discuss with anyone else.</p><p>Tom cocked his head to the side, gave Ryan a look that said he didn\u2019t trust him, and then gave a short nod. \u201cAll right, ask your questions of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivately.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Tom hesitated. Then he motioned to the side of the house. \u201cOver there. That\u2019s as private as it\u2019s going to get.\u201d</p><p>People were milling about, most likely interested in what Tom was going to do to Ryan, or what Ryan had in mind to do with Carol. Most of the onlookers were bachelor males, including one particularly sore-looking barber, who was brushing at yellow-green grass stains on his red-and-white-striped coat.</p><p>Ryan took Carol\u2019s arm and led her to the side of the house. His touch was gentle, caring, and protective, and every time he got close, a spark of interest seemed to ignite between them. She looked up at him, expecting... well, hoping he wanted to see more of her. Date her or court her, or whatever werewolves did before they decided they were the right ones for each other and mated for a lifetime. Not that she was ready for a long-term commitment, but a couple of dates would be nice, just to see if he was even her type.</p><p>\u201cCarol...\u201d Ryan released her arm and shoved his hands in his pockets, his head bent to speak more privately with her. \u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t overhear conversations, which is how you came to the conclusions you did and were able to solve the case?\u201d</p><p>Instantly, he stoked her ire. She folded her arms and narrowed her eyes at him. So he truly wasn\u2019t interested in her. \u201cWhat are you inferring?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cDarien and his brothers wouldn\u2019t let me speak with you concerning this matter when I was here before, first, because you had been injured so, and after that...\u201d Ryan shrugged. \u201cThey were being protective, I suppose. But after giving your situation further thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor five months?\u201d Her voice was rife with annoyance, yet she wondered why he\u2019d truly thought about it for that long. Just a rabid need to learn the truth? Or was there more to the story than he was letting on?</p><p>Calmly, he ignored her outburst and continued. \u201cJust that you may seem to have psychic powers or a sixth sense or something, but in truth...\u201d He let his words fade, allowing her to draw her own conclusions, his gaze studying her eyes, observing her reaction. Like a P.I. and former cop would. Most likely jaded. Believing the worst in anyone they thought might have something to hide.</p><p>In truth, what did he believe?</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak but then clamped her lips shut. Hell, ever since her seventh birthday, after nearly drowning in a lake\u2014well, technically she had drowned in the lake, been declared dead, and then revived, she\u2019d had these unwelcome visions She\u2019d thought everyone else did, too, until she mentioned one to her mother.</p><p>She still remembered that day as if it were yesterday. She\u2019d explained how she\u2019d seen a man driving a pickup truck down the street from where they lived and running over one of her classmates. Except that the accident didn\u2019t happen until two days later. And the boy died. Night terrors followed, waking her, and she\u2019d try to catch her breath, tears streaking down her cheeks, her pillow soggy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Horrified and unable to deal with what she\u2019d seen, she finally told her parents. They\u2019d immediately sent her to a special doctor to get rid of her episodes. After three years of visits, he gave up on her, declaring her utterly hopeless. Well... even worse than that. To mollify her parents, he\u2019d said in an appeasing, but not very sincere way that she\u2019d probably grow out of it. The real reason he dropped her as a patient in such a hurry went deeper than that.</p><p>Waiting for her to respond, Ryan cleared his throat and shoved his hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cSorry. You had a question for me?\u201d She tapped her fingers on her folded arm, an insincere smile playing on her lips. He hadn\u2019t asked her a question, but the way he spoke was definitely a ploy to get her to respond to his observations. And she wasn\u2019t biting.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you suppose you might have come by the information you did through some means other than a psychic connection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, sure. That\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s mouth curved up ever so slightly, but she could tell he wasn\u2019t being taken in by her surrender.</p><p>Before she\u2019d become caught up in the werewolf culture, she\u2019d kept her abilities secret. Now that those in this pack knew about her, she really didn\u2019t care if any were skeptical. As long as they didn\u2019t try to tell her that she didn\u2019t have a sixth sense because it wasn\u2019t possible. She supposed that was all because of Dr. Metzger and the way his icy blue eyes would peer through his brass-rimmed glasses at her, while his big chin tilted down, condemning, judging.</p><p>If people didn\u2019t believe her in private, fine. Yet, usually if people confronted her like this, she would smile disingenuously and tell them how right they were. She never felt the need to defend what she could see when others couldn\u2019t, or what she could envision or perceive sometimes when she touched an object.</p> <p>\u201cBut you truly believe otherwise,\u201d Ryan finally said.</p><p>This time her smile was bright and true to her feelings. She couldn\u2019t help liking Ryan, despite his denial of her abilities. He had an easy but determined manner about him, not brusque like Darien or teasing like Jake or afraid to make waves like Tom. His determination was matched only by her own.</p><p>She glanced at the men standing about, including both Tom and Jake. Which made the situation worse. Why couldn\u2019t any of the alpha males show any real interest in her? She was not a beta kind of girl. She supposed that was because her father had become so downtrodden by her mother\u2019s treatment of him. She couldn\u2019t see being married, um, mated to someone like that.</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d Ryan said, his deep baritone voice again yanking her from her faraway thoughts.</p><p>She really needed to get more sleep. She turned her attention back to Ryan. He thought she wasn\u2019t being honest with him about her abilities, when he wasn\u2019t honest about why he had been lurking in the woods last night, watching her window. She didn\u2019t have to be psychic to know something more was going on between them. Time to turn the tables. Throw him off balance.</p><p>Trying to look like this was a perfectly natural way for her to act, she smiled, wrapped her arms around his neck, and leaned into the soft sweater covering his hard body, which instantly reminded her just how hard his body was when he wasn\u2019t wearing a stitch of clothes. She only meant to give him a slow kiss on the mouth, just to prove to him that he had another agenda that he wouldn\u2019t admit to. Or if not, then maybe Tom or Jake would finally show some interest in her. But more than anything, she wanted to get Ryan off the subject of her abilities before she said something in anger that she shouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>To her surprise, he eagerly captured her mouth with his. Not cautiously, building up the desire in slow careful increments, but judiciously, as if he had been starved for affection for a very long time. His hand cupped the back of her head, his free hand drifting lower on her back and holding her in place.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t meant to respond so fully to the kiss either, but his unbridled need fed into hers. Forgetting they had an audience, she parted her lips to accept him, to open an intimate path between them, their tongues dancing, touching, exploring. Her hands fisted in his soft sweater at the back of his neck and held him even tighter. She pressed her body against his hard muscles, and shamelessly she wanted more.</p><p>But then he released her and unwrapped her arms from around his neck, his eyes smoky and dark, his expression otherwise unreadable, his hands still securely holding her wrists. Their breaths came quickly as their hearts thundered at a runner\u2019s pace. He opened his mouth as if he was going to say something, but she didn\u2019t want to hear the apology she figured he would offer or another word about her abilities, if that\u2019s what he had in mind.</p><p>She quickly spoke instead. \u201cI accept. Come pick me up for a date at six o\u2019clock. Promptly.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d show him he wasn\u2019t as much in control of the situation as he might think.</p><p>Then she winked, pulled free, and stalked off toward the house without a backward glance, her blood sizzling with arousal and irritation.</p><p>She harrumphed under her breath. All the idiotic romantic notions she had been harboring for Ryan McKinley... and all he really wanted was for her to confess she wasn\u2019t psychic?</p><p>She doubted Ryan would take her on a date, and she doubted even more that Darien would allow it. But if the date did come to pass, she would get out of the gathering of bachelor males tonight, and she\u2019d give Ryan McKinley a piece of her mind.</p> <p>Ryan stared after Carol as she stalked toward the house, sparing Jake and Tom a smile before disappearing inside. What the hell had just happened?</p><p>Did she think that if she kissed him, he\u2019d forget why he\u2019d come here to see her? Hell, if she had, he hated to admit that for a moment, it had worked. Never had a woman taken him by surprise like that. Never had one heated his blood to volcanic proportions with the way her body had pressed against his, her tongue slipping into his mouth and dancing in an erotic way with his.</p><p>The spark of electricity between them couldn\u2019t be denied. So what had gotten into him to kiss her back? Convention. If he was interested in a woman, he let her know it. But he sure as hell hadn\u2019t planned to go down that path. Not that she wasn\u2019t intriguing as hell, but she sure wouldn\u2019t be interested in someone like him who didn\u2019t believe in her special \u201cabilities.\u201d</p><p>Would she tell him the truth tonight on a date?</p><p>Or would they get themselves into even hotter water if he spent any more time alone with her? He hadn\u2019t even been alone with her.</p><p>He breathed in the air and still smelled her sweet feminine scent, a mixture of jasmine and the fresh grass that she\u2019d been lying in after Mervin knocked her flat on her back. He could still feel the way her body had pressed against him, her breasts and her thighs, soft and curvaceous and sensuous. If he didn\u2019t keep his distance from her, he would forget what he\u2019d come here for. Was that her ploy? Sidetrack him with a siren\u2019s lure and keep her secrets to herself? The vixen.</p><p>All he wanted was to close the file on the murder case in Silver Town permanently. So why didn\u2019t that thought appeal to him? He should have been satisfied to return home and get on with his own business.</p><p>Tom and Jake glowered at him and then headed into the house. Ryan was beginning to think that this case wouldn\u2019t be cleared up easily, particularly if she employed her feminine wiles to tangle with him. Yet a deeper primal urge growled to be released, and he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to keep it leashed\u2014even though Carol was newly turned and probably didn\u2019t understand what she was getting herself into.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Ryan McKinley want?\u201d Lelandi asked Carol, as she fixed a double cheeseburger for herself in the kitchen, where the aroma of seasoned burgers and cheesecake and lemon meringue pie filled the air.</p><p>Everyone else had already taken their food outside or into the dining area or sunroom, and laughter and conversation drifted through the house like the cool breeze through the open kitchen window.</p><p>Carol dished a hamburger onto a bun and topped it with a slice of pickle and tomato. Although she was fuming inside, she smiled at Lelandi.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted a date. Isn\u2019t that nice?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi fumbled with her plate and nearly dropped it. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. Darien will never allow it.\u201d</p><p>Silva, who Carol swore overheard conversations better than any werewolf alive, sauntered into the kitchen. \u201cMy, my... sounds like McKinley is harboring a death wish\u2014or he\u2019s one determined wolf. I heard he kissed you like there was no tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Heard? Or had she seen something out one of the windows?</p><p>Silva chuckled. \u201cYep. The bachelors are ready for a showdown.\u201d</p><p>Eyes wide, Lelandi asked, \u201cHe kissed you and then asked for a date?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s got nerve.\u201d But her tone of voice reflected a trace of approval, and Carol noted a shadow of a smile in Lelandi\u2019s expression.</p><p>Carol almost laughed to think she had been the one to suggest the date, and that if she hadn\u2019t pushed Ryan into proving something to the other guys, he would never have kissed her. How could he not believe her about her psychic abilities after all that had happened? Even Darien\u2019s people believed her.</p><p>In fact, she thought a couple of his people were a little afraid of her because of it. What if someone did something that he or she shouldn\u2019t, and then Carol envisioned it and shared their misdeeds with Darien? At least, that\u2019s what she thought might bother some of them. Beyond that, she really didn\u2019t think Ryan would come tonight.</p><p>Lelandi smiled and lifted her burger. \u201cYou know when Darien told Ryan he didn\u2019t want him interfering in the investigation, Ryan stubbornly refused to take no for an answer.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI doubt he will this time, either.\u201d</p><p>Carol didn\u2019t know that Ryan had been told he couldn\u2019t help with the investigation, just that Darien hadn\u2019t liked the idea. But she couldn\u2019t believe this issue of whether or not she was psychic was such a big deal that he\u2019d butt heads with Darien over it.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the gathering all about?\u201d she asked, figuring that was what she\u2019d have to prepare herself for next. Forget Ryan and his agenda. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be alone with a bunch of men, Carol, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about. I\u2019ll be there with Darien, presiding over the party. Silva will be there and Sam, too, serving refreshments. Two other women are coming from another wolf community. They like what we have here\u2014where wolves run the town and not humans. One\u2019s a librarian who wants to start a library in town. And the other is a masseuse. I think she\u2019s going to be a real hit.\u201d</p><p>All of a sudden, Carol didn\u2019t feel so important. Not that she wanted to mate with someone for life whom she wasn\u2019t interested in... but to compete with a masseuse? Carol probably had the librarian beat. She shook her head at herself. This was still barbaric. And she wasn\u2019t going along with it.</p><p>Lelandi was rattling off a list of names of married couples who were going to attend, but Carol watched the way she rubbed her fingers over her stomach every once in a while, and Carol\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant?\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze riveting from her cheeseburger to Carol, Lelandi\u2019s lips parted for a second, and then she smiled. \u201cFour and a half months.\u201d</p><p>Silva immediately put her hand on Lelandi\u2019s belly. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be. Just how long were you going to hide this little secret from us, sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least until after the games today. If I\u2019d mentioned it before then, Darien wouldn\u2019t have let me play. You know how he is.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s why he was being so careful with her on the playing field and why Lelandi had been napping more lately. He had to have realized Lelandi was pregnant. Carol grinned.</p><p>\u201cWow, this is really a reason to celebrate. Triplets. Just like I had envisioned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know what sex they are?\u201d Silva asked Carol.</p><p>Three boys, but Carol looked at Lelandi to see if she wanted to know.</p><p>Lelandi shook her head. \u201cNo. If you know, don\u2019t tell me. And I don\u2019t want to mention that I\u2019m expecting tonight. This is your coming out. Not the other ladies\u2019 either. They\u2019ve already been introduced to their wolf packs to court. And neither cared for their prospects. So that\u2019s why they\u2019re here.\u201d She took another bite of her burger.</p><p>\u201cThey were born lupus garous, weren\u2019t they?\u201d Carol asked, hoping that at least one of them was newly turned like she was.</p><p>\u201cYes. And, they don\u2019t get along. So I\u2019m hoping one will stay and the other will look elsewhere. I\u2019ve already interviewed them, and both seem pleasant enough by themselves. But there\u2019s some hostility between them, having to do with families, I think.\u201d</p><p>Silva grabbed a plate with chips and a burger. \u201cSo what if a couple of the guys want the women, and they both end up staying here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have problems. Darien has already counseled the men and said that if matches are made, one of the couples will most likely have to move on. But finding a mate is so important that the men are willing.\u201d</p><p>Carol gave a short laugh. \u201cEspecially with a chance at a masseuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Carol. You\u2019re more of a known quantity, one of our own, and no one would have to leave the pack,\u201d Lelandi said.</p><p>\u201cHmm, nothing else, then?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi smiled. \u201cI sure didn\u2019t put that right, did I? The guys have been talking about you. They shut up when I\u2019m around, but they\u2019re intrigued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d Silva waved a potato chip. \u201cAs soon as I hear your name mentioned at the tavern, I check on the table next to them, but the guys see me coming and end the conversation. So, yep, they\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure are. For five months, they\u2019ve been bugging Darien\u2014or his brothers so they would relay the information to Darien\u2014to let them date you,\u201d Lelandi said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been the one to keep them from dating me.\u201d Carol felt relieved in a way. At least she was glad that they had not been avoiding her because they thought her too different.</p> <p>Her green eyes flashing with humor, Lelandi laughed. \u201cNot all my doing. Darien wanted you to adjust to being one of us, and he wants you to shape-shift first. We never thought anyone who was newly turned could prevent the shift for this long, though.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Carol was glad for her psychic abilities, if that was what was keeping her from shifting. She just hoped she could put it off forever, or that her visions of Doc being unable to shift back to human form were a mistake. That the worry about him was something benign.</p><p>But the event tonight was what she had to deal with now. She hoped that Ryan would come for her, that Darien would allow it, and she\u2019d be able to skip the whole affair\u2014even if it meant dealing with Ryan\u2019s inquisition.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>NORTH HAD AVOIDED BEING ANYWHERE NEAR THE TWO women, both gray wolves from another pack and both newly sick from the bioengineered plague that Miller had concocted for them. The lure of money had worked. So from a distance, North observed the way Marilee and Becky looked. Sexy, he thought. Like sending the Trojan horse as a gift to Troy during the Trojan War, the women would attend the gathering and infect as many of Darien\u2019s damn people, and Darien himself, as they could. Payback was hell.</p><p>The only drawback was if Carol got sick. She was the one he wanted. A red, turned by his own cousin. She would be his, and being a nurse, she could counter the effects of the sickness, if Miller was lying about his intentions.</p><p>The women entered the house, and he briefly saw Lelandi smile and motion for them to follow her. Carol could also take care of Lelandi, in the event she got sick. It wasn\u2019t Lelandi\u2019s fault she\u2019d left their red pack. Damn their previous pack leader and his brutish ways.</p><p>North took a deep breath and slunk into the woods. The package had arrived.</p><p>His next mission was grabbing Carol before it was too late.</p><p>Normally, Ryan would dress casually on a fact-finding mission\u2014in jeans and turtleneck or T-shirt, depending on the weather. So why the hell was he dressing up for this \u201caffair?\u201d He scoffed at himself for making such a big deal of this as he peered into the bathroom mirror of his room at the bed and breakfast. He ran his hand over the five-o\u2019clock shadow that gave him more of a wolfish look and considered whether to shave again or not.</p><p>Hell, the first date he ever had, he took the girl to a swimming hole. It was an impromptu situation, and neither cared about what they were wearing\u2014or not wearing as the night wore on. Of course, she\u2019d been human and his and her hormones had been running high. Over the years, he\u2019d been just as spontaneous. He\u2019d take a liking to a human girl, make it known and, if she was of like mind, have a one-night stand.</p><p>But with Carol, he knew deep down it wasn\u2019t the same. That she needed a mate. That one-night stands were out, and although he kept telling himself he had nothing to prove, damn if he couldn\u2019t shake loose of the need to show up the other males, if she was even interested in anyone else.</p><p>He pulled on his sports jacket, hoping to convince Darien that he needed to speak to Carol pronto so he could quit interfering in Darien\u2019s pack business and return home. At least that\u2019s what he told himself.</p><p>As soon as he reached the cozy sitting area for guests at the inn, Bertha Hastings greeted him with a smile and twinkle in her eye. \u201cYour sister, Rosalind, called. Asked if you were all right because you wouldn\u2019t answer your cell phone. I told her you were watching the games earlier and were going to the gathering tonight.</p><p>\u201cShe asked if you were seeing Carol. Since I hadn\u2019t been at the earlier event, I couldn\u2019t say. I did mention you were taking Carol on a date tonight. Your sister was real quiet after that, and then she quickly thanked me and said good-bye. But I must say you\u2019re looking really spiffy. Enjoy the gathering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll be asking Carol a few questions and be on my way.\u201d And have a word with Rosalind again. Hell, by the time he was finished with his business here, Rosalind would have everyone thinking he was chasing after Carol and soon would be mating her.</p><p>\u201cOnly one question is worth asking.\u201d Bertha grinned even broader and made her way to the kitchen. \u201cIf you young folk want something to snack on later, bring her here after your date. Plenty of food for everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be necessary. As soon as he spoke with Carol, he was returning ASAP to Green Valley and the business he should have been conducting.</p><p>Shoulders straight, he stalked outside to his truck and took a deep breath of the chilly night air. He was ready to try to persuade Darien to allow him to see Carol one last time. And to end this obsession he had to set the record straight with Carol.</p><p>When Carol came down from her bedroom before the gathering, men and women were already settling in the sunroom. She was wearing jeans, boots, and a soft pink cardigan, trying to look cool and casual instead of more nervous than she\u2019d like to admit.</p><p>She\u2019d been planning to go to the kitchen for a glass of wine to soothe her nerves when Ryan walked in the front door with Sam and Silva. Carol\u2019s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Ryan was wearing a steel blue sports coat and a pinstriped blue and silver shirt. He had left three of the buttons open from the collar down, giving the appearance he was ready to unfasten the others in a hurry in the call of duty. She couldn\u2019t decide if that meant shape-shifting or sex, but he definitely looked ready for either.</p><p>Jeans gave his look more of a dressy casual, which she totally approved of, but then her gaze riveted to his face to see his expression. A shadow of a beard graced his angular face, roughening it a bit and making him appear more like an outdoorsman than someone who sat around an office all day.</p><p>He was studying her face, just like a wary investigator would, and observing her reaction to his being here. Instead of smiling, he raised a brow as if to say he was here at her request. Let\u2019s get this over with. She couldn\u2019t believe it. But promptly at six, here he was. Maybe Lelandi was right. When Ryan got something in his mind to do, he wouldn\u2019t be stopped. Wouldn\u2019t he be surprised if he stayed around long enough to discover she truly was psychic!</p><p>That could take a really long time, considering that her visions were so unpredictable and that he probably was quite stubborn about refusing to believe in the paranormal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She let out her breath. She assumed Darien would be pissed that Ryan was here. Jake also, because he\u2019d made all the arrangements for the gathering. And because this was her coming-out.</p><p>Darien and his brothers stalked into the foyer to meet Ryan, all of them looking stern and with firm resolve. \u201cYour date will have to wait until after the gathering. Where do you plan to take Carol?\u201d Darien asked.</p><p>Her heart thumped harder. Darien was allowing it?</p> <p>But her second thought was that this was so much like when she was sixteen, going on her first real date with a boy and her dad had read him the riot act first! No riding in vans, on motorcycles, or visiting homes when parents aren\u2019t there. That was the only time her father had acted really alpha. She\u2019d always suspected her mother had counseled him first as to what to say.</p><p>Carol was twenty-six now, for heaven\u2019s sake, and beyond needing fatherly lectures before a date!</p><p>Ryan smiled a little. \u201cThe movies.\u201d</p><p>Darien\u2019s response was terse. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a movie theater here.\u201d</p><p>Ryan had to have known that. Cad. Yet she loved his sense of humor and the way he challenged Darien. Darien\u2019s brothers supported him in just about every situation that arose. None of his people disagreed with Darien. She enjoyed seeing someone who would test him in a lighthearted way.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll grab takeout and return to my room at the inn to watch something on TV then.\u201d Ryan gave Carol an elusive smile and winked.</p><p>Pure macho man and a lady-killer all rolled up in that one faint smile and sexy wink that promised a night of pure heated pleasure. After the way they\u2019d kissed with an audience, being alone in his room didn\u2019t sound like a safe bet at all. She was certain Darien wouldn\u2019t think so, either.</p><p>Every inch of her skin flushed with warmth, and if she hadn\u2019t known any better, she might have worried that the shift was coming. But the heat that signaled the impending transformation went much deeper, Lelandi had explained to her, as if it settled into the marrow of the bones and melted them. And she supposed it did since the bones reshaped into a wolf\u2019s skeletal form or back again into a human\u2019s. What she was experiencing now was more of a surface heat, triggered by pure embarrassment.</p><p>Darien shook his head at Ryan\u2019s suggestion of taking a meal to his room and watching TV there. Darien tried to conceal the expression, but Carol had lived with him long enough to recognize he was fighting a smile. He admired alpha males, and she could tell that while it stuck in his craw that Ryan was an outsider intruding on his pack business, the gray was a challenge. And Darien enjoyed the game when someone had the audacity to oppose him in a non-threatening way from time to time. She wondered if Ryan reminded him of himself.</p><p>In good humor, Ryan folded his arms. \u201cAll right. What do you suggest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tavern. Have a couple of drinks. They\u2019re serving roast beef sandwiches tonight. You can enjoy the music. Best place in town for a date.\u201d</p> <p>Also crowded with tons of pack members ready to observe their every move.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Agreeable, Carol?\u201d Ryan asked, with one raised brow.</p><p>\u201cSure, after the gathering,\u201d she grumbled. So much for getting out of that affair, although she appreciated that Ryan had asked if she was okay with the setup and hadn\u2019t just made the decision without her say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll bring her home by midnight,\u201d Darien added. Then he gave Jake and Tom a look.</p><p>Which meant they\u2019d be Darien\u2019s eyes and ears at the tavern, along with everyone else\u2019s there.</p><p>Darien motioned to the sunroom. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>Carol wished she could have skipped the gathering altogether, dealt with Ryan, and settled this matter in private without delay. But as usual, Darien would have his way.</p><p>Lelandi came out of the kitchen and wrapped her arm around Carol\u2019s waist. \u201cI should have told you earlier that the pack gathering is a throwback from ancient times and that even some humans adopted the notion after they learned our people were doing this. Although they hadn\u2019t a clue what we were. It then became fashionable in England and other locales to present women to society as acceptable to marry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWerewolves started the trend?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi smiled. \u201cYes. Only we stick to our traditions longer than most.\u201d</p><p>Carol envisioned the women\u2019s long gowns and other more restrictive articles of clothing and wondered how in the world they could have removed all those garments if the urge to turn hit them. Living back then would surely have been a disaster for her. For one, she\u2019d have been considered a witch if she\u2019d revealed her paranormal secrets. And a werewolf on top of that? She would have been bonfire kindling for sure.</p><p>She glanced back to see where Ryan was, but he\u2019d vanished. Had Darien or his brothers kicked him out of the house until he could return to pick her up for their date? She shouldn\u2019t have been disappointed that he was gone, considering the reason he wanted to see her further.</p><p>Still, she believed she\u2019d prefer his company to that of the beta males in Darien\u2019s pack. She sighed and asked Lelandi, \u201cAre drinks being served?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi only smiled and guided her into the sunroom.</p><p>The room was bathed in warm lights, with the spring floral decorations giving off the sweetest scent of jasmine and roses. As soon as she walked in, Carol saw the two women from the other pack. Both were stunning, and Carol shriveled a little, feeling plain and unnoticeable. Yet something about the women gave her pause. She was awful about remembering names, but faces, especially as striking as those of the two women, stood out in her mind. She hadn\u2019t met these women, except maybe in passing. But where had she seen them before?</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2019s the black-haired one, the librarian, over there by the leather sofa. And Marilee\u2019s the brunette, the masseuse, next to the fireplace,\u201d Lelandi whispered to Carol.</p><p>Both women looked to see who the new arrival was. Frowning, they didn\u2019t appear pleased, but Carol wondered why they were bothered. Becky was a black-haired and black-eyed beauty, her thick curls cascading over her shoulders. She was sophisticated and sultry looking, particularly wearing a shocking-pink sweater that dipped low at the bodice. Not at all how Carol pictured a librarian looking. The ones at the college where she went? Business suits, glasses, and buns. This babe didn\u2019t look like she read anything literary. Maybe she liked historical romances, too.</p><p>Carol gave her a quick smile. The woman gave her a guarded smile back.</p><p>Marilee was a brunette with the same kind of luxuriously thick hair that caressed her shoulders, dark brown eyes, and a plunging, silky orange neckline that also showed off ample cleavage.</p><p>Both wore black jeans and spiky black heels, and looked dressed to kill. And both towered over Carol by a good four inches. Which made her feel inadequately short\u2014from her bobbed haircut to her petite height\u2014 and not half as sophisticatedly dressed or sexy. She\u2019d describe herself as more casual sporty. Not a siren at all.</p><p>She glanced at Darien and his brothers, expecting someone to make a formal announcement, but no one did. The event appeared to be just a meet-and-greet affair where the guys would eventually garner the courage to speak to the women looking for mates. Although Carol was not in that category willingly.</p><p>None of the men were very alpha, and neither of the two women appeared to be, so no one made an effort to speak to anyone else.</p><p>Lelandi and Darien and the other mated couples talked freely among themselves about general news, but Carol felt that was more of a ploy to set everyone at ease. To make it appear that they were not chaperoning the women.</p><p>Dressed in a fresh red-and-white-striped jacket, no grass stains evident, Mervin walked across the room, headed in her direction, and gave someone a chilling glare. Carol turned to see who. Ryan. Where had he come from? But where he was going bothered her even more. He was headed straight for Marilee. Of course. The sexy masseuse.</p><p>\u201cSorry about earlier today,\u201d Mervin said, getting close\u2014too close\u2014to Carol and pulling her attention away from Ryan.</p><p>If her back hadn\u2019t already been up against a wall in a defensive wallflower mode, she would have stepped away from Mervin.</p><p>A cloying cologne clung to him like a cloud of heavy allspice, when normally their kind didn\u2019t bother with heavy human fragrances.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Thinking of the way he\u2019d pinned her to the ground during the game and wouldn\u2019t let her up, Carol gave him a scornful look.</p><p>\u201cIt was supposed to be a game of tag, not a wrestling match.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t let him get away with believing she thought his behavior acceptable. If she did, she was sure he\u2019d continue to behave that way.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem in the least bit remorseful and glanced at Ryan. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he sees in Marilee.\u201d</p><p>Carol didn\u2019t mean to, but she nearly growled when she spoke. \u201cMaybe he needs a good back rub.\u201d</p><p>Mervin snorted. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be here. This is a gathering for our pack, not for outsiders like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t have any intention of going after any of the women here tonight.\u201d Or maybe he did. What did she know?</p><p>Mervin gave Carol a look like she couldn\u2019t be serious. \u201cHe\u2019s an alpha male. They always go after available women and take their pick. I hear you have a date with him. Break it.\u201d</p><p>A short laugh tumbled from her lips. She doubted he\u2019d say anything like that to Ryan, but he thought he could order her about, and she\u2019d wilt and agree? \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying to make you jealous by talking to Marilee. But we all know you\u2019re the one he wants. Why else would he have sneaked around Darien\u2019s place last night? Why else would he have kissed you the way he did outside the house?\u201d</p><p>She dismissed Mervin\u2019s concern and folded her arms in an annoyed fashion. Not for an instant did she think Ryan was talking to Marilee because he wanted to make Carol jealous. And he had only kissed Carol because he was trying to prove something to Mervin and the others who had been watching their interaction. She still wondered why Ryan had been sneaking around Darien\u2019s house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She considered Ryan, who was standing relaxed and casual with Marilee. The woman\u2019s eyes flashed with intrigue. Her lips curved up in a smile. She might not be an alpha, but she had seduction down to an art. Hell, whatever he was saying to her, he\u2019d sure got her number. She reached over and slid her hands over his shoulders. Instantly, Carol wanted to jerk her hands off him, as if he was hers. Where that unwelcome notion came from, she hadn\u2019t a clue.</p><p>Marilee fluttered her long lashes.</p><p>Which was another of Carol\u2019s shortcomings. Both of the women had thick, long lashes that fluttered beautifully. Carol\u2019s were pale blonde and short. Even with mascara that claimed to make lashes longer and more noticeable, hers were not meant to flicker in a provocative way.</p> <p>The woman was now looking adoringly into Ryan\u2019s eyes, her tongue sweeping over her already shimmering lips, which were coated in dusky pink gloss. If the lout kissed her, the date was off.</p><p>Everyone seemed rabidly entranced with Ryan and Marilee\u2019s actions. Some of the bachelors appeared annoyed, frowns creasing their temples, arms folded or hands shoved in pockets. Some seemed in awe as they watched Ryan, small smiles on their faces. Maybe making mental notes of what worked when attempting to get a woman\u2019s attention?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the tavern and get a drink, Mervin.\u201d Carol had had enough of this fiasco. Even though she\u2019d rather be anywhere with anyone else, at least Mervin had the guts to pursue her.</p><p>Mervin played with his bowtie and looked at Darien.</p><p>Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake. Did he have to get permission from Darien?</p> <p>She headed for the great room, figuring everyone was so intrigued with Ryan and his conquest that no one would notice she\u2019d left. As soon as she exited the sunroom, Mervin hurried after her. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave the gathering. Not without Darien\u2019s permission.\u201d</p><p>Grow some balls, she wanted to say. That was one thing she liked about Ryan. He stood up to Darien, no matter what the circumstances.</p><p>She strode through the great room toward the stairs.</p><p>Mervin hurried after her and roughly seized her arm. She clenched her teeth, her whole body taut with raw irritation.</p><p>Whipping around, she yanked her arm free. \u201cDo not grab me like that again,\u201d she growled low, unable to curb her anger. Partly at being accosted and partly because the masseuse was fawning over Ryan\u2014and he seemed to like it. With Carol, he was strictly business. Psychic business, and what she could do with it, was his only interest in her.</p><p>As soon as the fury at being waylaid had washed over her, heat swept through her, and she cringed. Oh hell... not... the... change.</p> <p>Chapter 7</p><p>RUSHING THROUGH THE GREAT ROOM, CAROL HURRIED off toward the stairs to her bedroom before she did the unthinkable\u2014got naked and shape-shifted in front of Mervin. Heaven forbid! If he grabbed her again, she wouldn\u2019t be responsible for her actions.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave the gathering,\u201d Mervin said, half angrily, half pleading as he stalked after her.</p><p>Without giving him a backward glance, she ran up the stairs two at a time, praying she\u2019d make it to her room and could concentrate on stopping the shift before it caught hold. And that Mervin wouldn\u2019t follow her.</p><p>As if instinct moved her, she tackled the buttons on her sweater before she reached the top of the stairs. Her heart was pounding so hard that the sound of Niagara Falls rushed in her ears, but at least Mervin must have paused at the foot of the stairs and didn\u2019t follow her up them. She imagined if it had been Ryan, he wouldn\u2019t have let her go. Then again, she didn\u2019t think he would have accosted her the way Mervin had, triggering the damnable shift in the first place.</p><p>\u201cCarol!\u201d Lelandi called out from the great room.</p><p>Hell. Carol raced to her room, sweater unbuttoned, her fingers struggling to undo her belt. Now she knew why more of their kind didn\u2019t wear accessories. Or blouses or sweaters with buttons, either.</p><p>She dove into her bedroom, slammed the door, and locked it.</p> <p>Lelandi\u2019s frenzied footsteps grew closer down the carpeted hallway, or at least Carol assumed that\u2019s who was coming after her.</p><p>Carol squeezed her eyes shut and stood still, hoping her second sight wouldn\u2019t fail her now. Anything that would thwart shifting.</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d Lelandi tapped lightly on the door, her voice soothing.</p><p>She tried to ignore Lelandi\u2019s entreaty, the heat still coursing through every muscle, through every vein.</p><p>\u201cCarol, open up so we can talk.\u201d This time Lelandi used a little more force in her words. A command, not a suggestion.</p><p>Go away, Carol wanted to shout. She had to concentrate.</p><p>\u201cDid Mervin upset you? Darien wants to know. And Mervin\u2019s going to be ostracized from the whole pack if he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Lelandi, I\u2019m fine. Just... I\u2019ll be down in a second.\u201d Gritting her teeth, she stripped down to her bra and panties.</p><p>Then the room blurred into oblivion as a window into the future filled her mind.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Carol,\u201d Lelandi said, her voice tinged with dread as she hurriedly motioned for Carol to enter her bedroom. Lelandi wrung her hands as she watched Darien in his wolf form pace back and forth. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. How can we stop this?\u201d Her green eyes turned to Carol, and tears filled them. \u201cHe can\u2019t change back.\u201d</p><p>Darien. First the doc, now their pack leader? But what could Carol do? What could she ever do in a situation initially conjured up in her mind\u2019s eye? It was too late for Darien. Too late for the doc.</p><p>\u201cCarol, you have to do something!\u201d Lelandi pleaded, her voice strained, choked with emotion.</p><p>The feelings of inadequacy swamped Carol, as they often did when she had no control over future events. The fear of what could happen to her increased her resolve never to shift.</p><p>The door lock clicked open, instantly shattering Carol\u2019s vision. Lelandi had to have used a hairpin to unlock the bedroom door, damn it.</p><p>Her lips parted, Lelandi stared at Carol wearing only her peach lace bra and panties. \u201cOh, Carol.\u201d She quickly shut the door as more footsteps tromped their way down the hall. \u201cDon\u2019t fight the change. It\u2019ll only make things worse.\u201d</p><p>How did Lelandi know?</p><p>A knock sounded, heavier, more masculine.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all right,\u201d Lelandi called out in her most assertive way.</p><p>\u201cDid Mervin upset Carol? I\u2019ve got an outsider gray who\u2019s ready to tear him apart, not that I sure as hell won\u2019t take Mervin to task,\u201d Darien growled through the door.</p><p>Lelandi raised her brows at Carol.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d Although she thought Mervin\u2019s grabbing her arm had resulted in the urge to change, he really hadn\u2019t done anything to her to warrant all the fuss. Oh hell, she had to find a way to control the compulsion to shift in case something like this happened again.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d Darien asked, his control slipping.</p><p>Lelandi studied Carol, but she shook her head and frowned again.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Lelandi didn\u2019t look like she believed her. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to you later, honey,\u201d Lelandi said to Darien, \u201cbut she says no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. But I want her returned to the party posthaste.\u201d Darien stomped off.</p><p>Carol was sure he didn\u2019t believe her, either.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to trigger the need to shift?\u201d Lelandi asked in a soothing way, as if Carol was fragile and would break if Lelandi wasn\u2019t gentle.</p><p>Carol clenched her teeth. If there was one thing she wasn\u2019t\u2014fragile was it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t getting ready to shape-shift.\u201d She went to her closet and yanked out a sparkling peach dress with a low neckline and a gored skirt that caressed her legs when she walked. She slipped it on. \u201cI just didn\u2019t feel dressy enough.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi gave her a slight smile. \u201cThe other women are not any real competition, you know. The men are much more intrigued with you, especially after you played so aggressively on the field this afternoon. And taking Darien\u2019s ribbon?\u201d Lelandi gave a bright laugh. \u201cThey loved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone was shocked into silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, all right. At first, sure. But once they saw how good-naturedly Darien took it, they loved how you stood up to him. No one would have dared. Although Silva does from time to time. As to the men, they still don\u2019t know about the other women. You\u2019re more of a known commodity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t like it that I haven\u2019t shifted.\u201d Suddenly a thought occurred to Carol. Why couldn\u2019t she just pretend that she had shifted when she was alone? Then they\u2019d quit worrying about her. \u201cNot that I haven\u2019t shifted when no one is around to see it.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi tilted her head to the side and gave her a look that said: Get real. \u201cI know you haven\u2019t shifted. If Darien learns you were having trouble with it tonight, he\u2019ll want to know what brought it about and how you managed to stop it.\u201d</p><p>Carol was dying to know how Lelandi suspected she had never shifted. Must have been a werewolf thing. She zipped the low-cut back of her dress and slipped into a pair of slinky heels, still feeling underdressed but like she was on a manhunt.</p><p>\u201cI love the dress, Carol. You should wear clothes like that more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought it to go to a party held by one of the student nurses in one of my biology classes. Sat like a wallflower during the whole affair when I discovered the male medical staff in attendance had significant others, who were not at the party, but were looking for some extra nighttime entertainment. I didn\u2019t have a ride home or money to call a cab, so I stuck it out.</p><p>\u201cBut I loved the color.\u201d She ran her hand over the silky fabric. And the cut looked good on her, so she hadn\u2019t had the heart to get rid of the dress. Now she felt way overexposed for the current event, like she was trying to prove something to the other women or to the men, when she had no intention of doing so.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be all right?\u201d Lelandi asked, as Carol disappeared into the adjoining bathroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carol touched up her lips with a shimmering peach gloss. \u201cYep, as right as can be.\u201d Under the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cWhen you went into the woods with Ryan last night, did you see any sign of a red wolf?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Carol walked out of the bathroom. \u201cNo, why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you had any premonitions that we\u2019ve had trouble with a red wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lelandi\u2019s worried voice concerned Carol. What was up now?</p><p>Lelandi crossed the room to the door and opened it. \u201cRyan claims the wolf was skulking around the woods surrounding our home. Since there are only the two of us reds here, other than Doc...\u201d Lelandi shrugged, but Carol could tell she was trying to hide her apprehension.</p><p>\u201cWould it have been your cousin, Ural?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I called him, and he\u2019s still in my uncle\u2019s pack. Whoever it was, he was wearing some kind of hunter\u2019s spray,\u201d Lelandi said.</p> <p>If it wasn\u2019t Ural, was it someone else from Lelandi\u2019s old pack? Someone who had survived the battle?</p><p>Carol opened her mouth to speak, but remembering how those who had attempted to kill Lelandi had worn hunter concealment sprays brought back a horrible flash of memory. She clamped her lips and eyes shut, the terror of the night she\u2019d been bitten coming back to her in an instant. The red wolf\u2019s wicked canines primed to bite her, lips curled back, nose wrinkled, the growl, the sharp teeth sinking in, the stabbing pain, the numbing cold, and then blackness.</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d</p><p>Attempting to hide a shudder, Carol opened her eyes and gave a wan smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing bitten.\u201d</p> <p>Lelandi gave her a heartfelt hug and then pulled her to the door and into the hallway. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. But Deputy Peter Jorgenson killed the wolf that bit you.\u201d</p><p>A deep frown marred Lelandi\u2019s forehead, and Carol got the impression she knew something else. \u201cWas there someone from your old pack who was at the battle and survived?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi stopped halfway down the hall and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cConnor. Darien killed his twin brother. Connor appeared harmless enough to the others when he quit fighting to watch Darien battle with my former pack leader, so they let him go. But later, we had word that during the battle another was downstairs called North, cousin of the one who bit you. Like Connor, he gave up the fight and Jake let him leave.\u201d</p><p>A chill spiked up Carol\u2019s spine. \u201cWould either of them want revenge for their kin\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>But the way Lelandi said it as she headed down the stairs sounded more like she thought the red had some other agenda.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s another possibility?\u201d</p> <p>Lelandi looked over her shoulder at Carol, her expression worried. \u201cConnor\u2019s brother turned you, but he died. Now either of the men, the brother or the cousin, might want to claim you, partly because you\u2019re a red and partly because in the old days when a man needed a woman, and sometimes a woman wanted a particular man, they bit and changed them. Then they took the newly turned werewolf as a mate.</p><p>\u201cIn this case, their kin changed you, but you still don\u2019t have a mate, so Connor or North may feel you belong to the family. But also, they might want you for revenge. Of course, I\u2019m just guessing here. I have no idea if any of this is true.\u201d</p><p>Carol swallowed hard as uneasiness swept over her.</p><p>\u201cAnother possibility is that it\u2019s just a red wolf who smelled you or me in a gray territory and was curious about the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlikely, right?\u201d Carol asked. Just the inflection in Lelandi\u2019s voice told her Lelandi didn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. The whole area is filled with gray lupus garous, which should be enough of a deterrent.\u201d Lelandi clasped Carol\u2019s hand and squeezed reassuringly. \u201cDarien\u2019s put out the word you\u2019re to have a bodyguard at all times. The bachelor males have all eagerly signed up to take turns.\u201d</p><p>How could things get any worse?</p><p>Carol hesitated at the bottom of the stairs. Returning to the sunroom after her flight from the great room was a major feat. She wasn\u2019t shy, but she wasn\u2019t a stage personality, either. She was sure she would be the center of attention when she returned, while she would have much rather blended in.</p><p>When they entered the great room, all eyes were upon them. Brows and lips lifted as the bachelors\u2019 interest was piqued by the sight of Carol in the dress. Ryan seemed to be grilling Mervin in a corner of the room, the poor barber\u2019s back to the wall and Ryan nearly nose to nose with him. Ryan\u2019s jaw dropped when he caught sight of Carol out of the corner of his eye, his fearsome expression instantly vaporizing. Now she wished she hadn\u2019t changed out of her more casual, conservative clothing to something that really got the guys\u2019 attention.</p><p>She stiffened her back and glanced at the two women, who were staring at her and exchanging words with one another, both of them giving her a chilly look. Hell, Carol wasn\u2019t going to be a wallflower any longer. The guys were single, and while she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d really get interested enough in any of them to mate, she had to remind herself that if she just got to know one of them, she might find he truly was someone she could care for. Still for now, all she intended to do was have fun.</p><p>\u201cCan we have some music?\u201d she whispered to Lelandi.</p><p>Lelandi smiled back. \u201cSilva, want to get the music going? Let\u2019s dance!\u201d</p><p>That was all it took. One of the men hurried forth to grab Carol\u2019s arm, and she tried to tell herself she wanted this\u2014Do not shift!</p><p>When he grasped her arm, she took a deep calming breath and concentrated on his flyaway dark brown hair and intense air, his chocolate suit and matching tie at odds with his wild look, and attempted not to think of the force of his enthusiastic touch, which might trigger the shift.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Christian, and I couldn\u2019t have been more proud of you for stealing Darien\u2019s ribbon during the game today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d she said, holding him at arm\u2019s length as he moved her across the tile floor to dance. His darkened eyes looked at her as if he was fascinated with her, but his voice was a little too high pitched to make her feel anything serious about him. \u201cEveryone seemed shocked into silence.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOnly until we saw how Darien would take it. I realize you don\u2019t understand everything about pack politics yet, but Darien\u2019s the pack leader so what he says is the law. Not that we don\u2019t disagree with him sometimes, but we keep it to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Betas. \u201cAnd Lelandi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the pack leader\u2019s mate, so sure, she has a lot of say. But ultimately, it falls on Darien\u2019s shoulders to make sure that everyone follows the rules. His brothers help to enforce them also. So when someone does something that\u2019s contrary to those guidelines, there\u2019s a wait-and-see attitude. Does Darien find it acceptable or not? You might not think so, but the way he\u2019s taken you into his household means you\u2019re his ward, and no one wants to do anything to upset him concerning you.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cDarien is protective. I\u2019ll give him that. But he\u2019s more annoyed with me than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re fighting the shift. It sets you apart from the rest of us, but worse than that, one of these days you won\u2019t be able to control it. And you\u2019ll put us all in a bind.\u201d</p><p>Not liking the way he frowned at her and the sudden edge to his voice, she meant to pull away, but Christian tightened his hold. She was afraid that if she fought him, she might trigger the compulsion to shift again.</p><p>She could see it now\u2014pulling her dress straps down, exposing her bra, yanking her dress the rest of the way off as fast as she could. Then before she knew it, she\u2019d be standing naked in front of a crowd that was shocked or amused or interested. Definitely the entertainment for the night. And the talk for years of Carol\u2019s coming out. She stifled a laugh. Yeah, coming out, all right.</p><p>Christian didn\u2019t seem to notice the tension in her body and continued to speak as if he hadn\u2019t upset her. \u201cI\u2019m your first bodyguard. And I\u2019ll take the job seriously. Anyone who tries to get to you will have to deal with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone?\u201d she asked, curious if this meant he didn\u2019t intend to let any of the other bachelors get close to her, either.</p><p>\u201cAny red males,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019d keep any male away, but not for that reason. Darien has sent some of the mated males out into the woods again tonight, looking for him. He won\u2019t get a chance to get near you. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Not wanting to think about being stalked, Carol switched topics. \u201cWhat do you think of Marilee and Becky?\u201d</p><p>Christian glanced at Becky, who was dancing with Mervin. Carol almost laughed when she saw them together. Becky was keeping her distance, and Mervin was watching Carol. Another bachelor clung to Marilee.</p><p>His expression fierce, Ryan was standing alone, arms crossed, watching Carol. She wondered why he looked so angry, so dangerous. Maybe because he was irritated that another bachelor male had stolen Marilee from him.</p><p>\u201cCute girls,\u201d Christian said. \u201cThey\u2019ll make some guys good mates.\u201d</p><p>Cute girls? Sexy as all get out maybe, but cute? Not in this lifetime.</p><p>What she really wanted to hear was that Christian didn\u2019t think the women were worthy of consideration. Not that she was interested in him, especially the way he\u2019d come across concerning her fighting the shift, but...</p><p>The music ended, and before he could dance with her again, Tom butted in. \u201cMind, Christian?\u201d</p><p>Even if Christian had minded, and she was sure he did by the disgruntled look on his face, Darien\u2019s brothers had priority as sub-leaders in having their wishes met.</p><p>His mouth curved down, Christian bowed politely and then stepped away. She couldn\u2019t believe Tom had even asked her. He kept her separated from his body, very dignified, very respectful, but when he spoke, she knew Darien had prompted him to dance with her.</p><p>\u201cDid Mervin upset you in any way?\u201d Tom began. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She loved the way he was always protective of her. She wished he felt something romantic for her, but she assumed his feelings were more brotherly love for a sister who needed protection. \u201cNo, Tom. I just decided to change clothes.\u201d</p><p>Tom glanced down at her dress and smiled. \u201cA different look for you. That\u2019s what the guys like so much about you. You\u2019re so... unpredictable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt also bothers them.\u201d</p> <p>Tom, being the typical peacemaker, immediately changed the subject. \u201cDid you see any red in the woods when you talked to McKinley there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Lelandi already asked.\u201d She was surprised Lelandi wouldn\u2019t have already told Darien and his brothers.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Carol frowned up at Tom. \u201cI said I didn\u2019t see anyone. Just Ryan. Why do you think I would lie?\u201d</p><p>Tom cleared his throat, his cheeks faintly flushing. \u201cDarien\u2019s just... well, worried you\u2019d had contact with a red male from another pack. Believe me, Darien wants the best for you. If there is something you\u2019re not telling us... we don\u2019t want to kill someone we think is stalking you when he\u2019s truly a love interest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTom,\u201d Carol said, unable to hide her exasperation, \u201cif someone\u2019s stalking me, I haven\u2019t encouraged it. First of all, none of you let me out of your sight long enough for me to have contact with anyone else. And second, if by some miracle I did have an encounter with someone outside the pack, don\u2019t you think that if I liked him, I\u2019d tell you so you wouldn\u2019t terminate him?\u201d</p><p>Tom didn\u2019t say anything right away, and as the music stopped, he glided to a halt. \u201cNo. I think you\u2019d be afraid to tell Darien if you were interested in leaving the pack. Look at what happened last night. You were with McKinley alone in the dark woods. Not a word to any of us. We didn\u2019t learn of it until we arrived home and Jake checked on you, finding your bedroom door wide open and no sign of you in the house. I found the back door unlocked, and you\u2019d taken off into the forest.\u201d</p><p>He had her there. \u201cFair enough. Now that this has come up, I assure you I have no interest in any red male. No gray either.\u201d She smiled sweetly.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Tom released her to another man and gave him a look that meant he\u2019d better keep his distance. Then he headed to speak to Darien.</p><p>\u201cName\u2019s Avery,\u201d the man said to Carol, taking her arm. His light amber eyes matched his pale brown suit and compared to Christian, he had a much tamer look. His actions mirrored that, as his touch was light, not the least bit invasive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard McKinley wants to talk to you later tonight about the investigation. Darien\u2019s not happy about it.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. She wasn\u2019t happy about it, either.</p><p>\u201cAnd now McKinley seems to be targeting Marilee, like he can\u2019t make up his mind which of you he wants.\u201d</p><p>Carol looked around at the dancing couples and saw Ryan dancing with the masseuse. He was back for a return engagement. Carol attempted to hide a scowl. Ryan kept his distance with Marilee, but the woman attempted to snuggle closer. Wanting the alpha male? Had she learned he was an unmated pack leader? Or did returning to her show he truly was interested in her?</p><p>\u201cHave you danced with her?\u201d Carol tried for cheerful, not annoyed, when she shouldn\u2019t have cared in the least.</p><p>Avery stiffened. \u201cShe seems intent on making the move on McKinley more than she does with any of the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Just as Carol suspected. Either she truly did find Ryan more appealing than the other men, or she was targeting him because of his position.</p><p>Becky was still dancing with Mervin, but he kept casting glances in Carol\u2019s direction. Poor Becky. Carol knew the feeling, having dated a guy on a blind date who had eyes only for the girlfriend who had double-dated with another man.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think of Becky?\u201d she asked Avery.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had the opportunity to meet her. What happened between you and Mervin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Brother, she didn\u2019t think this was going to be so blown out of proportion. But then again, packs were close knit, she was learning, much more so than a human community, although juicy gossip often spread from social group to social group, no matter whether they were human or otherwise. She just hadn\u2019t expected all the questioning.</p><p>The song ended, and out of nowhere, Ryan stepped in to dance with Carol, like a silent predatory wolf closing in on its prey. She wasn\u2019t sure if that meant he wanted to dance with her or to rip Avery to shreds.</p><p>Instantly, everything changed between them. Avery scowled and hesitated to step aside. Ryan didn\u2019t let that stop him. He slid his hand around Carol\u2019s back and pulled her close and away from Avery. She couldn\u2019t quash the annoyance she felt toward Ryan not only because he planned to interrogate her later to try and prove her a fraud, but also because he seemed so eager to get to know the masseuse better. That shouldn\u2019t have mattered, but irritatingly it did.</p><p>She pushed away from him and held him apart, like she\u2019d danced with the others, not wanting to go so far as to deny him a dance and then have to explain to Darien, his brothers, and Lelandi, why she had said \u201cno\u201d to a dance. She was sure they\u2019d all think he\u2019d done something horribly scandalous. And then they\u2019d send him away. Which bothered her more than she should have allowed.</p><p>Except for the music, everyone was quiet, and she feared they were watching every move she and Ryan made.</p><p>In perfect gentlemanly form, he moved with her across the floor, not saying a word, not pressing the issue. Then when she thought she couldn\u2019t stand the raw tension between them any longer, Ryan lowered his head and whispered in her ear, sending warm tendrils of fission cascading through her: \u201cWant to leave?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT SLID THROUGH CAROL WHEN RYAN asked if she wanted to leave the gathering. He didn\u2019t want to hold her close and dance after all. He just wanted to get this charade over, question her to satisfy some stupid need, and leave Silver Town. Either that, or he had wanted to dance with her but only close, and beyond that, no deal.</p><p>And she realized then just how much she desired being with a man like Ryan.</p><p>What the hell. At least Ryan had wanted to dance intimately with her, unlike the way he\u2019d kept Marilee at arm\u2019s length. Carol let out her breath, pulled him close, and melted against his heated embrace, loving the way he felt.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been with a guy who stirred her up like this since she was a nineteen-year-old in love with a twenty-one-year-old cad, who had used her and thrown her away for a much hotter number after a few months. Come to think of it, that hotter number had looked similar to Marilee, with darker hair and eyes and long lashes.</p><p>Carol sighed deeply. She didn\u2019t care if Ryan might be infatuated with someone who looked or acted like the masseuse. It was only a dance, after all.</p><p>Ryan didn\u2019t say anything about Carol holding him close at first. He just responded in kind, moving her across the floor slowly, his body pressed indecently against hers, heating her all the way from the crown of her head to the tips of her toes.</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d he finally queried, pressing the issue of leaving.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She began pulling away, figuring she might as well get this over with, if Ryan really didn\u2019t want to dance with her. She\u2019d show Darien she wasn\u2019t going to be part of the nonsense of this gathering any longer. At least she hoped she could. He might have words to say about it.</p><p>\u201cAfter we finish this waltz. Breaking off the dance after we\u2019ve barely begun would be inappropriate.\u201d His voice was husky and heated, and his eyes clouded with desire\u2014or maybe just plain lust.</p><p>That\u2019s when she noted his growing arousal pressed heavily against her thigh. It hadn\u2019t been there when he\u2019d first pulled her close. Maybe Marilee hadn\u2019t intrigued him like Carol had thought.</p><p>She slipped her leg in between his in a suggestive way, rubbing against his erection. Teach him to want to hold her close in the beginning and not face the consequences. A throaty growl escaped his lips. She bit back a smile and placed her head against his chest so he couldn\u2019t see the amusement on her face\u2014and heard his heart beating at an increased tempo.</p><p>The smell of him\u2014hot-blooded virile man, no fussy colognes covering up his delicious manly fragrance, just the woodsy scent of cedar, sage, and citrus\u2014triggered an unexpected craving in her. And a reaction she didn\u2019t expect... her hormones tumbled wildly, and a musky fragrance of her own drifted to her nostrils.</p><p>Her lips parted in surprise. She still couldn\u2019t get used to being able to catch a whiff of smells so intimate that only wilder animals could normally sense them. She slipped one hand down his back and slid the other up his chest, feeling the muscles beneath the cottony fabric, every touch making them tense even harder.</p><p>His hands slid down her back, lower, until he was cupping her buttocks in a sexual way, leaning into her, making her wet for him. She almost laughed. So much for her attempt at enticing him to take notice. Ryan was an absolute wolf and well versed in the gift of seduction. Lelandi was right. With her, he was the perfect gentleman. With Carol, it was a whole different story.</p><p>If they hadn\u2019t both been werewolves, she would have suggested they go to a hotel\u2014in another town. Not that she\u2019d ever felt that way about a man on a first \u201cdate,\u201d but her wolf hormones must have had something to do with it. Or maybe it was just Ryan who brought out the desire in her. Except their kind didn\u2019t have casual sex. The act was a pledge to commit as mates for life.</p><p>Too bad. A romp with a macho wolf like him would have promised much pleasure, she was sure.</p><p>\u201cDarien doesn\u2019t like it that we\u2019re dancing so close,\u201d Ryan whispered into her hair, but he didn\u2019t make a move to distance himself from her, for which she was grateful.</p><p>The touch of Ryan\u2019s heated breath on her scalp sent a new tingling sensation sweeping through her. \u201cHmm, I\u2019ve never known you to care what he thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so,\u201d Ryan murmured huskily. \u201cI respect another pack\u2019s territory.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gave a short laugh. \u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t give up trying to solve Larissa\u2019s murder, even though Darien didn\u2019t want you here getting into his family\u2019s business? You persisted until you had your man.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s hands moved to her lower back as if she\u2019d hit a nerve. Sure, she\u2019d solved the case through her psychic talents. Was it that he didn\u2019t like that she, rather than he, had broken the case? Or was it strictly because of how she had been able to do so?</p><p>Fine, might as well take the conversation to something less sensitive. She didn\u2019t want him pushing her away in the middle of the dance and acting as though she was too repugnant to touch. Maybe he felt that way, but she sure as hell didn\u2019t want him to show that in front of all the others.</p> <p>That\u2019s when she noticed how nearly everyone was watching them, even those dancing on the floor.</p><p>Lelandi smiled at her as she passed by with Darien, dancing nice and close also. He was scowling at Ryan, big time. Silva smiled at her as she and Sam waltzed by, while he was behaving as though he was as irritated with Ryan as Darien was. Ditto with Tom and Jake standing on the sidelines. Tom\u2019s hands were in his pockets, and he shook his head. Jake folded his arms and gave her the evil eye rather than Ryan.</p><p>Yes, she knew it was all her fault. She should have kept some distance from Ryan. She smiled and winked at Jake. His hard expression grew even harder still. Teach him to taunt her about Mervin being interested in her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to see what the bachelor males thought of the situation. She just hoped they wouldn\u2019t gang up on Ryan later and give him a rough time. Although as alpha as he was and as beta as they were, she figured they didn\u2019t stand a chance.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you think of Marilee?\u201d she asked him, her question an attempt at light and unconcerned.</p> <p>Immediately, Ryan\u2019s hands returned to Carol\u2019s rump and he rested them there, the sensuous touch making her heartbeat quicken. So what did his reaction mean? He liked Marilee and wished he had his hands on her backside instead? Carol hated how she always overanalyzed people\u2019s behaviors.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Ryan said, and she didn\u2019t like the way he said it, thinking he enjoyed being with Marilee more, like some horny male, as he continued to dance with Carol crushed against his chest, his leg locked between hers and moving at intervals to brush her mound in an enticing caress.</p><p>She could imagine him closing his eyes and envisioning he had that hot, sultry number in his tight clutches instead\u2014the long, curly hair, the luscious glistening lips, the fluttering long, dark lashes... all together tall, dark, and bosomy. Not short, pale and... well, Carol had nice-sized boobs, too, but that was about it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s... not... my type,\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>Carol glided with him across the smooth tile floor, trying to let herself just soak up the moment, but she couldn\u2019t give up the gnawing notion that he liked the other women better. They were grays, had been born as such, and weren\u2019t an enigma like she was. Why wouldn\u2019t he prefer them to her?</p><p>When she didn\u2019t say anything in response, he sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s too... clingy, too... sweet, too...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHot?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said she wasn\u2019t hot. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m interested.\u201d He lifted Carol\u2019s chin and looked into her eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to prove anything to anyone here tonight.\u201d</p><p>Which meant what? She wondered if he felt a connection with her, maybe because of her solving the murder \u2014not in the way he would, but that she could\u2014 like he did in his line of work. Like a fellow investigator, even though she hadn\u2019t investigated anything. Maybe he didn\u2019t really feel anything for the other women. Except that one was hot.</p><p>\u201cDid you dance with Becky?\u201d she asked, wondering what he thought of her. \u201cShe seems to need rescuing from Mervin.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s face turned dark. \u201cWhat happened between you and Mervin?\u201d</p><p>Not expecting him to question her about Mervin also, she pursed her lips in annoyance. And wished she hadn\u2019t brought Mervin\u2019s name up.</p><p>Carol shook her head. \u201cNothing happened between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make a lousy liar.\u201d</p> <p>She stiffened her back. Didn\u2019t matter that he was right, but she didn\u2019t need him telling her so.</p><p>He immediately stroked her back as if attempting to placate her. \u201cI\u2019ll learn one way or another, Carol. It\u2019s what I do.\u201d His voice was back to being darkly seductive.</p><p>She harrumphed, although she admired him for looking doggedly into a situation until he discovered the truth. She just wished she wasn\u2019t the focus of one of his bloodhound hunts.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you already scare the truth out of him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI always get confirmation. That way I learn the real truth.\u201d He slid his hands down her bare arms with a sensuous sweep, caught her wrists, and turned them to consider her skin, his touch gentle, concerned. \u201cHe didn\u2019t bruise you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted in surprise. Did Ryan suspect what had happened? At this rate, she figured the truth would come out anyway. Except she wasn\u2019t mentioning the damned urge to shift. \u201cHe tried to stop me from leaving the house. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. That\u2019s what he said. And then? You decided to change into this?\u201d He slid his hands down her back again, skin against skin, then lower, caressing her body beneath the clinging silk and leaving a sizzling trail of desire. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She was still absorbing the sensual feel of his touch as she fought to respond with an intelligent reply, no matter how much he unsettled her\u2014both with his words and actions.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if you really want a chance to have me for your own, you\u2019ll have to quit questioning my motives all the time. And frankly, Chester Ryan McKinley, it is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>He whispered against her ear, \u201cWhy would you think I\u2019m attempting to pursue you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled just a hint. \u201cIt\u2019s your nature. You want what you can\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a husky laugh and moved his hands to her buttocks again. \u201cIf I wanted you, make no mistake, Carol, you would be mine.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled and rested her head against his chest again. \u201cI love a man with a sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He continued to dance slow with her, his arousal throbbing with need\u2014that she\u2019d happily created\u2014and his hands treacherously sliding over her buttocks in a sensual caress. If he didn\u2019t want her, he sure was a master at deception.</p><p>She was beginning to think maybe he really was interested in her, and her psychic business was what still bothered him. Then to her disappointment, the music ended, and another man stood at her elbow, ready to dance with her next. She hoped he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d want to dance close with him, too.</p><p>But would Ryan rescue her and take her to the tavern instead, like he\u2019d wanted to, or give her up to the guy who was now tapping his foot on the floor, hands on his hips, an annoyed expression darkening his face?</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Ryan said to the man. \u201cShe promised me two dances.\u201d</p><p>She was shocked speechless and quickly snapped her gaping mouth shut.</p><p>The guy scowled. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>The music began again, and Ryan pulled Carol deeper into the group of dancing couples.</p><p>\u201cI thought we were going on our date next,\u201d she said, amused that Ryan seemed reluctant to let her go.</p><p>\u201cWe are on our date. First here, then at the tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not a real date, and you\u2019re making a lot of men angry.\u201d She frowned up at him, really hoping he wouldn\u2019t have a fight with the other men over her. Inwardly, she laughed at that. No one would have ever fought over her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll get over it when I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>Her heart hitched a little, when she shouldn\u2019t have cared one bit. She should have known. Maybe he already had his sights set on a woman in his pack.</p><p>As soon as the music stopped, Ryan hurried her to the great room, his hand clamped around her wrist, moving at double-time. Thankfully, his touch didn\u2019t force the urge to shift.</p><p>She was afraid to see who would come after them\u2014 Darien, his brothers, Sam\u2014all intending to put a stop to it. But all that happened was the sunroom remained really quiet. No music, no conversation, just Carol\u2019s heels clicking on the tile floor, headed toward the foyer as Ryan rushed her to the front door.</p><p>And then Darien\u2019s harsh holler came from the sunroom, \u201cRemember what I said, McKinley! Bring her back by midnight.\u201d</p><p>Surprised he\u2019d allowed it, she wondered if Lelandi had convinced him to let her go with Ryan.</p><p>\u201cI feel like we\u2019re eloping,\u201d Carol said, frowning at Ryan, barely able to keep up with his long stride while she teetered in high heels as he hauled her out of the house to his vehicle.</p><p>He raised his brows. \u201cJust a meeting to set some things right.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what he thought.</p><p>\u201cHope you\u2019re not too disappointed when you go home alone to your bed tonight without the answers you are looking for.\u201d She gave him a sweet smile as he opened the pickup door for her, and she climbed into the passenger\u2019s seat.</p><p>His expression was noncommittal. \u201cMy conscience is clear, and I sleep well at night. What about you?\u201d</p><p>She turned away and looked out the windshield as he still held her door, waiting for her response. She didn\u2019t sleep well at all. Certainly not last night after fighting the craving to shape-shift half the evening. Her lack of sleep had nothing to do with having a bad conscience and all to do with the moon and a wolf named Ryan who had come to her in a vision. Mervin, too, wearing his red-and-white-striped jacket.</p><p>\u201cI sleep wonderfully well.\u201d She gave Ryan a quick smile.</p><p>He smirked. \u201cRight. That\u2019s why you have dark circles under your eyes. I am trained to observe people and objects. I notice things.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cThis won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>Which suited her just fine. She folded her hands in her lap and nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s get it over with. The sooner the better.\u201d But she wanted to look in the visor mirror and see for herself if she had dark circles under her eyes. She hadn\u2019t noticed when she smoothed lipstick over her lips or applied makeup earlier. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shut her door, skirted around his vehicle, and climbed into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>There was no figuring what was going on in Ryan McKinley\u2019s investigative mind, but why was she bothered by the notion that he\u2019d be leaving soon?</p><p>He considered her for a moment and then nodded. But something was off in the way he acted. As though he had to finish this so he could get to more important business back home, yet he didn\u2019t want to let go of the business here so quickly, either. What was that all about anyway?</p> <p>Ryan circled the truck around the drive and then headed toward town.</p><p>No, it was something deeper than that. Something sexy, more primal, more wolf. If she shape-shifted, would it help her to recognize better what was going on between them? Or was her usual cynicism about men blocking her ability to see what was really happening?</p><p>Giving up on psychoanalyzing the situation further, she leaned into the seat and smelled the fragrance of new leather. She noted the spotless dashboard and a medallion hanging from the rearview mirror as it swung with the movement of the truck. She tried to glimpse the words etched on the medallion, on a brass plate below the name MacKinlay.</p><p>\u201cWhat does the motto mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018We force no friend; we fear no foe,\u2019 which was the motto for the Clan Farquharson. But some say we were associated with the Buchanan clan instead. Others say a people named MacAnleighs might have been more related to our origin.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t say anything further, and she prompted him, \u201cGo on. Family roots fascinate me. Sometimes the meaning of a name gives a hint to a family\u2019s origins. Maybe something about their character that is passed down from generation to generation.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved up a little. \u201cNever know. Since we had more family in the area of Braemar, we go with Clan Farquharson\u2019s motto. McKinley is a variation of MacKinlay. Some say the name originated from the Gaelic \u2018Mac Fhionnlaoich,\u2019 meaning \u2018fair hero.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair hero. Hmm. See? What did I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but another meaning is given. \u2018Son,\u2019 for Mac, \u2018of the white warrior.\u2019\u201d He waited for her response.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSeems, with the occupation you\u2019ve chosen, you carry the gene that validates the claim for both the motto and the meaning of your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try to live up to the name, to make my ancestors proud.\u201d</p> <p>She noticed the blanket lying on the seat between them, a predominantly blue-and-green plaid wool with black and red threads woven in, accentuating it. She ran her hand over the soft fabric.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s old,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>\u201cIt represents the McKinley clan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was my grandfather\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Chill bumps raced along her arms. Lelandi had explained to Carol how the lupus garous lived long lives, thirty years for every year after they reached puberty. So his grandfather could very well have fought in clan battles and been a clan chief even. Or not. He might have just been a sheepherder, for all she knew. She\u2019d read so many Highland romances that the idea she could be sitting next to the descendant of one of those brawny men\u2014barelegged, barefooted, and bare... she smiled... bare-assed men of the kilt\u2014made her melt a little.</p><p>Ryan glanced at her and gave her a suggestion of a smile. Her cheeks instantly flushed with heat. He winked. \u201cYou may see visions of the future, but I wish I could read your mind.\u201d</p><p>Her face heated anew. She pushed some of her hair behind an ear and looked out the windshield. \u201cWhat did your grandfather do as an occupation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFought for the clan, took a mate, raised a passel of kids, and whittled in his spare time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhittled?\u201d</p><p>Ryan chuckled. \u201cThat he did. Played the bagpipes, too.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and touched the blanket on the seat, imagining what it would be like to fall into one of her romance novels and feel the soft plaid on a Highlander\u2019s hardened body until he slipped it off and settled it on the heather. Hand outstretched, he\u2019d offer to take her into his world and show her just how hardy a Highlander could be.</p><p>Her lips dry, she was sweeping her tongue over them when she caught Ryan glancing at her again. \u201cHave you ever been to the Colorado Scottish Festival and Rocky Mountain Highland Games?\u201d she asked wistfully. She had loved the place on the one chance she\u2019d had to visit. All those Celts dressed in different tartans. The music. The games. The food.</p><p>\u201cTo listen to the pipes and drums, to step to the Celtic tunes, dance in the Highland competitions, participate in tug-of-war, and the parade of clans? I\u2019ve participated every year for the past four years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThe truth is that a werewolf\u2019s strength gives me a bit of an advantage.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t help it. Have you been?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cOnce. All those men in kilts with great-looking legs nearly did me in.\u201d</p><p>He gave her another shadow of a smile. \u201cDo you have a Scottish background?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacDonald, on my mother\u2019s side of the family. Our motto: \u2018By sea and land.\u2019 We have an armored hand holding a cross for the clan\u2019s crest. After I went to that one festival, I went away to college, but I hope to go this summer again. Maybe I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d</p><p>And see Ryan in a kilt, his legs bare, naked biceps and back straining to pull at a rope as men on the other side fight to win the game. Darien probably wouldn\u2019t even let her go to the festivities, unless some of his people were willing to watch her.</p><p>Or if she had a mate already. And then her mate probably wouldn\u2019t be interested in going there unless he had Celtic roots. She chewed on her bottom lip. She had to find other men who appealed like Ryan did, since she didn\u2019t think Jake or Tom would ever make a move in her direction.</p><p>Then a new thought came to her. The librarian and masseuse were from another pack. Why couldn\u2019t she go to their pack, or even Ryan\u2019s, and see if someone who suited her better was in one of those packs?</p><p>She patted Ryan\u2019s thigh, making him tense and speed up as he barreled down the road.</p><p>\u201cI have an idea. When you have your next gathering, I\u2019ll come to Green Valley and check out the eligible bachelors there,\u201d she said. \u201cHave any good hardy Scots in the bunch?\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s mouth opened as if he was going to make a comment, but then he quickly snapped it shut. He tapped his thumbs on the steering wheel and finally said, \u201cDarien wouldn\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p><p>She was a little surprised at his reaction. \u201cFunny, I thought you might be less against it than he would be. I\u2019ve heard that a pack leader who can encourage unmated females to accept bachelors in his pack earns brownie points.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s jaw tightened, and she assumed she\u2019d hit another nerve. But she wasn\u2019t sure why this time, unless someone in his pack might truly be interested in her.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll check into Becky and Marilee\u2019s pack while I\u2019m at it. Surely, I\u2019ll find someone I\u2019ll be interested in. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>HELL AND DAMNATION. RYAN COULDN\u2019T BELIEVE HOW much the petite blonde could get under his skin. One minute she\u2019s touching his plaid, while he\u2019s wishing he was wearing it right that moment, wondering when she\u2019d ask the question all women asked. Did he wear anything under the kilt? Ha, what God gave him. The next minute, she\u2019s wanting to find a mate in his pack?</p><p>How Carol could think the other women were hot and she wasn\u2019t was beyond his comprehension. But the notion that she\u2019d come to his pack and check out some of his bachelor males was unthinkable. Not that it wouldn\u2019t help his standing in the pack. But hell. Seeing her mated to one of his men\u2014not any of whom would be right for her... he couldn\u2019t have it.</p><p>Even the notion that she\u2019d check out the other women\u2019s pack didn\u2019t agree with him. Who knew what sort of men were in it? These women weren\u2019t interested in their own bachelors. Why would Carol be? Besides, she was a special case. With special needs, because she was newly turned. She had to have just the right man.</p><p>He had no regrets about dancing close to her. He\u2019d thought she might be feeling insecure about the way the other women looked because she\u2019d changed into the clingy silk dress, and he\u2019d wanted her to know she was just as hot an item in the soft pink sweater and jeans she\u2019d worn earlier. He loved comfortable casual.</p><p>But he\u2019d never expected her to turn his body into a raging inferno. Even now, he was still at half-mast, partly because of the way she\u2019d danced with him, the heat and fragrance and softness of her body still lingering in his thoughts. And partly because of the way she had caressed his plaid. Envisioning his body wrapped in it and her touching him made him harden even further.</p><p>He tried not to frown at her too much as he parked at the Silver Town Tavern, the lot fairly empty. He would speak to Darien about ensuring she didn\u2019t check out the other pack. Or his own.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked her as she stared out the window.</p><p>She snapped her head around to look at him, her expression startled, and he thought something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, but the expression was forced. \u201cSure. Let\u2019s get the interrogation over with. Pronto. I\u2019m sure you have more important business to take care of back home.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the smile, and her look turned mutinous. Which appealed a hell of a lot more than when she was giving him a fake smile. Wondering about his own sanity, he shook his head and left the truck to get her door.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s question had yanked her out of a vision so fast that it startled Carol, but since he didn\u2019t believe she could see what she could, she hadn\u2019t any plan to enlighten him. Yet given the way he looked at her, she figured he\u2019d question her about it anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking when I drew your attention?\u201d Ryan asked, helping her from his vehicle.</p><p>The biting cold... silky red hair floating over her face... male amber eyes narrowed, padded armor, and a tiredness she couldn\u2019t free herself from. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCarol?\u201d Ryan asked again, his hand firmly on her arm as he guided her toward the tavern.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>But the look he gave her told her he knew differently. He gave his head a slight shake. But what did she care? He wouldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d had another one of her visions. Anyway. And the meaning of the vision eluded her as before, so what was she supposed to say? Even if he had been more enlightened?</p> <p>She walked at Ryan\u2019s quickened pace, observing the carved wooden wolves guarding the double doors of the bar. If she\u2019d only known in the beginning what they had signified. Werewolf territory.</p><p>Before she\u2019d become a werewolf, Carol had only been in Silver Town\u2019s tavern once during the fall festival when the doors were open to non-members as well as members. She hadn\u2019t realized that to obtain memberships, citizens had to be card-carrying werewolves.</p><p>Ryan hurried to get the tavern door for Carol, the rusty hinges squealing as he pushed the heavy oak aside. Rustic fans circulating the air were probably new but looked antique enough to have been hanging from the time the place opened in the nineteenth century.</p><p>The smoky mirror behind the long, polished bar definitely had been there from the early days, and the counter was worn in spots where folks leaned against it, drinking their choice of poison. She imagined the shadows of people from long ago reflected in the dingy glass. Silva swore she was going to make Sam replace it with new mirrors, but Sam was a rustic himself and wouldn\u2019t go along with it. Maybe because he was cheap, too.</p><p>Amber glass lights hung on brass rods from the high ceiling, casting a soft light over the dark wood tables, some round for smaller groups, some long and rectangular for larger crowds. The place was fairly empty, with just a few older couples enjoying drinks and conversation. The talking died when Ryan and Carol walked inside.</p> <p>Many of Darien\u2019s pack were still at the gathering. Sam and Silva had returned at some point and were preparing roast beef sandwiches and drinks, the aroma of the roasting beef filling the air. Silva hurried to greet them and directed them to a table in the center of the room surrounded by other tables.</p><p>A fishbowl.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d prefer one over here, thanks.\u201d Ryan guided Carol to a table in a corner of the room where it was out of the traffic, half hidden in shadows, quiet, and easier to talk privately. And unavailable.</p><p>\u201cThis is Darien\u2019s table,\u201d Carol whispered, her heartbeat accelerating, but she had a sneaking suspicion Ryan already knew that.</p><p>Silva tapped a pen on an order pad. \u201cBoss man sits here with Lelandi and his brothers. I\u2019ll show you to another table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not coming here tonight,\u201d Ryan told her and pulled out a chair for Carol so self-assuredly that his move fed her own confidence.</p> <p>His amber eyes steeled, Sam wiped the bar. \u201cDarien might not be here tonight, but his brothers will be, guaranteed. And they also sit there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d Ryan gave him a look that meant he would not be dissuaded. \u201cDarien suggested we come here on our date. So I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t mind if we take the most out-of-the-way, private spot.\u201d</p><p>Silva looked at Carol as if hoping she would make Ryan come to his senses. Carol only smiled, figuring what the heck, and took her seat. She\u2019d already done enough to create a scene or two, why not another?</p><p>\u201cYep. I figure capturing Darien\u2019s ribbon today entitles me to a reward.\u201d</p><p>Ryan gave her a small nod of approval and pulled his own chair out and sat down.</p><p>Sam poured a beer for a man at the bar and inclined his head briefly to Silva, giving his okay. She let out her breath.</p><p>\u201cAll right. It\u2019s on Sam\u2019s head if Darien shows up expecting his table and finds it occupied. What would you care to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA strawberry daiquiri,\u201d Carol said.</p> <p>Silva\u2019s brows shot up into her bangs. \u201cYou always get a Chablis. Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, tonight\u2019s a cause for celebration.\u201d</p><p>Ryan leaned back in his chair. \u201cA beer for me, Silva. And a couple of hot roast beef sandwiches for the two of us, too.\u201d</p><p>Silva nodded. \u201cYou know, the word is getting around that you\u2019re here to question Carol about the murder case and then you\u2019re leaving for good. Best be quick about it, if that\u2019s all the business you have, because the bachelors are antsy about you being here. Rumors are circulating that it\u2019s more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have a lot more to worry about than me being here.\u201d</p><p>Her face brightening, Silva said, \u201cOh?\u201d Which meant she was delighted to share whatever the new gossip was around the tavern and the town.</p><p>\u201cSome red male is running around here without Darien\u2019s permission, possibly targeting Carol or Lelandi, or both. That\u2019s who everyone should be more concerned about.\u201d</p><p>Silva gave Carol a worried look.</p><p>Trying to appear unconcerned, Carol shrugged. \u201cThe bachelors are all going to be my bodyguards, and Lelandi will also be well protected. Nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan will be your bodyguard, too?\u201d Silva asked, hopeful.</p><p>Carol attempted a nonchalant tone for her response, but it came out more annoyed than she had planned. \u201cRyan\u2019s going home as soon as he grills me.\u201d</p><p>Silva gave him a hard look. \u201cYou could at least guard her. Be nice while you question her. If you\u2019re not... well, Sam will take care of you. Believe me, you don\u2019t want that.\u201d She whipped around and headed to the bar to get their drinks.</p><p>Carol loved having Silva as a friend. \u201cAsk your questions so you can return home.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Silva as she spoke with Sam, ordering their drinks. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to wait for your drink first, Carol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Think it\u2019ll make me tell the truth?\u201d</p><p>Ryan cast an elusive smile at her.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His smile broadened.</p><p>\u201cI mean that it won\u2019t get me drunk so that I\u2019ll tell the truth.\u201d She paused. \u201cI mean...\u201d she said, totally exasperated with herself, \u201cI\u2019m not telling you anything but the truth, no matter what. How do you suspect I learned about Larissa\u2019s murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou overheard something. I\u2019m not saying you consciously have tried to hide anything. Just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, that\u2019s nice to know.\u201d She didn\u2019t try to hide her annoyance. He might as well know that she didn\u2019t appreciate his questioning her as if she had something to hide. \u201cThe truth is that you don\u2019t believe in parapsychology. Right?\u201d She lifted her chin a hair.</p><p>Ryan had to keep a stern face on that one. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d get anywhere with Carol if he smirked as though he thought she didn\u2019t have any abilities. He just didn\u2019t believe in anything that couldn\u2019t be proven 100 percent. What she claimed to be able to do wouldn\u2019t hold up under any kind of scrutiny and couldn\u2019t be used in a court of law.</p><p>\u201cJust the facts, ma\u2019am. Solid, hard, physical facts,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She sat up straighter, and he loved her backbone. \u201cDid you know that I was a prisoner of Darien\u2019s household before the battle between the reds and grays occurred?\u201d</p><p>Not having known, Ryan frowned and pondered that. \u201cBefore you were turned?\u201d He drummed his fingers on the table, then quit. \u201cOf course. They feared for your safety because you\u2019d discovered something about the murderer. They were afraid whoever it was would be sure to silence you also.\u201d</p><p>Looking like she was fighting to keep from showing her irritation, Carol clenched her teeth. Then she leaned forward and speared him with a hard look. But no matter how irritated she looked, he couldn\u2019t help thinking how attractive she was, her blue eyes heated and narrowed, her face lightly flushed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. The reason also was that if Lelandi was injured, I\u2019d be her personal nurse. But the biggest reason?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEnlighten me.\u201d</p><p>Silva joined them with a tray of beers and one strawberry daiquiri. She leaned over the table and then deposited Carol\u2019s red frothy drink and his beer.</p><p>\u201cBefore she was changed, but way before she actually saw our kind frolicking in the woods, she had a premonition of it.\u201d</p><p>Ryan hadn\u2019t expected Silva to offer the explanation, and he really wished she\u2019d butt out, but he nodded. The so-called premonition was certainly easy to explain away. \u201cShe could have seen it happen, but not as a premonition.\u201d</p><p>Silva smiled. \u201cTell him, Carol. Tell him how you saw us.\u201d</p><p>Carol looked as though she didn\u2019t think he would believe her, and he wasn\u2019t sure she was going to bother explaining. She took a strawberry from a tiny, plastic pink sword in her drink, wrapped her glossy lips around it, and then sucked for a moment. He swore it was the most erotic thing he\u2019d seen in a long damn time. And that she did it on purpose to stir him up again.</p><p>Then she took a bite, chewed, and swallowed. \u201cI saw men and women shifting in the woods near Darien\u2019s place. They stripped out of their clothes, and in a blink of an eye, they were wolves.\u201d</p><p>His gaze shifted to her dipping the strawberry back in her drink, and then he watched as she licked the sweet liquid off the remainder of the strawberry. It made him think of the way her tongue had touched and tasted and teased his earlier in such a seductive fashion when he had kissed her. And he was damn ready for a repeat performance. How appealing it would be to taste the sweet flavor of strawberries on her tongue!</p><p>Not intending to allow the vixen to distract him further, he cleared his throat. \u201cI still say you could have seen this and then imagined that it had occurred as a vision. Dreamed it, whatever.\u201d</p><p>Carol licked her lips in such a sensuous way that he swore she was trying to make him hot all over again. Even if she wasn\u2019t doing so consciously, she sure had that effect on him. She dipped her strawberry back in the drink, pulled it out, slipped it into her mouth, and sighed.</p><p>Once she had finished the fruit, she pointed her tiny sword at him. \u201cNo, I saw everyone shift in the dark, and the night was foggy. As a human, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to see what you can.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He still didn\u2019t believe it. \u201cThe light from the house must have illuminated the forest some.\u201d</p><p>Carol gave a short laugh. \u201cYeah, right. Even you couldn\u2019t believe something so ludicrous. I\u2019d envisioned following the others into the woods. I hadn\u2019t been turned yet. The vision was vague. I only knew Lelandi wasn\u2019t with the men and women there. But I recognized some of Darien\u2019s people and tried to warn Lelandi about what Darien and his people were.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t from Silver Town, and because she was smaller, I thought she wasn\u2019t one of you. I thought she was like me and that Darien intended to change her. I\u2019d never suspected anyone could be born as a werewolf.\u201d</p> <p>Silva leveled her gaze at Ryan. \u201cYep, so how do you explain that?\u201d</p><p>Carol loved how Silva needled Ryan. She knew if Lelandi was here, she\u2019d gang up on him, too. Not that Carol couldn\u2019t hold her own, but it was nice to have the ladies backing her up. She\u2019d never had friends like that before.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s forehead wrinkled as he considered Silva in a disgruntled way. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be bringing us sandwiches?\u201d</p><p>Silva smiled. \u201cYesiree.\u201d She said to Carol, \u201cHe gives you any trouble, sugar, you just let me know.\u201d She sauntered off with the tray of beers for another table.</p><p>That\u2019s when the whole group from the gathering seemed to arrive at the tavern en masse. Darien walked in first with his arm possessively around Lelandi\u2019s shoulders. He looked straight at Ryan and Carol sitting at his table, but instead of making a fuss, he escorted Lelandi to a table nearer the restrooms.</p> <p>Carol took a relieved breath, glad at least Darien didn\u2019t seem to be bothered about this. Maybe Ryan had been right in thinking that Darien had set this up, so he didn\u2019t mind giving up his table to them because of it.</p><p>As Jake followed them inside, he grumbled, although sounding more amused than truly annoyed, \u201cSam needs a talking-to if every time we come here, he\u2019s allowing some outsider to sit at our table.\u201d</p><p>Darien slipped his arm down lower, around Lelandi\u2019s waist, and leaned over and kissed her cheek. \u201cWorked out well the last time.\u201d</p><p>Five men escorted Becky to a table. Marilee had several others falling all over her as they grabbed a table and stuck it against another farther away. Mervin was with the second group and gave Ryan another hard look.</p><p>Carol studied the women for a moment, still trying to remember where she\u2019d seen them. At the hospital? As patients? But they weren\u2019t from around here. Then again, Lelandi had said she\u2019d interviewed them, so maybe they\u2019d been here for a couple of days prior to the gathering. Or maybe earlier to see what Silver Town had to offer before they even expressed an interest in attending the gathering.</p><p>\u201cSo where were we?\u201d Carol asked Ryan, ready to end this. There was no convincing the stubborn man of science that what she could envision could really happen.</p> <p>\u201cYou were saying you saw our kind shifting while you were still strictly human. Then Darien would have had to turn you if one of Lelandi\u2019s pack hadn\u2019t during the battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But you missed my point. I didn\u2019t physically see them shape-shift in the woods. I saw it in a vision of the future way before the battle commenced. When I eventually did see the scene for real, I had already been turned.\u201d</p><p>She could tell he didn\u2019t believe a word of it. No reaction, no expression to indicate what he was thinking. Trying to figure out the next question he\u2019d ask her to see if he could tear her story into bits and prove it was all something made up from a way too vivid imagination?</p><p>She ought to tell him about the ghost she once saw. That was sure to go over really well. When she\u2019d told some friends about it, the ones who believed in apparitions had known she was telling the truth. The others had had the same look as Ryan did now. Disbelief, not even a small smirk in amusement. No, he was not amused. He was too steeped in scientific fact to believe in ghosts or anything else in the supernatural realm.</p><p>\u201cI bet you never read about fantasy worlds when you were young. Never believed in the Easter bunny or Santa Claus,\u201d she said.</p><p>He gave her a broad smile that made her wish she hadn\u2019t made the comment.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She let out her breath. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you and your kind don\u2019t believe in fantasy worlds. You\u2019re a living, breathing fantasy\u2014all of you...well, us\u2014if you want to really get technical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantasy is in the eye of the beholder. We are the stuff of legends, not fantasy exactly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight, so I have psychic visions, and you think that\u2019s fantasy. But for me, it\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>For an inkling, he appeared to consider her words as plausible. But then he said, \u201cI believe we\u2019ve established that fact.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMe believe in Santa Claus? Only if he wore a wolf suit sometimes.\u201d He smiled again.</p><p>\u201cOur versions of fairy tales might surprise you. Little Red Riding Hood? The wolf, as caring about children as a good family dog might be, was trying to escort Little Riding Hood home safely to her grandmother. The woodcutter was the villain. He didn\u2019t give the wolf a chance to prove he was one of the good guys. The woodcutter took one look at the wolf and immediately labeled him as a beast of prey. Our kids, of course, read the original version also, so they know what others are talking about. But we feel we\u2019re a little more open minded.\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows. \u201cI take it the wolf is not the bad guy in The Three Little Pigs, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, he was totally framed.\u201d Ryan gave her that wolfish grin that suited him so well. He pulled out his credit card, tapped it on the table while watching her, and then finally asked, \u201cDo you feel there\u2019s a reason for having the visions?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did, why do you think you have them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea why some people have a psychic connection and others don\u2019t. Probably just like no one knows why some have a photographic memory or can create music without any training or are geniuses in mathematics or quantum physics. Makes life more interesting when we\u2019re not all the same. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>He studied her, and she swore he was mulling that over. Maybe he wasn\u2019t hopeless after all when it came to believing in something that wasn\u2019t exactly scientifically proven.</p><p>She sighed deeply. \u201cNo one in my family has any paranormal abilities. At least not that anyone is willing to speak about. No one wanted me to reveal my talents, either. I even had nice little discussions with a psychiatrist, starting when I was seven.</p><p>\u201cDr. Metzger attempted to brainwash me for three years, trying to convince me I had an overactive imagination. That paranormal abilities weren\u2019t possible. That they couldn\u2019t be recreated in a scientific environment. In other words, those of us who have these abilities make mistakes like lab rats and don\u2019t get it \u2018right\u2019 all the time. So, we\u2019re phonies. All of us.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s jaw tightened fractionally. She wasn\u2019t sure what the message was there.</p><p>\u201cYou know what made Dr. Metzger finally give up on me?\u201d She raised her brows, waiting for Ryan to signal for her to continue. She\u2019d never discussed the reason with anyone except her mother because the psychiatrist had been so mad at Carol. She wouldn\u2019t have told Ryan, but for whatever reason, she wanted him to believe her. Not that telling him the story about the doctor would make any difference, but...</p><p>Ryan didn\u2019t say anything for a moment and then asked, \u201cWhat made him give up on you, Carol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw his wife and unborn child die in a car accident before it happened. At least I assumed it was going to happen. I didn\u2019t know anything about them. They might have died years earlier. But I saw his very pregnant wife driving the car, and she looked the same as the picture he had of her on his desk, probably taken shortly before the accident. I was sure it was a vision of some future happening.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have told him about it, but I thought maybe, just maybe, he could stop her from driving into the city. We lived in Denver at the time, but he lived out of town. In my vision, it was winter, and the roads were icy. Their car skidded on the slick roads and crashed into a tree. He didn\u2019t believe me. Got really angry instead. Said I was creating the tale because I was mad at him for trying to help me. Help me! Ha!\u201d</p><p>She silently fumed, remembering that day so well. Hot tears had filled her eyes, her throat closing.</p><p>\u201cHe said I was a horrible person for making such a story up.\u201d</p><p>No one had ever said anything like that about her. Not someone who was supposed to have her best interests at heart. Carol took a deep breath, the feelings of that day swamping her with regret. For years, she\u2019d wished she\u2019d never said a thing to him about his wife. At least she hadn\u2019t had to see him any further after that.</p><p>She looked at the table, fighting bitter tears. \u201cHe slammed his fist on the desk and cursed me. The frost giant and his icy blue eyes turned darker and colder. Tears rolled down my face. I was only ten at the time. No one had ever gotten that angry with me over anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, Carol. His license should have been revoked.\u201d</p><p>Carol shook her head. \u201cThe worst was yet to come. When I left his office, he called my mother in, and behind his closed door, he told her he wouldn\u2019t see me any longer. That I was hopeless. That I was making up horrible stories. My mother asked what kind of stories, but he wouldn\u2019t elaborate. I heard him tell her through the door of his office that if I was committed, I\u2019d quickly get over my need to make up these stories.\u201d</p><p>Ryan looked on the verge of getting up from his chair and coming around the table to comfort her, but she didn\u2019t need his comforting touch. She\u2019d dealt with the issues, and they were in the past. At least that\u2019s what she kept telling herself. Yet the memory of Metzger\u2019s piercing eyes and the way he\u2019d slammed his fist on the desk was forever imprinted on her brain.</p><p>\u201cMy mother kept asking me what I\u2019d said to Dr. Metzger. I couldn\u2019t tell her, not until later that night. In the beginning, I really had hoped the \u2018special\u2019 doctor could help me sort out my abilities. Sometimes I wished I didn\u2019t have them. Sometimes I wished everyone else did so they knew what it felt like. But denying my \u2018talents\u2019 wasn\u2019t feasible. So I just didn\u2019t let on that I had them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid Dr. Metzger\u2019s wife die?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>CAROL SLUMPED A LITTLE IN HER CHAIR AT THE TAVERN as she was aware of Ryan\u2019s intense gaze on her. She had found no satisfaction in having been right where Dr. Metzger\u2019s wife was concerned. She only wished he\u2019d saved her before Carol\u2019s vision had come true.</p> <p>\u201cYes, his wife died. Not immediately. Three days later, she drove into Denver, or was on her way to Denver, when her SUV slid on ice and she hit a tree. She was in a coma for a couple of days, and then she and her unborn child died.\u201d</p><p>When Ryan didn\u2019t speak, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s not an exact science. I didn\u2019t know when it would occur. But usually when I get a vision, it\u2019s something that will happen pretty soon.\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth and swallowed the bitterness that came with knowing something bad was going to occur and that she couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p><p>\u201cMom tried to keep it from me, not wanting to upset me. But I\u2019d been looking for the news story, hoping that if it did come to pass, Mom would finally believe me. We never talked about it though. I guess I was always afraid she might think it would be a good idea to have me committed.\u201d</p><p>Ryan reached out and took hold of Carol\u2019s hand and squeezed. Although she thought she wouldn\u2019t appreciate it, she loved the way he gave her a little of the solace she could have used years earlier. But then again, as much as she tried to tell herself she could deal with it, maybe she really wasn\u2019t doing that great a job still.</p> <p>\u201cHell, Carol, I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, no one does who doesn\u2019t live with an early warning system in their heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Metzger moved away from Denver, and I always wondered what he thought of my abilities then. Maybe if he had another patient who \u2018suffered\u2019 from my kind of delusions, he would treat them with more respect. Give them the benefit of the doubt. And maybe if he\u2019d listened to me, he could have saved his wife and unborn child. I don\u2019t know. I wanted to save them in the worst way, but no one would have ever believed me.\u201d</p><p>Ryan frowned but didn\u2019t release her hand. \u201cCan the future be altered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know for sure. My visions are hazy, not fully developed for the most part. So I suppose that in those cases, the truth of the matter hasn\u2019t really been revealed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you always foresee something bad?\u201d</p><p>She ran her free hand over her chilled glass. \u201cNo. It causes problems with Christmas presents and keeping them secret. Especially from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can touch an object and know something about its contents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes its history. I can see flashes of who had touched it and why. Sometimes a glimpse of the department where the item was purchased.\u201d</p><p>That brought a sexy smile to Ryan\u2019s lips, and his thumb stroked her hand with a gentle caress. That little stroke and the smile on his lips made butterflies flutter about in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cWish I could read minds,\u201d she said.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI can imagine you might sense some impressions others wouldn\u2019t want you to know about.\u201d But then his expression turned dark and he changed topics. \u201cWho is the red who was skulking around Darien\u2019s house? Is he after you or Lelandi? Or something else entirely?\u201d</p><p>At least he was done questioning her about her psychic abilities. \u201cLelandi thinks it might be the brother or a cousin of the one who bit me. The men are named Connor and North.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan closed his gaping mouth and sat very still. \u201cI thought they had all died. Hell, one of them wants you for revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Lelandi. Or maybe he just wants me. Not for revenge. Just as a mate.\u201d She shrugged like it didn\u2019t matter. Although it did. She definitely didn\u2019t want anything to do with Lelandi\u2019s old pack. She sure didn\u2019t want to be thought of as someone\u2019s possession because his brother or cousin had turned her.</p><p>Ryan glanced at Darien, who was still seated across the tavern with Lelandi and his brothers. \u201cYou said that Darien ordered the bachelor males to guard you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Who else?\u201d</p><p>Grinding his teeth, Ryan scowled. \u201cThey\u2019re not trained for this kind of work. Mervin\u2019s a damned barber. Avery? He sells gas at the local station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe owns the gas station and convenience store.\u201d</p><p>Ryan ignored the comment. \u201cAnd Christian? He\u2019s a used car salesman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cManager and owner of previously loved cars. At least two of the cars he has for sale are new.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shook his head. \u201cRight. Not one of them is qualified to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have to take my chances. Besides, any of them just has to shift, and that takes care of that.\u201d At least she figured it did. They all had very wicked canines when needed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all hunters when in our wolf form, Carol. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m referring to. In their human occupations, they don\u2019t normally hunt killers.\u201d</p><p>She reached over and patted his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have a premonition, and it will save you.\u201d He ground out the words, as if he couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d be that na\u00efve.</p><p>\u201cLike I had about being one of you?\u201d She raised her brows. \u201cNo. The premonitions are annoyingly unpredictable. So if I were to have one, it wouldn\u2019t mean it would help keep me safe.\u201d</p><p>His lips parted, and then he tilted his head to the side, a strange look on his face. \u201cHave you had any lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that you would believe.\u201d She took a long sip of her drink to steady her nerves.</p><p>She wanted to tell someone who would believe her because she knew something horrible was going to come to at least a few of the people in the pack and they would have to figure out a way to stop it. But hell, if people who normally believed her wouldn\u2019t about this, no way would a P.I. trust her visions when he didn\u2019t think her capable of having such abilities.</p><p>She shook her head. No. Until she saw more of the dilemma, she couldn\u2019t solicit anyone\u2019s help.</p><p>Ryan had never considered that Carol would have been plagued by visions when she was young and that her parents would have sent her to a psychiatrist for it. Hell. The bastard should have had his license revoked for the way he\u2019d treated Carol. Ryan hated seeing how much the earlier experience had affected her, even though she had fought revealing her feelings.</p><p>If she was as young as seven when she began having visions, she might truly have abilities. He shook his head at himself. As an investigator, he had to look into this new lead before he began jumping to unsubstantiated conclusions.</p><p>He was also torn over the new information concerning the red who could be stalking the women. He really thought it was that cousin of Lelandi\u2019s, Ural, and no real problem. The guy was a nuisance but not a threat.</p><p>If it was the brother or cousin of the one who had bitten Carol, was he after her? Or Lelandi? Either would be a prime target for a disgruntled pack that had lost a battle with the grays. And both male reds could be dangerous.</p><p>Darien would ensure that Lelandi had the utmost security as the pack leader\u2019s mate, and he stayed with her all night, so no problem there. But Carol... Darien couldn\u2019t be serious about having the lame betas serve as bodyguards for her. And the notion that any of the others would stay with Carol during the night... hell, that got his blood pressure up.</p><p>But something more was troubling her. Something had been bothering her in the truck when they\u2019d parked at the tavern. And she wasn\u2019t sleeping, although Ryan hadn\u2019t meant to upset her when he mentioned it. He couldn\u2019t help but notice the circles under her eyes, and he wanted to know what was disturbing her sleep so much. After he mentioned it, he figured he hadn\u2019t quite posed the question in a manner meant to solicit the truth. Instead, he\u2019d antagonized her.</p><p>Might as well get this over with and ask what she thought she\u2019d envisioned, while he tried to keep an open mind. He tilted his chin down slightly, and with his most\u2014or at least what he hoped was his most\u2014reassuring expression, he said, \u201cI\u2019m a reasonable man. Try me.\u201d</p><p>She studied him for several long seconds, and he wondered what tale she\u2019d come up with. She finally took a deep breath and seemed to come to the conclusion that she might as well talk. Humor him, maybe. \u201cDarien shape-shifts but can\u2019t shift back to his human form. Lelandi\u2019s worried sick about it, but I haven\u2019t a clue as to what to do.\u201d</p><p>What she thought she\u2019d envisioned wasn\u2019t possible. He didn\u2019t say anything, and the look on her face said she knew she\u2019d wasted her breath on him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve told them?\u201d He wondered how they had reacted to the news. Not that it would persuade him to believe in something he truly couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I mean, not Darien. Lelandi, yes.\u201d But from the bleak expression on Carol\u2019s face, he assumed Lelandi hadn\u2019t believed her. He wished that she had, for Carol\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t think what you had to say had any merit.\u201d Ryan folded his arms, suspecting Lelandi didn\u2019t believe her for the same reason he didn\u2019t. What Carol thought she saw just couldn\u2019t happen. Probably nightmares brought on by all the changes in her life recently.</p><p>She finished her drink and stared at the table, and he figured he might have upset her, which he\u2019d had no intention of doing, by bringing up the subject of recent visions.</p><p>Ryan let out a heavy sigh. \u201cCarol, is this nightmare you\u2019re having about Darien not being able to shift back what\u2019s troubling you and keeping you from shifting? And consequently keeping you from sleeping nights? Because I\u2019ve got to tell you that Lelandi\u2019s case, where she was afraid her brother would die and she couldn\u2019t shift back, is the only case I\u2019ve ever heard of.\u201d</p><p>Carol smiled as if he was so off base it amused her in a cynical way, and then she leaned back against her chair and promptly changed the topic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo if I needed a bodyguard, since you\u2019ve got the qualifications, could I hire you? Since you don\u2019t believe anyone here is qualified. Although it depends on your going rate. I can\u2019t be too frivolous with my hard-earned income.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her, not liking that she switched the subject, so he had no qualms about changing it again, thinking about what Jake had confided in him about Carol not shape-shifting yet. He didn\u2019t believe she could fight the change for five months.</p><p>\u201cYou have shape-shifted, haven\u2019t you? Without anyone being aware of it. You\u2019ve had to run as a wolf and haven\u2019t had time to sleep to make up for it. Am I right?\u201d</p> <p>The corner of her mouth inched up. \u201cSure, I\u2019ve shape-shifted. And you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve been running around in the woods at night, but I have to work at the hospital during the day and haven\u2019t had any time to take a wolfish nap. You really are a great detective. But then I\u2019m sure you already knew that.\u201d</p><p>She was too coy and had switched too easily from being indignant to being complacent. He gave her a small smile. \u201cYou can\u2019t be fighting the shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, when you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d rather she\u2019d continue to be indignant. Like this, she was too agreeable and toying with him. He took another tack. \u201cI found no sign of your wolf scent in the woods. You haven\u2019t been running through them as a wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight again. I run around the guestroom at night. Haven\u2019t howled yet, though.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cNot sure how to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan lifted a brow. \u201cIt comes with the shift. A natural part of who you are. Instinctively, if you\u2019re to howl to let others know where you are, to gather the pack, to warn others away, you howl. If not, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I haven\u2019t needed to howl.\u201d</p><p>He rested his arms on the table and leaned closer, unable to shake loose of what he knew had to be the truth. \u201cYou can\u2019t be refusing to shift.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cRefuse to shift? Of course I can\u2019t. That\u2019s impossible. Everyone keeps telling me that.\u201d</p><p>Hell. She couldn\u2019t be stopping the shift. But then again, the woman was unusual. Intriguing. Maybe she did have the inner strength to fight it. He tried another ploy.</p><p>\u201cHow does it feel when you shift?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFurry.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and then grew serious again. \u201cHow are you keeping from shifting?\u201d</p><p>She smiled just a little, her eyes, her lips. Something about that look made him think of a wayward wolf, full of mischief, impish, not to be trusted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me. Your visions are keeping you from...\u201d His mouth gaped as he recalled another incident. \u201cWhen Mervin grabbed you in the great room, he triggered your need to shift, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Her expression froze, and she didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>Which gave away what truly had happened. \u201cYou changed clothes but not to compete with the other women. That wouldn\u2019t be like you. Hell, you were stripping out of your clothes when Lelandi chased you down.\u201d</p><p>Ryan should have been there, not that lame Mervin. Although if he\u2019d seen Carol fighting the shift, he wasn\u2019t sure what he would have done. Tried to convince her to shift, learned what he could about how she was fighting it, maybe.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have a choice. Somehow you stopped the shift, and to cover up the fact you were in trouble, at least to your way of thinking, you changed clothes. Did Lelandi recognize what you were up to?\u201d</p> <p>Carol shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t get anything past you, can I?\u201d</p><p>Ryan rubbed his chin. No way could Carol stop shifting because of having so-called visions. Yet he\u2019d never heard of anyone so newly turned being able to control that aspect of his or her new condition.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a danger to yourself and others, Carol. You have to allow the shift to occur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Indignant, she rose from the table. \u201cTom can take me home, and I\u2019ll shift and run around the house for a while. Sorry I couldn\u2019t enlighten you further, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>The tavern grew deathly quiet.</p><p>Ryan rose to stand in front of her, towering over her. She looked up at him, and he swore her gaze pleaded with him to believe her. She looked so vulnerable, a little pale, and the dark under her eyes seemed to show even more now. She seemed tired\u2014tired of the grilling, tired of being made to participate in werewolf activities that she wasn\u2019t used to\u2014and now she had to be concerned that the red might be stalking her.</p><p>\u201cWhat vision did you have that stopped the shift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Darien shifts to a wolf and can\u2019t change back,\u201d she whispered, tears in her eyes. \u201cAnd I feel guilty because I believe I\u2019ll have more freedom if he is stuck as a wolf for a while, but Lelandi\u2019s so frightened, and I think of how it would be if all of our kind ended up in the same predicament. What then? If I shift, I\u2019ll be doomed to be a wolf forever.\u201d She bit her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t happen.\u201d He took her hand and squeezed. \u201cCarol, you can\u2019t keep fighting this. It\u2019s part of who we are. It\u2019s our nature. Yours and mine.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, pulled her hand free, and folded her arms tight around her waist. \u201cWhat better way to learn the truth about my future visions than to hang around and protect me while being my personal bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>Ryan pulled her back to her seat, watching her and pondering the notion. When she retook her seat, he took his, but the conversation in the room didn\u2019t begin again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll tell me every time you have the urge to shift. No matter when or where you are. And you\u2019ll let me know every time you have a vision? No matter what it\u2019s about?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin up. \u201cGladly.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and finished his beer and then stretched his hand out so they could shake on it. She sighed and offered her hand. He gave it a firm shake, felt the heat and a spark of electricity, and saw the hope in her eyes, those large pools of liquid blue. He felt that if he looked into them much longer, he\u2019d drown in them with pure pleasure. He released her, severing the connection. Somehow touching her made him feel as though he might be able to coax her to shift when others in her pack hadn\u2019t had any success.</p><p>He scoffed at himself. She needed a mate who would encourage her to capitulate.</p><p>Silva immediately hurried over with another beer and their sandwiches. \u201cOhmigod, McKinley, you can\u2019t be planning to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear our whole conversation, did you?\u201d Carol asked, her voice a little shaky.</p><p>\u201cWell, no, I have been waiting tables, and Darien, who is on the opposite side of the tavern, asked me a few questions. Despite what everyone says, I don\u2019t have hearing that sharp. But I did overhear you ask if Ryan would be your bodyguard.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t gotten Darien\u2019s approval,\u201d Silva warned. \u201cAnd you know how he is with outsiders interfering in pack business.\u201d She sighed. \u201cYou and Lelandi sure know how to stir up a pack. Did you need anything else to go with the sandwiches?\u201d</p><p>Privacy. Ryan cleared his throat. \u201cLooks good to me. Thanks, Silva.\u201d</p><p>Silva barely waited for Carol to answer, and when she shook her head, Silva stalked to the bar to grab another tray of drinks and sandwiches, and then hurried to drop them off at a table. After that, she rushed to Darien\u2019s table.</p><p>\u201cIf you want anyone to know your business, tell Silva. She\u2019ll spread the word,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>Ryan had already gotten that impression. He watched Darien\u2019s reaction as Silva spoke to him. Darien\u2019s eyes narrowed a bit.</p><p>Jake immediately looked in Ryan\u2019s direction and gave a knowing smile. He must have realized Ryan was up to the challenge. Tom flat-out frowned. Ryan had expected that. Lelandi smiled. Darien shook his head, gave Ryan a stern look, and then listened to something Lelandi said to him. He leaned over and kissed her lips.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think? Was that a yes or a no?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>Ryan felt as if she was testing him, but he turned the tables on her. He wouldn\u2019t let up until he knew the truth. \u201cYou\u2019re the one with future visions. What do you see?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. This was going to be a real test of wills. She lifted her sandwich. \u201cNothing in any future visions, but I\u2019d say Lelandi convinced him to give you a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll allow it,\u201d Ryan confirmed, no hesitation in his response. \u201cEither that or he\u2019s going to have to put one of his deputies or his brothers up to the task of protecting you. They\u2019ll be concentrating on Lelandi, in the event she\u2019s at risk. Because no matter what, he has to consider that someone from her old pack may want revenge. And stealing Darien\u2019s mate may be just the notion they have. So until it\u2019s proven otherwise\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more expendable.\u201d</p><p>Ryan raised his brows, not believing she would think that. No one in a pack was expendable. \u201cI\u2019m very capable of protecting you.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cWhat I was trying to say is that until it\u2019s proven otherwise, both of you need to be watched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She took a bite of her sandwich, then set the rest of it down on the plate and eyed Ryan. I wasn\u2019t sure why I\u2019d seen you in a vision before. They\u2019re always important for some reason and have some connection to me. Maybe this is it.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cYou saw me in a vision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mentioned it before, but you weren\u2019t paying attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I doing?\u201d He tried to sound like he believed her. He wondered if she was one of those people who told stories to get attention. He had a friend like that from Texas that he swore didn\u2019t even realize he was embellishing the truth because he believed in his own stories to such a degree.</p><p>\u201cI envisioned you watching me from the woods as a wolf. That\u2019s why I went to the window and looked out. That\u2019s why I went outside when I saw you standing there and then followed you. I wanted to know who you were and what you wanted. Now I suppose it was because you spied the red wolf and are going to protect me from him.\u201d She smiled, the expression sweet and innocent, yet he was sure it was a fa\u00e7ade. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was cute and good. But he didn\u2019t believe it. Although he had wondered what had brought her to the window. And why she had come to see him in the woods. \u201cYou seemed irritated with me at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d awakened me. I had worked a twelve-hour shift at the hospital, and I was trying to get some much-needed sleep.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound sincere, and she wouldn\u2019t look him in the eye. Something had kept her from sleeping.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to be more considerate next time. But in the future, if you spy a wolf in the woods and don\u2019t know who he is, don\u2019t seek him out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the future.\u201d The way she spoke indicated to him, that if she felt driven to do so, she\u2019d take off into the woods again and check him out.</p><p>That made his gut wrench with concern. He\u2019d prefer the damsel in distress to be agreeable. Made his work so much easier. He ate the last bite of the tender roast beef sandwich, the meat melting in his mouth. Then he wiped his fingers on the napkin and drew up taller.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to return to Green Valley to pick up some clothes and other articles. Darien and his brothers can keep you safe until then. At most, three hours, and I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Striving for professional, which he sure as hell had lost sight of when he\u2019d first kissed her and then danced with her, Ryan said, \u201cI have a job to do. No need to thank me.\u201d</p> <p>Her lips curved up slightly. He had the sneaking suspicion she saw right through him. Damned if the more primitive side of him didn\u2019t want to haul her out of her chair and kiss her again. Forget professional.</p><p>She gave him a hard nod. \u201cRight. Where will you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose. No sense in being your bodyguard if I\u2019m not nearby. And, Carol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear something other than that silky nightgown you wore last night. I don\u2019t need the distraction.\u201d He cast an elusive smile at her, winked, and rose. Then he slipped his credit card back in his wallet and deposited money on the table instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak to Darien and then be on my way. Don\u2019t leave the tavern without Darien or his brothers\u2019 escort home.\u201d</p> <p>She glanced at their table. \u201cI\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t think of my leaving without one of them accompanying me.\u201d</p><p>Watching Ryan and Carol, two of the bachelor males rose from their seats. \u201cChrist,\u201d Ryan swore under his breath and offered his hand. \u201cCome on. We\u2019ll talk to Darien together, and you can sit at his table until you\u2019re ready to leave.\u201d</p><p>Hell, what was wrong with him to get so possessive with her when this was strictly business? But he couldn\u2019t help worrying that this was all turning into a real nightmare.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>AFTER GETTING DARIEN\u2019S APPROVAL TO BE CAROL\u2019S bodyguard, Ryan returned home to grab a few days\u2019 changes of clothes and called on his sub-leader to watch the pack and his sister and to take over mayoral duties as his assistant mayor until he returned.</p><p>But his sister was giving him major heartburn. If he hadn\u2019t figured that she\u2019d be more trouble if he took her with him, he\u2019d have left her at the B&amp;B in Silver Town so she would be close by and he could check on her periodically. But her nursery sales were skyrocketing with the advent of spring, and he knew she wouldn\u2019t want to leave her business for anything.</p><p>\u201cChester Ryan McKinley,\u201d Rosalind scolded, as she continued to decorate the fireplace mantel in the living room with greenery, the fragrance of burning lilac candles scenting the air. \u201cDon\u2019t you walk away from me when I\u2019m trying to discuss this with you.\u201d</p><p>Ryan stopped in mid-stride and turned to frown at his sister, the only one in his pack who could get away with talking to him like that, but only in the privacy of his home\u2014and she damn well knew it. \u201cThe discussion is over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? You speak about that woman constantly. You can\u2019t get over how she discovered who the murderer was, when you were investigating the crime just fine with your tried and true scientific methods. Why can\u2019t you believe she\u2019s psychic?</p><p>\u201cAccording to Bertha, the owner of that bed and breakfast you stayed at, you not only went to the games to watch Carol but to the gathering and took her on a date. Now you\u2019re going to be her bodyguard? Admit that you feel something for her. Besides, you can use her on that case you can\u2019t solve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember the last time you insisted I use a psychic? What a disaster that was?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s lips and amber eyes smiled. \u201cAll right. So Madame Dulaney was a bona fide fraud. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo big deal?\u201d His voice rose although he meant to curb his temper, but the false psychic could have cost him everything. \u201cHell, if I hadn\u2019t agreed to go out with Bennagin\u2019s spoiled-rotten daughter, he would have sued me for everything we own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour business insurance would have covered it.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a scathing look.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cBesides, Miss Hoity-Toity-I\u2019m-Owed-Everything-Under-the-Sun soon gave up on wanting to hang around you. Three dates, and she was glad to get rid of you. You sure know how to make a girl feel unappreciated. Well, in her case, loathed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want me to do? Turn her and make her my mate?\u201d He shook his head at the horrible notion.</p><p>Rosaline smiled a little. \u201cNo. Then she would have been related to me. But from everything you\u2019ve told me about Carol Wood, this woman\u2019s the real deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI explained to you that she most likely overheard conversations that led her to the evidence. Nothing to do with psychic predictions. Besides, I don\u2019t need a psychic to tell me that Eleanor\u2019s husband isn\u2019t seeing anyone behind her back. That the woman is paranoid as usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about when you get another case? Carol could assist you.\u201d Rosalind tied another pink satin bow on the cedar garland. \u201cYou could help me trim for spring, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all thumbs when it comes to decorating,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes were downcast, and Rosalind\u2019s playful expression had faded. Ryan let out his breath in defeat. He guessed Rosalind missed their mother helping her decorate for the different seasons. He stalked over to the table where cut flowers from her greenhouse sat in crystal vases and a single sprig of mistletoe sat amongst them. He raised a brow.</p><p>Rosalind tried to hide a smile. \u201cWhy, how\u2019d that get in with my spring greenery? Carol\u2019s a red now. Rare red. Rare female at the right age for mating. Unless you aren\u2019t interested in her because she\u2019s newly turned. But having a newly turned mate offers advantages. You\u2019d be in charge of her, show her the ways of our people, have someone you could mold to your own liking. Seems to me she\u2019d suit your disposition perfectly.\u201d</p><p>Ryan snorted. \u201cThe woman is not in the least bit biddable.\u201d</p><p>That comment brought a real smile to his sister\u2019s lips. She\u2019d like him having a cantankerous mate, he suspected. And hell, his sister and his mate would most likely bond in womanly fashion and gang up on him. Not that he couldn\u2019t deal with them, but he really didn\u2019t need the added aggravation.</p><p>He put the mistletoe down on the coffee table and then grabbed a frilly lace bow and fumbled to tie it to the garland. Decorating was a woman\u2019s job. He glanced at the fireplace. The flames blazed hot on this chilly spring night, and wood was already stacked to the hilt in a copper box nearby.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve chopped enough firewood to keep us warm for the next three years. Which brings me to another point. You only split wood when something\u2019s bothering you. And lately only when Carol Wood\u2019s name comes up in the discussion. Suddenly you\u2019re out chopping down trees again.\u201d She raised a brow.</p><p>He ignored her and grabbed another frilly pink bow off the table. His sister was a gardener extraordinaire. When did she become a psychologist in her spare time?</p><p>Psychologist... hell, the psychiatrist. Dr. Metzger. The one who\u2019d given Carol so much grief. As soon as he had a chance, he was doing a little research into her story. Problem was that he might not be able to verify that the doctor\u2019s wife had died after Carol had told the doctor her vision, unless Ryan spoke with the psychiatrist and could verify the date. Even then, the doctor probably wouldn\u2019t tell him anything about Carol\u2019s session because of patient confidentiality.</p><p>Her mother! But would her mother tell him anything? Only one way to find out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to you, and you haven\u2019t heard a word I\u2019ve said.\u201d Rosalind wove a string of pearls through the garland. \u201cIf you put off going after her\u2014and I don\u2019t mean just being her babysitter\u2014Darien Silver will surely convince her to mate with one of his eligible and very willing bachelors. I wouldn\u2019t wait too long. If you want her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Rosalind! I have no idea where you\u2019ve come up with such nonsense. When have I even hinted I was interested in the woman, except to learn the truth of how she came to know what she did?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind pointed with her elbow at the coffee table and continued to wrap the string of pearls around the garland. \u201cIn that notebook, you have photos of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI added photos of many of Darien\u2019s people while I was investigating who might have been involved in the crime.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind finished with the pearls, walked back over to the table, flipped open the notebook, and pointed accusingly at the picture of Carol sitting on top\u2014just where he\u2019d left it.</p><p>\u201cRight, but why do you have seven photos of Carol? You\u2019ve filed away all the rest of your papers concerning the case, so why are her pictures still out? You said from the start that you didn\u2019t believe she was a suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d he muttered under his breath. Rosalind would be the one to make a mountain out of a ripple in the ground. \u201cThe case isn\u2019t closed until I learn how she knew of the evidence that confirmed the murderer\u2019s identity.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes round, Rosalind stared at him. \u201cYou think she\u2019s a co-conspirator? Guilty of taking part in the murder?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. Of course not. She was human at the time. They wouldn\u2019t have involved her. But she either wittingly or unwittingly overheard the conversation, and I\u2019d like to know which, for the record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, then why don\u2019t you prove it once and for all? Have her work with you on a case, and let her help you solve it. What if she\u2019s not psychic but just very good at discovering leads, like you are? Maybe if you gave this woman half a chance...\u201d His sister had a way of sounding facetious when it suited her.</p><p>\u201cEven if I wanted to, I doubt her pack leader would agree with my mating her.\u201d That slipped out before he had a chance to stop his words. Hell. The truth of the matter was that if he wanted her and she was mutually agreeable, no one would be an obstacle in their match.</p> <p>Rosalind\u2019s lips parted, and then she quickly smiled.</p><p>He let out his breath in exasperation. He refused to openly admit to Rosalind that the petite, blue-eyed blonde was on his mind twenty-four-seven. So much so that he couldn\u2019t concentrate on any P.I. case, nor could he keep a close handle on being mayor of Green Valley and pack leader. Ryan couldn\u2019t pinpoint what got to him about her the most. Yeah, she was a looker, but he wouldn\u2019t have noticed if not for all the attention she had received for solving the murder case through sharing her psychic knowledge.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t true, either. Her looks had definitely caught his eye. But the way she tried to protect Lelandi from being turned, not knowing she was already a lupus garou from birth, and Carol\u2019s strength in not falling apart during the battle that could have killed her\u2014that she didn\u2019t run away in stark terror\u2014those attributes kept nagging at him.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t know if Darien doesn\u2019t agree to your mating her until you try. You can\u2019t deny it, Ryan. You can\u2019t quit looking at those photos, and now you\u2019ve offered to be her bodyguard? But of course she suggested it, which to me sounds like she\u2019s in as deep as you are in this... situation. You can\u2019t disagree with me that you\u2019re dying to be with her longer. Oh sure, you\u2019ve tried to appear as though you are leisurely getting ready to leave, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you this seriously unsettled and distracted over anything. Or anyone.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shook his head and stalked toward the back door. The red who was skulking around Darien\u2019s place needed to be caught and confronted. In the meantime, Carol and Lelandi needed to be protected. That was all.</p> <p>\u201cIf you cut any more wood, we will no longer have a forest,\u201d Rosalind teased.</p><p>Ryan shoved the door open and slammed it closed behind him, then stared at the pile of wood stacked as high as the two-story potting shed. Rosalind was right. As much as he hated admitting it. They had enough firewood for three winters at least.</p><p>Fine. He\u2019d take a run on the wild side. Clear his thoughts on a long jog through the woods now shivering in a northerly breeze before he took off for Silver Town.</p><p>Ryan stalked to the shed. Inside, the aroma of wet peat earth filled the air, while flowers erupted from cold-hardy bulbs in rectangular planters and winter-tender plants snuggled close together on top of plant heating mats. The shed was Rosalind\u2019s \u201cbaby\u201d nursery, and she defended the place with wolfish fierceness\u2014nothing could be changed without her permission.</p><p>Not that he minded. He was glad she had an occupation she so thoroughly enjoyed and that kept her out of his business\u2014for the most part\u2014and out of trouble. He quickly removed his shirt, boots, socks, and jeans, and then deposited them on a small wooden bench. The brisk cold chilled him to the bone. Which helped to freeze his thoughts of Carol Wood and her inquisitive blue eyes.</p><p>Then, his muscles heated with the change, stretching and accommodating the shift swiftly until he was standing on all four paws, the double coat of fur warming him better than any human-made coat could.</p> <p>The shorter, fine fuzzy undercoat trapped a layer of warm air next to his skin, while the longer, coarse guard hairs repelled any hint of frost or snow or rain. Long tufts of hair growing between the pads of his feet gave him a good grip as he raced across the thin sheen of ice already covering the back patio while circling the place to make sure Rosalind would be all right. Although his deputy had told him he\u2019d hang around to check on her two or three times a day.</p><p>Hell, Ryan had enough work to do here, and none of it included taking on the problems of a newly turned female. So why was he really bound for Darien Silver\u2019s territory after a quick run in his wolf coat?</p><p>Ryan cursed his unwanted desire to be with the woman again, but after taking a run on the wild side and ensuring that everything was quiet around his place, he didn\u2019t feel any more settled. He changed in the garden shed, returned to the house, and gave his sister a hug with a few choice words of instruction. She eagerly agreed to follow them, which made him suspect she wouldn\u2019t. Then he hurried to his truck.</p><p>Darien had dictated that he sleep in the sunroom on a sofa bed. How was Ryan going to protect Carol if he slept on the other side of the house?</p><p>He\u2019d have to twist the rules. His job\u2014his way.</p><p>\u201cJust who\u2019s paying Ryan to be Carol\u2019s bodyguard?\u201d Darien asked Lelandi as he paced across the master bedroom down the hall. Carol heard a hint of wry humor in his tone as she pulled off her clothes in the private bathroom adjoining her guestroom.</p><p>Carol hated that her sense of hearing was so good that she could make out every word\u2014muffled but still audible if they spoke loud enough. She figured most werewolves tuned out conversations they didn\u2019t want to listen to. But she wasn\u2019t able to do that yet, especially when the conversation was about her. That made her feel as though she was another Silva, overhearing exchanges that she wasn\u2019t meant to hear.</p><p>\u201cDarien, Carol is willing to pay for his services, but it\u2019s our place to do so since the red in our territory most likely was from my old pack. So my responsibility, which means yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need an outsider bodyguard,\u201d Darien grouched. Now he sounded annoyed. \u201cWhat is it with McKinley anyway? He\u2019s acting mayor of Green Valley, now full-time active pack leader, and he\u2019s still haunting our town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a thing for Carol. Surely you see that as well as anyone here does.\u201d</p><p>Darien growled.</p><p>\u201cWhat if he\u2019s the right one for her? I mean, Jake or Tom could be, but they haven\u2019t shown anything more than brotherly affection for her. Tom\u2019s more protective and Jake delights in teasing her, yet he\u2019d protect her with his life. But Ryan... well, you saw the way he danced with her. And before that, the way he came to her rescue when Mervin tackled her. I didn\u2019t get to see it, but Silva said they shared some kiss outside by the house. You know how she is. She\u2019s an alpha. She needs someone who\u2019s strong of character like she is. Ryan would make a good match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have plenty of pack members who would make her a good match. An alpha werewolf doesn\u2019t have to have an alpha mate. For all we know, she might need a man that she can boss around.\u201d The floor creaked some more with his pacing. \u201cAll right, so McKinley comes here to fortify our forces, but it irritates the hell out of me that he thinks our men can\u2019t protect her. I\u2019m only allowing this because you wish it.\u201d</p><p>No more words were spoken. No need to eavesdrop any longer.</p><p>Carol started the shower and turned on some New Age music. Next would come the lovemaking. At least the shower and music drowned out the moans and groans.</p><p>Carol climbed into the shower and closed her eyes as the hot water sluiced over her skin. Was Lelandi right in thinking Ryan was truly interested in her? The sexual interest was there, that was for sure. Every time she got close to him, her blood sizzled. Her heart pounded at an increased tempo.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t just her response to him. His actions triggered her hormones to skip around in an excited frenzy. The way he observed her\u2014although she had to remind herself he was probably trying to figure her out\u2014and the way his gaze filled with admiration at times, lust at others, she knew she had more of an effect on him than he was letting on.</p><p>Even if they weren\u2019t a match, she was determined to prove to him, while he served as her bodyguard, that her psychic abilities were real. She shouldn\u2019t have cared if he believed her or not. She imagined that more than half of the world\u2019s population didn\u2019t have faith in such things. But she did care that he believed. That he knew she had been honest with him.</p><p>She grabbed the container of liquid body soap and squeezed some into her hand. Then she slid the pearl-like soap over her shoulders, breasts, and stomach.</p><p>A distinctive thump sounded nearby, muffled by the water rushing in a heavy spray out of the showerhead. Darien dropping a boot on his bedroom floor? It sounded like it had come from her guestroom, though. She listened intently but didn\u2019t hear anything further except for the continued stream of water shlushing out of the showerhead and the mystical New Age rhythm of drumbeats, flutes, and pipe whistles. Had to have been Darien or Lelandi making a noise. Or just her imagination.</p><p>She ran shampoo through her hair and over her face, the scent of peaches filling her nostrils with the sweet, refreshing fragrance. Her fingers swept the silky soap down her arms.</p><p>After that, everything happened so quickly that it was a blur. The rings of the shower curtain slid aside. The cooler air from the bathroom hit her wet skin. The smell of the onions and garlic the intruder had eaten permeated the air, right before a painful jab penetrated her arm. Her eyes and mouth shot open. Soap burned her eyes, tears forming instantly to wash away the stinging but further blurring her vision. A heavy hand clamped over her mouth to muffle her scream.</p><p>Heat quickly spread through her blood, and she felt as if she were slipping into nothingness. The hot water still ran over her, her eyes burning, and whispered words penetrating the darkness as someone held her tight. The smell of man and woods, of sweat and fear clouded her senses.</p><p>\u201cAsleep. Let\u2019s get her out of here before we get caught,\u201d the man said in a rush, his voice hushed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t recognize his harsh and concerned voice. Her last thought was to wonder where her bodyguard was when she needed him so badly. Damn Darien for forcing Ryan to sleep in the sunroom on the other side of the house. If he\u2019d even returned from Green Valley to watch over her yet. But she\u2019d heard Lelandi arguing with Darien once they\u2019d returned home from the tavern. Heard that Darien hadn\u2019t wanted Ryan in the same room with her. That it would stir up the other bachelor males. That it would encourage Ryan to want Carol for a mate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once they discovered she was missing, it would be too late.</p><p>She would have fought her kidnappers\u2019 confinement, if she could have oriented herself in this new world. But all she saw was blackness, no wolf\u2019s vision here. And all she felt was numbness spreading through every inch of her body. Huffing and puffing and grunting, not her own, filled her ears.</p><p>A jolt to her body and an abrupt change from cool air to frigid air startled her. Her wet, soapy body grew goose bumps as a chilly breeze whipped across her sticky, water-soaked hair, still coated in shampoo, and her naked skin. The biting cold encased her as silky red hair floated over her face. Her eyes filled with tears and soap, she briefly saw a blurry image of amber eyes narrowed as they looked down at her\u2014a concerned-looking man with the start of a scraggily beard. Then she succumbed to a tiredness from which she couldn\u2019t free herself. Vaguely, it was as if she was seeing the vision she\u2019d witnessed in Ryan\u2019s truck outside the tavern all over again. Only the cold was too real.</p> <p>She floated, was jostled, and heard the crunching of footsteps in the dark and the heavy breathing and hard-charging heartbeats that revealed her kidnappers\u2019 panic. One of the men held her tight against his body, his chest covered in a padded vest that made him feel cuddly, not hard and strong. Clothed in flannel, his arms also felt soft.</p><p>She wanted to bury herself deeply in every part of him that felt warm wherever he touched her. His warmth helped to heat her body, but she felt as limp as a chilled, soaked noodle. She tried to open her eyes to get a better look at the man, but they stung from the soap and she barely opened them. Her eyes were too blurry with tears for her to see anything. Her head felt empty and floated separately from her body.</p><p>Then it hit her\u2014although she wasn\u2019t sure whether it was a vision of something to come or a nightmare, or a little of both. She couldn\u2019t tell as her mind slipped into another reality induced by the drug.</p><p>Jake paced in his wolf form through the great room after a jaunt in the night with several others. Only he hadn\u2019t changed back. None of them had changed back. Carol watched helplessly. Lelandi\u2019s green eyes pleaded with her to do something. Anything. But what could Carol do? Just warn their kind not to shift. And look at how well that had worked! Damn it!</p><p>Then the world faded into something else. A room she\u2019d never seen before came into view. A big-screen TV clung to the wall. And the walls: the upper half-sunny and lighted with fan-shaped brass sconces to give the illusion of light, and the lower half covered in light oak paneling. The room had no windows. No windows, as if buried in the bowels of the earth.</p> <p>Rich brown leather sofas and a light brown rug added to the earthy tones. A man\u2019s room, she thought. But something wasn\u2019t right. Bright lights from another room intruded on the soft lighting in this one. With the greatest apprehension, she moved without moving toward the doorway bathed in brilliant white.</p><p>Someone was in there. Shadows crossed the doorway briefly as someone moved about, blocking the light marginally. She had to see into the room. Had to see who the someone was.</p><p>Two shots rang out.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d From a great distance, Sam shattered the future world Carol was in. Instantly her thoughts became her own again, except that she couldn\u2019t remember what had happened, where she was, or what she was doing. Shots had been fired. Hadn\u2019t they?</p><p>The cold shook her from the fogginess\u2014the shower, the soap, the kidnappers! She opened her mouth to speak, to call out, to get Sam\u2019s attention.</p><p>Shots rang out. Shots fired from close by. From the kidnappers. At Sam.</p> <p>The acrid smell of gun smoke drifted to her.</p><p>Her mouth snapped shut. Silver bullets? She couldn\u2019t be the cause of Sam\u2019s death. Best to let the villains take her away.</p><p>\u201cRaise the alarm!\u201d Sam shouted.</p><p>The man carrying her swore under his breath and tightened his hold on her, stumbling at a slightly faster pace.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s happening?\u201d Darien asked, growing closer to Sam\u2019s voice.</p><p>They were coming for her. The sensation that she was one of the pack gave her some peace of mind, but the danger the gunman posed if Sam and Darien caught up with her was too great to ignore. The bullets would kill Darien and Sam and any others who got too close. They couldn\u2019t risk it. Don\u2019t risk it!</p><p>\u201cThree men running that way. They\u2019ve got Carol!\u201d Sam shouted back to him. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve got guns!\u201d</p><p>Another shot rang out and Carol tried to squirm, but not a muscle obeyed her.</p> <p>\u201cCarol!\u201d Darien shouted.</p><p>She tried to speak, to shout, but she had no voice.</p><p>Suddenly she felt herself falling, dropped like a sack of cold groceries. She should have felt a hard impact, but her body didn\u2019t feel anything but a slight jolt. Now she was left in the sweet-smelling grass, crispy with frost, to freeze to death. She curled up into a fetal ball, trying to get warm, when a large hand gripped her shoulder and she shuddered. They weren\u2019t leaving her behind after all. At once, she felt an odd mix of reprieve and regret.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive,\u201d he said, his voice low and dark but comforting.</p><p>Ryan? A sense of overwhelming relief washed over her. And a fuzzy question surfaced. When had he returned from Green Valley? She envisioned him racing to the rescue on a white steed while he wore the McKinley plaid, the kilt reaching his knees, sword belted at his waist, a shirt open to his collarbone, his face frowning as he scooped her up from the cold ground and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her!\u201d Ryan wrapped her in something warm and soft that smelled of him, his distinctive male scent of fresh soap and heat. Of spices and the wind in the firs, of the wild. Was it his plaid? She imagined him now wearing only the long shirt that reached mid-thigh and sturdy leather boots that met his knees, his expression worried and stern.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked, lifting her off the cold ground. He jostled her as he ran, his arms so tight around her that she felt he was going to crush her. But the heat and his protectiveness comforted her.</p><p>And when they reached the laird\u2019s castle, he was going to kiss her and tell her how much he loved her, how he couldn\u2019t live without her. She would be a member of his clan as they would want her to join them. Despite her being a MacDonald. Did the McKinley clan fight with the MacDonalds? She didn\u2019t know but fervently hoped not.</p><p>\u201cCarol, can you focus?\u201d His darkened eyes studied her for a moment as he rushed toward their destination.</p><p>She parted her lips, couldn\u2019t get a word out, closed her eyes, and concentrated on him and the way he held her so... so possessively.</p><p>He squeezed her tight again and kissed her lips gently, which got her attention. As soon as she opened her eyes, even as blurry as her vision was, she saw his lips curve slightly upward, but his brow was still furrowed in a deep frown.</p><p>After what seemed like forever, his feet tromped on wooden steps\u2014when she thought they should have been stone\u2014and then inside. She felt the warmth of the castle keep and smelled the scent of apple pies coming from the kitchen far away.</p><p>\u201cOhmigod... Carol. Is she all right?\u201d Lelandi asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi? The Highland romance Carol was living instantly died, and she remembered the pies Lelandi, Silva, and she had made after returning from the tavern and her date with Ryan.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s been drugged. She\u2019s not said a word since I found her. She can barely open her eyes, and she is limp and unresponsive.\u201d Ryan rushed through the house.</p><p>Carol smelled the scent of the roses on the mantel as they passed them. Felt his legs lift, his thighs bumping her back as he ascended the stairs. What was she wrapped in, if not his plaid?</p><p>\u201cWhere were you when Sam raised the alarm?\u201d Lelandi\u2019s words were spoken close behind him, her footfalls on the carpeted stairs lighter but just as hurried.</p><p>\u201cI was searching the woods out back when I heard gunfire and Sam\u2019s yelling. When I drew too close to her kidnappers, they must have heard me coming and dropped her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Carol.\u201d Lelandi\u2019s voice was clearly shaken. \u201cTake her to her room. I\u2019ll call Doc.\u201d</p><p>Then the hazy world seemed to fade away. Carol was safe and home for the moment with the man of her dreams. And free.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>RYAN HUGGED CAROL TIGHTER AS HER SLIGHTLY TENSE body seemed to lose all strength again. He\u2019d gotten Darien\u2019s approval to stay and guard her, but damn if Darien had said he\u2019d stay in the sunroom, which was too far from Carol\u2019s bedroom to be any help. Although he\u2019d planned to sit in the recliner in her room later that night anyway. If he couldn\u2019t serve as her bodyguard in the way he felt would offer her the right amount of protection, there was no sense in his being here.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t been searching around the grounds outside before he retired for the evening, he\u2019d never have heard the men take off with her on the other side of the rambling two-story house in time. And if he hadn\u2019t nearly reached them to identify them by sight, they wouldn\u2019t have dropped her and left her behind, he was fairly certain. For that, he was grateful.</p><p>\u201cCarol, can you hear me? It\u2019s me, Ryan,\u201d he said, his voice soothing, wanting her to know it was him and not one of the men who had taken her hostage.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, stirring a little.</p><p>As little as it was, he was still glad to hear her response. \u201cUntil Doc gets over here with something to counteract the sedative they used on you, you\u2019re going to feel pretty out of it. Your skin and hair are caked with soap, and Lelandi doesn\u2019t have the strength to wash you in the shower. A bath would take too long to prepare, not the way you\u2019re shivering. I\u2019ll have to wash you in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>He took that as a yes, although they hadn\u2019t any other choice.</p><p>When he reached the bathroom, the shower had been turned off, but the room was thick with warm moisture, the mirrors steamed, the scent of sweet peaches still lingering in the air. He lay Carol down on a towel on the tiled floor, but as soon as he released her, she reached her hands slightly up to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, Carol,\u201d he coaxed, squeezing her hands, hating to have to leave her unattended for even a second when she didn\u2019t seem to understand what was going on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he released her again and turned on the hot water. Once he had stripped out of everything but his boxers and when the water temperature felt right, he unwrapped her from his goose-down jacket and lifted her in his arms.</p><p>She shivered, and he squeezed her tightly against his body as he climbed into the tub.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to set you down, wash the soap off, and then dry you and put you into bed. Doc will be here soon.\u201d</p> <p>Lelandi hurried into the bathroom. \u201cWhat will the other bachelors think?\u201d Her tone was more amused than alarmed. She eyed him as he stood in only his boxers with a naked Carol in his arms. \u201cHere, let me help,\u201d she said, reaching out to grab Carol\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her,\u201d Ryan said, setting Carol down in the tub, not wanting Lelandi to do any heavy lifting in her condition.</p><p>Lelandi handed him the handheld showerhead, and he washed Carol\u2019s face and hair, the spray wetting him also. \u201cShe\u2019s probably got soap in her eyes. If I can\u2019t get her to open them, Doc will have to flush them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s unable to come. He said the drug should wear off. Silva will pick up some medicine that will help counter the sedative. Doc\u2019s got three cases of swine flu and a human boy whose brother accidentally broke his nose playing basketball with him, and one of the pregnant humans is in labor now, so he has to remain at the hospital. Nurses Charlotte and Matthew are busy helping him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have been with her. Those bastards would have never gotten near her.\u201d Ryan lifted Carol\u2019s chin and applied a steady stream of water to her face.</p> <p>Lelandi grabbed a towel from the nearby rack. \u201cI\u2019m sure Darien will agree now to allow you to stay close to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little late,\u201d Ryan muttered. From now on, he would do this his way.</p><p>\u201cI feel the same way, but you know Darien. You\u2019re an outsider.\u201d Lelandi handed Ryan a warm, wet washcloth. \u201cHe still wanted one of his bachelor males to woo her. Now you\u2019re becoming a real obstacle to his plans.\u201d</p><p>His own feelings mixed on the subject, Ryan wasn\u2019t about to reveal his thoughts on the matter. \u201cHow do you feel about what he thinks?\u201d When she didn\u2019t respond, Ryan looked back at Lelandi and noted the wry amusement on her face. He shook his head. \u201cJake or Tom would make tolerable mates for her but not the beta males.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Lelandi asked softly.</p><p>With the rush of the shower as he ran the water over Carol\u2019s hair, he almost didn\u2019t hear Lelandi\u2019s words. \u201cI\u2019m here to do a job. Serve as her bodyguard. That\u2019s all.\u201d Yet even as he spoke the words, he didn\u2019t feel sincere in the least.</p> <p>He gently washed Carol\u2019s eyes, finished rinsing out her hair, and ran the water over her face again and down her body, where a sheen of soap still covered her skin and goose bumps raised. It would take a saint not to notice her soft feminine curves, her vulnerability, and her beauty.</p><p>But he was trying his damnedest to keep his wolfish thoughts at bay, just as he knew she had when she\u2019d observed him after he\u2019d shifted and remarked, You look nice and healthy to me. He\u2019d seen the admiration in her gaze, noticed she\u2019d taken a gander twice at his size, and wasn\u2019t fooled by her pretense. Not when he heard her heart beating rapidly and saw the faint blush tinge her cheeks beautifully.</p><p>Her eyes suddenly blinked, and she squinted.</p><p>His heart hammering, he lifted her chin gently. If he hadn\u2019t had an audience, he would have kissed her lips, maybe enticing her to open her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cCan you do that again, Carol? Open your eyes so I can wash the soap out?\u201d</p><p>She tried, but she could barely lift her lids, her face grimacing. Then she went completely limp again, deep in drug-induced sleep.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very good with her,\u201d Lelandi said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m used to helping victims of crimes.\u201d Although he wasn\u2019t capable of feeling impersonal in this case. Not when Carol was naked and so defenseless. Crouching in front of her, he squeezed the water out of her hair with one hand, his other holding her shoulder to keep her from sliding.</p> <p>\u201cAh, and the kiss you shared with her earlier before the gathering?\u201d</p><p>What could he say about that? A mistake? Was dancing too damn close to her at the gathering also a mistake? No, none of it was. Just some errant need to get closer, to possess, to quash his compulsion to learn how she scrambled his thoughts to such a degree. To show her he thought she was much more intriguing than the other women at the gathering. Hell, maybe she did have psychic abilities. The kind that included mind control.</p><p>Many of his Scottish ancestors believed in witches in the old days, many of the women having practiced the healing arts in their unusual ways. Carol was a nurse and had ancestral ties to the Highlands of Scotland, so maybe some of her ancestors were among those healers and she had inherited their genes. He shook his head at himself for even going there.</p><p>\u201cWant to turn off the water?\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything in response to Lelandi\u2019s question, figuring she had already decided he was hooked on Little Miss Nightingale. Not that she wasn\u2019t desirable as hell, but she really needed someone who could completely believe in her.</p><p>Lelandi handed him an oversized fluffy white towel. The cloth contrasted sharply with Carol\u2019s skin, flushed from the heat of the shower, as he wrapped the towel around her.</p><p>\u201cCan you get something for her to wear other than that silky see-through nightgown?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s brows shot up as she handed him a towel for Carol\u2019s hair. \u201cHow do you know what she wears at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was standing in the window watching me in the woods. Hard not to notice.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s lips parted. Then in silence, she shook her head and left the bathroom, while Ryan wrapped Carol\u2019s hair in the second towel and then lifted her from the tub.</p><p>Carrying Carol into her bedroom, he saw Lelandi holding up the shimmering translucent nightgown he\u2019d seen Carol wear the night before. It reminded him of the silken goddess standing in the window, staring out at him, as beguiling as ever.</p><p>\u201cGuess she\u2019s not used to sleeping naked like the rest of us yet. She\u2019s got some other nightgowns, but all are shorter and more revealing,\u201d Lelandi said.</p><p>Carol looked small and sleepy in his arms, and beautiful. But the idea of her lying naked or wearing that silken piece of nightwear or anything even shorter and more revealing as she slept next to him in bed tightened his groin even further.</p><p>\u201cDoes she have sweats? A long T-shirt?\u201d Damn, considering anything she might wear made him think of her as sexy as hell.</p><p>Lelandi glanced down at Ryan\u2019s soaking-wet boxers. \u201cDon\u2019t let Darien see you like that.\u201d</p><p>How could he help it if rinsing off Carol\u2019s naked body had left him hard as steel? Even though he\u2019d done his damnedest to keep his efforts as professional as possible. He was only human and a lot wolf, after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat made Darien realize she\u2019d been kidnapped?\u201d he asked, resting Carol in the bed.</p><p>Lelandi held out a light blue T-shirt. He helped Lelandi pull it over Carol\u2019s head. When they stretched it down Carol\u2019s body, it barely covered her feminine enticements.</p><p>Lelandi slid the comforter up to Carol\u2019s shoulders. \u201cJake was still up, editing his photos of wildflowers on his computer.\u201d</p><p>Ryan raised his brows.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jake\u2019s hobby. Sam was watching him work, but both thought they heard something bump against the side of the house. Sam ran outside, while Jake tore up the stairs to check on Carol. He found her shower on and a trail of water leading to the window. The men had used a ladder and left it there. Outside the house, Sam smelled the reds and a perfumed soap that lingered in the air. The same shampoo that Carol uses. Jake alerted Darien, and I woke Tom. And here you are, her knight to the rescue.\u201d</p><p>Hell, if he\u2019d been a true knight, he wouldn\u2019t have allowed her to be taken in the first place.</p><p>Ryan glanced at the bedroom door. He realized then that there was no sound of anyone else in the house, no evidence that the group chasing Carol\u2019s kidnappers had returned. Which wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll dry her hair. You get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re alone? Just you, Carol, and me?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat if the men had tried to take you also while everyone left you alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got big teeth if anyone is of a mind to show up who doesn\u2019t belong here. I called the sheriff and his deputy, and they\u2019re on their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, that\u2019s not soon enough. And these guys have guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard. What is the world coming to?\u201d Lelandi sounded flippant, but her worried look belied her true feelings as she hooked up a blow-dryer and began running the hot air over Carol\u2019s hair.</p><p>Ryan watched Lelandi comb her fingers gently through the damp strands the way he had done when he rinsed the soap out. Silky blonde curls turned from wet and dark to soft spun gold, and he thought of how it would feel to run his fingers through her hair when it was dry.</p><p>Shaking loose of the notion, he headed into the bathroom to strip out of his boxers. \u201cAt least three men were out there. Maybe four. See if you can recognize any of their scents tomorrow when it\u2019s daylight and you have plenty of protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>Sam barged into the bedroom and gave Ryan a disparaging look. \u201cHell, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was drugged.\u201d Ryan dried off and jerked on his jeans in the bathroom. \u201cDid anyone catch any of the bastards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Darien and his brothers shape-shifted and are tracking them. He sent me back to help you guard the women in case the men doubled back and returned to the house.\u201d Sam walked over to the bedroom window and peered out.</p><p>\u201cThink they were shooting silver bullets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight have been. Reds wouldn\u2019t be a match for us grays.\u201d Sam turned around to look at Ryan and frowned. \u201cWhere were you that you got to Carol so quickly?\u201d</p><p>Ryan grabbed his shirt. \u201cOutside. I\u2019d already circled the grounds once, and then I thought I heard whispered voices on the other side of the house headed for the woods. I came from a different direction than you and Darien. Since you were shouting and I was in stealth mode, they didn\u2019t hear me coming until it was almost too late. They dropped their precious cargo and hightailed it out of here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn good thing, too.\u201d</p><p>The sound of footfalls coming into the house through the back door caught their attention. Sam stormed out of the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cLock the door,\u201d Ryan warned Lelandi. Ready to shift and take care of the threat, he dropped his shirt on the end of the bed and took off after Sam.</p> <p>As soon as they made it down the stairs, they saw Darien and his brothers stalking into the great room. \u201cThey shifted and took off,\u201d Darien said, his brow furrowed, his face red. \u201cWhere are Carol and Lelandi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol\u2019s sedated and sleeping in her room. Lelandi\u2019s with her,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI\u2019m staying with Carol until we catch the bastards.\u201d</p><p>Jake growled, \u201cYou don\u2019t tell a pack leader what he\u2019s going to allow, not in his own territory, McKinley.\u201d</p><p>Ryan suspected Jake was angrier about them losing the men who had taken Carol than that Ryan was making the rules in his brother\u2019s territory. \u201cI\u2019m not budging on this.\u201d</p><p>Darien looked at how underdressed Ryan was, and his own scowl deepened. \u201cWhere the hell are the rest of your clothes? You didn\u2019t shape-shift out there, did you?\u201d</p> <p>Ryan had only managed to get his jeans on. Boxers were soaking wet, lying in the tub. Boots, socks, and a soapy down jacket remained on the bathroom floor, while his shirt was draped across the foot of the bed. No time for anything else when he thought the bad guys were storming the house and he might have to shift to take care of the menace.</p><p>Sam motioned to the stairs. \u201cHe had to wash the soap off Carol. But Lelandi was with him the whole time.\u201d</p><p>Although Sam hadn\u2019t really known what had gone on, Ryan appreciated the backup. But Darien glowered at Ryan, waiting for him to give his version.</p><p>\u201cHell, Darien, soap caked Carol\u2019s hair and covered her body. She had soap in her eyes even. Lelandi couldn\u2019t have managed washing her. What did you expect me to do? Leave her like that until you returned? As for guarding her until we catch these bastards? I\u2019m staying with her, and that\u2019s my final word.\u201d</p><p>Darien\u2019s scowl evaporated some. \u201cAs a bodyguard only. You can sit in the recliner at night and nap during the day. I\u2019ll have others watch her while you catch up on your sleep.\u201d Darien marched off to the stairs.</p><p>Tom glowered at Ryan and then headed up the stairs after his brother.</p> <p>Sam moved toward the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m getting myself another cup of coffee, and I\u2019ll settle down here.\u201d</p><p>Jake eyed Ryan for a moment more and then said, \u201cDarien doesn\u2019t like it that you want Carol for a mate. Bodyguard, my ass. Admit it, Ryan. You can\u2019t quit thinking about her. But you can\u2019t have her if you don\u2019t believe in her abilities. Just remember that. She deserves better.\u201d</p><p>He stalked off to join Sam in the kitchen.</p><p>Jake was right, of course. The thing of it was, no matter how much Ryan told himself psychics weren\u2019t for real, he couldn\u2019t help questioning his rigid beliefs. Hell, now he wanted to believe her more than he wanted to prove she didn\u2019t have second sight.</p><p>So when did that happen?</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>CAROL DRIFTED IN AND OUT OF NIGHTMARE WORLDS OF wolves and fighting, of teeth bared, growling and snarling, and of hackles raised, noses wrinkled, and amber eyes narrowed. Of the painful bite that changed her life forever. And then as if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, she relived the pain jabbing her in the arm, the freezing cold and sticky wetness, her eyes burning, and exposure, naked to the spring chill.</p><p>A whimper escaped her lips, and strong arms pulled her to a hot, hard body. She tried to recall when she\u2019d felt those arms wrapped around her last in her drug- induced foggy conscience. She remembered hurried footfalls, the aroma of apple pies still lingering in the air... home. And... Ryan. That\u2019s who had taken her from the cold and held her close, heating her chilled skin with his warm clothing and with his even hotter body. And now?</p> <p>She smelled his unique scent, his maleness, the wind in his hair, the peach soap on his skin. Her peach soap? Had he showered using her shampoo?</p><p>No. She vaguely remembered him trying to rinse the soap from her eyes. The burning misery. She\u2019d tried to cooperate. She really had tried. But her eyes had stung too much to oblige. Her brain had turned to mush again, and she\u2019d slipped into darkness with no way out.</p><p>Then Lelandi had spoken softly to her, the noisy hair dryer nearly drowning out her words as Carol had tried to hear them. \u201cYou\u2019re a match, dear Carol. You just need to ensure Ryan sees it before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>It was already too late. How could Carol love someone who didn\u2019t trust in her abilities? Who believed she was lying? Or was just too dumb to know the truth?</p><p>She recalled the onions and garlic, the smell of the man who had kidnapped her, the feeling of hopelessness, of wanting to fight him off but being unable to. She tried to wriggle free and whimpered softly, attempting to cry out, to tell Darien and his brothers and Sam where she was. But then the crackle of gunfire sounded and she gave a small gasp.</p><p>\u201cShh, Carol, you\u2019re safe. In your bedroom. With me, Ryan. You\u2019re safe. Sleep.\u201d Ryan\u2019s words were sleepy, soothing, and masculine. His arms wrapped tighter around her, anchoring her to him, her lifeline, her protection.</p><p>She took a deep breath of him, blocking out all other memories and settling against his solid form. She felt a whisper of his warm breath against her hair and knew that if heaven existed, this was it. Maybe it wasn\u2019t too late. Maybe she could convince the stubborn man of science to open his mind to another world.</p><p>She cuddled with him, his solid chest pillowing her head, his heart thumping with a steady beat against her ear, the heat of his body warming hers. His hand stroked down her back, lightly, tenderly in a comforting way. She purred like Puss, mesmerized with Ryan\u2019s gentle touch. And could have stayed like this forever.</p><p>Hell, Ryan really was trying to be a gentleman here, but the way Carol\u2019s fingers spread across his chest with a feather-light touch, the way she snuggled closer to him, one leg slipping over his, the way she softly purred like a kitten in ecstasy, he was having the damnedest time keeping their relationship strictly impersonal.</p><p>Her T-shirt had risen again, and her soft naked belly was pressed against his hip, her bare leg touching his thigh. Was she still so out of it from the drug that she had no inhibitions? Or did she really want him, like he was dying to have her?</p><p>He let out his breath in a heavy sigh. His job was to guard her body, not ravish it. After what she\u2019d been through last night and five months ago, she needed to feel secure and protected. So why the hell did he have to keep reminding himself of that?</p><p>Maybe because her silky smooth leg had slid up his thigh even further and was pressing lightly against his arousal. That\u2019s why.</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond. He figured she was asleep and wasn\u2019t even aware she was putting him through all this torture. He kissed the top of her head and closed his eyes, trying to will himself to sleep for what was left of the early morning hours. Like that was going to happen while he kept his arm wrapped around the half-naked siren and she clung intimately to him.</p><p>The issues of her psychic business were quickly taking a backseat to his desire to have her\u2014as a wolf would have his mate.</p><p>But then, Carol\u2019s fingers teased his chest more than once, and he was sure she was waking up or already fully awake.</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d he whispered again.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she finally said, and cuddled closer. \u201cDo you ever wish you were human?\u201d she asked softly, almost as if she was afraid to propose the question.</p><p>Ryan raised her face and gave her a dark smile. \u201cI am human. What\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with those beautiful blue eyes, questioning, enticing. \u201cI just wondered if you ever wanted to have sex with a werewolf but couldn\u2019t because then you\u2019d be mated for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted to have sex with her, I\u2019d want her for life.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s fingers swept across his heated skin again in a tantalizing caress, and now that she was awake and fully aware that he was with her nearly naked and not in the least bit bothered by their close proximity and intimacy\u2014</p><p>\u201cWell if you were human\u2014all the way\u2014you could have a werewolf lover with no consequences,\u201d she continued, her words still spoken in a hush, as if she didn\u2019t want the world to know she was awake or that she was speaking to Ryan or even what she was speaking about.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>She rested against him in silence for some time, as he stroked her soft hair, his body hardening, his desire for her growing, despite his efforts to keep his burgeoning craving to have her in check. She wasn\u2019t making it easy. Considering her quickening heartbeat and the subtle changes in the sweet scent of her, the hint of arousal\u2014and even the way she touched him and stroked him softly, playing with him\u2014she had to be feeling something for him also.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how Sam and Silva do it,\u201d she said under her breath.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d He could guess where this was going, and he was instantly interested, as long as she knew what she was getting into and was just as willing.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what, Carol? You brought it up,\u201d he pressed, hoping he wouldn\u2019t scare her off with his enthusiasm.</p><p>She cleared her throat and whispered, \u201cAs hot and heavy as the petting is getting between them even in public, I wonder how they can hold back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean that they\u2019ve already done it? Consummated the relationship? Are secretly mated?\u201d</p><p>His fingers paused on her hair. \u201cThey\u2019d let everyone know if they\u2019d mated. No, I\u2019d say they haven\u2019t quite gotten there yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She had to have gotten the picture.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly acceptable.\u201d He wanted to push her onto her back to demonstrate just how far werewolves could go with one another before being committed as mates, but he was still afraid she wasn\u2019t ready. \u201cWe aren\u2019t talking about Sam and Silva here, are we?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her face flushed with color, and her fingers grew still.</p><p>\u201cI have to admit I\u2019m a bit surprised. But not in the least bit... unwilling.\u201d When she didn\u2019t respond, he thought he\u2019d scared her off, that she hadn\u2019t had that in mind, that she was only curious about Sam and Silva\u2019s situation. He had to admit that because she was newly turned, werewolf relationships might still be a mystery to her. And he felt a bit of a cad, believing she had wanted him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything for so long and was so still\u2014barely breathing, her heart still beating at an increased cadence\u2014that he wasn\u2019t sure how to rectify the situation.</p><p>Before he could speak, she whispered, \u201cSomeone might hear us.\u201d</p><p>If he could have, he would have whisked her away to somewhere private, away from Darien, his own family, and the world. But, if she was willing... hell, who was he not to satisfy her cravings?</p><p>That\u2019s when he rolled her onto her back and captured her mouth with his, intending to kiss her so thoroughly that she wouldn\u2019t be able to make a sound. The only thing he regretted was that they didn\u2019t have time to luxuriate in the feel of each other, to make the experience last.</p><p>But she seemed to be of like mind and parted her lips for him, opening to the curl of his tongue as he seduced hers with his, her fingers sifting through his hair, his hands holding her face in place, his thumbs stroking her cheeks. A soft moan escaped her throat, spurring him on.</p><p>Feral and ardent, from the moment their lips and tongues touched, he felt his blood sizzle with heat and desire. His arousal pressed against her waist, and she released his hair and swept her hands down his naked back, skin to skin, her touch leaving a fiery wake in their path. With his mouth greedy on hers and her response just as fiercely passionate, he felt her nipples beneath her cotton T-shirt bud against his chest, hard, tantalizing, aroused.</p><p>He meant to move aside her so he could cup a breast and feel the delectable nipple, but she spread her legs, and he found himself resting between them, a dangerous invitation to sex and consummation and mating.</p><p>And for the first time, he truly wanted it. With her. For all time. But she wasn\u2019t ready. Not yet. Maybe never.</p><p>Her lithe body arched beneath him, pressing against him to solicit his touching that most intimate of all spots. He swallowed a deep-seated groan and tried to keep his thoughts intact. No consummation. Just pleasure, even if it killed him.</p><p>He moved over, straddling her soft leg, still trapping her, leaning against the mattress so he could pull off her shirt. And when he\u2019d freed her of the fabric, he caressed her now swollen breasts, which were flushed, the nipples like dark cherries begging for a kiss. His tongue teased one, and she closed her eyes and clamped her teeth shut against another moan.</p><p>And then his fingers dipped into her sweet sheath, hot, wet, erotic, but he quickly silenced another of her moans with a deepening kiss. Her fingers dug into his buttocks still covered in cotton boxers, her body writhing against his fingers, arching, pleading for resolution. His fingers continued to ply her with caresses, stroking, then thrusting inside her, while he watched her shuttered gaze and parted lips, heard her shallow breaths, and felt her fingers clinging to him.</p><p>Unable to help himself, he rubbed the erection straining in his boxers against her soft naked thigh. Bone-hard, wanting, thrusting, he felt burned to the core by white-hot heat as he pressed for deliverance.</p><p>Carol absorbed every feel of him, from the way his fingers worked miracles on her nub to his erection thrusting against her thigh. God, she wanted him inside her where everything had turned to aching, molten lava. She craved release and begged for it, pushed him to hurry and finish it before she died an exquisite death from wanting. Without being able to hold onto the rising tide of pleasure, she came, the climax filling her with a rush of satisfaction, her breath ragged, her body hot and flushed and sweaty\u2014and sweetly satiated.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s face was dark and flushed, his breath hurried, his eyes smoky brown, and his heart beating as if he\u2019d run for miles as a wolf. She exhilarated in the feel of his touch, his wildness, yet gentleness, too, the fact he wanted to pleasure her and would keep it quiet.</p><p>He was the hero of her dreams, the fantasy in the novels she so loved to read, the kilted warrior who\u2019d somehow lost his kilt and wore instead a pair of boxers. Which wasn\u2019t right. A Highlander went without. She slipped her fingers down his backside and underneath his waistband and squeezed his buttocks, soliciting a groan from his lips.</p><p>But then she tugged at his boxers, and he hurried to slide them off. Then he was all hers. She ran her hand over his rigid length and felt it jump in her hands, tightened and stroked and smiled as he reached up to kiss her lips. But he was already so primed that he couldn\u2019t last. With another stroke, she sent him reeling, and he came. She continued to stroke and marvel in the way he reacted, his eyes clouded with lust, his body jerking with completion, his calling her name in a husky whisper as if she was the one sent to save him.</p><p>He kissed her as if he never wanted to stop, his tongue again stroking hers, his hand caressing her jaw, her throat, her breastbone, her breast.</p><p>And then he groaned one last time, collapsed beside her on his back, and pulled her into his arms. They lay together in perfect bliss for what seemed like an eternity, floating, satiated, and warm in each other\u2019s embrace.</p><p>\u201cHave fresh sheets?\u201d he finally whispered, his voice hoarse.</p><p>She frowned. Getting sheets out of the linen closet in the hallway adjoining the other bedrooms would be difficult to do without alerting anyone.</p> <p>\u201cIn the hallway,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>He smiled, kissed the tip of her nose, and yanked the covers aside. \u201cI\u2019ll get them.\u201d</p><p>She prayed no one would question him if he got caught.</p><p>\u201cHe was sleeping with her last night,\u201d Tom said, his tone angry as he talked to someone downstairs in the great room of Darien\u2019s home.</p><p>Ryan smiled and held onto Carol tighter in the bed in her guestroom. After a long night of whimpers and struggling against unseen forces and the most wondrous sex, Carol had finally settled down into a deeper sleep.</p><p>And yeah, he was sleeping with her\u2014or trying to, anyway. He wondered now if the way she\u2019d whimpered through the night, half-waking from nightmares, had occurred on other occasions. Was that what had been keeping her awake nights? But every time he had tightened his hold on her, she had relaxed and fallen into a more restful sleep. He didn\u2019t need to stay up all night sitting in the recliner, not when he was able to wake at the slightest indication of trouble and shift quickly.</p><p>The nightmares she was experiencing gave him even more of a reason to stay with her like this, wrapped around her like a cocoon surrounding an awakening butterfly. A nearly naked butterfly, her T-shirt drawn midway up her waist, although he\u2019d pulled it down for her a couple of times during the night. Until they\u2019d pleasured each other in wild, abandoned, almost consummated sex. If she\u2019d given him the go-ahead, he might have let his other head rule his actions. But now she again wore her T-shirt, and he his boxers, in case anyone dropped in to check on them.</p><p>\u201cHell, Tom, what did you expect from an alpha male leader? That he\u2019d sit in the recliner dutifully? On the other side of the room?\u201d Jake responded finally.</p><p>\u201cDarien said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur brother can boss around our own people just fine. Others also. But Ryan, if you haven\u2019t noticed, doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. And he plays by his own rules.\u201d</p><p>Ryan could almost hear the smile in Jake\u2019s response. And for the first time, he noted Jake had called him Ryan, not McKinley. Even though alphas might not like having to butt heads with others, they still respected each other for having the gumption to stand up for what they felt was right. Had Ryan felt that Carol would have been more comfortable alone in bed, he would have sat in the recliner all night long. But he knew better.</p><p>She\u2019d needed someone\u2019s comforting touch. If not his, someone else\u2019s. And he sure as hell hadn\u2019t wanted it to be anyone else\u2019s. If any of the beta males had stayed with her and insisted she consummate a relationship while she was half drugged, she might be a mated wolf by now. Not that he had any ready knowledge about what the bachelors were like deep down, but he didn\u2019t trust any of them where Carol was concerned.</p><p>He ran his fingers through her soft hair, luxuriating in the silkiness. Until last night, when she had talked about the ordeal she\u2019d been through with the psychiatrist\u2014 and even her own family not believing her\u2014he hadn\u2019t realized how having psychic abilities could have been a problem for her growing up. Now that she was also one of the werewolf kind, she had new problems and more adjustments to make. Neither of which he could comprehend like someone who was forced to live like this.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not right for her,\u201d Tom persisted. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in her abilities. Hell, she deserves someone who knows just how special she is.\u201d</p><p>That Ryan could agree with. She was special all right.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the way he kissed her? Danced with her? If you want a chance at her, you\u2019d better make your move.\u201d</p><p>Tom responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t had dreams of her.\u201d</p><p>Silence followed.</p><p>Dreams? That was another thing Ryan hadn\u2019t believed in. The notion that someone dreamed about mating with the one that fate had chosen for them. Dream mating was something that Darien and some of his family had supposedly been cursed or gifted with. So now Tom thought that dreams would reveal the one for him also?</p><p>Pure nonsense.</p><p>\u201cDarien might have had the ability, Tom. You can\u2019t believe you will, too.\u201d Jake\u2019s tone was conciliatory, which surprised Ryan.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t heard Jake speak like that to his brother since he\u2019d been around the two of them. But he\u2019d heard Jake didn\u2019t believe in dream mating either, at least as far as it would involve him.</p><p>Someone paced. Then Tom said, \u201cSo why don\u2019t you make known how you feel about Carol?\u201d</p><p>Jake gave a short laugh, but it sounded forced, unnatural. \u201cSeems I\u2019m too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean Ryan. Carol needs to stay here. For Lelandi. Carol\u2019s one of our pack. She belongs here with us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jake countered with, \u201cShe needs to have a mate first and foremost. If Ryan turns out to be the one, so be it. Maybe he can convince her to shift before it\u2019s too late. None of us has had an ounce of luck with her. You know how dangerous it is for her not to get some control over her shifting.\u201d</p><p>That was another thing Ryan wholeheartedly agreed with. Carol needed to embrace her werewolf half without delay.</p><p>The brothers quit speaking, and their footfalls died away as they headed in the direction of the kitchen.</p> <p>Ryan kissed the top of Carol\u2019s head in a protective, consoling way, unwrapped his body from hers, and began to leave the bed. She\u2019d be getting ready for work at the hospital soon, and he intended to be with her every step of the way.</p><p>She tossed and turned, her hands searching for something. Him? Hell. Maybe she didn\u2019t have to work today. He crawled back under the covers and pulled her into his heated embrace, vowing this time to control his sexual urges better.</p><p>Being a bodyguard had never felt quite this... pleasurable. He suspected it would never feel the same way again.</p><p>Later that morning, after he had breakfast with Darien, Ryan intended to call Carol\u2019s mother about the situation with the psychiatrist. But he didn\u2019t want Darien, his brothers, or Lelandi to know about it and get the wrong idea. If they heard he was calling to verify that Carol truly had had an early vision, he was sure that would put him in the doghouse. His investigative skills dictated that he ask Carol\u2019s mother about the episode with the psychiatrist to learn how he\u2019d treated her and if her mother believed in Carol\u2019s abilities now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to make an important call,\u201d he said to Darien as he finished the last of his eggs and another slice of ham, the sun streaming in through the kitchen window and warming the room. Lelandi had relieved him a half hour earlier to sit in the recliner and watch over Carol while she still slept. Lelandi was using the time to catch up on her studies on behavioral psychology.</p> <p>Tom and Jake planned to hang around the house guarding the ladies today. The brothers had taken up positions in the sunroom and in the den, so they would be safe for the moment.</p><p>Darien raised a brow and sipped his coffee. \u201cI understand you slept with Carol last night.\u201d</p><p>Alpha leader. Protective of his pack member. No beating around the bush. \u201cShe was experiencing night terrors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything occur between you two that I should know about?\u201d</p><p>Again, to the point.</p><p>\u201cIf you mean did we mate, no. She was drugged and consequently asleep for the most part, although her nightmares partly woke her half the night.\u201d Darien didn\u2019t need to know about the rest.</p> <p>The doorbell rang and Tom hurried from the sunroom to get it, passing the kitchen on the way to the front door and giving Ryan a reproachful look. Darien smiled wryly.</p><p>A couple of minutes later, Tom carried a vase of roses to the sunroom.</p><p>Darien motioned to Ryan\u2019s phone. \u201cGo, make your call. We\u2019re all here to watch over Carol until you return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake only a minute.\u201d Ryan headed for the great room and then made his way to the back patio. Outside, he called information, got Carol\u2019s parents\u2019 home phone number, and punched it in.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d a woman asked, sounding like Carol, only a little older, but with a voice a little sharper.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. Wood. This is Ryan McKinley.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a private investigator out of Green Valley.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d she growled.</p><p>He paused. Hell, had Carol told her mother about him?</p><p>\u201cI was calling about...\u201d He rephrased the comment. \u201cCarol told me about her ordeal with that psychiatrist, Dr. Metzger. About how\u2014\u201d The phone clicked dead in his ear.</p><p>Carol woke to the turning of pages in the guestroom and felt her legs pinned beneath the comforter, but Ryan was gone. Disappointment vanished when she glanced down and saw what was wedged between her legs. Her heart lifted. Puss. Her tabby: soft, happy, and sound asleep. She couldn\u2019t believe Darien had allowed her cat to leave the kennel so he could stay with her.</p><p>A warm, fuzzy feeling instantly filled her with serenity. She smiled, pulled Puss into her arms and cuddled him soundly. Then she looked at Lelandi, who was seated in the recliner reading one of her psychology books. Lelandi was determined to become a psychologist. Darien backed her, but he had lots of stipulations about her work. No seeing males who needed her services alone unless she had his permission. He\u2019d prefer it if only females wished her to help them with their life issues. But knowing Lelandi, if anyone made an appointment with her to discuss problems, she\u2019d see them. With or without Darien\u2019s approval.</p><p>Even though Carol had had a bad experience with a psychiatrist, she knew Lelandi would be perfect as a psychologist. She was a lot more open minded, for one thing.</p><p>Carol wished Ryan was still with her, although she was afraid things might have heated up between them again. And this time they might have gotten caught.</p><p>On the other hand, maybe he regretted what they had done. She tried not to think of it, but still, a little irksome worry fluttered around in the pit of her stomach. Seeing him this morning without letting on was not going to be easy.</p><p>Puss\u2019s little motor began to rumble. He stretched a little and then continued to sleep, rolled up in a ball, eyes shut, breathing slight. Carol was thrilled to have Puss back. Sighing, she gave him another gentle squeeze.</p><p>What had changed Darien\u2019s mind?</p><p>Lelandi looked up from her book and gave her a bright smile. \u201cYou\u2019re awake. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Except for my arm.\u201d The skin was bruised and the muscle sore. Carol thought what a lousy nurse the man would have made.</p><p>\u201cOne of the men gave you a shot. The bruise should fade soon. Do you remember what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone grabbed me from the shower. Stuck the needle in my arm first, though, and I felt drugged. Then he dropped me on the grass, I guess. I must have been slowing them down once Sam and Darien were in hot pursuit. Ryan found me, I think. And carried me back to the house. I recall him rinsing out my eyes, and then that\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. He stayed with you last night. Did anything... happen between the two of you?\u201d</p><p>Carol raised her brows. \u201cYou think we had sex last night?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi smiled a hint. \u201cIf you\u2019re mated, Darien has to let the bachelors know you\u2019re no longer available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything last night.\u201d Not that Carol would admit to, but Lelandi was observing her closely, like a psychologist might observe a subject. She hoped she didn\u2019t look as guilty as she felt. \u201cHe slept with me?\u201d Wondering how anyone might have known. Had they heard their moans and groans while having sex?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Tom said. He peeked in on you sometime in the night to see if Ryan needed to be relieved from guard duty and found him with his arms wrapped tightly around you, his back naked. After Darien questioned Tom about every detail for what seemed an eternity\u2014 suspecting Tom was leaving some of the story out, Tom finally admitted he\u2019d heard you whimpering and poked his head in to make sure Ryan was being honorable.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s heart nearly stopped. Had Tom seen them in the throes of sexual frenzy? \u201cRyan was being honorable. Just helping to calm my night terrors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout being kidnapped? Or something else? More visions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remember.\u201d Carol yawned. Then she sat up abruptly. \u201cWhat time is it? I need to get to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatthew and Charlotte are working extra half-days to cover for you. Darien doesn\u2019t want you working today after what happened last night. Take a break, and you can go back to the hospital tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Carol slid out from under her sleeping cat, who stretched a little but didn\u2019t bother opening an eye. She crossed the floor to the antique dresser, jerked the drawer open, and yanked out a bra and panties.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. And no way am I making Charlotte and Matthew work my hours.\u201d She\u2019d fought hard to get a job at the hospital. She wasn\u2019t going to shirk her responsibilities now. \u201cWhy is Puss here?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi hesitated to say.</p><p>\u201cLelandi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnofficially, and just between you and me, I believe Darien felt badly that he told Ryan he couldn\u2019t stay with you and then you were kidnapped. But officially, he thinks that if you mostly have your life back the way it was before you were changed, you may accept our ways and shape-shift.\u201d</p><p>To have her life back, she\u2019d be living in her own apartment again. Instead, Darien had insisted she put her things in storage and close up her apartment. Her life as she had known it was over. Yet, she\u2019d become accustomed to being with others\u2014with Lelandi, with Darien, with his brothers. The thought of returning alone to her apartment and only having Puss to talk to didn\u2019t appeal, either.</p><p>Carol shook her head and grabbed a pair of kitty-cat scrubs from another drawer. \u201cIf I shift, I won\u2019t be able to shift back. Simple as that.\u201d She entered the bathroom and shut the door.</p><p>\u201cDid you see this in a vision?\u201d Lelandi asked from the recliner.</p><p>\u201cNo, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say Darien shifts and can\u2019t change back. Is he the only one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc also. Jake is in the same predicament as well. You\u2019re really upset and want me to do something about it. But I can\u2019t. I have no idea what\u2019s happening. If everyone chooses to ignore me, I can\u2019t help anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe love to shift, Carol. It\u2019s part of who we are.\u201d But this time Lelandi didn\u2019t sound quite so sure of herself.</p><p>Carol dressed, brushed her hair, and applied a little makeup.</p><p>When she opened the bathroom door, Lelandi smiled at her. \u201cReady for some breakfast? With Sam and Ryan chowing down with Darien and his brothers, there may not be anything left. Mervin\u2019s down there also, but he eats like a bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can grab a bagel and green tea at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. If you want just tea and a bagel, the guys probably haven\u2019t touched those. But the bacon and sausages? I\u2019m sure Tom will have to make another trip to the store.\u201d Lelandi opened the door to the guestroom and walked into the hallway. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve seen Darien, Doc, and Jake unable to shift and me agitated. Do you see me change and unable to shift back?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot yet. But maybe you\u2019re beginning to believe me.\u201d Carol studied Lelandi\u2019s petite frame as she walked down the stairs, wondering how long it would be before she began to show. Soon, she imagined, with triplets on the way.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Darien about the babies?\u201d Then it dawned on Carol: maybe that\u2019s why Lelandi was cautious about Carol\u2019s warning visions. Lelandi had more than herself to think of now.</p><p>\u201cHe guessed before we had the games. He wasn\u2019t happy that I had tried to keep it secret from him. He\u2019d worried that if someone had tackled me, I might have been hurt. Or the babies would have been. So he told all the guys in a special meeting that if they as much as made a hint of a move in my direction, he\u2019d oust them from the pack. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t have the tug-of-war game. Afraid I\u2019d want to participate and might injure myself.\u201d</p> <p>Carol had suspected as much.</p><p>Lelandi glanced back at her. \u201cDuring the game, I figured everyone would be afraid of touching me because I\u2019m Darien\u2019s mate. I didn\u2019t know that he\u2019d warned them away.\u201d Then she gave Carol another award-winning smile. \u201cAlphas are like that.\u201d She turned around and headed across the great room as Carol hurried to catch up. \u201cI imagine Ryan will be the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in my second sight.\u201d Carol shrugged. \u201cThings wouldn\u2019t work out between us.\u201d Then she frowned. \u201cWho else knows that Ryan slept with me last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine at least half of the pack. Maybe more. Tom was pretty incensed about it. When he talked to Jake, he didn\u2019t get the support he wanted, so he spoke to Darien and Sam. Sam told Silva, and you know how that goes. She means well, though. She wanted to warn the wolves of our pack that if they desired having you for a mate, they\u2019d better do something about it. If Ryan wants you, same thing. He\u2019d better stop resting on his laurels.\u201d</p><p>Incredulously, Carol shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d Lelandi pointed to the sunroom. \u201cYou have a dozen glass or ceramic vases, brass pots, and baskets filled with flowers. Rosie, at the flower shop? She called and gave me a list of names. Silva wanted to know who hadn\u2019t sent you flowers and wangled it out of her.\u201d</p><p>Carol sighed. \u201cIsn\u2019t anything sacred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRarely, in a pack. You know who didn\u2019t send you flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom, Jake, and Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo of the three did. I have to tell you, I was pretty darned amused.\u201d</p><p>Carol pulled Lelandi to a stop outside the kitchen where the men\u2019s conversation had died. She\u2019d made out Darien and his brothers, Ryan, Sam, and even that lame Mervin talking in the room before they heard Lelandi and Carol\u2019s conversation.</p> <p>Lelandi\u2019s expression brightened. \u201cEveryone but Ryan sent you flowers. Sure sign he\u2019s in love. Darien did the same with me when I was injured.\u201d</p><p>Ryan and everyone else in the kitchen had to have heard what was said. Every inch of Carol\u2019s skin heated with mortification. But then she concentrated not on who hadn\u2019t given her flowers\u2014she figured Ryan wasn\u2019t a romantic\u2014but who had... Tom and Jake.</p><p>Lelandi leaned over and whispered to Carol, \u201cJake didn\u2019t give me flowers, either, when everyone else did. I figured he was too cheap.\u201d She straightened. \u201cSo there might be something to it, you think?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi gave her a conspiratorial wink, and Carol realized Lelandi was doing her matchmaking business with her, just as she was always doing with Silva and Sam.</p><p>But what if Ryan and she were already a match? Or maybe this was just a test on his part. See if the female wolf is right for the alpha male leader. She was reminded once again that she really didn\u2019t understand this werewolf business as much as she needed to, if she was going to make the right decisions from now on. With her head held high and her stomach flittering with unwanted jitters, she walked into the kitchen.</p><p>Ryan instantly caught her eye, and as hot as her face was, she had to have flushed crimson.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>WELL, THAT WAS ONE MESSED-UP OPERATION, NORTH thought to himself as he and two of his men stood in the forest miles from Silver Town, trying to come up with an alternative plan.</p> <p>\u201cHell, North. You said that it would be a piece of cake. That no one would even miss the red. Shows what you know.\u201d Galahad, so named because he thought of himself as a knight who had been concerned about their pack\u2019s direction while Bruin had run it, motioned to the ground and a rough-hewn map he was drawing in the soil. \u201cHere\u2019s the new plan. We grab her at the hospital. When she\u2019s in the break room. Or when she\u2019s coming or going. Maybe when she\u2019s in with a patient.\u201d</p><p>North shook his head. \u201cMiller won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I don\u2019t trust him. He\u2019s renovated the basement of that old place, turned it into his own private quarters, lab and all, and I swear it\u2019s like a bunker. No telling what all he\u2019s doing down in his lab with all that bioengineering crap. He\u2019s quiet and thoughtful, too thoughtful. Something\u2019s going on in that mind of his. He might be a genius, but I swear he\u2019s a borderline nutcase, too.\u201d Galahad gave North a hard look, emphasizing his dislike of Miller.</p><p>\u201cOne of us can be a patient,\u201d Hank said. He was Galahad\u2019s brother, a nice enough red but a little too preoccupied with computer role-playing games for North\u2019s liking. Hank seemed to have missed the whole point of Galahad\u2019s tirade. Or maybe it was that they\u2019d heard it before, and Hank didn\u2019t believe anything was wrong with Miller then, or now.</p><p>\u201cIf we wear the hunter\u2019s scent, no one would be the wiser. As long as Lelandi doesn\u2019t show up at the hospital and spot any of us. She\u2019s the only one who knows us from the pack,\u201d Hank added.</p><p>Galahad pointed a stick at North. \u201cHe was in the house when the fight was going on. Darien and others in his pack may very well recognize him. But the rest of us...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe weren\u2019t there, and as long as they can\u2019t make us out to be reds, we could pull it off.\u201d</p><p>North didn\u2019t like it. The whole thing had been his plan\u2014and it would have worked if that damned gray pack leader from Green Valley, McKinley, hadn\u2019t spied Hank snooping around the forest surrounding Darien\u2019s home. Now North was left out of the whole deal. \u201cI don\u2019t want Carol Wood hurt.\u201d</p><p>Hank grinned at Galahad. \u201cI told you he wants her for his own.\u201d Then he scowled. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have dropped her and left her for the grays.\u201d</p><p>North gave him a look like he\u2019d better watch his words. No one was exactly the pack leader yet. North wanted to be, but he was still butting heads with his cousin Connor. Because of that, no one in their newly formed pack took North as seriously as he thought they should. Then again, he suspected, the bioengineer in their renegade group of werewolves had some loftier plans of his own in mind.</p><p>Miller Redford liked to work behind the scenes. North felt as though the rest of the bachelor males would take all the risk, and then Miller would step out of his lab bunker and end up with the prize and maybe even the pack. He was sneaky and smart. He didn\u2019t outwardly act as though he were the take-charge type, sticking more to his lab and his scientific studies. But Miller had a way of smiling and shifting his eyes when North questioned his intentions that made North leery.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a red, turned by my cousin, and since Connor is sick and out of the picture for now, it\u2019s up to me to bring her home,\u201d North said to Hank and his brother. \u201cShe belongs to us. As far as what happened? Hell, they were catching up to me. And would have if I hadn\u2019t left her behind. I doubt they would have gone easy on me after we took Carol the way we did.\u201d</p><p>Galahad poked his stick at the square drawn into the dirt that represented the hospital. \u201cHank\u2019s right. Admit it, North. You want her. But she has to be agreeable. Any of us,\u201d he said, motioning with a sweep of his stick, \u201cmight turn her head. So it\u2019s up to the little lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t agree to it.\u201d Hank sat down on his haunches. \u201cThe grays already have brainwashed her about staying with them. Look at Lelandi. That Darien Silver did the same thing to her.\u201d</p><p>North glanced in the direction of Silver Town. \u201cBruin and his two brothers were the reason for Lelandi leaving our pack. We should have killed the three of them when we had the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the thing. We never had the chance. Hell, even your cousin who died was in thick with them.\u201d Galahad slapped North on the shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. If we could have, we would have eliminated our leaders and then brought her home. But now?\u201d He shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cThe nine of us have a pact. Start anew. The three of us need mates. Carol Wood\u2019s a red. And unmated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the two women we paid off to attend their gathering?\u201d Hank asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re grays, and except for an interest in our money, that was it. We need Carol Wood. She belongs to us.\u201d North looked back in the direction of Silver Town. \u201cMy cousin and the rest of us need her, and hopefully, soon she\u2019ll have a solution to our problem. We just can\u2019t let Miller know what we have in mind when we get hold of her.\u201d</p><p>Carol and Lelandi joined Darien and his brothers, Sam, Ryan, and Mervin for a bite of breakfast. The men appeared to have finished theirs already, with dirty plates remaining, but they were all sipping fresh cups of coffee. The worst thing was that Carol and Ryan\u2019s gaze instantly caught\u2014and held\u2014and she knew everyone was watching their actions. Which made it even worse when her skin flushed with heat as if she\u2019d just stepped into a sauna.</p><p>Ryan looked like he felt her pain, yet he wouldn\u2019t release her gaze, as if he wanted her to know he felt no remorse for what had occurred between them. She didn\u2019t either, except that she had had an audience as witnesses, and she was certain she had given Ryan and her activities away.</p><p>She hurried over to the teakettle and heated water for a cup of tea.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a traumatic experience and need to stay here with... that cat of yours,\u201d Darien said grudgingly, as she toasted a half a bagel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least he wasn\u2019t talking about Ryan and her. She raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cPuss. Thanks so much for allowing him to stay with me. He\u2019ll contentedly sleep until he wants to roam in the room, and then he\u2019ll go back to sleep. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d But that clinched the deal that Darien wasn\u2019t fond of cats. Probably a canine thing.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t make Matthew and Charlotte put in longer shifts because I\u2019ve failed to report to work. Besides, Doc Weber said another four patients have shown up with cases of the flu. Not the swine flu, thankfully, so no one needed overnight admittance, but the staff is getting swamped.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Lelandi said. \u201cJust to hang around for a while until you\u2019re through.\u201d</p><p>Carol buttered her bagel. \u201cAbsolutely not. I don\u2019t want you coming down with anything.\u201d She turned off the teakettle, figuring it was going to take too long to make a cup of tea if Darien was making an issue about her staying home. Headed for the doorway with bagel in hand, she brushed past Jake, who shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhen the boss\u2014that\u2019s Darien\u2014\u201d Jake said in a sarcastic way, jerking his thumb in Darien\u2019s direction, \u201cwants something, he gets it. If he says you\u2019re to stay home, it\u2019s not open for debate.\u201d Jake picked up his plate and took it to the dishwasher.</p><p>Darien gave a hint of a smile.</p> <p>Carol smiled broadly and grabbed Ryan\u2019s hand, while he stood in anticipation of her departure for the hospital.</p><p>\u201cI have my bodyguard. Unless you or Tom want the job.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s hand tightened on hers as if he wasn\u2019t giving her up to anyone else\u2019s protection. She glanced up to see his expression. He gave her lifted brows and a small smile in response. But the smile indicated something way more than anything to do with guarding her, as if he was thinking about what she was thinking about\u2014and if she didn\u2019t quit thinking about him and his slick moves in that way, he was going to do something about it.</p><p>\u201cI want the job,\u201d Mervin said, sounding peeved and pulling her attention away from Ryan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying for Ryan to serve in that capacity.\u201d Darien cast a hard look at Mervin.</p><p>Mervin appeared to still be in the doghouse over his accosting her the night before at the gathering.</p> <p>\u201cSo see? This way, Ryan will earn his pay. If he got to loaf around your house, it would be like paying him for vacation time,\u201d Carol said, squeezing Ryan\u2019s hand. She wasn\u2019t letting him go. And his smile hinted at a darker secret and desire.</p><p>\u201cYou stay with her even when she\u2019s seeing a patient,\u201d Darien warned Ryan.</p><p>He gave Darien a mock salute. \u201cHadn\u2019t planned on doing anything differently.\u201d</p><p>Carol frowned, not believing Darien would suggest that. \u201cPatient privacy issues come into play here. Policy dictates that Ryan can\u2019t be in an exam room when I\u2019m seeing a patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake up your mind, Carol,\u201d Darien said, not willing to be challenged in the matter. \u201cEither he stays with you at all times, or you remain home. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>She let out her breath hard.</p><p>\u201cDoc can put you on werewolf cases only. There won\u2019t be any privacy issues then,\u201d Lelandi said, trying to smooth things over. \u201cDarien\u2019s right. You can\u2019t be alone at any time.\u201d</p><p>Carol didn\u2019t intend to be. She planned to make up a syringe full of the same cocktail she figured the red had given her. And she\u2019d give it right back if any of them tried to grab her again.</p> <p>\u201cThat should work,\u201d she said cheerfully, although if the workload was mostly human, she\u2019d help out and Ryan could wait beyond the exam-room door, despite what everyone else said.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d she asked Ryan, tugging on his hand.</p><p>He yanked out his keys. \u201cLet\u2019s take care of your patients.\u201d</p><p>Jake pulled out his keys to his truck. \u201cI\u2019ll follow, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Tom tucked his phone into its pocket at his belt.</p><p>Mervin hurried to join them.</p><p>At least she felt safe with her entourage of bodyguards, although she really didn\u2019t think the reds would be bold enough to try and take her at the hospital anyway. She hurried to eat her bagel as Ryan walked her to his truck. She\u2019d have a cup of green tea at work later because she was afraid Darien would change his mind and want her to stay if she remained at the house much longer.</p><p>Movement in her bedroom window caught her eye, and she looked up to see Puss watching her through the glass, his tail twitching and his ears perked. She had a twinge of regret that she couldn\u2019t have cuddled with him longer.</p><p>\u201cYou were having nightmares last night. What about?\u201d Ryan asked, pulling her from her thoughts.</p><p>She had thought he might talk about their nighttime moves. She sighed and climbed into Ryan\u2019s truck and tilted her chin up slightly. \u201cI have one better than that. A vision. At least I think it was. I was kind of doped up at the time. But I saw Jake become a wolf, and then he was unable to shift back.\u201d</p><p>Ryan didn\u2019t say anything as he climbed into his truck and then pulled onto the road toward town. \u201cDid you have a vision of your kidnapping?\u201d</p><p>He still didn\u2019t believe that the men in the pack had turned into wolves and couldn\u2019t return to their human forms. \u201cNo. I told you the visions can be irritatingly unpredictable. It would have been nice to see it happen beforehand...to at least prepare myself, but it doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d She stared out the window, watching the firs whiz by. But then an uneasy feeling crept through her when she recalled something else. \u201cOh, no...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no... what?\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her temple, trying to recall the exact details. \u201cI...I had a vision before we went into the tavern yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Ryan stared at her. \u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man with long, red hair. It dangled in my face when he bent over me. He wore a padded vest. And I felt so tired, so incredibly tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow else do you explain it?\u201d she asked quietly, studying his taut profile as he continued to watch the road as he drove toward town. \u201cYou pulled me out of it when you said something to me in the truck after we arrived at the tavern. I had no idea what the vision meant.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched, and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>She looked back out the window.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a pact back then that I would tell you if I had any visions\u2014and you wouldn\u2019t have believed me anyway. Besides, it didn\u2019t seem important. And I didn\u2019t think about it when we were in the tavern.\u201d</p><p>Ryan grunted. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t have them unless they were important to you. So it seems this would have been important. And you said that they were premonitions of something that would occur pretty soon. You should have said something to me. Did you recognize him? See a face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy... my eyes burned. I remember how blurry my sight was when I tried to see him. I thought it was the vision, but I think now it was because my eyes were filled with soap.\u201d</p><p>Ryan mulled that over, not saying anything for about a mile, and then shook his head. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does this work, Carol? Do you conjure up the visions? Something trigger them? Or do they just happen?\u201d</p><p>She studied his stern face. \u201cThey just happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t force one?\u201d He glanced at her, his eyes trying to read her like a wolf\u2019s would.</p><p>She looked back out the window.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for some time, but then he pulled over to the side of the road. Startled, she glanced at Ryan, wondering what was up now.</p><p>Jake drove up behind them and parked. Ryan\u2019s cell phone rang, and he jerked it off his belt and flipped it open. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re okay, Tom. We just have to discuss a little matter.\u201d He ended the call and pocketed his phone. \u201cCan you force a vision?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at Ryan. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine not exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not normal for me to be able to force a vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the changes in me. Being a werewolf. Or maybe as I grow older I have a little more control. I don\u2019t know. Sometimes I can do so now. Not any particular one, but of something that is close to happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarien not being able to shift back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWishful thinking?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>She cast him her chilliest look, one that could have frozen the nearby lake despite it being spring. \u201cThe night before last, I envisioned someone in a red-and-white-striped jacket tackling me. The feeling I had wasn\u2019t fear but annoyance, so I knew it couldn\u2019t be too bad.\u201d</p><p>Ryan swore under his breath, reached out and took Carol\u2019s hand, and squeezed. \u201cMervin at the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s the one that kept me awake half the night with the stupid visions of him.\u201d</p><p>Ryan sighed. \u201cAll right.\u201d He pulled back onto the road and headed the rest of the way into town.</p><p>All right? Now he believed her?</p><p>\u201cHow about a vision of anything else? Foresee any problems at work, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll let you know about any visions I have. I said I would.\u201d</p><p>He drove in silence for a while and then said, \u201cWhy did you conjure up the vision of Darien?\u201d</p><p>She sighed under her breath. What difference would it make if Ryan knew? She looked out the window and said softly, \u201cTo keep from shape-shifting.\u201d</p><p>Ryan remained so quiet that she glanced back at him. He snapped his mouth shut. Then he said, \u201cHell, Carol. You\u2019re a ticking time bomb.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cReally hot stuff you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hot, all right. And you\u2019ll work with only werewolf patients, like Darien ordered.\u201d Ryan glanced at Carol, his expression all business. She would obey him, or else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled back. \u201cOf course. Unless we\u2019re swamped with human patients.\u201d</p><p>Ryan ran his hands over the steering wheel. \u201cThat\u2019s not the deal, and I won\u2019t go along with it. You\u2019re one dangerous lady. So about these nightmares you\u2019re having...\u201d</p><p>She sighed loudly. \u201cThey\u2019re about the visions, about being bitten and changed, and they haunt me. Probably brought about by the drug the reds used on me.\u201d She wondered if the drug had inhibited the need to shift last night. She took a deep breath, relieved she hadn\u2019t tried to shift while Ryan was sleeping with her. Or doing anything else. A chill cascaded down her spine. Could having sex trigger a shift?</p> <p>\u201cDo you... believe in dream mating?\u201d he asked out of the blue.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>HER STOMACH CLENCHING WHEN RYAN QUERIED HER about dream mating as he drove her to the hospital, Carol worried that maybe he believed in such a thing and was searching for the woman of his dreams. And she wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>Still startled, she stared at him in disbelief. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. But I wondered if you did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her stomach unclenched several degrees. She thought about the stories Lelandi had told her and nodded. \u201cSure. Lelandi and Darien were dream mated. I didn\u2019t know such a thing could exist until I heard of their case. Why bring it up?\u201d</p><p>Ryan remained silent, and Carol huffed. \u201cYou tantalize me with some tidbit of news and then don\u2019t share it with me? What if I were to do that with you? Say that you wouldn\u2019t believe the vision I had this morning, but then not tell you what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>She paused and then let out her breath. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it was the drug or what, but I saw a golden room and brilliant lights spilling into it from another room. I was drawn to the lights, as if I didn\u2019t have any choice. And then shots were fired, and I heard...\u201d She thought for a moment. Ryan glanced at her. She continued, \u201cI heard Sam shouting. Then more shots rang out. So what brought on this dream mating query all of a sudden?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Ryan tapped his thumbs on the steering wheel and didn\u2019t answer her for some time. Then he said, \u201cWas the golden room a premonition of something to come, Carol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might have been nothing more than the effect of the drug.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThink carefully. You heard shots in the vision? Before Sam shouted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gunfire might have been outside of the vision. I might have heard it as I was envisioning the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, his voice dark. \u201cShots rang out after Sam hollered. That\u2019s why they fired in his direction. At the sound of his voice. No gunfire sounded before that.\u201d</p><p>Carol considered the implications. Not good. She would be in a room headed toward another filled with bright lights where someone was shooting. Why would she do that?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking, Carol?\u201d He reached over to squeeze her ice-cold hand. His hand felt warm and large and secure.</p><p>\u201cThe room means danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re not going there.\u201d He glanced at her and continued to hold her hand.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t say anything for half a mile and then let out his breath. \u201cOkay, so what happens in the room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what\u2019s so frustrating about my visions. I don\u2019t know what happens. What about your dream mating inquiry?\u201d Carol watched him, chewing her lower lip. Had he dreamed of her? She was fairly sure she hadn\u2019t dreamed of him, and she was certain she would have remembered.</p><p>\u201cTom said he was waiting for the woman who would reach out to him in his dreams.\u201d Ryan glanced at her. \u201cI thought you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Which meant that if Ryan wasn\u2019t the one for her, she\u2019d have to scratch Tom off her list, too. She sighed with disappointment. \u201cThat\u2019s good to know. But a dream woman is no match for the real thing.\u201d She folded her arms around her waist.</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning that if the right woman came along, whether she was in his dream or not, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d want her.\u201d She looked out the window. It appeared to be the start of another sunny day, not a cloud in the sky... too bad she had to work. After the terror of last night, it would have been nice to curl up on Darien\u2019s porch with Puss sleeping on her lap, a cup of hot cocoa, and a good time-travel romance set in Scotland to read. Or if the house had been empty, she could have taken a nap with Ryan, although she might not have gotten any sleep.</p><p>But then again, she wouldn\u2019t have taken that much enjoyment in either, knowing Matthew and Charlotte had to work longer hours to make up for her not being there.</p><p>\u201cJake doesn\u2019t believe in dream mating,\u201d Ryan said, as if that would make her feel better.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t blame him really. I\u2019m sure I\u2019d never conjure up my soul mate that way, either. But still, it\u2019s an interesting way to satisfy some needs before they can be truly met. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>Ryan pulled into the hospital parking lot, and Jake parked right alongside him on the passenger\u2019s side. \u201cI think any substitute for the real thing wouldn\u2019t be half as satisfying.\u201d He gave her a slow predatory grin.</p><p>Her body felt like she\u2019d been roasting in the sun all day, but she managed a shake of her head and a small smile. \u201cLelandi warned me you were a wolf.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, but before he could say anything further, her door opened. She turned to see Jake holding it open for her, waiting for her to exit the truck.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jake.\u201d She cast Tom a sideways glance. \u201cI hear you\u2019re waiting for a dream mate to appear for you. Hope you don\u2019t have to wait long.\u201d She smiled, even though she was disappointed. She\u2019d have to scratch him off her list of hopeful mates, which looked as though that left her only with Jake. She hurried inside the hospital as Tom turned to his brother and scowled.</p><p>\u201cYou told her that?\u201d Tom asked his brother.</p><p>\u201cHell, no. I don\u2019t even believe in that nonsense.\u201d Jake looked at Ryan, who raised his brows as if he didn\u2019t know what they were talking about.</p><p>Ryan stalked after Little Miss Nightingale. What part of\u2014he was her protector at all times\u2014did she not get?</p><p>\u201cWho the hell else knows?\u201d Tom asked Jake, following them into the hospital as Mervin brought up the rear.</p><p>\u201cI swear I didn\u2019t tell anyone about our conversation. I don\u2019t know how Carol found out.\u201d</p><p>Ryan wasn\u2019t one to eavesdrop, normally, unless it suited his purpose in his P.I. work. But if Tom wasn\u2019t truly interested in Carol, and she had hopes he might be, Ryan hadn\u2019t wanted her to be disappointed. He stalked after her as she headed down the hall of the clinic, while Tom, Jake, and Mervin trailed behind them.</p><p>The place smelled of disinfectant and fresh floor wax, rubbing alcohol, and, in the staff lounge, harsh coffee brewing. Ryan couldn\u2019t imagine working in a hospital environment, day after day. He much preferred the fresh out-of-doors, where he met with the residents and businessmen as mayor while coming up with plans for improving the city; the fragrance of new leather in his truck while he was in his P.I. surveillance mode; and the aroma of cocoa java bubbling at his office, compliments of his administrative assistant. Ingrid dutifully kept the business going whenever he was on an assignment elsewhere.</p><p>A tall male nurse named Matthew approached them, wearing blue scrubs and carrying a chart. He looked official as he headed toward Ryan and Carol in the wide hall washed in light. With dark hair and eyes, and a build that was a little scrawny and wiry, he looked like most of the other grays in Darien\u2019s pack. The guy cast Carol a harried smile, and that bugged Ryan more than he wanted to admit. Matthew pinned Ryan with a look that meant he didn\u2019t like Ryan following Carol so closely.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s her bodyguard,\u201d Jake said, explaining the relationship.</p><p>Matthew\u2019s expression remained hard, and he said to Carol, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t make it to the gathering. Work, you know. But if you\u2019d like to go out tonight...\u201d</p><p>He let his words trail off. If Ryan had been Matthew, he would have scheduled the date, not left it up in the air like that. The other thing that bugged Ryan was that the rest of the pack knew about Carol\u2019s abduction already, so this clown had to. Otherwise, he was certain Matthew would have asked why she needed a bodyguard. So why didn\u2019t Matthew say anything about her being kidnapped and offer her consolation, protection, or anything? The guy was a total loser when it came to winning a woman over\u2014that\u2019s why.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you want to go?\u201d Ryan asked Matthew. \u201cOn a date?\u201d</p><p>Matthew\u2019s jaw dropped. Carol looked like she was fighting a smile. Jake grinned. Tom shook his head. Mervin stared at Ryan as if he had lost his mind.</p><p>Ryan folded his arms. \u201cI go where Carol does. So...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWhere did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Matthew stiffened and spoke again to Carol as if Ryan hadn\u2019t just addressed him. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later. Have to see a patient. Another case of the flu, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019ve heard she came to the gathering last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gathering?\u201d Carol glanced in the direction of the waiting area and saw Marilee reading a magazine. \u201cThe masseuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. The other, Becky? The librarian? She was already in here earlier.\u201d</p><p>Carol frowned. \u201cDiagnosis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Then they exposed Lelandi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m sure Darien\u2019s not going to like it, but then again, they probably didn\u2019t know they were coming down with it,\u201d Matthew said.</p><p>\u201cMarilee could have known,\u201d Ryan argued. \u201cShe began coughing when I danced with her. She said it was allergies. If she\u2019s got the flu, she could very well have suspected that\u2019s what she had. She may have been worried that Darien wouldn\u2019t let her come to the gathering.\u201d</p><p>Matthew clenched his medical chart, his neck muscles tightening. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with a Private Dick. Everyone\u2019s guilty until proven innocent.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave anything in your past you\u2019re afraid to share with the pack, Matthew? I understand you came here after your brother and his family and you had difficulties in a former pack. Anything that could create problems for you here if your past came under scrutiny? I\u2019d be happy to look into it for Darien as a favor to the family.\u201d</p><p>Matthew\u2019s face reddened, and Ryan wondered what the nurse might have to hide. Carol looked like she didn\u2019t appreciate Ryan bringing it up here in front of Jake. But if the guy was going to attack Ryan\u2019s business ethics, he was fair game.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get together another time for a date.\u201d Matthew gave her another hint of a smile, cast a deadly look at Ryan, and hurried off.</p> <p>Satisfied that he\u2019d chased off a potential suitor who wasn\u2019t good enough for Carol, Ryan waited for her to go about her nursing business.</p><p>\u201cBeing in charge of my social calendar is not what you\u2019re paid to do,\u201d she said with mock indignation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting paid to guard you wherever you go and no matter who you\u2019re with, Carol. That\u2019s the deal.\u201d Ryan smiled.</p><p>Carol did not look too disappointed that he had put a damper on the date with the male nurse, however, Ryan noted.</p><p>Jake grinned at the exchange and then grew serious and started giving orders. \u201cMervin, take a chair and sit by the back door so you can make sure no one we don\u2019t know goes in or out of there. Tom, you can watch the entryway and waiting room. I\u2019ll check out the exam rooms and the perimeter of the place while Carol sees her patients. And, Ryan, let either of us know if you need a break, and we\u2019ll stick close to Carol then.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan offered a single nod.</p><p>Jake gave Carol a last command also. \u201cYou see only special patients, not any of the others, Carol. One of us has to be with you at all times.\u201d</p><p>Exasperated, she sighed. \u201cFine. I have work to do.\u201d She headed into an exam room and busied herself with something nursing in nature, Ryan assumed, while he watched her back. Afterwards, she went to her station, took the first patient\u2019s chart, and then returned to the waiting area.</p><p>Ryan wanted to speak with her about what had happened between them earlier that morning. But he knew he shouldn\u2019t, or he\u2019d find himself sunk even deeper into a quagmire of trouble. The way she had looked at him in the kitchen that morning, flushed with awkwardness, had endeared her even more to him.</p><p>He figured everyone in the room\u2014Darien, his brothers, Lelandi, even that lame Mervin\u2014suspected more had gone on between Carol and him during the night than they\u2019d admitted. And he regretted he\u2019d have to be more... guard-like tonight. Sitting in the recliner would have to do.</p><p>His attention on Carol, Ryan felt like a puppy following his master around as Carol called out, \u201cMiss Silverpenny?\u201d But he didn\u2019t mind, as long as Carol remained safe.</p> <p>Silverpenny was a good gray name, and when the petite elderly woman stood up from a chair in the waiting area, Ryan relaxed a little. She appraised Ryan as she joined them and smiled at Carol. \u201cHow was the gathering, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Carol said, walking at the woman\u2019s slower pace to her nurse\u2019s station and casting a look at Ryan as if she didn\u2019t want him to contradict her.</p><p>But hell, he hadn\u2019t danced with anyone in eons who\u2019d made him feel like a randy teen like Carol had. And he would have remained on the floor, holding her close, swaying to a new song, if he hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d have to give her up to the other bachelor males after a dance or two. More than that, though. He hadn\u2019t wanted her to dance with Jake or Tom, not close like he\u2019d danced with her, and he\u2019d been afraid Jake might have tried to butt in.</p><p>Folding his arms, Ryan leaned against the wall across the hall and out of the way as Carol helped the woman stand on a scale.</p><p>\u201cI swear I shrank another inch and gained two more pounds,\u201d Miss Silverpenny grumbled, her slim figure on the frail side.</p><p>Carol smiled.</p><p>The woman cast a glance over her shoulder at Ryan. \u201cWhen she measures my height, she makes me remove my shoes.\u201d She motioned to the thick wedge-soled shoes she wore, which would add an inch and a half to anyone\u2019s height. She pointed an accusing finger at Carol, although her eyes twinkled with mirth. \u201cAnd when she takes just my weight, she won\u2019t let me remove my shoes.\u201d They had to have weighed at least five pounds.</p><p>The woman reminded him of his cantankerous old Aunt Tilda, good-natured and harmless.</p> <p>\u201cAre you her boyfriend?\u201d the woman asked, her tone serious now.</p><p>Ryan opened his mouth to reply in the negative, but Carol beat him to it, which bothered him to a degree. Not that he minded her telling the truth, but that she seemed so anxious to ensure no one thought he might be the one for her. What was wrong with him as a prospective mate, anyway?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carol quickly said to her patient, shaking her head as if her word wasn\u2019t enough to convince her.</p><p>The woman looked back at Ryan, raised her brows, and smiled a little.</p><p>\u201cYou might have heard I had some trouble last night, and, well, Ryan\u2019s watching over me to make sure there\u2019s not another... incident,\u201d Carol continued, as she readied a thermometer to take Miss Silverpenny\u2019s temperature.</p><p>The woman\u2019s kindly eyes widened, and then she nodded firmly. \u201cYes, you know how it is here in Silver Town. Everyone was alerted to the problem with the reds, and should anyone see any sign of them, they\u2019re to be reported.\u201d She waved her hand at Ryan.</p><p>\u201cAs for Ryan, I thought he was your boyfriend.\u201d She said it as if she hadn\u2019t heard Carol say he wasn\u2019t. \u201cYou can tell by looking at a man if he\u2019s good or good-for-nothing. Ryan has nice smile lines beneath his eyes. Not much in the line of wrinkles between his brows, which would indicate he frowns a lot.\u201d</p><p>Then she directed her comment to Ryan. \u201cWelcome to the...\u201d She stopped speaking when a human man walked into an exam room across the hall with Nurse Matthew. \u201c...to the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Miss Silverpenny, but I\u2019m just here for a short stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking our pretty little nurse away with you? Oh my, whatever will we do without you, Carol? She hasn\u2019t been with us for very long, but we adore her. Anyone who steals Darien\u2019s ribbon in a game of tag, other than Lelandi, of course, is someone to be admired.\u201d She seized Carol\u2019s hand and squeezed. \u201cWe\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s cheeks flooded with color. Ryan loved the blush on her cheeks. She didn\u2019t try to explain any further that she wasn\u2019t going anywhere and, instead, took the woman\u2019s temperature and then her blood pressure. Afterwards, Carol escorted her down the hall, led her into an exam room, and sat her in the chair across from Doc\u2019s, while Ryan closed the door for privacy.</p><p>\u201cIs he going to stay with you all day?\u201d Miss Silverpenny asked. \u201cNight, too?\u201d She smiled broadly.</p><p>Yeah, she was just like Ryan\u2019s Aunt Tilda. If his aunt knew he was staying with Carol, she\u2019d have him mated to her already, at least as far as gossip went.</p><p>With her pen poised over the patient\u2019s chart, Carol cleared her throat and asked, \u201cWhat are you having trouble with today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllergies. Doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m a wolf...\u201d She glanced at Ryan. \u201c...or running around as an old lady. I can\u2019t quit sneezing. If it\u2019s not that, my skin\u2019s itching to high heaven. But if I took that darned allergy medicine the doc gave me, I\u2019d be sleeping my life away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOmega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil from salmon, herring, and sardines can help as natural anti-inflammatory agents,\u201d Ryan said, trying to be helpful.</p><p>Carol opened her mouth to speak, but Ryan kept talking. \u201cMy Aunt Tilda had trouble with grass, ragweed, and mold. You name it, she was allergic to it. We didn\u2019t want her shifting into the wolf because her feet and legs itched so much from walking through tall grass. She\u2019d chew on her exposed skin incessantly until she turned back into her human form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d Carol said, her tone indignant. \u201cYou are my bodyguard. Not the doctor and not a trained nurse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said to Carol. He turned to Miss Silverpenny. \u201cMy apologies, ma\u2019am. But if you try some of that fish oil, you never know. Good for your heart and whatever else ails you. And also, although it\u2019s not been proven scientifically, my aunt\u2019s allergies are better when she has a little homegrown honey daily.\u201d</p><p>The old woman smiled at him. \u201cThank you, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else that is bothering you, Miss Silverpenny?\u201d Carol asked, her tone clipped.</p><p>\u201cOh no, dear. Since I\u2019m already here, I might as well see Doc while I\u2019m at it, but my goodness, you ought to hire your boyfriend at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor will be here any minute.\u201d Carol seized Ryan\u2019s arm with one hand and the doorknob with the other, opened the door and pulled him out, and then shut the door behind them.</p><p>A woman had never accosted Ryan in such a rough manner, and while he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d like it if most anyone else did, Carol was another story. Hell, the woman was a tinderbox ready to ignite, and her firm touch was stirring up his libido all over again. Too bad they couldn\u2019t put all that fire to good use.</p><p>Scowling, she guided him against a wall and released him, hands on her hips, brows furrowed in a cute little frown, standing so close to him to keep the conversation private that he could feel the heat from her sweet body. He wanted to pull her into a full body embrace, kiss her lips, draw the venom out of her bite, and prove to her that as much as he had irritated her, she couldn\u2019t stay annoyed for long.</p><p>Drawing him from his wayward thoughts, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s get this straight. You are not a doctor or a nurse, and you\u2019re not to give patients any medical advice.\u201d</p><p>Jake approached from down the hall, wearing a big-headed smirk that Ryan interpreted to mean he\u2019d been the subject of her ire before. Or maybe he was just amused at seeing Carol pinning Ryan to the wall with her verbal assault. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn the exam room, you stand against the door and look like a bodyguard. Not my boyfriend. Not medical counsel. A bodyguard. Period,\u201d she said to Ryan, her body so close to him that he could breathe in her peach scent, remembering vividly how he\u2019d rinsed the soap from her skin the night before, every inch silky and soft. And later, when he\u2019d kissed her soundly, his senses had filled with the delicious fragrance of her, the sweetness, the arousal, the heat of the moment.</p><p>The way her chest rose and fell with her hurried breathing and the flush of her cheeks stimulated some deeper need in him. Even the way she berated him appealed to him. He knew she was doing her job, making sure her patients got the best advice, although his advice came from his local doctor, so he knew it was sound. He loved the way she stood up for her patients, even if she had to know he was giving good information.</p><p>He wanted her. Wanted to take her all over again. To share the intimacy. To feel the heat burning between them and escalating.</p> <p>A smile tugged at his lips as he bowed his head slightly in agreement, his face nearly touching hers. He wanted to kiss her in the worst way. He was sure his smile led to her reiterating her point.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d she said, a little breathless and a lot flushed. He could tell she was as affected by their close proximity as he was. She motioned to Jake. \u201cIf you can\u2019t be quiet, Jake can take your place.\u201d</p><p>Jake lost the smirk and cleared his throat as he neared them. \u201cDidn\u2019t find anyone in the unoccupied exam rooms who shouldn\u2019t be here. Outside the hospital is clear. Deputy Trevor\u2019s watching things out front now. So far no problems with anyone coming in through the front door, and no one trying to slip in or out through the back door. How are the two of you getting along? Need a break, Ryan?\u201d Jake\u2019s expression was again amused.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little later,\u201d Ryan said, never taking his eyes off Carol\u2019s sharp blue ones. \u201cI\u2019ll practice being a bodyguard a while longer.\u201d Hell, forget the recliner. He was guarding her body in bed again tonight. He smiled.</p><p>Carol turned away from him, whipped out the next patient\u2019s chart, and stalked down the hall to the waiting area.</p> <p>Jake chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s a spitfire when she\u2019s angered. What did you say to rile her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold the patient she could use fish oil to help with her allergies. I also would have mentioned a dehumidifier if she was having trouble with mold. Worked for my aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have a degree in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife.\u201d Ryan headed after his charge.</p><p>Jake laughed behind him.</p><p>At first, Ryan couldn\u2019t see Carol in the waiting area from his location in the hallway, and his heart pounded faster as he increased his pace. But when he reached the sitting area, he saw her waiting for a man whose whole expression brightened when he saw her. He was about Ryan\u2019s age, limping toward her and smiling with a look that was an attempt at \u201cWoe is me\u2014give me sympathy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRobert, did you need a wheelchair?\u201d she sweetly asked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t sound as professional as Ryan would have liked. Not as serious. More good-natured and, well, way too sweet.</p><p>As Ryan approached, the man\u2019s amber eyes, pig-like in appearance, switched from Carol to Ryan, and he swore Robert looked like he was about to have a heart attack.</p><p>\u201cThe nurse asked if you needed a wheelchair,\u201d Ryan said, his voice verging on a growl as he advanced toward the muscular man.</p><p>Carol\u2019s mouth dropped open as she stared at Ryan. \u201cRyan McKinley, whatever is wrong? Mr. Grayce has lived in the area forever.\u201d</p><p>Ryan glowered at the man and folded his arms. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>After forgetting all about Tom, Ryan finally noticed him leaning against the check-in counter. Tom nodded to confirm Carol\u2019s statement, his expression bemused.</p><p>Carol cast Ryan an annoyed look and then took Robert\u2019s arm and helped him back to an exam room. Her hip pressed against the man\u2019s as she eased him down the hall at a crawl, and Ryan swore the patient leaned into her more than necessary. She should have gotten him a wheelchair or, at the very least, crutches or something. She didn\u2019t need to use her body to hold him up!</p> <p>\u201cWhere are the wheelchairs?\u201d Ryan growled.</p><p>Continuing down the hall with her charge without a backward glance, Carol ignored Ryan.</p><p>Half hiding a smile, Tom pointed to a storage room. Ryan stalked inside, grabbed a wheelchair, and hurried it after the limping man. Just in case the man was truly hurting, Ryan couldn\u2019t slam the chair into the back of Robert\u2019s legs like he wanted to, but he\u2019d give the poor guy a seat so he wouldn\u2019t have to limp all the way to the exam room.</p><p>Ryan stopped the wheelchair and seized the man\u2019s arm, assisting him into the seat, and then grabbed hold of the handles. He gave Carol a smile as her mouth gaped wide again. Then she snapped it shut.</p><p>\u201cThe least I can do as your bodyguard, Carol, is help with your patient.\u201d</p><p>As red as her face was, he was certain that, at the first opportunity, she would attempt to replace him as her bodyguard with anyone else. Mervin even.</p><p>He sighed heavily and wheeled Robert into the room Carol motioned to. He had never suspected that guarding the woman would be this difficult.</p><p>And this was only the first hour.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>\u201cHE\u2019S IMPOSSIBLE,\u201d CAROL SAID OVER HER CELL PHONE to Lelandi and then took another sip of her bottled water to finish it off. She was making the call from the hospital staff lounge during her break. Although as annoyed as she was with Ryan, Carol hated to admit she\u2019d miss him when he no longer had to guard her during her patient visits.</p><p>Ryan stood with his legs apart, arms folded, staring out the break-room window, still playing bodyguard and listening in on her conversation. Small break room. Wolf\u2019s hearing.</p><p>Coffee bubbled in a pot nearby, the aroma mixing with someone\u2019s beef-in-wine-sauce lunch that was hastily heating in the staff microwave.</p><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d she repeated and cast Ryan an annoyed look, but his back was to her so he didn\u2019t get the full benefit of her irritation.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do that was so wrong, Carol? He\u2019s supposed to be there protecting you. You have to make allowances. I know it\u2019s hard to have someone watching your every move. But he\u2019s only trying to help.\u201d Lelandi was her usual reassuring self, as if she was practicing her psychology lessons on Carol.</p><p>Feeling worn out from her experience in the woods the previous night and Ryan and her early morning romp into sated bliss, Carol propped her cheek on her hand as she rested her elbow on one of the lounge tables.</p><p>\u201cHe gave medical advice to six of my patients! Six! From allergy remedies to how to relieve tension headaches. Even gave them all kinds of dietary advice. And where did all this medical wisdom come from? Dealing with his Aunt Tilda, who has every ailment known to man and wolf kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas any of his advice dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, of course not. But he shouldn\u2019t be offering it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want Jake to stay with you instead? He said he would. Or Tom, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>Carol lifted her head and watched Ryan. His whole body had tensed. Something she had said? Or did something he was watching out of the window catch his attention?</p><p>He jerked his phone off his belt and then hesitated. She parted her lips to speak with him, but he suddenly flipped his phone open, punched a couple of buttons, and said, \u201cJake, south of the hospital, three men met across the street and then hurried down an alley. Yes, of course they should be checked out. I would, but I have to watch Carol. All three were wearing blue jeans and sweatshirts, real casual. They were taking a lot of interest in the hospital. Yet they didn\u2019t make any move to approach it. One even motioned to your truck and then mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d Lelandi said over the phone, breaking into Carol\u2019s concern about Ryan\u2019s conversation with Jake. \u201cDid you hear me? Did you want Jake to watch you instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake\u2019s got another mission,\u201d Carol said. She sighed. \u201cAfter Ryan\u2019s finished guarding me here, I\u2019m going to recommend he go to medical school.\u201d</p><p>Ryan snapped his phone shut, folded his arms again, and continued to watch out the window.</p><p>Even though she didn\u2019t want to believe that the men Ryan saw were the same ones who had grabbed her, she couldn\u2019t help the shiver trailing down her spine. The best medicine for what ailed her was work, though. She glanced at her watch. \u201cBreak time\u2019s up, Lelandi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have dinner on when you get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait. See you later.\u201d She closed her phone and said to Ryan, \u201cReady to go back to work?\u201d</p><p>He turned around and nodded, his face a mask of indifference.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it was them?\u201d she asked, rising from the chair and hoping she didn\u2019t sound nervous. But hell, they\u2019d shot her full of dope, taken her out into the cold naked, and dumped her when they thought they might get caught. No wonder it bothered her that they might try something like that again! She shoved her hand in her pocket and felt the syringe, her defensive weapon if she needed one.</p><p>\u201cCould have been. Or not.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what Ryan\u2019s response meant. He kept any hint of emotion out of his words so they were not reassuring but not alarming, either. She threw her empty water bottle in the trash and headed for her nurse\u2019s station.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t appreciate you being here for me, Ryan. I really do. But you could get yourself, me, and the hospital into a lot of trouble if you keep giving medical advice to patients.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak but then frowned and yanked his phone off his belt. As he walked her back to her station, he flipped the phone open.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jake? Same ones?\u201d He rubbed his chin, studying her.</p><p>Another tremor stole up her spine. Ryan was trying to keep his expression neutral, but she could tell he was worried by the way a small crease appeared between his brows and his eyes slightly tightened.</p><p>Hell. She\u2019d hoped that after Ryan and Darien and the others had kept those men away the night before, that would be the last of it. That today they were being way overcautious. And that tomorrow she wouldn\u2019t need Ryan or anyone else staying in the exam room with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right, Jake. Tom will watch over her. Be right there.\u201d Ryan raised a brow at her as he snapped his phone shut. \u201cSame rules as before. No seeing any humans. Tom will stay with you this time. Christian is going to watch the waiting room. Mervin\u2019s got the back door. I\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to try and track them down?\u201d She hated how worried she sounded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I do, Carol. I\u2019m a damn good P.I.\u201d He motioned to Tom who was already headed down the hall toward them. \u201cDid your brother call you?\u201d</p> <p>Tom joined them and stood near Carol in guard stance. \u201cYeah. Jake said for me to stay with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only to see special patients.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at him, perturbed that he didn\u2019t think she could handle this.</p><p>Ryan half hid a smile. \u201cIs Christian in place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he hurried over here and is sitting in the waiting room, pretending to be a patient, but he wanted to be the one in the room with Carol instead.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan shook his head. \u201cHe can want all he likes, but Carol needs one of us to watch over her.\u201d</p><p>The unspoken words were that she needed an alpha for protection. And Mervin and Christian were definitely not alphas.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Tom said. \u201cReady to get your next patient, Carol?\u201d</p><p>Ryan hesitated to leave. Did he think Tom couldn\u2019t handle it?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Carol shoved her hand in her pocket and ran her fingers over the syringe.</p><p>To her shock, Ryan stepped close to her, his gaze remaining on hers as he slipped his hand in her pocket, sliding his fingers over the inner-pocket fabric covering her thigh in a much too sensuous caress before he pulled out the syringe.</p> <p>Tom\u2019s eyes grew even bigger when he saw the syringe. \u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA weapon,\u201d Ryan said. He handed it back to her. \u201cYou won\u2019t need it, but if it makes you feel safer... keep it with you. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d Then he stalked off down the hall.</p><p>All of a sudden she didn\u2019t feel so safe. Sure Tom was an alpha, but Ryan was truly someone to be reckoned with if anyone got on his bad side. Hell, she had been afraid he might have given Robert Grayce a stroke, and here the poor guy had torn tendons from a bad fall at the silver mine. She thought Robert might have even asked her out if Ryan hadn\u2019t been hovering over him until Doc came to examine the man\u2019s leg. But she felt incredibly safe when Ryan was with her.</p><p>Now, she felt apprehensive again, and while she thought Ryan might be more successful than someone else trying to hunt the men down because of his P.I. and former police training, she still wished he hadn\u2019t gone.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Carol? Want to go home?\u201d Tom asked, concern etched in his expression.</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t leave the others to work here alone. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She patted his chest. \u201cI have you.\u201d And the hypodermic with the tranquilizer cocktail in her pocket.</p><p>Ryan was torn between wanting to stay and protect Carol and locating the bastards who had taken her from her shower. He hated that she felt she still wasn\u2019t safe, so much so that she had to keep a weapon\u2014syringe, nurse style\u2014with her for protection. On the other hand, he admired her for having the foresight to protect herself, and he knew she had the fortitude to carry out her plan, as long as a would-be kidnapper didn\u2019t get the upper hand.</p><p>If he could catch them, he\u2019d make sure they\u2019d never mess with Carol again\u2014or Lelandi either, if they had a mind to go after her next. He met Jake and Darien, their expressions hard and determined, near the woods where the reds had taken off.</p> <p>\u201cNone of us can shift this close to town,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>Darien raised his brows at him.</p><p>Jake shook his head.</p><p>Well, hell, Ryan was used to being a leader and not used to giving up command, even in another wolf\u2019s territory, at least not in a case like this where it was a dangerous situation. Darien motioned for them to get a move on. \u201cWe\u2019ve got several coming to aid in the search.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe... you want us to split up?\u201d Ryan asked, trying to be more amenable and not so much in charge, even if it killed him.</p><p>\u201cRyan, you\u2019re good at tracking. Probably better than most of my people. Sam and I will team up. Jake will go with you. Just watch out if they\u2019re shooting bullets again.\u201d</p><p>Appreciating Darien\u2019s comments, Ryan nodded and headed out while Jake ran to catch up to him.</p><p>Trudging alongside Ryan, Jake shook his head. \u201cI never in a millennium would have thought Darien would say that about you. But you know, I think he\u2019s kind of taken a liking to you. So, do you believe in Carol\u2019s sixth sense now?\u201d</p><p>Ryan bent down to check out a broken branch and then headed west. \u201cShe had a premonition about being taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if she thought she had the vision earlier, but she really had nightmares about it after the fact when she was still half doped up.\u201d Not that Ryan didn\u2019t believe her, but in his business, he always looked at all possible sides of an issue.</p><p>Yet, that didn\u2019t explain what she\u2019d been thinking of when she was sitting in his truck with a faraway look, like she was not really there. Just like when he\u2019d be deeply contemplating a case and Rosalind would interrupt his meditation with a question. He suspected Carol was telling the truth, that she\u2019d had a vision and that she truly had other psychic abilities.</p><p>\u201cKeep thinking she doesn\u2019t have psychic connections, and I\u2019ll have to mate her,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Ryan glanced at him. He looked damn serious. \u201cThen why the hell don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnoyingly, she\u2019s got a thing for you.\u201d</p><p>Ryan almost smiled.</p><p>\u201cIn this premonition of hers... she didn\u2019t tell you that someone might steal her away?\u201d</p><p>Glancing up from a footprint, Ryan gave him a look of exasperation. \u201cAre you going to help me search for these guys or just talk your fool head off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She said her visions are too vague. That she didn\u2019t know what this one meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble. Every time she\u2019s had a vision, it\u2019s been trouble.\u201d Jake sniffed the air. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019ve known her, yeah. So she\u2019ll always be a handful, I suspect.\u201d</p><p>Which supported Ryan\u2019s opinion that Carol needed someone uniquely qualified in her life. Someone who could deal with the dangerous situations she found herself in. She wasn\u2019t a police officer or trained in military tactics. Yet if she envisioned a crime being committed and she tried to stop it, or if the perp learned she knew about his or her commission of a crime, she could put herself in a world of jeopardy. Beyond that, she needed to learn how to control shifting. From what she had admitted to him, she needed someone to help her through the transition.</p><p>Ryan paused to examine scattered leaves. \u201cThey ran through here.\u201d He quickened his pace. \u201cShe needs an alpha, Jake.\u201d But not just any alpha.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. So that means you, me, or Tom, unless we let her go to another pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Tom thinks he\u2019ll find his dream mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and who the hell told Carol that?\u201d Jake frowned at Ryan, in protective brother mode.</p><p>Ryan hid a scowl. \u201cShe needed to know the truth. She was harboring some notion that Tom might be interested in her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Ryan glanced at Jake. \u201cAnd you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she practically melted in your arms during the dance. And the way she kissed you...\u201d Jake shook his head. \u201cGuess that means I\u2019ll have to call you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, see who wins the little lady.\u201d</p><p>Ryan chuckled under his breath. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019d love that. Probably decide to mate with Mervin instead and give the rest of us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what you said to Nurse Matthew. Do you really think he was in trouble in his previous pack?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>Ryan smiled a little. \u201cOnly as far as he fought with his pack leader\u2019s brother over a woman a number of times. That didn\u2019t set well with either the pack leader or his second-in-command.\u201d</p><p>Jake looked surprised.</p><p>\u201cI investigated everyone\u2014those in your pack and those who were joining\u2014just as a courtesy to Darien, in the event anything was important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Darien?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to. The woman chose Matthew\u2019s competition. He came here to lick his wounds. Figure that\u2019s why he hadn\u2019t hit on Carol yet. Probably still feels something for the woman who didn\u2019t choose him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you made it sound like he had something to hide.\u201d</p><p>Ryan sniffed the air. \u201cHis own failure.\u201d He suddenly stopped and pointed at the path the three reds had taken this time. \u201cThere. This way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarien said to take them any way we had to. If they fight us, so be it.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded. If he\u2019d gotten hold of the man who\u2019d stolen Carol away before, the man would have been dead\u2014no argument.</p><p>He and Jake quickly stripped off their clothes and shape-shifted. The showdown would be between two grays and three reds, if Ryan had any say about it. Then he bolted through the woods in hot pursuit as Jake skirted around the trees a few yards away.</p><p>At least this way, the reds they were hunting would be far away from Carol, and he figured she\u2019d be safe, no matter who was watching over her.</p><p>For over an hour, they pursued the reds, who were surprisingly speedy. Expecting their next move, the three separated and Jake chased one, while Ryan targeted another. Even if they took only two of them to task, it would show the grays\u2019 strength and possibly stop the reds from trying anything further.</p><p>That\u2019s when Ryan discovered a campsite, tents, a smoldering fire, and tuna cans and cracker wrappers littering the ground. What caught his eye next was that the man he\u2019d been chasing was no longer running as a wolf. Half dressed in a pair of jeans, hairy chest naked, boots unlaced, his face covered in a scruffy red beard and amber eyes narrowed, he pointed a gun at Ryan while he hovered near a pickup, his getaway vehicle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shit. Split-second decision time: lunge at the armed man, or make a hasty turn, try to avoid getting shot in the back of the head, and run in the direction of Silver Town. Tucking tail was not Ryan\u2019s way.</p><p>Before he could leap, he heard the sound of gunfire. The bullet ricocheted off a tree and grazed Ryan\u2019s left foreleg before he reached the bastard. Panicked, the guy fired again twice without aiming. And Ryan darted behind a Douglas fir.</p><p>The bullets struck the tree next to him with a whap... whap! When Ryan came around the tree to take the man down, the red dove into the pickup, slammed the door, charged up the engine, and tore off with the truck leaving a trail of dust in its wake.</p> <p>Hell. Ryan\u2019s foreleg burned even though the bullet wound was superficial, as far as he could tell. He licked the injury, knowing that his wolf saliva could reduce some kinds of bacterial infection and that studies had shown that it could actually aid cell regeneration because of saliva\u2019s epidermal growth factors.</p><p>He howled for Jake, letting him know he had lost his prey and was headed in, but then Ryan caught the whiff of the other man who\u2019d split off from the three and took off after him. Taking care of the flesh wound could wait.</p><p>Jake howled to Ryan in response. A chorus of other wolves let him know where they were and that they\u2019d gotten the message. If the reds weren\u2019t already scared shitless, the sound of all the grays in the woods probably would do the trick.</p><p>Unable to keep up the faster pace he\u2019d used getting there, Ryan finally slowed to a trot for a good long while, his leg bleeding some and the wound still burning, while searching for clues of the third man.</p><p>Jake soon joined him, sniffed his foreleg, and trotted beside him. Ryan couldn\u2019t help but envy Darien and his two brothers. Ryan\u2019s sister meant everything in the world to him, but having someone who acted like a brother to watch his back when they were on the warpath was a unique experience. And welcome.</p> <p>From the looks of it, Jake must have lost his prey also, though.</p><p>While Ryan continued to look for clues of the other man, Jake seemed more concerned about Ryan\u2019s health, glancing back in the direction of the hospital, circling as though he wanted to return. Maybe because Ryan kept limping, although he was trying hard not to. Unable to locate the red, Ryan finally gave up and motioned with his head toward town. Looking relieved, Jake dipped his head once in agreement. The two took off for their stash of clothes.</p><p>When they reached them and then shape-shifted, Ryan fumbled with his shirt. Jake looked like he was about to offer to help him, but Ryan finally managed. \u201cWhat happened to your guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, Jake, I would have been fine. You lost him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol wouldn\u2019t have forgiven me if I\u2019d left you to your injuries and you died. We don\u2019t know if the bullets they\u2019ve been firing are silver or not. And I didn\u2019t know if your wound was superficial or something more serious.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I was wounded when I let everyone know what I was going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGunshots had been fired in the vicinity from which you howled. You said you had lost your prey and were headed in. Not that you were helping me search for the one I was after or the other, but returning to where we\u2019d left our clothes. Which meant you were wounded. Except I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be trying to track down the third guy anyway.\u201d</p><p>Struggling with his belt, Ryan smiled a little. \u201cYou\u2019d make a good detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust an observation of your nature,\u201d Jake said, matter-of-factly, although the way his mouth lifted slightly at the corners, he looked like he appreciated the comment. \u201cStill, you shouldn\u2019t have gone after the other guy.\u201d He yanked on his shirt. \u201cBeing a wounded hero always impresses a lady. Why didn\u2019t I think of that first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d take a bullet just to make points with Carol? I doubt she\u2019d be overjoyed with the prospect.\u201d Ryan snorted. \u201cBesides, a hero solves the crime and saves the damsel in distress. I just managed to get myself shot. Where are the heroics in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the thought that counts.\u201d</p><p>Not feeling in the least bit heroic, Ryan shook his head. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t need looking after. It\u2019s just a graze, and the bullets, thank God, were not silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not trying to kill us.\u201d At least insofar as they didn\u2019t use silver bullets. Shooting a tree hadn\u2019t been the red\u2019s plan, Ryan didn\u2019t think. \u201cBut if they keep trying to take Carol...\u201d Ryan lifted his good shoulder with a slight shrug. \u201cI won\u2019t be responsible for my actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both,\u201d Jake growled. \u201cDarien or Tom either, believe me.\u201d</p><p>After some of the more alpha men had left the hospital to chase after North\u2019s men, North attempted to sneak in as a patient to see Carol. He knew for a fact that Lelandi wasn\u2019t there, so she wouldn\u2019t be on the premises to ID him. For a few minutes, he\u2019d be alone with Carol in an exam room before Doc Weber, who also could identify him, showed up. North patted the hypodermic in his pocket, this time with a much lower tranquilizer dose so that he could sneak Carol out the window. She\u2019d still be on her feet but drowsy and unable to fight him.</p><p>His clammy hands planted in his windbreaker pockets, he tried to look calm instead of on edge as he waited his turn for the nurse to call him. Thankfully, the woman at the desk didn\u2019t seem to think anything of the fact that he specifically had asked for Carol. While he studied a magazine, feigning interest in an article, his focus remained on the receptionist. He was listening to her phone conversations to make sure she didn\u2019t alert anyone about him.</p><p>He figured one of the men sitting in the waiting area was here to guard Carol. Other than him, an elderly balding man in a running suit, two women, one with a small boy, all human, were waiting to be called. North was a walk-in, but the women were, too, so he fit right in.</p><p>His hair unruly, the younger man turned his gaze in the direction of the hall, never once looking at North. Idiot. If he was a guard, he sure would be easy to slip by. The man didn\u2019t seem sick and was definitely a gray. He\u2019d been here before the woman and her little girl arrived, and still he sat without being called.</p><p>The male nurse motioned for the elderly man. \u201cMr. Howard?\u201d The man got up stiffly, grumbled about moving to Florida and the warmer temperatures, and followed the nurse down the hall.</p><p>The guard had been here before the old guy, too. North knew because he\u2019d been watching the place for a good two hours from across the street, away from where his men had been stationed. His men\u2019s ploy had worked, drawing the alphas to chase after them. Hopefully, none of them would get caught and he\u2019d be successful in his mission this time. Even though they\u2019d grumbled about him taking the inside job. They could grouse all they wanted. Carol would be his.</p><p>He swallowed hard. Damn, his throat was raw. A tickle started low in his throat and without being able to quell it, he coughed. Which led to another hacking spell. Hell, he didn\u2019t need to fake being sick, and he figured he was destined for his cousin\u2019s fate soon. Then Carol came down the hall, this time dressed in cat scrubs, her blonde hair bouncing with her step, the memory of her naked in his arms making him hard all over again. He\u2019d almost had her. No way would any of his men have the chance to convince her they suited her better.</p><p>\u201cMr. Graylink?\u201d Carol called out.</p><p>North concealed a sinister smile.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>THE GUARD IN THE HOSPITAL WAITING AREA WAS eyeing Carol until she mentioned North\u2019s made-up name. That\u2019s when he looked over at North and seemed to realize that North might be someone to watch. But the guard didn\u2019t make a move to do anything, and Carol smiled as North stood and walked in her direction, coughing for effect, although the urge to do so was there anyway.</p><p>\u201cHow are we doing, Mr. Graylink?\u201d she asked, walking with him toward the weighing station.</p><p>\u201cBeen sick. Running a fever. Coughing. All stuffed up.\u201d He hated to admit any of it. As a werewolf, usually he just shifted. If it was a human viral condition, his wolf side would knock it out since the flu was nontransferable. Same thing if he had a canine bout of flu. But this time it was different. His cousin was the proof of that.</p><p>North nearly had a heart seizure when he saw Darien\u2019s youngest brother, Tom, watching Carol from the station. Not good. He didn\u2019t realize Tom was here. The alpha male was eyeing him with suspicion. North was too short to be a gray and wearing the hunter\u2019s spray, so Tom couldn\u2019t smell that he was a wolf, either. North had been afraid that if he didn\u2019t use a gray name, he might not get in to see Carol since she was newly turned. Now he was afraid that hiding his scent would create the same problem.</p><p>Tom drew closer, took a deep breath, analyzing the air, and held up his hand. \u201cCarol, you have another patient waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>North coughed again, only this time he couldn\u2019t help it. The damned tickling in his throat wouldn\u2019t stop, yet it was so sore he was ready to rip it out. He cursed Connor for hiring the bioengineer and the man himself for what he had done to their renegade pack.</p><p>\u201cJust this once, Tom.\u201d She smiled at North. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if Tom Silver stays in the exam room with us, do you?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cStalker boyfriend. Have to have a bodyguard around the clock until they catch him.\u201d</p><p>North smiled, hoping his expression didn\u2019t look too evil. Stalker boyfriend. That was about right. But then he looked serious and nodded, even though this was not what he\u2019d had in mind. An exam room alone with Carol, that\u2019s what he\u2019d planned for. He figured he didn\u2019t have much of a choice. Hell. He\u2019d have to knock out Tom and then grab Carol. Hopefully, they wouldn\u2019t make too much of a ruckus and he\u2019d manage to pull this off.</p><p>Tom shook his head. \u201cDarien said only special cases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial\u201d as in lupus garou only because she didn\u2019t have her shifting under control, North assumed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMatthew is seeing a patient,\u201d Carol said, sounding exasperated. \u201cI\u2019ll only be with Mr. Graylink a moment. You\u2019ll be with me. Then Doc will see to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Carol. Darien would have my head on this.\u201d He said to North, \u201cSorry. Please take a seat again in the waiting area. Matthew will be with you in a minute.\u201d</p><p>North cleared his phlegm-filled throat. \u201cProbably nothing the doc can do but order me to get bed rest. Unless I have a sinus infection. Might as well go home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are your symptoms?\u201d Carol asked. He loved the caring way she spoke to him.</p><p>\u201cCarol,\u201d Tom said, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cIf he has a sinus infection, he needs to be on antibiotics,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>\u201cAnd Matthew can take care of it.\u201d Tom wouldn\u2019t back down, but neither would Carol.</p><p>North waited, sweat beading on his forehead.</p> <p>Carol\u2019s gaze shifted, her brows furrowing. \u201cHave you had a fever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne-hundred and one,\u201d North lied. He\u2019d had a fever, but it was low grade and had vanished by the previous morning. \u201cBut that was last night. I didn\u2019t have one this morning. And my teeth have been aching, headache, earache.\u201d Which was true.</p><p>\u201cCome over here, and I\u2019ll get your blood pressure and temperature.\u201d</p><p>Tom folded his arms and glowered at North. In response, North attempted to look demurely sick and un-threatening. Despite feeling lousy, he could still manage a good fight.</p><p>\u201cNo fever,\u201d Carol said, reassuringly. \u201cCome with me, and you can wait in the exam room for Doc.\u201d</p><p>Tom gave her a look like he could throttle her. She ignored him. North hid a smile.</p> <p>When they entered the room, she motioned for him to sit in a chair and held up a chart, waiting to question him about his symptoms. Tom watched him like a predator would, and North wasn\u2019t sure he could overcome Tom and Carol before the alarm was shouted.</p><p>Hell, he was here, and it was his show. Without further hesitation and with a well-aimed swing, he hit Tom with a hard-knuckle fist in the cheek. Tom stumbled back, crashed into the exam table, and swore.</p><p>Carol screamed, and North knew he had no chance to take her now. Still, he jerked a syringe out of his coat pocket, but to his amazement, she pulled one from her scrubs pocket, too. For a moment, they stared at each other, hypodermics readied like two swordsmen in battle. He smiled. The woman was worth having.</p><p>Then he dodged out of the room, shoved aside the male nurse headed for the room, tore down the hall past a startled Dr. Weber, and dove through the back door before a guy in a red-and-white-striped jacket could even get up from his chair. Beta wolf.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Tom?\u201d Carol asked, touching his shoulder and feeling horrible about the whole affair.</p><p>He tossed her an angry look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll... get an ice pack.\u201d</p><p>When she returned to the exam room, Doc was shaking his head.</p> <p>Appearing sheepish, Christian, who had abandoned his guard post in the waiting area too late to have been of any service, and Mervin stood in the doorway watching them and not saying a word, probably thinking that Darien was going to be pissed at the lot of them for letting one of the reds get so close to Carol and then letting him get away.</p><p>Tom glowered at her. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that now,\u201d Carol said, annoyed but also regretful.</p><p>Doc cleared his throat. \u201cThat was North, a red from my old pack. Must have been wearing hunter\u2019s scent. I didn\u2019t smell him as he raced by me. Where the hell is Ryan? I thought he was supposed to be watching you.\u201d The inference was that he wouldn\u2019t have let anyone near Carol like Tom and the rest had.</p><p>She felt bad, too. If she hadn\u2019t insisted on seeing to the patient, wanting to prove that she could still see humans without any threat of shifting so that they would allow her to be a nurse like she should be, Tom wouldn\u2019t have been hurt and in trouble with his eldest brother. Jake would be just as annoyed with him, she figured. And Ryan also.</p><p>Matthew poked his head in. \u201cGot a case where the boy probably needs to be referred to an orthopedic surgeon in Denver, Doc.\u201d</p><p>Doc gave Carol a hard look that reminded her she was one of the pack and had to obey rules. \u201cI\u2019ll see to him,\u201d he said to Matthew.</p><p>Tom took charge of the guards. \u201cMervin, return to your post. Christian, stay outside the exam room until Carol leaves for the day.\u201d</p><p>Feeling like a lupus garou failure, Carol worked for three more hours seeing to one sick patient after another, but she couldn\u2019t help worrying about Ryan and about Tom\u2014knowing she\u2019d caused trouble for him.</p><p>After finishing with another gray female who had the flu, she thought again about Ryan. Even though she didn\u2019t want him getting himself or anyone on the staff in trouble by offering medical advice, she missed his antidotes, all given in the spirit of wanting to help others in need.</p><p>She realized then that he was similar to her in wanting to help others. As a P.I. looking into missing persons or wayward spouses or insurance fraud. As the mayor, trying to provide his people with a better way of life.</p><p>She glanced out the window between patients as Christian sat outside her exam room and served as a guard, while inside the room Tom watched her. He\u2019d finally given up scowling at her and was resigned to his fate, but she hated seeing where the red had struck him, a reminder to her that not everyone could be trusted, sick or not.</p><p>\u201cRyan will be all right,\u201d Tom finally said.</p><p>At the moment, she was worried about how Ryan, Darien, and Jake would react when they learned North had tried to take her again, this time from the hospital, and Tom had gotten clobbered for it.</p><p>\u201cRyan\u2019s been shot three times\u2014an unhappy husband caught in an adulterous affair, one fire insurance fraud case, and a robbery attempt at the bank next door to his P.I. business. He always comes out on top,\u201d Tom continued.</p><p>Carol closed her gaping mouth. \u201cHow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarien checked up on him. You don\u2019t think he hired him to be your bodyguard without seeing if he had the fortitude to do the job, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... if he\u2019s been shot that many times, wasn\u2019t Darien afraid he wouldn\u2019t do the job right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had hundreds of cases over the many years he\u2019s lived. So proportionately, he\u2019s done damn well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really seem to like him,\u201d she said, although Tom had surprised her this time, sounding less harsh concerning Ryan than before when the two were butting heads.</p><p>\u201cI think Jake should be the one for you. Then we\u2019d keep you in the family.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Carol saw that he really did act like a protective brother. She smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet of you. But he\u2019s not shown any real interest.\u201d</p><p>Tom shook his head and winced. \u201cHe\u2019s coming a little too late to the party, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>Her cell phone rang, and she glanced at the Caller ID. Her mother. She\u2019d been so irate every time she and Carol had had a visit recently because someone from the pack always accompanied them. Lelandi, Silva, one of Darien\u2019s brothers. Carol imagined her mother was mad about it again, but Carol couldn\u2019t tell her why Darien always wanted her chaperoned\u2014that she was a newly turned werewolf and might let her \u201ccondition\u201d slip.</p><p>Now with her having been kidnapped, pack members were watching her to an even greater degree. Hopefully her mother did not want to get together again soon, although she had loved to go shopping with Carol or to share a lunch. But how could she explain to her mother that she was being guarded more than usual, again?</p><p>\u201cHello, Mom. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan McKinley called me.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s brain turned to mush. Not in a million years did she think Ryan would call her parents. \u201cHe called you? What about?\u201d Her dad was always a real beta in wolf terms, even though he was human like her mother. Her mother definitely wore the pants in the family.</p><p>Her mother hesitated to say what McKinley had called her about, and Carol didn\u2019t know what to think. \u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him that I sent you to see that psychiatrist?\u201d</p><p>Crap. So was he trying to figure out if she was telling the truth concerning Dr. Metzger\u2019s wife\u2019s death? Ryan was an investigator, she had to remind herself. It was his business to investigate, and he wouldn\u2019t get the truth from Dr. Metzger, not with patient confidentiality issues. But to call her mother...</p><p>\u201cWhat did he ask you, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell him anything. I hung up on him. That\u2019s what I did. He had no business calling me. He\u2019s the one who doesn\u2019t believe in your abilities. Isn\u2019t that what you said? I have no time for people like that. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s interested in dating you. He can\u2019t. And that\u2019s my final word.\u201d</p><p>Carol raised her brows. \u201cI am twenty-six, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you dating him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Carol. You can\u2019t be serious. Your relationships never work out. You need someone who at least believes in what you can do, like your father and I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only had one real relationship. And that was just out of high school.\u201d There was a significant pause, and Carol glanced at the patient\u2019s record again.</p><p>Her mother said, \u201cI want grandkids.\u201d</p><p>Carol bit her lip and looked back at Tom. He was watching out the exam-room window, but she knew he was mentally taking notes of everything she said to her mother. Speaking to any pack member was acceptable. But talking to a human alone, even when that person happened to be her mother? Wouldn\u2019t be allowed. Which was ridiculous. If she made a slip about being a werewolf, would anyone believe her? They\u2019d think she was joking.</p><p>Well, maybe not, since Carol was psychic and her parents had finally had to embrace the fact. What if she spilled the beans to them? They\u2019d be destined to be just like her. Or terminated. According to Lelandi, anyone who learned that lupus garous existed had two choices\u2014become one of them or die. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That seemed cruel, but it was the only way their kind had survived for a millennium or two. Carol could just imagine what would happen if werewolves were found to be real. They\u2019d be treated differently\u2014like outcasts\u2014 and most likely examined ruthlessly.</p><p>The worst of it? They were virtual fountains of youth, living much longer than their human counterparts. What if humans could manufacture whatever anomaly gave werewolves their increased longevity and bottle it? What if everyone wanted to be werewolves?</p><p>Hmm, that could be a good thing, she supposed. No more hiding what they were.</p> <p>\u201cCarol? Did you hear me? I want grandkids,\u201d her mother repeated over the phone.</p><p>Carol took a deep breath. How could she tell her mother that grandkids were out? That they\u2019d be were-kids\u2014and who knew what kind of trouble they could get into? How could she raise little lupus garous when she hadn\u2019t grown up as one and was still fumbling around with her own identity?</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m working at the hospital and need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do plan to have children, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re the only daughter we have left now.\u201d</p><p>The guilt trip again. \u201cI need a guy in my life first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have hung up on Ryan, should I have?\u201d Her mother sounded really sorry for what she\u2019d done.</p><p>Carol smiled. \u201cProbably served him right. Got to go. Talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time you visit, bring Ryan along. I haven\u2019t met him, and I want to make sure he\u2019s all right for you. That is if you\u2019re hell-bent on dating him. I\u2019ll give him a talking-to about your uniqueness.\u201d</p><p>Uniqueness. Even now, her mother couldn\u2019t bring herself to say Carol had psychic abilities. \u201cHe lives in Green Valley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. He told me. Just bring him by sometime. Soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Bye, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAsk him if he wants kids. It\u2019s important to discuss such things with a guy you\u2019re interested in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, if I get interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s interested, Carol, or he wouldn\u2019t have called me.\u201d</p><p>Her mom might not have psychic connections, but she was fairly intuitive when it came to understanding people. Still, Carol figured Ryan had only had one thing on his mind when he called her mother.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he was just going to ask if I truly had a vision about the doctor\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he was. That\u2019s what made me mad. He shouldn\u2019t have to ask. But he wouldn\u2019t have bothered calling me if he wasn\u2019t intrigued with you. And I loved his sexy voice.\u201d</p><p>Even though her mother didn\u2019t like that Darien had moved Carol into his home, or that he or his brothers or Lelandi were always watching her, her mother loved Darien and his brothers\u2019 sexy voices also. There was something about alpha males\u2019 voices that made everyone take notice.</p><p>Call waiting warned Carol that she had someone else on the line. \u201cI have another incoming call, Mom. We\u2019ll have to talk later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, dear. Good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Mom. Thanks for giving me a ring.\u201d</p><p>Carol hung up and then stared at the Caller ID. Rosalind McKinley? Was she Ryan\u2019s sister? It seemed to Carol as though she truly was dating Ryan, the way everyone was calling her about him. At least, that\u2019s what she suspected his sister wanted to talk to her about since Carol had never met Rosalind... or spoken with her before. The day just got weirder and weirder.</p><p>\u201cHello, this is Carol Wood. How may I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Carol, this is Rosalind McKinley, Ryan\u2019s sister. I wonder if Ryan has told you how much he wants you.\u201d</p><p>Carol glanced at Tom, who was trying to listen to her conversation. He set the ice pack down on the counter and folded his arms, his look annoyed. He didn\u2019t budge from the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d Carol asked Rosalind. She already liked the woman for having the gumption to call her. But she wondered if Ryan\u2019s sister really knew what she was talking about or just thought she knew her brother that well.</p><p>\u201cOh, Carol. I can call you Carol, can\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Ryan hasn\u2019t been able to think of anything since he met you five months ago. It was Carol this and Carol that, and dark brooding looks, chopping wood, pacing back and forth, wearing out our carpeting, impossibly distracted whenever I tried to talk with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said nice things about me then?\u201d Carol felt a warm glow.</p><p>\u201cOh, no... not at all.\u201d</p><p>That hit Carol like she\u2019d just been sprayed with a cold shower, dousing the warm, fuzzy feeling at once. \u201cNo? What then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother was obsessed with you. Still is. Mate the poor fool and put him out of his misery. I can\u2019t wait to meet you. No other woman has had this kind of effect on him. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what did he say exactly to you about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had taken tons of pictures of you. He keeps them in the top of the folder, and despite the case being closed, he keeps the file out for handy reference. Not to study the case but to get another look at you. You know what that means, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Carol noted that Rosalind did not exactly say what Ryan had told her about Carol, either.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in love. I\u2019ve never seen him fall so hard for a woman. But I was worried he might not get the message across to you, so I thought I\u2019d better call and let you know how he feels. Just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, thanks.\u201d I think. Carol could just imagine telling Ryan that she understood he loved her and was thrilled he felt that way. He\u2019d look at her like she\u2019d lost her mind.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me! I\u2019m getting a sister!\u201d</p><p>Her comment made Carol smile.</p><p>A commotion ensued in the lobby, garnering Carol\u2019s attention, and Tom moved into the hall to check it out. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to have this conversation later, Rosalind. Thanks so much for calling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we have lunch soon?\u201d</p><p>Carol already really liked Rosalind, her friendliness, enthusiasm, camaraderie. She seemed like someone who\u2019d be in Carol\u2019s court if she needed her. \u201cLunch sounds great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I\u2019m fine, damn it,\u201d Ryan growled in the waiting area down the hall.</p><p>Carol furrowed her brows and glanced back at the hall, but she was unable to see Ryan. The thrill of seeing him back without a scratch was tempered by worry that he\u2019d be angry with Tom... or her... for letting North into the exam room with her.</p><p>Jake said in a scolding tone, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re one of those people who is a horrible patient. If you won\u2019t go peaceably, I\u2019ll have to send you to Matthew to check you out instead of Carol. And you definitely won\u2019t make brownie points there. Guaranteed. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>Her heart tripping, Carol looked at Tom.</p><p>He gave her a wry smile. \u201cGuess that makes four times. Unless he was wounded in some other fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that my brother growling about something?\u201d Rosalind asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him. But I\u2019m not sure what about. I\u2019ve got to go. Trouble at the hospital.\u201d Concerning your brother, but Carol wasn\u2019t about to tell his sister that, in the event it wasn\u2019t anything. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook forward to it.\u201d They disconnected.</p><p>Her blood running cold, Carol shoved the next patient record into the holder. If Ryan had been shot because he was trying to protect her, she didn\u2019t want to even think about it.</p><p>She hurried in the direction of the waiting room.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>WHEN CAROL SAW RYAN\u2019S SHIRTSLEEVE BLOODIED, she frowned and quickened her pace toward the hospital waiting area. \u201cLet\u2019s get you into an exam room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just a graze, for Chr\u2014\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look to curb his tongue. He noted the two small girls in the waiting area and snorted. Then he wordlessly went with her down the hall as she held his arm, his whole body tensing. Touching him made her feel so much more secure. Although she was afraid that once he saw Tom and the goose egg he was sporting, Ryan would be more than furious with the both of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI was chasing one of the reds as a wolf, and when I located him, he shifted and held a gun on me.\u201d</p><p>They approached the exam room as Jake followed behind. \u201cAnd then he fired a shot at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple, but he missed all three times, dove into his pickup, and vamoosed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissed all three times?\u201d She touched the sleeve of his shirt, blood spotting the blue and white print.</p><p>\u201cHe got lucky. One ricocheted off a tree, or he would never have hit me.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cYou went after him even when you learned he had a gun, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Not surprising, but she didn\u2019t like that he took such risks, either. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a hard scowl back, his hands clenched into fists. She felt his muscle tighten beneath her fingertips. \u201cBy lunging at him, I threw him off guard. If I hadn\u2019t, he could have fired several steady shots at my retreating backside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you didn\u2019t continue to chase him,\u201d she scolded.</p><p>\u201cWhile he was driving a pickup? Not likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have thought you might continue to look for clues of the other guys. At least you came straight away here to be treated.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>She looked back at Jake. \u201cYou did come straight here, right?\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head.</p><p>Ryan said, \u201cIf Jake hadn\u2019t insisted, I wouldn\u2019t be here to be examined by you or Doc. I have a job to do, and being a patient is not on the schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you this bad the other times?\u201d</p><p>His expression puzzled, he frowned at her. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were shot the three other times. Did you behave as unruly as a patient before?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was unconscious for two of them.\u201d</p><p>Shocked, she parted her lips.</p><p>That\u2019s when Ryan noticed Tom in the exam room, and his swollen, red cheek. \u201cHell, what happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNorth tried to take her. My fault.\u201d Tom looked guiltily at Jake.</p><p>Jake cursed under his breath and motioned to the break room. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>Silence stretched between Ryan and Carol. She figured he was mad at her already, not even knowing what had happened. She led him into the exam room and shut the door. He still didn\u2019t say anything, which made her more self-conscious than before. \u201cIt was all my fault,\u201d she finally admitted. \u201cNot Tom\u2019s. He insisted Matthew see to the patient. But the man was truly sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a red,\u201d Ryan growled.</p><p>\u201cYes, but we couldn\u2019t smell him. For that reason, Tom wasn\u2019t going to let him see me, thinking he was human.\u201d She guided Ryan across the room and held onto his good arm to help him up on the exam table. Once he was settled, she released him, but she remained standing next to him.</p> <p>\u201cHell, Carol. If you couldn\u2019t smell he was a red or a gray, Matthew should have seen him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. It was my fault,\u201d she reiterated. \u201cI... I just wanted to prove that I could continue to see patients, human or lupus garou, without getting anyone in any trouble.\u201d</p><p>Ryan didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, as if he was really considering why this was so important to her.</p><p>\u201cHe got away.\u201d Ryan sounded resigned and a little weary as he tucked a curl of hair behind her ear. \u201cA guy could get used to a woman fawning over him.\u201d</p><p>The way he\u2019d been acting so reluctant to be examined, she expected him to keep up the resistance. This business with North and the way he\u2019d dropped the subject... well, the change in his attitude totally threw her. Maybe in front of Tom and Jake or anyone like Christian who was within earshot, Ryan felt he had to put on a show. Mostly, she was glad he wasn\u2019t angry with her about her seeing North and putting both Tom and herself at risk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be more careful next time,\u201d she said softly, hating to acquiesce but not willing to get anyone hurt on account of her being so stubborn.</p> <p>She pressed against his knees to unbutton his shirt, but he spread his thighs, pulled her between his legs, and lifted a brow. \u201cEasier to get to the buttons.\u201d He looked like he was attempting to contain a smile. Devilish, desirous, rakish.</p><p>She tried to be professional about this while his legs caged her in, his inner thighs touching her flesh, heating her skin through her scrubs, making her nipples tingle. She should have pushed away, moved to the side of him, but she didn\u2019t imagine standing next to his thigh on the outside would feel any less... erotic.</p><p>All at once, she was reminded of the way he\u2019d touched her earlier that morning in the canopied bed, the way his hands and mouth and body had teased her into submission. Left her body flaming with desire. Even now with their close proximity, the way his hard inner thighs touched her, his face leaning closer to hers, she was growing wet with need.</p><p>Her mind warred with her heart. She wanted to lift her chin and kiss his lips, to wrap her arms around his waist, to hold him close and know he was safe. But Doc would be coming soon.</p><p>She meant to reach up and unbutton Ryan\u2019s shirt and take care of him like a nurse was supposed to, but his hand cupped her chin and his mouth lowered to hers. A quick kiss, she thought. A really... quick... kiss.</p><p>But as soon as she tilted her lips up to meet his, as soon as she closed her eyes to savor the really quick kiss, she was lost. Lost in the way his hands held her hips, keeping her from bolting, lost in the way his alluring mouth firmly pressed against hers, increasing the pressure and gliding over hers, his mouth coaxing hers open. Creating an intimate path between them.</p><p>She moaned and swore he echoed her sentiment, his hands drawing lower and over her buttocks, pulling her against his groin. Despite being wounded, he was hard and wanting all over again. Somehow in her lust-filled thoughts, she heard someone coming as Ryan\u2019s tongue tangled with hers. She paused, momentarily still, rashly wanting to carry on with reckless abandon but knowing she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Ryan released her with a curse under his breath, maybe at himself for losing control, maybe at whoever was headed their way. Maybe at her for getting him all stirred up again.</p> <p>As quickly as she could manage, she unfastened his buttons, feeling aroused and needy and desperate to finish what they\u2019d started. Then she gently tugged the shirt off his shoulders, her hands brushing against his heated skin. She glanced up at him, hoping he was ignoring her. But he wasn\u2019t. His gaze still smoldered with lusty fascination. She cleared her throat and slid the shirt down his arms, trying not to hurt his injured arm.</p><p>He sucked in his breath. \u201cSomehow, I don\u2019t see the nurse removing the patient\u2019s clothes on a regular basis unless the guy\u2019s half dead.\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed when it shouldn\u2019t have, but she wasn\u2019t going to let him stop her from doing her job. \u201cYou\u2019re wounded, Ryan McKinley. It would be too difficult for you to unbutton your shirt with one hand. What am I supposed to do? Watch you struggle in pain? Besides I\u2019m not taking off your trousers.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled wolfishly. Hell, the way they\u2019d been going, she might have done just that!</p><p>\u201cWhat is transpiring between us is strictly business.\u201d At least that had been the plan before he pulled her between his legs and began kissing her.</p><p>Whoever was walking toward the room had already passed by, and Carol took a relieved breath. Attempting to ignore the way Ryan heated her to the core and to do her duty as a trained nurse, she wiped away the blood on his arm, glad to see that the bullet had only grazed him like he\u2019d said. Given werewolves\u2019 advanced healing capabilities, the wound should heal sufficiently by morning.</p><p>Ryan took hold of her free hand and looked into her eyes as if he was ready to analyze her every reaction.</p><p>\u201cDid you see any visions of this or of anything else?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Unsure whether he still didn\u2019t believe her, she sighed. \u201cNo. If I had, I would have warned you.\u201d She pulled away from him and cleansed the wound. She thought of Rosalind\u2019s call to her, but before that, her mother\u2019s and planned to ask him about both.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, why did you call my mother?\u201d</p><p>Ryan didn\u2019t look in the least bit sheepish, which surprised her. \u201cI called to see if she believed you had psychic abilities after she had sent you to that damned psychiatrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she didn\u2019t believe in my talents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d tell her what a marvel you are.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her lips parted. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously. Only she hung up on me, which didn\u2019t bode well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat difference does it make if she believes me or not?\u201d</p><p>He rested his hands on her hips and pulled her close to his body. \u201cBecause we\u2019re dating. Remember?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a ladylike snort. \u201cRight.\u201d Yet it gave her hope he truly did believe her, and her whole spirit lifted.</p><p>Before she could ruin the feeling and ask him what he\u2019d said to his sister about her that was not complimentary, Doc Weber opened the door. The doctor raised his brows to see Ryan on the exam table and Carol standing between his legs, ministering to him. She was grateful Doc hadn\u2019t seen them kissing earlier.</p><p>She noticed how tired Doc looked, with dark circles under his eyes and his shoulders stooped. He was a red from Lelandi\u2019s former pack, here to doctor the patients until they could find a gray. But he planned to stay until Lelandi had her babies. He\u2019d taken Carol under his wing because she was a nurse, newly turned, and a red like him.</p><p>Because she\u2019d been turned by one of his former pack, Doc considered Carol like one of his family. Since he\u2019d never had a mate and no offspring, she and Lelandi were like the daughters he\u2019d never had. That meant he kept giving them fatherly lectures. Since Lelandi was mated, though, she didn\u2019t receive as many as Carol did.</p><p>Carol moved a respectable distance from Ryan while Doc examined his wound. \u201cI thought you were posted here as her bodyguard. What happened?\u201d His tone was accusatory. What good would Ryan be if he didn\u2019t stay and watch over her?</p><p>\u201cTom was keeping an eye on her while I took after the men. By the looks of it, I should have stayed. They\u2019re intent on shooting anyone who tries to stop their mission, but they don\u2019t have the nerve to fight wolf to wolf. You probably know them. Three reds from Lelandi\u2019s and your former pack?\u201d</p><p>The doc peered closely at the wound and shook his head. \u201cThe men who were left behind were decent sorts. None of them would do a thing like this.\u201d</p><p>Except North? And the others with him had to be from the same pack.</p><p>Ryan pursed his lips tight and didn\u2019t say anything to Doc, but Carol thought he wanted to. How could the men be \u201cdecent sorts\u201d when they had taken Carol from the house like they did? And they had to be from Lelandi\u2019s pack. No other red pack lived in the area. And what about this latest clash with North and Tom?</p><p>\u201cNot a silver bullet, anyway. So it appears they don\u2019t mean to kill anyone,\u201d Doc said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d Carol\u2019s tone was filled with relief but concern, too, that this wasn\u2019t ending anytime soon.</p><p>A flash of memory of the shooting she\u2019d witnessed at the hospital the previous fall suddenly swamped her with regret. The doctor had lain dead on the exam-room floor, his nurse just as unresponsive. She wasn\u2019t sure what had brought the memory back. The attack on Tom maybe. Or the one on Ryan since he\u2019d been shot, or both. Or the idea that it would happen again and be fatal this time?</p><p>Carol turned away quickly as tears filled her eyes, not wanting Doc and Ryan to see her like this\u2014unable to control her emotions. Everyone expected her to be strong, both in the workplace and around family. She was the one who held up through any crisis. When her sister died, she had helped her parents get through it. She had to be resilient when others needed her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Doc cleared his throat. \u201cJust apply some of that salve and bandage it, and he should be back to doing his job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dr. Weber.\u201d Carol tried to hide the hitch in her voice. She hated when she got emotional on the job.</p><p>\u201cCarol,\u201d Doc said, his voice soft and consoling.</p> <p>Unable to look him directly in the eye, she fought to hold back the burning tears. \u201cYes, Doctor?\u201d</p><p>He looked sympathetically at her and then patted her shoulder. \u201cGot another case of the flu to look after.\u201d He walked out of the room, his movement slower and stiffer than usual.</p><p>She wanted to tell him he needed to take care of himself. That he should get more rest, but she knew it would be futile. She wondered, though, what he\u2019d intended to say. That the other doctor and nurse dying hadn\u2019t been her fault?</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t her mistake, she tried to convince herself. The miner who killed them was the one responsible. But if she\u2019d only raised the alarm somehow before he shot them...</p><p>Still, maybe that\u2019s why the memory haunted her again. That it had been her fault, just like Tom\u2019s having been attacked was, too. And if the reds hadn\u2019t been trying to take her hostage, Ryan wouldn\u2019t have been harmed, either.</p> <p>\u201cCarol?\u201d Ryan said, drawing her from her mental self-bashing. He left the exam table and touched her arm. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey died because of me.\u201d She pulled away from him and stood in front of a supply drawer, staring at it but not seeing it.</p><p>\u201cThe former doctor and that nurse?\u201d His voice was gentle, and no matter how badly she felt, his tone was like a mental salve. He ran his hand over her back in a gentle caress.</p><p>Carol let out her breath. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been there, done that, Carol.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and stared at him in disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Only it was my job to protect those who ended up dying. In this case, you were an innocent bystander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot an innocent bystander at all. I knew they\u2019d come to harm. I didn\u2019t...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t save them. Even after they had been shot. I didn\u2019t remove the bullets fast enough.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and held her tight. The patient comforting the nurse. It was wrong. Everything about this was wrong. But she couldn\u2019t push him away. She needed this. She needed him. The warmth. The security. No pressure. Just concerned friendship. For the moment.</p><p>His hand swept down her back, massaging the tension from her stiff spine. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know what they were, what we were. You didn\u2019t know that the silver could kill or that if you\u2019d removed the bullets quickly enough, they might have survived. You reacted the way your nurse\u2019s training had prepared you. You couldn\u2019t have known that Doc and the nurse were different from you, or how to take care of an injured lupus garou. You did the best you could under the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him through tears and saw his face frowning with concern. \u201cI wish my visions had told me that part of the equation. But they\u2019re irritatingly scant and...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a curse I have to bear.\u201d Just like having to shape-shift against her will was now. And damn, if she could keep it at bay, she would. She turned, opened the drawer, and retrieved antibiotics and a bandage.</p><p>She motioned to the exam table. \u201cDo you want to sit up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI normally hate anything to do with hospitals,\u201d Ryan said, his tone lighthearted, as if he was trying to change the somber mood. He sat on the table and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, trying for professionalism again. \u201cHere I thought you were going to be a difficult patient.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith you tending to me?\u201d</p><p>With as light a touch as she could manage, she dressed his wound with the antibiotic and then wrapped the bandage around his arm. He stiffened, but when she looked up to see if he was hurting, he cast her an elusive smile. \u201cOn the scale of one to ten, the pain is nonexistent. Your hands are cold.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him and secured the bandage. \u201cI didn\u2019t touch you with my cold hands. You don\u2019t have to be macho for me. I know it has to hurt.\u201d She handed him his shirt.</p><p>He pulled it on while she watched, ready to help him if he needed further assistance.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why Darien and the others shift in the visions but can\u2019t shift back?\u201d he asked, surprising her.</p><p>She thought he already believed her. She folded her arms, unable to avoid feeling defensive. \u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so frustrating. I thought you believed me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I normally don\u2019t put much stock in psychic abilities. Not in supernatural entities, ghosts, or any of that stuff.\u201d</p><p>Just as she suspected. \u201cThen if I told you I\u2019ve had a ghostly experience, you wouldn\u2019t believe me?\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved up a hint, his eyes sparkling with amusement. \u201cMy Aunt Tilda sees them all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, and you don\u2019t put much stock in your Aunt Tilda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite the contrary. I find her about the most well-grounded of my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for the ghostly visits.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and winced, and then began buttoning his shirt. \u201cShe needs lots of attention. I imagine she conjures them up when she\u2019s lonely.\u201d</p><p>Carol leaned in between his legs to fasten a couple of buttons on his shirt. \u201cAnd me?\u201d</p><p>He touched her hair in a loving way. \u201cYou\u2019ve just had the one experience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree, but who\u2019s counting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have faith in your abilities, by the way.\u201d</p><p>She closed her gaping mouth. She had hoped, but... she hadn\u2019t realized he thought she\u2019d told the truth. Tears filled her eyes again. \u201cYou really do?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her close, rubbing her shoulders in a gentle manner. \u201cYeah, Carol. I really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She sighed deeply. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how much that means to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine I do.\u201d He leaned down to kiss her lips, but she pulled away before they got too involved again. \u201cI\u2019ve got another patient to see, last one of the day. Another case of the sniffles. Everyone thinks they have the deadly flu when most of the cases are colds or allergies. I\u2019ll see to him while you finish dressing.\u201d</p><p>His expression hardening, Ryan went back to buttoning his shirt and followed her into the hall. \u201cHow am I going to guard you if I\u2019m not with you?\u201d</p><p>She harrumphed. \u201cAnd just how did you get that?\u201d She pointed at his bloody sleeve.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to protect you away from your workplace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit it. You\u2019d rather chase down the bad guys than play the wait-and-see game.\u201d</p><p>He smiled darkly.</p><p>When she called out the name from the chart and Ryan saw who her next patient was, his dark expression lightened up a lot.</p><p>The gray-haired old man shuffled toward Carol and gave her a small smile. \u201cYou brighten an old man\u2019s day, young\u2019en.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, Luciso, you always make my day.\u201d</p><p>Luciso glanced at Ryan, took in his bloody shirtsleeve, and shook his head. \u201cIs he the one everyone\u2019s saying is hitting on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bodyguard,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>Luciso snorted. \u201cLooks like this business with the reds is going to get real nasty. You tell Darien if he needs an old guy to help out, I\u2019m ready and willing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Luciso. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll appreciate the offer.\u201d She heard the doc coughing and glanced down the hall. \u201cAre you all right, Dr. Weber?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing home to get some rest, Carol. Pulled an all-nighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep well,\u201d she said, but then a sickening feeling washed over her as she envisioned the doctor shape-shifting into the wolf to knock out his illness. She hurried after him, leaving her patient behind in her haste, figuring Ryan would catch up to her. But she had to warn Doc not to shift. He\u2019d think she was crazy, but she just had to warn him.</p><p>\u201cWait, Dr. Weber! I need a word with you!\u201d she said as the door slammed shut.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>\u201cHELL, NORTH, ALL YOU DID WAS GET US INTO DEEPER guano by stirring them up at the hospital,\u201d Galahad said, pacing across the meadow, at least thirty miles from Silver Town.</p><p>\u201cAt least I got a shot off at that outsider gray. Once that happened, the majority of them turned around and hightailed it out of there,\u201d Hank said grinning. \u201cWe might not be as good in a fight with them wolf to wolf, but they can\u2019t argue with bullets.\u201d</p><p>North shook his head. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Darien\u2019s brother watching over Carol, I would have had her. The others guarding her were clueless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Hank said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to injure the gray that badly. I just want to get Carol. Hell, they\u2019ve got the damned hospital watched, every entryway inside and outside. No grabbing her there from now on, it looks like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, unless some of them start having the same trouble we\u2019re having,\u201d Galahad said. \u201cBoth Marilee and Becky went in today since they\u2019re feeling so poorly. At least they shared the flu at the gathering last night, although they should have arrived earlier to expose more folks. If nothing else, when Darien\u2019s people get sick, they\u2019ll have to try and find a cure. Damn that Miller anyway. He promised the vaccine he gave us beforehand would keep us from getting sick and be a cure for those who already have the virus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI blame Connor for paying the guy to create the virus in the first place. I wonder if Miller lied to us about staying isolated from the rest of us while he tries to find a vaccine that works this time. Hell, what if he already has one and inoculated only himself against the virus?\u201d North asked. He\u2019d kill the guy.</p><p>\u201cWhat good would it do him if all of us came down with it but him?\u201d Galahad asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d North reluctantly admitted, shoving his hands in his pockets. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Unless he figures he\u2019ll rescue those of us he wants to when the time is right and leave the rest of us to deal with the condition. As wolves, except for trying to kill him, we wouldn\u2019t have any way to resolve this issue. What if Carol ends up having the same problem?\u201d He scowled in the direction of Silver Town. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Galahad threw his hands up in an aggravated posture. \u201cWhat about Doc? Surely he\u2019ll know we weren\u2019t troublemakers and he\u2019ll help us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Hank agreed with his brother. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I took a swing at Tom, I doubt Doc will be very agreeable. He\u2019s there because the other doctor died and because Lelandi\u2019s mother wants Doc Weber here for Lelandi when her babies are due. The town needs a doctor right now. He\u2019s not going to leave his responsibilities behind.\u201d</p> <p>Hank cleared his throat. \u201cNot for long, North. But maybe he\u2019d have some ideas. What can it hurt? We can just call him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. But as soon as we do, he\u2019ll know who we all are and who\u2019s been trying to grab Carol. Just remember that. His loyalty is to Lelandi and her family, not to us.\u201d North snapped open his phone and punched in Doc\u2019s number.</p><p>Mervin jumped up from his chair at the back door of the hospital. He prevented Carol from leaving by blocking the door with his body as she tried to reach Doc Weber before he took off in his car. Luckily, Mervin didn\u2019t grab her this time.</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cLet me through, Mervin. I have to speak to Doc.\u201d</p><p>Ryan joined her and shook his head. \u201cWhat part of I\u2019m to protect you at all times don\u2019t you remember, Carol?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell him to let me out of the building so I can talk to Doc!\u201d</p><p>Ryan opened the door and stepped outside. \u201cHis car\u2019s gone. He\u2019s already headed for home. What did you want to speak with him about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s personal.\u201d She headed back down the hall. \u201cI\u2019ll see my last patient and then call Doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it about?\u201d Ryan appeared concerned.</p><p>\u201cWhat I envisioned would happen to him. All right? He might not believe me either, but I have to warn him.\u201d \u201cWhy now? Why not before?\u201d</p><p>She appreciated that he really wanted to know how this early warning system worked. \u201cBecause I feel like it\u2019s going to come to pass soon. Sometimes I have this impending feeling of doom, and all of a sudden, the scene I\u2019ve envisioned becomes a reality. That\u2019s why.\u201d</p> <p>Trying to hide her frustration, she finished working with her last patient and grabbed the work phone as soon as he left the exam room. When she auto-dialed Doc\u2019s number, all she got was his answering machine. Discouraged, she put the receiver back on the base.</p><p>\u201cHe looked exhausted,\u201d Ryan offered, running his hand over Carol\u2019s arm in a consoling way, but she couldn\u2019t relax. He rested his hands on her shoulders and considered her glum expression. \u201cHe needed to sleep. And that\u2019s probably just what he\u2019s doing. You do also, after you get a good meal.\u201d</p><p>She was wired, and no amount of consolation was going to change that. She had to warn Doc. \u201cI want to run by his place before we go home.\u201d</p><p>Jake and Tom joined them in the waiting room, while Mervin reluctantly went with Christian, who was dropping him off at his place.</p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d Jake asked, noting the tension between Ryan and Carol, she thought.</p><p>\u201cCarol\u2019s worried about Doc,\u201d Ryan said, his hand lightly rubbing her back.</p><p>\u201cHe appeared not to be feeling well. I want to check on him.\u201d Carol gave Ryan a look like he\u2019d better not say one word about her warning Doc about shape-shifting. Even though she didn\u2019t think Doc would believe her, she had to tell him anyway. Just in case.</p><p>\u201cHe worked all night. He\u2019ll be sleeping. You know how he is,\u201d Jake said.</p> <p>Carol frowned at Jake. \u201cHe was coughing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a doctor. He\u2019ll know to take care of himself,\u201d Jake countered. \u201cBesides, with our faster werewolf healing ability, he\u2019ll be fine in no time. And if he has the flu, he can shift and that will take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Which was precisely what she was afraid would happen!</p><p>Carol stalked off for the hospital entrance. She continued to be plagued by the overwhelming fear that Doc could be in trouble. \u201cIn your P.I. business, you get hunches, don\u2019t you, Ryan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Jake and Tom followed behind, and she knew they were listening to her conversation, even though she kept her voice low for Ryan\u2019s hearing and not for anyone else\u2019s. But their hearing was too darned good. And when she was upset, they took notice. Probably figured she might all of a sudden shift into a wolf.</p><p>She slowed her walk. Hell, what if being highly distressed, more than the physical manhandling she\u2019d had to endure when Mervin roughly grabbed her, could trigger the change? She took an unsteady breath and said to Ryan, \u201cThink of my premonitions as a hunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>They exited the building, and Tom and Jake paused to see Carol safely to Ryan\u2019s truck. She climbed inside and folded her arms, not about to be stopped from completing her mission.</p><p>\u201cDrive me to Doc\u2019s place. It\u2019ll only take a moment. I\u2019ve got a key to his house because I care for his houseplants when he visits Lelandi\u2019s old pack on occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only use it to make sure he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>In a humorous way, Ryan arched a brow. \u201cWhat if he\u2019s got a girlfriend over?\u201d</p><p>Carol rolled her eyes.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNever know. Can never judge a person\u2019s sex life by their age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he won\u2019t.\u201d Although she wished he had, but as haggard as Doc had looked, she was sure he\u2019d be alone.</p><p>Ryan started the engine. \u201cAll right, give me directions.\u201d</p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief, although she wasn\u2019t sure she was going to make any headway with Doc. He\u2019d never said one way or another if he believed in her abilities. She figured he\u2019d be like Ryan... a man of science, having to see it to believe it, which made her wonder why Ryan finally believed her without proof positive.</p><p>As soon as Ryan parked the truck at Doc\u2019s rental house, a neat little clapboard house with a white picket fence surrounding it, she noted the sign hanging above the door. The sign welcomed visitors, which was just like Doc. If patients needed him when he wasn\u2019t on duty, they were welcome to come to see him at anytime.</p><p>Carol jumped out of the truck before Ryan could exit the vehicle. She hurried to Doc\u2019s door, afraid Jake would try to stop her. Ryan stalked after her, his footfalls getting closer. After knocking and not getting a response, she unlocked the door. She saw Jake park behind Ryan\u2019s vehicle as she hurried inside, hoping she could speak with Doc before he might decide to shift and it would be too late.</p><p>To forestall any disagreement, Ryan waited on the porch to talk to Jake and Tom, who were hurrying up the walk. \u201cShe\u2019s just checking on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has his key? Hell, what if the old guy has a girlfriend?\u201d Jake shook his head and folded his arms, while both of them stared into the dark house.</p><p>Tom watched in the other direction, making sure no one visited the house who shouldn\u2019t be there, just like they shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Jake suddenly turned to Ryan, his eyes widening. \u201cShe had a premonition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Well, just a feeling, from what I understand.\u201d At least he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d had a new vision. And he wasn\u2019t giving away the vision she\u2019d had of several of them shape-shifting and not turning back. Not unless she wanted him to.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t appear right away, they walked into the living room. Carol hurried down the hallway, waving for them to leave.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sleeping soundly,\u201d she whispered, looking vastly relieved.</p><p>Ryan took her comment to mean that Doc was still in his human form.</p><p>In the kitchen, the phone rang. Carol instinctively ran to get it, but Ryan grabbed her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be here,\u201d he said, his voice hushed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want the phone to wake Doc.\u201d She paused as the answering machine came on.</p><p>\u201cHey, Doc. I called earlier but didn\u2019t leave a message. This is North Redding, and we\u2019ve got a bit of trouble here.\u201d</p><p>Carol trembled, and Ryan put his arm around her shoulders and pulled her close as if he was protecting her from the menace.</p><p>\u201cWe really could use your help. We\u2019re no longer with Lelandi\u2019s pack but started our own. If you could see your way to helping us out, we\u2019d sure appreciate it. I\u2019ll call back later to see if you\u2019re agreeable.\u201d</p><p>The connection disconnected.</p><p>Ryan rubbed Carol\u2019s arm. \u201cWas that one of the men who took you hostage?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe one who carried me. He\u2019d spoken to the others when he took me hostage the first time. I\u2019d recognize his voice anywhere. He\u2019s the same one who hit Tom when we were in the exam room. Doc identified him by name.\u201d</p><p>Jake said to Tom, \u201cI want you to stay here and watch over Doc. I\u2019ll send others to help look after him in case North tries to take him hostage. Can you manage it?\u201d</p><p>Tom nodded. \u201cHell, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorth was sick, and maybe others in his pack are also. If they need our help...\u201d Carol said, letting her words trail off.</p><p>\u201cWhy go after Carol and the doc? Why not contact either of the other nurses?\u201d Tom asked.</p><p>\u201cNorth and his men are reds,\u201d Ryan reasoned. \u201cEven though Doc is, too, I imagine they went after Carol first because they wanted to keep her in their pack. Then when they figured it was going to be too difficult to try for her again, they decided to solicit Doc\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep him safe,\u201d Tom said. \u201cJust let any of them try to break in.\u201d</p><p>Jake slapped him on the back. \u201cI\u2019ll send Deputy Trevor and a couple of other men over to watch the outside. Let us know at once if anything happens.\u201d</p><p>Ryan headed out to the truck with Carol and Jake, leaving Doc under Tom\u2019s protection. \u201cYou might have someone posted to watch out for the other two nurses, just in case North and his men go after them, figuring they can\u2019t wait for Doc\u2019s help,\u201d Ryan said to Jake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHell.\u201d Jake flipped open his phone and punched in a number. \u201cDarien, we\u2019ve got a new situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you at the house,\u201d Ryan said to Jake. Jake gave him the thumbs-up, and Ryan led Carol to his own truck.</p><p>When they were on their way to Darien\u2019s home, Ryan asked. \u201cDoc was all right, correct?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Carol rubbed her arms and still appeared unsettled.</p><p>\u201cGood thing you wanted to check on him. If we hadn\u2019t learned of North\u2019s interest in him, we might not have discovered what they were up to until it was too late. Whoever\u2019s sick can be brought here. And none of the medical staff is going to them. Certainly not after what they pulled with you. Are you sure you didn\u2019t have a premonition of the phone call? It seems odd that you were so desperate to go there, and we find he\u2019s just sleeping, but then we learn of North\u2019s interest in the doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a vision of anything. Just a strong feeling. And since the last vision I had was of Doc not being able to shift back, that\u2019s what I feared this was all about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we established that you don\u2019t see lengthy visions, that he could very well shift later on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his wolf form, he\u2019s agitated. I can\u2019t see where he is, but it\u2019s like he\u2019s caged in. Like he\u2019s stuck.\u201d</p> <p>He could allow that she \u201cfelt\u201d something. She was correct in assuming that he\u2019d have a hunch about a situation and know danger was present, or that someone was lying to cover their illicit deeds. Nothing that he could prove in a court of law. Just that elusive feeling.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t help feeling that something more had triggered her need to be at Doc\u2019s house at the right moment. Something that was a little more than a hunch. Something like a sixth sense that went beyond what he normally believed in.</p><p>Silence filled the air as he thought about Doc being in his wolf form, pacing and anxious, and what could bring that about. \u201cMaybe he just does that normally, Carol.\u201d</p><p>She turned to stare at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc. Maybe he turns into the wolf and paces when he\u2019s agitated sometimes. All of us handle situations differently. My Aunt Tilda likes to take a nap as a wolf. As a human, she feels she isn\u2019t allowed. To her way of thinking, only children take naps. But as a wolf, she feels it\u2019s acceptable. So maybe when Doc Weber is stressed, he shape-shifts. To an extent, it does change who we are for a while. It\u2019s a different sort of freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he does shift for that reason,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t have a vision of something that is perfectly normal for him.\u201d</p> <p>Silence stretched between them as Ryan mulled that over. \u201cDo you see more pieces of the vision later on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. Mostly it\u2019s just the same spot in time, the same image. Like with Mervin tackling me.\u201d</p><p>Despite not having any confirmation that what she envisioned could come to pass, Ryan was beginning to worry for Doc, too.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>TWENTY MINUTES LATER, RYAN PULLED INTO DARIEN\u2019S drive, unable to let go of Carol\u2019s concern over Doc or his own worry that she might be right. He turned off the ignition and spoke to Carol as Jake pulled in behind him and parked.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you didn\u2019t have another premonition about Doc that triggered your concern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain. Why do you keep asking?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and opened his door. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe your premonitions have... gotten me to thinking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou felt something, too?\u201d Her eyes were wide. \u201cA hunch that maybe something wasn\u2019t right?\u201d</p><p>Or maybe her worry was feeding into his psyche. Almost as if her concern for a future unknown event had sensitized him to the possibility that it existed. He shook his head at himself, she sighed, and he closed his door. Before he could reach hers, Jake was already there again, helping her out.</p><p>Darien headed outside to speak to them. \u201cI don\u2019t want Lelandi to know about this latest development concerning North and his men. She\u2019s to be under guard as usual until we settle this. But it appears that the hospital staff are most likely the targets this time. Tom called and said Doc woke to find him there, was coughing his head off, and decided to shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carol said, her voice hushed as her hand flew to her breast.</p><p>Ryan caught her free arm as she wobbled on her feet.</p><p>Darien frowned. \u201cHe thought he\u2019d feel better. Sometimes our wolf halves can handle colds or allergies better. If it\u2019s the flu, canines can\u2019t catch the human variety. So it would knock it out. Anyway, if it\u2019s any of the more common stuff, sometimes shifting will lessen the symptoms. But he\u2019ll know before long and can change back if need be. \u201d</p><p>Carol looked pale and distraught.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside,\u201d Darien said, studying her. \u201cLelandi\u2019s got supper on.\u201d</p><p>His arm around her waist, Ryan walked Carol into the house and whispered to her, \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure... sure, I\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Tom staying the night with Doc?\u201d Ryan asked Darien.</p><p>\u201cYeah. The sheriff is running by there to watch the area, too, and a couple of other men also. He\u2019s well safeguarded.\u201d Darien motioned for Jake to take Carol into the dining room. \u201cI want a word with you, Ryan.\u201d He walked Ryan back outside as Jake led a reluctant Carol into the dining room. \u201cHave you learned how Carol is stopping the shift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVisions.\u201d</p><p>Darien raised his brows. \u201cReally.\u201d He said the word with awe, but then he frowned. \u201cCan she always control it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf her panic in attempting to reach her bedroom after Mervin accosted her is any indication, I\u2019d say no. She stopped the shift, but I think she was awfully close to changing until she was able to control the urge.\u201d</p><p>Looking thoughtful, Darien rubbed the dark stubble on his chin. \u201cNot good. If she doesn\u2019t have any real power over it\u2014which would be expected since she\u2019s newly turned, although some have better control than others\u2014she\u2019s going to be real trouble. Can you convince her to shift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I believe she\u2019ll continue to try and avoid it through her visions. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way that I can convince her to accept that part of our werewolf nature. At least for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have faith in her visions now?\u201d</p><p>As much as Ryan had a hard time trusting in anything of the sort, he did. \u201cYeah, I do. Even though it goes against everything I\u2019ve ever believed in. I did try a psychic once in my line of work, but she turned out to be a fraud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Darien said, his lips curving up slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d Ryan was used to doing the investigations, not being investigated.</p><p>\u201cWhen someone gets interested in joining the pack or shows interest in one of my pack members, I have him or her checked out. I owe it to my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you discovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll about your faux psychic. If that had happened to any of my pack members, the man who threatened you with libel and the woman who was a phony psychic would have been leaving town for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem with Green Valley being a human-run town for the most part. We want more of what you have here in Silver Town, where you and your brothers run things.\u201d</p><p>Darien nodded. He didn\u2019t say anything for several lengthy moments, studying Ryan the whole time, and then he asked, \u201cWhat if you mated her?\u201d</p><p>Darien could have knocked Ryan over with the question, it surprised him so. He observed the Douglas firs shuddering in the breeze. He hadn\u2019t planned on taking a mate. Hadn\u2019t been looking for one. Yet ever since he\u2019d met the determined woman five months ago and had seen her heroics, her determination to help save others in need, no matter the consequences to her own life, he couldn\u2019t deny that he\u2019d been thinking along those lines.</p><p>The way Carol reacted to him physically was a sure indication that the wolf side of them was well aware of the interest they had in each other. After Carol had caressed his plaid in the truck and he envisioned himself wearing it while she continued to touch the fabric so intimately, he\u2019d again envisioned her being his mate. They\u2019d partake in the Celtic festivities, even if he was a McKinley and she was a MacDonald. He\u2019d wrap her in his plaid and show her just what a Highlander of old was capable of.</p><p>He looked back to see Darien waiting for a response. Would Ryan be able to convince her to shape-shift if he mated her?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure she\u2019d shape-shift if I mated her. She\u2019s pretty stubborn.\u201d</p><p>Darien snorted. \u201cTell me about it. Come on. I know Carol\u2019s concerned about something, and I want to find out what.\u201d He slapped Ryan on the back. \u201cLet\u2019s get something to eat before we upset Lelandi by letting the food get cold.\u201d</p><p>When they entered the dining room, Darien said to Carol, \u201cYou seemed concerned that Doc had shifted. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She gave a heavy sigh as he watched her, his brows furrowed. Ryan was sure that if she told Darien what she\u2019d envisioned, he wouldn\u2019t believe her. Even if he might believe her about her other premonitions. But then again, Ryan wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d even tell him what she\u2019d seen.</p><p>With an expression that bordered on insubordination, she straightened her shoulders, looked Darien in the eye, and said, \u201cI see Doc, you, and Jake shift into your wolf forms, but none of you can shift back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Darien\u2019s whole expression lightened several degrees. \u201cCan\u2019t happen. Sometimes we stay in our wolf persona for hours or days. Depends on the circumstances. But your visions are only fragments of time, so I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d She sat in the chair Ryan pulled out for her as Jake brought in a platter of hickory-smoked brisket. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t even tell you I told you so when it happens.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThe point will be moot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The aroma of brisket and dark-brown gravy filled the air. Broccoli and cauliflower sat in a separate serving dish. Mashed potatoes were piled high on another, and Ryan\u2019s stomach growled.</p><p>Smiling, Lelandi pulled off an apron, looking very domestic for a change. Ryan helped bring in a platter of bread, while Jake hurried to carry in the other dishes.</p><p>\u201cPoor Tom doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s missing,\u201d Jake said, a little too evilly. \u201cGuess there will be more for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Tom?\u201d Lelandi asked casually.</p> <p>Darien\u2019s expression darkened, but then he put his hand around Lelandi\u2019s shoulders and guided her to the table.</p><p>\u201cDoc\u2019s got a cold, and Carol was worried about him. Tom is staying the night to make sure he doesn\u2019t get worse.\u201d</p><p>Carol and Lelandi shared looks. Lelandi had to know that wasn\u2019t what Carol was concerned about. Then Carol opened up her phone, punched in a number, and said, \u201cHey, Tom? Tell me the minute Doc shifts back into his human form, okay?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi hesitated to sit at the table.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Carol hung up her phone and gave Lelandi a wilted smile. \u201cThe meal looks terrific. Wish I could cook like this.\u201d</p> <p>Lelandi managed a laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t believe her. She\u2019s a great cook.\u201d</p><p>Everyone took their seats.</p><p>Jake scooped a pile of mashed potatoes onto his plate from a large bowl. \u201cYep, except she\u2019s very nutrition conscious. Makes us eat the right amounts of veggies and fruits with all our meals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be the one who has to tell you to eat right, Jake.\u201d Carol forked some beef onto her plate and then handed the platter to Lelandi.</p><p>Ryan could feel the tension between the two women, the unspoken words, the shuttered looks. With Darien and his brother, the tension vibrated between them also, but for a different reason. He was sure they didn\u2019t take Carol seriously on this issue and were more concerned about North\u2019s message to Doc. And the possibility the reds were targeting more of the medical staff than they had first bargained on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be moving into our grandfather\u2019s house in a couple of months,\u201d Jake announced, stirring gravy into his potatoes and trying to change the subject, no doubt. \u201cShould be livable by then.\u201d</p> <p>Lelandi sighed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to move.\u201d</p><p>Darien took her hand and squeezed. \u201cBelieve me, he has to. Once three new babies are in the house, he\u2019ll have to find his solitude elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Jake nodded. \u201cThe old place needs another coat of paint, some new plumbing, and some other minor repairs. But after that, it should be ready to move in. Tom and I\u2019ve taken care of updating all the electrical wiring, and the chimney is cleaned out and ready to use. He said he\u2019ll live with me for the time being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d Darien sipped a beer.</p><p>Lelandi took another deep breath. \u201cI\u2019d hoped you would be our babysitter when we went out nights.\u201d</p><p>Jake laughed. \u201cSilva\u2019s already put her name on the long list of babysitters. Even got Sam rooked into it. And I know for a fact the list is growing daily.\u201d</p><p>Carol sipped some of her wine but didn\u2019t say a word. She looked consumed with worry, although she tried to smile at the conversation.</p><p>Darien\u2019s phone rang, and he lifted it off his belt. \u201cYeah, Tom?\u201d His brow pinched together in a frown. \u201cTom, what\u2019s... Tom!\u201d He quickly rose from his chair and headed for the door.</p> <p>Jake hurried after him.</p><p>\u201cCall the alert roster. North and his men approached Doc\u2019s house. Tom\u2019s cell phone went dead after that. You stay here with Ryan to protect the women,\u201d Darien said to Jake.</p><p>Lelandi sat frozen to her chair. Carol joined her and rubbed her shoulder. Ryan checked out the front window, looking for anyone who shouldn\u2019t be there, while Jake called someone. \u201cCall the alert roster. Tom\u2019s in trouble at Doc\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed off as he left the dining room and checked the sunroom\u2019s and great room\u2019s back doors.</p><p>\u201cI guess I should put the food away,\u201d Lelandi said, her voice small and disconcerted.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cEat. You\u2019re not feeding just one now. And, Carol, you\u2019ve been on your feet all day. Go ahead and eat.\u201d</p><p>Jake returned to the dining room. \u201cRyan\u2019s right. Everything\u2019s locked up. Lelandi\u2019s made a delightful meal. I, for one, am not letting it go to waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral in their red pack have to be sick,\u201d Carol said softly.</p><p>\u201cThen they can damn well come here for treatment. Not take off with you like a bunch of thieves in the night,\u201d Ryan growled.</p><p>Lelandi gave him a small smile and ate more of her potatoes. Then she attempted to change the volatile subject. \u201cSo, Ryan, do you have any brothers or sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sister. She lives with me. Owns a successful nursery that keeps her out of trouble most of the time.\u201d And he hoped to hell she was staying out of trouble while he was away.</p><p>\u201cIs she unmated?\u201d Lelandi asked, her brows elevating with intrigue.</p><p>\u201cCantankerous.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s gaze settled on Jake.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cYour psychology courses don\u2019t include Matchmaking 101, do they?\u201d</p><p>This time she smiled broadly and again turned her attention to Ryan. \u201cHow do you feel about cats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCats?\u201d He was a dog kind of guy. Cats were too independent to his way of thinking. Dogs knew he was the alpha in the situation whenever he\u2019d encountered them. Cats? Hell. The cats thought they ruled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, fuzzy little felines,\u201d Lelandi continued, as if he didn\u2019t know what they were.</p><p>\u201cMost of us don\u2019t have pets.\u201d Which was the truth. Ryan could just imagine what would happen if he had a Tweety bird and then turned into a wolf. On the other hand, even wild animals that were normally predator and prey could be raised together and become best of friends. Still, he didn\u2019t even see himself as a dog owner\u2014and certainly not a cat owner.</p><p>But the mischievous look on Lelandi\u2019s face said she had some reason for bringing the subject up. Carol didn\u2019t show any expression one way or another, so he couldn\u2019t tell if she liked pets or not.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>Lelandi forked up some more brisket. \u201cJust wondered.\u201d</p><p>Ryan glanced at Carol. She quickly focused on her meal.</p><p>Hell, Carol must have a cat. Jake was right. Whenever Lelandi had an opportunity to play matchmaker, she worked hard at it.</p><p>\u201cI have a cat.\u201d Carol finally said, and waited for him to show his distaste for the idea. Instead he just grunted. She shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s good-natured, loving, and won\u2019t catch mice, although he loves to tackle my feet when I\u2019m wearing a long robe or play with my shoelaces.\u201d</p><p>The long robe made him think of Carol in nothing but satiny skin underneath. \u201cBut when you shift? Then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuss loves dogs. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll love me just the same.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi cleared her throat and directed her comment to Carol. \u201cRose took him over to her flower shop for the day to show him off, if that\u2019s all right with you. She\u2019s been missing her own cat since he died a few weeks ago. I tried calling you to ask if it was okay, but you must have been with a patient. She thought he wouldn\u2019t be so lonely when you\u2019re working your nursing shifts.\u201d</p><p>Carol smiled. \u201cHe loves people, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll enjoy visiting with her and her customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll drop him by after the shop closes in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s cell phone rang. \u201cYeah, Darien?\u201d Jake was on edge, which showed in both his voice and the way his body tensed. He frowned and looked at Carol.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Everything\u2019s fine here. See you in a little while.\u201d He hung up his phone. \u201cThe sheriff and Deputy Trevor were knocked out. Nurse Matthew is looking after them. Tom fought off North and a couple of men until they retreated. Matthew is looking after our injured men. Doc\u2019s still at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his wolf form,\u201d Carol whispered, hating that what she thought would come to pass had. She was certain he would still be in his wolf form.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but not to worry,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Carol frowned. \u201cAs a wolf, he couldn\u2019t tell anyone what had happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarien said he smelled that North and the others had been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Doc change back, Jake? Why wouldn\u2019t he talk to Darien?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll change when he feels the urge.\u201d But this time Jake didn\u2019t look so sure of that, and Lelandi\u2019s face paled.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they take Doc with him? Was it because he couldn\u2019t help them? That he couldn\u2019t change into his human form? Call Darien back. Tell him to order Doc to change back. He has to comply with Darien\u2019s wishes, right?\u201d Carol said.</p><p>Jake let out his breath in a huff. \u201cAll right, all right.\u201d He punched a number and said, \u201cHey, Darien, Carol wants you to order Doc to shift back to his human form.\u201d His brows pinched into a dark frown. \u201cAnd?\u201d He looked at Carol and shook his head slowly.</p><p>\u201cHave him brought here so we can watch him. And Puss\u2019s favorite bed is still at Doc Mitchell\u2019s vet clinic. Can he have someone run by there and get it for him?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>Jake passed on the information. \u201cAnything else, Carol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you or Darien shape-shift again until we can figure out what happened to Doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarien, Tom, and I aren\u2019t royals. We have to change sometime during the phases of the moon, except for the new moon. We don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry not to,\u201d she reiterated. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Jake passed the information along to Darien and then signed off and stared at the uneaten portion of his meal. \u201cWhat happens that makes you think I can\u2019t change back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the vision, you\u2019re agitated, and Lelandi says Darien can\u2019t change back. It\u2019s not a nightmare. It\u2019s a vision.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHell, Carol, you didn\u2019t say that Lelandi said so. That makes a world of difference,\u201d Jake scolded her. \u201cI mean, with the other version, I just figured you couldn\u2019t see that I\u2019d changed back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I told Lelandi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Carol. I just couldn\u2019t believe it myself.\u201d Lelandi rubbed her arms covered with goose bumps.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s causing the trouble?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, if Doc doesn\u2019t change back, maybe it has to do with the cold he got. Or flu virus.\u201d Carol chewed on her lip. \u201cSince he\u2019s a wolf now, he\u2019ll have all wolf genetics. Have Darien call Doc Mitchell and run some tests on Doc Weber\u2019s blood. See if he can discover if he\u2019s still sick. If he isn\u2019t, the change probably knocked out the illness like you said it might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d Jake asked. \u201cI doubt Doc Weber will appreciate it if the vet starts testing his blood without his permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only correlation I can see for now. Besides, if there isn\u2019t a problem, Doc Weber can shift and tell the vet where to go. If there is a problem, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be grateful we\u2019re trying to learn the cause and do something about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Jake flipped his phone back open and called Darien. \u201cCarol needs one more thing done.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 21</p><p>HELL, EVERYTHING IS GOING FURTHER DOWNHILL, Ryan thought when Darien called an hour after dinner with news from the vet clinic. Doc Mitchell was missing.</p><p>\u201cI have to return to the hospital and take blood samples from Doc Weber,\u201d Carol said, sitting at the dining table and looking ready to leap from her seat and do something, anything.</p><p>\u201cNot without Darien\u2019s approval.\u201d Jake stared out the window. \u201cAnd besides, Matthew said he\u2019d do it. We\u2019ve got men looking for the vet. Some others are watching Doc Weber in case anyone tries to take him, and some who are watching Nurse Matthew and Nurse Charlotte. Seven men are here guarding the house from the outside, and others searching for North and his men. For now, Darien doesn\u2019t want anyone to move from his assigned job. Not until he knows what we\u2019re up against.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi, who had been on the go every minute the last time Ryan was here, looked tired again, slumped in her chair and quiet, with her eyes half closed. And as restless as Carol had been throughout the night, she looked exhausted. If she had to go back to the hospital in an hour or so, she needed some rest.</p><p>\u201cThe ladies look like they need to lie down for a while,\u201d Ryan said to Jake.</p> <p>He frowned at Ryan, looked at Lelandi, and then switched his attention to Carol. \u201cAll right. Come on. I\u2019ll watch Lelandi and you guard Carol while they get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Ryan and Carol walked up the stairs, following Jake and Lelandi. This time, Ryan intended to sit in the recliner and watch over Carol like a dutiful bodyguard.</p><p>Both women were moving so slowly that he wanted to carry Carol and tell Jake to do the same with Lelandi. But he assumed Jake didn\u2019t want to push his luck by overstepping his boundaries with Darien\u2019s mate unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>Ryan wrapped his arm around Carol\u2019s waist and helped her up the stairs. She slumped against him, cuddling with him. Instantly the notion of sitting in the recliner seemed not as likely.</p><p>As Jake passed Carol\u2019s bedroom door, he gave Ryan a stern look that warned him to behave himself with Carol. Ryan told himself that he would behave himself as long as that\u2019s what Carol wanted. He wasn\u2019t so sure she wanted him to control his sexual urges with regard to her, not after the way she\u2019d kissed him back at the clinic. Maybe it was damned wishful thinking on his part.</p><p>He followed her into the bedroom and closed the door as she sat on the bed and then pulled off her tennis shoes. He walked over to the recliner and sat, hoping for an invitation to lie down with her. Dog tired, he hadn\u2019t gotten much sleep the previous night, either. But she needed to sleep more than he did if her medical services might be required later that night. Unless she needed his comfort if she experienced any more night terrors, she was probably just as well off sleeping alone. Maybe even better off. Although he hated to admit it.</p><p>For a moment, Carol sat on the bed, staring at the floor and not saying a word.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Another vision?\u201d Ryan was ready to leave the chair and sit next to her, to coax the truth from her, if need be.</p> <p>She shook her head and took a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you deal with one of your cases, I\u2019m sure. Just trying to sort out what\u2019s going on.\u201d She pulled her scrub\u2019s shirt over her head, exposing a silky sheer bra. Her darkened dusty-pink nipples pressed against the fabric like two perfect jewels. Did she even realize how sexy she looked?</p><p>\u201cYour sister said you talked about me to her.\u201d Carol stood, grabbed her waistband, and pulled her scrub pants down her hips. She let the pants slide to her feet and then stepped out of them.</p><p>His gaze latched onto the thatch of golden curls showing through the silk bikini panties.</p><p>\u201cRyan?\u201d</p><p>His gaze lifted to see her brows raised. She pulled the eyelet cover aside, climbed under it, and then situated the top of it under her chin.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to your sister about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say to her?\u201d His mind was in a fog. His thoughts were still centered on the way Carol looked in her sheer underwear\u2014sexy, tantalizing, and inviting more than just his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYes. She said you kept talking about me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cShe called you?\u201d The notion finally sank into his lust-filled brain. He didn\u2019t recall the conversations he\u2019d had with Rosalind about Carol during the investigation. He supposed he\u2019d said he thought Carol\u2019s psychic abilities weren\u2019t for real.</p><p>\u201cNot sure. Most likely about what you\u2019d envisioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019d lied then?\u201d She didn\u2019t sound angry, just sleepy and inquisitive.</p><p>\u201cNot lied. Just overheard conversations and incorporated them into dreams and thought you\u2019d had a vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe Rosalind would bring it up. If she wanted Carol to like him, why cause a rift between them? \u201cI honestly don\u2019t recall anything else I discussed with her. Except maybe about another case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to ask her then.\u201d</p><p>He ground his teeth, not liking that Rosalind intended to stir things up. Even though he\u2019d planned on remaining on the chair and only joining Carol if night terrors revisited her, he changed his mind and began unbuttoning his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhatever was said before was the past. It\u2019s not important. The future is what concerns me.\u201d</p><p>She watched him unbutton his shirt, and he swore she was undressing him with her eyes before he could even get to his pants. Which made him work faster on his belt. He divested himself of the rest of his clothes, except for his boxers, and climbed into the canopy bed. He motioned to the eyelet canopy overhead. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve entered the bedchambers of a cloistered princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, as a Highland warrior of an opposing clan? This is not exactly a Highland bed or setting.\u201d She moved closer to him and snuggled against his body, the warmth of her silky soft curves heating his blood.</p><p>He kissed the top of her head, wanting from the bottom of his heart to make her fantasies come to life. He told himself that was because of all the years of wanting and never fulfilling his own destiny. Carol, Little Miss Nightingale, and one sexy witch rolled up in one was the only woman who\u2019d ever be right for him. Not that they didn\u2019t have a lot of things to work out\u2014shape-shifting and coming to grips with her werewolf half were at the top of the list.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get my plaid out of the truck and toss it over us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019d run outside like you\u2019re dressed now? Wearing only your boxers? What would the men guarding the house think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this were my castle, they\u2019d cheer me on. At Darien\u2019s, they wouldn\u2019t like it much.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled, the sensuous sound teasing his senses. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter as long as the Highlander is part of the setting.\u201d She smiled up at him, and for a moment, he thought she didn\u2019t look all that sleepy\u2014instead, sultry and decadently wicked in her seductive lingerie.</p><p>But being honorable\u2014or as honorable as he could be when he wanted something less than honorable\u2014he said, \u201cGet some sleep in case Darien calls and wants you to return to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>With her gaze focused on Ryan\u2019s chest, she stroked his belly with the tips of her fingers, softly tantalizing and as erotically as anything he\u2019d ever experienced. Already his blood was running south, preparing him for a much more vigorous workout. He wanted to move her onto her back, take her as her mate would, and claim her for his own, but he assumed she wasn\u2019t ready for that.</p><p>He cleared his throat and ran his hand through her hair, luxuriating in the silky golden strands. He hated to ask, hated to ruin the moment, but he had to know how far she was willing to take this before he did something she wasn\u2019t prepared for.</p><p>Before he could question how far she wanted to go, she murmured, \u201cHmm,\u201d and slid her fingers lower, past his navel, lower still until she slipped them underneath his waistband and gingerly caressed the skin beneath the elastic.</p><p>He sucked in a breath, waiting for her to move her fingers even lower, where his erection had curled upward begging for her touch.</p><p>Then a horrible thought occurred to him. They didn\u2019t have much time. What if Darien called and wanted Carol to go to the hospital pronto? Yet Ryan couldn\u2019t move, the anticipation of her touch suspending him in time.</p><p>Her fingers surged deeper into his briefs, sweeping across the tip of his penis, which jumped at her touch.</p><p>He still wanted to know how far she was willing to go. Oh, hell. Forget words. He couldn\u2019t come up with the right ones. And he assumed she wanted what he did at this point anyway. He rolled her over on her back and straddled her leg so he could slide his fingers under her waistband. He didn\u2019t take as long to find her sweets, slipping his fingers through her curly hairs and then lower until he found her warm wetness and began to stroke the jewel that made her arch slightly against his fingers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He knew then that she had to be his. Or he would never have taken it this far with one of his own kind. But he also knew he had to take this slowly until she was ready to accept him all the way. After all, she was newly turned and probably still didn\u2019t completely understand what taking a mate meant.</p><p>She barely breathed, her fingers touching his chest but not moving, just frozen in place as she concentrated on how he stroked her hard little nub, her body undulating with fever. He leaned down to kiss her gently, to savor the wine on her lips. To his surprise and delight, she devoured him as if she\u2019d been starved for affection forever, her lips caressing his, her tongue darting around his mouth, tasting, memorizing, and tangling with his.</p><p>She drugged him with her sensuous urgency. She might not have been born a lupus garou, but she knew how to stir up the wolf in him. He plunged his tongue into her open mouth, and she sucked on it, her fingers groping for his erection. He almost forgot what he was doing, considering the way she fueled a fire deep inside him, until she gave a soft moan and writhed under his fingertips. He stroked her willing, hot little nub, as her fingers dug into his arms, her eyes closed, her lips parted. A soft moan escaped, and her body trembled with orgasm. He smiled, loving how willingly she\u2019d responded to his touch.</p> <p>But no sooner had he had those thoughts than she worked his erection, coaxing and stroking up and down with the right firmness. He couldn\u2019t last. Before he could begin to draw the sensation out, he felt as though he were freefalling from an airplane without a parachute\u2014 free, on top of the world. Her hand on him kept up the pressure until he came. He groaned her name, wishing that he could have been inside of her as she milked him, with her eyes half lidded and her tongue sweeping over her well-kissed lips.</p><p>He pressed his mouth against hers again, savoring the softness, the sweetness, moving down to her throat and then to her silky sheer bra. Pushing her bra down with frantic urgency until he exposed a breast, he sucked on one of her firm, eager nipples that was greedy for his touch.</p><p>\u201cDid you envision this?\u201d he asked, his voice still husky with need, his hands cupping her other breast, fondling, and drawing his thumb over the nipple still confined in silk and loving the different textures.</p><p>She gave him a tender smile and swept her hands over his bare shoulders. \u201cEnvision, yes, when I saw you shift and standing as such a healthy specimen of a man in the woods nearby. And again, when I imagined you wearing your plaid. But a premonition of the actual act? No. If I had, Ryan McKinley, I probably wouldn\u2019t have told you. Some things are just not meant to be said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet we agreed you would tell me everything you perceived. Everything.\u201d He smiled at her, and removed her bra and panties and his boxers. Then he drew her out of the bed, swept her up in his arms, and carried her to the bathroom.</p> <p>\u201cLelandi will hear the shower running and suspect something isn\u2019t quite right,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe already knows I\u2019ve claimed you for my mate.\u201d</p><p>She raised a brow as Ryan set her on the bathroom floor. \u201cI didn\u2019t think werewolves were considered mated unless they truly consummated the relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not mine,\u201d he said, not caring how possessive he sounded as he turned on the shower. \u201cIt just means we only have one more hurdle to cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurdle.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her and set her in the tub under the pulsating showerhead. \u201cYeah, hurdle. You\u2019re no longer available, even if we haven\u2019t consummated the relationship. Once that\u2019s done, we\u2019ve overcome the last barrier.\u201d He smiled down at her as she rolled her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cDarien or the others won\u2019t go along with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and the others will know better than to challenge me in this. I know this isn\u2019t the time, but on a lighter subject, we have another difficulty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake\u2019s ready to have a showdown with me.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat are the two of you in disagreement over now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys are funny... you know that? He\u2019s never shown any real interest in me. You\u2019re the one who came sneaking around Darien\u2019s house in the middle of the night, hoping to catch a glimpse of me. Only my hair wasn\u2019t long enough to let down out of the window to give you a way up to rescue me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRescue you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom Darien\u2019s ruling that I have to have a mate\u2014soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d known how you felt, I would have brought a ladder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d she said, reaching out to grab his hand and pulling him into the shower with her, her heated gaze raking over him in a seductive pass, \u201c... you would have been naked.\u201d</p><p>His hands molded to her shoulders, and he caressed them with his thumb, remembering how she\u2019d taunted him with her scandalous nightgown. He reached down and softly pulled on one of her erect nipples. \u201cWhy did you go to the window in such a see-through gown? Hell, what if I\u2019d been bad news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan McKinley, you are bad news.\u201d</p><p>He slyly smiled, and she slid her arms around his neck and leaned into his body, rubbing a little to stir him up. And hell, it did. She was arousing him with the way she touched him, pressing, demanding more.</p><p>The hot water ran over her shoulders in a silky stream and slipped down between their chests. She raised her chin and offered her tantalizing mouth. Despite not wanting to appear overzealous, he couldn\u2019t help the way he wanted her. Again.</p><p>Quickly succumbing to her seduction, he realized he hadn\u2019t the strength to show restraint and kissed her hard with uncontrolled yearning, his tongue deeply penetrating her mouth, tasting her, wanting her. As if of their own volition, his hands slid down her back, with the water sluicing over her skin, and firmly cupped her buttocks.</p><p>She moaned and tightened her hold around his neck, leaning against him further. Then she sighed and released him. He thought she meant to stop him in his quest for fulfillment, dashing his hopes, and for a second, he was annoyed with himself for pushing her so fast. But she separated from him only enough to squeeze some soap out of her lavender body-wash container. Then her fingers were all over him again as she ran the pearly substance over his chest, the sensuous touch making him groan with want.</p><p>Making a special stop, first on one nipple and then the other, she teased just around the edges and then rubbed the tip with a soft thumb. She was killing him softly, came to mind as his hands returned to her tantalizing behind.</p><p>He desired her more than he\u2019d ever wanted anyone in his life. And he was so close to having her for good. But patience, he reminded himself. For her sake, he had to let her get used to the idea.</p><p>Shifting his hands to her wet hair, he gently combed his fingers through the silky strands, mesmerized with the feel of her slippery body pressed against his, and the way she licked her lips and watched him with eyes filled with desire.</p><p>She broke the spell by running soap down his penis, which reacted instantly and eagerly to her touch. He captured her mouth in a hungry kiss with no holds barred, urgent, passionate, needy. God, he was needy. Forget having the strength to let her get used to the notion of being his mate. He wanted her now, fully and forever.</p><p>He slid his fingers between her legs and began stroking where he found her wet from her own needs and from the shower. She moaned with pleasure and clenched her hands around his waist, demanding that he finish what he\u2019d started. But he wanted to finish so much more than what he\u2019d begun.</p><p>He stroked her sex, and his touch took her by a storm, judging from the way her knees weakened and how tightly she clutched at him.</p><p>He wanted to trap her against the tile shower wall and claim her, but he continued to stroke her, watching her eyes close as she clung fiercely to him, her breath shallow, her heart beating fast and furious. Arching against his questing fingers, she let out a little cry, right before he captured her mouth to silence her sounds of exultation. She trembled and sagged against him as the orgasm rippled through her, looking as though she wasn\u2019t up for much more.</p><p>But her lips curved up in a wicked little grin as her eyes opened, her gaze capturing his. She huskily whispered, \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>Only this time, he wanted her snug little feminine chamber holding him tight. Then again, her hand on his erection\u2014sliding, touching, and tightening\u2014held him hostage, a very willing hostage, and he was grateful to have this intimacy between them any way he could. His hands were on her hips now, his cheek against hers, his body soaring with her strokes.</p><p>Carol felt drained and, at the same time, as if she\u2019d soared on an eagle\u2019s wings across the world and back. She wanted to collapse in bed with Ryan and sleep the rest of the day, tight in his embrace. She loved to see his reaction when she stroked his needs, just as she could see how much pleasure he got from seeing how much she loved his touch. She knew he wanted to be inside her. She wasn\u2019t ready. Or at least she wouldn\u2019t admit to herself that she was. Not yet.</p><p>This touching\u2014the sexual play between them, intimate and satisfying\u2014was enough for her now. She hoped he would understand. Although from the way his heart was pounding and his hands were gripping her hips harder, he was having a difficult time holding on. He seemed all right about wanting just this for now.</p><p>She had claimed him, held power over him, and seen his eyes swimming with lust. He was beautiful and sexy. Hard all over, but tender of heart. She loved that he was a wolf and a man, all wrapped up in one.</p><p>Her hand squeezed his arousal just a little more as she stroked him, and he groaned and even appeared a bit weak-kneed. Then he came with a more soulful groan, which she hurriedly tried to silence with a deep kiss. He responded desperately to her kiss with the same passionate tongue strokes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me, Carol,\u201d he whispered against her ear as he hugged her tight against his chest.</p><p>If the water hadn\u2019t begun to cool and she hadn\u2019t shivered, she was sure he would have held her there longer in his hard embrace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one for you. All your patients say so. The bachelor males in the pack already know so. Tom\u2019s out of the picture since he\u2019s looking for a dream mate. And Jake\u2019s too late. Even my sister informed me you would be perfect for me, nice and pliable,\u201d Ryan said in a hushed voice, as if making a last-ditch effort to ensure she knew he wasn\u2019t giving her up to anyone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carol\u2019s brows arched at the reference to her being pliable.</p><p>\u201cI told Rosalind you weren\u2019t the least bit biddable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I have to say about this? Anything?\u201d Carol pinched his nipples lightly.</p> <p>\u201cJust agree.\u201d He quickly rinsed them both off before the water could turn from cool to cold. \u201cYou need to learn our ways,\u201d he added, whispering against her ear.</p><p>She backed away, but he stopped her with his hand on her wrist before she could leave the tub.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely no way am I shifting. Not in light of what\u2019s going on. And besides, I won\u2019t take a mate just because...\u201d Her eyes narrowed, and she stiffened. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s okay to mate with me now that you believe I\u2019m psychic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the reason at all. But you\u2019re going to be my mate.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, which made him frown.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he said, feigning bruised pride.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course you are. I\u2019ve told you all along that you want me. But more is at stake here than your needs.\u201d She left the tub and grabbed a towel.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d finished rinsing off and towel dried, she had dressed and left the bedroom. Hell, he knew that this business of shifting would be a sticking point with her, but he hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d muddle it up so quickly.</p><p>When Carol reached the bar in the den in search of a good stiff drink, she found Jake drinking hot cocoa as he leaned back on a recliner and watched her. She frowned at him, whipped around, and headed for the kitchen, the cocoa sounding a lot better on this chilly night. Besides, chocolate always did her a world of good.</p><p>\u201cProblems?\u201d Jake asked, following her into the kitchen.</p><p>She really didn\u2019t need Jake pestering her right now.</p> <p>Jake took a sip of his cocoa and then set the mug down and pulled one out of the cupboard for her. \u201cWhat did he say or do to upset you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour face is flushed. You\u2019re breathing hard. If you were a wolf...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, damn it.\u201d She stared at the counter, her eyes blurring with tears. She brushed away a couple that dared to slide down her cheeks.</p><p>Looking uncomfortable, Jake didn\u2019t say anything further. He just poured her a mug of hot chocolate. She heard Ryan coming before he entered the kitchen and wished they\u2019d both leave her alone.</p><p>When Ryan walked inside, he didn\u2019t speak to either of them, but she knew they were exchanging knowing looks. Two men, both born lupus garous, both on the same side of the issue. She wouldn\u2019t gain anyone\u2019s sympathy here. She muttered a thank-you to Jake for the hot chocolate and then escaped to the solitude of the sunroom, hoping that neither of them would follow her.</p><p>The room was cold: the fire was untended, and the massive windows let in the chilly air now that the sun had disappeared for the night.</p><p>She sat on one of the sofas and threw a wool afghan over her lap and took a long sip of the hot chocolate, wishing she and Ryan were just two ordinary people who had found each other and fallen in love. Everything was so complicated with them being werewolves. Did Ryan think he could order her around because he had been born a werewolf? Because he would be her mate? She was not shape-shifting!</p> <p>She gazed out the window at the darkness and saw Mervin staring off into the woods. Serving as one of their guards, no doubt. She sighed. No matter how much she wanted to avoid her wolf side, she also wanted Ryan. Unfortunately, having one meant having the other.</p><p>The room was so cold that she slipped off her shoes and tucked her feet underneath her on the velour sofa. But she still shivered as she looked out the window where she observed the growing moon, beautiful and white like a huge, exquisite pearl against the black velvet night.</p><p>She drank more of her chocolate, trying to shake the chill. The heat from the chocolate and the blanket were beginning to warm her. Warm her... no. The moon. She gritted her teeth, feeling the urge to shift, the craving to ditch her clothes, and tried to summon a vision. But nothing came to her.</p><p>She hurriedly set the mug on the coffee table and jerked the afghan aside. Her movement caught Mervin\u2019s eye, and he smiled at her and waved.</p><p>No, no, no! She jerked off her scrubs shirt, exposing her bra-clad breasts, and felt the heat deepening as it worked its way through her bloodstream.</p><p>See something, Carol. Envision something. Make it stop!</p><p>Mervin watched her from his distant post, his mouth agape. She couldn\u2019t leave now, couldn\u2019t head for her bedroom, or Ryan and Jake would catch her in her current state of alarm as she made her way through the great room to the stairs. And follow her. Probably try to make her accept what she couldn\u2019t accept.</p><p>She jerked off her socks and yanked down her scrubs pants. Oh, God, no. She couldn\u2019t do it. The heat invaded her bones, and her skin perspired lightly. She was going to shift.</p><p>Jake didn\u2019t say anything as Ryan fixed himself a cup of coffee, but Ryan knew he wanted to hear what had upset Carol. He\u2019d probably figured out what it was all about anyway. Ryan didn\u2019t owe Jake an explanation, but he offered it anyway.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat goes without saying.\u201d Jake poured himself another cup of hot chocolate.</p><p>Ryan looked in the direction of the entryway to the kitchen. \u201cI upset her when I told her she needed to learn our ways.\u201d</p><p>Jake gave a conceited smile. \u201cFigured that was what was bothering her. I could have told you that Darien and I have gone round and round with her over it. Tom is more subtle about it. Lelandi\u2019s tried in a sisterly way.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cHer mate will have to take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi smiled as she walked into the kitchen, looking much revived.</p><p>\u201cHmm, the aroma of hot cocoa. You knew what would stir me from a nice spring nap, didn\u2019t you, Jake? So whose mate will have to take care of what?\u201d She pulled out a mug from the cupboard, and Jake poured her a cup of chocolate.</p><p>Neither Ryan nor Jake said, but they shared looks with each other.</p><p>\u201cOh, Carol,\u201d Lelandi whispered and then frowned. \u201cDid you... you know, finalize things?\u201d</p><p>Ryan shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t mated. But he\u2019s declared she\u2019s his,\u201d Jake said with a smile. \u201cBetter let Silva know so she can spread the word via the grapevine. But there are problems in paradise already. She doesn\u2019t like him telling her she\u2019s got to learn our ways any more than she likes us telling her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Carol now?\u201d Lelandi asked, her voice low.</p><p>\u201cSunroom,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI was giving her a minute to be by herself. I\u2019ll see to her.\u201d</p><p>The door to the sunroom slammed open, and Ryan said, \u201cShit. She couldn\u2019t have run off by herself. What the hell is she thinking?\u201d He tore off for the sunroom with Jake and Lelandi on his heels.</p><p>But when they reached the sunroom, Mervin raced inside to meet them. \u201cShe, Carol... hell, she...\u201d He motioned to her clothes piled up on the sunroom floor next to the couch.</p><p>\u201cShifted?\u201d Ryan couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cYeah and went out the electric wolf door. I don\u2019t have permission to leave my guard post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s one of the ones we\u2019re guarding!\u201d Ryan squelched the urge to call Mervin an idiot. Instead, he began ripping off his clothes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Darien,\u201d Lelandi said. \u201cJake, you go with Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to stay and protect you. I\u2019ll call in more help.\u201d</p><p>Ryan didn\u2019t wait to hear what else Jake decided. Instead, Ryan shifted and raced out the door. Mervin ran outside after him and pointed in the direction she had run. But Ryan could smell her just fine and took off after the footpad scent she was leaving behind.</p><p>He hoped the hell North and his men were nowhere about and that Carol wasn\u2019t too traumatized by what she was experiencing. He had no idea how she might cope with this aspect of her life, but he wished she\u2019d let him be a part of it.</p><p>He\u2019d run for about a mile when he heard the sound of gunfire. Hell. And then more. A wolf yelped in the distance. Then another.</p><p>He paused. Carol\u2019s scent headed in a different direction from the sounds of the injured wolves. Ryan lifted his head and howled. He was met with silence. He howled again, long and deep and low.</p><p>Except for the rustle of the breeze stirring the tree branches, nothing.</p><p>He took off after Carol\u2019s trail again. He had to find her and then locate the other wolves. Just as he ran down toward the river, he saw her, a beautiful red wolf snarling, her nose wrinkled, teeth bared, ears and tail held high, as she stood backed up against the water\u2019s edge, while three men taunted her with a fishing net.</p><p>It was North and two of his men, one of whom had grazed Ryan with a bullet.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>THEIR BACKS TO RYAN, NORTH AND HIS MEN READIED a fishing net that was aimed at Carol. Her wolf posture indicated she was ready to bolt, and the men\u2019s bodies steeled with tension as they shouted to one another, \u201cDon\u2019t miss her this time, damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I\u2019m not a fisherman, North!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d another man said. \u201cIf we fish, it\u2019s with our teeth!\u201d</p><p>Her red fur bristling and fluffed out to the max, Carol appeared larger and more threatening, yet she had the sense to skitter out of the way of the net. But she wouldn\u2019t go into the water where she could have easily escaped capture. Seeing this, the men kept her corralled with her back against the stream. As soon as the net landed on the ground, missing her, the men scurried to retrieve it, while watching her to make sure she didn\u2019t attack. Why didn\u2019t she just jump into the water and swim away?</p><p>At least none of them seemed inclined to shoot her.</p><p>Ryan kept running toward them. Concentrating hard on Carol, not one of the men realized the threat swiftly approaching at their backs. Ryan could have growled to warn them before he attacked. But he was worried that they might have guns and shoot him, and then he couldn\u2019t protect Carol. He targeted the man in charge, North. Even now, Ryan could see red, remembering how the bastard had left Carol wet and naked, shivering on the frosty grass near Darien\u2019s house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carol glanced over at Ryan, her eyes widening, her ears flattening a little, her snarl vanishing. The men turned around to see what had caught her attention.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d one of the men said, dropping the net and running for dear life.</p><p>North and the other man ran in a different direction. His wolf urges dictating his actions, Ryan fought the craving to chase any of them down and end their sorry lives, which would mean leaving Carol alone. He couldn\u2019t abandon her. Not with the possibility that the person shooting wolves might come upon her. Or that North or his other men might come back for her.</p> <p>But mostly, he wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d react now that she was wearing her wolf coat, and he had to be here for her more than ever.</p><p>Her ears perked up again, and she studied him. He loped toward her, hoping she wouldn\u2019t run off. He had no idea if she could understand their ways in wolf form. Not unless she\u2019d grown up and learned their nuances. He grew close. Still, she didn\u2019t take flight. He stepped nearer, nudged the side of her muzzle with his nose, and then licked her face. Come home, he wanted to say to her. Come with me. But she seemed frozen in place.</p><p>He heard a couple of people running toward them and looked back over his shoulder. Christian and Jake, neither of whom had shape-shifted.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d Jake said to Carol. \u201cWe\u2019re glad you shifted, Carol, but you need to return to the house now! Lelandi\u2019s going to have those babies early if she gets any more upset about this.\u201d</p><p>Carol looked toward the house and then filled her lungs with air. Making up her mind, she loped toward the house, to Ryan\u2019s relief. He joined her and ran alongside her, his body lightly touching hers, trying to console her if she needed his support. He was sure she needed someone\u2019s.</p> <p>Jake and Christian ran behind them, but at a human\u2019s speed, they\u2019d never catch up. Jake was talking on his phone, giving Darien an update on Carol and the wolf shootings.</p><p>\u201cAll right, we\u2019ll hang tight until we get word from you. Yeah, she\u2019ll be all right. You know Carol. She always perseveres.\u201d</p><p>Ryan was glad to hear the admiration in Jake\u2019s voice instead of condemnation. Carol needed encouragement more than anything else, and he planned to be her uncritically enthusiastic supporter helping her through the changes in her life.</p><p>When Ryan and Carol reached the house, Mervin was inside with Avery and Lelandi.</p><p>\u201cThank God, you\u2019re all right,\u201d Lelandi said to Carol. \u201cWe heard shooting.\u201d She rubbed her stomach in a worried way. \u201cI put your clothes in your room.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cAnd yours also, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>He would have smiled at Lelandi\u2019s thoughtfulness, except for the seriousness of the situation. Instead, he followed Carol out of the sunroom, through the great room, and then up the stairs to her bedroom. He didn\u2019t even give a thought to the possibility that he might not be able to shift back, or that she couldn\u2019t. But when they reached her bedroom and he shifted, she didn\u2019t. He closed the door and dressed while she paced like a caged beast.</p> <p>Shifting was so natural to someone born a werewolf that he didn\u2019t know how to explain what she should do. He thought the process would be innate, but apparently not. Or...</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about the doc. She couldn\u2019t be stuck in her wolf form!</p><p>He walked over and touched her neck. She stopped and waited. He wrapped his arms around her neck and hugged her, leaning his face against hers.</p><p>\u201cYou can shift back, Carol. Just will it. You\u2019re so distraught that you\u2019re not thinking clearly.\u201d At least that\u2019s what he hoped the matter was.</p><p>For at least another ten minutes, which seemed an eternity, she stood there and breathed in hard breaths, her eyes gazing at him briefly. Then she focused on the dresser. It felt like she would stand there for the rest of eternity, just staring at the furniture, unable to do anything else.</p><p>\u201cYou can do it,\u201d he encouraged and rubbed her head between her ears. Then he ran his hand over her back, attempting to console her. If she hadn\u2019t liked it, she would have growled or moved away, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>Still, when he stopped petting her to see what would happen, she didn\u2019t nudge his hand to encourage him to continue. And then she began to pace again.</p><p>Hell. \u201cCarol, you can do it. You can shift back. Close your eyes and see the change. Feel the heat, the swift transformation. Feel it.\u201d</p> <p>She suddenly ran into the bathroom and pushed the door closed with her nose.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want him to see her shifting? \u201cCarol, shifting is a natural occurrence for us. It\u2019s a beautiful process, something to be cherished.\u201d</p><p>Minutes later, she jerked the door open and scowled at him, naked and beautiful, her expression heated as she stalked toward her clothes laid out on the bed.</p><p>\u201cFor you, maybe, damn it, but not for me.\u201d</p><p>He grasped her wrist to stop her from avoiding him and folded his arms around her silky body, holding her tight. Her armor instantly slipped.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was lost to the wolf,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>He swallowed hard, kissed her on the top of her head, and held her close until the sobs died down. \u201cYou\u2019re all right, honey. You\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never be fine again,\u201d she said through the tears.</p><p>\u201cYou will. Together, we\u2019ll do this. I\u2019ll always be there for you.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, her eyes shimmering with unspent tears. \u201cYou want me? Even as much of a mess as I am? You\u2019re a pack leader. You need a mate who can help you lead. Not someone who is totally clueless and doesn\u2019t even know how to howl or shift back. Or control when she\u2019s going to shift in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, Carol. What brought about the shift this time? Mervin came running to tell us you\u2019d taken off. Did he accost you again?\u201d Ryan tried to control the growl in his voice, but if Mervin had grabbed her again...</p><p>She quickly shook her head. \u201cI was just sitting in the cold sunroom, trying to get warm while I drank the hot cocoa. I saw Mervin guarding the place and then glanced up at the growing moon. The damnable moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe moon has something to do with the change as it continues to wax. But the cold can, too. If we\u2019re in a really cold environment, we can shift into our wolf half so we can be warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you do it when you choose to. Not when the wolf chooses to.\u201d She sighed deeply. \u201cRyan, I couldn\u2019t fight them. North and the others. The natural ability to defend myself came into play, the growling and snarling, the baring of teeth, but I couldn\u2019t attack them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were three of them, and they had a net. If you\u2019d attempted to attack, they could have easily captured you with the net. Instinct warned you that using a defensive posture was the only way to deal with the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have killed them. Not any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf one had tried to kill you or someone else, you might have seen it differently. That\u2019s not important. What is important is that you get the shifting under control. You could have escaped by swimming across the river, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t swim.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows. \u201cSwimming is a natural ability for wolves.\u201d</p><p>She frowned up at him. \u201cYeah, well shape-shifting is supposed to be a natural ability for us, too. And so is howling. Why couldn\u2019t I howl to let you know the three men were trying to catch me in a damned fishing net?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou could have swum. Later, when things are more settled, I\u2019ll teach you how as a human. As for howling, you probably were too busy concentrating on the men and their net. If I had been in your fur coat, that\u2019s what I would have been doing.\u201d</p><p>Jake hollered up the stairs, \u201cEverything all right up there?\u201d</p><p>Ryan rubbed Carol\u2019s bare arms and kissed her cheek. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and pulled away from him to dress.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be down in a minute. Everything\u2019s fine up here.\u201d But Ryan had a new worry, and he was certain that was some of what was still bothering Carol. When would she next shift? And why hadn\u2019t she been able to conjure up any visions this time to block the need to shift?</p><p>Not wanting to see anyone in the pack ever again because of having turned into a wolf, Carol reluctantly went downstairs with Ryan to join Jake and Lelandi. She knew Lelandi had to be worried about her. Jake, also. But she didn\u2019t want to face them. She\u2019d lost what little control she\u2019d had over her shape-shifting ability, and now Darien was sure to ban her from working at the hospital.</p><p>Jake eyed Carol with too much concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said, rubbing her arms and glowering at him. But she didn\u2019t feel okay. She felt that any little thing could trigger the shift again.</p><p>Lelandi crossed the floor, gave her a big hug, and rubbed her back. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, Carol. It\u2019s just the beginning. I swear you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s phone rang. He whipped it off his belt and said, \u201cYeah, Darien?\u201d His gaze shifted to Carol. \u201cShit. All right. I\u2019ll take her to the hospital now. What about Lelandi?\u201d He glanced in her direction. \u201cAll right, she stays here with her guard detail. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and called someone else. \u201cDeputy Trevor, three of our men have been shot\u2014in their wolf forms. Not by North\u2019s men. By human townsfolk. Get the word out pronto that anyone who shoots a wolf gets mandatory jail time. The sheriff\u2019s tracking the shooters down now, so he needs you to spread the word. I\u2019ve got to get Carol to the hospital to help with the victims. Talk later.\u201d</p><p>Jake motioned for Carol and Ryan to come with him as he called someone else.</p><p>\u201cSam, I want you to take care of the guard detail watching Lelandi. Silva can come and stay with her. I\u2019ve got to get Carol and Ryan to the hospital. Some of our men have been shot in their wolf forms, and Doc Mitchell has disappeared. Yeah, I know. Talk about a hell of a mess. We\u2019ll leave as soon as you get here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carol couldn\u2019t believe it. But then again, she\u2019d felt deep in her bones that Doc\u2019s shifting into the wolf and not being able to shift back was only the beginning of the nightmare.</p><p>Lelandi rubbed her arms as she followed them into the great room. \u201cYou can go and help our men. I\u2019ve got a guard detail already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jake and Ryan said at the same time. \u201cThey\u2019re all betas,\u201d Jake added. \u201cSam will be here as soon as he can.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could run Carol over to the hospital until Sam relieves you, Jake,\u201d Ryan offered, figuring this time they wouldn\u2019t have any trouble.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lelandi said. \u201cWhat if North and his men try to ambush you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to take care of the men who\u2019ve been injured,\u201d Carol said, her voice resolute. \u201cIt\u2019ll take Sam an hour to pick up Silva and get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>On the one hand, Ryan wanted more protection for Carol. On the other, he knew she needed to get to the men and minister to them. He pulled out a gun.</p> <p>\u201cI can manage. Besides, North and his men are probably still running through the woods.\u201d</p><p>Jake considered the gun. \u201cSilver bullets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Regular. It\u2019ll slow them down if they try to take Carol hostage again. It\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be out here watching what we are doing after the last fiasco\u2014fishing for a wolf with a net. Are you all right with this, Carol?\u201d</p><p>She was already headed for the door. He swore she would have been the first one on the scene to take care of the wounded on a battlefield, no matter what the threat to her own safety, and he couldn\u2019t help admiring her for the quality.</p><p>He strode after her, glancing over his shoulder at Jake. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know if we encounter any trouble or, if not, when we reach the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Jake gave him a stiff nod.</p> <p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Lelandi said to Carol.</p><p>\u201cYou take care of yourself,\u201d Carol said, her look worried. Then she headed out of doors.</p><p>As soon as Ryan and Carol were secure in the truck, he tore off for town. \u201cHad any more visions? Anything about your shifting or the men and the net? The men who were shot?\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the seat and ran her hand over his plaid. \u201cNo. If I\u2019d had a vision, I might have been able to stop the shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t believe it now, but the sooner you embrace our ways, the easier it will be for you to adjust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for having faith in my other abilities anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d danced any longer with me at the gathering the way that you\u2019d done, I would have believed in anything.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled and then grew serious. \u201cBelieving in my sixth sense scares you.\u201d</p> <p>He cast a wry smile at her. He didn\u2019t scare easily, but yeah, knowing a person could have glimpses of future trouble was a bit unnerving. Not only that, but the fact that she could touch an object and gain insight about it seemed too surreal to be true.</p><p>She let out her breath. \u201cI thought you ought to know that your sister called me back and talked to me further about you.\u201d</p><p>His neck muscles tensed. God only knew what Rosalind had told Carol. That he\u2019d kept a portfolio of pictures of her? That he wanted her to be his mate even before he realized that was the issue? His sister had already stirred up enough trouble.</p><p>\u201cShe said you used a fake psychic once who got you into real hot water over a case of slander. So I understand how you would feel that we\u2019re all frauds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were a fraud, exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I just make up stuff because I\u2019m such a great storyteller.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his temple, getting himself deeper into this. \u201cI had to know that you were for real, Carol. From the time we met, I\u2019ve tried to debunk your \u2018visions,\u2019 at least in my own mind. It didn\u2019t work. Either you had hearing like Silva, which you couldn\u2019t have had as a human, or you just happened to be at all the wrong places at the right time. And that was too much of a coincidence. Unless you were seeking to learn the truth about the murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you suspected I might be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re a healer. First and foremost. If you investigate anything, it\u2019s related to helping others to heal. Murder cases are not your forte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She unsnapped her seatbelt to slide across the bench seat, snapped on the belt in the middle of the seat, and snuggled up next to him.</p><p>He wrapped his arm around her and held her close as he steered the truck with one hand. \u201cAbout the night you saw some of our kind shape-shifting, I agree with you. You couldn\u2019t have witnessed such a thing in the dark. Not without our wolf\u2019s vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve never sounded like you believed me. Well, maybe an inkling. Yet you continued to question me and offer other reasons why I thought I had visions.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI was grasping at straws, and all of them vanished before I could grab hold. No, I believe you\u2019re the real deal. And I need your help.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him with a surprised expression. \u201cMy help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case I\u2019m investigating a situation and you may be able to see something I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s what this is all about. You want me to be your mate so I can solve all your cases for you.\u201d</p><p>Loving her sense of humor, he chuckled darkly. \u201cYeah, devious of me, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll help if I can. My visions aren\u2019t always predictable. I can\u2019t force...\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her, his expression warning her he knew better.</p><p>\u201c... always force them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when you\u2019re fighting the shift. And that was the other thing. You couldn\u2019t fight the shift unless you were somehow special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial,\u201d she murmured. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever called me that. Crazy, yes. Well, not so much that word exactly, but Dr. Metzger inferred it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy, eh? You\u2019re about the sanest person I know.\u201d He gave her a warm squeeze. \u201cFor five months I\u2019ve been thinking about you. Did Rosalind tell you that? That I\u2019ve been fiercely distracted? She\u2019s a gardener at heart, but she was doing some investigative work of her own, trying to discover what ailed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said you have pictures of me. Were they good shots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured she\u2019d mention them. I took photos of many of Darien\u2019s pack members.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm-hmm, and I wasn\u2019t under suspicion. Not really, according to Rosalind. So why the pictures? And why so many? Fess up, Ryan. You\u2019ve always wanted me.\u201d She rested her hand high on his thigh, the heat sizzling through his denims and arousing him instantly. \u201cBut now if you want me badly enough, you\u2019ll have to deal with Darien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you that if I\u2019d wanted you, nothing would stand in my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little psychic business.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have stopped me. See anything in regards to us being together?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>CAROL LIGHTLY RUBBED RYAN\u2019S THIGH UP AND down, nearly touching his package on the upsweep. He was ready to pull the truck over and take her for his own before they even reached the hospital, but it was too dangerous with North and his men still unaccounted for.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she murmured in a sultry way, \u201cI dreamt you came dressed in your plaid to rescue me on a white steed. It was the night North and his men took me hostage. You yanked off your plaid, wearing only your shirt and boots, and wrapped the fabric around me. Then you carried me off to the castle.\u201d</p><p>Prophetic that she should dream of him in that way? Or some deep-down Freudian desire to be with him that cast her into a fantasy world where he was her knight? He\u2019d dreamed of her, too, only she was wearing the silky translucent gown that he\u2019d seen her in when she had stood gazing out the window at him.</p><p>\u201cCastle? I was the laird, no doubt.\u201d And he would have been, had his family kept the drafty old keep. But sometime or another, they\u2019d lost it to taxes and moved to Prince Edward Island first, and then eventually to North Carolina where many Scots ended up. Werewolf or otherwise. Some of his family settled in Colorado, and there they\u2019d stayed.</p><p>\u201cAnd your clansmen were glad to see you\u2019d finally found a lady to tame your wild ways,\u201d Carol said, her hand still stroking his thigh with a light touch.</p><p>\u201cSowing my wild oats, you mean.\u201d He winked at her.</p><p>\u201cDo that often?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. She chuckled. \u201cBut I\u2019m worried about being a MacDonald. What if the McKinleys had fought the MacDonalds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the old days, who knows? Now, it doesn\u2019t matter. You know what this means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her hand paused on his thigh.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re moving the engagement date up.\u201d</p><p>She stroked his leg some more, and he gritted his teeth against the rising tide of need. \u201cIf we have time before Doc and the other men arrive...\u201d he said.</p><p>She stilled her hand on his lap. \u201cWhat about Darien?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll understand. Believe me. Know anyplace private where we can... sort things out?\u201d He didn\u2019t want to tell her that he had already made Jake aware Carol was his, that Silva would be the next to know, or that Darien already asked if he\u2019d take her as a mate.</p><p>Chuckling, she squeezed his thigh. \u201cYou get right down to business, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw me rescue you and whisk you away from the villains to the safety of yon castle, so it seems you had a premonition. Since you can\u2019t change fate, we seem destined for this. So, is there any place private where we can go?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>Smiling, she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were an adventurous sort. But more than that, I\u2019ll barely be able to move in the direction of the hospital if you keep manhandling me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAn exam table? Stirrups?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hands examination?\u201d He grinned. \u201cNow that\u2019s an idea.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe basement has a lounge area, a testing lab, a laundry room, and a snack room. Couches, clean laundry, snacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nurses\u2019 office and the doctor\u2019s office have beds for when we have to stay on-call overnight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan we lock the basement facilities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all of the rooms will lock. It just depends on what you\u2019re in the mood for. When I was in training in Denver, I once found a nurse and a doctor fooling around in a linen closet. But linen closets have never appealed to me. Unless, of course, I got locked in one with a hunk of a guy and had to while away the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith just any guy?\u201d</p><p>She patted his thigh. \u201cNot with just anyone. Twice, I\u2019ve also discovered patients having sex with lovers in their rooms. Once I\u2019d even knocked, waited for a response, and figured the patient was asleep when no one answered.\u201d</p><p>Ryan laughed. \u201cSo what did you do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTurned around and muttered something about coming back later. I was embarrassed the first time I caught a middle-aged married couple at it. By the second time, I was getting the hang of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like the patients didn\u2019t need to be in the hospital. Is an unoccupied patient\u2019s bed another choice then?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot unless I\u2019m one of the patients and feeling frisky and the visitor looked a whole lot like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019re an adventurous sport after all.\u201d But this meant a whole lot more to Ryan than the sex. Mating was the selfless commitment between a man and woman that promised a partnership through the rough times, and cherishing the good, a way to carry their genes forward through their offspring, a companion for life. No matter what, his being with her for the long term felt better than right.</p><p>He just hoped the problems she was having with transitioning could be resolved once they were mated.</p><p>When they arrived at the hospital, the place was quiet. Nurse Matthew met them in the waiting area, gave Ryan a hard look, and then said to Carol, \u201cI bandaged Tom and the others that North and his men had attacked earlier. Sam dropped by to pick up Tom and take him to Darien\u2019s house, and Silva\u2019s gone with him to stay with Lelandi. The others had someone pick them up and take them home. We\u2019ve got six guards around the outside of the hospital. The place is quiet with no overnight patients tonight.</p> <p>\u201cThe three men who were shot are being transported here. Should be another hour before they arrive, though. They have to be carried to where a vehicle can reach them and then brought here.</p><p>\u201cDoc\u2019s sleeping in his room off his office, still in his wolf form. I took blood samples, and the medical technologist has performed routine and some highly specialized tests on them. He went home for the night, if you want to take a look at the results down in the lab.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d know more about them than I would, since you were training in that area before you decided to become a nurse. With Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Webb both unable to look at them, I don\u2019t know who else to send them to. I\u2019m wiped out. Until the wounded men arrive to be patched up, I\u2019m going to lie down in one of the staff rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Matthew. I\u2019ll look at the blood samples in the basement. As soon as the wounded men arrive, I\u2019ll be back up here to help you treat them. Just let me know when they\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Matthew nodded and headed for the nurses\u2019 room.</p><p>Ryan followed Carol down the stairs to the basement, knowing he could never undo what he was about to do\u2014 and not regretting that in the least.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want to do this?\u201d he asked, just in case she wasn\u2019t ready for a full commitment. As they reached the bottom step, he opened the door for her. He had to be certain she wanted this as much as he did.</p><p>\u201cNo last-minute change of mind?\u201d He was afraid she\u2019d settle for less than a mating again. Although getting hot with her like that again was appealing, he wanted more\u2014to claim her, to make the commitment, to settle down with her.</p> <p>She gave him a quick smile. \u201cYou have to ask? You\u2019re not getting cold feet, are you? You promised to help me through what I\u2019m going through. \u2018Together,\u2019 you said.\u201d She raised a brow.</p><p>Just what he wanted to hear. He pulled her close and kissed her, ready to show her just how much he wanted her. Her fingers gripped him tight against her body, and her mouth softened against his kiss. Her body was stiff at first but then melted. His body felt tormented from her touch already, but he knew then that she wanted him just as much as he wanted her.</p><p>Her breathing shallow, she suddenly broke free from their kiss and motioned to the door. \u201cMight want to lock it.\u201d</p><p>Hating to break the spell of the raw sexual energy spiraling between them, he stalked over to the door and locked it with a click.</p><p>The water heater in the next room thrummed as warm heat filtered out of the vents above. Ryan turned off half the lights, cloaking the lounge in darkness. They could still see, but it was a lot more romantic, he thought.</p><p>She took his hand and pulled him close again. \u201cYou\u2019re a romantic at heart, Ryan McKinley. But somehow I\u2019d envisioned you being a little wilder than that.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help smiling broadly at that.</p><p>She ran her fingers over his cheek as he rested his hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t send me flowers like all the other men did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee how well it worked?\u201d he said, raising her face to his.</p><p>Her eyes were shadowed pools of blue, filled with anticipation, liquid with desire. Her lips parted, and he kissed the fullness, the softness that was all Carol, while feeling her arms go around his neck as she anchored her body against him.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he said, whispering the words against her lips, his hands shifting lower on her back, \u201cI don\u2019t follow trends.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her waistband and slid her scrub pants down her legs, bending lower to slip them off completely, and kissing her belly down to her waistband. She pressed against the heel of her tennis shoe to remove it, but he crouched to take off that one and then the other. Then he slid his hands up her bare leg, kissing her on the inside of the knee.</p><p>She shivered.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d he asked, rising, his hand sweeping up her thigh and touching her intimately between her legs. The only thing stopping him was her sheer silk panties, like a see-through chastity belt protecting the treasure. But not for long.</p><p>He slid the panties down her legs, pressing his mouth against the inside of her knees and pushing them apart to gain entrance. Then with her legs spread, he slipped his fingers into her wet hot cleft, and she immediately arched against him. Her body already screamed for release, the earlier unconsummated sex having been only the beginning.</p><p>\u201cHot,\u201d he said, describing the way she looked and felt.</p><p>\u201cExquisitely hot.\u201d She reached for his belt and struggled to unfasten it while he ran his hands up under her scrubs shirt and massaged her breasts, which were covered in the sheer silk bra without an ounce of padding. The pads of his thumbs stroked her erect nipples, and she closed her eyes, her fingers hesitating at his belt, her full lips parted in wonderment. She moaned softly and then quickly opened her eyes and jerked his belt open. After she slid his zipper down, she trailed her fingers along his rigid length, making it jump to her touch.</p><p>He pulled her scrubs top over her head, dropped it on the back of the couch, and then stared at her bra. It was better than lace or opaque material or anything else she might have worn. Her lingerie was sheer delight with her darkened nipples peaked against the fabric. He grasped her waist and licked the tantalizing peaks, first one through the silky fabric, and then the other as she speared her fingers through his hair, none too gently. Another soft moan from her lips stirred him on.</p><p>Fully aroused, he wanted her now before anything stopped him from taking her as his mate. She was playing with his buttons, so he quickly kicked off his shoes, his tongue still teasing a nipple. Then she had his shirt off and on the floor, and his trousers went the way of his shirt.</p><p>He attempted to unfasten her bra but couldn\u2019t manage, so she grabbed for the fastener while he lifted her and carried her to the couch.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be on top or underneath?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe couch is scratchy. I have very delicate skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d Ryan nuzzled her soft cheek.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019m a take-charge kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>He grinned broadly at that. She might think she was, but he had other plans.</p><p>Carol loved the way Ryan listened to her wants. With him, the ritual went so much deeper than mere sex. It was a commitment to cherish, to protect, to stand together forever\u2014and forever was a very long time, given the lifespan of a werewolf.</p><p>She was ready for the commitment, to be with the man who would risk his neck for her, who embraced her psychic quirks and patiently understood her reluctance to shift. She knew he was the one for her. She only hoped she wouldn\u2019t disappoint him as she struggled to accept the changes.</p><p>He set her next to the couch before he lay down on it. Naked, muscular, and ready, he smiled with lusty fascination. She crouched next to the sofa, brushing the light hair on his chest and moving lower, down the trail that led to his erection. The edge of her hand touched the velvet tip, already wet with anticipation and fully aroused. Now he shuddered with expectation as his erection pulsed with craving.</p><p>The smile still lit his face, although his eyes were dark with desire. She slipped her leg over his and moved until she was straddling his thigh. He placed his hands on her thighs, stroking and waiting to see what she\u2019d do next.</p><p>She felt driven to take charge of her life. To choose Ryan for her own. For once in her life, she wanted to feel in control. Maybe not of her shape-shifting problems or her psychic abilities. But right now, she was in charge of a hunky alpha male that she\u2019d be committed to for the rest of her life. And that felt good.</p><p>She moved her hand down his arousal, gliding over the stiff rod, memorizing the feel of every velvet ridge, and only stopping when his erection moved under her light touch. She reached her leg across his other one, spreading herself for him, her belly brushing gently against his heavy arousal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He moaned. \u201cCarol...\u201d She swore that if he didn\u2019t have such a husky, rushed voice, he might begin to beg. Begging was good.</p><p>Paused in a partial crouch, hovering over him with her hands planted on either side of his body against the soft couch, she held herself aloft, planning to sit and take hold of his sex and stroke until he was unable to stand the sheer pleasure another second. Until the back of his fingers swept up her inner thigh and she bit her lip, his touch sending a tremor of need through her. And then his fingers chafed against her thigh again, whisper soft, heating her core, and making her blood burn for him. His hand touched the short curly hairs at the juncture of her thighs and paused there.</p><p>She leaned against his hand, pressing her mound against his tormenting fingers. Her arms were giving out, so she decided to forgo stroking him and situated herself over his arousal to take the plunge. But she also wanted to draw out the experience, so she lowered herself against his hand again, stirring him into action. His fingers slipped into the wet folds, and she nearly died\u2014 a wonderfully exquisite death.</p><p>Every fiber of her being, wolf and human, craved having the alpha male. Nothing else mattered. She was beginning to move higher, to line herself up with his arousal, when his hands grasped her inner thighs, and she swallowed a gasp. He wasn\u2019t going to let her take control.</p><p>He pulled her closer, his thumbs directed toward her woman\u2019s core, and then reached up and began to stroke her. Her whole body felt like vanilla pudding in his hands, and she didn\u2019t think she could stay like this for very long without collapsing on him. His smile said he knew it, too. His strokes became faster, bringing her to the edge and stirring her passion until... she felt the sun and moon collide\u2014and she cried out at the first time she\u2019d ever felt so wildly intoxicated, her body still quivering with the rush of adrenaline.</p><p>Ryan should have warned her that if she thought to entice him with her feminine wiles, she\u2019d better be prepared to accept the consequences.</p><p>The smell of her sweet arousal and the way her legs straddled his, opening herself to him, were driving him mad. Holding onto his sanity, attempting control while she touched him, had to be the hardest thing he\u2019d ever done. Hell, as soon as she climbed on top of him, leaving herself ripe for penetration? He\u2019d wanted to take the plunge right then and there. He sighed. The little red wolf would be the death of him.</p><p>He released her thighs and reached up to take hold of her waist. She gasped as he lifted her away from him and switched places so that she was on her back, her sweetness bared to him. Alpha male on top, in control, he slid his hands up her arms, lifting them above her head so her breasts were ready again for his tongue.</p><p>She was beautiful and sweet in a spicy way, and all his.</p><p>She smiled at him and licked her lips with a slow slide meant to prime him. But he had been ready to finish this before they\u2019d even shed one article of clothing. He slid his leg over hers and pinned her to the couch. Her lids lowered, and he gently touched her lips with his. He craved her more than he\u2019d ever desired anyone.</p><p>As soon as he kissed her, she ran her hands over his arms, her touch tantalizingly sensual. Then she lifted her leg between his, gently pressing against his stiff erection. He groaned, and her lips twitched upward slightly. But he wouldn\u2019t be pushed into a quick resolution.</p><p>He lowered his head and latched his mouth onto one of her nipples again, the bud puckered for his enjoyment. She moaned and ran her hands through his hair, her fingertips massaging his scalp with such finesse that he wanted to rest his head against her breast and give in to the sensual feel. He couldn\u2019t decide which gave him more pleasure, hearing her light moans as his fingers stroked her swollen nub, or the way she caressed him\u2014 as if he was as precious to her as he felt she was to him.</p><p>With her orgasm still fluttering deep inside her, he slipped his erection into her and thrust again and again, deeper, harder, primal with wanting, as he claimed his mate forever.</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d she cried out when he couldn\u2019t hold onto the moment any longer and filled her with his seed.</p><p>He had meant to build up slowly, to make her enjoy the pleasure of him touching her last, but she arched against his fingers, her breathing shallow, her heartbeat pounding wildly, her eyes closed as her tongue wetted her lips, and he knew she couldn\u2019t last much longer. She was the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever been with\u2014from the golden blonde hair framing her alabaster skin to nicely rounded breasts that made his mouth water for another taste, and nipples dusky pink and fully extended for his pleasure.</p><p>\u201cAh, Ryan,\u201d she whispered, her heated little body arching one last time. She sighed and licked her lips again, the orgasm rippling through her in another cascade of waves.</p><p>No one had ever said his name with such eroticism, longing, and need.</p><p>For a minute, he lay snuggled together with Carol, loving the feel of her silky warmth, the vitality of her beating heart, the sweet scent that was unique to a red female, and even more special because of Carol\u2019s alluring fragrance. He had spent five months obsessing over her, and now she truly was his.</p><p>Teaching her the way of the wolf was next on the agenda. That trial had only begun.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>SNUGGLED AGAINST RYAN\u2019S HOT, MUSCLED FRAME, Carol needed a moment to realize that someone was at the basement door trying to get in, shattering her blissful contentment.</p><p>\u201cCarol and that gray outsider have locked the damn door to the basement. I\u2019ve tried to reach her, but there\u2019s no answer on her cell phone. Are you sure that you have the key to the facilities down here?\u201d Nurse Matthew asked outside the door to the lab, lounge, and laundry area.</p> <p>\u201cOh, hell,\u201d Carol said, scrambling to untangle herself from Ryan on the staff-lounge sofa. \u201cWe must have fallen asleep.\u201d She searched for her bra and frowned.</p><p>Naked, his body a chiseled wonder, Ryan put his arms behind his head and watched her.</p><p>Her face heated as he eyed her breasts. If she and Ryan had been someplace else, someplace more private, and had the circumstances been different, she would have told the intruders to go away.</p><p>\u201cLater, Ryan,\u201d she said, her voice still hushed. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>He got up off the couch slowly like a wolf, took her shoulders, and then kissed her mouth leisurely and with meaning. He had claimed her; she was his; and everyone had better get used to the idea.</p><p>All right, all right, so she was his. And he was all hers, too. But this was not the time to prove it.</p><p>She nipped his mouth. \u201cHelp me find my bra.\u201d She hurried to pull on her panties, her scrub pants, and then her tennis shoes.</p><p>He searched under the couch and around his pile of clothes. \u201cDon\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a dark look. \u201cFine. Get dressed. Hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the janitor\u2019s keys, and one should unlock the door,\u201d Jake said, his voice a little louder than necessary, as if he was warning Ryan and Carol to get ready for the incoming invasion. One key, then another was inserted in the lock, metal against metal.</p><p>\u201cJake,\u201d Carol whispered.</p><p>\u201cHurry it up,\u201d Matthew said.</p><p>\u201cThere are at least fifty keys on this ring. You know which one it is?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Ryan dragged his shirt on and slipped into his pants. Carol ran her fingers through her hair, trying to put it in some kind of order. Then she hurried over to the lab and retrieved the lab tech\u2019s report and blood samples from Doc Weber in his wolf form.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Doc Weber?\u201d Jake asked Matthew conversationally, still playing with the keys in the lock.</p><p>Thank you, Jake, Carol said silently.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wolf napping again in his office on a dog pad they brought over from the vet\u2019s kennel after Doc refused to lie on his bed. As fastidious as he is, he probably didn\u2019t want to shed fur on the linens. He\u2019s still running a fever and coughing. The shift didn\u2019t knock out the virus like it should have. So he can\u2019t have had human flu.\u201d</p><p>Carol examined the blood sample under an electron microscope, observing roughly spherical shapes that were covered in rigid spikes like a halo. Some halo.</p><p>She glanced back at Ryan to see if he was dressed yet. He had finished buttoning his shirt and shoving the tails into his pants and was giving her a devilish wink and a little smile when the door lock clicked open. She shook her head at him. In his macho way, he just had to prove to Darien\u2019s pack that she was his. Not that she minded. At least no other male would think she was fair game any longer.</p><p>Ryan zipped up his zipper and buckled his belt as Jake and Matthew walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cThe men who were shot are here,\u201d Matthew said to Carol, giving Ryan a scathing look. \u201cWhy did you lock the damn door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor protection,\u201d Ryan said as Carol\u2019s face grew hot with embarrassment. \u201cIn case North or his gang happened to break into the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe men who were shot?\u201d Matthew reiterated. \u201cDarien had to send some folks over to Doc Mitchell\u2019s place to care for the animals in his kennel until they can locate the vet. It\u2019s not like the doc to disappear without a word to anyone, especially when a lot of pets needed his care and no one was scheduled to take care of them in his absence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got canine influenza,\u201d Carol said finally. \u201cDoc Weber does. The respiratory illness causes coughing, runny nose, and fever,\u201d she added for Jake and Ryan\u2019s benefit. \u201cWe can medicate him, make sure he has plenty of fluids, and help him through this. If any of you don\u2019t know, the virus was first found in horses, but then it transferred to greyhounds. But it doesn\u2019t transfer to humans.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at the men, her expression worried. \u201cHe could get pneumonia.\u201d</p><p>Matthew frowned at her. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make any sense, since the canine virus doesn\u2019t transfer to humans. He was sick before he shifted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe virus he has can\u2019t transfer to humans. I\u2019m sure he had a human flu virus before the shift, but we don\u2019t have a blood test from him while he was human to prove it. If so, the virus he had before he shifted might not be one that can\u2019t transfer to canines. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI believe what we have here is a novel virus. One that is an offshoot of another. Maybe. I don\u2019t know for sure. But the virus appears to affect the werewolf kind. This inability to shift back has to have something to do with the virus. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded. \u201cSounds like that could be the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had any flu-like symptoms, have any of you?\u201d she asked them.</p> <p>Impressed at the logical way Carol dealt with a medical mystery, just like he would in a P.I. investigation, Ryan peered over her shoulder at the lab results.</p><p>\u201cNo. I think you might be right. Everyone in the pack needs to be warned not to shift if they can avoid it. Especially if there\u2019s any indication they\u2019re coming down with a bout of the flu. Hell, I need to notify my pack and my sister.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his phone off his belt, hoping no one in Green Valley had been inflicted with the virus, if that\u2019s what it was. He called his sister first.</p><p>\u201cRosalind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell? Did you finally see the light with Carol?\u201d She sounded like she knew he had, even before he told her so.</p> <p>\u201cListen, we\u2019ve got problems here.\u201d</p><p>His sister remained silent. She knew that when his voice took on that dark tone, he meant business. \u201cAt least one of the people in Carol\u2019s pack has come down sick with something. A flu-like virus, it appears. It seems that if a person with this virus shifts into the wolf, he or she can\u2019t shape-shift back into human form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious!\u201d Her voice was more than concerned.</p><p>\u201cI am serious about this. I\u2019ll call my second in command, but I don\u2019t want you to be exposed to anyone until we can sort this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! This is the biggest season for my nursery business, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosalind.\u201d He only had to say her name once for her to know how grave this was.</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cCarol discovered it, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Carol. \u201cYeah, Carol\u2019s the one who discovered the sickness and the results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough her visions, right?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so you\u2019ve said already, and I\u2019ve finally... well, hell, she\u2019s got really good hunches.\u201d He gave Carol an elusive smile as she raised a brow at him.</p><p>\u201cNot just hunches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the real deal.\u201d His voice turned more commanding. \u201cDon\u2019t shift, all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right already. I said I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He let out his breath. \u201cI\u2019ve got to call my sub-leader. I\u2019ll be home soon. Keep yourself isolated from the others. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you when I know anything new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck, Ryan. She\u2019ll do it. She\u2019ll find a cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you can see the future?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then his sister said, \u201cYeah, just like I know that if you haven\u2019t taken her for your mate already, you will soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Rosalind.\u201d He wasn\u2019t about to say anything to her about mating Carol while Jake and Matthew were listening in on the conversation. He clicked off the phone.</p><p>\u201cHunches, huh?\u201d Carol asked Ryan.</p><p>\u201cYeah, damn good ones. It\u2019s going to take a while to get used to you knowing things before I do... in an unscientific way, but...\u201d He shrugged, punched in another number, and said, \u201cGranbury, it\u2019s McKinley. Find out who all in our pack might be sick with a flu-like virus. Upper respiratory ailments. Make sure you warn them not to shift. That has dire consequences.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at Carol and found her observing him, a frown knitting her brow.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t shift back if they turn into the wolf. I know it sounds crazy, but I\u2019ve got an expert on the case. No one else who can help it should shift, either. But especially those with the flu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour administrative assistant was sick this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell. Has she shifted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of. She called in sick today. I\u2019ll call her, and if I don\u2019t get an answer, I\u2019ll run by her place and warn her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Make sure she gets plenty of fluids. The canine flu isn\u2019t supposed to transfer to humans, but the way this is affecting our people, we\u2019re not sure of the effects with the shift. I\u2019ll give you an update as soon as I can. And let me know what\u2019s going on with Ingrid.\u201d He snapped his phone shut and put it away.</p><p>Carol gave Ryan a weary smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Carol. I guess I was just too set in my ways before.\u201d</p><p>Jake raised his brows when Carol looked at him. He was studying her way too much. His gaze shifted from her to Ryan.</p><p>She rose from the chair and headed for the stairs. \u201cHow are the wounded men doing?\u201d she asked Matthew.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine. They\u2019re still in their wolf form. The bullets aren\u2019t silver. But the men lost some blood, and all three are sick with whatever Doc probably has. Three of them suffered hind leg wounds. One was hit in the rump,\u201d Matthew said, leading the way up the stairs, Carol following behind. \u201cIf we could have found Doc Mitchell, he could have performed the surgery at his vet clinic.\u201d</p><p>Ryan watched as Carol disappeared and then turned to see what Jake was doing in the staff lounge.</p><p>Jake glanced at the couch and drew closer. Then he bent over it and poked around. Hell. Jake pulled the silk bra out from between the back and seat cushions and took a deep breath. He shook his head and tossed the bra to Ryan.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you two took the plunge.\u201d He gave Ryan a dark smile. \u201cAbout time. But Darien will not be pleased.\u201d</p><p>Ryan tucked the incriminating evidence into his pocket. Carol would not be pleased to know Jake had found her bra, and while he didn\u2019t like to keep secrets from his mate, he had no plans to tell her about this.</p><p>He took off for the stairs, and Jake followed him. As soon as Carol finished treating the injured men, Ryan had every intention of transporting her home. To his home. His bed. He had people who could keep her safe just like Darien did. Now she belonged to his pack, not Darien\u2019s. And if his own people could suffer the same trouble as Darien\u2019s, Ryan needed to be there for them. He rubbed his chin in thought. As long as she could do her research in Green Valley. He\u2019d have to make sure she could.</p><p>After they arrived at the operating room, Jake and Ryan served as guards and waited inside by the door. While Matthew assisted, Carol removed the bullet from the first of the patients. Ryan admired Carol for her dedication to the patient\u2019s care. She worked efficiently with steady hands, her deportment self-assured. Matthew aided her, his expression one of deep admiration, as if he had every confidence in her abilities. When she stitched the man\u2019s wound closed, she looked as though she could work like this all night. She had to be tired, but she didn\u2019t let on.</p><p>\u201cI keep telling you that you ought to be a doctor, Carol,\u201d Matthew said. \u201cBefore Doc Weber arrived here, you\u2019d removed how many bullets from pack members?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree men wounded in that bank robbery. We heal faster, as long as the bullets aren\u2019t made of silver. Rifle bullets can do a lot of permanent damage to humans, but our bodies will heal from the injury, given time. So it\u2019s not the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the smarts and the skill to do it, Carol,\u201d Matthew argued.</p><p>She might believe she wasn\u2019t capable of doing the job, but with her determination, Ryan thought differently. If she wanted further medical training, he\u2019d back her all the way. But one thing was certain: his Green Valley pack needed a lupus garou who had the medical skills she did. He needed to arrange for a wolf doctor to start a clinic, and she could attend him. If she wanted further training after that, Ryan was all for it.</p><p>Matthew bound the man\u2019s injured leg, and then they moved on to the next man.</p><p>Avery. Hell, he was sick now. And he\u2019d danced with Carol. She\u2019d been around Doc all day, too. Ryan had danced with Marilee, and she also was ill. He wondered how long the rest of them had before they shifted with no way to change back.</p><p>Ryan turned to Jake. \u201cWhere are Marilee and Becky now? They\u2019re both sick with this crud. If they\u2019ve got it, we don\u2019t want them returning to their pack and carrying the virus there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they brought it from their pack?\u201d Jake jerked his phone out of its pouch and punched in a number. \u201cBertha? This is Jake. Marilee and Becky were staying at your bed and breakfast, right?\u201d He frowned and then stared at Ryan. \u201cHell. All right. I\u2019ll tell Darien and give Ryan the word.\u201d</p><p>Jake hung up and punched another button.</p><p>\u201cDarien,\u201d he sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ve got more trouble.\u201d</p><p>Carol finished removing the bullet from the third wounded man, although concentrating had become an effort as soon as Ryan and Jake left the operating room to discuss some new trouble with Darien in private.</p><p>Matthew said, \u201cWonder what else is going on.\u201d</p><p>Carol took a deep breath. \u201cNothing good, we can be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did it with him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up from stitching the man\u2019s wound closed. Matthew looked slightly annoyed, eyes narrowed, lips pursed. \u201cIf you mean Ryan and I are mated, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll expect you to leave right away. To move to Green Valley. To take care of his people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying here until we resolve this.\u201d Beyond that, she hadn\u2019t really thought of leaving. Just that she\u2019d be Ryan\u2019s mate. Why hadn\u2019t she even considered it? Did they have a hospital in Green Valley? Certainly not one that was run by werewolves, she imagined. Would she be able to get a position? Should she even try, considering her shifting problem?</p><p>She ground her teeth and sighed. \u201cLike you heard Jake say, if we\u2019re all infected because we\u2019ve been exposed to this, we can\u2019t go spreading it to other packs.\u201d She figured that went without saying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t think that, Carol. He\u2019s a pack leader. His place is with his pack. He\u2019ll want to be there in case this hits his people. His sister and his aunt are there. Family takes priority. You wait. If one case of this sickness hits Green Valley, he\u2019ll want to drag you back there pronto.\u201d</p><p>She finished with her patient and was about to reply that Ryan wouldn\u2019t be that way when Nurse Charlotte came in for her work shift. Jake accompanied her, but Ryan wasn\u2019t with them.</p><p>Carol had a bad feeling about that.</p> <p>Charlotte sighed heavily. \u201cLooks like we have an epidemic of our kind getting sick and then not being able to shift back to their human forms. Now the humans think the wolves are invading Silver Town and the surrounding area. So they\u2019re taking up guns to get rid of the menace.\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head. \u201cFive men have already been arrested and thrown in the slammer. One said something about Darien being a wolf lover, and Darien just smiled in a sinister way. None have lawyers, so the court will appoint them.\u201d Jake gave an evil smile.</p><p>\u201cAll werewolf lawyers. They\u2019ll get the maximum fine\u2014$20,000\u2014five years suspended hunting license, and sixty days in jail for harassing wildlife on private property, carrying loaded weapons in a vehicle without a permit, firing across a road, and anything else witnesses will attest to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLupus garou witnesses,\u201d Carol said, half commenting, half questioning.</p><p>\u201cExactly. Silver Town is werewolf run, and we plan to keep it that way.\u201d</p> <p>Carol chewed on her bottom lip and rubbed her arms. \u201cSomeone needs to take care of Doc Weber and watch him around the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cYou run along now. My shift. You\u2019ve already worked yours and more hours than you ought to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Charlotte. Hopefully you\u2019ll have a quiet night.\u201d Carol left the hospital with Jake, flanked by Mervin and Christian. She expected Ryan to be waiting outside the operating room, but he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ryan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and the sheriff had to question Marilee and Becky at the bed and breakfast,\u201d Jake said as he walked her to his truck. \u201cWhen I called Bertha to learn if the women\u2019s pack members were sick, she said a man had infected the two women to get back at Darien. Only now the man won\u2019t give them the cure. This isn\u2019t just a normal virus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just a mutation of some sort that affects our people?\u201d Carol\u2019s head spun with the ramifications. \u201cSome sick bastard bioengineered this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, and then Miller gave it to them to infect our pack. Connor paid the lupus garou scientist to come up with the plague. Becky and Marilee wanted to start their own businesses, and Connor was going to give them a hefty sum for carrying the plague to our gathering. The only satisfaction any of us have is that Connor and some of his pack have come down with it. The women will have the same trouble dealing with it.\u201d</p><p>Ryan drove into the parking lot, parked next to Jake\u2019s vehicle, and hurried out of his truck. His jaw was hard, his eyes dark. The news wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>\u201cDid the scientist make a vaccine?\u201d Carol asked both Jake and Ryan.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to learn.\u201d Ryan hauled her close and held her tight as if he\u2019d been away for eons. He brushed her cheek with his lips and then said to Jake, \u201cWe\u2019re headed back to the house.\u201d</p><p>Jake had an odd look on his face and didn\u2019t move toward his own truck to follow them.</p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d Carol said.</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cYou saw me shift and not be able to change back.\u201d</p><p>He finally seemed to believe her. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m wrong,\u201d Carol said. \u201cMaybe I just see you shift, but like everyone keeps reminding me, I don\u2019t see the end result. That you shift back.\u201d</p> <p>But Jake\u2019s expression remained dark.</p><p>She patted his arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a vaccine. And a cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this damned Miller,\u201d Ryan said, hauling Carol into the truck. \u201cSee you at Darien\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right behind you,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>As soon as they were on the road, Carol said to Ryan, \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t told Jake what I\u2019d seen.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shook his head and tugged her close. \u201cWe\u2019ll get this under control.\u201d</p><p>But behind his words she was certain she heard the worry that they might not.</p><p>\u201cDarien\u2019s going to be pissed about us mating when we didn\u2019t say anything to him about it beforehand.\u201d</p><p>Ryan let out his breath, wanting Carol away from this nightmare immediately. \u201cEven more so when I tell him that you\u2019re coming home with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at Ryan as if he\u2019d lost his mind, and he knew as soon as she did that she wasn\u2019t going to agree with his plan. But he had his own pack and his own place. Staying as a guest at Darien\u2019s wasn\u2019t in the plans. He had to investigate Connor and Miller\u2019s hideout, but he thought that if Carol was with his pack, Connor and North and the rest of them would never learn of her whereabouts and she\u2019d be safer.</p><p>\u201cI want to take you home with me,\u201d he said, a little more amenable this time. He hadn\u2019t even considered she might object.</p><p>\u201cI have to stay and figure out a way to cure this. Unless you have a doctor in Green Valley who might have some idea of what to do.\u201d</p><p>He sure wished he did. If the doctor had been a lupus garou, he might have helped. But as a human, he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNo, Carol, he\u2019s human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman?\u201d She said it like the man was an alien just arrived from another planet when she\u2019d been strictly human herself not that long ago.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t allow him to learn what we are.\u201d Ryan was unsure why the fact the doctor was human distressed her. Unless she\u2019d had high hopes he could help with this.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see Doc Mitchell change in a premonition, did you, Carol?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>CAROL SIGHED DEEPLY AND RESTED HER HEAD AGAINST Ryan\u2019s shoulder as the truck rumbled toward Darien\u2019s house. She was tired, but this virus had to be stopped and the effects counteracted.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t seen any visions of Doc Mitchell.\u201d Carol wished she had\u2014anything to know what had happened to him. She snuggled closer to Ryan, feeling more chilled by the situation they were in than by the weather.</p><p>\u201cBut the way the doc disappeared makes me surmise that either North and his men kidnapped him, thinking that he might be able to help with their medical problem, or he shifted, ran off, and was unable to change back. If North and his newly formed pack came down with this before we did, I need to interview them.\u201d</p><p>Ryan stiffened beside her. \u201cYou can learn what you have to over the phone. You\u2019re not meeting any of North\u2019s people face-to-face. I\u2019ll be leading a force to learn their whereabouts, the lab they\u2019ve been using\u2014 and hopefully find a vaccine.\u201d</p><p>She tapped her fingers on her lap. \u201cIt\u2019s remotely possible our people could eventually change back on their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that most likely would mean only a few like Lelandi, who is a royal, could avoid shifting during any phase of the moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if...\u201d Carol\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cWhat if when the new moon appears, the condition vanishes? Those of us who aren\u2019t royals can\u2019t maintain our wolf forms. So what if the condition ceased to exist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But the first full moon made its appearance this morning. The three-quarter moon appears in the morning nine days later, and the new moon, eight days after that in the evening. That\u2019s a long time to wait to see if we make it out of this on our own.\u201d</p><p>Surprised he\u2019d know the exact timing of the phases of the moon, she raised her brows.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d considered the moon\u2019s phases might knock out this anomaly, so I checked the timing of the phases for Colorado for this month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph, you could have told me you\u2019d already thought of it.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed her arm. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been a werewolf long enough to think in those terms all the time. So what happens if half our pack or more can\u2019t keep from shifting while we wait about seventeen days for the new moon to appear? What if the town is no longer run by the werewolf kind? And humans decide to take over? Worse, what if those who are stuck in their wolf shapes are still unable to shift back when the new moon appears?\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s phone rang, and he saw it was his assistant mayor. \u201cYeah, Grandbury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour admin assistant is fine. Ingrid had already shifted and changed back. She knocked out whatever ailed her\u2014she suspected food poisoning and that whatever she ate could be more easily tolerated by her wolf\u2019s stomach\u2014and she returned to work. She didn\u2019t want me to tell you in case she shouldn\u2019t have shifted, per your orders. But she didn\u2019t get word until it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll check on her shortly.\u201d Vastly relieved, Ryan put away his cell phone. \u201cMy admin assistant was sick, shifted, knocked out what appeared to be food poisoning, and shifted back to her human self,\u201d he told Carol.</p><p>She relaxed against him.</p><p>\u201cWe may have an isolated case of this virus here in Silver Town. Which probably means that Connor and his bunch did engineer this sickness and brought it specifically to Darien\u2019s people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank goodness. If we can immunize enough people in the area\u2014it\u2019s called \u2018herd immunity,\u2019 in our case the term \u2018pack immunity\u2019 suits us better\u2014we could stop the spread of the virus. But letting other packs know about a vaccine wouldn\u2019t be easy, would it? Lelandi said that the packs are not very open about where they\u2019re located.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s worry later about other packs contracting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. So we need to know who was sick in our pack first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen they were dancing, Mervin said Becky told him she was worried about shifting and not being able to change back. He thought it was a strange thing to say and just figured she\u2019d had some weird nightmares. But the word has spread through the pack that Doc Weber can\u2019t shift back due to this virus, and now she\u2019s really scared.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe should be.\u201d Carol frowned and then shook her head. \u201cA virus can be contagious from a day before a person becomes aware of having it to five days after. What if Marilee and Becky brought the virus from their pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve checked,\u201d Ryan said. She admired the way he could put his investigative skills to use and was one step ahead of her. He continued, \u201cTheir pack is clean. But it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Carol asked.</p> <p>\u201cBecky and Marilee haven\u2019t been with the pack for a couple of weeks. I suspect they\u2019ve been with Connor\u2019s people all this time.\u201d</p><p>Carol swore under her breath. \u201cAnd you danced with Marilee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because she was acting nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you danced with her out of concern for her?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled darkly. \u201cNo, because she seemed unduly nervous. Like she\u2019d set an explosive device in the house and wanted to leave. It made me curious, but when I tried to learn what the matter was, I didn\u2019t get anywhere with her. I assumed she was just anxious about finding the right mate. Now it seems she was even hotter than I suspected\u2014germ warfare.\u201d</p> <p>Carol pressed her lips tighter together. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone doing anything so despicable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOffer money and a lot of people will do something they\u2019d never do otherwise.\u201d</p><p>A frisson of dread suddenly worked its way up Carol\u2019s spine. Before she could analyze what was making her feel so antsy, her vision blurred and she closed her eyes, not welcoming the vision and what it might foretell, but having no choice. Ryan\u2019s words faded into the background like a conversation in the distance as the vision clarified.</p><p>As a wolf, Darien paced, panting, his teeth and lips bloodied. Wounded, he limped. A dead wolf lay near the bed on the blue carpet in his and Lelandi\u2019s bedroom. Carol felt Darien\u2019s satisfaction that the wolf was dead\u2014and his frustration and dread because he couldn\u2019t change. He was stuck as a wolf.</p><p>Lelandi looked miserable, tears streaking her cheeks as she wrung her hands. Carol wanted to help and console her. But then Lelandi grabbed her phone off the bedside table and punched a button.</p><p>Carol\u2019s phone rang and nearly gave her a heart attack, yanking her from the vision. Perspiration trickled between her breasts, and her heart rate accelerated as she pulled her phone out of her pocket and looked at the Caller ID. \u201cLelandi?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome home quick. I need to see you. But no one else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Lelandi didn\u2019t have to tell Carol what had happened, that Darien had been victorious in a wolf fight, but he couldn\u2019t shift back. It was too late for Darien, too late for Doc.</p><p>\u201cNot a word to the others,\u201d Lelandi made Carol promise.</p><p>\u201cAll right. We\u2019re nearly there.\u201d Carol hung up her phone, trying not to shake. Everyone would have to know their pack leader was in a real bind. Jake and Tom would have to take over until Darien could change back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ryan asked, pulling into the drive and parking in front of Darien\u2019s home.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour face has lost every ounce of color, Carol. Your voice shook when you spoke with Lelandi. You\u2019re not a good liar.\u201d</p><p>She ground her teeth and looked at Ryan. Lelandi didn\u2019t want her to tell, but everyone would know before long anyway.</p> <p>\u201cDarien\u2019s shifted. And he can\u2019t change back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>Jake parked his truck next to Ryan\u2019s vehicle and hurried out. \u201cLelandi just called me. Told me the news.\u201d He gave Carol an anxious look.</p><p>Lelandi must have realized she couldn\u2019t hide the fact that Darien couldn\u2019t shift back. Did Jake worry he would be next?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find the lab where these men made the virus and destroy it, Jake,\u201d Ryan said, taking Carol\u2019s arm and guiding her toward the house.</p><p>Wolves in motion, Tom and Sam bolted from around the side of the house, and Carol jumped. Her heart took a dive. They shouldn\u2019t have shifted.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Jake said to his brother and Sam. \u201cYou better be able to shift back.\u201d He opened the door to the house, and the wolves dashed inside and up the stairs, tails straight out, indicating both were tense.</p><p>\u201cI should go with you, Ryan. To identify the vaccine, if they have one.\u201d Carol figured Ryan would say no because he\u2019d worry about her safety, but she really thought it was the best way to handle this. \u201cIf they have a lab that produced the virus, they may have created a vaccine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLelandi wants to see you,\u201d Jake said to Carol, motioning to the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare go anywhere without me, Ryan McKinley.\u201d She gave him a hard look, hoping that he wouldn\u2019t take off to search for the lab and leave her behind. Then she ran up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI see who\u2019s in charge in your family already,\u201d Jake said with a smirk.</p><p>Ryan folded his arms and watched her disappear upstairs. \u201cI would leave her behind for her own safety. But she\u2019s got a valid point. We need her with us. You need to stay with Lelandi. I\u2019ll take Tom and Sam with me.\u201d As an afterthought, he added, \u201cIf that works well for you.\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head. \u201cCan\u2019t give up being a natural born leader, can you, Ryan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, it\u2019s in the blood.\u201d He just hoped he wasn\u2019t making a grave mistake by taking Carol into the enemy\u2019s territory.</p><p>Carol knocked on Lelandi\u2019s bedroom door, not wanting to intrude on her and Darien and their new dilemma. She felt terrible. If she couldn\u2019t solve this situation, Lelandi\u2019s children would never know their father as human.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Carol,\u201d Lelandi said, opening the door, her voice tinged with alarm as she waited for Carol to enter the bedroom. Lelandi wrung her hands and watched Darien pace back and forth in his wolf form. Thankfully, someone had removed the dead wolf\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening? I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. How can we stop this?\u201d Lelandi asked. Her green eyes turned to Carol, and tears filled them. \u201cHe can\u2019t change back. You have to do something!\u201d Lelandi pleaded, her voice strained and choked with emotion.</p><p>Carol took Lelandi\u2019s hands and guided her to sit down on the bed.</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath. Calm yourself. We\u2019ll figure this out and reverse the effects.\u201d</p><p>At least she hoped so. What if they could only vaccinate against the virus before someone contracted it, but there was no hope for those poor souls who already had it? \u201cDo you know who Darien just killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Connor. Darien killed his brother after the guy bit you. During the initial battle, Connor had given up the fight so Darien had let him live. Not this time.\u201d</p><p>Carol rubbed Lelandi\u2019s arm. \u201cSo he came here to avenge his brother\u2019s death, I suppose. His plan to make us all sick hadn\u2019t worked out the way he wanted, so he\u2019d decided to kill Darien. I wonder if they thought they could take over Silver Town if all of us had gotten sick and couldn\u2019t change back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. The renegade reds left their pack. What better way to start over than to come into a town already run by werewolves, eliminate the leadership through the use of the virus, and take over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept that it backfired, because now they\u2019re getting sick, too. What happened to the men who were protecting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey chased the other three reds off. Connor stayed to fight Darien.\u201d</p><p>Carol nodded, figuring this was one thing she\u2019d never get used to, fighting amongst wolves. \u201cWhere\u2019s Silva? She was supposed to be staying with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDownstairs making me hot cocoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019m going to leave with Ryan and some others to try to find the reds\u2019 lab. In the meantime, Darien and Jake can protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be.\u201d Carol gave Lelandi a hug, fought the urge to pat Darien on the head\u2014figuring he probably would not appreciate it\u2014and hurried out of the master bedroom. When she reached her room, she ditched her scrubs and changed into jeans and a sweater, and then joined Jake and Ryan downstairs in the great room. To her profound relief, she watched Tom and Sam exit the kitchen, tall and dressed and very human.</p><p>Ryan asked, \u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>A big gray wolf loped out of the kitchen, headed straight for her, and her mouth gaped. \u201cDoc Mitchell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of the men found him on his way to the house to see Darien. He\u2019s been trying to tell us something, but we\u2019re not sure what. We think he may have been searching for these guys long before we were aware of what was going on,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s go.\u201d Ryan took hold of Carol\u2019s arm and hurried her out to the truck. Doc Mitchell loped alongside them.</p><p>\u201cGuess he thinks he can help,\u201d Carol said, and she prayed he could.</p><p>Driving south from Darien\u2019s place, Carol and Ryan were quiet as Doc Mitchell rode in the backseat of the truck while Tom and Sam followed in Tom\u2019s truck. Carol watched Doc Mitchell\u2019s antics and interpreted them. He wagged his tail when they took the right roads and growled when they didn\u2019t.</p><p>If Carol hadn\u2019t been worried about how they might all become just like him, stuck forever as wolves with human brains, she would have admired his ability to guide them in the right direction. Even more, she worried that she might not be able to find the cure.</p><p>She took a deep breath, tried to give up thoughts of failure, and considered another situation that concerned her\u2014bringing were-kids into the world, where they had to live in secret. She didn\u2019t think she could cope with taking care of them, not when she hadn\u2019t been raised as one. She thought about her mother\u2019s comment that she should talk with Ryan about children before they were married, or in this case, mated. Better late than never.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want children,\u201d she blurted before she thought better of it. Now really wasn\u2019t the time to discuss this.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s hands tightened a little on the steering wheel as he continued to watch the road. \u201cIt\u2019s a little late to consider that now.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound mad, just a little concerned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m on birth control.\u201d She hadn\u2019t needed it for a long time, but she always wanted to be prepared\u2014just in case. At least she\u2019d been careful and not reckless.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t read his expression at first, but his pause made her think he wasn\u2019t happy with the idea.</p><p>\u201cPills?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYep. Not that I\u2019ve needed them, but...\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDoc give them to you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like the way he asked, as if he was investigating one of his cases. She folded her arms. \u201cNo. I had enough of a supply before he came to work here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo... no one told you they won\u2019t work for us.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t work for all women,\u201d he said.</p><p>She knew that from personal experience because a friend of hers had gotten pregnant while on the pill\u2014but at least her friend had been married. Her friend\u2019s sister also had gotten pregnant on the pill, only she was in love with the guy, not married. The day she learned she was pregnant, she also discovered her lover had a wife and two daughters. Bastard. And he had no intention of leaving his wife, because her dad was a rich man and would have ruined him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d she said, annoyed.</p><p>\u201cWell, our women are like that. We normally don\u2019t use birth control. Like humans, some of us can have children without any problem. Others never do. But as with any pack mentality, procreation of our species is important and most of us want children. As a pack leader, it\u2019s essential. Are you afraid they\u2019ll have your psychic talents? And be ostracized?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He sounded like he regretted mentioning it. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow in the world can I teach my own were-children anything about growing up werewolf when I never did?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll learn, and that\u2019s what a pack is for. All pack members care for each other\u2019s kids.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cA mother is supposed to know these things and be in charge. I\u2019ll be like the child.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNot on your life. You\u2019ll be fine. Unless...\u201d He glanced at her. \u201c...you want to abstain from sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that\u2019s really an option.\u201d No way was she abstaining from anything of the kind with Ryan.</p><p>\u201cOther forms of birth control work reasonably well.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against him. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want kids. I always planned to have a couple. It\u2019s just this... were-issue.\u201d She guessed this was one more aspect she wouldn\u2019t have any control over. At least her mother would be happy. If she never learned what Carol\u2019s children\u2019s secrets were.</p><p>The tension left Ryan\u2019s body, and he wrapped his arm around her. \u201cIf we\u2019re meant to have children, we will. If not, so be it. But you\u2019ll be the best mother a litter can have, Carol. Don\u2019t you worry.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled, thinking of raising more McKinleys and attending the Scottish games, just like having their own little clan.</p><p>The thought of having a couple of sons who would help their dad in a game of tug-of-war, or a couple of daughters who danced to the Celtic tunes and captured the boys\u2019 attention, made her forget for the moment the potential danger that lay ahead.</p><p>About an hour and a half from Darien\u2019s home, Doc Mitchell began to pace in the backseat, make little woofing sounds, and growl. Her thoughts quickly shifted to the peril they could all be in.</p><p>\u201cMust be close,\u201d Carol warned, feeling Ryan\u2019s whole body tense. She was fairly certain that another wolf fight would ensue. These guys never seemed to resolve anything between them in a nice, conversational way. She tried to relax and not be uptight, but as soon as Ryan drove toward a single-family dwelling surrounded by woods, the tension returned to every muscle, and she prayed she wouldn\u2019t shift again.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>\u201cI WISH YOU HADN\u2019T COME,\u201d RYAN SAID. HE KISSED the side of her temple as they drove down the dirt road, closing in on what they thought was the location of the lab. His hand held hers as if he never wanted to let go.</p><p>\u201cI know. You want to keep me safe.\u201d She tried to force her voice to remain even and not sound like she was having second thoughts. She wasn\u2019t a warrior at heart. But she had the courage to overcome her failings when the circumstances warranted it. And these definitely did. She certainly didn\u2019t want Ryan to think he\u2019d made a mistake in bringing her.</p><p>Ryan drove down the bumpy, rutted road where tree limbs stretched into the lane, scraping the sides of the truck. He grumbled something under his breath about needing a new paint job after this operation. She figured his edginess probably had more to do with her being with him on one of his more dangerous investigative missions than with the paint job on his truck, especially the way he kept a tight grip on her fingers.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t complain. It felt good to have a man care about her the way he did. She was ready to move to Green Valley and start a life with him there.</p><p>When they came into a small clearing, she saw the house more clearly. It had three rooms, if that, with tall grass brushing against the bottom frames of the windows. Blue paint was peeling off the exterior clapboards, while the weathered shutters bordering the windows were missing slats. A rickety fireplace made of rough stone stuck to one side of the house with a couple of the corner stones missing. The house looked abandoned, except for the smoke trickling out of the chimney. Movement in one of the three windows caught Carol\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s home,\u201d Ryan said glumly.</p><p>\u201cHow will you get in?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>\u201cMost lupus garous carry lock picks.\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows in question.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIf we\u2019re in a city and have an uncontrollable urge to shift, finding an unoccupied house could be our only salvation. Lock picks are preferable to breaking windows.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in disbelief. She hadn\u2019t thought of being in a city without a place to hide in the event of shifting. She could just envision herself in that dilemma. What a disaster.</p><p>\u201cNo one gave me a set.\u201d</p><p>He patted her thigh. \u201cNo one\u2019s letting you out of their sight, either.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, realizing just how good she had it living in a werewolf-run town. How would it be for her living with Ryan in Green Valley where humans ran the place for the most part?</p><p>Ryan pulled up to the front porch, breaking into her mounting concern. He turned off the truck, saying at the same time, \u201cStay here until we secure the place. Lock the doors. Doc, you want to stay and guard Carol?\u201d He posed the comment as a question, but the intonation was more of a command.</p><p>Doc Mitchell gave a little woof. She took it as a yes. But she wanted Ryan and the others to have the doc\u2019s added protection since they were facing unknown perils.</p><p>\u201cTake him with you,\u201d Carol said. \u201cHe can help.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shook his head, his gaze studying her in a worried way. \u201cHe stays with you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and gave her a meaningful kiss that briefly chased away the chill in her bones. He squeezed her hand one last time. He let out his breath in a sigh of resignation and climbed out of the truck. Then he let out Doc Mitchell, who raced around to sit in wolf-guarding mode next to Carol\u2019s door.</p><p>She watched Ryan, her stomach bunched in tight knots, her skin icy with trepidation, praying that he wouldn\u2019t get himself killed.</p><p>Tom pulled up next to her passenger door, and he and Sam hurried out of the truck to join Ryan. Tom tilted his chin down, also giving Carol the silent order to stay put. They didn\u2019t have to tell her that she most likely would cause more problems if she entered the house before they checked it out. She folded her arms and glowered at Tom. His mouth lifted slightly, and he gave her a short nod.</p><p>Then he turned, and Ryan, Sam, and Tom stalked toward the house, backs straight, postures determined, like the Three Musketeers, except without the plumed hats and sharp steel swords. And that gave Carol another shiver of worry.</p><p>She barely breathed as Tom used his lock-picking tools to unlock the front door. Doc Mitchell\u2019s ears twitched with alertness, his body stiff with tension, making her more concerned that the three men were headed into danger.</p><p>When the front door opened. Ryan rushed in first, while Tom and Sam followed. The door remained wide open, and Doc Mitchell stood, his attention focused on the doorway, his hackles raised. Every hair on Doc\u2019s body stood on end, making him appear bigger and more ferocious.</p><p>Snarling erupted inside the house, and Doc Mitchell growled softly in response, his ears positioned to hear the sounds inside.</p><p>Carol\u2019s muscles were so tense that her leg cramped. She was pressing her foot against the truck\u2019s floorboard to work out the painful kink when Doc Mitchell started forward. Maybe he just wanted to assist Ryan and the others. Or maybe he was anxious to see what the others had found.</p><p>She wanted him to join the others in case they needed his help. She thought she\u2019d be safe enough in the vehicle. Yet the idea she\u2019d be alone without any kind of protection made her spine stiffen with dread.</p><p>The way he stood, muscles taut, wired to the max, Doc Mitchell seemed ready to bolt. Then, as if he\u2019d remembered his duty, he glanced back at Carol.</p><p>For a long moment, their gazes held. His amber eyes asked her a wealth of questions. Did she want him to stay? Did she want him to watch the men\u2019s backs? What did she want him to do?</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she said, motioning toward the house with tears in her eyes. She\u2019d never forgive herself if anything bad happened to Ryan, Tom, or Sam and she\u2019d denied Doc Mitchell the chance to help.</p><p>Doc hesitated, his head riveting back on the house.</p><p>She again said, \u201cGo. Help them! I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her again, bowed his head, turned, and dashed around the back side of the place.</p><p>Her mouth gaped. Why hadn\u2019t he gone inside? The doorway still stood wide open, as if daring her to come inside. She took a deep, unsettling breath and prayed the men would all be okay. That whoever was inside wouldn\u2019t attack them. That they would find a vaccine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ryan had barely entered the old, rickety house, its wooden floors creaking as they walked inside, when he heard low growls coming from a hallway past the living room. The place smelled of mold and dust. In the main living room, where faded floral wallpaper peeled off the walls in sheets, three sofas with sagging cushions were covered with wolf fur and reeked with the odor of wet wolves. A little wolf bark emanated from a room with a closed door off to the right of the living room.</p><p>Tom motioned to the room, wanting to check it out. Dealing with a she-wolf and her pups could be a dangerous proposition, especially while the three of them were all in human form. The wolf could easily tear into them. But more of the pack might be hiding in the room, too. Ryan agreed with Tom and gave him the go-ahead.</p><p>They walked down the short hall, and when they reached the room, Tom turned the doorknob. Locked. Sam watched their backs while Tom used his lock pick on the door. The lock clicked open. He glanced at Ryan, waiting for his approval. Ryan nodded.</p> <p>Tom turned the handle slowly and it moved with a rusty, grinding squeak.</p><p>A low growl came from the other side of the door. An adult female growl.</p><p>As humans, Ryan and the others had no chance against a wolf\u2019s teeth. If it was a she-wolf and her pups, he had no intention of shooting her. But he couldn\u2019t risk Tom\u2019s life if the female attacked, or if others were in the room that might.</p><p>\u201cShift first,\u201d Ryan whispered to Tom.</p><p>Tom\u2019s mouth gaped.</p> <p>\u201cIf she attacks, you can pin her down. I\u2019ll do the talking.\u201d</p><p>Tom agreed and quickly stripped out of his clothes. After shifting, he butted the door open with his nose before Ryan could push it aside, and stood in the entryway. Ryan was at Tom\u2019s side, gun in hand, to deliver the message that he\u2019d shoot if anyone attacked, but only if he had no other choice.</p><p>A mother wolf stood with three little ones trying to reach her teats for supper. Another female growled low as she stood nearby in a protective stance, her belly bulging with pups. She was due to birth her own litter soon.</p><p>Ryan holstered his gun. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>The nursing mother sat, the tension draining from her, and her pups scrambled over each other, vying for a meal. The other mother remained standing, wary and protective. As a gray male wolf, Tom was still a threat to a couple of red females.</p><p>\u201cCan you shift back?\u201d Ryan asked the females. The nursing mother shook her head. Just as Ryan had suspected. That meant either they had shifted after they locked the door, or someone had locked them in.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got movement in another room,\u201d Sam warned.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back for you,\u201d Ryan said. He motioned for Tom to come with him. Once he was out of the room, Ryan shut the door so that the females couldn\u2019t try to rescue their mates if a confrontation resulted.</p><p>Ryan, Tom, and Sam went through the living area and then a kitchen. Surprisingly, the kitchen was spotless, although coffee and tea stained much of the counter near a teakettle, and part of the backdrop was coming unglued. But the fragrance of orange cleanser wafted in the air; the counters were clean with no dishes; and the porcelain sink sparkled. He wondered if the females had recently shifted.</p><p>Another short hall led to two more rooms. The door was unlocked and yielded to show a bedroom furnished with a queen-sized bed that was richly cloaked in a velvet comforter and velvet decorator pillows, all dark brown. The walls were freshly painted, and the place appeared to be under renovation. No pictures hung on the walls, and new carpet covered the floor.</p><p>A red male had slept here, but Ryan didn\u2019t detect any scent he\u2019d smelled before.</p><p>They moved to the next door and found it locked. Ryan pulled out his set of lock picks, as Sam said in a hushed voice, \u201cI smell the reds here who have been causing all the trouble.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded. Then as the door lock clicked open, he hesitated.</p><p>He envisioned North or his men holding guns on him and firing as soon as he opened the door. Or standing as wolves, ready to lunge and rip their throats out. This was their territory, and Ryan, Sam, and Tom were the intruders, no matter how they justified being here.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work with you to cure this curse you cast upon all of us,\u201d Ryan said, his voice softly threatening, play the game or die, \u201cand you can live. Your females and your pups need to live with a pack. One that offers more than what you have here\u2014filth and no protection. Hell, the place ought to be condemned. But more than that, if you want to be human again...\u201d Ryan let them draw their own conclusions.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t where we normally live!\u201d a male shouted from inside the room, his voice angry but shaky, too.</p><p>Ryan suspected he was holding a gun.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m armed. And I know how to use the gun,\u201d Ryan warned, in case this was the guy who\u2019d shot him, via a ricocheted bullet off a tree.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cGive it up, and you\u2019ll live. Right now, you don\u2019t have any other alternative. Do you?\u201d</p><p>A low growl emitted from the room. Either the man had shifted, or...</p><p>\u201cHell, North. He\u2019s right. Your cousin\u2019s most likely dead. My sister\u2019s ready to have her kids any minute. Sascha and her pups need to be in a thriving pack with decent leadership. No offense, but this isn\u2019t the life any of us would have chosen,\u201d the man in the room said.</p><p>\u201cNorth, we need to know where the lab is,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a vaccine, develop an antidote, and take care of your people. If Lelandi\u2019s uncle is agreeable, you can join his red pack south of here.\u201d</p><p>Another low growl. North wasn\u2019t going for it.</p><p>\u201cHell, North, that weasel of a scientist, Miller, is holding all of us hostage with this virus,\u201d the man in the room said. \u201cOnce he learns of our bank account holdings, he\u2019ll clean us all out. You know he will.\u201d</p><p>Ryan waited. Sam looked like he was done waiting, his fists and teeth clenched. \u201cWant me to shift?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Tom\u2019s ears were perked, his tail straight out, his posture showing his eagerness to enter the room and take care of business.</p><p>\u201cAgreed, North?\u201d Ryan asked. \u201cConnor is dead. Darien was protecting his mate. Either you help us to help you, or you clear out of the area for good and figure it out for yourselves while we find the solution for our people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, North. I can\u2019t hold out much longer without shifting. Maybe through the night. Maybe not that long. Then I\u2019ll shift, and all that\u2019s left of us is my brother, Galahad,\u201d the man said. \u201cWho knows how long he\u2019ll last.\u201d</p><p>Ryan didn\u2019t wait any further. \u201cSam, call Jake, with the location, the number of wolves, who\u2019s left in the pack\u2014\u201d</p><p>Someone yelled from in back of the house.</p><p>\u201cGalahad!\u201d the guy in the room shouted. \u201cDeal\u2019s off if that wolf kills him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wolf won\u2019t injure Galahad if he doesn\u2019t fight back.\u201d Hell, what was going on now? Then a sickening notion swamped Ryan. If the wolf was Doc Mitchell, he\u2019d left Carol unprotected.</p><p>Hating the wait and not knowing what was going on in the house, Carol clenched and unclenched her hands, watching the front door, the windows... the windows. She saw movement in one of them. A gray wolf. The smaller head indicated a female. She looked like she needed help and implored Carol to come to her. And then she disappeared beneath the window.</p><p>Was it a trick? Was Carol na\u00efve to think the wolf needed her help?</p><p>She stayed put, waiting and observing the window. The wolf didn\u2019t appear again, and Carol couldn\u2019t stand the wait any longer. She wouldn\u2019t go in the house, just peek through the window.</p><p>After a few minutes, she\u2019d traversed the yard, reached the house, and peered in. A mother wolf nursed her pups, and another due to have hers any day now was sitting nearby. Sucking in her breath, Carol turned to look at the front door, still open. The door to the room was shut, and the she-wolves were confined. She was a nurse. She could aid them if they needed her help.</p><p>The she-wolves saw her, eyes widening. The one with the nursing pups remained relaxed on the floor. The other was panting hard. Was she going into labor?</p><p>She needed someone to be with her.</p><p>Carol walked carefully to the front door, not making a sound. Then she peered inside. Nothing\u2014no voices, no footfalls, silent as a ghost house.</p><p>She stepped inside the house and listened again. One of the she-wolves whimpered. The mournful sound of her voice spurred Carol to action. She hurried to the room and gingerly opened the door. The she-wolf that was heavy with pups rushed toward her, and Carol had the sinking feeling she\u2019d just made one of the biggest mistakes of her life.</p><p>Ryan shoved the door to the cramped bedroom open as the man climbed out the window, and North jumped through the same opening in his wolf form. Ryan and Sam raced to the window as Tom ran beside them. A hundred yards from the house, Doc Mitchell had pinned Galahad to the ground. The man\u2019s hands held onto the scruff of the wolf\u2019s neck. Galahad\u2019s eyes widened in terror as Doc pulled his lips back in a snarl and exposed his sharp teeth even more.</p><p>\u201cDoc won\u2019t hurt him, but this ends now. Drop the gun,\u201d Ryan ordered Galahad\u2019s brother.</p><p>As a wolf, Tom leapt through the open window, joining Ryan and eyeing North, who couldn\u2019t seem able to decide what to do. The two reds found themselves facing a bigger gray wolf and Doc Mitchell, too, as he moved off Galahad and positioned himself to attack North. The other man finally seemed resigned and dropped his gun in the tall grass.</p><p>Something moved behind them, and Ryan whipped around to see Carol walking toward them, on the phone and with the very pregnant wolf and the nursing mother and her pups.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine, Lelandi, once we find the lab. Can your uncle take in some wayward reds? They have a couple of females, one with pups and another soon to have a litter. We need to have them transported to the vet clinic.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shook his head at Carol. He didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever mind him while he was trying to do his duty as her protector.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to sitting in the truck and waiting for us?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTwo females needed my help. I never decline helping those who need it, you know. The female\u2019s ready to have her pups. We need to get them to some place clean and safe.\u201d</p><p>Galahad rose from the ground, and Doc Mitchell eyed him warily. Galahad turned to his brother with a look of regret.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over, Hank. It was a harebrained scheme to begin with.\u201d</p> <p>He spoke to Ryan. \u201cThe scientist\u2019s name is Miller Redford, a red wolf who was turned a decade ago and joined our pack a year ago. He gives the impression he\u2019s a mad scientist, but he\u2019s very sane.\u201d</p><p>Sam grunted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s debatable, considering what his meddling could cost our kind,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the basement,\u201d Galahad replied, motioning to the house.</p><p>\u201cHell. Everyone stay put.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan headed for the open bedroom window, ready to end this now.</p><p>Ryan held his gun at the ready as he located a door off the kitchen that he\u2019d assumed was a pantry. Without bothering with the light switch, he moved in the dark down the creaking stairs to the basement, where the walls smelled slightly moldy.</p><p>Light came from around the edges of a door, but when Ryan reached it, he found it locked. The blood thundering in his ears, he holstered his gun and used his lock picks. Once he heard the soft click, he put away his lock picks, pulled his gun out, steeled himself for trouble, and then twisted the door handle.</p><p>He expected to face a man armed with a syringe or a gun, but instead he saw a room exactly as Carol had described to him from the earlier vision. The wide-screen TV hanging on the wall was dark. Sconces hung on the walls and shot soft light upward toward the ceiling, showing off the gold walls. Leather chairs were companions to a leather sofa, and all were brand new, their leather fragrance permeating the air. Brown carpeting smelled new, too. No moldy odor down here, and the paint was fresh.</p><p>If he\u2019d had any doubts about Carol\u2019s psychic talents, this was proof she had them. The analytical part of his brain still fought with him, reminding him that she might have been here once before. But he shoved the notion aside. The chances she would ever have been here were miniscule at best. She truly was psychic.</p><p>A door off the living area was shut, and soft country western music played overhead. Ryan moved quickly across the carpeted floor. He twisted the handle. No resistance. Miller wasn\u2019t expecting the troops. Or he was just plain crazy, despite what Hank had said.</p> <p>Slowly, Ryan opened the door. Definitely a lab with tables and a couple of stools, a microscope, beakers, some jars filled with liquids, and others filled with powdery substances, as well as all-white, sterile-looking cabinets. The smell of disinfectant lingered in the air.</p><p>Something clinked in an adjoining room, and Ryan rushed through the open doorway. This room was smaller, set up like an office with books on shelves against one wall, a neat desk with all the papers stacked in a tray, and a toilet visible in another small room off this one. Next to a fridge, a coffeemaker, coffee mugs, and a microwave oven sat on a counter, and the aroma of cinnamon rolls permeated the air.</p><p>Miller hovered over the coffee pot, pouring himself a cup. He wore a lab coat, black pants, and brown slippers. He was a husky man, a little over six feet tall and much taller than most reds.</p><p>Ryan had hoped he\u2019d catch Miller off guard. And he had, but only for an instant. Miller whipped around, his bearded jaw dropping, his yellow eyes narrowed, and blond hair sweeping his shoulders. Miller threw the hot cup of coffee at Ryan, yanked off his lab coat to reveal his bare chest, and then kicked off his slippers and jerked off his pants.</p><p>Ignoring the burning-hot coffee soaking his shirt and chest, Ryan fired two rounds as Miller shifted and lunged at him. The bullets both struck the wolf\u2019s chest, but because of his hefty size and the shot of adrenaline that had to be running through his system, the hits didn\u2019t stop him for long.</p><p>Ryan holstered his gun and yanked off his clothes as quickly as he could, but Miller knocked him to the tile floor before he could shift. Miller growled, his teeth bared.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dead man...\u201d Ryan said with authority\u2014 although the wolf bearing down on his chest made his breathing labored\u2014as he gripped Miller\u2019s neck with every ounce of strength he possessed \u201c...unless you give us the vaccine.\u201d</p><p>Considering the fate they all faced, Ryan was sure Miller wouldn\u2019t be allowed to live. He was too dangerous\u2014and he knew it. Then again, Ryan was at a distinct disadvantage, and he imagined Miller must be laughing at his boastful threats.</p> <p>Someone rushed through the living area at a gallop, and Ryan assumed either Tom or Doc Mitchell was coming to his rescue. When he saw Carol as a wolf, Ryan\u2019s heart did a flip.</p><p>Miller turned to face the snarling, growling female wolf that was Ryan\u2019s mate, and as he did, Ryan tried to shove him off. Unsuccessfully.</p><p>Miller stayed where he was, his hefty size pinning Ryan down, but his attention remained focused on Carol.</p><p>She snapped at his flank with her wicked teeth, and he moved out of her way, still trying to keep Ryan\u2014the greater threat once he shifted\u2014pinned to the floor.</p><p>She moved behind Miller and bit his stiff tail. He yelped and Ryan\u2019s heart raced, but he still couldn\u2019t get out from underneath the big wolf.</p><p>She lunged at Miller\u2019s backside, like a small fish poking at a shark, and nipped his rump.</p><p>Again, he yelped, but this time he turned to retaliate.</p><p>Unencumbered, Ryan shifted. His natural instinct was to growl and draw Miller\u2019s attention, to let him know he had real trouble in the form of an alpha male gray and give him a fighting chance, but he couldn\u2019t risk Miller tearing into Carol. The red who had changed her had torn into her once. Ryan couldn\u2019t have her traumatized all over again.</p><p>He leapt at Miller\u2019s back as Miller railroaded Carol into a corner of the office between a file cabinet and a chair. Her teeth bared, she growled, her eyes narrowed into slits, the blue color when she was human transformed into rich dark amber. She was beautiful and threatening.</p><p>Ryan grabbed Miller on the back of the neck, crushing his spine with one bite, and regretting it as soon as the wolf collapsed. What if he\u2019d hidden the vaccine? What if they couldn\u2019t discover a cure? How would they survive?</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>A WEEK AND A HALF AFTER RYAN HAD KILLED MILLER, Carol sat at the kitchen table in Doc Weber\u2019s rental home, tapping her bare foot on the floor and reading through books written over the ages that discussed various herbal and other home remedies for getting rid of viruses or colds or werewolfism. She wasn\u2019t any closer to finding a cure for the pack.</p><p>Darkness had descended on the house hours earlier, so fluorescent bulbs flooded the kitchen with light. Ryan was still annoyed with her for having come to his rescue in Miller\u2019s basement. But as soon as she\u2019d realized that her vision of the room involving gunfire was the same place Ryan was investigating, she\u2019d had to rescue him. She just hadn\u2019t realized he was the one doing the shooting and not Miller.</p><p>Tom and Sam still weren\u2019t talking to her, both mad that she\u2019d taken off and nearly gotten herself killed. But she had been the only one not standing guard against the other red males! Besides, wasn\u2019t that what mates did for each other?</p><p>She took a deep breath and continued to study one of the books, while Ryan examined papers spread all over the other end of the golden-oak table. He was looking for a clue to where Miller might have hidden a vaccine.</p><p>On a whim, Lelandi had mentioned that Doc Weber had a personal library that he\u2019d accumulated before he\u2019d had much medical training. A lot of his remedies had been passed down from their ancestors. Carol figured that trying those remedies on the sickened wolves was worth a shot, since nothing else seemed to work. For days, she\u2019d been studying the books and testing the remedies on any willing participant.</p><p>If a person didn\u2019t die from complications of the flu, which thankfully no one had, he or she would eventually get better. But for the lupus garous, the real problem was being able to shift into wolf form and then not being able to shift back. She was trying herbal remedies for lessening the effects of the flu and supposed cures for shifting, if any of them seemed in the least bit sound. Piercing a werewolf\u2019s hands with nails and striking a werewolf in the head with a knife were supposed remedies for getting rid of the werewolf problem but she would leave them to myths and legends.</p><p>She rose from the table, crossed the linoleum floor, and opened the black fridge door. Inside, a bowl of diced onions sat in a thick, golden syrup of honey. She shuddered at the thought of anyone having to eat it.</p><p>A warm hand swept down her back, and she turned slightly to see Ryan looking down at her. His dark amber gaze was tender, and she knew that look in his eyes. It said she had been working at this for too long and she needed to sleep.</p><p>\u201cIn a little while,\u201d she said.</p><p>He took a deep breath and nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower. Join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, but she could tell he didn\u2019t believe her. She wanted to shower with him and enjoy what would happen between them if she did, but he probably assumed she\u2019d never make it to the shower before he was finished.</p><p>\u201cIn a little while,\u201d she said again, trying to reassure him.</p><p>He kissed her forehead, let out his breath, and headed for the guest bathroom.</p><p>Carol closed the fridge door and turned on the teakettle. More of Darien\u2019s pack had shifted to their wolf forms, including Jake, and none could revert to their human forms. Tom and Sam were still fine. And Lelandi had said she had no urges to shift, so was all right for now. Silva had been fighting the shift for a couple of days.</p><p>Those who hadn\u2019t shifted were taking care of those who had. Everyone who was left was short-tempered, feeling the tension, and worried about shifting and about family members who were stuck in their wolf forms.</p><p>A small tickle in Carol\u2019s throat had bothered her for the last hour or so, but it was probably just allergies. She prayed. She also felt a little warmer than usual, which she hoped only meant that the heater was on too high.</p><p>She thought of Nurse Matthew and Charlotte handling the patient load at the hospital while she wasn\u2019t doing her fair share. Sure, she was trying to find an antidote, but it seemed too much like being on holiday. Except that she was worried sick she wouldn\u2019t discover a way to stop the virus. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Doc Weber and Doc Mitchell remained at the hospital in their wolf forms. They urged Carol to use her experimental cures on them. Those ranged from herbal remedies like garlic and onion, Echinacea, licorice\u2014 which didn\u2019t go over with any of the wolves\u2014and Vitamin C for improved antibodies to fight the virus in an infected person. She had even tested the medieval concept that exercising the werewolf into exhaustion in his wolf form would force him to shift back to his human form. Nothing worked. Darien also had tried all of the remedies in good spirit, although he wouldn\u2019t go along with the brutal exercise plan, probably figuring that was a bunch of medieval bunk.</p><p>Carol lifted two packages of licorice, one red and one black, and took a deep breath as she pondered the results of yet another attempt at creating a cure. She\u2019d tested Darien, Jake, and both the vet and Doc Weber, but no one seemed to respond to the home remedies. The vet and Jake had both gone along with the exercise program, willing to try anything to snap out of the inability to shift back to their human form. But Darien was right. It didn\u2019t work.</p><p>Her mind frazzled, she poured herself another cup of ginger tea, and took it back to the table. On page fifty-five of a set of handwritten notes on werewolf myths and legends, she had found a possible cure, or death. She closed her eyes as she sat at the table and rested her head on her arm, willing herself to think. Think, what hadn\u2019t she tried that might work? Something that wouldn\u2019t possibly result in death.</p> <p>Her thoughts shut down, and as if in a dream or out of the mist of her mind, a lush green meadow appeared.</p><p>The sun was shining down on Ryan as he lay on the grass. Hands behind his head, he had his eyes closed and his leg cocked, resting peacefully, until two small boys attacked him with childlike exuberance. The boys were identical in size, maybe three years of age, chubby, with dark hair like Ryan\u2019s, and smiles and dimples like his, too. Startled out of his peaceful pose, he laughed and tackled them, tickling them amid giggles and squeals. Twin boys.</p><p>Before she could come to any conclusions about the vision, the fragrance of blended almond, lime, and mandarin soap drifted to her, and she returned to the world at present and turned in her chair. Freshly showered and totally naked, Ryan advanced on her in a strictly lustful predatory manner. Her gaze shifted to the package between his legs. He sure was hung. She might have missed showering with him, but he wasn\u2019t leaving her to stew over the dilemma of finding a cure all night. And she loved him for it.</p><p>She smiled at him, so handsome and caring and hunky, his mouth curving up a little, his eyes taking her in as if she was the most beautiful creature in the world\u2014which as tired as she was, she knew wasn\u2019t possible\u2014and his expression determined, bordering on sinful seduction.</p><p>No matter how frustrated and anxious she\u2019d become with trying to discover a solution, Ryan was always her champion. He told everyone she was getting close to a breakthrough, when no one really knew how long it would take.</p> <p>He encouraged her, adamantly insisting that she could do it, and by doing so, she knew he trusted in her abilities with all his heart. That bolstered her confidence in the face of failure. Pride reflected in his expression every time he talked about her efforts to find a solution. She wasn\u2019t sure if he did so to remind her she could fight this, too, or if he wanted her to know she was fully a werewolf now\u2014just like any of their kind.</p><p>Despite how tired she was, she saw he was ready for some loving. She rose from the chair to recharge her batteries, too.</p><p>\u201cTime to rest,\u201d he said, massaging her shoulders with dreamy strength.</p><p>She knew he meant after they made love.</p><p>\u201cSo soft,\u201d he whispered against her ear, his large capable hands moving down her pale blue cashmere sweater and settling on her breasts, measuring, feeling, circling. Then his lips curved up in a wicked way.</p><p>\u201cHmm, no bra.\u201d</p> <p>The way he said the words in a hushed and seductive voice, and the way he touched her, made her feel naughty and decadent. She swept her hands up his naked biceps\u2014strong, smooth, and tensing with her touch\u2014 and encircled his neck with her arms. She couldn\u2019t press against his length like she wanted, to feel his growing arousal and his desire for her building, not while his thumbs targeted her nipples, stroking and rolling the sensitive nubs between his fingers and stealing her thoughts, her breath, her willpower.</p><p>Already her loins tightened with need and her body quivering with desire\u2014responsive, receptive, needy. She wanted him, wanted the feel of him mating with her, the closeness, the intimacy.</p><p>His mouth crushed hers, his hands moving from her breasts to the bottom edge of her soft sweater. He slid the luxurious fabric upward, his thumbs stroking her skin from her belly over her breasts, stopping to fondle her nipples for a moment in a deliciously sinful way, and then moving up her collarbone to pull the sweater off.</p><p>He dropped it on a chair, and head bent, leaned down to capture a nipple with his mouth, his tongue slick and hot, as it glided over the raised hypersensitive nub. She moaned, felt her knees give, and would have been kneeling before him if he hadn\u2019t slipped his hands down to cup her buttocks and to hold her in place while he had his way with her.</p><p>She felt her bones melt, her blood and skin sizzle with his touch, and briefly worried that she was shape-shifting... until his thigh pushed between her legs, pressed gently upward, and rubbed, giving her a jolt.</p><p>Oh God, she\u2019d never last.</p><p>His heart was pounding as thunderously as hers, despite his slow and measured moves. He recaptured her mouth with his, their breathing heavy and labored. The scent of arousal, hers and his, entwined in a pleasing fragrance, added to the sweet and spicy aroma of the almond, lime, and mandarin soap he\u2019d washed with.</p><p>His fingers tangled in her hair, his eyes dark as midnight, his thigh still pressed between her legs, holding her up and tormenting her. Then he unfastened her jeans button and, after that, the zipper. Once he\u2019d unzipped her jeans and slipped his fingers into her soft curls, he pulled his mouth away from hers, and smiled.</p> <p>\u201cNo panties?\u201d Again his words made her feel wickedly sinful.</p><p>As if he couldn\u2019t last a moment longer, he tugged her jeans down and left them in a puddle of blue denim on the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he said, and lifted her so that she was straddling him. \u201cAnd all mine,\u201d he added, sounding wolfishly possessive.</p><p>No coherent words could come to mind as her legs were spread open to him against his belly, his chest hair mingling with her soft curls, his stomach rubbing against her feminine lips with every step he took. She clung to him as he moved fast, heading toward the guestroom, his gait long and decisive.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, too,\u201d she said hoarsely, soliciting a deep-seated chuckle from him.</p><p>When they reached the bed, he didn\u2019t set her down and then join her, like she\u2019d expected. Instead, in one deft move, she was on the mattress and he was still between her legs. He shifted away from her slightly and ran his hand up her inner thigh, teasing her into submission.</p><p>But she would not submit! Her hands swept over his arms and his back, and lower to his buttocks. She squeezed, soliciting a shiver from him. She reached up and raked her hands through his damp hair, while his eyes studied her, lust-filled, desirous, and hungry.</p><p>She pulled him down and licked his shoulder, loved the salty and sweet taste of him freshly showered, all man and wolf, and hers. He groaned, a sound that said she was pushing him over the edge.</p><p>As if he couldn\u2019t wait any longer, he began to stroke her between her legs, dipping a finger inside her and claiming her. He pressed his mouth against hers again, ravenous, passionate, greedy. His tongue danced with hers, their breathing fast paced as her fingers pressed against his lower back, her loins aching for resolution.</p><p>She arched her back, pushing against his fingers, demanding, begging. He stroked harder, relentlessly, watching her expression until she shuddered and fractured into a million wondrous bits of pleasure and gave out a cry.</p><p>Watching Carol come nearly brought him to climax. He dove into her tight sheath, and pushed hard and deep\u2014and deeper still. Her body was flushed and moist, and every inch was delectable, gripping him with ripples of orgasm. Her fingers dug into his buttocks, her desire pronounced in her actions and heady arousal.</p><p>He stretched her and claimed her, merging, melding, and mating with her. Their tongues and lips tasted and teased, and he said her name softly against her mouth just before the final thrust\u2014the eruption\u2014when the heat sizzled between them.</p><p>She gave a tired smile, pulled him close, and held on tight.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d she said.</p><p>He rolled over and cushioned her against his chest.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d was his response.</p><p>After sleeping a few hours, and still feeling the sensual glow that always lingered after making love with Ryan, Carol returned to the kitchen to begin working on the Aconitum cure. The plant also was called monkshood, leopard\u2019s bane, wolf\u2019s bane, and dozens of other aliases. Not only was it touted as an herbal cure for colds and fever, but it also slowed the heart rate and numbed nerve endings to pain.</p><p>However, the roots of the plant were poisonous, and while the mostly deep blue or purple flowers were strikingly beautiful, they could also be deadly. So why did some werewolf lore state that the flower was a cure for being a werewolf? It killed wolves. But wouldn\u2019t it kill the human half also? Still, often legends arose from some truth. What if it would cure what ailed them?</p><p>The dawn was just beginning to appear, the darkness fading as the sun rose. Ryan was again reading through the files on Miller\u2019s computer, which Ryan had brought back to Doc Weber\u2019s house. Ryan\u2019s cell phone rang, and he yanked it off his belt.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Tom?\u201d He glanced at Carol. She assumed it might be good news, but Ryan\u2019s expression was noncommittal as he stalked out of the kitchen to the living room to speak to Tom.</p><p>Carol started boiling the roots of the wolf\u2019s bane in a small stainless-steel pot. When Ryan walked back into the kitchen, she knew he was going on another fact-finding mission. Unfortunately, he\u2019d done so at least once a day, sometimes more, and nothing had ever come of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d quit asking, and he hadn\u2019t offered explanations. The disappointment at not getting any closer to a solution was too much to deal with.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back shortly.\u201d He leaned down and kissed Carol\u2019s cheek, but a new look of worry reflected in his eyes. She rose from her chair and took his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Ryan?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing. Just another lead, as usual. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d He pulled her close and hugged her tight.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem like \u201cnothing.\u201d Knowing him, he was probably afraid to make her more anxious than she already was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going into another wolf fight, are you? Without my help?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, kissed her generously on the mouth, and embraced her warmly.</p><p>\u201cNo more wolf fights for now. And I wouldn\u2019t think of not taking you with me to get me out of hot water if I needed it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLiar,\u201d she said affectionately.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cTruly, no wolf fights. Just another lead.\u201d</p><p>She let out her breath, squeezed him back, and said, \u201cAll right. Bring me the vaccine, and I\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and cupped a breast. \u201cYou will anyway.\u201d He rubbed her back, said his usual, \u201cGood luck,\u201d and headed out of the house.</p><p>If he said he wasn\u2019t going into a wolf fight, she believed him. Only sometimes, the unexpected happened. Something was bothering him, and she wasn\u2019t certain she wanted to know what it was. But she suspected\u2014he was fighting the shift, just like she\u2019d been doing for days now.</p><p>Ryan had been surprised as hell when he discovered that Miller had a bank account and safe deposit box at the Silver Town Bank. That seemed to confirm that Miller was plotting to take over the town. Ryan had wasted no time in getting a court order from the local judge that allowed him access to the safe deposit box. He hoped something in the box would reveal whether a cure of vaccine existed, although it was a long shot, and he didn\u2019t want to give Carol any more false hopes.</p> <p>She was aware that something more than usual was bothering him. The real dilemma was his need to shape-shift, which had been growing since the night before. He\u2019d never worried about shifting, but as more of Darien\u2019s people were affected, his own concern had grown.</p><p>Not only that, but he\u2019d noticed that Carol\u2019s body temperature had been warmer the previous night, and he thought she\u2019d been running a low-grade fever. Although she hadn\u2019t mentioned anything to him about it. Even he had a sore throat this morning. He wondered if the virus was geared to push their wolf half into taking over once they were at some stage of being sick.</p><p>Thankfully, humans in the area were no longer shooting wolves. Darien\u2019s stiff policy of jail sentences, hefty fines, and rescinded hunting licenses had been enough of a deterrent. Also, those who had shape-shifted into wolves were trying to stay close to their homes in the woods. Those who lived in town had been taken in by families living out of town to try to reduce the problem of human-wolf contact.</p><p>Ryan drove to the bank, parked, and stalked inside where Mason, the bank owner, quickly greeted him. Mason took him to the bank vault, where the safety deposit boxes were located behind a cage door.</p><p>Wearing one of his expensive gray suits, the gray-bearded banker led Ryan inside the vault. \u201cI\u2019d wring Miller\u2019s thick neck if you hadn\u2019t already killed him,\u201d the banker told Ryan.</p><p>\u201cI wish we could have kept him alive, at least until we learned if he had a vaccine or not,\u201d Ryan replied.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, it couldn\u2019t have been helped.\u201d Mason unlocked the metal box with its two keys and let Ryan open it. He scoured over the documents, receipts for medical supplies, rubber-banded bundles of one-thousand-dollar bills, and...</p><p>Ryan pulled a deed for a house in Silver Town out of the box. \u201cHell, apparently Miller had set up housekeeping here only a month after the big fight between Darien\u2019s people and the reds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned. No one ever thought to see if he\u2019d purchased real estate here. Now what?\u201d Mason asked, stroking his beard.</p><p>\u201cTime to pay a call at his house at 150 Oak Drive. Thanks, Mason. I\u2019ll let you know if I find anything.\u201d</p><p>As Ryan headed out of the bank to his truck, he called Tom with a heads-up and then drove over to Miller\u2019s home. It was a modest place with black shutters framing two large windows and massive oaks shading the grass. The lawn was a little shaggy, probably because Miller had been dead for ten days and a warming trend and spring rain had encouraged the growth.</p><p>Sheriff Peter Jorgenson drove into the drive, and Ryan gave him a silent nod of greeting. He\u2019d planned to use his lock picks, although he supposed that some of the neighbors might be human and having a police officer on hand would be better. The sheriff was better yet.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Ryan said as the sheriff climbed out of his vehicle.</p><p>\u201cRyan. Tom called and said to meet you here. Think this is where the gold is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure as hell hope so.\u201d</p><p>Peter stifled a cough.</p><p>\u201cYou, too, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah. I don\u2019t think any of us are going to escape it.\u201d</p><p>Deputy Trevor drove up, lights flashing. He waved and joined them as Peter unlocked the door.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe the bastard was living among us?\u201d Trevor said, punching his fist into the palm of his hand.</p><p>\u201cThe guy had balls. I\u2019ll give him that,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>When they entered the house, the smell of fresh paint assaulted them. New carpeting covered the floors, but the place was empty. No drapes over windows covered in mini-blinds. No furniture.</p><p>\u201cNot moved in yet, looks like,\u201d Trevor said, sounding thankful, as though just the knowledge that Miller hadn\u2019t been living under their noses all along was a relief.</p><p>But the knowledge that Miller hadn\u2019t moved in ratcheted up Ryan\u2019s anxiety a notch. If Miller hadn\u2019t been here, he most likely wouldn\u2019t have left anything here. Still, they had to make sure.</p><p>While Trevor checked the bedrooms and bathroom down the hall, Ryan and Peter stalked toward the kitchen.</p><p>Everything looked brand new\u2014appliances, cabinets, black granite countertop\u2014despite the home being an older model.</p><p>\u201cHe was getting ready to move in, I suspect,\u201d Peter said, searching through the drawers and cabinets.</p><p>\u201cYeah, probably just waiting for us all to be infected and unable to shift back. Wonder what he would have done about the wolf half of us. Not many of us would have let him live if he\u2019d ventured out of his house.\u201d</p><p>Ryan noticed that the fridge was running. He pulled open the fridge door. Through the glass top of one of the drawers, he spied several vials of liquid and packages of powder in a manila envelope.</p><p>\u201cMight not be what we\u2019re looking for,\u201d Ryan said, pulling out a vial and looking at it like it was the most volatile thing in the world, \u201c...but then again it might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot damn,\u201d Peter said.</p><p>Ryan opened a piece of paper from the envelope and read the first few lines of scribble. And smiled.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>THE FRONT DOOR TO DOC\u2019S HOUSE OPENED, AND CAROL wondered if Ryan had found anything this time. She immediately straightened her back as she stood at the counter. She was boiling water in an electric teakettle in the process of making anise tea, one more possible herbal remedy for fighting a viral infection.</p><p>Again, she considered the wolf\u2019s bane solution she\u2019d cooked and hidden in the crisper of the fridge. She wouldn\u2019t risk giving that remedy to anyone else. She did consider drinking a bit of it herself, now that she was sick with the flu, to see if it might be a cure.</p><p>She tilted her head in the direction of the footfalls. They were a woman\u2019s, much lighter and delicate than Ryan\u2019s heavier step. She thrust the container of wolf\u2019s bane back in its hiding spot and closed the door.</p><p>Then someone else\u2019s footfalls sounded. Two women? At first, she thought it might be Bertha, bringing her and Ryan a snack as she\u2019d been doing for the past several days, trying to help out in any way that she could, but they\u2019d eaten breakfast an hour earlier.</p><p>Carol turned stiffly to see who was coming. Her skin felt warmer than normal, and she suspected\u2014although she couldn\u2019t find a thermometer in Doc\u2019s house to confirm it\u2014that she had another low-grade fever. She felt tired and out of sorts, her head throbbing, and she was deathly afraid that anytime now she\u2019d shift.</p><p>The only reason she hadn\u2019t yet, she figured, was because she\u2019d shifted to help Ryan fight Miller. Before that, she\u2019d shifted so she could play fishnet tag with North and his men. That might have knocked out the urge for the time being.</p><p>With any luck, maybe she\u2019d find a cure before she felt the compulsion again.</p><p>The footsteps grew closer. Couldn\u2019t be Silva. She was sick and terrified of shifting. She didn\u2019t want to get near Carol and risk contaminating her. Or Nurse Charlotte. She was too busy dealing with patients to come to the house.</p><p>Which left Lelandi and some other women in the pack that Carol didn\u2019t know well. Lelandi had better not be coming here to see her!</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Carol called out, not wanting Lelandi to come any closer, if that\u2019s who it was.</p><p>The footfalls continued through the living room in the direction of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis I, Rosalind,\u201d Ryan\u2019s sister said, her voice bright and cheerful.</p><p>Carol\u2019s mouth dropped. Oh, hell. She didn\u2019t want anyone to lose faith in her ability to find a cure now that she was sick and could be on the verge of shifting at any time, but she didn\u2019t want Rosalind exposed to what she had, either.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t come in,\u201d Carol said, her voice firm.</p><p>\u201cLelandi said it was all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLelandi\u2019s wrong.\u201d Carol frowned. \u201cWho\u2019s with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLelandi,\u201d Darien\u2019s mate said, sounding amused.</p><p>\u201cLelandi, you shouldn\u2019t be here. Neither of you should. I... I\u2019m sick.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were nearly to the kitchen. Carol turned off the teakettle, but she didn\u2019t know what else to do. It hurt to stand or sit or even lie down. Her joints all ached. Her throat was sore. She felt miserable.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come in,\u201d she warned.</p><p>Lelandi and Rosalind ignored her and entered the kitchen, each carrying a brass container of red roses. Rosalind was wearing a pale pink sweater and matching jeans. Her curly, long brown hair bounced on her shoulders, and her amber eyes sparkled with excitement. Her smile was sweeter than Ryan\u2019s and not as devious as his often was.</p><p>Her red hair tied back in a bun, Lelandi wore a loosely fitted emerald sweatshirt and sweatpants. Carol wondered if Lelandi\u2019s jeans were getting a little too snug around her waist with triplets on the way. Lelandi gave her a knowing smile.</p> <p>\u201cRyan has good news. But you\u2019ve beat him at the game again.\u201d</p><p>Carol slumped on the chair, feeling lightheaded. Tears blurred her eyes. Even if Ryan had found the vaccine, it would only protect werewolves from getting the virus, not cure those who had it already.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Rosalind? You shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Carol said, defeated though hopeful that Ryan did find the vaccine and that it would help those who weren\u2019t sick.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand being in Green Valley and not knowing how this was all going down. Lelandi told me you were looking into herbal remedies. I have a greenhouse and wanted to bring all kinds of fresh herbs for you to use in your search for the cure.\u201d</p><p>Carol sighed. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come. What if you get sick, too?\u201d Then she frowned and looked at Lelandi. \u201cIf Ryan found the vaccine, how would I have beaten him at the game?\u201d</p> <p>Lelandi beamed, then crossed the floor, pulled Carol from the chair into her embrace, and hugged her soundly. Carol wanted to break loose and dash away from her. But Carol didn\u2019t have the strength. Was Lelandi mad?</p><p>Rosalind waited, but the way she was standing so rigidly and grinning from ear to ear, Carol wondered if it was because she knew for sure Ryan and she were mated. But that would all be for nothing if she didn\u2019t find a cure!</p><p>\u201cDarien shifted a few minutes ago,\u201d Lelandi said, tears misting her eyes. \u201cGod, Carol, you did it. That first remedy you tried\u2014the one he balked at and I had to force him to drink? The spicy ginger tea? Combined with the raw onion chunks left soaking in honey overnight that he growled at me over, and the Echinacea... all of the different remedies together worked. It just took a while, but... he\u2019s back to his usual self. Well, a little gruffer than usual. He would have come down here personally and thanked you...\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed down Carol\u2019s cheeks like a river run amok. She couldn\u2019t grasp the ramifications of what she\u2019d done, and she wasn\u2019t sure she could accept it. What if they turned back? What if this didn\u2019t last?</p><p>Rosalind joined them. \u201cRyan found a jewel when he fell in love with you,\u201d she said, and tugged Carol into a hug. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted a sister who could beat him in something.\u201d</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t a game. She embraced Rosalind back, pleased to have another sister to add to her family in any event. She reached over and drew Lelandi into an all-girls\u2019 hug.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure, Lelandi?\u201d</p><p>Tears streaked down Lelandi\u2019s cheeks now, too, and she nodded vigorously.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell yeah. He\u2019s giving orders, yelling at Tom for allowing you to let North into the exam room and nearly taking off with you; giving Jake grief for shape-shifting and getting stuck, even though he knew it couldn\u2019t be helped; and scolding me for allowing you to mate with Ryan without letting him know first.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll miss you, Carol. Will you be all right when Ryan takes you home to his pack?\u201d</p><p>Rosalind took Carol\u2019s hand and squeezed. \u201cSilver Town\u2019s not that far from Green Valley. She\u2019ll visit. We both will, if it\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the all-girl-night parties,\u201d Carol said, trying to smile.</p><p>Rosalind gave Carol another hug. \u201cSounds like those could get out of hand, and I\u2019m in. After you and Ryan are all right and no one from our pack will get sick with this...\u201d She grinned even more broadly. \u201c...You can come home. Don\u2019t tell Ryan, but I\u2019m moving to a condo in town, closer to my garden shop. The house will be yours and Ryan\u2019s. He\u2019ll say no, because he wants to keep an eye on me, but I need a little freedom, and... well, this is going to be perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDarien is so proud of you,\u201d Lelandi said. \u201cSo very proud of you. He\u2019ll tell you himself after he finishes ordering everyone around. At least those who haven\u2019t shifted yet.\u201d She motioned to the doorway. \u201cRyan ran the vaccine to the hospital, and Charlotte and Matthew will be giving vaccinations to anyone who isn\u2019t sick. Rosalind and I were already vaccinated.</p><p>\u201cDoc also shifted back\u2014we suspect maybe even earlier than Darien. We didn\u2019t know it until just a few minutes ago because he was so tired that he slept through the whole thing. He\u2019ll help with the vaccinations and wants to tell Ryan to join our pack and forget taking you away.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Darien would say no to that. It\u2019s one thing for Ryan to come here to help us out with an important matter. But it\u2019s another for Darien to have to butt heads with him all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d Ryan called as he entered the house. \u201cHave I got good news! We found the vaccine.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Lelandi and Carol wiped away residual tears as the women all waited for Ryan to enter the kitchen.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s smile faltered when he saw Rosalind and Lelandi with their arms around Carol\u2019s waist. \u201cI got waylaid at the hospital and thought the two of you had gone home,\u201d he said to Lelandi.</p><p>\u201cWe were on our way there when Darien called Lelandi with the news. Carol found the cure,\u201d Rosalind said, proudly. \u201cSo we had to tell her right away. Once you and she are cured and ready to come home... well, everything will be right with the world.\u201d</p><p>He looked from Rosalind to Lelandi. She shrugged. \u201cDarien\u2019s raising Cain with everyone\u2014North and his pack members; the two gray females, Becky and Marilee, for their shenanigans; and Tom for allowing North to nearly take off with Carol at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shifted back.\u201d Ryan smiled with a bit of the devil in his expression. \u201cHe\u2019s mad at me for taking Carol as my mate without his permission, I can just bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, but he\u2019ll speak with you after he makes sure Carol\u2019s cure has lasting power.\u201d</p><p>Ryan chuckled darkly. \u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc Mitchell hasn\u2019t changed back yet, and he\u2019s having fits over it. Doc Weber said the two of you can stay in his home as long as you like. He\u2019ll stay with Doc Mitchell in his big, old house in the country until the vet shifts back.\u201d</p><p>Carol felt relief and exhaustion, knowing that she no longer had to push herself to find a cure and that Ryan wouldn\u2019t have to keep looking for a vaccine. She slumped down on the kitchen chair and wanted to sleep for the next year without waking to do anything.</p><p>Ryan saw the telltale signs that Carol was truly sick. He assumed she\u2019d been trying to hide it from him earlier. Now he saw how her eyelids drooped, her eyes glassy and her face pale. She looked worn out and sick. Like he felt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the cure?\u201d he asked, ready to give it to Carol first.</p><p>She motioned to the fridge, teakettle, and herbs and spices sitting in containers on the counter. \u201cA half-dozen remedies together. But I\u2019ve detailed everything in my notes on the computer.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the packages of licorice sitting on the countertop. \u201cNot the licorice.\u201d He frowned at her. \u201cOr the onion soaked all night in honey, surely.\u201d</p><p>She smiled a little and reached for his hand. \u201cAt least we don\u2019t have to try wolf\u2019s bane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolf\u2019s bane?\u201d Rosalind and Lelandi said at the same time.</p><p>Carol shrugged. \u201cIt could have killed us. I need to throw that remedy out before anyone drinks it by accident.\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked at her as if she\u2019d lost her mind.</p><p>\u201cOr it could have been a cure, according to werewolf lore. It was used for medicinal purposes eons ago. And as a poison.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi asked, \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bottom-right crisper in the fridge, blue container.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind went to dispose of it.</p><p>\u201cUntil we can move to Green Valley, Carol and I will stay here,\u201d Ryan said, damned thankful they hadn\u2019t had to try wolf\u2019s bane. He hated the taste of licorice, and the idea of onions soaked in honey was sure to turn him off eating either for months.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Puss?\u201d Carol asked, and sneezed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Puss should stay with us a while longer while you get your rest,\u201d Lelandi suggested.</p><p>Carol nodded. The fight was out of her. She needed to rest.</p><p>Ryan gathered her up into his arms, feeling how warm her body was and knowing she was running a fever.</p><p>\u201cNo one is to disturb us... for anything.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind grinned. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day that my brother would be mated.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi patted Ryan\u2019s back as he headed for the guest bedroom. \u201cTake good care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be good as new before you know it.\u201d</p><p>But Carol wasn\u2019t good as new in short order. She was run down, stressed to the max, and totally worn out. She lost her voice, coughed constantly, ran fevers, and ached all over. Ryan, who wasn\u2019t nearly as sick, was still feeling poorly. He had to watch the way he coughed and grimaced every time he swallowed. Yet he took care of Carol as if he were her personal nurse, bossy sometimes and coaxing at other times.</p><p>He brought her fresh boxes of tissues and glasses of water and orange juice and sore throat lozenges and expectorant medicines. He forced down pots of ginger tea, onions minus honey, honey on toast\u2014hopefully with the same benefit, small doses of licorice, and garlic. He tried all the remedies she\u2019d used with Darien and the others who had contracted the virus, except for the exercise routine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Three times the previous night, she\u2019d had the damnable urge to shift, and the heat had again struck her. Three times, Ryan had made love to her, and to her amazement and joy, he\u2019d coaxed the urge to shift right out of her. If she\u2019d known that hot sex would keep the shift from occurring, she would have dragged him from the woods the first night she\u2019d seen him and sneaked him into the guest bedroom to ply his erotic moves on her.</p><p>Now it was daylight, and the heat once again infiltrated her muscles and joints\u2014and even her bones. She hadn\u2019t had a fever in two days, so she knew the heat wasn\u2019t due to that. This went deeper. When she tugged at the covers in a frantic way and then tried to pull off her long T-shirt, Ryan noticed her distress. He left the chair he\u2019d been sitting in while he watched over her and sat on the edge of the bed, his hand caressing her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you about the time my partner drove after an armed robber on foot, and the robber dove over a fence into someone\u2019s backyard?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. She loved how he could lessen her compulsion to shift by telling her tales of his exploits as a police officer first and then as a P.I. But she was afraid the effect wouldn\u2019t last forever, and she feared that the antidote wouldn\u2019t kick in soon enough.</p><p>\u201cMy partner didn\u2019t apply the brakes in time. The fence was hiding not only the robber but also an attractive nuisance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA swimming pool,\u201d she guessed, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYep. I was in foot pursuit. Instead of trying to catch the robber, I ended up having to rescue my partner from the swimming pool as his car plummeted into the heated water.\u201d</p><p>Carol smiled. Ryan gave her an elusive smile back and kissed her forehead.</p> <p>\u201cDid the robber get away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was so stunned that he was still gawking at the rescue as I pulled my partner free. By the time the robber thought to make a hasty retreat, I\u2019d tackled him. He ended up in handcuffs\u2014and soaking wet, too.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled, loving to hear about her mate\u2019s past and growing closer to him every day. She hoped and prayed and wished she\u2019d be back to normal soon. Then he\u2019d take her home\u2014to his home, his pack, and his family. She hated leaving her job behind. Yet until she could get her shifting under control, she doubted she could handle work.</p><p>The urge to shift gone, she tugged down her T-shirt, and Ryan covered her back up with the blanket.</p><p>\u201cSleep, my Florence Nightingale.\u201d He ran the back of his hand across her cheek in a gentle caress. \u201cSleep, and we\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>When she woke again, she felt much better, not having coughed all night long. Her throat was no longer scratchy, and her energy was back, but Ryan wasn\u2019t in the bedroom. Was he bringing her lunch or dinner or breakfast, depending on the hour?</p> <p>For once, she felt famished. What was the hour? She glanced at the clock. One in the afternoon. She closed her eyes, uncertain what day it was. Had the phase of the new moon begun? Would the lupus garous be back to normal?</p><p>Carol crawled out of bed, stared at her translucent nightgown, and wondered when she\u2019d put that on. She pulled it off, dumped it on the bed, and took a long, hot shower, while speculating how everyone else was faring. Had the vaccine worked and kept the last of their kind from falling prey to the bioengineered virus? Had the cure taken effect for everyone? Were Doc Mitchell and Jake back to their normal selves? Time to rejoin the world and find out what was going on.</p><p>She towel dried herself, wrapped the towel around her hair, walked out of the bathroom\u2014and froze.</p><p>Ryan stood in the room with a bouquet of cheery pink roses in one hand and her cat cradled in his other arm. Almost smiling, Puss looked like he had a new pal.</p><p>Her heart did a little flip. Ryan had brought her flowers. She didn\u2019t realize how much that would mean to her. But it meant the world.</p><p>And Puss. She wanted to take him in her arms and squeeze him tightly.</p><p>Ryan smiled brightly at Carol. \u201cI like what you\u2019ve done with your hair, and\u201d\u2014he waved the flowers at her nude body\u2014\u201cthe rest of you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten all about that. Knowing just what he had in mind, she chuckled. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m returning to bed after I\u2019ve been in it for days now, you\u2019ve got another think coming.\u201d</p> <p>Part of her wanted him to change her mind, but the more sensible side of her said it was time to get to work doing something other than going back to bed. She stalked toward the dresser, hoping she had some clothes in it, but Ryan caught her with his free arm and pulled her tight against his body. The tea-scented, velvet rose petals tickled as they brushed her shoulder, and Puss licked her arm in greeting with his sandpaper tongue.</p><p>\u201cWhile you were in the shower, I changed the sheets. Just in case.\u201d</p><p>He was a dream come true. And how could she deny she wanted to make love with him again? The day could wait. She snuggled against Ryan, and reached up and stroked Puss\u2019s head. His motor instantly began to rumble.</p><p>\u201cIs everyone all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Because of all the strain you\u2019ve been under, you\u2019ve taken the longest to recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d she asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cNearly two weeks. North and his renegade pack members have joined Lelandi\u2019s red pack. If they cause any trouble there, they\u2019ll live to regret it. Becky and Marilee took off once they were well. No one knows where they went and no one cares. A few... well, let\u2019s say more than a few of the bachelor males are pissed I mated you.\u201d</p><p>Carol smiled. \u201cGuess it\u2019s good I\u2019m leaving then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a proposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Sex came to mind, as it often did. But what he said next surprised her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve contracted with a lupus garou doctor to open a clinic in Green Valley. He said he\u2019d try it out and make sure it was the kind of place he\u2019d want to raise a family. He wanted to talk to you about being his nurse. Doc Weber had already told him what an asset you were.</p><p>\u201cUntil you\u2019ve been a werewolf for a year or two and can really get your shape-shifting under control, a clinic run solely by werewolf types would be the best solution. Patients would be strictly werewolves, and our pack will welcome having their own clinic for lupus garou-related problems. One of the clerks at the hospital is in my pack, and she\u2019d be thrilled to work for you as your receptionist and billing clerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>He frowned a little. \u201cWe really need a medical team that can take care of werewolf patients. You could even further your training to become a physician\u2019s assistant, if you wanted. Or a doctor even.\u201d</p><p>She thought it was a wonderful idea, but she still thought he wanted something more... intimate. \u201cHere I thought you were going to proposition me for something else.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and leaned down and kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cHmm, what had you in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your plaid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time, I promise.\u201d He slipped the bouquet of flowers into a vase of fresh water and then set Puss down on a soft cushion on top of a chair. Her cat immediately jumped down, wound his way around Carol\u2019s legs and then Ryan\u2019s, and then ran across the floor and curled up in a window seat.</p><p>Ryan snorted. \u201cHe has a mind of his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be able to show him who\u2019s boss.\u201d She began unbuttoning Ryan\u2019s shirt, slowly, provocatively.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that in the family\u2014that means between you and Rosalind, and now the cat and me\u2014I\u2019ll have a difficult time being in charge.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and pulled his shirt free from his pants. \u201cThat\u2019s as it should be, my Highland hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, you saved me from a mad scientist, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re even then,\u201d she said, unbuckling his belt as he caressed her naked breasts in a loving way. \u201cYou saved me from a fishnet.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to teach you to swim. Have I told you I love you today?\u201d He kissed her nose, pulled off her towel turban and dropped it over the back of a chair.</p><p>\u201cBefore you made love to me, while you were making love to me, and after you made love to me sometime in the middle of the night. Yes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I can\u2019t say it enough.\u201d His thumbs chafed her nipples, as she took hold of his arm and pulled him toward the bed.</p><p>She caressed his chest. \u201cAh, Ryan, I don\u2019t know anything about being a pack leader\u2019s mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t be more perfect.\u201d</p><p>She snorted in a feminine way. \u201cRight. I don\u2019t know how to howl, I can\u2019t swim, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her thoroughly, his tongue stroking hers\u2014 hot, hard, and urgent, his hands making her breasts swollen and tingly, that she forgot what she was about to say. All she knew was they were perfect for each other. She would learn how to control her shape-shifting somehow, how to raise a couple of were-kids, and how to lead a pack with Ryan at her side. One thing she didn\u2019t have to learn was how to love Ryan with all her heart.</p><p>Ryan could lose himself in Carol\u2019s sweet body, her willing mouth softening under his kisses, her nipples rosy and peaked and tantalizing, and the way she moved her body against his, arching and touching and pushing for action. He\u2019d thought she might be sore from all their love-making the night before, but she\u2019d been so eager, and he couldn\u2019t get enough of her once she\u2019d felt better again.</p><p>He\u2019d really thought to give her a break. Flowers, bringing Puss to her, giving her news about a job. He hadn\u2019t expected to find her fresh from the shower with her skin flushed and her hair done up in a turban. She was gorgeous. And she craved having him. Despite the pretense that she didn\u2019t want to return to bed. By the way she sounded so hopeful that he\u2019d want her back in bed\u2014and when would he not desire that?\u2014he knew she was ready for more loving.</p><p>He loved her insecurities and strengths, the way she accepted him for all his foibles, and the way she loved him back. He now knew why he\u2019d been obsessing about her for the past six months.
