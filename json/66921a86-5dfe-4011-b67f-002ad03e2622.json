He looked up to see that they\u2019d pushed the table far enough and stopped with an irritated huff. He turned and grabbed a nearby stool, sat it on the pool table, and climbed up on top of it, cursing as the stool wobbled beneath him. He pushed the access panel in the ceiling experimentally. It didn\u2019t budge. He banged it with the heel of his hand. It rattled but didn\u2019t pop free.</p> <p>\u201cThe one thing in this place that\u2019s built solid,\u201d he muttered as he looked around for something to use. There was nothing. There wasn\u2019t anything but the pool table and a pub table with two stools in the deserted pool hall. It didn\u2019t even have pool cues!</p><p>He grumbled under his breath and punched the access panel, causing it to crack down the middle. With his movement the stool wobbled dangerously beneath his feet, and he threw his hands out to the sides to catch his balance. The stool stopped rocking almost as suddenly as it started, and as Ty glanced down, he saw Zane had grabbed it with both hands to hold it steady.</p><p>\u201cCareful there, Twinkletoes,\u201d Zane said with a half smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ty said to him as he shook his hand. \u201cAbout time you did something useful. Watch your head,\u201d he warned as he shoved at the pieces of the panel, which fell to the pool table below him with a muted clatter. He looked back down at Zane. \u201cCome up here so I can stand on your head,\u201d he said with a slight smile.</p><p>Zane snorted as he hefted himself up onto the table next to the stool. \u201cYou just want me for my body,\u201d he said as he stood up, his shoulders even with Ty\u2019s waist.</p> <p>Ty petted him on the head with one gloved hand, then reached through the nearly foot-thick ceiling, placed his gun on the roof of the building, and gripped the edges to lever himself up. He growled in annoyance as he hung there, almost stuck in the opening due to the bulky body armor hindering his progress. He managed to pull himself through, grunting as he scratched and clawed his way through the opening and crawled out to flatten out on the roof. He yanked the protective helmet from his head and tossed it away, breathing in the crisp air in relief.</p><p>He stuck his head back over the edge and hung his arm down, offering Zane a hand up with a hint of dread. He never knew lately whether Zane would accept help or bite his head off for offering it. The abrupt mood swings and other problems Zane had been having since the Tri-State serial killer case were the reason they were doing jobs like this instead of working back at the Bureau.</p><p>But Zane was apparently still in the good mood he\u2019d exhibited so far, because he took Ty\u2019s arm without comment as he climbed up on the stool to follow him. Just as he pushed off with his long legs, there was a loud bang on the door.</p><p>Ty saw the flimsy door rattle, and he yanked at Zane with everything he could muster while still lying flat on his stomach. \u201cBattering ram,\u201d he warned in a strained voice.</p><p>Zane huffed and pulled himself up with Ty\u2019s help, growling as soon as his feet were through the access hatch. \u201cClear,\u201d he said under his breath. A second later a loud bang echoed in the pool hall underneath them as the door was forced open.</p><p>\u201cMove, move, move,\u201d Ty hissed to Zane as he grabbed his gun and mask and ran for the edge of the building, easily leaping to the next. They needed to be several buildings over before the team that had found them could relay their position.</p> <p>Zane was right behind him. \u201cThree buildings over. Fire escape.\u201d He\u2019d memorized the downtown layout the night before while Ty worked on today\u2019s plans with Benson and the rest of the crew. Of course, those plans were now blown to hell. At least Ty still had the walking map with him.</p><p>They kept low, hurrying along the rooftops until they came to the fire escape Zane had mentioned. Ty glanced over the edge. The only problem, of course, was that the top of the metal stairs didn\u2019t reach the roof. It was an eight-foot drop to the top level from where they were.</p><p>\u201cI hate this fucking town,\u201d Ty grumbled as he secured his gun and glanced over his shoulder. He could hear shouting, the various patrols communicating to each other; they obviously didn\u2019t possess the same sort of gear he and Zane were using to stay in touch with their comrades.</p><p>He looked back down at the fire escape. It was their only way down unless they fancied trying to fly.</p><p>They were almost out of options, and not just because they were stuck on a roof. They\u2019d planned for this contingency, though. There were three two-man teams in town today, each equipped with enough charges to blow one of three targets and radio receivers linked to each set. Bravo team had achieved its objective\u2014blowing up a television station that doubled as the town\u2019s communications center. But in doing so they\u2019d moved too early and announced their presence before Ty and Zane could even reach their own target.</p><p>While Bravo team had done its job, the two men hadn\u2019t survived long enough to celebrate. Alpha team had managed to set its charges at the supply stores at the end of the street, but the men had been assaulted on their way out and hadn\u2019t managed to blow them. They were now involved in a running gunfight through the streets, taking their radio receivers farther and farther out of range as they went. They were screwed, much like Ty and Zane were about to be.</p><p>Ty climbed over the edge of the brick and lowered himself slowly until his feet dangled just a couple feet above the metal platform below, Zane following suit. To jump would have made too much noise, and they couldn\u2019t afford to be captured or killed before they laid their charges. One target out of three was unacceptable. Two targets was still a failure, but it was better than nothing. Ty wanted all three targets, even if he had to do the last two himself.</p><p>They made their way down the fire escape quickly, causing only the occasional clang or bang as they hurried. When Ty\u2019s booted feet hit the pavement, though, a shout from the corner of the building met them.</p> <p>\u201cStop! Federal agents!\u201d the man behind the protective mask warned as he held his gun up.</p><p>Ty turned without a moment\u2019s hesitation and fired at him, two quick shots, and red bloomed across the letters on the man\u2019s chest. He fell back, and Ty and Zane ran toward him rather than away, firing at the other agents who rounded the corner. Before the other two men in the patrol could retreat or call for backup, both took shots in the chest and dropped with pained cries.</p><p>Zane lowered his gun and pulled off his headgear. His dark hair, longer than it used to be and brushing his collar, was ruffled up now, and a curled wire from the ear bud ran along his scruffy cheek. He turned his chin to look at Ty. \u201cWe can still make the objective. This is the right street.\u201d He nodded to the road at the nearby crossing.</p><p>\u201cLead on,\u201d Ty told him as he tossed his protective mask at the agents lying on the ground. He didn\u2019t plan to wear it anymore; if he took one in the face it wouldn\u2019t do him much good anyway, and he couldn\u2019t think with it on.</p><p>Zane\u2019s safety gear hit the ground as well as they loped past the fallen men, and at the end of the alley they flattened against the vinyl siding of that building so Zane could look around the corner.</p><p>The town\u2019s main street was a long, paved corridor lined with shops. Laundromat, barber shop, diner, movie theater, the deserted pool hall they\u2019d fled just a few moments ago, and several other buildings. Some in use, some not. At the very end of the street was the large brick building that served as the area\u2019s supply storage, its front lined with garage doors for freight trucks to drop off provisions. The munitions dump was several stores over on their side of the street, concealed in a computer repair shop. That was their objective.</p><p>Ty knew that the big problem was not the distance they had to travel, but the teams of agents that patrolled the streets. He and Zane had nothing but the charges and receivers, the guns they held in their hands, and their communications gear. And a bottle of hairspray Ty had taken from the drug store down the street when they\u2019d ducked inside to avoid a patrol.</p><p>Their biggest ally now was stealth.</p><p>They made their way to the corner of the block undetected, swiftly coming up on the ammunition cache.</p><p>Shouts came from their right, and then they heard a muffled gunfight. The commotion continued, followed by the pop-pop of the guns and the screams of their team members in their ear buds.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be Alpha team,\u201d Ty said flatly as they continued to move.</p><p>First Bravo team, and now Alpha team was down as well\u2014without completing their mission of blowing up the supply stores at the end of the street. Ty and Zane still had to set their own charges at the munitions dump and blow them, and now they also had to get within range of the storage building to blow Alpha\u2019s charges if they wanted to complete the mission.</p><p>\u201cStupid. They should have blown the charges when they had the chance,\u201d Zane muttered, looking behind them quickly as they made their way to the door of the computer repair shop. He held up three fingers to indicate the number of people Benson\u2019s intel had said would be guarding the ammo dump. Zane stopped beside the door and looked at Ty seriously. \u201cReady?\u201d he asked almost inaudibly.</p><p>Ty nodded as he popped a fresh cartridge into his gun. He looked up at Zane and grinned widely. He fished out the bottle of hairspray he\u2019d pilfered from the drug store up the road as they had dashed through it earlier, shaking it vigorously.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t blow up. Hell, it wouldn\u2019t do anything but roll when he threw it. But it would look enough like a flashbang as it flew through the air to make everyone inside duck. It might give them enough time.</p><p>Zane looked at him incredulously and then rolled his eyes. \u201cChrist,\u201d he muttered. He crouched down next to the door, gun ready. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>Ty stepped up to the door and kicked at it, just below the doorknob where it was weakest. He tossed the hairspray into the room and followed it immediately, firing to his right in a wide spray of bullets.</p><p>Still crouched, Zane shifted inside behind him and fired to the left, taking out an agent caught ducking from the fake flashbang. Zane got to his feet just in time to take a step into the room and be hit from the side by a heavy body.</p><p>Ty turned and watched as Zane hit the floor under the other man\u2019s momentum. Zane pulled up his knees and kept rolling while the agent scrambled, trying to reach for a gun sitting out on the sales counter nearby. Zane\u2019s boot in his gut stopped him, and the man dropped, gasping for breath.</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Ty simply shot the man in the back to stop the oncoming brawl. The agent fell forward without a sound, his eyes still registering shock as he lay on the ground.</p><p>Ty shook his head at him and then looked around the room at the mess they\u2019d made. The walls were running with red. He clucked his tongue and shook his head as he looked around at the bodies littering the floor.</p><p>\u201cComplacent,\u201d he chastised. He went over to the weapons locker, beginning to stuff extra cartridges into his pockets as he whistled. He realized belatedly that the tune was the chorus of \u201cBattle Hymn of the Republic.\u201d He was having more fun than he probably should have been.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they teaching these idiots?\u201d Zane asked as he picked up the extra gun from the sales counter and slid it into his waistband. \u201cNo wonder the Bureau\u2019s going to shit,\u201d he muttered. He joined Ty at the cabinet to pull out cartridges for himself.</p><p>Ty nodded as he hummed. He finished loading up with extra ammo and went to the agent he\u2019d shot in the back, kneeling down beside him. He patted him on the head. \u201cShoot first next time. Tackle later,\u201d he advised, and then he stood and went to the doorway.</p><p>\u201cYou have a really morbid sense of humor, you know that?\u201d Zane said as he stepped over the body while sliding the new cartridge into his gun. \u201cLet me have those charges,\u201d he demanded, holding out his hand.</p><p>Ty gave a careful glance around the door frame, peering down the street. \u201cSet \u2019em quick,\u201d he ordered as he pulled them out and handed them to Zane. He looked out again, looking at the brick building down the road with its open bays and garages. \u201cYou think we\u2019re in range here?\u201d he asked as he fished out the switch that would trigger Alpha Team\u2019s charges and looked at it. He pushed the button, uncaring of the teams of demolitions agents who were swarming the building, trying to defuse the charges. He peered out at the building. Nothing happened. He pushed the button a few more times just in case.</p><p>Zane shook his head while setting the charge inside the stack of boxes. He didn\u2019t even look outside. \u201cStill eighty yards out of range. We have to get to the office building on the corner to be close enough.\u201d He glanced over at Ty. \u201cWould you quit pushing the damn button?\u201d he said in exasperation. \u201cWhat if you break the connection? Then what\u2019re you gonna do? Waltz over there and set it off by hand?\u201d He set the charge frequency and clicked on the receiver.</p><p>\u201cWorth a shot,\u201d Ty said defensively. \u201dDo these things have batteries?\u201d he asked as he shook the receiver near his ear and listened for something to rattle inside it. Zane ignored him, and Ty looked back down the street critically. \u201cNowhere to hide,\u201d he commented. He glanced back at Zane. \u201cWe\u2019ll use this explosion as cover. Maybe buy us enough time to clear out.\u201d</p><p>Zane finished programming their detonator and joined him at the window. \u201cI guess it was too much to ask that Benson had his shit together. I knew I should have taken Stanford\u2019s bet that he\u2019d flop against the Feds. I could\u2019ve bought a new Glock.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhatever, man,\u201d Ty grunted, not really paying attention to Zane\u2019s grumbling. \u201cLet\u2019s go blow shit up,\u201d he said with relish as he moved out of the building.</p><p>They hugged the storefronts, moving along the street toward the target.</p><p>Ty was examining the entrance to the alley coming up when Zane abruptly grabbed his arm and yanked him down just as something hit the brick wall over their heads with a dull thump. The shot had barely missed his head.</p> <p>Zane already had his gun up, shooting indiscriminately at the two-man team that had appeared out of the door of a nearby building. The two agents retreated back into the barbershop under the hail of bullets Zane sent their way.</p><p>\u201cMove!\u201d Zane hissed.</p><p>They scuttled along the side of the building, no longer concerned with stealth. The mission now was to blow the ammo dump they\u2019d just left\u2014their assignment as Charlie Team\u2014and then they had to get close enough to fulfill Alpha Team\u2019s failed objective using the coordinated triggers.</p><p>Ty skidded to a halt as they reached another narrow alley and peered around the corner. Agents were running along the length of it, and more were coming up behind them. He and Zane put their backs to each other and fired in opposite directions, forcing the encroaching patrols to dive for cover.</p><p>\u201cThe cars!\u201d Zane said harshly, and they darted across the street toward a row of parked cars, the action getting them closer to the building even as it offered cover. As they ran, Zane pulled the detonator he\u2019d just programmed out of his pocket and flipped it. Behind them, the weapons cache blew, blowing the door open, making a mess of the windows and the street in front of the building.</p> <p>It bought them just a little more time as the agents in pursuit ducked and covered or turned to look.</p><p>But after no more than half a block, they were forced to duck behind a Lincoln land yacht as more shots came at them from across the street. Zane flinched as a shot smacked the bricks ten feet away. They were pretty damn well pinned down; Zane took a glance over the hood and quickly hunched back down as more ammunition skimmed over their heads.</p><p>\u201cTen fucking yards,\u201d he said harshly, turning his chin, his dark eyes meeting Ty\u2019s.</p><p>Ty smiled at him, barely resisting the urge to grab him and kiss him. \u201cWe could pull a Butch and Sundance,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I did not come here to die today,\u201d Zane said smartly as he put a fresh clip in his gun. Despite his annoyed tone, he looked amused and his eyes sparkled wickedly. \u201cDon\u2019t have a better idea, though.\u201d After a moment, he gave Ty a half-smile. \u201cIt was fun, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Ty grinned back at him and nodded, switching out his empty cartridge and pulling out extra guns to set them aside. \u201cAlways knew I should have gone the Dark Side route,\u201d he mused.</p> <p>Zane laughed quietly and was checking his two guns when they heard \u201cFederal agents!\u201d shouted by one of their pursuers.</p><p>Looking under the car, Ty could see the feet of the dozen or so agents surrounding them.</p><p>\u201cToss out your weapons and come out with your hands behind your head!\u201d one of them called out.</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cDid we ever sound that stupid when we said that?\u201d he asked as he consolidated his supply of ammo. With two guns, he had enough for a last stand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was more the \u2018drop it or you\u2019re getting it in the head\u2019 kinda guy,\u201d Zane muttered. He winked at Ty and turned so he was facing the car where he crouched.</p><p>They had one advantage. The agents who were swiftly surrounding them would have to wait until no other option existed before they fired on their quarry. They would have to give warning, just like the good little Feds they were.</p><p>Ty and Zane were no longer constrained by such delicacies.</p><p>\u201cOn three?\u201d Zane suggested.</p> <p>Ty glanced over at him and then to his side, toward the building that was just out of range of their receiver. They were so close. Ty narrowed his eyes and looked at Zane again speculatively. Two out of three just didn\u2019t sit well with him. \u201cReady,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d Zane said under his breath. \u201cTwo. Th\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before Zane could stand, Ty reached out and grabbed him around the neck, yanking him up and to the side, putting Zane between himself and the agents as he dragged him sideways around the car they were using as cover.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Zane squawked, heels kicking out as he struggled to get hold of Ty\u2019s arm around his throat that was bowing his body back.</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked it when I did this, darlin\u2019,\u201d Ty breathed into Zane\u2019s ear with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cGoddamnit,\u201d Zane huffed, sounding like he was trying not to laugh.</p><p>At least a dozen agents leveled their guns at them. Some knelt in the middle of the street behind large black ballistic shields in pairs. Others used the cars parked along the street as cover.</p><p>Several agents were yelling at them, telling them to stop, to drop their guns, to hit the ground. Ty ignored them, moving slowly toward the building, hiding behind Zane and pointing his gun at the agents who followed.</p><p>When a couple of the agents looked like they might be getting brave, Ty moved the gun to point the muzzle at Zane\u2019s head, grinning as he shouted, \u201cStop moving or I shoot him!\u201d</p><p>The agents paused, looking at him warily and giving each other confused glances, but then they resumed their advance, following as Ty drew them backward.</p><p>Zane turned his head to the side, eyes shifting to look around them as he growled, \u201cIf they don\u2019t kill you, I will!\u201d And then with no warning, he stopped struggling in Ty\u2019s arms. \u201dNow,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>Ty pushed the button of the switch he held in his hand, tightening his grip on Zane so he couldn\u2019t get away. The building down the street\u2014Alpha team\u2019s objective\u2014gave off a muffled whump, dust flying off the roof and the bricks as the charges made a mess of the inside. The agents flinched and ducked before continuing to shout at them to drop their weapons.</p><p>\u201cHappy trails, Lone Star,\u201d Ty breathed to Zane as he raised his gun under Zane\u2019s arm and fired several times, hitting the shields with dull thumps, just as Zane did the same with his two guns.</p><p>But when the agents returned fire, Ty ducked his head behind his human shield. Zane howled in pain, and his body jerked hard as he took the volley of shots right in the chest. When he started to collapse, Ty let him go and turned, running for cover.</p><p>A SERIES of piercing whistles sounded from one of the building tops.</p><p>Agents began filtering out from their locations, some of them covered with red paint where they\u2019d been shot. The other two \u201cterrorist\u201d teams were brought out as well, all four of them covered in the blue paint of the FBI agents-in-training.</p><p>When everyone gathered in the middle of the street around the instructors who\u2019d been observing from various points through the town, Special Agent Ty Grady emerged from the spot of safety he\u2019d managed to reach, completely unscathed.</p><p>And Special Agent Zane Garrett sat up from where he lay sprawled on the asphalt, his chest soaked with blue paint.</p><p>He may have been covered in blue, but he was seeing red. Zane looked over his shoulder right at Ty and glared at him evilly. \u201cYou bastard. You cut and run?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged unapologetically as he walked up to stand over him. \u201cEvery man for himself, partner,\u201d he said with a wide grin. \u201cLast man standing,\u201d he announced triumphantly with his arms spread wide.</p><p>\u201cI can change that,\u201d Zane promised darkly, torn between being angry and surprised or amused and resigned. Ty had not only used him as a distraction to make his escape but also left him behind. Zane wasn\u2019t even sure if it should bother him at all either way. It was just a training game, after all. And as he saw how relaxed and happy Ty looked, Zane could only sigh and set his arms on his propped-up knees, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cTrainees! Not only did all three points receive fatal damage, and not only did we not capture a live prisoner to interrogate, but you let one of the terrorist agents get away!\u201d Special Agent Jason Stanford announced angrily, his voice booming out of his lanky frame. He was wearing a gray FBI sweatshirt and khakis like all the trainees. \u201cBut before I rip you all new assholes, let me introduce the men who just ran the table on you. This is Special Agent Ty Grady, who was raised by wolves, if that makes any of you feel better about getting your asses kicked,\u201d he said, pointing at Ty.</p><p>\u201cI thought they hired actors for these things,\u201d one of the trainees called out. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know we were up against trained agents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expect to face actors in the field?\u201d Zane pointed out as he stood up and shook his hands while he glared at the newbie agents. Blue paint splattered on the asphalt as it dripped off him. How many paintballs had hit him? Those little fuckers hurt!</p><p>Stanford looked at Zane with a smirk. \u201cAnd this is the very dead Special Agent Zane Garrett, who was apparently raised by Kevlar,\u201d he told his agents-in-training. \u201cNicely done, Special Agent Garrett.\u201d Zane glared at him, too, just for good measure.</p><p>\u201cThat was cold, man,\u201d one of the trainees muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Zane muttered, glancing Ty\u2019s way again. Ty studiously ignored him, though, blatantly pretending not to notice the look.</p><p>Stanford went on to introduce the other four agents participating as Zane swiped at the paint along his chest and arms. Ty stepped slightly away from Zane as the paint spattered, wiping delicately at a spot on his leg that may or may not have had blue paint on it. Zane narrowed his eyes as he watched him, considering what his chances were of tackling his partner to the street and kicking his ass. Or at least smearing him with paint. There was such a thing as enjoying oneself too much at your partner\u2019s expense.</p><p>At least he wasn\u2019t humming or whistling anymore. Or, God forbid, singing. Zane always knew there was trouble coming when Ty started making up his own words to \u201cBattle Hymn of the Republic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe special agents participating today are on loan to us for this exercise,\u201d Stanford continued with a smug smile. \u201cGive them all a hand, if you will, and be sure to try to learn something from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was kind of awesome,\u201d one guy said from the back of the crowd. The back of his sweatshirt had one small red splotch to indicate where he\u2019d been shot. He was the man who\u2019d tackled Zane. \u201cTook three of us out without even saying anything to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter years of working closely with your partner, you too will develop that skill,\u201d Stanford said, blithely disregarding the fact that he knew Ty and Zane hadn\u2019t been officially partnered for more than five or six weeks. Zane suppressed the urge to smile. \u201cIt\u2019s something that can\u2019t be taught,\u201d Stanford added.</p><p>\u201cPartners use each other as human shields often?\u201d one of the group asked wryly.</p><p>\u201cNever underestimate your enemy\u2019s will to live or his mental instability,\u201d Ty advised with a smirk. \u201cYou may be taught never to leave a man behind. Doesn\u2019t mean they are. Expect anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, gentlemen. You were a big help today,\u201d Stanford said to Ty, Zane, and the other four special agents. He turned and started lecturing the trainees, many of whom peered around him to watch Zane turn on his partner, hands on his hips, looking none too pleased.</p><p>\u201cLast man standing, huh?\u201d Zane asked, voice dropping dangerously low. His chest was starting to ache under the protective vest he was wearing.</p><p>But Ty merely smiled at him and held up the switch he\u2019d used to trigger the pyrotechnics in the targeted building. \u201cWe won,\u201d he said happily.</p><p>Zane made a disgusted sound in his throat even as his mouth threatened to turn up at the corners in the face of Ty\u2019s childish glee. \u201cYou\u2019re too damn pleased with yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we won,\u201d Ty repeated, grinning widely in his pristine uniform.</p><p>\u201cKeep talking,\u201d Zane dared him. \u201cPlease. Keep talking.\u201d Ty was only about four feet away, and Zane figured it was even money that he could take him down. Ty would probably kick his ass in the end, though, and it would also ruin Ty\u2019s good mood. Zane grimaced.</p><p>Ty looked down at the switch, still smiling. \u201cSpoilsport,\u201d he said to Zane in a low voice, and then he tossed the switch to Stanford with a nod. The man was watching them in amusement, his smirk indicating that he was just as eager to see if Zane would retaliate as his class was.</p><p>\u201cNext time try not to leave the place in pieces,\u201d Stanford said to them with a smile.</p><p>\u201cNo promises,\u201d Zane said, hands up as if to ward off the future. \u201cThey don\u2019t let Grady out of his cage often enough.\u201d Then he remembered something that actually made him smile. \u201cC\u2019mon, Grady. You drove today, remember?\u201d</p><p>Ty pursed his lips, glancing at Stanford as he tried not to smile. He shook the man\u2019s hand, thanking him for the opportunity to come blow shit up and shoot people, and then he joined Zane as they headed out of the little mock-up FBI town called Hogan\u2019s Alley.</p><p>\u201cYou brought a change of clothes, right?\u201d Ty asked Zane as he looked him over critically.</p><p>Zane stopped in place and just stared at him. He could feel the paint dribbling down his neck, into the collar of his jacket, and curling along his palms and fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked innocently, his eyes wide.</p><p>Zane crossed his arms, heedless of how it spread the paint more across his jacket. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to turn into a wide-open target.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s lips twitched, and it was clear that he was desperately trying to hold on to the innocent facade. \u201cHow many months have you been my partner?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cOn the books or off?\u201d Zane asked with equal nonchalance.</p><p>Ty finally let a smirk play across his lips, and he stepped closer. \u201cEither way, you should know you\u2019re always a target,\u201d he advised, his voice low and teasing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane rolled his eyes. \u201cFunny guy.\u201d He uncrossed his arms and looked down at himself. \u201cI\u2019m a mess, and it\u2019s your fault. What are you gonna do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake you walk home,\u201d Ty answered seriously as he twirled his car keys around his finger and turned to head off for his Bronco again.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Grady,\u201d Zane complained as he followed. \u201cI brought you down here, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ty acknowledged. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you, those could have been real bullets and bombs we were playing with,\u201d he said pointedly. \u201cBut no,\u201d he drawled out in disappointment.</p><p>Zane stopped at the side of the truck. \u201cI passed the tests, okay? Should be any day now we get the word from Burns.\u201d He opened the back door and pulled out a duffel bag.</p><p>\u201cDid you really bring a change of clothes?\u201d Ty asked in surprise as he tossed his gear into the back seat.</p><p>Zane favored Ty with an aggravated look, but he was still pleased enough with the day not to get pissy about it. \u201cI figured you\u2019d find some way to fuck me over,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been bouncing off the walls for over a week now, and I\u2019m your favorite target lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still pissy about the rubber band cannon?\u201d Ty asked him in exasperation.</p> <p>\u201cUgh.\u201d Zane started unbuttoning the BDU blouse. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky that guy from accounting didn\u2019t know it was you when his toupee went flying. He might have rerouted your next paycheck to Greenpeace.\u201d</p><p>Ty began snickering softly, obviously trying to hold in the laughter. He closed the back door and leaned against the rear of the Bronco to look at Zane critically. \u201cAll the puns in my arsenal, and I can\u2019t think of a single blue joke,\u201d he said mournfully.</p><p>Zane carefully pulled the heavy green and black camouflage jacket off, turning it totally inside out as he did. \u201cOff your game, Grady,\u201d he said distractedly as he set the folded-up blouse on the pavement next to his feet and started digging in his duffel for a towel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just pissed \u2019cause you got riddled with holes,\u201d Ty grunted as he turned to head for the driver\u2019s side door.</p><p>Zane had to smile as he shook his head. Ty had been going crazy in the office for the past five weeks, so when he\u2019d heard about the chance to come over here to Quantico for the day, Zane had jumped at it and dragged his raving-mad partner along. With a sigh, Zane wiped pretty much all the paint off his hands and swiped under his chin a couple times before folding up the towel and shoving it and the now-blue uniform blouse in the duffel.</p><p>Ty had the truck running when Zane got into the passenger seat and shut the door.</p> <p>Ty was looking at him with a crooked smile. Zane raised one eyebrow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was fun,\u201d Ty told him in a pleased voice, one Zane hadn\u2019t heard much lately.</p><p>Whatever annoyance he\u2019d been feeling faded in the face of Ty\u2019s unholy glee. \u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoyed it,\u201d he said, giving his partner a tolerant look. Maybe Ty would be a little easier to live with for a day or two. Which would in turn make Zane a little less cranky as well. It might just be a decent week after all.</p><p>Ty gave him a wicked laugh as he pulled the Bronco out of its spot, pointing them back toward DC.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>\u201cSO, SPECIAL Agent Garrett, I understand you\u2019ve finished your evaluations,\u201d the Assistant Director of the Criminal Investigative Division said from where he sat behind his large mahogany desk. The desk stood out against the drab colors of the paint and carpet and matched the wall of bookshelves that warmed the room.</p><p>FBI Special Agent Zane Garrett stood at the window, looking out at the wet, dirty streets of Washington, DC, and desperately wishing he could be anywhere else. He could see his boss in the window; the man behind the desk held several files in his hand as he looked at Zane with raised eyebrows.</p><p>Zane sneered at his own reflection in the window. The shadows under his eyes and wrinkles from his frown were pronounced above his slightly crooked nose, giving him a rough and tumble appearance even though he was clean-shaven. The scraped cheeks were in sharp contrast to his slightly overgrown dark brown hair. Looking at himself, he acknowledged that, despite the muscular build cloaked in black slacks and a royal blue dress shirt, he wasn\u2019t any prize right now.</p> <p>He had been assigned to the DC office for five weeks, along with his partner, after they\u2019d been reunited in this very office following five miserable months apart. Upon receiving the new assignment, they had both been relegated to deskwork for various reasons, not the least of which was the physical and mental aftereffects of the turbulent past year or so. For him, it had been an especially rough year. Ty seemed better able to shake off the past than he did. Zane took a steadying breath and slid his hands into his pockets, shifting uncomfortably in place.</p><p>He winced and turned to look at Richard Burns. He\u2019d known the meeting today would be... rocky.</p><p>\u201cYou passed the academic and physical testing, but you know that already. You also know you managed to flunk the mental evaluation that would have cleared you for field duty,\u201d Burns said in concern.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t answer as he folded his arms in front of himself, wondering what he could say to explain. There was so much shit bouncing around in his head that he wasn\u2019t sure himself why he\u2019d had such a tough time with an evaluation he should have been able to bullshit through easily. He just hadn\u2019t been able to focus.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s a legitimate reason you can\u2019t get your head out of your ass, I\u2019d like to hear it,\u201d Burns invited as he looked back up at Zane. He paused, probably waiting to see if Zane would say anything. When he received no comment, Burns continued. \u201cIs it your partner?\u201d he asked carefully.</p><p>Zane\u2019s shoulders stiffened, and he shook his head quickly. His partner had a reputation throughout the Bureau for being hard to work with; Zane had found in the last five weeks that he got more apologetic looks from his co-workers now that he was working with Special Agent Ty Grady than he\u2019d gotten when his wife had died. But Zane didn\u2019t have a problem working with Ty. Not for the same reason others did, anyway.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been hard,\u201d he hedged. \u201cGetting over what happened.\u201d</p><p>That was an understatement. The truth was that he\u2019d been fighting insomnia, acute headaches, and suffering through nightmares when he actually did sleep alone. Tracking down a serial killer intent on not being caught was hazardous to your health, both mentally and physically, and nearly getting killed in a vicious car wreck during the hunt almost six months ago had contributed to his problems. He\u2019d recovered surprisingly well\u2014physically. He\u2019d attended his rehab appointments and gym times religiously. But the rest....</p><p>He\u2019d been able to ignore it as long as he\u2019d had Ty in bed next to him. When Zane first got into his company-issue extended-stay hotel suite, Ty had been there almost every night, only going home to Baltimore once or twice a week to switch out his clothing. Over the next five weeks, though, as they\u2019d languished in deskwork waiting to be cleared for the field, the overnight stays had tapered off until Ty showed up only once or twice a week, if at all. The less Ty showed up, the less Zane slept. And while it did wonders for his physical rehab and workout schedule, it was also one of the reasons Zane had been feeling somewhat disconnected, both from his job and from his partner.</p><p>Burns watched him knowingly. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly understandable,\u201d he finally agreed. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019ve decided to give you a few more weeks of vacation before your official evals take place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane asked in surprise. While he felt a wave of relief that he was getting a reprieve, he also felt his stomach plummet nervously. There was always a catch with Dick Burns.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your partner, Zane?\u201d Burns asked.</p><p>Zane blinked a few times at the unexpected query. \u201cGrady?\u201d he asked warily.</p><p>Burns\u2019 mouth turned up in a half smile. \u201cDo you have another partner I should know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane said quickly. \u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d He and Grady got along. Most of the time. Mostly in bed. The last few weeks had been a disappointing stretch, though; apparently not having a psychopath trying to kill them was slightly detrimental to forming any sort of personal relationship.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Burns repeated.</p><p>Zane waved a hand around. \u201cYeah. Fine. I guess. Trying to stay busy.\u201d He rolled his eyes, thinking about the whirlwind of attitude and energy from Ty he dealt with every day. \u201cHe can\u2019t sit still,\u201d he told Burns.</p><p>Burns looked highly amused as he tipped back in his leather chair. \u201cNo, he can\u2019t. He never could. But then, neither can you,\u201d he pointed out, looking significantly at the comfortable wingback chairs in front of his desk.</p><p>Zane shrugged uncomfortably but took the hint and moved to the chair Burns had indicated. \u201cGrady spends most of his free time at the gym, as far as I know,\u201d he said, hoping to move the focus off himself. \u201cAt the office we try to keep him distracted so he doesn\u2019t burn down the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he handling deskwork?\u201d Burns asked knowingly.</p><p>Zane glared at him, clearly communicating that he knew it was a bullshit question. \u201cHe\u2019s about as helpful as you\u2019d figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard about your little day trip down to Quantico,\u201d Burns said as he frowned and pulled back his white shirtsleeve to check his watch.</p><p>\u201cWe did pretty damn well in that exercise,\u201d Zane pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIf you consider going down in a blaze of glory and paintballs \u2018doing well,\u2019\u201d Burns said with a hint of a smile. \u201dThe real test will come when you\u2019re back in the field. If you ever get there,\u201d he said seriously.</p><p>\u201cYou know how much Grady likes to win,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>Burns pursed his lips and nodded. He seemed torn between amusement and concern. \u201cWell, take comfort in the fact they weren\u2019t real bullets, I guess,\u201d he offered finally.</p><p>Zane leaned forward to brace his elbows on his knees and laced his fingers together. Although Ty\u2019s actions at the time had been surprising, Zane figured he understood. It was just a game. Ty wouldn\u2019t leave him alone when it counted. Not if there was anything he could do about it. \u201cReal bullets change everything,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cRemember that when you\u2019re back in the field,\u201d Burns requested wryly. \u201cYou have another evaluation set up in three weeks\u2019 time,\u201d Burns told Zane, his voice soft. \u201cAt which point I expect you to pass with flying colors. Your place is in the field,\u201d he asserted. \u201cIf I can\u2019t put you there after your vacation, I have no further use for you. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Zane swallowed hard on the bile in his throat. That meant either a forced transfer to a desk job in another division\u2014which would be terrible\u2014or early retirement. Zane didn\u2019t even want to think about that. He wouldn\u2019t have anything left without this job or his partner. Without Ty.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy your time off, Zane, starting right now,\u201d Burns offered sincerely. \u201cGrady is getting several death threats a day from the office staff, so he\u2019s been \u2018granted\u2019 two weeks of his own,\u201d he added in a long-suffering voice. \u201cWhat you do with your time off is none of my concern. Just don\u2019t do it here.\u201d</p><p>Zane suppressed a groan. The last vacation he\u2019d taken was a disastrous trip back to Texas to see his family. Most of it had been spent avoiding his family. \u201cAll right,\u201d he agreed, his tone resigned. At this point, sitting alone in his hotel suite would just make things worse, but he really didn\u2019t know what else to do. He hadn\u2019t felt this lost in a long time, and unlike the past, he didn\u2019t have drugs or alcohol to blame or to turn to. This time it was all on him.</p><p>Burns was watching him closely. \u201cHave you thought about seeing a psychiatrist?\u201d he asked carefully.</p><p>Zane flinched. He\u2019d known this was coming, but it didn\u2019t make hearing it any less painful. He really didn\u2019t want to go that route if he could avoid it. He wouldn\u2019t wish all the shit in his head on anybody.</p><p>\u201cWhen you get back, there\u2019s someone I\u2019d like you to speak to if you\u2019re still having difficulty,\u201d Burns told him with a sigh. \u201cHe\u2019s not a Bureau doctor. He\u2019s just a friend of mine who is very good.\u201d Zane nodded slowly, and Burns took pity on him and smiled slightly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Garrett. It\u2019ll be all right. Find a hobby or something. Take up knitting,\u201d he suggested with a twinkle of amusement in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cKnitting,\u201d Zane repeated flatly.</p><p>Burns nodded as there was a knock on the door to his office, and his harried assistant opened it. Burns waved her off as a man pushed past her to enter. Zane turned to see his partner and looked back at Burns with a frown, wondering what was going on.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Special Agent Grady,\u201d Burns greeted pleasantly, completely unfazed by Ty\u2019s entrance. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lousy liar, Dick,\u201d Ty Grady muttered as he ushered Burns\u2019 secretary back out and shut the door in her face. He turned back around and glowered. \u201cI just got off the phone with my dad,\u201d he announced accusingly. \u201cSaid he was looking forward to seeing me this week. Know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>Burns merely cleared his throat and smiled.</p><p>Zane ran his eyes over Ty, skimming over the close-cropped hair and clean-shaven face before moving his attention down over the sand-colored suit and black shirt he was wearing. The tailored suits he\u2019d been wearing while on duty in DC looked incredible on him, though Zane knew Ty hated to wear them. He managed to look loose and comfortable in them despite the almost constant fidgeting they caused him. The tie took the brunt of the fussing during the day. It was usually gone by lunch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was amusing to watch him, and Zane did so every day with not a little sympathy. Although, Zane admitted silently, it was worlds better to see his partner like this than as the still, silent ghost of himself Ty had been after the major concussion he\u2019d suffered on their last case.</p><p>Right now, Ty looked annoyed, the slight wrinkling of his narrow nose matching his furrowed brow and sparking greenish eyes. He was angry; it was obvious in the sharp and annoyed movements of his lanky, muscled body and the tightness in his jaw.</p><p>Ty moved further into the office, glancing at Zane as if he were just noticing him there. He pointed at Zane accusingly. \u201cWhat\u2019s he done now?\u201d he demanded of Burns.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would you suppose he\u2019s done anything?\u201d Burns asked. Ty opened his mouth to speak, but Burns was faster. \u201cFrom what I understand, you two are wreaking more havoc amongst the office drones than you ever did in the field. Got anything to say to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty huffed in response. \u201cStop giving my dad progress reports!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an old friend, Ty,\u201d Burns said to him in a low voice. \u201cAnd I will talk to him whenever I goddamned please. Sit down,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Ty hesitated stubbornly for a moment and then reluctantly moved to obey, flopping into the seat beside Zane. He glared at his partner, as if his being there were somehow Zane\u2019s fault. Zane rolled his eyes and turned his chin so he was looking back out the window.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here?\u201d Ty asked impatiently.</p> <p>\u201cTo embarrass me for jackassing my eval,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here to amuse me,\u201d Burns corrected in a sarcastically sweet tone. \u201cBut now that you mention the tests....\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced over at Zane and frowned slightly. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked, the annoyance draining away, replaced by growing concern.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think anything\u2019s going on?\u201d Burns asked curiously. \u201cSmell something in the wind, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Ty responded warily as he looked between them, either oblivious to Burns\u2019 sarcasm or ignoring it.</p><p>\u201cGarrett is going on a little vacation,\u201d Burns answered as he leaned back in his chair.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? How long?\u201d Ty demanded.</p><p>\u201cThree weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty repeated, slightly more panicked. \u201cBut who will I get to do my paperwork?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Zane swore quietly. Burns was practically kicking his ass to the curb, and all Ty could think about was the paperwork. Classy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still filling out forms from throwing his gun at that cab!\u201d Ty told Burns.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips quirked. Every bullet fired from a service weapon had to be accompanied with a written report for the Bureau. Ty had fired... quite a few bullets at the cab that had almost smeared them across the highway in New York City. Zane didn\u2019t know what paperwork you had to fill out for throwing your gun at something. He\u2019d never tried that before. Hell, he\u2019d never even thought of it before.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the paperwork,\u201d Burns told Ty with a grin. \u201cYou can finish it when you get back.\u201d</p><p>Ty went silent, pursing his lips as he gave both Burns and Zane measuring looks. \u201cWhere am I going?\u201d he asked carefully as he looked between them again.</p> <p>Zane knew Burns sometimes sent Ty off to mysterious places that never produced paperwork. He had yet to find the right opportunity to ask about that though. Ty probably thought he was being sent on one of those trips now. \u201cI\u2019m going on \u2018vacation,\u2019 remember?\u201d Zane reminded him, internally bracing for impact.</p><p>\u201cWhat, I have to go with him?\u201d Ty asked incredulously. \u201cWhy the hell am I being punished too? Jesus Christ, Dick, I\u2019d rather take his damn tests for him than be sent off into exile!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you do any better?\u201d Burns asked pointedly.</p><p>Ty leaned forward in his chair and smacked his hand against the desk. \u201cI have never fucked up an eval,\u201d he protested in a hurt voice.</p><p>Burns slowly raised an eyebrow. He leaned forward and pushed the folders on his desk around slowly. Then he picked one up and tapped it on the desk, giving Ty a significant look.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked, his tone suspicious.</p><p>Burns silently slid the folder across the desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Ty asked as he took the folder and opened it.</p><p>\u201cYour latest psych evaluation,\u201d Burns answered without commenting further.</p><p>Ty frowned as he looked at the file and began shaking his head before he snapped the folder shut again, tossing it onto the desk. \u201cIs this medical leave then?\u201d he asked tightly.</p><p>Zane sat quietly, taking in the news that Ty must have failed his most recent psychological exam as well. He was surprised. While he himself\u2014usually\u2014was pretty damn good at lying his way through just about any test, Ty was an expert at hiding things he didn\u2019t want other people to know, and mental problems would be at the top of that list. Zane frowned. Ty must not have recovered from the trauma suffered at the hands of the Tri-State killer as well as he claimed. Zane could understand that. He knew Ty had faced almost certain death when Tim Henninger had bricked him into a catacomb and left him in the dark to die. That had to affect a man, especially one whose sanity already teetered on the edge on a good day.</p><p>\u201cAs I told your partner, these results will never see the light of day,\u201d Burns was informing Ty. \u201cYour real evals will be given in two weeks. Zane\u2019s in three. Until then, you are both officially on vacation.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent, staring at Burns until Burns actually shifted in his chair as he met Ty\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy dad knew you were sending me on vacation,\u201d Ty stated. \u201cHe know what\u2019s in that file too?\u201d he asked him softly.</p><p>Burns gave a shake of his head in answer. \u201cYou know better,\u201d he chastised. \u201cBut your father asks after you, Ty,\u201d he said in a surprisingly gentle voice. \u201cHe worries. Maybe if you called home more often I wouldn\u2019t have to give him news when I talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head imperceptibly, feeling suddenly uncomfortable about being there. There\u2019d always been something more between Grady and Dick Burns than merely a relationship between agent and director. Now he had some idea of what it was. Burns knew Ty\u2019s family, and fairly well, from the sound of it. While their relationship seemed nice on the surface, he could imagine it was a nightmare for Ty, who was so protective of his privacy. Zane didn\u2019t want to think about what he\u2019d do if Burns had a direct line to his own father. He shifted to study his partner, whose face was stony and blank.</p><p>\u201cGarrett, we\u2019re done,\u201d Burns announced without looking away from Ty. \u201cWould you excuse us?\u201d</p><p>Zane hesitated for a long moment and then murmured, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d before standing and exiting the room without looking at his partner again. Once he got out of the main office and shut the door, he leaned back against the wall and exhaled heavily.</p><p>Well, it could have been worse.</p><p>TY LOOKED down at the file on the desk again, waiting until he heard the door click, and then he looked back up and met Burns\u2019 eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d Burns answered. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Dick,\u201d Ty pleaded. \u201cYou take this job away from either of us, and we\u2019re both done,\u201d he said with a tap to his own temple.</p><p>Burns raised an eyebrow. \u201cIs that so? Both of you?\u201d</p><p>Ty cocked his head, trying not to react too obviously to anything Burns said or did. But Burns didn\u2019t look away; he just watched and waited.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty finally asked, feeling uncomfortable under the older man\u2019s piercing gaze.</p><p>Finally sniffing, Burns relaxed back into his chair. \u201cI have it on very good authority that without this particular job, you would have three more waiting for you,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cFrom organizations that would be less concerned about your mental health than I might be.\u201d</p><p>Ty shifted, trying not to fidget.</p><p>\u201cI know why you stay here, Ty, and I\u2019m grateful to you,\u201d Burns went on in a gentler tone. \u201cBut I begin to wonder how long I can keep you here before you just go stark raving mad on me. They\u2019re still cleaning up paint in Hogan\u2019s Alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t all me,\u201d Ty reminded defensively.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe me your dad\u2019s loyalty,\u201d Burns told him, ignoring his interruption. \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed heavily and linked his fingers together, trying harder not to shift around in the creaky old wingback.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily you I\u2019m worried about here, kiddo,\u201d Burns continued. \u201cIf abnormal psych evals from you concerned me overly much, I\u2019d never get any sleep.\u201d He paused. \u201cTell me about your partner, Ty,\u201d he requested. \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>Ty met Burns\u2019 eyes carefully, wondering just how much the man knew about him and Zane. But it was safer to play dumb than it was to try and find out. No matter how well Ty knew Burns, something like fucking around with his partner wouldn\u2019t go unpunished.</p><p>Ty shrugged, deciding to bypass the other comments for the one he was comfortable talking about. \u201cHe\u2019s struggling a little,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you done anything? Or said anything?\u201d Burns asked, his voice flat.</p><p>\u201cTo who?\u201d Ty asked calmly. \u201cYou? You telling me you didn\u2019t know? Thought he\u2019d be okay right back in Miami after all we went through?\u201d After healing up from his injuries in New York, Zane had been pitched right back into undercover work. It hadn\u2019t gone particularly well, and although he\u2019d kept away from the drugs and the drink, he\u2019d definitely been a mess in the head when he\u2019d gotten back to DC to be re-partnered with Ty.</p><p>Burns\u2019 face took on a pinched look, and he shook his head. \u201cI made a mistake, Ty. It happens to the best of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does,\u201d Ty agreed. He nodded at the file on the desk. \u201cMy marks are low, but they\u2019re acceptable. So I\u2019m guessing you want me gone for a reason. Tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m juggling some paperwork here,\u201d Burns informed him, his shoulders sagging to show how exhausted he really was. \u201cIn order to bury these current tests, I have to have both of you make yourselves scarce for a while. Nothing more sinister than that,\u201d he assured Ty.</p><p>\u201cDick,\u201d Ty protested weakly. He hated the thought of sitting on his ass, twiddling his thumbs.</p><p>Burns raised his voice, speaking over Ty\u2019s objections. \u201cAfter these evaluations go through, you\u2019ll both be reassigned to the Baltimore office. I bet you\u2019ll be happy to return home.\u201d</p><p>Ty eyed Burns warily. It would be good to get back to Baltimore. He had buddies there, and he considered the city home after nearly four years. He was still living there through the temporary DC assignment, making the commute every day and occasionally shacking up with Zane in his DC hotel room when he didn\u2019t want to go home.</p><p>The drive back and forth was murder.</p><p>A move back to Baltimore was good news. But he knew there was something he was missing here, some catch in the arrangement that Dick was about to throw in. He had a feeling he knew what it was too.</p><p>\u201cHave a nice trip, Ty,\u201d Burns offered with a smile. \u201cSay hello to the family for me,\u201d he told him with a hint of mischief in his eyes.</p><p>Ty stared at him. \u201cThe family,\u201d he echoed. \u201cMy family?\u201d</p><p>Burns just smiled and pushed the folders in front of him into a neat stack once more. Ty warred with himself. He wanted to ask questions, but he didn\u2019t feel like getting into it with Burns about his family. Or about Zane. \u201cIs that all?\u201d he asked after a long moment of contemplation.</p><p>\u201cUnless you want to talk about which part of your training gave you the idea to use your partner as paintball repellant?\u201d Burns inquired with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>Ty pursed his lips to keep a smile from forming.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Burns replied with a shake of his head. Ty saw his lips twitch in amusement. \u201cThen yes, Special Agent Grady. That is all,\u201d he confirmed without ever allowing the smile to surface.</p><p>\u201cNext time can you do this on the phone?\u201d Ty asked as he stood and turned away, heading for the door with a frown. \u201cIt\u2019s a long fucking drive from Baltimore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay hello to Earl for me,\u201d Burns requested, a smile in his voice.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t respond as he exited the office. He walked through the outer office, head down and face set in a worried frown as he contemplated the next two weeks. It was quite clear what he was supposed to do. A trip to West Virginia was in his immediate future. He ignored the hateful woman at the receptionist\u2019s desk as he left the office and headed for the elevators.</p><p>\u201cGrady.\u201d</p><p>Ty stopped abruptly and turned in place to look back at Zane in surprise. He hadn\u2019t expected him to stick around. \u201cHey,\u201d he responded, unable to think of anything else to say.</p><p>Zane\u2019s face was blank, and his shoulders were pulled back stiff. He was obviously expecting some sort of bitching out over the evals. He was all geared up for a fight. It seemed like Zane was always geared up for a fight lately, and Ty was running out of ways to handle him. It was tiring, and he\u2019d been seeking solitude more often than not just to give himself a break.</p><p>Ty gave him a jerk of his head. \u201cCome buy me some coffee,\u201d he requested as he hit the button for the elevator.</p><p>Zane frowned and walked slowly toward Ty and the elevator. \u201cYou don\u2019t drink coffee,\u201d he said with a suspicious note in his voice.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Ty responded with a slight tilt of his head as he looked sideways at Zane, who held his gaze only for a moment before dropping his eyes. Ty frowned. They weren\u2019t connecting like they had been, and he wondered when it had happened and why neither of them had noticed. The only time they seemed to click on all cylinders was when they were working\u2014or playing\u2014and the thought made Ty slightly sad and maybe a little hurt. He brushed it off, though. There was no point in forcing the issue. Things like that came and went, whether you wanted them to or not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane shrugged. \u201cFine. Coffee.\u201d He looked at Ty speculatively. \u201cWhat did Burns tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re fucked in the head,\u201d Ty responded as he turned and looked at Zane with narrowed eyes, taking in how on edge Zane seemed. Defensive. \u201cWhat have you been doing about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d Ty asked in amusement. \u201cAside from me?\u201d he added.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips compressed, but then his eyes closed for a moment, he half smiled, and some of the tension eased. He slid one hand into his pants pocket. \u201cPlanning my next chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up,\u201d Ty muttered as the elevator doors opened. He stepped in and punched the button for the ground floor. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said to Zane with a sigh. \u201cI have to go home and pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually going somewhere?\u201d Zane asked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI have not-so-subtle orders to go see my family,\u201d Ty answered wryly. He cocked his head as he studied Zane again. \u201cYou\u2019re going to spend three weeks just sitting around your hotel room and moping, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked knowingly.</p> <p>Zane sighed and crossed his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t really know where I\u2019d go. I\u2019m not going to Texas again.\u201d</p><p>Ty hesitated, looking him up and down. The thought of inviting Zane to accompany him to West Virginia was appealing, in a way. If things went south, Ty could throw Zane in front of his parents just like he had the paintballs. Use him as a sort of human sacrifice. And then there was the added benefit of having Zane close every night. He\u2019d come to enjoy that when it still happened, despite how he wanted to throttle Zane sometimes.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come with me?\u201d he asked tentatively.</p><p>Zane stared at him, obviously thinking it was a joke. \u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, maybe not. But I need you,\u201d Ty told him as he reached out and stopped the doors from closing. He knew Zane well enough to know how to manipulate him. If Zane thought his partner was showing vulnerability, he\u2019d fall for it every time. It was an amazingly predictable habit for his unpredictable partner. And there was more than a grain of truth in the words. \u201cCome on,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Looking faintly surprised, Zane got on the elevator and stood next to him, waiting for an explanation. Ty remained silent, enjoying watching the other man struggle with the fact that he would have to ask for it. Zane actually lasted almost the entire elevator ride to the parking garage before he huffed softly. \u201cFine,\u201d he said grudgingly. \u201cWhat do you need me for?\u201d</p> <p>Ty smirked as he looked over at Zane, but the smile faded as he cleared his throat. \u201cIf I\u2019m going home, I need something bigger than me to hide behind,\u201d he said as he gestured to Zane\u2019s larger frame.</p><p>\u201cThat actually did work out pretty well for me in the end last time,\u201d Zane drawled, raising an eyebrow. He was obviously remembering the night after the trip to Quantico.</p><p>Ty let his eyes rake over the man suggestively. \u201cYou have other uses too,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d Zane said slowly, smiling a little at Ty\u2019s playful words. \u201cTo West by-God Virginia? And you want me to just... tag along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty answered with a curt nod. That was exactly what he wanted. If Zane could survive a trip to West Virginia to meet the Gradys, he could live through anything. Like a cockroach.</p><p>An amused smile slowly pulled at Zane\u2019s lips as the elevator doors opened onto the parking deck. \u201cJust what is it you\u2019re afraid of?\u201d</p><p>Ty pursed his lips and waited a moment before moving out of the elevator without bothering to answer.</p><p>Zane huffed quietly and followed him. \u201cGrady, you\u2019re going to answer my question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to sprout wings and fly,\u201d Ty shot back over his shoulder. \u201cDo you have camping gear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamping... why the hell would I need camping gear in DC?\u201d Zane asked, throwing up a hand. \u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are places to camp in DC,\u201d Ty answered as he headed for his Bronco.</p><p>\u201cYeah, if you\u2019re homeless in a city park,\u201d Zane retorted. \u201cAnswer the question, Grady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Ty said to him with a smirk he tried to hide. He seriously enjoyed riling Zane up. The results were often... heated. \u201cI mean, if you want specific places to camp, I\u2019m gonna need a map. And maybe some squeaky pens, you know, the ones that smell good?\u201d he rambled, knowing it would annoy Zane and trying not to smile as he said it.</p><p>Zane stopped in place as Ty kept walking. After a long moment he shook his head and changed directions, heading for the far side of the parking garage. Zane had learned not long after they\u2019d been reassigned that he didn\u2019t have to stick around to deal with Ty\u2019s verbal sparring. In some ways it was a nuisance, because now Ty had to work harder to annoy him, but it was refreshing, too, in that Zane wasn\u2019t willing to be batted around like a mouse being taunted by a cat anymore.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Ty called after him with a melancholy smile. He did miss the verbal sparring sometimes.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane yelled back as he kept walking to his Valkyrie, parked in the corner about thirty yards away.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know why I don\u2019t like going home?\u201d Ty asked as he jangled his keys, the sound echoing in the cement parking garage.</p><p>\u201cI believe I asked what you were afraid of, Grady. Two different things,\u201d Zane responded as he picked up his helmet from the seat of the motorcycle. His voice bounded off the concrete of the parking deck and reached Ty almost as an echo.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid of the dark,\u201d Ty answered immediately with a tilt of his head, his voice soft and serious.</p><p>Zane paused and turned back to study him. Ty smiled slightly. They were both still dealing with hangups and problems. While Zane certainly had a harder time dealing than Ty did, every once in a while it did Zane good to be reminded that he wasn\u2019t alone in his struggles.</p><p>\u201cYou really want me to come?\u201d Zane asked him uncertainly.</p><p>Ty nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do while we\u2019re there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat home cooking and take a little hike in the woods,\u201d Ty answered with a negligent shrug.</p><p>Zane\u2019s shoulders relaxed. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between a little hike and needing camping gear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there?\u201d Ty asked innocently. He shook his head. \u201cWe just go up on the mountain. Stay there a week, maybe ten days,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cTen days,\u201d Zane repeated flatly.</p><p>\u201cSometimes less,\u201d Ty answered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to the mountains,\u201d Zane said doubtfully as he set his helmet down.</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to go,\u201d Ty countered, though he was silently wondering how in the hell Zane had lived all his life without going into the mountains. Any mountains.</p><p>Zane nodded slowly. \u201cAre we still getting coffee?\u201d he asked after a moment.</p><p>\u201cIf you want it,\u201d Ty answered with a shrug. \u201cWe need to go shopping. You\u2019re gonna need some boots,\u201d he told his partner with relish.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>IT WAS warm enough that they could leave the windows of Ty\u2019s Bronco down as they drove along the winding roads that led to Bluefield, West Virginia. The fall leaves had turned, making the road a blinding corridor of oranges, yellows, and reds. And even though the sun had just barely risen, the sky was an amazingly clear blue as they headed higher into the Appalachian Mountains.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t say much as he drove. He didn\u2019t even have the radio on. He was obviously distracted, resting his head in his hand as he propped his elbow on the open window. Even behind the dark aviator sunglasses and the mangled straw bullrider-style hat that sat low on his head, shielding his face, he was frowning unconsciously. He\u2019d purposely taken the scenic route, avoiding the highways as much as possible, but he got more and more tense as they got closer to their destination.</p><p>Zane was distracted as well, but more by the scenery than by his thoughts or by his companion\u2019s mood. He\u2019d never been up in the mountains, and while Texas had trees, it didn\u2019t have trees like this. Trees in every direction, up the mountains, down the mountains, as far as the eye could see.</p><p>He frowned and shifted his jaw from side to side, trying to pop his ears. \u201cI need gum,\u201d he muttered, looking over to Ty. \u201cYou could have warned me. I didn\u2019t even think about altitude change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold your nose and try to blow air through it,\u201d Ty advised seriously.</p><p>Zane peered at him, trying to decide if he was joking. With Ty, it was usually a safe bet that he was jerking him around, no matter how serious he sounded. But since his partner still looked as distracted as before, Zane decided to try it. And damn if it didn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cDoes it all look like this?\u201d he asked as he pulled at his ears. \u201cAll the trees and sky and nothing else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sky is usually there, yeah,\u201d Ty answered with a firm nod. \u201cSo are the trees, come to think of it,\u201d he added thoughtfully.</p><p>Zane thwacked him, earning a surprised, \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at him and grumbled as he rubbed his chest. Grinning, Zane shifted in the seat to extend his legs across the floorboard as they drove into the town of Bluefield. It wasn\u2019t what Zane had expected. It was large and fairly modern, nestled in a valley and sprawling across a gently rolling landscape. There were sections that were older and slightly dilapidated, but for the most part it looked like Bluefield was doing pretty well.</p><p>They drove through the Main Street area, historic buildings that had been rejuvenated and hosted little boutique shops and caf\u00e9s. An old man on the corner of the street waved at Ty as they drove past, apparently recognizing the Bronco, and Ty raised his hand out the window and grinned as he waved in return.</p><p>Zane was smiling slightly as Ty took the truck through several turns. Then they were heading further up the mountain. Zane\u2019s brow furrowed as he watched the rustic scenery pass, and he asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t play banjo, do you?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked over at him quickly, shock written plainly on his face even behind the sunglasses. \u201cDid Dick tell you that?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Zane stared at him for a moment and then broke down laughing. \u201cOh hell, no. I was just making a Deliverance joke!\u201d</p><p>Ty glared at him for as long as he was able before he was forced to look back at the road. \u201cI learned when I was little,\u201d he finally said defensively. \u201cBanjo, fiddle, guitar. The whole family plays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Zane said once he calmed down a little, though he couldn\u2019t resist another snicker. That just seemed out of character for tough guy Marine Ty Grady. It was almost charming.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty muttered. \u201cAnd FYI, Deliverance took place in Georgia. In West Virginia we kiss our cousins.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed softly. Soon they were out of the city, climbing even further up into the mountains. He had to yawn a couple times to pop his ears again.</p><p>Another five minutes and they were turning off the paved two-lane and heading up a winding dirt road. Ty was getting more and more fidgety, shifting in his seat as he put the Bronco through its paces. Just when it looked like the road might be tapering off into rugged wilderness, Ty turned onto a narrow gravel drive that seemed to go straight up into the heart of a mountain. He glanced at Zane again and smiled. \u201cYou can get a car up here, but you better hope the weather sticks.\u201d Then he frowned and slowed the truck further. \u201cHere we go,\u201d he murmured as they topped the steep incline and a house came into view.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips compressed. Ty was still edgy, and it was getting to him. He leaned forward to look out the windshield at what awaited them.</p><p>The house was a classic old farmhouse, but well-kept, with a stone foundation, white siding, dormer windows on the second story, bright red shutters, and a matching tin roof. A porch wrapped around the entire front and side of the house, complete with an array of old rocking chairs and oversized stairs leading up to the front door. The outbuildings were in worse shape, the paint peeling slightly on the clapboard frames; some of them tilted precariously. Several of them were nothing but cedar beams and tin, while a few were cinderblock and much sturdier.</p><p>In the gravel driveway were four other vehicles: a crew cab Ford F-150, a Chevy Blazer, an old Ford Ranger, and a brand new black Lexus coupe. Ty parked beside the Lexus and cocked his head, peering at it curiously.</p><p>A man drew Zane\u2019s attention when he came out onto the porch, pushing through the screen door and shielding his eyes as he stepped into the morning sun. He was young, much too young to be Ty\u2019s father. He still bore a striking resemblance to Ty, though his hair was a little longer and lighter, and he was taller and thinner. He had to be Ty\u2019s brother. The man thumped down the stairs, walking with a pronounced limp, and Ty opened up his door and slid out of the Bronco as he came closer.</p><p>Taking his cue from Ty, Zane got out as well but stood just inside the door as he looked around at the towering trees that surrounded them. He tore his eyes away from them to watch Ty approach the house. He felt like he should hang back for now, at least until after the reunion.</p><p>Ty grinned as he and his brother embraced. He gave the man an affectionate pat on his cheek and then turned and gestured for Zane to come closer.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout time y\u2019all got here,\u201d Ty\u2019s brother said to them.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty grunted at him. \u201cZane, this is my brother, Deacon,\u201d he said with a wave of his hand at his brother. \u201cThis is Zane Garrett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Zane Garrett, I assume,\u201d Deacon said with emphasis as he stepped forward and took Zane\u2019s hand, pumping it hard. His voice wasn\u2019t as deep as Ty\u2019s, but it still had that gravelly, drawling quality to it that Zane liked. \u201cYou can call me Deuce.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, Deuce,\u201d Zane agreed. He liked him already; he seemed like a friendlier version of Ty. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikewise,\u201d Deuce drawled, grinning. \u201cCome on in,\u201d he invited as he turned and threw his arm around Ty\u2019s shoulders. \u201cMom\u2019s fluttering,\u201d he said to his brother, trying unsuccessfully not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cAs long as she\u2019s cooking while she\u2019s doing it,\u201d Ty muttered. \u201cI\u2019m starving. Did you get a new car again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty answered candidly with a shake of his head and a glance back at the Lexus.</p><p>\u201cIt has Bluetooth,\u201d Deuce answered with a grin, unperturbed. Ty groaned and shook his head.</p><p>Zane walked up the steps behind them, rubbing his hands together to ward off the slight morning chill. He\u2019d pulled the jacket off when they\u2019d gotten in the truck at the last rest stop. He\u2019d known it would be cooler up here, but it had to be a good twenty degrees cooler here than in DC. He spared another look around and shook his head. It was so totally different from any other place he\u2019d been\u2014Washington, LA, Baltimore, New York. Texas. Especially Miami.</p><p>Ty stopped at the door and looked back at him. \u201cWelcome to West Virginia,\u201d he murmured as he held the screen door open. The smell of frying bacon and fresh bread wafted out to them.</p> <p>Zane nodded and followed Ty inside, where it was quite a bit warmer, and the smell of the bread made his stomach growl. \u201cOh Lord. Fresh-baked bread.\u201d</p><p>Ty sniffed at the air as he tromped through the house toward the back, where the dining room opened up into a large kitchen. \u201cMorning,\u201d he greeted as he stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>The woman at the stove turned and smiled widely. Ty went over to her and hugged her close, kissing her on the cheek as she patted his back without letting go of the spatula in her hand. She was a tall woman, the top of her head hitting past Ty\u2019s broad shoulders, and her round face was almost devoid of wrinkles until she smiled. Her graying hair had once been the same color as Ty\u2019s, and her eyes were a bright, striking green.</p><p>She stepped back from Ty and took his face in her hands, the spatula smacking against his temple. \u201c\u2019Bout time you got here,\u201d she said to him. She looked over Ty\u2019s shoulder at Zane and smiled again. \u201cYou must be Zane,\u201d she said as she unceremoniously pushed Ty aside. She went up to Zane and pulled him into a hug as well, just like he was another son she hadn\u2019t seen in some time.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, and after a beat he halfway closed his arms around her, not sure what to do. \u201cUh. Hi,\u201d he said weakly, patting her shoulder gently.</p><p>\u201cZane Garrett, Mara Grady,\u201d Ty introduced with a smirk as he met Zane\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Zane said as she patted his back, oblivious to his discomfort. Then she turned away and bopped Ty in the head with her spatula.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Ty protested with a surprised laugh.</p><p>\u201cShoulda been home months ago,\u201d she scolded. \u201cSit down, Zane dear, breakfast is almost ready,\u201d she said in a much sweeter voice.</p><p>Zane swallowed a laugh, although he didn\u2019t even try to hide his smile. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, pulling out a chair on the far side of the table next to the wall so he\u2019d be out of the way.</p><p>Ty sat down opposite him, grumbling. \u201cYou got bacon grease in my hair,\u201d he said to his mother as he rubbed at his head.</p><p>\u201cServes you right,\u201d Mara responded. She tossed the spatula into the sink and fished out another from a nearby drawer.</p><p>Deuce sat next to Zane and plopped an empty glass in front of each of them, snickering softly and avoiding meeting his brother\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d Ty asked as he made a rude gesture at Deuce. Zane could feel his smile grow wider.</p> <p>\u201cWent up to the mine early this morning; someone called about some kids messing with the gates,\u201d Deuce answered. At the mention of the mine, Ty tensed visibly, and he nodded and looked toward the back door uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s gone much longer,\u201d his mother said to them, \u201cI want you boys to go fetch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d both brothers answered in automatic response. Zane had seen Ty snap to attention for Dick Burns before. He\u2019d always assumed it was some latent response from his military training. But it clearly went back further than that.</p><p>He also noticed Ty\u2019s reaction to hearing about the mine, and he remembered what little Ty had told him about growing up here. Ty had always been scared of the mines, afraid of something happening to his father while he was there, and terrified of being trapped in them himself. After his experience in New York and being buried in a dark hole where he thought he\u2019d never see light again, the thought of going into those mines now had to be outright terrifying. Zane had to admit Ty hid it well.</p><p>Mara set down a platter overflowing with biscuits, warm slices of fresh bread, bacon, and sausage links. Then she set down a bowl of grits, two jars of what looked like homemade jam, and two pitchers of orange juice. Last came a bowl full of scrambled eggs.</p><p>She tapped Ty in the back of the head as he reached for a piece of bacon. \u201cManners,\u201d she reminded as she wiped her hands on her apron before beginning to untie it. \u201cYou go ahead and load up, Zane, you\u2019re going to need a full stomach to deal with these two all day,\u201d Mara advised.</p><p>Zane nodded but stood up. \u201cI need to take a quick break first. We didn\u2019t stop much during the drive,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cOut that door and first tree to the left,\u201d Deuce told him as he pointed at the back door.</p><p>\u201cPut a sock in it, Deacon,\u201d Mara scolded. \u201cIt\u2019s the door under the stairs, dear,\u201d she told Zane as she sat at the head of the table.</p><p>As he walked out of the kitchen in the direction she\u2019d pointed, Zane got a better glimpse of the rest of the house. It was a typical old farmhouse with scuffed hardwood floors covered by handmade rag rugs. The plaster walls were covered with neatly framed black-and-white photographs; some of them had to be a hundred years old, and some of them were new enough that Ty was wearing his FBI windbreaker in one.</p><p>Zane looked at a few of them, stopping for a little longer when he found a photo of Ty in uniform. He looked much younger, and while it was the same hard, unsmiling face he\u2019d seen in every Marine\u2019s photo, there was a hint of something in the hazel eyes that Zane didn\u2019t think he\u2019d seen in Ty before. He couldn\u2019t quite place it. The man did look good in a uniform, that was for sure.</p><p>Zane stared at it for a long time before pulling himself away and going to find the staircase.</p><p>\u201cGrandpa!\u201d Zane heard Ty exclaim in a pleased voice from the kitchen.</p><p>Zane shut the door with a smile. About five minutes, later he stood in the doorway of the kitchen again. An old man had joined the table, and he sat next to Ty, holding his hand and patting it affectionately.</p><p>\u201cGrandpa, this is my partner, Zane,\u201d Ty said as soon as Zane sat. \u201cZane, Chester Grady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI agent, huh?\u201d the old man said to Zane with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cMost of the time,\u201d Zane admitted.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t hold that against you,\u201d Chester said. \u201cYet,\u201d he promised.</p><p>Zane arched an eyebrow at the old man. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehave, you old goat,\u201d Mara chastised. \u201cWe\u2019ll start without your daddy,\u201d she told the rest of them with a frown. \u201cHe better be stuck in a hole somewhere,\u201d she grumbled as she bowed her head.</p><p>Zane glanced around the table as he slowly crossed his hands, figuring a prayer was coming, and his eyes stuck on Ty, who looked even more tense than before.</p><p>\u201cOne of you say grace,\u201d Mara ordered after waiting for one of the brothers to take the lead. Ty looked up, meeting Zane\u2019s eyes. He opened his mouth to speak, but the screen door creaked and interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cThose damn kids are gonna blow themselves up down there,\u201d the man who entered pronounced as he shrugged out of his jacket and hung it on a hook beside the door. \u201cMorning, boys,\u201d he said, as if having his sons there for breakfast was nothing unusual.</p><p>\u201cMorning, sir,\u201d both men responded in unison.</p><p>\u201cDad, this is Zane Garrett,\u201d Ty added with a nod to his partner. \u201cZane, Earl Grady,\u201d he introduced as Ty\u2019s father came over and patted Ty on the shoulder in greeting.</p><p>Earl was an imposing man, tall and broad-shouldered. The man made Ty look like the runt of the litter. His graying hair was cut short and neat, and he was clean-shaven and almost as devoid of wrinkles as his wife. Zane decided it must be the altitude.</p><p>Earl reached across the table to offer his callused hand to Zane. \u201cHello, sir,\u201d Zane greeted as he stood to shake Earl\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cGood to meet you, son,\u201d Earl responded as he shook Zane\u2019s hand. His voice was deep and gravelly, with the same twanging, almost hoarse quality Ty\u2019s was apt to have at times. His accent was more pronounced. \u201cTy has told us absolutely nothing about you,\u201d he informed Zane as he sat at the other end of the table, opposite his wife.</p><p>Zane\u2019s brows rose. He was mildly surprised, first by being addressed as \u201cson\u201d and second by Earl\u2019s comment about his presence. \u201cAh.\u201d He looked to his partner sitting across the table from him. \u201cYou did tell them I was coming, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty answered defensively.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t you worry, dear,\u201d his mother said with a pat of Zane\u2019s hand. \u201cEarl, say grace so Zane doesn\u2019t starve,\u201d she ordered. She bowed her head again as Earl said a few words over the food, and then as soon as he was done she lifted her head and started passing around the dishes. \u201cEat up,\u201d she invited.</p><p>Giving Ty a dubious glare, Zane picked up the serving fork and started filling his plate and then offered the platter to Deuce, who took it with a murmur of thanks and dished out his own breakfast before passing it to his father.</p><p>\u201cSo Zane, Richard tells me you two have had some interesting times,\u201d Earl Grady said as he took the platter.</p><p>\u201cRichard? Richard... Burns?\u201d Zane asked, his fork pausing over his plate. Earl looked up from his plate and raised one eyebrow. \u201cInteresting times,\u201d Zane quickly answered. \u201cIf you were reading about them, I guess,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cReading about them,\u201d Earl repeated as his eyes traveled to Ty. \u201cThat what you been doing, son? Sitting behind a desk and reading about them?\u201d he asked his son.</p><p>Ty sighed and sat forward to lean his elbows on the table. \u201cDad, don\u2019t be silly,\u201d he said with practiced patience and sarcasm. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t read,\u201d he assured his father.</p><p>Earl smiled slowly before passing the platter on around to Chester. \u201cYou like desk work, Zane?\u201d he asked, his voice still mildly curious.</p><p>Zane screwed up his face in distaste. \u201cI\u2019ve done more than my fair share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarl, leave the boys alone,\u201d Mara ordered.</p><p>\u201cHell, Mara, I\u2019m just being friendly,\u201d Earl protested.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re interrogating them,\u201d Mara corrected. \u201cEat your bacon,\u201d she ordered. She patted Ty on the head protectively as he took the platter from Chester and started scooping food onto to his plate. He didn\u2019t even react to the gesture.</p><p>Zane wondered if Ty was a mama\u2019s boy. He tipped his head to the side, watching them as he picked out a piece of warm bread, and thought maybe so. Not that he would ever voice that opinion to Ty until he was good and ready to die. He supposed, though, with a father as imposing as Earl Grady seemed to be, his sons would need a protective and loving mother. With a soft hum, he started picking up jelly jars and examining them.</p><p>\u201cThat there\u2019s plum jelly, and the other\u2019s cherry, honey, you help yourself,\u201d Mara told him. \u201cYou like hiking, Zane? I\u2019ve never met one of the boys\u2019 friends who could keep up with them on the mountain,\u201d she went on cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t done much hiking, I\u2019m afraid, unless you count running around out on the flats,\u201d Zane said as he peered into the jars and finally chose the cherry. \u201cAnd that was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Earl and Mara both stopped what they were doing and looked at him in surprise. Chester began to laugh delightedly as he continued eating. Zane glanced among them, waiting for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been out on the trail?\u201d Earl asked dubiously.</p><p>\u201cSure I have. Just not in the mountains,\u201d Zane said, glancing between Earl and Ty.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine, Dad,\u201d Deuce said through a mouthful of food. \u201cIf I can do it, so can he,\u201d he pointed out with a tap of his knuckles on the table.</p><p>\u201cGonna be cold out there,\u201d Chester interjected gleefully.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you boys should think about not going,\u201d Mara said. She sounded worried.</p><p>\u201cZane\u2019ll be fine, Ma,\u201d Ty assured her, unconcerned as he looked at Zane. Zane shrugged with one shoulder, not sure what Ty wanted him to say. Ty cocked his head and gave him a quick wink, and Zane gave him a small smile in response.</p><p>\u201cWell, Zane, you must have proved yourself somehow,\u201d Earl observed wryly. \u201cThe last person Ty took on the mountain was Recon. And we carried his ass back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got bit by a snake, dad,\u201d Ty said in protest.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, you told the dumbass not to poke it,\u201d Earl argued. Ty pressed his lips together tightly, trying not to laugh as he looked back at Zane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m betting it\u2019s cool enough not too many snakes will be out,\u201d Zane said dryly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll do my best not to poke them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d Earl said with a nod. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cProbably don\u2019t want to poke at the wild boar either,\u201d Deuce added helpfully. \u201cOr the bats. Or the bears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like lions and tigers and bears, oh my,\u201d Zane said as he helped himself to more scrambled eggs.</p><p>\u201cBears, sure. Lots of coyotes. And you just might see yourself a lion if you\u2019re really lucky,\u201d Earl said while he buttered a piece of toast.</p> <p>\u201cWe have varying definitions of lucky,\u201d Deuce interjected.</p><p>\u201cSeen a black panther out there once,\u201d Chester offered, unconcerned.</p><p>\u201cWas that through the end of a moonshine jug?\u201d Ty asked him with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cWatch that tongue, sonny,\u201d Chester warned with a wag of his crooked finger in Ty\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cBetter if you plan to restrict your poking,\u201d Deuce told Zane helpfully. \u201cLots of endangered animals up here aside from Ty. Snails. Peregrines and a lot of other birds, mostly. And a salamander.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the freshwater mussel,\u201d Ty drawled.</p><p>Deuce toasted him with his orange juice. \u201cAnd the freshwater mussel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you even know where to walk?\u201d Zane asked flatly. Ty rolled his eyes and waved Zane off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan today?\u201d Deuce asked Ty as they ate.</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cHaven\u2019t really got that far,\u201d he answered. \u201cWhat about you, Garrett? Got anything you wanna do before we take you up there and leave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep?\u201d Zane suggested, ignoring the playful threat. \u201cOr something equally relaxing. We\u2019re supposed to be on vacation, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVacation?\u201d Deuce asked in surprise. \u201cI thought you used up all your vacation already.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked at him, pursing his lips. The two brothers stared at each other expectantly for a tense moment. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about it,\u201d Ty said finally.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d Deuce assured him gratefully as he went back to eating.</p><p>\u201cTalk about what?\u201d Mara asked distractedly.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Ty insisted.</p><p>\u201cTy and his partner are on punishment,\u201d Earl told her, frowning. Zane\u2019s head popped up in surprise.</p><p>\u201cDid Dick tell you that?\u201d Ty demanded angrily.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ty, I figured that one out all by myself,\u201d Earl answered with a tap to the side of his head. Eyes darting from side to side, Zane leaned back a little out of the line of fire.</p> <p>\u201cIf you two are gonna fight, you take it outside,\u201d Mara told them, unaffected by the suddenly tense atmosphere. \u201cZane, honey, how long have you been with the Bureau?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA little over twenty years, ma\u2019am,\u201d Zane said hesitantly.</p><p>\u201dYou\u2019d think twenty years would get you better than Ty,\u201d Deuce muttered as he reached for the orange juice.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Zane drew out, smiling a little, \u201cno. Afraid not.\u201d</p><p>Ty glared at them both. Earl watched Zane with his head slightly cocked. He had the same quality Ty did, the one that always made it look like he knew something more than he was letting on.</p><p>\u201cI believe it was more Ty getting stuck with me than me getting stuck with him,\u201d Zane clarified as Ty gave him a gesture that probably meant for him to shut the hell up.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Deuce asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cI was transferred from another division, and Assistant Director Burns dumped me on him with no warning,\u201d Zane said, trying to talk around it enough that Ty might not kick his ass later.</p><p>\u201cSo you consider each other punishment?\u201d Deuce asked as he set his elbow on the table and leaned forward in interest.</p><p>No way was Zane touching that one. He\u2019d let Ty throw the first insult.</p><p>Ty wagged his fork in his brother\u2019s direction. \u201cStop psychoanalyzing us,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s my job,\u201d Deuce protested.</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted to see a shrink, I\u2019d go to the one Dick told me to,\u201d Ty told him. Zane did a double take between the brothers.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need a shrink?\u201d Earl asked Ty.</p><p>\u201cWe really don\u2019t like to be called shrinks,\u201d Deuce informed them in annoyance.</p><p>Zane\u2019s chin turned toward Deuce. \u201cYou\u2019re a shrink?\u201d was out of his mouth before he could stop it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a psychiatrist, yes,\u201d Deuce answered. \u201cTy didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cI know as little or less about you all than you know about me. I didn\u2019t even know Ty had a brother \u2019til this morning.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s fork clattered into his plate, and he held up his hand. \u201cCan we stop sharing, please?\u201d he requested in frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need a shrink?\u201d Earl asked him again.</p><p>\u201cI have daddy issues,\u201d Ty answered with a smirk.</p><p>Earl pointed his fork at him and narrowed his eyes as he chewed, though there was a hint of amusement in his expression. It seemed all of them enjoyed brandishing that quick wit. If Zane weren\u2019t so off balance, it would have almost been fun to see Ty bested by someone else.</p><p>\u201cIf Richard said you needed a shrink, then you need a shrink,\u201d Mara told Ty with certainty.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a shrink,\u201d Ty insisted with a gesture of his hand to calm his mother.</p><p>\u201cWe really don\u2019t like to be called shrinks,\u201d Deuce repeated again in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you\u2019re lucky that\u2019s all we call you,\u201d Mara told Deuce as she dished out more grits.</p><p>Ty snorted, and Deuce grumbled at them both.</p><p>\u201cI think Burns just enjoys yanking us around,\u201d Zane said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t enjoy much about either of you lately, son,\u201d Earl told him, growing serious once more.</p><p>Zane glanced up at him, surprised. He wondered what the two men could legally even talk about. Ty\u2014maybe. But certainly not himself, except in the most general of terms. With a quick look, he saw that Ty wasn\u2019t paying him any attention. His eyes were closed, and he was pinching the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d Zane said significantly. He hated the thought of someone checking up on him without his knowledge. Especially if it was someone who might really care and be upset by hearing about Zane\u2019s ups and downs. He could imagine that Ty didn\u2019t like the idea, either.</p><p>Ty opened his eyes and looked at Zane through his fingers as he covered his face with his hand. He shrugged helplessly, as if to say he had absolutely no control over what was happening. Zane wrinkled his nose and resisted the urge to reach across the table and smack him one for being absolutely no help. Instead he turned his attention back to Earl. \u201cJust how well do you know Assistant Director Burns, Mr. Grady?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to call me Earl, son. And I\u2019ve known Richard for almost forty years,\u201d Earl answered. \u201cWe went into Vietnam together, and we came out together,\u201d he said with a hint of pride.</p><p>Very good friends, then. Zane sighed and sat back. Earl might not know much of anything about him. But he also might know more than Zane would want to admit to anyone, much less Ty\u2019s father, of all people. He leveled his eyes on his partner and waited.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked defensively. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d he protested as Earl chuckled.</p><p>Zane felt his lips curl up. It was actually amusing to see Ty\u2019s reactions to his family. \u201cWhat isn\u2019t he enjoying about us?\u201d he asked, going back to Earl\u2019s first comment.</p><p>Earl shrugged as he handed his plate to his wife, who was now rounding the table collecting dishes. \u201cApparently you\u2019re making him do more paperwork than he wants to be doing. He mentioned something about throwing handguns and blue paint,\u201d he said with a bemused frown. Ty snorted and covered the laugh with a cough. Earl looked at him with narrowed eyes and then back at Zane. Zane was hard-pressed not to chuckle. \u201cHe also told me he was worried about you both,\u201d Earl continued. \u201cHe\u2019s always worried about Ty, but him saying he\u2019s worried about Ty\u2019s partner is new,\u201d he informed Zane as he studied him closely. \u201cTy usually takes care of his partners.\u201d</p><p>Zane automatically handed his plate up when Mara held her hand out for it, but he kept his eyes on Earl, not sure if there was more to hear.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s he worried?\u201d Earl asked him pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Ty said in warning, but Earl continued to look at Zane expectantly.</p><p>After a long moment of silent standoff, Zane just shrugged one shoulder. He didn\u2019t know what the man wanted him to say. Anything he could think of was far too personal. Earl\u2019s eyes transferred from Zane to Ty without a word. Ty merely raised an eyebrow at him and bit into a piece of bacon with a loud crunch, obviously more immune to the gaze than Zane was.</p><p>Deuce gave Zane\u2019s arm a gentle pat, and he scooted his chair back noisily. \u201cCome on, Zane, I\u2019ll show you the mountain,\u201d he offered under his breath.</p><p>Zane glanced to Ty before moving to follow Deuce out. His partner was on his own with this one, and Zane wanted out from under Earl\u2019s knowing eyes before he said something he shouldn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t really Earl\u2019s reaction he was worried about. Zane didn\u2019t have to go home with him.</p><p>They went through the back door, which was the nearest exit, and Deuce had to grip the railing as he thumped down the old wooden steps that led into the back yard. The grassy part of the yard rolled slightly and then dropped off suddenly into a deep ravine just twenty yards from the back of the house. The thick woods started at the edge of the far side, seeming to enclose the area with a wall of trees. Deuce took a few steps toward the ravine and waved at the land beyond it. \u201cAnd there\u2019s the mountain,\u201d he told Zane with a small smile.</p><p>Zane took a deep breath of the clean air and gave him a smile. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said with a nod.</p><p>Deuce waved him off. \u201cDon\u2019t let Dad get to you,\u201d he advised. \u201cIf you can deal with Ty, Dad should be a cakewalk for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about offending Ty,\u201d Zane answered. \u201cAlthough I do have to work with him, so I try not to piss him off too badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fair plan. And Dad isn\u2019t easily offended,\u201d Deuce told him with a smile. \u201cWhat are you worried he knows about?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t exactly have the best track record in the Bureau,\u201d Zane said quietly as he looked around at the trees.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still in it, though, and I know Ty doesn\u2019t rate second-hand partners,\u201d Deuce countered.</p><p>Zane would have answered in the affirmative, but he wasn\u2019t quite sure if he really fit the bill. \u201cI guess I\u2019m a little off balance,\u201d he said vaguely, gesturing to the surroundings.</p><p>\u201cHigh altitudes will do that,\u201d Deuce replied, the sarcasm practically dripping from the words.</p><p>\u201cYou talk like him,\u201d Zane said wryly, hearing the smartass echo in Deuce\u2019s voice that so reminded him of Ty.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d Deuce asked in interest.</p><p>\u201cThat tone of voice,\u201d Zane said, fixing his eyes intently on Deuce. \u201cTy sounds like that all the time. Droll. Like he\u2019s humoring me.\u201d</p><p>Deuce laughed. \u201cI apologize,\u201d he offered with an open, honest grin.</p><p>Zane\u2019s smile was more genuine this time. \u201cI\u2019d say you don\u2019t know how annoying that can be, but....\u201d Deuce laughed harder as the screen door creaked behind them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to start slipping Dad Valium or something,\u201d Ty muttered as he joined them. He handed Deuce a thick cigar that he\u2019d had hidden in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cCuban?\u201d Deuce asked in delight.</p><p>\u201cCuban,\u201d Ty answered with a nod as Deuce slid the cigar under his nose and sniffed it.</p><p>Zane frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t earned illegal Cubans yet,\u201d Ty informed him seriously.</p><p>\u201cEarned?\u201d Zane asked, voice rising toward the end. He looked at Deuce and jerked his thumb toward Ty. \u201cSee? This is what I deal with almost every day.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cEarned,\u201d he muttered, shoving his hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cI thought acting as a human paintball shield qualified you for illegal Cubans?\u201d Deuce asked Ty in an innocent voice. Ty began snickering before he\u2019d even finished speaking.</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes. \u201cI still have bruises,\u201d he said plaintively.</p><p>\u201cBoo hoo,\u201d Ty offered. \u201cYou smoke too much for cigars,\u201d he reasoned.</p><p>Zane shrugged at Ty\u2019s logic. He was used to it by now. \u201cBetter hope no one with a grudge catches you with one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has a grudge,\u201d Ty told him with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cMy brother has no morals,\u201d Deuce sang lightly, and he cackled gleefully as he slid the cigar he\u2019d been given into his pocket.</p><p>Ty grunted at him. \u201cI\u2019m running low, and Charlie\u2019s getting discharged in three months, so enjoy it while it lasts,\u201d he told Deuce in a disgruntled growl.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to find some other shady character at Gitmo,\u201d Deuce counseled seriously. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go unpack some things and sit with Grandpa before he gets the shovel out,\u201d he added with a smirk. He gave Ty a pat on the arm before walking away, leaving them alone in the cold, fresh air.</p><p>\u201cShovel?\u201d Zane questioned.</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cLater,\u201d he promised.</p><p>Zane shifted his weight and tried to let the tension from breakfast go as he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and lit one up. He took in the sun rising above the trees, and there was a full minute of quiet before he spoke. \u201cYour family is... nice,\u201d he said with difficulty.</p><p>That caused Ty to start laughing. Hard.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>SOON enough, Ty was making his way around the house toward his Bronco to retrieve the bags of camping equipment they\u2019d brought with them. Zane remained in the back yard for a moment, finishing his cigarette in the cool, crisp air and looking around at the peaceful surroundings. For some reason, he couldn\u2019t imagine Ty having grown up here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His lips twitched. In the barn, maybe.</p><p>As he joined Ty at the truck, Zane caught sight of Chester sitting in a rocking chair on the porch, eyeing them silently. He also saw that the old man now held the aforementioned shovel across his thighs as he rocked.</p><p>Zane leaned over toward Ty. \u201cIs that the shovel?\u201d</p> <p>Ty hefted a bag out of the back of the Bronco and glanced up at the porch. \u201cYep,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cHe sleeps with it, too, so don\u2019t go sneaking around at night.\u201d</p><p>Zane took one of the bags. \u201cHe sleeps with it,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Ty hummed affirmatively. \u201cNot sure where he keeps it, but I can tell you with certainty that he wakes up swinging. He goes everywhere with it.\u201d He pointed to the old blue and white Ford Ranger that had a gun rack mounted in the back window. \u201cWhen he drives, there\u2019s a cane and his shovel in that thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that weird. I sleep with a gun,\u201d Zane said with a shrug, though he was bemused. \u201cYou used to sleep with any number of weapons. Why not a shovel?\u201d He paused and bit his lip. \u201cWhat kind of damage can he do with that thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroke my nose when I was fifteen,\u201d Ty answered with a fond smile. \u201cHe can hit a snake from ten yards away. Moving target\u2019s iffy since his eyesight started going,\u201d he added seriously.</p> <p>Zane couldn\u2019t stop the laugh. \u201cBroke your nose? What were you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSneaking in,\u201d Ty said unashamedly as he pulled out another heavy pack and thumped it on the ground. \u201cMe and Deuce. I was on point that night. Turned the corner and bang!\u201d he said as he waved his hand in front of his face.</p><p>Zane snickered. \u201cAfter curfew,\u201d he said knowingly.</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Ty said with a nod. He looked over to the house and smiled at his grandfather, who was rocking contentedly, the shovel held loosely in his fingers. \u201cGrandpa fought in the Pacific Theater in World War Two,\u201d he told Zane in a low voice. \u201cGrandma always said he came home with a shovel and never put it away.\u201d He glanced at Zane and shrugged. \u201cOn the Pacific islands, sometimes a shovel was a Marine\u2019s only defense from enemy fire. Dug for your life,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe always figured something broke up there,\u201d he said with a tap to his temple. \u201cThe shovel made him feel... whole.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded slowly as he picked up one of the bags and hung it on his right arm before picking up another. \u201cIt\u2019s great that you still have him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still here most of the time,\u201d Ty responded with a sigh. \u201cSometimes I think he\u2019s putting on just so he don\u2019t have to deal with us,\u201d he added with a smirk.</p> <p>\u201cLike I haven\u2019t seen that before,\u201d Zane said, nudging Ty in the ribs with this elbow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t play at crazy,\u201d Ty warned with a smirk he couldn\u2019t quite hide. He reached into the Bronco and dragged out one last bag, throwing it over his shoulder. Zane fixed a look of disbelief on his partner. \u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked angelically as he picked up the first bag and began heading for the house.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t play at being an asshole either,\u201d Zane informed him as he followed him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Ty agreed happily as he tromped across the yard with the bags.</p><p>\u201cOh, the things I could say,\u201d Zane muttered, reminding himself Ty\u2019s family was around.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Ty asked with a look over his shoulder. He was grinning widely, his hazel eyes sparkling in the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d Zane drawled, his heart skipping a beat or two. Ty was rarely in this mood lately. Not since New York, in fact. Ty winked at him and thumped up the steps.</p><p>\u201cHey, sonny,\u201d Chester said to him as he rocked. \u201cHow far\u2019s the trek this time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo far for you, old man,\u201d Ty grunted with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Chester said happily as he looked back out at the mountain and patted his shovel lovingly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll stay here and keep him company,\u201d Zane suggested. \u201cHe can protect me from the snakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t no snakes this time of year,\u201d Chester scoffed. \u201cDamn fool federal agents,\u201d he muttered sorrowfully with a shake of his head.</p><p>Zane chuckled. \u201cSorry. There\u2019s snakes year-round in Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett,\u201d Ty warned under his breath, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cDoes this look like Texas to you, son?\u201d Chester asked irritably. He easily picked up the weighty shovel with one gnarled hand and waved it in Zane\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Zane answered smartly, stepping a bit behind Ty. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to pay better attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmartass,\u201d Chester muttered as he returned his attention back to the view and began rocking again.</p><p>Ty reached behind him and patted Zane\u2019s hip, urging him to get inside as they sidestepped past. Zane cleared his throat as he allowed Ty to shuffle him inside. Ty just shook his head again and dropped the heavy bags inside the living room. \u201cDon\u2019t piss him off,\u201d he warned in a low voice as he headed for the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI think he puts on being pissed off to keep you in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt works,\u201d Ty returned immediately.</p><p>Zane chuckled, trying to keep it quiet. \u201cWow,\u201d he observed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked defensively.</p><p>\u201cIt just explains so much about you.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned to look at him, circling the kitchen table warily. \u201cHow?\u201d he asked in confusion.</p><p>Zane braced both hands on the tabletop and leaned toward him. \u201cIt\u2019s not just you. Your whole family\u2019s cracked, but somehow, you all make it work. That\u2019s so unfair.\u201d A hand slapped him hard on the back of the head just as he finished speaking. \u201cOw!\u201d His hand flew up to rub the sore spot.</p><p>Mara whisked past with a bushel of apples on her hip. \u201cBe nice,\u201d she chastised distractedly.</p><p>\u201cIt was a compliment!\u201d Zane protested as Ty laughed.</p><p>\u201cI know bullshit when I hear it, kiddo. I raised that one,\u201d Mara told him with a jerk of her thumb at Ty as she plunked the apples down on the table. \u201cGet out of my kitchen or help me,\u201d she ordered as she wiped her hands on her apron.</p><p>Ty went to the nearest cabinet and opened it, extracted a white tub labeled \u201cFlour\u201d from the highest shelf, and set it on the nearest counter. He gave his mom a kiss on the cheek and then promptly headed for the door. That was apparently all the help she\u2019d get.</p><p>Zane trailed after Ty into the living room. Ty flopped onto the couch and looked at him critically. \u201cShut up,\u201d Zane said as he sat opposite him in an armchair.</p><p>\u201cYou really think I\u2019m crazy?\u201d Ty asked him curiously.</p><p>\u201cCrazy, yes. Cuckoo off your rocker, no. There\u2019s a difference,\u201d Zane answered. \u201cAsk your brother,\u201d he tacked on. Ty raised an eyebrow at him.</p><p>\u201cAsk your brother what?\u201d Deuce called as he thumped down the stairs into the living room. He had changed clothes into something more appropriate for the mountains rather than driving from Philadelphia in a Lexus.</p><p>\u201cWhether I\u2019m crazy,\u201d Ty answered as he leaned back and slumped into the soft cushions.</p><p>\u201cCompletely certifiable,\u201d Deuce provided without looking at either of them as he examined a bowl full of peanuts on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between crazy and cuckoo off your rocker,\u201d Zane repeated.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Deuce agreed as he looked up at Ty and nodded. \u201cAre these Dad\u2019s?\u201d he whispered as he pointed at the peanuts. Ty merely nodded, not looking away from Deuce. Zane glanced between the two, interested in watching them interact. There didn\u2019t appear to be any rivalry. In fact, they seemed to be truly at ease with each other. Deuce deflated a little and abandoned the peanuts. He sat in the old wooden rocking chair near the fireplace and sighed heavily.</p><p>\u201cZane thinks we\u2019re all crazy,\u201d Ty told him with a smirk.</p><p>Deuce was nodding even before Ty finished speaking. \u201cRight on, brother,\u201d he said to Zane as he held his hand up in a fist and then smacked it down on the arm of the rocking chair.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Zane shrugged. \u201cI said it was a compliment. Deuce understands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a compliment,\u201d Deuce argued. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean it ain\u2019t true!\u201d he added cheerfully.</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but laugh and relax a little into the armchair. \u201cRefreshing.\u201d</p><p>Deuce cocked his head and studied Zane. He looked remarkably like Ty when he did it. The whole family, even Chester, was capable of the same expression, like they knew something about you and didn\u2019t plan on telling. The longer Deuce peered at him, the more Zane wondered what was up. \u201cSomething on your mind, Deuce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot usually,\u201d Deuce responded with a grin. \u201cI\u2019m just sort of curious,\u201d he added thoughtfully as he looked over at Ty. \u201cAbout you two,\u201d he clarified.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes slid to Ty to check his reaction. His partner had narrowed his eyes at his brother, but he was still smiling slightly, like they were about to play a game he enjoyed.</p><p>\u201cAnother interrogation?\u201d Zane said, amused. This could either go well... or not. There was potential for all sorts of questions Ty might not want answered for him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t interrogate,\u201d Deuce answered with an easy grin. \u201cThat\u2019s my brother\u2019s job. I just listen when you give me answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you listen very well,\u201d Zane allowed after a long moment\u2019s pause. But before he said anything else, he glanced over at Ty for some sort of comment.</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to dance around it. He knows.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s brows jumped. \u201cKnows... what... exactly?\u201d</p><p>Ty tilted his head and gave Zane a look that asked him not to make him explain. Zane leaned back into the chair and considered. He suspected Ty was talking about them fucking around. But if he wasn\u2019t....</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Deuce drew out with an obvious smile.</p><p>Zane took his time speculating how this conversation might go. Deuce merely smiled at him widely and rocked. Zane shook his head; he hated playing head games with shrinks. It took a lot of concentration that he just didn\u2019t want to muster. He was supposed to be on vacation, after all. \u201cI just might learn to dislike you,\u201d he said conversationally.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be the first, Slick,\u201d Deuce responded easily.</p><p>Even if he wanted to, Zane honestly didn\u2019t know if he could manipulate Deuce. The man was too much like Ty. Zane shifted in the armchair and shrugged. \u201cWhat are you curious about?\u201d</p><p>Deuce narrowed his eyes and glanced at Ty again. \u201cYou got him on the hook, man, ask away,\u201d Ty advised, smiling slightly.</p><p>Deuce nodded and glanced back at Zane speculatively. \u201cI think I got my answer. But we\u2019ll talk later,\u201d he decided as he pushed himself out of his chair. \u201cRight now I gotta see a man about a shovel,\u201d he said easily as he walked past and toward the front door.</p><p>His lips curving into a rueful smile, Zane watched the man walk out, knowing he\u2019d let himself be outplayed. Now, Deuce would know he could broach the subject at any time, and he knew Zane would have been thinking about it and dreading it all the while. \u201cGoody. Something to look forward to,\u201d he muttered before looking up at his partner.</p><p>Ty was watching his brother, smiling slightly as Deuce let the screen door bang shut. The look in his eyes was almost one of pride. \u201cPain in the ass, ain\u2019t he?\u201d he asked softly as he looked back at Zane.</p><p>\u201cLike someone else I know,\u201d Zane said pointedly, though he smiled to offset it. It was obvious Ty loved his brother very much. It was odd to find brothers just two years apart in age and not see at least one point of contention between them.</p><p>Ty shrugged unapologetically. \u201cHe\u2019s a hell of a lot smarter than I am,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d Zane said. Then the proverbial light bulb came on. He shifted his full attention to Ty. \u201cThat another reason you brought me here?\u201d he asked mildly. \u201cYour shrink brother?\u201d</p><p>Ty met his eyes and sighed. \u201cIf it was, would you be pissed?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The corners of Zane\u2019s lips turned up. \u201cProbably,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I suppose I\u2019d forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Ty grunted. \u201c\u2019Cause you caught me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too comfortable to kick your ass right now. Remind me, and I\u2019ll do it later,\u201d Zane said, leaning his head against the back of the chair, scooting his feet on the floor so his legs stretched out. Ty nodded agreeably, looking like he thought he might have dodged a bullet. But Zane wasn\u2019t ready to let him off the hook. \u201cWhat does your brother know?\u201d</p><p>Ty cleared his throat and looked toward the kitchen, where his mother was making quite a bit of racket as she prepared her pies. He stood and nodded for the front door. \u201cLet\u2019s take a walk,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Zane sighed before pushing himself up and out of the chair, and he gestured for Ty to lead the way. Ty pushed through the screen door and put a hand on Chester\u2019s shoulder in passing before clomping down the steps into the front yard. When they got into the soft grass, Zane started patting his pockets, looking for his cigarettes.</p><p>Ty shook his head and held out a pack, shaking it at Zane tauntingly. Zane grimaced and swiped at it. Ty easily evaded him and slid the pack into a hidden pocket inside his jacket. \u201cNo ruining my mountain air with cigarette smoke,\u201d he said sternly. He didn\u2019t hint at when, where, or how he\u2019d gotten Zane\u2019s cigarettes from him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane growled softly. \u201cAnd you can ruin it with cigar smoke? I\u2019m not even smoking half a pack a day,\u201d he reasoned. \u201cI could sure use one right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s to stress about?\u201d Ty asked easily. \u201cYou\u2019re on vacation, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about that question real hard, Grady. Put yourself in my place,\u201d Zane instructed. \u201cI\u2019m in a strange place with strange people, and I\u2019m really afraid I\u2019m going to say something wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t lie to my family, Zane,\u201d Ty murmured. \u201cAlthough if you tell anyone but Deuce that we\u2019re fucking there might be problems,\u201d he amended. He gave Zane a wry smile and shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019ll find out eventually. But not this weekend,\u201d he said good-naturedly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019d make normal dinner conversation out of,\u201d Zane said, wondering about the \u201ceventually\u201d comment. \u201cBut you can tell me why Deuce knows, when I didn\u2019t even know he existed until about... eight hours ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my brother,\u201d Ty answered seriously. \u201cWe have very few secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we do,\u201d Zane finished for him.</p><p>Ty opened his mouth to respond but closed it again with a sigh. His lips quirked in a smile. \u201cI wasn\u2019t keeping my brother a secret from you, Garrett,\u201d he said wryly.</p> <p>Zane jerked his head to the side in silent comment but was smiling slightly when he again made eye contact. \u201cThat\u2019s not a denial.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes. \u201cOf course we have secrets. Everyone does,\u201d he claimed as he turned and started walking again. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know that you keep your Maxims under your mattress, and you don\u2019t want to know that I cry when I watch Bambi. That\u2019s what makes partnerships work,\u201d he rambled with a wave of his hand.</p><p>A soft laugh forced its way out of Zane, and he shook his head at his partner. He raised a hand to stifle a sudden yawn. He\u2019d slept a few hours in the late afternoon yesterday, but not since then. Ty noticed it and sighed, stopping their walk and turning to veer back toward the house. He took Zane by the elbow first, though, and pulled him closer until their chests almost touched. \u201cTry to relax, huh?\u201d he said in a low voice. He just barely let his lips graze Zane\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun when you\u2019re tense,\u201d he whispered mischievously.</p><p>\u201cAh, but I am fun otherwise,\u201d Zane said as he smirked.</p><p>\u201cOnly when you\u2019re naked,\u201d Ty assured him as he stepped away. \u201cCome on. You can nap on the couch while Ma makes me and Deuce peel apples,\u201d he added, almost sounding as if he looked forward to the prospect.</p><p>TY HAD just left Zane on the couch and was heading for the door again to track down Deuce when Mara stuck her head out of the kitchen doorway.</p> <p>\u201cTy?\u201d she called after him. \u201cI need your help for just a minute,\u201d she requested before moving back into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna get you a stepstool for Christmas this year,\u201d Ty told her with a smile as he came into the kitchen behind her, obviously anticipating needing to get something off a high shelf for her.</p><p>Instead, Mara set out a plate and sat down in front of it, knowing Ty would sit opposite her. The plate was filled with rolled strips of leftover pie crust, baked and covered with cinnamon and sugar. She always made the little rolls out of her leftovers, and Ty had loved them since he had had to stand on a stool to see over the countertops.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Ty said with relish, and he reached out to grab one, popping it into his mouth as he pulled out a chair and sat down. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Ma?\u201d he asked in amusement. The roll was stuck in the side of his cheek like he was storing it for later.</p><p>Mara smiled fondly at him, but the smile fell quickly, and she frowned. \u201cYou brought your partner here to hide behind him,\u201d she observed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed and leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. He was silent as he chewed, either contemplating how to answer or planning on remaining silent until they were interrupted.</p><p>Mara knew how her son\u2019s mind worked, mostly. She didn\u2019t understand his deep love for that Bronco or his absolute hatred of the Yankees or his desire to go out on his days off and shoot paintballs at his buddies. But she did know her boy well enough to know that she wouldn\u2019t get answers out of him if he didn\u2019t want to give them.</p><p>Even before he\u2019d been trained by the Marines in case of capture, Ty had always been good at playing it close to the vest. If you found out something about him, he either wanted you to know it, someone else betrayed his confidence, or he was trying to get out of bigger trouble. The day he\u2019d come to her when he was eight years old and admitted he\u2019d broken a window with a baseball was also the same day she\u2019d discovered he\u2019d shot the oven with a BB gun.</p> <p>Her lips twitched as she remembered. She still had that BB gun in the top of her closet. He\u2019d never get that thing back.</p><p>Ty was looking at her speculatively, still trying to decide how or whether to answer. She took the opportunity to look him over with the critical eye of a mother. He looked worn and tense. His middle finger was slightly crooked, and she wondered how he\u2019d broken it. His wrists also had light scars all the way around each of them. She knew the origins of those marks only because Richard Burns had called them while Ty was in the hospital recovering from being chained to a wall and bricked into a hole by a serial killer. She wondered how many other scars her son had accumulated that she couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>Ty leaned back and sighed heavily. Finally, he shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been sort of... lost.\u201d He shook his head in frustration as he searched for the right words to explain. \u201cAnd Zane, he\u2019s not himself lately either,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with him or with me or how to help either of us. I guess I\u2019m hoping coming up here will give us some... answers.\u201d</p><p>Mara nodded in understanding. She didn\u2019t like to give advice, and she knew Ty would ask for it if he wanted it. Since he hadn\u2019t, she moved on to the one thing she knew always helped Ty when he was antsy. \u201cFeel like some hard work?\u201d she asked him hopefully.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Ty answered without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cGot a whole pile of wood needs chopping,\u201d Mara told him.</p><p>Ty was already standing. He grabbed several more of the crust rolls and tossed them into his mouth as he pushed his chair in. \u201cMake sure I got time to shower before dinner,\u201d he managed to say through the mouthful, and he was heading for the back door.</p><p>\u201cHoller if you need help,\u201d she called after him with a smile.</p><p>He raised his hand and waved over his shoulder before disappearing out the door. Mara smiled and shook her head. He wouldn\u2019t call if he needed help. He never did.</p><p>ZANE inhaled sharply and opened his eyes as he woke with a jerk. He was looking up at an exposed beam wooden ceiling, and after a moment, his brain caught up. He sighed and let his eyes flutter shut for a long moment before he yawned and sat up. He actually felt pretty decent, even if the couch wasn\u2019t the most comfortable he\u2019d ever napped on.</p><p>He stood up and stretched his arms toward the ceiling as he listened to what was going on around him. He could hear the faint sound of music somewhere, a regular series of thudding noises, and the clatter of dishes from the kitchen. He walked over to the entryway and looked in to see Mara Grady turning away from the sink with a large bowl full of apples and a paring knife.</p><p>She jumped slightly when she saw him standing there, and then she relaxed and laughed at herself. \u201cNot used to having you boys home,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cDid you have a nice nap?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Zane felt a smile pull at his lips, and he let it loose. Home. \u201cYeah, I did, actually,\u201d he said, hearing the faint surprise in his own voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, good,\u201d Mara said happily. She sat at the table and reached for the first apple. \u201cYou want something to eat? I think Ty may have missed a few of these,\u201d she offered as she pushed a plate of rolled dough toward him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Zane answered, a little bemused by her cheerful nature. Ty certainly hadn\u2019t inherited that. \u201cMind if I get a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself, honey,\u201d Mara answered as she worked on the apples, peeling and slicing them and tossing them into a bowl.</p><p>Zane moved over to the fridge and checked out the selection, choosing a pitcher of what looked like iced tea. He\u2019d seen her pull glasses out of a cabinet at breakfast, so he knew where to find those. He was pouring the tea when he happened to glance out the window over the sink and froze mid-pour, the tea splattering a bit on his shirt and the countertop.</p><p>In the small clearing behind the house, Ty was working on a pile of logs, splitting them easily with powerful, arcing swings of the axe he wielded. He\u2019d taken off the shirt he\u2019d been wearing and hung it on a nearby tree branch, leaving only his thin T-shirt to cover hard muscles Zane was intimately familiar with. The material was soaked through with sweat, clinging slightly, and the words were almost obscured by the darkened material. Zane could still read them, though, and they brought a smile to his face. He hadn\u2019t seen one of Ty\u2019s Tshirts in quite a while, and this one was right on par with all the others. There was a police car on it, and the words \u201cThe police never think it\u2019s as funny as you do.\u201d</p><p>As Zane watched, Ty stopped, set the axe down, and yanked the T-shirt over his head. He wiped his face with it and then tossed it aside.</p><p>Zane had to blink a few times as his gut cramped. Jesus. It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d never seen Ty shirtless before. Clearing his throat, he set down the pitcher and picked up the damp dishrag to wipe up the mess he\u2019d made.</p><p>\u201cIs that a bad batch?\u201d Mara asked as she turned to peer at the tea. \u201cSometimes Earl makes it and it could peel the paint off an outhouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s fine. I just, uh, missed the glass a little,\u201d Zane said weakly, turning on the cold water to wash out the rag, keeping his body facing the sink. It probably wouldn\u2019t do for Mara to see how tight his jeans were all of a sudden. It was indecent how sometimes just one look at Ty was all it took.</p><p>\u201cAll the time you boys spend at the shooting range you\u2019d think your aim would be better,\u201d Mara said with a smile evident in her voice.</p><p>Zane snorted as he got himself at least somewhat under control. He moved to put the pitcher back in the fridge. \u201cIt\u2019s vacation. I wasn\u2019t really aiming to do anything remotely resembling work.\u201d As he picked up his glass after shutting the fridge door, he couldn\u2019t help but glance back out the window.</p><p>He could hear the pop of the axe hitting every time Ty swung it. Each log split cleanly, no match for the power Ty could put behind the swings, lifting the axe up in a jerky motion and then bringing it down with frightening speed. Zane could see the thin layer of sweat on Ty\u2019s skin, glistening in the dying light as his muscles bunched and shifted. His frame wasn\u2019t bulky, but Zane knew he was solid. Solid and strong. Especially since the Bureau\u2019s gym was as close as Ty could get to action lately. Zane shook his head and made himself turn his back on the sight before he got caught staring. With a settling breath, he joined Mara at the table, sitting across from her and pulling the plate of baked dough pieces a little closer.</p><p>\u201cHe ain\u2019t cut any limbs off, has he?\u201d Mara asked wryly.</p><p>\u201cAll accounted for,\u201d Zane said as he took a bite of a dough roll. \u201cSo far, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Mara smiled without looking up from her apple. \u201cI never worried about Ty when it came to sharp things,\u201d she told Zane with a mixture of amusement and sadness. \u201cDeacon, now he\u2019s another matter. He\u2019s not even allowed to peel apples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeacon,\u201d Zane mumbled before swallowing the rest of the cookie. \u201cUnusual name.\u201d</p><p>Mara was nodding. \u201dDeacon was my mama\u2019s maiden name. It\u2019s a tradition \u2019round here, starting to die out, though,\u201d she informed Zane as she dumped a handful of apple slices into the bowl and reached for another.</p><p>Zane remembered now. Tyler wasn\u2019t really his partner\u2019s first name. Burns had introduced him as B. Tyler Grady. Ty had warned him off asking questions about it, and Zane had promptly set it aside. Zane smiled as he nabbed another cookie. \u201cTy\u2019s not fond of his first name, huh?\u201d he chanced.</p><p>Mara was shaking her head, her eyes on the apple she was peeling. The rhythmic thwack of the axe splitting wood reached them as they sat there. \u201cAlways hated it, even when he was tiny. I think that\u2019s why he makes up his own names for everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean his nicknames?\u201d Zane asked fondly.</p><p>Mara nodded again. \u201cHow many has he got for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really couldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d Zane said in the same wry tone. \u201cAlthough Lone Star seems pretty popular.\u201d He glanced to the window but couldn\u2019t see out at this angle. \u201cWhen we first met it was a different one every hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo telling how that boy\u2019s mind works,\u201d Mara muttered. \u201cHe has friends he\u2019s known for twenty years, and I still don\u2019t know their real names.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed and leaned back in the chair, extending legs to the side of the table and crossing them at the ankles. \u201cHe\u2019s still got friends back that far, huh? Pre-military,\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Mara answered in a surprised voice, as if that should have been obvious to Zane. \u201cIf he\u2019s in the area much longer they\u2019ll start showing up at the door too. His best friends, though, they came from the service.\u201d She sighed softly and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with that,\u201d Zane said slowly. \u201cMarines are pretty good guys.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mara glanced up at him, eyes wide. She nodded. \u201cThey are. For the most part. I wonder about a person who\u2019d choose to be one of his own accord,\u201d she admitted, her voice low. \u201cGrady boys have been Marines for a long time. Drafted, every one of \u2019em. When Ty was born, and then Deacon, I swore they\u2019d be the first who didn\u2019t have to fight for a living. And then Ty went and volunteered,\u201d she said with a sorrowful shake of her head. \u201cI was proud of him, mind you. But I cried for a month.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t know what to say to that. From what he did know of Ty, he could imagine his partner had been on fire to move when he graduated high school, and the Marines gave him his way out. He wondered if Ty knew what it had done to his mother.</p><p>Mara looked up at him, her cheeks flushing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Zane, I didn\u2019t mean to go into that.\u201d</p> <p>It was easier than he thought to meet her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s talked about you a few times. Good things,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Mara smiled, the wrinkles around her eyes and mouth appearing briefly. \u201cHe\u2019s a good boy. I just wish he didn\u2019t like to shoot things quite so much.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t stop the sharp laugh, marveling at how Mara seemed to be able to take everything in stride. \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll have to disagree, since he\u2019s watching my back.\u201d</p><p>Mara nodded as she dumped another handful of apple slices into her bowl. Her face was set in a frown now, her brow furrowed and her eyes thoughtful. In the silence, Zane could hear Ty chopping wood, the occasional grunt of exertion accompanying the thwack of the axe hitting.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably about done with that pile,\u201d Mara observed. \u201cIf you want a shower before dinner you best go do it now before he gets in,\u201d she advised.</p> <p>Zane scooted back and stood to take his glass to the sink. As he set it down, he looked back outside and watched for a long moment. \u201cI\u2019m going to see if he has any other plans. Otherwise I\u2019m good for tonight.\u201d He turned around and offered Mara a smile before walking to the back door.</p><p>Mara\u2019s chair creaked as she turned to look over her shoulder at him. \u201cYou\u2019re a good boy, Zane,\u201d she told him as she went back to peeling her apples.</p><p>Zane paused on the doorstep to look back at her in mild surprise. He wasn\u2019t sure what that was about, but it seemed a motherly thing to say, so he decided not to think on it and just appreciate the sentiment. He stepped outside, let the screen door snap shut behind him, took a few paces along the stone path, and stopped a healthy distance away to watch and wait for Ty to stop.</p><p>It only took a few more minutes for Ty to finish the pile. Once he\u2019d arranged the last few halves into a woodpile that wouldn\u2019t topple, he picked up his T-shirt and swiped it over his damp body. He looked up and stopped briefly, betraying his surprise at seeing Zane standing there.</p><p>Raising an eyebrow in mimicry, Zane tipped his head to the side. \u201cDidn\u2019t know I was here?\u201d he asked, amused.</p><p>\u201cThought you were asleep,\u201d Ty answered as he moved closer. He was slightly out of breath, his hair wet with sweat.</p> <p>\u201cWoke up about fifteen minutes ago. Sat with your mom and had a snack.\u201d Zane didn\u2019t even try to look away.</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes and looked him over. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked suspiciously.</p><p>Zane waggled his eyebrows and smirked, dragging his eyes up and down over Ty\u2019s sweaty and very appealing body.</p><p>Ty looked down at himself and then rolled his eyes. \u201cI know,\u201d he muttered as his cheeks colored. \u201cAll I need is the long blond hair, right?\u201d he asked wryly, poking fun at himself even though it was obvious he was embarrassed. He wiped himself down with the T-shirt again and walked over to pluck his other shirt from the branch he\u2019d hung it on.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change anything on my account,\u201d Zane murmured, sliding his hands into his back pockets. \u201cDifferent than a gym workout, you know?\u201d</p><p>Ty moved toward him, his shirts hanging from his hand. \u201cYou a little turned on, Garrett?\u201d he asked with a smirk, his tone surprised.</p><p>\u201cMore than a little, Grady,\u201d Zane said under his breath. He sighed as Ty approached, eyeing him warily.</p><p>Ty hummed wordlessly. \u201cToo bad there\u2019s no wood to chop back home then,\u201d he joked.</p> <p>Zane shrugged slightly. His smile was just as obvious as before. \u201cI\u2019m sure I could find you some wood to work on,\u201d he said evenly, eyes twinkling.</p><p>Ty\u2019s lips twitched as he tried not to smile. \u201cThat\u2019s after-dinner talk, there,\u201d he drawled before he started laughing. \u201cWe\u2019ve really got to work on your word play,\u201d he said as he moved closer and, to Zane\u2019s surprise, put his arm around Zane\u2019s shoulders as he turned him toward the house. He smelled of a mixture of sweat, wood, shampoo, Old Spice, and... Ty.</p><p>Zane chuckled and they bumped against each other randomly as Ty maneuvered them up the walk to the door. \u201cThere\u2019s always something you want me to work on,\u201d he complained. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be on vacation, for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Ty merely squeezed Zane\u2019s shoulders before releasing him, and Zane grinned at him as he opened the screen door and motioned him inside.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>IT HAD been an incredible dinner\u2014a huge, tender pork roast with all the trimmings, hot yeast rolls, and apple cobbler for dessert. Zane had finally sat back from the table, stuffed to the gills. It had been a nice, relaxing day. He\u2019d napped, been shown around the place, been told stories of the havoc Ty and Deuce had wreaked upon the community in their youth, and had taken a short trip into the town of Bluefield to load up on supplies for the hike.</p><p>Ty had promised him a better tour of his hometown at a later date, and Zane was actually looking forward to it. He hadn\u2019t seen much more of Ty\u2019s parents. Mara had spent the day cooking and making various and sundry edible things for them to take with them on the trail, and Earl had headed back to the mines.</p><p>Ty had carefully avoided anything even remotely concerning the mines or accompanying his father. Zane didn\u2019t blame him. They\u2019d sat on the front porch and relaxed for the remainder of the day, not even really speaking much as each of them tried to unwind and accept their forced vacation for what it was.</p><p>Once dinner was over and they were sitting around the table enjoying the last cup of coffee for the night, Mara stood and tapped Ty on the top of the head. \u201cCome help me make up the couch,\u201d she requested.</p><p>Ty sat back and frowned at her. \u201cI have to sleep on the couch?\u201d he asked her incredulously. \u201cI\u2019ve slept on rocks more comfortable than that thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you go out back and find yourself a rock so you\u2019ll feel better about it,\u201d Mara suggested.</p><p>\u201cCouch?\u201d Zane asked in a low voice as he leaned closer to Earl, an eyebrow rising.</p><p>Earl was smiling widely. He nodded when Zane looked to him. \u201cMy wife has made up Ty\u2019s old bedroom for you,\u201d he told him in a low voice as Ty and Mara argued over the merits of the couch cushions versus the rocks out back.</p><p>\u201cOh Christ.\u201d Zane laughed, falling back in his chair. \u201cHe won\u2019t let me forget this. Losing his bed to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Earl said with a sigh, \u201cit\u2019s either that or fight his mama over it.\u201d He sat and watched Ty and Mara for a moment, sipping at his coffee contentedly. \u201cAin\u2019t none of us ever won that fight,\u201d he told Zane flatly.</p><p>\u201cMe and Zane\u2019ll just bunk together,\u201d Ty was arguing.</p><p>Mara laughed at him. \u201cYou two boys won\u2019t fit in a double bed any more than I\u2019ll still fit in my wedding dress,\u201d she scoffed.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Zane would end up on the floor when you\u2019re done with him,\u201d Mara continued, \u201cand I will not have a guest in this house sleeping on the rug, so come help me make up the couch.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane, his lips twitching at the irony of what his mother said. They would fit in a double bed together just fine, but only because they had a lot of practice with occupying the same space while horizontal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a pallet on the floor, Ma,\u201d Ty assured Mara. She looked at him dubiously, but he just smiled at her innocently. \u201cFor myself,\u201d he added.</p><p>Mara rolled her eyes, smiling as she turned away. \u201cFine,\u201d she agreed. \u201cAs long as he don\u2019t end up on the floor,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cNot like tomorrow night, when we\u2019ll all be on the floor,\u201d Deuce mumbled.</p><p>\u201cOutdoors in the cold,\u201d Earl added from behind his mug.</p><p>\u201cWith the rocks,\u201d Ty concluded as he glanced sideways at his mother and smirked.</p><p>\u201cBuncha dumbasses,\u201d Chester muttered as he stood and shuffled out of the room.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my kitchen, all of you,\u201d Mara ordered with an irritated wave of her hand.</p><p>Ty and Deuce practically scattered, leaving Zane to fend for himself. Earl remained where he sat, finishing his coffee and laughing softly. Shaking his head at their retreat, Zane said his goodnights and walked up the stairs. Earlier in the day, he and Ty had brought their bags upstairs to the spare room\u2014Ty\u2019s former bedroom\u2014and now he pushed the door shut with a soft click as he sat down to pull off his boots.</p><p>Looking around the room, he realized that it wasn\u2019t so much a spare room as it was still Ty\u2019s bedroom. The walls were still adorned with the trappings of high school life: pictures, awards, trophies, and knickknacks lined the shelves and hung from the walls.</p><p>It was enlightening to see a younger Ty, before the FBI, before the military. Zane stood up and started around the room, smiling at some of the photos. Ty\u2019s wide grin was clear, so much more so than now. He\u2019d been happy and unbothered by life\u2019s problems.</p><p>As Zane surveyed the items displayed on the shelves, he gained little pieces of insight into what had been important to Ty then. There was an old football with faded writing on it, as well as several ribbons that signified first and third place finishes, but they didn\u2019t tell what they were for. There was a fiddle case on a shelf near the window and an old guitar beside it, and Zane smiled as he remembered how appalled Ty had been when he\u2019d admitted he knew how to play.</p><p>Almost every photo on the wall had Ty\u2019s brother in it as well. They\u2019d obviously always been close, even more so then than now. One of the most prominent pictures was of the two of them standing together in front of the old garage that still stood beside the house. They were both covered in grease, wearing nasty coveralls, holding wrenches as they wrapped their arms over each other\u2019s shoulders and grinned at the camera. Behind them was an old motorcycle, halfway through being restored.</p><p>As he stared at it, he wondered again why Ty hated the Valkyrie so much.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure how long he\u2019d been standing there before he heard the click of the door and felt that he was no longer alone.</p><p>\u201cSnoop,\u201d Ty accused softly as he moved into the room quietly.</p><p>Zane smiled. \u201cKind of hard to miss photos when the walls are papered with them.\u201d</p><p>Ty lowered his head and smiled as he slid his hands into the pockets of his jeans. \u201cI left a week after I graduated high school,\u201d he said. \u201cMa never touched this room. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s even vacuumed it.\u201d Zane turned to face his partner. Ty was staring at him, his head slightly cocked. \u201cShe was afraid I\u2019d never come back,\u201d he said with a hint of melancholy. \u201cWanted it to stay like I left it.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded slowly. \u201cMine feels the same way,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThey love you, though.\u201d</p><p>Ty raised an eyebrow and nodded. \u201cYou saying yours don\u2019t?\u201d he asked as he moved closer.</p><p>Zane\u2019s shoulders tightened. \u201cNo. Doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t wonder about my mom sometimes.\u201d He watched Ty approach and slid his hands into his jeans pockets to mirror his stance.</p><p>Ty stopped just inches away from him, studying him with an unreadable expression. \u201cI\u2019ll get Ma to bake you a pie, make you feel better,\u201d he offered finally, his tone of voice and his expression entirely serious. The only way to know that he was teasing was the slight glint in his hazel eyes.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips twitched at the ultra-dry humor. \u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever had a pie baked for me before. My mom\u2019s more the cookie type.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted in disdain and turned away, heading for the double bed. He flopped down on the end of it and bent to begin unlacing his boots. \u201cShe always has one waiting for us when we get back from a hike. Apple, usually. Good stuff, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Zane agreed. He was glad he had his hands in his pockets; his fingers were itching to touch Ty, but he had no idea what Ty would allow, especially here in his parents\u2019 home. He toed out of his running shoes and unbuckled his belt, his gaze not wavering.</p><p>Ty seemed to sense his eyes on him, and he looked up at him questioningly as he pulled off one boot. Zane shook his head very slightly and glanced to the door Ty had left half-open. Ty followed his eyes and then smiled as he looked back at Zane.</p><p>\u201cGetting a little antsy?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zane said immediately.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the bedroom you grew up in,\u201d Zane pointed out. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to expect with you here.\u201d</p><p>Ty began to laugh softly, and he bit his lip to keep from laughing harder as he pulled his other boot off and set it carefully beside the first at the foot of the bed. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing anything wrong, Garrett,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWe\u2019re just sleeping here,\u201d he said with a wry twist of his lips as he stood back up.</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes and decided some reciprocal teasing was in order. \u201cFine. Then you can close your eyes and \u2018sleep\u2019 while I undress,\u201d he proposed innocently, pulling his hands out of his pockets and pulling his shirt over his head, letting it fall on the foot of the bed. He knew Ty enjoyed this part of their time together; he did too. The chemistry between them seemed to click just a little better when they got up close and personal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCocktease,\u201d Ty accused in a low voice, and he moved closer, took Zane\u2019s face in his hands, and kissed him.</p><p>Smiling against his lips, Zane hummed quietly and slid his arms around Ty, settling his hands at the small of his back. Ty continued the kiss for one more breath before pulling away. He turned and went to sit down on the end of the bed again to pull off his socks and continue getting ready for bed.</p><p>Sighing, Zane got out of his jeans and moved to sit near him on the side of the bed with the lamp. He pulled his feet up and leaned back against the headboard, propping his elbows on his knees and lacing his fingers together, his dark eyes riveted on Ty. He watched the muscles of his back move beneath the thin white shirt he wore, and he mentally cursed. They\u2019d never been in a situation where they wanted to fuck and couldn\u2019t. The only restrictions they\u2019d ever encountered had been each other. This was a new and disconcerting feeling. Zane didn\u2019t like having obstacles between himself and what he wanted.</p> <p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Ty warned without looking back at him, obviously knowing what he was pondering.</p><p>Zane smiled slightly. That just meant Ty was thinking the same thing. He could still hear the other members of the household moving about, preparing for bed. Until the house settled, they would need to at least pretend they wouldn\u2019t jump each other at the first chance.</p><p>The lights on the landing were still on, and Ty stood to go turn them off and shut the bedroom door. He flicked off the light beside the door, throwing the room into temporary inky darkness. When Zane\u2019s eyes began to adjust, he could see Ty still standing by the closed door. Zane smiled again. He hoped Ty remembered to wake up to do whatever he had planned, because Ty definitely had something in mind. Sex would be great, of course\u2014it always was\u2014but Zane would be happy to settle for simply holding him. Something about hearing Ty breathe, so calm and close, was reassuring in ways Zane didn\u2019t examine too closely.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Ty,\u201d Zane murmured as he scooted under the sheet.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty grumbled as he moved through the darkness toward the blankets on the floor.</p> <p>IT WAS nearly pitch black outside when Ty finally got restless enough to sit up. He sat cross-legged on the cold floor, staring out the bedroom window for a long, dull moment before he pushed the blanket aside and stood. The cool air hit him and made him shiver all over as he looked down at Zane, asleep in the bed.</p><p>Ty stood looking over him in the faint light from the moon through the window. He looked older, worn thin and worried even in sleep. Tense. It was something Ty had tried for weeks to fix, trying to get Zane to just let go of the past and enjoy the present. But the more Zane had resisted, the less Ty had cared about trying to help him. He didn\u2019t like where that left them, but he didn\u2019t know how to change it. The only things they really seemed to be good at were getting into trouble or getting into each other.</p><p>Ty reached over and brushed his fingers against Zane\u2019s cheek. His fingers had barely grazed skin when Zane reacted. He shot up and shoved hard with both hands, sending Ty back to the floor. Just as quickly, his hand was digging under the pillow, scrabbling for his gun. Ty hit the floor with a thump and immediately rolled to his side, covering his head and hoping Zane\u2019s gun either wasn\u2019t loaded or wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cGoddamnit,\u201d Zane hissed when he didn\u2019t find it, and he swiped at the bedside lamp, almost knocking it over and having to grab for it before fumbling to switch it on.</p><p>Ty was already shaking with silent laughter as he rolled onto his back. He looked up at the side of the bed in a mixture of relief and amusement.</p><p>Zane groaned and flopped back onto the bed, throwing his arm over his eyes. \u201cI knew it was a good idea to leave my gun in my bag,\u201d he muttered half into the pillow.</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d Ty assured him in a whisper as he got to his knees and rested his elbows on the side of the bed. Rolling to his side, Zane squinted at him obstinately. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want me to wake you?\u201d Ty asked him with a knowing smile.</p><p>Zane relaxed onto his back, his eyes focusing as he looked at Ty. Ty smiled up at him, silent as he listened to make sure no one was coming to check on the noise. When he was convinced that everyone was still asleep, he climbed up onto the bed and lowered himself carefully to rest on his belly beside Zane. Zane threw the covers over him.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Ty whispered as he settled into the warmth. \u201cI used to wake up swinging when I came home on leave,\u201d he told Zane quietly after a moment. \u201cAlmost decked my mama once. Dad made me sleep in the garage the next night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you don\u2019t visit your family a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a summer spent without being relegated to the garage was a summer wasted,\u201d Ty told him fondly. \u201cI don\u2019t visit as much as I should,\u201d he answered guiltily. \u201cSince the Tri-State case I haven\u2019t at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it weird for you? Me being here with you?\u201d Zane asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty answered with a small laugh. \u201cI rarely bring anyone home with me,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIf we had an extended leave and one of the boys couldn\u2019t go home, I\u2019d bring him with me. Maggie was the last one I brought home, though, and that\u2019s been about five years,\u201d he told Zane with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cMaggie?\u201d Zane\u2019s voice was careful.</p> <p>\u201cStray dog,\u201d Ty answered with a look at Zane and a small smile. He knew he probably shouldn\u2019t, but he still enjoyed those little hints that Zane might want him enough to be jealous. Zane merely nodded and smiled. \u201cTry going downstairs to Grandpa\u2019s bedroom, you\u2019ll trip over her. Right before you meet the shovel,\u201d Ty advised as he tried not to laugh at the thought of that damn shovel. Chester Grady woke at the drop of a feather and would whack you in the face with that thing first and then wait until morning when it was light to see who you were and if you needed an ambulance. They did not want to meet that shovel tonight.</p><p>Ty licked his lips and looked at Zane seriously again. \u201cBut as far as anyone... someone who wasn\u2019t a stray, you\u2019re about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m honored, then. I like your family. They\u2019re absolutely nuts, but I like them,\u201d Zane added.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Ty said with a shrug of one shoulder, \u201cwith them, pretty much anything goes. If you stay away from religion, politics, and the designated hitter, you\u2019re gonna get along fine.\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled and shifted uncomfortably, pulling the pillow slightly under his chest and tucking his hands under it. \u201cHow\u2019s the floor treating you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ty grinned and stretched toward the lamp to turn off the light. He waited a couple minutes in silence until he could see again in the darkness that followed and scooted closer to Zane. \u201cI like it much better here,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Zane grunted in agreement, grasped Ty\u2019s chin, and pulled him sideways into a soft kiss. Ty responded eagerly, shifting closer and sliding his hand over Zane\u2019s waist to tug at him. He rolled until he had Zane under him, but his actions were gentler than they usually were\u2014he was trying to keep the noise down. He knew his old bed was liable to creak and groan even if you weren\u2019t being overly active.</p><p>Zane obviously sensed that he was trying to be quiet. He didn\u2019t do anything that might be heard, keeping his hands under the pillow and leaving his mouth upturned to receive more kisses. Ty let his hands slide up Zane\u2019s arms to his wrists; he pulled them free of the pillow and held him against the mattress, still kissing him slowly. Zane\u2019s hands splayed as he stretched out his fingers, but he didn\u2019t try to pull free. He chased Ty\u2019s tongue with his own, drawing the kiss out. It was a disconcertingly tender moment, a rare thing for them.</p><p>It was long moments before Ty pushed himself up and looked down at Zane hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you having second thoughts now that I\u2019m awake?\u201d Zane prodded, dragging his wrists free of Ty\u2019s fists so he could slide his hands down Ty\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cIs it worth getting banged over the head with a shovel if we make too much noise?\u201d Ty asked as he dug his foot between Zane\u2019s legs and pushed them apart, settling between his thighs.</p><p>Zane moved his legs without resisting and bit back a snicker. \u201cYou\u2019ve been banged both by that shovel and by me. Is it worth it?\u201d he parroted as he squeezed Ty\u2019s ass and slid one hand down the back of his thigh.</p><p>Ty grinned crookedly and began shaking his head. \u201cNot really,\u201d he answered dryly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll risk it,\u201d Zane said, grabbing the back of Ty\u2019s neck and pulling him down for a harder kiss.</p><p>The bed creaked in warning with the rapid movement. Ty growled in frustration and pushed himself up, looking around the dim room briefly before he threw the blankets off them and tossed the pillows down to the floor. He grabbed Zane tightly and rolled them right off the bed, causing another muffled thud when they hit the floor. Thankfully, it was a low bed.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Ty decided as he pulled the blankets off the bed to fall back on top of them.</p><p>Zane groaned and gasped as he tried not to laugh. \u201cOw... what about being quiet?\u201d he asked in a harsh whisper as Ty settled on top of him again.</p><p>\u201cGive it a second,\u201d Ty whispered in return, cocking his head to listen.</p><p>Zane closed his eyes, and Ty focused on the sounds around them as he kissed lightly at Zane\u2019s neck and chest. He could hear Zane\u2019s soft breathing above the noises of the house, the creaking as it settled in the cold, the click and whir of the appliances downstairs, the hum of the large freezer on the porch just off the kitchen, the soft scattering of leaves scratching against the window.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes were still closed when Ty\u2019s lips brushed his again. He slid a hand under Zane\u2019s briefs and tugged at the elastic.</p><p>\u201cMmm. What do you want?\u201d Zane murmured, shifting on the cool wood floor to give Ty\u2019s hand more access.</p><p>Ty shook his head and grinned. \u201cJust you,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Zane smirked and held his arms out to his sides. \u201cGo on then,\u201d he invited in a rough purr. \u201cSnag the duffel.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s bag was only an arm\u2019s length away at the foot of the bed. Ty reached for it, pushing himself down into Zane as he did so, getting a soft groan that made him smile. He got the bag between his fingertips and pulled it closer, pausing to steal a kiss.</p><p>Somewhere in the house, a door snicked shut, and Ty paused long enough to listen and hear the water running before he continued. Once the bag was next to them, Zane twisted around and dug through it, pulling out his shaving kit before pushing the duffel away again. He unzipped the bag and pulled out a familiar tube and a plastic packet. Ty waited impatiently for perhaps ten seconds before he pushed himself off Zane and began peeling off the rest of his own clothing.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t hit the stage in their relationship when foreplay was something important. Ty, especially, knew he was unlikely to even think about such nuances. Zane didn\u2019t need to be seduced. Ty didn\u2019t suppose that Zane wanted to be seduced, either. There was never any question that Ty wanted him in bed, and that seemed to be enough to keep Zane happy.</p><p>Ty fussed with his boxers and fell back to lay down to take them off, but then he struggled to get his legs untangled from the blankets in order to continue. It was all very difficult in the dark when he was in a hurry.</p><p>Zane groaned, rolling toward Ty in an attempt to get closer. He reached to slide his hands under Ty\u2019s T-shirt, gripping warm flesh, and then he tugged Ty\u2019s shirt off, making sure to touch lots of skin as he went. Ty slowly laid his back to the cold hardwood floor again, pulling at Zane to follow.</p><p>After kicking his briefs off, Zane leaned over to slide his tongue up the crease of Ty\u2019s thigh. Ty tensed below him, just like he always did despite his continued efforts not to. Zane had either stopped caring or started pretending not to notice. Ty was grateful, either way. He lifted his shoulders off the hardwood to arch his back as he handed the lubricant and condom back to Zane wordlessly. Then he rolled in Zane\u2019s arms, turning over onto his stomach.</p><p>Zane leaned over him, grabbing hold of Ty\u2019s wrist and squeezing it. \u201cYou sure?\u201d he whispered into Ty\u2019s ear.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t bottom easily or passively even under the best of circumstances, and they both knew it. \u201cI\u2019ll be quieter than you are,\u201d he answered anyway. Zane didn\u2019t usually restrain himself when Ty was fucking him. It was a very vocal, very arousing experience, one that Ty rarely turned down the opportunity to enjoy. But.... \u201cI\u2019m not running into that shovel with my pants down.\u201d</p><p>Zane popped open the tube and soon slid his slick fingers between Ty\u2019s legs as he leaned over to nuzzle against his ear. Ty\u2019s fingers gripped the blanket, clenching slowly. He shifted again, pushing up onto his hands and knees, spreading his legs wider as Zane slid a finger into him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have all night, Garrett,\u201d Ty hissed at him impatiently.</p><p>Zane shushed him and twisted his fingers harder and deeper before leaning back to grab the condom. Ty heard the crinkling plastic flutter to the floor and Zane\u2019s hand grasped one of Ty\u2019s hips, pulling him back as he leaned over him, one hand braced next to Ty\u2019s on the hardwood floor.</p><p>Zane was good at this, and Ty always reacted the same way: heartbeat racing, breaths shallow and fast, excitement and nerves churning in his gut. It was all part of Zane\u2019s charm.</p><p>Ty squirmed under him, pushing his hips back and lowering his shoulders, resting his head on the floor as he did so. Letting out a slow breath, Zane pumped his hips slowly, working himself inside. Ty groaned and bit his hand to keep from making any more noise as Zane forced his cock past the tense muscles and pain seared through him. It ebbed quickly, though, and he moved under Zane\u2019s weight to help, his entire body flooding with heat as Zane rocked deeper into him. It always felt so damned good; Ty was never sure why he didn\u2019t do this more often. But that just led to more questions he didn\u2019t want to find answers to, and he\u2019d rather focus on what Zane was doing to him right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane drew a deep, quiet breath as he gripped Ty\u2019s hips and pulled back, starting with slow thrusts. Ty closed his eyes and bit his hand harder, telling himself not to moan as Zane moved inside him. But it was difficult to keep quiet when Zane was sliding into him with slow, deep thrusts. It wouldn\u2019t stay slow and sensual like this for long; it never did with them, no matter who took the lead or how determined they both were to make it last.</p><p>Zane\u2019s hand slid up his back until he was gripping Ty\u2019s shoulder, his fingers digging into Ty\u2019s skin. The blanket beneath Ty\u2019s hands began to slide, and Ty went with it, the weight of Zane\u2019s body on top of him stretching him and the blanket out on the floor. When Ty was flat on the floor, Zane shifted to plant his knees outside of Ty\u2019s. He pushed down on the backs of Ty\u2019s shoulders as he worked up to a steady, heated rhythm that would please them both sooner rather than later.</p><p>Ty found himself pinned flat to the floor, with Zane using his knees and shoulders for leverage as he fucked him. He gasped wordlessly against the blanket under him, liking the overpowering weight of Zane\u2019s body on him. Zane snapped his hips down, hard, and Ty had to bite his lip to keep from crying out. He bent his knees and lifted his feet, pushing his heels against Zane\u2019s ass to urge him on. Zane grunted quietly before lowering himself to hold Ty closer and speed his thrusts.</p> <p>The sound of their bodies slapping together was loud in the otherwise silent room, and Zane slowed his thrusts again, grunting in Ty\u2019s ear. \u201cNot much longer,\u201d he warned breathlessly.</p><p>Ty responded to his warning by tensing around the hard cock inside him, and he reached back to drag his short fingernails across the naked skin of Zane\u2019s hip. Zane grunted and trembled with restraint as he continued. Ty panted heavily against the blankets under him as his body tightened. He wouldn\u2019t last much longer either. He never did with Zane\u2019s cock inside him.</p><p>Zane bit the back of his shoulder, hard, and Ty grit his teeth against the shout of pleasure it almost produced. Zane pushed off him again, his hands on Ty\u2019s shoulders as he pounded his cock past the tight ring of muscle, heedless of the sound their bodies made as they met or of the fact that Ty\u2019s groans were steadily gaining in volume. It felt like his cock drove deeper and deeper, his grunts of exertion and pleasure in Ty\u2019s ears, until Ty could do nothing but whimper helplessly as his body convulsed. His fingers dug into Zane\u2019s hip, and he writhed beneath his lover as he spilled himself against the blanket.</p><p>After a few more hard thrusts, Zane froze in place and his grip tightened, his whole body locked in the fight between climax and silence, shuddering. He rocked into Ty a few more times before he finally relaxed and rested his head against Ty\u2019s back, breathing hard and trembling.</p><p>\u201cGood job,\u201d Ty finally offered in a hoarse voice. Zane groaned softly before pulling free with a plaintive gasp. He lowered himself carefully to the floor beside Ty. Ty rolled onto his back, letting his body stretch out, investigating the aches. No matter how ready he was for it, Zane\u2019s cock inside him always left aches. That was part of the fun. \u201cI would have bet money we couldn\u2019t be quiet,\u201d he whispered as he stared at the ceiling.</p> <p>Zane smiled at him and shook his head. \u201cAlways glad to prove you wrong,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ty turned his head to look at him and laughed suddenly. \u201cYou wound up on the floor after all,\u201d he observed with a snicker.</p><p>\u201cFunny guy,\u201d Zane grunted before climbing to his feet and offering Ty a hand.</p><p>Ty stared at him from where he lay flat on his back. Sometimes he wondered if Zane just tolerated him because he was a good lay, or if he truly enjoyed being around him as much as Ty did Zane. He told himself that was another question for a later time. Finally, he reached up and took Zane\u2019s hand, pulling himself to his feet. \u201cThanks,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Lacing their hands together, Zane leaned to kiss him, just for a moment. He squeezed Ty\u2019s hands and nodded before loosening his grip. Ty sniffed daintily at the tender gesture as he turned away and bent to gather the clothing he\u2019d shed. Well, maybe Zane did enjoy it a little.</p><p>As Zane grabbed his shirt and used it for a quick clean before pulling his briefs on, Ty pulled his pants on haphazardly and headed for the bathroom to do a slightly better job of cleaning himself. When he returned, Zane was gathering up the extra covers and tossing them on the bed. Ty watched him with a smirk as he slid his T-shirt over his head. \u201cMight want to flush that instead of tossing it in the trash,\u201d he said with a nod at Zane and the condom he had yet to discard. \u201cMa\u2019ll be wondering what we were doing when she empties the trashcans,\u201d he joked quietly.</p> <p>\u201cYou think?\u201d Zane muttered. He left the room quietly as Ty straightened out the sheets and blankets left askew from their fun.</p><p>\u201cFucker,\u201d Ty grumbled affectionately as he made up the bed. He knew he might never explain to himself the emotions Zane caused in him. He didn\u2019t mind the mystery. It was another part of what made it fun. What he did mind was the uneasy feeling that Zane merely tolerated him rather than enjoyed him. Again, he told himself to worry about that later\u2014much later\u2014and he climbed into bed.</p><p>When Zane returned, he slipped under the covers beside Ty and immediately wrapped around him, pulling Ty closer just as he would the pillows he liked to hold. With a sigh, Ty pondered over the question of whether his doubts were unfounded or if Zane was just a cuddler. They hadn\u2019t had a lot of time to feel each other out. As partners, it seemed like they could read each other\u2019s minds. But as lovers\u2014or even friends\u2014they barely knew each other at all.</p><p>He sighed and scooted closer, twisting his body so he could brush an awkward kiss against Zane\u2019s cheek. \u201cSleep well, Zane,\u201d he offered quietly as he settled into the embrace. He closed his eyes and sighed again. Zane slept much better with Ty alongside him than he did when he was alone, and they both knew it.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Zane murmured, his breath warm against the back of Ty\u2019s ear.</p><p>BY THE time Zane got down to the kitchen the next morning, breakfast was on the table, and Ty and Deuce were sitting together, drinking orange juice while their mother bustled around them and scolded them for stealing some of her apples.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Ty greeted as he gestured to an empty chair.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Zane dear, how did you sleep?\u201d Mara asked as she came up to him and pressed a glass of orange juice into his hands.</p> <p>\u201cAh, okay,\u201d Zane hedged, taking the glass out of self-defense. \u201cI don\u2019t do too well sleeping in strange places lately, but....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Ty\u2019s bed is about as strange a place as you can get,\u201d Deuce offered under his breath. He followed it with a muffled grunt as Ty kicked him under the table.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind them, we dropped \u2019em both on their heads when they was little,\u201d Mara assured Zane as she moved back to her stove, where two different skillets sizzled. She\u2019d been cooking for some time already; the kitchen was warm from the heated oven, and it was the smell of crisp bacon and fresh biscuits that had beckoned Zane downstairs.</p><p>Zane turned a look on the two brothers, his eyes narrowing slightly. Under the brown Western-style flannel shirt Ty wore, Zane was pleased to see that he was also wearing another one of his signature Tshirts. It was oddly reassuring to see it. It was brown with white writing on the front, two crossed paddles advertising \u201cSchitt Creek Paddle Co.\u201d Zane didn\u2019t bother to hide his amused snort, but the others paid him no mind.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your daddy?\u201d Mara asked them as she sat at the head of the table.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t my morning to babysit him,\u201d Ty answered as he poured himself more juice.</p><p>\u201cWell, you and your smart mouth go find him so we can eat,\u201d Mara responded without blinking an eye. Ty stood immediately, snatching a sausage link as he went. \u201cAnd track down your granddaddy too!\u201d his mother called after him.</p><p>Zane watched over the edge of his juice glass as Ty headed out of the kitchen, taking particular notice of the worn jeans that were molded to Ty\u2019s ass as he moved around the corner.</p><p>\u201cZane, tell me,\u201d Mara said, drawing his attention, \u201chow do you enjoy working for the FBI?\u201d</p><p>Surprised by the question out of left field, Zane hesitated as he pushed the visual of Ty away for later. \u201cIt\u2019s like any job, I guess. I like it some days, others not so much. Ty makes it interesting sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son does do that to people,\u201d she agreed with a sigh as she sipped at her coffee. \u201cBoth of them do,\u201d she added wryly as she glanced at Deuce, who looked at Mara with an obviously feigned hurt expression.</p><p>Zane chuckled and took a drink of his juice. \u201cHe makes up for it, though. He\u2019s a good partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he?\u201d Mara asked with true concern. Her brow furrowed, and she leaned forward, meeting his eyes questioningly.</p><p>Zane sighed and glanced at the door, weighing his options. Honesty and... honesty. \u201cAll right, he\u2019s a great partner. But don\u2019t tell him I said that.\u201d</p><p>The relief that washed over the poor woman was tangible. \u201cTy\u2019s ego was never one of the things I fretted over being broken,\u201d she assured Zane. \u201cBut I was so afraid after Jimmy was killed he would never be able to deal with a partner again,\u201d she explained as she looked down at her coffee and stirred it slowly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was easy for him,\u201d Zane said slowly. Despite how they ragged on each other, he didn\u2019t want to say anything that might be construed as badmouthing Ty in front of his family. Zane could imagine how angry he would be himself if the situation were reversed. He also knew that the Jimmy Mara referred to was Special Agent James Hathaway, who\u2019d been partnered with Ty for more than two years before he was killed in the line of duty. It wasn\u2019t a joking matter. \u201cI won\u2019t say we get along all the time, but we make it work,\u201d Zane added.</p><p>\u201cYou handle him the right way,\u201d Deuce interjected.</p><p>Mara nodded in agreement. \u201cYou have to give Ty as good as he gives you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and it\u2019s not easy. He can be hard to handle sometimes,\u201d Zane said vaguely rather than trying to make light of it.</p><p>\u201cTry raising two of \u2019em,\u201d Mara said wryly with another pointed look at Deuce.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can hear you, right?\u201d Deuce said in annoyance.</p><p>Zane smiled just like Mara did. \u201cTy gets that look on his face, too, when he\u2019s ticked off. Which is fairly often, so I\u2019m familiar with the expression,\u201d he added earnestly.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Deuce offered grumpily as he reached for a sausage link, only to get his hand slapped by Mara\u2019s spatula for the effort. He opened his mouth to protest, but a call from the front of the house interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ma!\u201d Ty yelled as the screen door slammed. Zane could hear his booted footsteps coming closer, and when Ty appeared in the doorway, he was frowning slightly. \u201cGrandpa\u2019s eyesight\u2019s getting worse, huh?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d Mara asked in concern.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause he\u2019s out in the yard, killing your garden hose with his shovel,\u201d Ty answered with a jerk of his thumb at the window.</p><p>Mara balled up her fists and made a strangled sound of frustration as she pushed her chair back noisily and stood. \u201cThat senile old goat!\u201d she muttered as she hurried out the back door. Zane made it until she was out of the room, but then he had to laugh out loud, covering his mouth with his hand.</p><p>Neither Deuce nor Ty were laughing, though, both of them treating it as if it were an everyday thing. \u201cHow\u2019s his aim?\u201d Deuce asked Ty dubiously.</p><p>\u201cStill pretty good,\u201d Ty answered in a surprised voice as he went to the window to watch, leaning over the sink. \u201cHe still sharpens the shovel tip, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know,\u201d Deuce answered as he poured himself a cup of coffee, unconcerned.</p><p>Zane\u2019s brows were nearly up into his hairline. Sharpens the shovel tip? Jesus. No wonder Ty had a penchant for weapons, growing up in this environment.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Ty said as he waved his hand around at them, still looking out the window. \u201cY\u2019all gotta see this. She\u2019s beating him with the hose,\u201d he told them as he began to snicker. \u201cGod, I love coming home,\u201d he mused as he sipped at his own juice. He made room when Deuce moved to stand next to him and peer outside.</p><p>Still laughing softly, Zane watched Ty closely, fascinated by the relaxation in his frame and the easy smile that curved his lips. What little tension that had been invested in him last night was gone. He was at ease with both himself and his surroundings, something Zane rarely observed in his partner. He was always alert and sort of twitchy when they were working or even when they were in Zane\u2019s hotel room, as if he always had a sense of impending doom and wanted to be ready when it came.</p><p>Seeing this new side to him made Zane\u2019s heart beat faster. He was just glad the two brothers were too busy watching Mara try to wrestle the shovel away from their grandfather to notice his intent focus.</p><p>\u201cYou boys just gonna stand there?\u201d Earl Grady asked them in a stern voice from the doorway behind Zane.</p><p>Both Ty and Deuce jumped slightly\u2014Zane did as well, actually, splashing a little juice onto his plate. He\u2019d been so focused on Ty that he hadn\u2019t even heard Earl approach.</p><p>\u201cGo help her,\u201d Earl ordered.</p><p>The brothers scrambled to set down their glasses without spilling the contents and get out the back door to do as they\u2019d been told as quickly as possible.</p><p>Their father waited until the door had fallen shut behind them before he sat down at the kitchen table with Zane and smiled. \u201cMorning, son,\u201d he greeted nonchalantly as he poured himself a mug of coffee. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane felt another flash of mild surprise. These people treated him like one of their own; it was the strangest thing. \u201cMorning, sir,\u201d he answered, reaching for one of the coffee mugs and the sugar bowl after sopping up the juice on his plate with his napkin.</p><p>\u201cIs it the garden hose?\u201d Earl asked before taking a sip of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Zane chanced.</p> <p>Earl chuckled and nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s the fifth one,\u201d he told Zane in mild amusement. \u201cHe got in a fight with the rake summer before last that damn near killed all of us before it was over. You try taking that shovel from him, you risk getting it shoved up your nose.\u201d</p><p>His point was emphasized by a shout from one of the combatants outside. Zane had to laugh again, just at the ridiculousness of it all. \u201cYou all are something else,\u201d he stated, still chuckling. Each of them seemed to deal with life\u2019s little absurdities in stride, something Zane had never really figured out how to do. At least not without some form of chemical help. Zane envied them.</p><p>He also wondered if this was the root of why everyone in the Bureau thought Ty was batshit crazy.</p><p>\u201cSomething else,\u201d Earl echoed. \u201cThe boys call it the galloping crazies,\u201d he informed Zane seriously.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s about right.\u201d He shook his head and scooped a teaspoon of sugar into his coffee. \u201cMy family is seriously normal. So seeing this\u201d\u2014he waved his hand around\u2014\u201cit\u2019s an eye-opener.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNormal,\u201d Earl repeated, looking at Zane as if expecting him to expand on the notion.</p><p>Zane shrugged with one shoulder. \u201cNo arguing, no rocking the boat, mind your own business, show up for Sunday lunch or else. Nothing really extraordinary, but not much bad, either. They\u2019re just... normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot close, huh?\u201d Earl commented.</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d Zane answered with a rueful curl of his lips. He was the odd man out and had been for a long time. He didn\u2019t spend any time thinking on his family if he could avoid it. There was too much to be angry or upset about.</p><p>Earl didn\u2019t respond to that other than to nod in understanding, apparently content with silence just like his son often was. Zane went back to his coffee, letting it go. Earl sat nursing his coffee for another moment before glancing at the window when there was another short shout. \u201cI reckon I could go help them,\u201d he mused.</p><p>He was saved from having to do so by Ty stomping back into the kitchen with a length of mangled green hose in his hand. \u201cHose is a goner,\u201d he told them grimly as he let the piece of hose fall into the trashcan. He lowered his head as he washed his hands and moved to sit down beside Zane, crossing his arms over his chest and covering his mouth with one hand as he tried desperately not to laugh. The others came inside as he pressed his hand over his mouth and slouched further in his chair, and Ty studiously avoided meeting his mother\u2019s eyes as she glared at him.</p> <p>Chester grinned at them all and sat beside Deuce, propping his shovel against the leg of the table carefully. \u201cThat was a big\u2019n,\u201d he told them. \u201cCold for a big\u2019n like that,\u201d he advised, which caused Ty and Deuce to break into uncontrollable snickers as they tried to hide their laughter from their mother.</p><p>Zane just grinned. \u201cI hear you\u2019ve got quite the eye,\u201d he complimented deliberately.</p><p>Chester narrowed his eyes and pointed his finger in Zane\u2019s direction, wagging it at him threateningly. \u201cSmartass, eh?\u201d he asked knowingly. \u201cI ain\u2019t sure I like you,\u201d Chester claimed as his eyes narrowed further.</p><p>\u201cHow about breakfast, Ma?\u201d Ty asked as he leaned forward and tried to distract his grandfather with the movement.</p><p>She responded by thumping a plate in front of Chester and sitting down with a huff. \u201cAmen,\u201d she said in annoyance before beginning to dish eggs onto her own plate.</p><p>Ty glanced over at Zane and smiled at him, giving him a quick wink. Zane returned the grin and reached for the biscuits, taking two before passing the plate to Ty. Ty\u2019s knee occasionally brushed against his under the table as they ate, but the conversation died down as the food was passed around. It was an odd, remarkable feeling, to be eating breakfast with Ty and his family and feel not only welcome, but like he might belong there.</p><p>It was a feeling Zane tried to soak in and store for later.</p><p>When the breakfast was mostly over, Ty stood and scooped up the empty dishes off the table. They clattered as he dumped them in the sink. \u201cAre we going to sit here all day, or are we going up the mountain?\u201d he asked as he ran hot water.</p> <p>The corners of Zane\u2019s lips turned up, and he turned in his chair to look at his partner. \u201cWaiting on you, bus boy.\u201d</p><p>Mara walked by and smacked Zane lightly in the back of the head for his trouble. \u201cBe nice,\u201d she chastised as she walked out of the kitchen. Zane just smiled.</p><p>Ty laughed softly, turned back to the sink, and rinsed his hands. \u201cIf we don\u2019t go now, we might as well wait \u2019til tomorrow,\u201d he added as he grabbed a dishtowel to dry his hands.</p><p>\u201cGot a garage roof needs patching,\u201d Earl suggested as he poured himself more coffee.</p><p>Deuce stood hastily and made his way out of the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ll start packing up the truck!\u201d he called as he went.</p><p>\u201cMy duffel\u2019s packed,\u201d Zane told Ty with a shrug. He already had on jeans and boots along with his thin T-shirt covered by a long-sleeved Henley.</p><p>Earl grunted and pushed away from the table. \u201cWe\u2019ll just patch that roof next time,\u201d he said to Ty with a smile before he strolled out of the kitchen, mug in hand.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat, snorted in annoyance, and looked at Zane with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve left your ass in DC,\u201d Ty muttered to him as he pushed away from the sink counter and moved slowly toward the table where Zane sat. He cocked his head to listen briefly, and then he bent and stole a surprise kiss before leaving the room.</p><p>Zane licked his bottom lip as he stood. He was smiling when he followed.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>THEY said their good-byes to Mara at the trailhead, each giving her a hug and a kiss\u2014even Zane, Deuce noticed\u2014and they each shouldered their packs. Deuce examined his walking stick, a long, thick piece of wood that had been hand-rubbed and stained dark. It had a length of survival rope tied around the top as a handle, and fixed into the wood of the tip was a small compass.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a walking stick,\u201d Zane said, coming to a stop to stand next to him as he zipped up his heavy coat. He had Deuce\u2019s old pack hanging off his broad shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Deuce agreed readily. \u201cTy made it for me. Saw one at a gun show somewhere and thought it might come in handy.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cThoughtful,\u201d he said more genuinely.</p><p>\u201cHe can be,\u201d Deuce answered as he tightened the strap on his own pack.</p><p>Zane smiled a little. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he agreed, looking over to his partner, who was circling around one of the other cars in the gravel lot, frowning at it thoughtfully. \u201cSo,\u201d Zane sighed as he watched Ty for a moment. \u201cWhere are we off to? Just... up the mountain in a random direction?\u201d He glanced up into the trees, and now that Deuce really looked at him, he could tell Zane was tense. Edgy, even.</p><p>\u201cThere are several different trails we can take from this point,\u201d Deuce answered. He tugged at one of the straps of Zane\u2019s pack and shortened it for him, making certain it fit snugly to his back. Borrowing a pack was generally frowned upon on the trail because it was so important that they fit well. But Zane and Deuce were roughly the same height, and the pack wasn\u2019t too heavily laden, so Deuce wasn\u2019t worried about it. \u201cWe don\u2019t usually have a set path planned out. Just a general idea of how long it will take so Ma can pick us up at the other end. Ty\u2019s got the trail map.\u201d</p><p>Zane shot Ty a glare as Deuce spoke, and his brother just smirked evilly as he walked past them. It was easy for Deuce to see the dynamic between them. Ty and Zane seemed to get along best when they were annoying each other. They enjoyed the adversity, and Deuce was enjoying seeing all the puzzle pieces of their partnership and how they were starting to fit together.</p><p>\u201cGreat. He\u2019ll pick the worst one,\u201d Zane grumbled as Ty moved past them.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Deuce answered with certainty. \u201cHe stays away from the really bad ones when I\u2019m with him,\u201d he said with a tap of his walking stick on the ground to indicate his bad leg. Zane offered him an apologetic smile, but Deuce waved it off.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Ty asked them from where he stood at the head of the trail.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the car?\u201d Zane asked as he and Deuce moved to join him.</p><p>Ty shrugged and looked at it again. \u201cExpired inspection,\u201d he explained. \u201cBeen up here a while.\u201d</p><p>Deuce glanced over at the vehicle, wondering why Ty had even noticed and why Zane had felt the need to ask him about it. It had to be an FBI thing.</p><p>\u201cYou want to do something about it?\u201d Zane asked Ty as they all looked at the dusty car. There were several stickers on the back for the Appalachian Trail, the Shenandoah Valley, the Great Smoky Mountains, The Black Cat in Boone, North Carolina, and several others in the same vein. The owner was obviously a hiker.</p><p>\u201cTen to one the driver has a hemp wallet,\u201d Deuce said to Ty wryly.</p><p>Ty snorted and shook his head, smiling. He gave the car one last look and shrugged. Deuce figured the car probably belonged to a long-term hiker who hadn\u2019t thought ahead to have the inspection done. Ty was apparently thinking along the same lines.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let it be,\u201d Ty answered carelessly. \u201cY\u2019all ready?\u201d he asked them. Earl had already disappeared into the trees.</p><p>Zane nodded, although he did give the car one more look before he started walking. Deuce started off down the trail just ahead of him, knowing Ty would take up the rear like he always did. It often didn\u2019t matter what trail they intended to take. Earl went where he pleased. That was why they had stopped even trying to plot their course years ago.</p><p>It was quiet on the mountain, cool and peaceful and wonderful. Deuce and Ty had grown up in these mountains, and no matter how many big cities he lived in or how much money he made, Deuce would always consider this home. He glanced back at Zane and then Ty as he followed a curve in the trail. Zane was looking all around him, and it was even clearer now that he was stiff in the shoulders. Wary. On guard somehow.</p><p>Very interesting. It could be as he said, that he just wasn\u2019t accustomed to the mountains, or it could be that this was how Zane Garrett always was. Deuce didn\u2019t want to describe it as a hair trigger, but it was close.</p><p>It usually made Ty cranky when Deuce started analyzing his friends, but he just couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cIs it the trees that make you nervous or just not knowing where you\u2019re going?\u201d Deuce asked over his shoulder.</p><p>Zane glanced up at him. \u201cBoth,\u201d he said curtly, though he sighed and shrugged a little after that answer. \u201cBut I imagine I\u2019ll get used to it really quickly.\u201d</p><p>Deuce turned and glanced back at him more fully. Behind Zane, Ty was fixing a lime green buff over his head as he walked, not really paying attention to them. He had about half a dozen of them, each a different color and pattern, and he wore them underneath his straw hat to keep his ears warm and wick the sweat away from his short hair. Deuce knew he\u2019d worn them through a variety of different Recon missions, and he was never without one on the mountain.</p><p>Deuce looked back at Zane and smiled. \u201cShout if you need to stop,\u201d he advised.</p><p>\u201cCome on, ladies!\u201d Earl called from far ahead of them. \u201cNext twenty miles ain\u2019t gonna hike theirselves!\u201d</p><p>Behind him, Deuce heard Ty begin to whistle the tune to \u201cFor He\u2019s a Jolly Good Fellow.\u201d Deuce knew, though, that in his mind Ty was singing \u201cThe Bear Went over the Mountain.\u201d Deuce grinned. It was going to be an interesting hike.</p><p>IT WAS well past midday of the second day of hiking when Earl stopped them for a decent break. Ty set his pack against a towering tree and took out the trail map. He held it up and tilted it into the broken sunshine that cut through the canopy of leaves. They were going over terrain he didn\u2019t recognize, and though Earl seemed confident in where he was going, Ty\u2019s father always seemed confident in where he was going, regardless of whether he knew where he actually was.</p><p>Ty was fairly certain they were already lost.</p><p>Deuce came over as Earl and Zane sat on a fallen log near the trail, eating the last of the sandwiches Mara had wrapped tightly in wax paper and packed up for them. \u201cI think we\u2019re lost,\u201d Deuce muttered to him.</p><p>Ty snorted in amusement and nodded. \u201cThis trail here,\u201d he said, indicating the path they\u2019d been following, \u201cit\u2019s so overgrown I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been widely used in a few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink we should ask Dad if he knows where we are?\u201d Deuce asked dubiously.</p><p>Ty looked at him askance. \u201cAnd have to listen to him harp at us for not having our bearings?\u201d he posed. \u201cNot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Deuce agreed with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think this is another of his little tests, do you?\u201d Ty mumbled with a frown as he turned the trail map sideways. \u201cIs that crayon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do that when you have a stranger up here,\u201d Deuce answered with a shake of his head, ignoring the second query. \u201cWould he?\u201d he asked doubtfully.</p><p>Ty shrugged and looked up at his father and Zane as they ate in silence. To his eye, Zane looked okay; he hadn\u2019t made a single peep about them slowing down or stopping yet. He was stubborn, and he\u2019d tromped along with them gamely, even talking with Deuce about some of the places he\u2019d worked. But Ty also knew his partner still wasn\u2019t sleeping at night, and this hiking was wearing on him. Zane tried to hide it, but Ty knew what to look for after the last few weeks. Sometimes even a nice rough roll between the sheets wouldn\u2019t help Zane sleep well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane was wrong in the head somehow, and he wasn\u2019t getting better. Ty knew that was a big reason they\u2019d not been put back in the field yet. It frustrated him to no end, and that frustration was beginning to wear on their partnership in more ways than one. That was one of the reasons he\u2019d been keeping his distance; he didn\u2019t want to add any more stress to whatever Zane was dealing with, and Ty knew himself well enough to know that he caused stress even to the people who liked him.</p><p>Ty set those thoughts aside for later, hoping he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the issue at all. \u201cHey, Dad, Deuce and me are gonna scout ahead a little,\u201d he called out, thinking to give Zane a little more of a break before they headed off again. And hopefully find a clearing and a landmark or two.</p><p>Earl gave them a wave of acknowledgment as he chewed. Ty turned and gestured for Deuce to come with him.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d Deuce said as soon as they were far enough away from the others to speak freely. \u201cIs it really such a good idea to get involved with him?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ty asked with a distracted frown as he studied the surrounding area and looked down at the laminated paper in his hand. He was almost certain now a portion of the thing was drawn in crayon. They were not where they were supposed to be.</p><p>\u201cTy? Give me one minute, okay?\u201d Deuce asked, and he held up one finger to emphasize the request. Ty looked up at him in surprise, pulling his attention away from the trail map. \u201cOne minute to have a serious conversation. Then we can go back to pretending we\u2019re not lost,\u201d Deuce bargained.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty muttered warily, and he folded the map up and slid it into his pocket. \u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, all right?\u201d Deuce requested as he started walking again, using the stick Ty had carved to help him. \u201cHe seems like an okay guy. He\u2019s kinda... twitchy, but then so are you. And if you\u2019re going to be involved with a guy, I\u2019d rather it be someone who can kick your ass,\u201d he informed Ty seriously. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen what you do to the people you\u2019re fucking, man. They fall for you; you dump them; they have a nervous breakdown. What happens when it ends? Can you request a new partner because of personal issues?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt won\u2019t go that far,\u201d Ty scoffed as he caught up to his brother and walked beside him with his head down, watching the trail. \u201cAnd I do not give people nervous breakdowns,\u201d he added in an insulted voice. He glanced up to catch Deuce\u2019s disbelieving eye, and he shrugged defensively.</p><p>\u201cYou saying your relationship with him is purely professional?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty answered stubbornly.</p><p>Deuce stopped walking and shook his head. Ty moved until he was standing in front of him. \u201cYou\u2019re full of shit,\u201d Deuce accused with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not new,\u201d Ty argued.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying if you weren\u2019t fucking him any longer, you\u2019d still be okay working with him,\u201d Deuce posed, unwilling to be driven off track.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty answered in annoyance. \u201cYou a couples therapist all of a sudden?\u201d Deuce snorted and began laughing. \u201cReally,\u201d Ty grunted as he turned away.</p><p>\u201cYou know how lovers\u2019 spats get, Ty,\u201d Deuce called after him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no love involved,\u201d Ty insisted as he turned back around and glared at Deuce.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not for you,\u201d Deuce pointed out. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett?\u201d Ty asked, his voice rising in tone. \u201cHe\u2019s not in love with me; are you kidding? He can barely stand me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove and like are two entirely different things, Tyler,\u201d Deuce said knowingly as he started moving again.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, save it for your clients,\u201d Ty muttered as he followed. His brother responded with a delighted whistle, and Ty shook his head, trying not to let on how disturbed he was by the discussion. Deuce was even more perceptive than Ty, a skill that served his brother well in his chosen profession. But there was no reason to think Deuce was right in regards to Zane. Ty knew his partner better than Deuce did. Zane had already known the love of his life, and he wasn\u2019t looking for another one. What that spelled out for them was absolutely nothing but enjoying the here and now.</p><p>Zane would no more fall in love with Ty than he would sprout wings and fly.</p> <p>ZANE watched the brothers tromp off down a trail. He could hear them talking for a few moments, but then they were too far away.</p><p>\u201cThey seem close,\u201d Zane observed, shifting on the log to lean his elbows on his knees as he studied the greenery under his boots.</p><p>\u201cThey were tied together like a knot when they were little,\u201d Earl confirmed. \u201cCaused all kinds of hell. But then, Grady brothers always have. Been that way since my daddy and his brothers was little.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled. Trouble ran in the family, obviously. \u201cAlways wondered what it\u2019d be like to have a brother,\u201d he confided in Earl.</p><p>\u201cWell, you practically got one now,\u201d Earl pointed out as he gestured with his half-eaten sandwich.</p><p>Glancing at the older man, Zane tipped his head as he turned the half of his sandwich on its side to take another bite. \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t exactly call his relationship with Ty a brotherly one. But then, they were in West Virginia.... His lips quirked before he took a bite, aware of Earl\u2019s scrutiny and trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cDick tells me you took care of my boy,\u201d Earl said a full minute later.</p><p>Zane slowly lifted his gaze to meet his eyes but didn\u2019t comment. He didn\u2019t want to talk about New York with anyone\u2014and definitely not with Ty\u2019s father. Earl nodded, that look about him like he felt he might have an idea of what they\u2019d dealt with. \u201cBad enough you don\u2019t want to talk about it, huh?\u201d Zane swallowed hard and reached for his canteen, looking blankly out into the forest. \u201cYou military, Garrett?\u201d</p><p>The abrupt change in the line of questioning threw Zane for a second. He figured at that moment that he ought to have expected it. All the Gradys did that jump-the-tracks train of thought thing; he suspected it was a way to throw their quarry off guard. It worked, he thought with a sniff. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d Earl commented sincerely.</p><p>Zane frowned and turned his chin back. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilitary gives you a state of mind to deal with those kind of things,\u201d Earl told him sympathetically. \u201cMan ain\u2019t made to deal without help.\u201d</p><p>Zane had to admit the man had a point. Truth was, he wasn\u2019t handling parts of his job-related past well, even with outside help. But the comment rankled, regardless. \u201cJust because I\u2019m not military doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t handle the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say you couldn\u2019t, son,\u201d Earl told him evenly.</p><p>Zane nodded slowly, finishing the last couple bites of his sandwich and watching as Earl stood and walked a few steps away. Zane tipped his head to one side. He hadn\u2019t quite figured out how to take Earl Grady yet.</p><p>\u201cDamn fool boy needs someone on his six,\u201d Earl murmured as he looked out into the woods where Ty and Deuce had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cTy\u2019s very good at his job,\u201d Zane defended quietly.</p><p>Earl nodded and turned back to him. \u201cYes, he is. You know anything about tracking?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Zane raised an amused eyebrow, acknowledging another jump in the tracks. \u201cNot on a mountain,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cWhere then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a city. The Texas flats where I grew up. Or on a computer.\u201d</p><p>Earl wrinkled his nose. \u201cComputers,\u201d he repeated with a shake of his head. \u201cCan\u2019t wrap my mind around them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re the new frontier,\u201d Zane told him wryly. \u201cNot many places like this left,\u201d he said, pointing his finger up and circling.</p><p>\u201cMountains, they got their dangers, just like anywhere else. I been a lot of places. So has Ty. But these mountains are in my blood, and they\u2019re in Ty\u2019s blood too.\u201d Earl went quiet, looking around them speculatively. \u201cThey\u2019ve served Tyler well,\u201d he finally decided. \u201cIf you can survive here, you can survive just about anywhere,\u201d he claimed.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll find out then,\u201d Zane finally answered. \u201cBut you won\u2019t be carrying my ass out,\u201d he said with a slight smile, echoing a comment Earl had made about one of Ty\u2019s Recon friends.</p><p>Earl snorted. \u201cWe\u2019ll see shortly,\u201d he said with a smirk.</p><p>A little bothered, Zane slid his empty sandwich wrapper in his bag and stood up, pacing away to the edge of the clearing. He didn\u2019t like the constant air of doubt Earl exuded, as if he wasn\u2019t quite sure Zane\u2014or any of them, for that matter\u2014was capable of doing what needed to be done. It was similar to the attitude Ty\u2019d had toward him when they\u2019d first met.</p><p>He stood in place for a while, arms crossed, looking down the hillside at the thick undergrowth that rambled over rocks and broken trees about ten feet below them, doing his best to zone out and listen to the woods around him. After several minutes, he took a slow, deep breath, sighed, and went to move, but he paused as a small mouse darted out of the brush and dodged around his feet before disappearing again. Zane nearly chuckled until more movement caught his eyes, and he looked down.</p><p>\u201cEarl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, please.\u201d</p><p>Earl walked up behind him, and Zane pointed down.</p><p>There was a snake sliding out of the brush, its nearly camouflaged brown body stretching out as it slithered near one of Zane\u2019s boots, intent on the mouse it had been stalking. It kept moving, and Zane\u2019s eyes widened as the snake got longer and thicker.</p><p>\u201dNever seen a snake before?\u201d Earl asked as he frowned and squinted at it. \u201cCold for her to be out.\u201d</p><p>Zane turned a disbelieving glare on him. \u201cIs this particular one dangerous or can I kick it away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a rattler, boy,\u201d Earl said with a careless wave of his hand. \u201cYou just wait \u2019til she decides to move and hope she don\u2019t startle,\u201d he advised, as if it were the easiest thing in the world to just stand there while a poisonous snake slid around your ankle. \u201cShe knows you\u2019re there already; she can see heat.\u201d</p><p>Just at that moment, the snake coiled itself and raised its head, its tail moving and emitting the rattling sound Zane was all too familiar with from growing up on a horse ranch in Texas.</p><p>\u201cNow she\u2019s pissed,\u201d Earl observed calmly, taking a cautious step backward. \u201cThem boots of yours leather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeather and canvas,\u201d Zane answered, swallowing. But that wasn\u2019t going to help if she bit above them. She was within easy striking distance of his knees.</p><p>\u201cThat there\u2019s a timber rattler. Pretty rare. Not usually mean, but you must have interrupted her dinner,\u201d Earl said, keeping his voice down. \u201cReal poisonous. But don\u2019t worry,\u201d he was sure to add. \u201cUsually when a snake strikes defensively it\u2019s a dry bite.\u201d Zane glanced at him quickly. \u201cMeans they don\u2019t load up no venom before they bite,\u201d Earl explained, as if he was teaching a class rather than talking to a man about to be bitten by a snake.</p><p>Zane grimaced. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to take that chance, thanks. So what now?\u201d he asked as he eyed the snake that was coiled in front of him and still rattling. \u201cI can\u2019t shoot the damn thing.\u201d He very slowly uncrossed his arms, his right hand settling at his left wrist. He was pretty sure his knife wouldn\u2019t help either, but it made him feel better regardless.</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re endangered. Can\u2019t kill her. Don\u2019t move,\u201d Earl warned. He moved closer and circled behind the snake as the rattling became louder, but Zane wasn\u2019t about to turn his head to see what the man was doing.</p><p>\u201cFucking vacation,\u201d Zane said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d Earl barked suddenly.</p><p>As Zane shifted his weight and jumped sideways, away from the snake, it went after him, striking fast. Earl grabbed at it as it lunged through the air, its momentum making it impossible for the five-foot long snake to do anything but hiss and curl its body around Earl\u2019s hand as he held onto it, just below its widened jaws.</p><p>Zane stared at him, both appalled and impressed.</p><p>\u201cGot to catch \u2019em below the teeth,\u201d Earl advised calmly as he carefully unwrapped the snake from his wrist and then tossed it with both hands into the underbrush, sending it sliding down the rocky hillside unharmed, away from them. \u201cYou all right?\u201d Earl asked him as he turned to look at him.</p><p>Zane nodded numbly. Ty joked about West Virginia snake charmers sometimes. Zane had never taken him seriously, though. Maybe he should start. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Earl grunted and took a few steps to peer down the hill. Zane stayed back\u2014no way was he tempting fate again. In Texas the general wisdom was that snakes traveled in pairs.</p><p>\u201cJust a last big dinner before winter. Thought we wanted it,\u201d Earl drawled carelessly. \u201cWarning us off is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it succeeded,\u201d Zane said vehemently.</p><p>Earl just chuckled. Before Zane could say anything more, Earl frowned and squatted down, moving aside some fronds of a ground fern.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Zane asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cLook at this,\u201d Earl said.</p><p>Zane went to stand behind Earl and look over his shoulder. But he kept one hand on his knife, just in case.</p><p>\u201cSO IF you\u2019re not emotionally invested in this guy, why\u2019d you bring him up here?\u201d Deuce asked as he caught up to Ty again.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so interested?\u201d Ty asked desperately, wishing his brother would just back off for once. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re my brother,\u201d Deuce answered as he grabbed at Ty\u2019s elbow to stop him. \u201cAnd I enjoy watching you squirm,\u201d he added as Ty glared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou want the truth?\u201d Ty asked in frustration.</p><p>\u201cNo, Beaumont, I want you to lie to me,\u201d Deuce replied drolly.</p> <p>Ty gave him a hard punch to the bicep in retaliation, and Deuce yipped and stumbled a bit, laughing as he grabbed for his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re a jackass, Deacon,\u201d Ty said with a grunt. \u201cDon\u2019t you tell him my given name,\u201d he threatened seriously.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Deuce agreed, still laughing. \u201cAnswer the question, Ty. You\u2019re never this stubborn unless you\u2019re trying to hide something. You\u2019re in love with him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he stated with a hint of surprise.</p><p>Ty sighed and looked away, staring out at the rise and fall of the mountain ridge through the breaks in the tree line. To this point, he\u2019d been able to tell himself that Zane was nothing more than a friend and partner. Ty had never been in love. He didn\u2019t know what it was, and so he couldn\u2019t say for sure. He pressed his lips together and lowered his head. He rarely lied to Deuce, and he saw no reason to start now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ty said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I love him or not. I think... I think I could if he let me,\u201d he said, admitting more to Deuce than he\u2019d even been willing to admit to himself. \u201cBut that has nothing to do with why he\u2019s here,\u201d he insisted as Deuce opened his mouth to speak. \u201cDick is on the verge of forcing Garrett into an early retirement,\u201d he told Deuce softly, looking around the trail at their surroundings as if someone might overhear them.</p><p>Finally thrown off the scent, Deuce straightened in surprise and took a step closer to Ty, lowering his voice when he spoke. \u201cWhat\u2019s the reason?\u201d he asked curiously.</p> <p>After a moment of hesitation, Ty answered regretfully. \u201cOur last case did a number on him. He\u2019s bombing his evals.\u201d It felt wrong, telling anyone about Zane\u2019s situation. Hell, it had felt wrong hearing about Zane\u2019s situation. But he trusted his brother, and he was hoping Deuce might be able to help. He was a trained psychiatrist, after all, and that was exactly what Zane needed, in Ty\u2019s opinion.</p><p>\u201cWhich evals?\u201d Deuce asked, and Ty could practically see him switching over into professional mode.</p><p>It had always annoyed Ty before, but now it was almost a relief. \u201cPsych ones mostly,\u201d he answered with a small huff.</p><p>\u201cHe seems pretty grounded,\u201d Deuce observed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an... ongoing thing,\u201d Ty answered. \u201cThings from the past piling up. Then that car wreck in New York?\u201d</p><p>Deuce nodded, not commenting on the fact that Ty hadn\u2019t called home to inform them about that whole ordeal until after he\u2019d been released from the hospital.</p> <p>\u201cHe got pretty torn up. And he doesn\u2019t know I know, but he ended up having to kill the man we were hunting. Then he got tossed back into an undercover gig that he wasn\u2019t ready for and didn\u2019t want, and there\u2019s drugs and alcohol and all kinds of shit involved from his past. He cleaned up but... it... he\u2019s not dealing well. He tries to hide it, but he\u2019s not,\u201d Ty went on in frustration.</p><p>\u201cYou brought him here for me to talk with him?\u201d Deuce asked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cNot... really,\u201d Ty answered with a wince.</p><p>Deuce was silent, staring at him, and soon Ty lowered his head, unable to look his brother in the eye. \u201cDid Dick order you to bring him here?\u201d Deuce asked uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cNo, that was all me,\u201d Ty corrected.</p><p>\u201cBut Dick ordered you here,\u201d Deuce reminded.</p><p>\u201cIt was a suggestion,\u201d Ty argued.</p><p>\u201cA suggestion,\u201d Deuce repeated dubiously.</p> <p>\u201cA mild suggestion,\u201d Ty said with a nod of his head.</p><p>Deuce snorted. \u201cThe last mild suggestion Dick gave you sent you to Cuba,\u201d he reminded.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I kind of enjoyed Cuba,\u201d Ty muttered as he looked away and squinted back in the direction they\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cI assume he doesn\u2019t know this?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Dick knows I enjoyed Cuba,\u201d Ty said with a smirk he couldn\u2019t hold back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about Zane, numbnuts,\u201d Deuce said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t try to confuse me, I\u2019m immune,\u201d he added. Ty sighed and looked back at his feet. \u201cDoes Zane know why he\u2019s here?\u201d Deuce prodded.</p><p>Ty shook his head and looked up at his brother pleadingly. \u201cI told him I wanted him to come along to run interference with the family. That was the original idea, actually, but the more I thought about it on the way up, the more I thought maybe you could help. I don\u2019t know what else to do. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll let me help him.\u201d</p><p>Deuce was silent, studying Ty for a few minutes. Finally he nodded, taking pity. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ty said in relief.</p><p>\u201cTy! Deuce!\u201d Earl called out suddenly, his deep voice echoing in the thick woods. The tone of his voice caused Ty to turn and run instantly, leaving Deuce to keep up with him as best he could on his bad leg.</p><p>Ty skidded into the clearing where they\u2019d been resting, and he glanced around until he saw his father crouched in the woods at the edge of the clearing, looking down at the ground. Zane was standing behind him, and they wore matching frowns.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty demanded irritably as his heart began to calm. Deuce clambered out of the woods behind him and ran into him, almost toppling them both to the ground.</p><p>\u201cQuit messin\u2019 around and come look at this,\u201d Earl requested calmly. Ty shoved Deuce gently before stomping over to join his father.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d he requested as he knelt beside Earl.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Earl asked in confusion.</p><p>Ty just shook his head. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Earl pointed at a track in the dried mud in front of him. He was pulling the leaves of an overgrown plant away in order to see it, and Ty wondered briefly how he\u2019d even found the tracks to start with. They were standing only a couple feet from a drop-off to a creek in a ravine.</p><p>\u201cIs that from an ATV?\u201d Deuce asked as he leaned over them, his hands on his knees.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a tire mark of some sort,\u201d Ty murmured as he looked up and over his shoulder, peering into the woods in the direction the track headed. Motorized vehicles of any sort were illegal up here. Even bicycles weren\u2019t allowed. So it was a concern to find a track like this. His eyes scanned the trees and underbrush, looking for signs of recent passage. An ATV trail wasn\u2019t hard to follow, but Ty could see no broken twigs or brushed leaves in the area, much less any more tracks.</p><p>\u201cThis is a pretty old track,\u201d he finally decided as his brother and father waited for him to speak. They knew his abilities, and they were willing to defer to him even though both men had been raised in these mountains as well. His father had been used as a tracker in Vietnam because of his skills, and he had taught his boys everything he knew. Ty had merely had more opportunity to hone the talent.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last heavy rain up here?\u201d he asked his dad.</p><p>\u201cBeen about two weeks, to my knowledge,\u201d Earl answered thoughtfully. He gently replaced the fronds of the little fern he\u2019d been holding back, and he and Ty both cocked their heads in the same manner as they looked down at the track beneath. \u201cIt was made before the rain,\u201d Earl realized as Ty nodded in agreement. \u201cPlant protected it from being washed away,\u201d he told Zane as he stood and stretched his back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll report it when we hit the ranger station, all the same,\u201d Ty told them as he stood as well. \u201cPerson on an ATV up here is either up to no good or they\u2019re gonna get hurt,\u201d he said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how a four-wheeler would get up here at all,\u201d Zane said. \u201cSo much of the woods, the paths are too narrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t care about trampling the underbrush or getting clotheslined by the occasional low-hanging branch, you can do it,\u201d Deuce told him wryly as he stood with one hand on his hip. He looked over at Ty. \u201cAre you worried?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ty frowned thoughtfully but finally shook his head. \u201cMarijuana, probably. Could be moonshine, but I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll stop in at the ranger station, give them a location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll just kick it off to you Feds,\u201d Earl pointed out.</p><p>\u201cDad, if I call Dick with a case, even something like this, when I\u2019m supposed to be on vacation, he will skin me alive,\u201d Ty pointed out. \u201cBesides, what do you want me to do? Track them through the back country and take them on with Deuce\u2019s walking stick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a smartass,\u201d Earl warned as he turned away and headed toward his pack. \u201cWatch out for the snake,\u201d he added as he went.</p><p>\u201cSnake?\u201d Ty asked in confusion, glancing at Deuce and then Zane, who was shaking his head as he walked away.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>\u201cWE\u2019RE a few hours behind schedule,\u201d Deuce informed the group as Ty and Zane hunched over the fire and warmed their stiff fingers. Ty looked up at his brother and snarled quietly.</p><p>Zane knew it had gotten much colder than they had anticipated, and it was sapping their energy at a dangerous rate. It was only the second night, but they were all dragging a little. The last ridge they\u2019d topped before stopping for the night had revealed snow on the highest peaks, and Ty had gone so far as to tell Zane he was beginning to fear it would get worse before they could find the appropriate shelter. That wasn\u2019t reassuring.</p><p>At least it was cold enough that surely no snakes would be out at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to scout ahead a little,\u201d Earl told them. He was screwing the top onto a Thermos of hot coffee he\u2019d boiled over the fire and looking off into the woods that awaited them. \u201cGet clear of the roof and smell what the weather looks like,\u201d he went on as he looked up at the thick canopy of trees.</p><p>Zane looked up as well, only catching glimpses of the gray evening sky between the layers of colored foliage barely illuminated by the fire. He\u2019d almost gotten used to the feeling of being underneath a huge tent that happened to move and sway with the wind.</p><p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t get to the next shelter in a day\u2019s trek, we might think about turning back,\u201d Earl was saying. \u201cKeep to the lower elevation and familiar ground. Ty, load up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Ty murmured as he stood again and began to extract things from his pack quickly.</p><p>\u201cCatch up,\u201d Earl instructed as he headed off into the woods with his flashlight and canteen.</p><p>Ty glanced up and sighed in exasperation. \u201cDamn fool, can\u2019t even wait for me to lighten my damn pack,\u201d he muttered under his breath as he knelt and moved faster. \u201cFamiliar ground, my ass,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>Zane watched him, wondering about the relationship Earl Grady had with his sons. He seemed pretty good-natured and easygoing, and so did Deuce, for the most part. Although he wouldn\u2019t describe Ty that way on the whole, they all seemed to get along just fine and have a great deal of respect for each other. But when Earl gave an order, both Ty and Deuce jumped to obey it as quickly as possible. Easygoing or not, somewhere along the way Earl Grady had taught his sons to do as they were told without questioning it. Zane wasn\u2019t sure what he thought of that, and it was definitely odd to see Ty like this. Ty mumbled something to them Zane didn\u2019t quite catch before heading off into the dark woods after his father.</p><p>Zane leaned back against a rock that lined the clearing where they\u2019d made camp for the night and stretched out his legs with a wince. He was in really good physical shape\u2014lots of hours in the gym to offset all the sitting at a desk\u2014but the hard hiking wasn\u2019t like running on a treadmill or lifting weights. He had kinks in his back from carrying the backpack that were bugging him.</p><p>The fire was putting out good heat now, so he pulled off his heavy jacket and set it to the side, not wanting to get overheated. Grumbling to himself a little, he twisted carefully from side to side to pop his back and then his neck.</p><p>He was tired. Bone tired, even. Maybe he\u2019d be able to sleep more than a few hours tonight. He yawned, but movement to his side drew his attention. Zane flicked his eyes to his left to see Deuce rambling across the campsite. He was carrying an armload of small sticks and brush to fuel the fire, and he happily dumped them onto Ty\u2019s bedroll as Zane watched him.</p><p>He straightened and turned to meet Zane\u2019s eyes, and he cocked his head curiously when he saw him sitting there. He glanced off in the direction Ty and Earl had gone and began moving toward him. Deuce knelt beside Zane with a smile and then allowed himself to fall into a seated position in front of the fire.</p><p>\u201cTired, huh?\u201d he asked knowingly.</p><p>Zane let himself smile a little as he slumped. \u201cWhat gave me away?\u201d</p><p>Deuce shrugged. \u201cYou have that \u2018please carry me\u2019 look to you.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cSeen that a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a mirror,\u201d Deuce answered with a laugh. He unscrewed the cap to his canteen and gave Zane a measuring look. \u201cWhy\u2019d you come up here with Ty?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Holding Deuce\u2019s eyes, Zane silently acknowledged the talk that had been pending. \u201cHe asked me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m betting he asks you to do a lot of things,\u201d Deuce wagered.</p><p>Zane shook his head briefly. \u201cYou\u2019d lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Deuce responded in genuine surprise. \u201cInteresting,\u201d he murmured as he again looked out to where Ty and Earl had disappeared down the trail. After a moment, he shook his head and looked back at Zane. \u201cYou like your job?\u201d he asked suddenly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane was still amused by the now-trademarked \u201cinteresting.\u201d \u201cSometimes. Not as much as I used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain can color a lot of things,\u201d Deuce pointed out with a nod.</p><p>Zane nodded. \u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed.</p> <p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been hurt on the job, would you enjoy it more?\u201d Deuce asked thoughtfully.</p><p>Zane considered whom he was talking to. This was Ty\u2019s brother, after all, not just some random bureau psychiatrist. \u201cNo,\u201d he admitted quietly.</p><p>Deuce pursed his lips and nodded. Then he leaned toward Zane slightly. \u201cIs Ty a good partner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou were there when I told your mom about Ty being a good partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you told my mom,\u201d Deuce pointed out. \u201cI\u2019m asking for the real answer.\u201d</p> <p>Zane frowned slightly, not sure what Deuce wanted to hear. \u201cWhy would I lie about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s a good partner,\u201d Deuce concluded with a nod. He looked at Zane unflinchingly, studying him. \u201cAre you?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>Zane was a little surprised by the question. \u201cI hope so. \u201c</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Deuce agreed with a shrug of one shoulder and a smile. \u201cBut are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Zane answered defensively.</p><p>\u201cSure you do. You know what it takes. Are you someone you\u2019d be comfortable putting your back to in a fight?\u201d</p> <p>Zane caught himself pausing. He\u2019d been wrestling with his fears a lot in the form of nightmares, especially the fear of losing someone close to him. In the past, it had been Becky. Right now, it meant Ty. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not a good partner,\u201d Deuce translated for himself. \u201cVery interesting.\u201d</p><p>Zane pressed his lips together, embarrassed and at a loss for words. \u201cHas anyone ever threatened you over saying that word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I recall,\u201d Deuce answered sincerely. He was still smiling at Zane thoughtfully. \u201cAs a shrink, we\u2019re trained to listen and ask the relevant questions, not so much give advice,\u201d he confided in Zane.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like to be called a shrink,\u201d Zane said with a weak smile.</p><p>\u201cIt comes and goes,\u201d Deuce admitted carelessly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to offer advice to you now despite being a shrink, okay? It\u2019s good to be honest with yourself. And harsh, to a point. After that point it gets unhealthy,\u201d he said with a wince and a shrug. \u201cBut sometimes the cold hard truth is very effective in helping yourself. I tell Ty all the time, just admit that you\u2019re an asshole and make life easier.\u201d He went on, seeming to enjoy the line of conversation and rambling happily.</p><p>Harsh truth. Zane figured the worst of his nightmares was that sometime, somewhere, he wouldn\u2019t be able to protect the people he cared about\u2014and that they\u2019d be taken away from him as a result. As to how to fix it? God only knew, because Zane sure didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOnce you admit to yourself that you are or aren\u2019t something, then you can begin searching for the reason why,\u201d Deuce went on. \u201cAnd once you\u2019ve found that, you can begin to take steps toward making it better. So, tell yourself you\u2019re an asshole, stop being an asshole, your problem\u2019s solved,\u201d Deuce said in a pleased voice. \u201cHe usually glazes over on me at that point,\u201d he added with a frown. \u201cKinda like you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s an asshole,\u201d Zane said with a small smile before he huffed quietly. \u201cHe just seems to blow things off so easily. It makes me fucking crazy.\u201d</p><p>Deuce was frowning harder and shaking his head. \u201cTy takes things to heart,\u201d he told Zane, his voice losing the light, carefree tone and becoming more serious. \u201cMost things he takes hard for about a minute, then he\u2019s moving on. Other things, they take him longer. Especially issues of fault. Failures hit him hard, but he processes them well. They don\u2019t stick to him. See, some people, they\u2019re sticky like Velcro. You\u2019re sticky. Your problems stick to you like fuzzballs from the laundry; you take them everywhere with you and people can see them plain as day. Ty, he\u2019s like spandex. Nothing sticks to him, and he\u2019s shiny on the outside.\u201d</p><p>Zane knew he was staring at Deuce oddly, but he couldn\u2019t stop himself. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s worse, that you just said that or that it actually made sense.\u201d</p><p>Deuce winked at him and grinned. \u201cYou just have to pick off the fuzzballs,\u201d he advised.</p><p>\u201cI never was really good with laundry,\u201d Zane said with a self-deprecating laugh. \u201cNot really good with dealing with \u2018things\u2019, either.\u201d</p><p>Deuce hummed in response. \u201cMaybe if you tried doing the laundry more often, you\u2019d be a better partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we continuing the laundry analogy for the laugh factor?\u201d Zane asked as he wrinkled his nose. \u201cIf we are, I\u2019ll say I\u2019d rather dump it all at the dry cleaners and forget about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want a tiny little Oriental guy dealing with your fuzzballs,\u201d Deuce argued, barely restraining a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my better analogies,\u201d he went on, his grin widening as Zane did laugh. \u201cI should write it down.\u201d He paused for a long moment. \u201cAm I making any headway here?\u201d he asked seriously.</p><p>\u201cI hear what you\u2019re saying. But it\u2019s nothing I didn\u2019t already know,\u201d Zane said. He knew what was wrong. He just didn\u2019t know how to fix it, so he\u2019d taken to ignoring it.</p><p>Deuce nodded in understanding. \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is you don\u2019t mind being a bad partner to a man you claim is a great one.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s face went very still as a flash of pain streaked through his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve been a good partner when it counted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt always counts, Zane,\u201d Deuce murmured gently.</p><p>Zane sighed, dropped his eyes, and then closed them for good measure. \u201cYeah,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Deuce reached out and patted him on the foot. \u201cWe went over the whats. You ever want to get into the whys, you know where to find me,\u201d he offered.</p><p>After managing to get a breath into his lungs, Zane looked up at Deuce. He thought he should say something, but there just wasn\u2019t anything to be said. He settled on nodding and smiling weakly.</p><p>Deuce smiled lopsidedly at him. \u201cGood, now help me up,\u201d he requested as he held out a hand. \u201cLeg\u2019ll let me get down, but it\u2019s no damn help getting back up. I just roll around like a turtle on its shell \u2019til somebody shoves me with a stick.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but snort and smile. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m in much better shape,\u201d he admitted. \u201cYour dad sets a fast pace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe always has,\u201d Deuce acknowledged.</p><p>Zane snorted, got to his feet fairly easily, and then offered Deuce an arm. Deuce clasped his wrist in a hard grip, and he pulled himself to his feet with Zane\u2019s help. He clapped Zane on the back and turned to head for the tree line again to gather more firewood.</p><p>Zane watched him limp away. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, what happened?\u201d he asked impulsively.</p><p>Deuce turned and looked back at him with a raised eyebrow. \u201cWhat happened to my leg, you mean?\u201d he asked to clarify. He patted his thigh as he turned back to face Zane. \u201cI went over the handlebars of a motorcycle,\u201d he answered with a slight smile. \u201cGot pinned between the bike and a tree. Broke all kinds of bones and tore some tendons below the knee. Couldn\u2019t be fixed to where I don\u2019t limp.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded slowly. Sounded like normal dumbass kid stuff; he\u2019d done his share. It just didn\u2019t end very well for Deuce. Then something clicked. \u201cThat\u2019s why Ty hates motorcycles, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Deuce nodded. \u201cHe gave me the bike when he went off to join the Marines. I was sixteen. He blames himself. You know the drill.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. It fit what he knew about Ty. \u201cYeah, he must. He doesn\u2019t like me riding my Valkyrie. And he\u2019s made it very clear he never will.\u201d</p><p>Deuce clucked his tongue. \u201cTy\u2019s got to place blame. He\u2019s a very black-and-white type of person. He needed something to blame for it, and instead of accepting that I was going ninety miles an hour on a dirt road and it was my fault, he blamed the bike. And himself,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut it all worked out for the best,\u201d he claimed, remarkably cheerful as he spoke about what had to have been a devastating, life-altering event. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been a very good Marine,\u201d he mused. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the route I would have taken, right down the path he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love him a lot,\u201d Zane murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my brother,\u201d Deuce answered, as if that should be obvious.</p><p>Zane nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Deuce asked without looking away.</p><p>Zane held Deuce\u2019s gaze as his lips quirked into a wry smile, and he had to go with his honest, gut answer. \u201cNo,\u201d he said softly, a slight tinge of regret in his voice.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Deuce responded in genuine interest. \u201cI would have guessed otherwise,\u201d he admitted to Zane.</p><p>Zane shrugged uncomfortably, unsure of how to respond to that. It was something he consciously avoided thinking about. \u201cI do like having the asshole around,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more than can be said for most,\u201d Deuce commented in amusement.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told,\u201d Zane agreed. He rolled his shoulders slightly, trying to shrug off some of the tension. Deuce just watched him closely, narrowing his eyes and smiling. \u201cYou look very happy with yourself,\u201d Zane observed.</p><p>Deuce glanced off into the woods again and then took a step closer to lower his voice. \u201cTry to be a better partner,\u201d he advised softly.</p><p>Zane held his gaze for a long moment. Finally he sighed. \u201cI want him around.\u201d</p><p>Deuce merely nodded again. He glanced to his side, listening briefly. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk again later,\u201d he promised as he looked back at Zane and smiled.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane said as he acknowledged Deuce\u2019s help. Deuce had zeroed in on what bothered Zane so much in under five minutes\u2014either the man was that good, or Zane felt that comfortable with him. Probably both.</p><p>He was distracted from his thoughts when he heard Ty and Earl conversing and tramping through the underbrush, coming closer. Deuce turned and limped back toward the tree line to continue his gathering.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t smell dinner cooking,\u201d Ty observed after he broke through the tree line in a different spot than where he\u2019d gone through. He tromped closer to the fire and glanced at Zane, giving him a quick second look over. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Zane blinked and shook himself. \u201cTrying to recharge.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked him up and down dubiously, but then he nodded and unshouldered his pack. \u201cAll righty,\u201d he said agreeably.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you find?\u201d Deuce asked them as he brought over another armload of wood and dumped it into Ty\u2019s bedroll.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Ty shouted with an accusing point at the firewood.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Deuce asked innocently.</p><p>Ty pointed his finger after Deuce threateningly. \u201cI will beat you like a rented mule next time Daddy ain\u2019t watching!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it on, G-man,\u201d Deuce invited with relish.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d Earl warned as he sat down on a rock near the fire. \u201cDeacon,\u201d he added, gesturing to the bedroll tiredly.</p><p>Ty and Deuce gave each other measuring looks as Deuce bent and pulled the bedroll out from under the woodpile. He held it up and waved it. \u201cSee? Good as new,\u201d he claimed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna wake up with a snake in your jeans,\u201d Ty growled softly.</p><p>\u201cToo cold for snakes,\u201d Deuce reminded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with the snakes again,\u201d Zane said plaintively, getting a chuckle out of Earl.</p><p>\u201cChipmunk then,\u201d Ty decided.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of chipmunks,\u201d Deuce told him with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYeah, \u2019cause they\u2019re... twitchy!\u201d Ty explained with a little gesture of his hands.</p><p>Deuce laughed harder and waved him off. They were both smiling, though, and Zane could tell the little scene was a familiar one for them.</p><p>\u201cWe can make the trail cabins if we haul it tomorrow,\u201d Earl informed them in a loud voice, getting everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cCold front\u2019s a day or so off yet; we should be clear of it before it comes through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might even hook west,\u201d Ty added seriously as he sat down beside Zane with a soft huff. \u201cBut we might not miss the rain,\u201d he added under his breath. Zane frowned and shifted uncomfortably.</p><p>Great. Cold and wet. What an awesome idea for a vacation. Next time\u2014if there was a next time, because their vacations were fucking cursed\u2014Zane was choosing, and right now a beach in Cozumel was sounding pretty damn good.</p><p>\u201cSo we go on?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>\u201cWe go on,\u201d Earl confirmed with a nod.</p><p>THEY reached the trail cabin just as darkness was falling the next evening. It hadn\u2019t been a nice leisurely stroll through the mountains like the first two days. When the rain started as Ty had predicted, they\u2019d had to double-time it in order to reach the shelter before the coming storm hit them hard, and when they finally made it through the door, they were all wet, cold, tired, and cranky.</p><p>Ty pushed back the hood of his slicker and glanced around the interior. These places were never cheerful, but this one had definitely seen better days. Desiccated leaves littered the floor because someone had left the door open last fall, and the exposed logs of the walls were all damp. The roof dripped, the floor was sagging, and there appeared to be moss growing on the outer rock of the fireplace. A fire already flickered there, though, barely warming the tiny cabin. There was a small supply of dry wood stacked in the corner that might last the night if they were careful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A man sat on one of the four bunk beds in the room, watching them sedately as they darted in from the deluge. Once Zane had slammed the door shut against the rain, the man nodded at Ty.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he greeted drolly. He was unshaven, his graying beard long and scraggly. Ty knew he was a through-hiker just from the smell. Soap wasn\u2019t an essential item when hiking from Maine to Georgia in one go.</p><p>\u201cEvening,\u201d Ty responded as he dropped his pack and struggled out of the wet slicker. He threw it aside, headed for the fireplace without another word, and hugged the rock chimney happily.</p> <p>Zane leaned back against the wall next to the door with a tired half-smile, shaking his head at Ty\u2019s antics. Earl had already dropped his bag by the other set of bunk beds, and as soon as Deuce shed his wet clothing, he claimed the lower one, sitting down hard and stretching out his leg.</p><p>Ty turned to them and shook his head. \u201cNo, no, I got the floor last time,\u201d he protested as he pointed at the bunks.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll get the floor this time because we\u2019ll offer the same arguments we did then,\u201d Deuce countered with a smile. \u201cHe\u2019s old; I\u2019m crippled; what are you gonna do?\u201d he posed carelessly as he pulled off his damp socks. Earl laughed softly and began stripping off his outer layers until he came to dry fabric.</p><p>\u201cDamnit,\u201d Ty muttered. He turned and looked at Zane critically. They would have to fight over the last bunk. And it didn\u2019t matter how accustomed to a hard surface you were, sleeping on the floor when you knew there were mattresses was unpleasant. He glanced at the bunks. Okay, well, not mattresses. But up off the floor, certainly.</p><p>Zane had set down his pack and was pulling the slicker carefully over his head. He still had to shake his head when he sprinkled water drops all over himself as he took it off. He let it fall to the floor and pulled his shoulders back, trying to stretch out.</p> <p>When he looked up at Ty, he raised an eyebrow in question. \u201cI\u2019m just going to be glad to be down for a while,\u201d Zane admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the floor.\u201d</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes, looking Zane over carefully before sighing. It came out a heavy, dejected sound. \u201cTake the bed, then,\u201d he told his partner.</p><p>\u201cQuit being a bastard,\u201d Zane said mildly as he started stripping down.</p><p>Ty huffed at him and began shedding his wet clothing as well. He delved into his pack and pulled out a tight pack of clothesline, which he attached to the walls by slipping each end onto hooks that had been mounted for the purpose. It strung along the center of the cabin, dividing the bunks from the fireplace. Then he began hanging the wet clothes on it so the fire would dry them faster. They couldn\u2019t afford to go anywhere with wet, cold clothing on.</p><p>He could hear the storm worsening outside, pounding rain on the roof and a steady trickle of water through the shingles in the corner. Ty glanced over at the man who sat watching them all quietly as Earl and Deuce followed suit with their own clothing.</p><p>Now that he\u2019d gotten the necessities out of the way, Ty could afford to be friendly. He took a step toward the bunk and offered his hand. The man took it and smiled at him. He was dry, obviously having made it to shelter before the storm broke.</p> <p>\u201cTy,\u201d Ty offered as he shook his hand. \u201cZane, Earl, Deuce,\u201d he rattled off as he pointed at each of the other men in turn.</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d the man announced in return.</p><p>\u201cMade it in before the rain?\u201d Zane said conversationally.</p><p>\u201cOnly just,\u201d John told him.</p><p>\u201cAre you hiking by yourself?\u201d Zane asked curiously.</p><p>John nodded as he crunched down on a piece of jerky.</p><p>\u201cStarted late in the season, huh?\u201d Ty wagered.</p><p>John smiled at him. \u201cStarted early, just been going slow,\u201d he told them. \u201cFigure it\u2019s my last one, so I\u2019m enjoying the sights,\u201d he said serenely as he gnawed on his jerky.</p> <p>Ty glanced to Zane. \u201cTrail goes from Maine to Georgia,\u201d he told him.</p><p>\u201cThe Appalachian Trail?\u201d Zane said, his voice rising a little toward the end. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be a couple thousand miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo thousand, one hundred and seventy-five,\u201d Ty said with a nod. He looked to John. \u201cNorth or south?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHeading south,\u201d John answered. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cJust a local thing,\u201d he answered with a smile.</p><p>John tilted his head and smiled suddenly. \u201cSo then you\u2019ll know about the Romney treasure?\u201d he asked excitedly.</p><p>Zane was staring at John. \u201cYou\u2019re hiking more than two thousand miles... for fun?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cDone it every summer for twenty years,\u201d John told him.</p><p>Zane\u2019s jaw actually dropped. \u201cThat\u2019s... incredible.\u201d John merely shrugged.</p><p>\u201cLots of folks do it,\u201d Earl told Zane quietly as he pulled out some fresh clothes from his pack. \u201cThrough-hikers. I\u2019m sorry, did you say you\u2019re looking for treasure?\u201d he asked John after a moment.</p><p>John shook his head and leaned forward in his bunk. \u201cNot looking for it, no. Just interested. Ever heard tales?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Earl just shook his head in amusement. Zane was still peering at John with a peculiar look on his face, like he thought the man must be off his rocker.</p><p>\u201cRomney,\u201d Ty repeated curiously. \u201cYou mean like the city?\u201d he asked dubiously. The mountains were full of stories about buried treasure, lost gold mines, hidden caches that were never reclaimed. It wasn\u2019t unusual to hear about them from hikers who soaked up the lore and retold it as gospel. Ty himself knew quite a bit about a few of the treasure stories in the area, but he\u2019d never heard one associated with Romney.</p><p>Muttering something about vacations under his breath, Zane stripped off his windbreaker and Henley, revealing the thinner long-sleeved shirt underneath, and dragged his bag across the small room to settle on the floor near the fireplace, leaning back against the hearth.</p><p>John scooted to the edge of his bunk and placed his elbows on his knees, looking around at all of them. \u201cYou\u2019ve never heard of the Romney treasure?\u201d he asked in disbelief.</p><p>Ty glanced over at Zane distractedly and back at John with a shake of his head. A crack of lightning outside was followed by thunder that shook the small cabin around them. It was close. Ty thought he might have gotten a whiff of ozone. Deuce gave a low whistle as he glanced up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not from here,\u201d Zane said as he studied the roof above them, looking doubtful.</p><p>John nodded as if that explained it. \u201cI teach about Appalachia back in Maine,\u201d he informed them. \u201cRomney isn\u2019t exactly on the syllabus, but it\u2019s a good story,\u201d he said hopefully. He obviously wanted to relate it. Ty figured he probably hadn\u2019t had much in the way of conversation for months.</p><p>Ty glanced over at his dad, who was watching John with a hint of a smile. It was the same look most of the locals gave a tourist when they used the word \u201cquaint,\u201d a look that said smile and humor them until they go away.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat against a laugh. \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you tell it to us while my brother makes dinner,\u201d he said with a look at Deuce.</p><p>Deuce glared at him from where he sat huddled on the lower bunk, still shivering. \u201cFine,\u201d he muttered as he unfolded himself and began getting out the makings of dinner.</p><p>John sat forward on his bunk and smiled widely. \u201cWell, as you probably know, West Virginia was just Virginia about a hundred and fifty years ago,\u201d he started.</p><p>Ty exhaled slowly. If this story started a hundred and fifty years ago, it was going to be a long night. He sat beside Zane, his back to the warm rocks of the chimney, and listened half-heartedly.</p><p>\u201cBack during the Civil War, the communities of western Virginia were sympathetic to the North, despite the state of Virginia\u2019s allegiance to the South,\u201d John was saying. \u201cMost of the fighting took place in Virginia, and the western portion was a particularly tricky spot. The South didn\u2019t want to lose it, and the North saw it as a strong position to attack Richmond from, populated with sympathizers who could offer help. The town of Romney in particular traded hands fifty-six times during the course of the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is why I slept through all my college courses,\u201d Ty muttered to Zane under his breath.</p><p>\u201cBe nice,\u201d Zane said softly. \u201cHe\u2019s harmless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like being nice,\u201d Ty reminded. Deuce cleared his throat pointedly as he handed out food.</p><p>\u201cDuring the spring of 1863, two years into the War, there was a skirmish in nearby Burlington,\u201d John told them as his eyes danced with firelight. \u201cA Confederate cavalry commander had captured twelve men of the Ringgold Cavalry. These men just happened to be the Cavalry\u2019s foraging party. Legend says this foraging party had stumbled over something, something spectacular. You know what it was?\u201d Ty and the others shook their heads in answer. \u201cNeither does anyone else, but the best guess is that it was the long lost fortune of Lord Fairfax, stolen from him in the 1700s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Lord Fairfax?\u201d Ty whispered to Zane, who shrugged and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cStolen from him?\u201d Deuce asked, whether to be polite or out of true interest Ty couldn\u2019t guess.</p><p>\u201cBy one of his land agents. Collected fees and rents that he never turned over to Fairfax. Rumor says it was hidden away until after any investigations could be done and the location was lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost and spent sound a whole lot alike,\u201d Ty muttered under his breath. Zane jabbed him in the ribs, and Ty gave a soft grunt as he leaned closer to Zane and tried not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cSome people believe that Union foraging party found it all those years later,\u201d John was saying.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the treasure that\u2019s supposedly buried up here?\u201d Earl asked doubtfully. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the Union army take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did. That foraging party, they spirited it away, dumping out their supplies and using the sacks for the gold and silver they found. They even left their ammunition behind, blinded to the danger by the treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains how they were captured in a skirmish and not killed fighting,\u201d Ty muttered as he drew a circle in the dust next to him. Zane elbowed him again gently, and Ty bit his lip against a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhen the Confederates went through their supplies, you can imagine what they thought. There was arguing over whether they should keep the money for themselves or send it to Richmond to finance the upcoming Gettysburg Campaign. They moved on to Purgitsville, where they themselves were attacked. The money changed hands again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore any official reports could be made about the money, of course,\u201d Ty interjected cynically. There were never any written records to accompany these stories.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d John agreed happily. \u201cThe Federals were then occupying Romney, and when the money reached the town, it was decided that the position wasn\u2019t secure enough to keep it there. As often as the town changed hands, you can see why.\u201d</p><p>Ty scrubbed his hand over his face. This was what being nice to people got him. Zane nudged him in the side yet again, and Ty was hard-pressed not to poke him back.</p><p>\u201cThe residents of Romney had been gradually taking their own valuables up into the mountains and hiding them, trying to keep them safe from the looting of the soldiers passing through. The man in charge of the Federal brigade, though, he had a sweetheart in Romney. The woman told him of the secret stash the town had hidden away, and one night just forty-eight hours before the town was attacked again, the Federals snuck all that gold and silver up into the mountains and hid it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that even though a whole town of people knew where this super secret hiding spot was, that it still got lost?\u201d Ty asked incredulously.</p><p>John smiled widely and nodded, as if that was his favorite part of the story. \u201cOver the summer of 1863, Romney was constantly occupied and switching hands or being watched by scouts from both armies. As winter came around, the fighting died down, but as you well know, you don\u2019t venture up into these mountains in winter no matter what kind of treasure is up here!\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane and shook his head. Zane was trying hard not to laugh at him. Ty reached between them impulsively and squeezed his hand gently. It was nice to sit there with him and enjoy something physical that wasn\u2019t even remotely sexual. He couldn\u2019t really think of a time they\u2019d even sat together like this, besides sprawling on the couch and watching post-season baseball to boo the Yankees together.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Deuce said slowly as he looked at John in confusion. \u201cWhat happened? Why didn\u2019t they ever go back for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe winter of 1863 was a harsh one,\u201d John answered. \u201cThere were collapses of caves, mudslides, flooding when the snow began to melt. It changed the topography, and so did four years of heavy fighting. The soldiers who\u2019d taken Fairfax\u2019s gold and silver up there never returned to Romney. Those who\u2019d been strong enough to drag the town\u2019s treasures up there in 1861 had all been sent off to war. They told their families how to get there, using landmarks as directions. By the time the war ended, those landmarks weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>Ty scowled heavily. He was hesitant to admit that that made a certain sort of sense. Still, he didn\u2019t put much stock in treasure stories, much less the ones that had no proof of their existence.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s up there somewhere,\u201d Earl concluded with a wave of his hand in the general direction of the peaks. He was smiling, obviously humoring the man.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the story,\u201d John answered with a pleased nod. He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019d be quite a chunk of change, anyway!\u201d he said as he pushed himself back onto his bunk and settled back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty raised an eyebrow, hoping that was it for the history lesson. Beside him, Zane shivered slightly and reached into his pack to pull out a dry sweatshirt. He had a small hand towel draped over his knee; he\u2019d obviously used it on his head because his hair was sticking up a little in a couple places. He was smiling too. He seemed pretty entertained. Ty turned to fiddle with the fire, stoking it and adding several more logs in the hopes they\u2019d last long enough for him to get some good sleep. Then he sank back down beside his partner, his shoulder brushing Zane\u2019s. He watched idly as the others moved to get their beds in order.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d he asked Zane softly.</p><p>Zane blinked heavily and looked up from where he\u2019d been staring at the floor, meeting his eyes and smiling slightly. \u201cFresh as a daisy,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, you look it,\u201d Ty drawled. \u201cLittle out of shape, huh, Garrett?\u201d he teased gently.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little.\u201d Zane played along, shifting back. \u201cThis isn\u2019t exactly like working out in the gym.\u201d He looked Ty over. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>Ty patted Zane\u2019s leg sympathetically. \u201cGot a little out of breath earlier,\u201d he answered with a quirk to his lips.</p><p>Zane chuckled. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t feel quite so bad then.\u201d He started unlacing a boot.</p><p>\u201cGet some sleep, gentlemen,\u201d Earl told them as he climbed onto the top bunk. John was already snoring loudly in his bunk.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m too tired to sleep,\u201d Deuce muttered.</p><p>Zane started in on the other boot, and he turned his head to look over at Ty. \u201cSo this is your idea of a vacation, huh?\u201d His voice was pitched very low.</p><p>Ty just smiled happily as he watched the shadows flicker around the cabin. He was in his element up here. He was happy up here, no matter how tired or cold or wet or hungry.</p><p>Apparently it was clear on his face, because Zane actually smiled genuinely. \u201cSo why not come up here more often?\u201d he whispered as he pulled off the boots.</p><p>\u201cQuit my job and become a ranger?\u201d Ty posed with a small smirk.</p><p>Zane shrugged. \u201cI can see you in one of those brown hats,\u201d he said, lips twisting against a laugh.</p> <p>Ty snorted and nodded as he tilted his head to look up at the ceiling. The fire hissed and popped, and the light danced on the logs overhead.</p><p>There were plenty of reasons Ty didn\u2019t do this more often. One was the fact that the cell reception was shitty, and Burns usually had him at the ready. It was one of the first times that Ty had thought that with a hint of bitterness.</p><p>Zane studied him with a small frown that emphasized the furrows between his brows. After a long moment, he asked, \u201cSo why not visit more?\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t move, blinking up at the ceiling as he tried to think of a way to answer. The truth was, most of his official vacation time was taken up by side jobs that weren\u2019t supposed to go in any records. But he couldn\u2019t tell Zane that even if he wanted to. Yet.</p><p>\u201cTime, I guess,\u201d he finally answered, hoping it would satisfy. He could still feel Zane\u2019s eyes on him, but the other man didn\u2019t say anything else. Ty glanced over at him self-consciously. Zane was scrutinizing him, and he looked like he was considering what to say. Ty shook his head slightly and sighed, looking back up at the ceiling. It wasn\u2019t home that was the problem. He supposed he could let Zane believe that it was, though. It would buy him some time until he figured out what to do about Burns\u2019 black ops and whether Zane needed to know about them.</p><p>\u201cTell me something,\u201d Zane asked softly, gaining Ty\u2019s attention. \u201cSomething about growing up in the mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like... more story time?\u201d Ty asked uncomfortably.</p><p>Zane shrugged one shoulder. \u201cSome good thing you remember.\u201d</p> <p>Ty watched him in the flickering firelight, frowning heavily and trying to think. \u201cGood thing about growing up in the mountains,\u201d he murmured. He shrugged, at a loss. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really all that different from growing up anywhere else, I guess. Every summer we\u2019d come up here and Dad would teach us everything he knew. From the day school was out until football started up, we were running around outdoors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll those trophies,\u201d Zane said quietly. \u201cYou played lots of sports, looked like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was decent,\u201d Ty acknowledged. \u201cI liked them all, but football was my game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not exactly lineman size,\u201d Zane commented. \u201cWide receiver? Defensive back?\u201d He smiled and bumped against him gently. \u201cQuarterback?\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced sideways at him and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll make jokes if I tell you now,\u201d he predicted.</p><p>Both Zane\u2019s brows raised. \u201cNot near what you would if I told you what I did for extracurriculars in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Ty agreed shamelessly. \u201cI was a tight end,\u201d he told Zane with another look sideways at him and a smirk. \u201cSometimes wide receiver if we were killing the other team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig guy, fast runner,\u201d Zane said with a nod.</p><p>Ty nodded, waiting for Zane\u2019s love of bad puns to seize on the tight end thing and run with it. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked to curtail the urge in his partner.</p><p>Zane snorted and rubbed a hand over his face. When he dropped it, his cheeks were surprisingly flushed. \u201cUh. Well, it was Texas, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Ty said slowly. \u201cSo... you grew up roping longhorns and riding horses?\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zane said immediately, relaxing visibly. \u201cOn Granddaddy\u2019s ranch.\u201d</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes at his partner. Zane had seized on that answer far too quickly and with too much relief, and he was obviously embarrassed about the subject. \u201cYou know, if you don\u2019t want to talk about it, I\u2019m not that big on talking anyway,\u201d Ty offered softly. \u201cI won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed. \u201cNah. It\u2019s just silly.\u201d He winced. \u201cI was on the square-dancing team.\u201d</p><p>Ty pressed his lips tightly together and closed his eyes, but he just couldn\u2019t help himself. He covered his mouth and tried to cover the laugh, shaking his head.</p><p>He heard Zane\u2019s soft laugh. \u201cI told you,\u201d Zane said with a gentle elbow to Ty\u2019s ribs. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have you know we were in the state championship my junior year.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted and laughed out loud, unable to contain it. \u201cOh God,\u201d he said as he covered his eyes. When he moved his hand, he saw Zane looking back at him, the corners of his mouth turned up slightly, but his dark brown eyes were shining in the firelight. \u201cNext time just lie to me,\u201d Ty requested as he giggled.</p><p>Zane grinned and shook his head as he hefted himself up. \u201cYou love the ammunition. Though Lord knows why I keep feeding it to you. Glutton for punishment, I guess,\u201d he mumbled as he headed for the last bunk.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Ty echoed with a soft smile.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>\u201cYOU boys make it through that storm okay?\u201d the ranger asked as he tipped his hat.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Earl confirmed.</p><p>\u201cSo you are,\u201d the ranger answered. Zane noticed that Ty wasn\u2019t paying too much attention as he dug through his bag; he seemed content to let Earl handle the conversation. It struck Zane as odd that Ty didn\u2019t want to be in control of the situation like he almost always did, but maybe he was deferring to Earl as older and wiser.</p><p>Whatever the reason, Zane didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever seen Ty this relaxed. It was an attractive attitude on him, and Zane found himself hoping Ty would stay this way once they returned home. His T-shirt this morning was a black one that claimed \u201cOnly YOU can prevent forest fires!\u201d and below that, in smaller letters, it added \u201cWhich is good because I\u2019ve got shit to do.\u201d</p><p>Zane sat smiling at his partner as he mused over just how well that fit Ty.</p><p>\u201cWe found some ATV tracks up aways,\u201d Earl was saying, and the ranger frowned.</p><p>\u201cRecent?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>Earl shook his head. \u201cNo. Back before the last storms couple weeks back, we think.\u201d</p><p>The ranger nodded slowly. \u201cWe\u2019ve had other reports the last few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the car,\u201d Zane added.</p><p>\u201cExpired inspection,\u201d Ty provided as he stopped at Earl\u2019s side. \u201cAt the trailhead. Been there a while.\u201d</p><p>Earl supplied him with the specific location, actually giving the ranger the GPS coordinates. Zane was surprised. He\u2019d not seen Earl with any sort of locator or battery-operated compass.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll check it out,\u201d the ranger said as he took out a small notepad and started scribbling in it.</p><p>Zane leaned forward, his hands braced on the bench. \u201cHow far are we from the trailhead?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout fifteen miles, as the crow flies,\u201d the ranger said.</p><p>\u201cMeans we\u2019ve probably walked fifty,\u201d Deuce muttered. His legs were extended out in front of him in a mirror of Zane\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re heading over to the nearest pass,\u201d Earl told the ranger.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had some reports of missing hikers. Searchers ain\u2019t found no sign; it\u2019s too wet, and the cold doesn\u2019t help,\u201d the ranger told him, trying to impress upon them the danger. Earl nodded again.</p><p>\u201cMissing hikers?\u201d Zane asked Deuce.</p><p>\u201cYeah, happens sometimes. Usually kids running off and being stupid,\u201d Deuce said wryly. \u201cBut sometimes a through-hiker has an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone like John,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>Deuce nodded. \u201cMore often rookies, though. Or day hikers. People like John got enough experience to know the dangers and how to avoid them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike snakes,\u201d Zane muttered, looking back over at where the ranger, Earl, and Ty were still talking.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Zane,\u201d Deuce said, clapping him on the shoulder. \u201cLike Grandpa said, it\u2019s too cold for snakes right now.\u201d</p><p>Zane resisted the urge to growl and instead stood up and stretched.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to refill our water and head out,\u201d Ty said as he walked over.</p><p>\u201cAny more storms coming?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cRanger says no. It\u2019s supposed to be clear for the next few days.\u201d</p><p>Zane must have growled that time, because Ty gave him an amused look. \u201cMan up, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sure,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019all be careful,\u201d the ranger said again, obviously not happy that they were planning to continue on. \u201cThe storm knocked out some lines and comm towers we got up there. Got no reception at all in some places. Other places it\u2019s pretty sketchy.\u201d</p><p>Ty pulled up short and turned to look at his father, raising his eyebrows in question. Earl pursed his lips, looking from Ty to the ranger again. \u201cHow\u2019s the shape of the trail?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s intact, to our knowledge. Don\u2019t know what that storm did last night. There\u2019s some flooding around, swollen rivers and mudslides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll find buried treasure in one of them,\u201d Ty muttered under his breath. Earl looked around at them, his gaze settling on Zane doubtfully. His eyes flickered to Ty again. Ty shrugged. \u201cI think we\u2019re good to go,\u201d he offered carelessly. \u201cWe\u2019re not climbing or anything,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>Earl nodded. \u201cThanks for the updates,\u201d he said to the ranger, shaking the man\u2019s hand.</p><p>As they turned to go, the ranger called out to them. \u201cKeep an eye out for snakes,\u201d he advised. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why, but they\u2019re still out and they\u2019re not happy. We think something\u2019s driving \u2019em down the mountain lately. Been lots of rattlers around.\u201d</p><p>Earl turned and smiled slightly, nodding his thanks before he walked out.</p><p>Ty made a disbelieving sound, shaking his head. \u201cSnakes,\u201d he said to Zane derisively as he passed by, snickering as he stepped through the door.</p><p>Zane just stared at him for a moment before wiping his hand over his face and following him across the dirt clearing.</p><p>He stood at the water spigot where Ty was refilling the canteens for a few minutes, watching Earl and Deuce check their packs, seeing if there were any critical supplies they might be able to get from the ranger. So Zane had at least a few quiet minutes with Ty to broach a question that had been bothering him.</p><p>\u201cEarl doesn\u2019t think I should be here, does he?\u201d Okay, it wasn\u2019t much of a question, but it got his point across.</p><p>Ty looked up at him in surprise, jerking just enough to get his hand wet and splash water over his boots. \u201cDamnit,\u201d he muttered as he looked back down to reposition the canteen. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d he asked Zane, looking up at him again.</p><p>\u201cCould be that somewhat doubtful look on his face every time he looks at me,\u201d Zane murmured.</p><p>Ty snorted and gave Zane a raspberry. \u201cHe looks at everybody like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe stated quite clearly that the military would have toughened me up,\u201d Zane added.</p><p>Ty turned off the water and straightened to his full height, frowning at Zane as he screwed the cap onto the canteen. \u201cYeah, that sounds like him,\u201d he said finally. \u201cHe\u2019s not trying to be malicious,\u201d he told Zane softly. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way he is.\u201d</p><p>Zane wasn\u2019t exactly sure about that. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a contrast to his friendly greeting when we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d Ty asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Zane murmured. \u201cI just didn\u2019t like the implication that I\u2019m not good enough to watch out for you.\u201d He took the full canteen and handed Ty an empty one.</p><p>Ty took it automatically and went about filling it as well. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you, Zane,\u201d he said as he watched the water. \u201cHe gives me the same looks he\u2019s giving you,\u201d he said without looking up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane frowned. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cI told you, that\u2019s just the way he is,\u201d he repeated, sounding a little irritated. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mean any harm by it, but until you prove yourself to him, he\u2019s going to look at you like you don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good way to describe it,\u201d Zane muttered. Then he straightened. \u201cAre you saying he still expects you to prove to him that you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d he asked in a hushed but clipped voice.</p> <p>Ty shrugged his shoulders uncomfortably and stopped the water again, standing up to fasten the cap on the canteen he held.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d Zane said softly, now feeling some real concern. And it wasn\u2019t for himself.</p><p>Ty met his eyes for a moment, either trying to think of an answer or a way to avoid any more of the conversation. \u201cDon\u2019t let it get to you,\u201d he finally advised as he handed the full canteen to Zane and took another empty one from him. Zane reached out and closed his hand loosely around Ty\u2019s wrist; Ty looked at Zane with a raised eyebrow. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked as he gave his hand a tug.</p><p>\u201cDo you follow your own advice?\u201d</p><p>Ty pulled at his hand again and glanced over to where Earl and Deuce were. He pulled Zane closer and grunted, \u201cQuit being weird.\u201d</p> <p>Zane gave him a small frown but let go of his arm. \u201cGalloping crazies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one from horse country,\u201d Ty reminded with a twitch of his lips.</p><p>\u201cYeah, takes one to know one,\u201d Zane muttered. \u201cC\u2019mon, partner. Many miles to go.\u201d</p><p>Ty grumbled as he filled the last canteen. \u201cWe\u2019re locking ourselves in a dark room for three days when we get back,\u201d he muttered, just loud enough for Zane to hear.</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Zane answered just as Earl and Deuce approached.</p><p>\u201cYou boys ready?\u201d Earl asked them as he took one of the canteens and fixed it to his pack.</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Ty answered with a sideways glance at Zane.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get moving, then,\u201d Earl said as he turned and headed off.</p><p>THEY spent the next day and a half making their way slowly up the trail, winding ever higher, going farther and farther into the backcountry where not even trail cabins interrupted the wilderness. Earl had slowed their pace to a near crawl, being careful of the treacherous trail made slick and unreliable by the most recent storms.</p><p>Every now and then Ty would check his cell phone, noting that he hadn\u2019t gotten even a hint of a signal since the storms had swept through. It made him a little nervous. He knew that you were pretty much on your own up here no matter what the conditions. You had to rely on yourself and your companions. But there was always that knowledge that help was just a day\u2019s trek away\u2014and in the last ten years or so, a phone call away.</p><p>Now they were completely cut off, out in territory none of them had ever seen before. Why Earl had picked this particular hike to go trailblazing, Ty didn\u2019t know. He and Deuce had long ago stopped trying to figure out their father\u2019s mind.</p><p>During a lag in conversation as they all concentrated on the rough terrain they traversed, Ty began to notice a distinct lack of noise. He frowned and glanced around for wildlife, finding only birds in the trees. No squirrels, no rodents, no deer in the distance. Nothing. He glanced up at the birds in confusion. If there were danger, the birds would have been long gone too. Deuce looked over his shoulder to meet Ty\u2019s eyes, obviously taking note of the unusual silence as well. They both shrugged.</p><p>Deuce turned and kept going, but Ty picked up his pace, closing in on the men ahead of him. Something was setting off his warning bells, but he wasn\u2019t quite sure what it was. Something just felt off. He tried to tell himself it was the sudden change in weather or the exertion after so long stuck behind a desk. Earl hadn\u2019t stopped moving, so maybe he wasn\u2019t noticing the unusual quiet. Ty cursed under his breath, thinking they should have just turned back when the weather broke. Just as he caught up with Deuce, Earl stopped suddenly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quiet,\u201d Earl said as he turned to look at them. \u201cMust be other hikers ahead of us,\u201d he reasoned. Ty nodded in agreement and looked back down at the trail they\u2019d just traveled. \u201cDamned litterbugs, is what they are,\u201d he heard Earl mutter under his breath.</p> <p>He looked up to see Earl bending to pick up a faded Coke can someone had tossed to the side of the trail, just under the brush. Ty gasped for a breath as the scene triggered a full-fledged flashback: Earl blurred into a Marine ahead of him bathed in the green tint of night vision, kneeling to pick up a piece of trash on the side of a desert road.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Ty shouted in warning. He rushed past Deuce and Zane, who both instinctively ducked and covered, and Ty tackled Earl to the ground just as he picked up the can. But it was too late. A string attached to something inside the can pulled and snapped as they fell, and in the brush just off the path, something clicked loudly.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Ty cried as he pushed Earl to get up off the ground. The four of them scattered, heading for cover anywhere they could find it. Just after throwing themselves over and behind a couple of fallen logs, a small explosion rocked the mountain around them, the booming sound echoing through the trees, sending debris raining down on them.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t seen nothing like that since \u2019Nam,\u201d Earl panted after a long minute.</p><p>Deuce groaned where he lay in the dirt next to Earl. \u201cYou saying Charlie\u2019s in the Appalachians trying to kill you?\u201d he asked with a hint of psychiatric concern for his father\u2019s sanity.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a smartass, Deacon,\u201d Earl snapped. \u201cI\u2019m saying that was a trap set to kill. Only thing up here worth booby-trapping is marijuana. But I ain\u2019t never seen marijuana growers use that kinda thing.\u201d</p><p>Deuce rolled and flattened on his back, extracting his cell phone to check if it had reception. He cursed. \u201cSo what the hell? What are we dealing with here?\u201d he asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t marijuana, it sure as hell ain\u2019t moonshine,\u201d Ty offered as he lay on Earl\u2019s other side, his face still pressed to the ground where he\u2019d landed. His heart was racing, and adrenaline sang through him just like it always had when explosives had been involved back in his Recon days. His head felt swimmy, and he would have sworn that if he raised it to look around, he\u2019d be looking through the lenses of night-vision goggles.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t help to jump to conclusions,\u201d Zane murmured from his sprawl next to Ty. \u201cWith the information available on the Internet, a grade-schooler would know how to create something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not just something you come up with for shits and giggles,\u201d Earl argued. \u201cThe Vietcong used to see how American soldiers liked to kick cans on the road as they marched through. They started setting up bombs set off by the kicks. That\u2019s what this reminds me of. Must have been held taut by the weight of the can, and the release when it snapped triggered it. Takes a little bit a forethought, anyway, and sure as hell means they meant to kill.\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed hard. The Vietcong weren\u2019t the only ones who\u2019d used those traps. He could still smell the stench of burnt flesh and dry heat surrounding them after that Marine had picked up that can. He breathed in the scent of the wet earth beneath him to calm himself and try to force his mind into remembering he wasn\u2019t in the desert.</p><p>\u201cWhoever or whatever we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d he said slowly as he raised his head just enough to speak without eating dirt, \u201cwe need to concentrate on getting off this mountain safely and making sure the rangers close these trails off until we can get people in here and clear this shit out. God knows how many civilians come through here every year. That trap was intentionally set to kill a do-gooder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least it\u2019s the offseason,\u201d Deuce whispered.</p><p>\u201cHow many people come up this far, anyway?\u201d Zane asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cNot many,\u201d Deuce muttered.</p><p>\u201cPicking up litter on the mountain gets you killed,\u201d Ty whispered in disgust. He reached up and carefully pulled a few dried leaves out of his mouth and made a face as he spit out some of the twigs and dirt he\u2019d practically inhaled when he\u2019d landed. He was careful not to raise his head above the log, though. And he was relieved to see the damp woods around him rather than dry sand.</p><p>\u201cWait a damn minute. Are you saying we run?\u201d Earl asked as he kept his face in the wet leaves on the ground too. Ty knew they both were dealing with memories of past battles, and Deuce and Zane followed their example.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad, we run,\u201d Ty hissed in annoyance as he glanced sideways at Earl.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you say,\u201d Earl growled back at Ty. \u201cThe four of us is more than capable of taking on some pissant little backwoods pot growers, even if they do know how to lay trap. We know the signs, what to look for. Hell, we\u2019d probably be back up here helping the search as soon as we report it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, with guns and bomb-sniffing dogs and a lot of people who are carrying first aid kits and food,\u201d Ty argued.</p><p>\u201cSomeone could get hurt up here while we run off with our tails between our legs,\u201d Earl argued in outrage. \u201cYou remember those missing hikers the ranger told us about? God knows how many people already been hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Ty said in frustration. \u201cWe have two weapons with minimum ammunition, we\u2019re on unfamiliar ground, and we have very little supplies. If one of us gets hurt bad, we\u2019ll never make it off the mountain in time. And you\u2019re not twenty-five anymore!\u201d he grated out, trying to keep his voice down.</p><p>\u201cI may be an old man, Beaumont, but at least I ain\u2019t a coward,\u201d Earl growled.</p><p>The harsh words landed with force, knocking the breath from Ty\u2019s chest and wiping away any argument he\u2019d been about to put forth. He blinked at Earl in shock before forcing himself to look away, resting his forehead against the ground again to make certain Earl wouldn\u2019t see the crushing impact the implication of the words had on him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Earl,\u201d Zane hissed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty muttered as he raised his head again. He reached up and plucked off a leaf that had stuck to his forehead, looking at it dejectedly. \u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d he told Zane as he dropped the leaf to the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn straight I am,\u201d Earl told him angrily. \u201cYou and I both got enough deaths on the conscience. We can\u2019t afford anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s four lives here to take care of,\u201d Zane snapped as he motioned among them with one hand. \u201cThat ought to register loud and clear on your conscience.\u201d</p><p>Ty pressed his lips into a thin line and nodded, not speaking in response to either statement. He began to move, pulling himself toward Deuce while still staying below the level of the log. He reached for Deuce\u2019s pack and gave him a shake of the head when Deuce opened his mouth to speak. Deuce snapped his mouth closed and glanced at the others. Then he closed his eyes and rested his cheek on the ground. Ty knew what Deuce was thinking. He was just as stunned as Ty was. They both loved and respected their father a great deal. He\u2019d always been strict and expected the very best from his sons, but Earl had never been mean, and he\u2019d never resorted to saying things that cut painfully deep in order to get his way.</p><p>Ty tried to let it slide. Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me. He shook his head as he snagged Deuce\u2019s pack, taking care to stay behind the fallen log as he pulled it close. Whoever came up with that stupid-ass rhyme deserved a few sticks and stones to the head.</p><p>He unzipped the outer pocket and extracted the small case that carried Deuce\u2019s extra set of contacts. He flipped it open and carefully lifted it, using the tiny mirror inside to peer at their back trail.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Earl asked.</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cIt appears to be an unmanned deterrent system,\u201d he reported in a low voice. He was surprised to find speaking difficult, and he cleared his throat quietly. \u201cEarly warning system, maybe. That\u2019s why it was so damn big. If there\u2019s anybody up here, they know we\u2019re here now,\u201d he decided grimly as he snapped the contact case shut and slid it back into Deuce\u2019s pack.</p><p>\u201cWhether we\u2019re going or not,\u201d Zane growled, \u201cwe need to figure out what the hell to do next. Sitting here is not safe. We need a defensible position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re coming, they\u2019ll be coming soon,\u201d Earl agreed. He raised up slightly and peered over the log. \u201cBe nice to see who we\u2019re up against from a safe distance.\u201d</p><p>Ty made his decision. \u201cI may have an idea.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>TY LAY in the underbrush, unmoving, watching the trail. He and Earl had made a makeshift ghillie suit out of a few branches and the wet, dead leaves that littered the forest floor. He\u2019d had nothing to cover his face with but dirt and debris, but it worked if he didn\u2019t move. Even blinking risked the cover as he lay near the edge of the clearing in hopes of hearing or seeing whoever came to check on the explosion.</p><p>It had been a long time since Ty had done this properly. And God, was he getting twitchy. It had only been fifteen or so minutes of lying there, and he already wanted to move. His biggest hurdle had always been the incessant rocking he did when he was tense or nervous or bored. Even lying alone in bed at night sometimes, he had to rock just to keep himself from going crazy. It wasn\u2019t nearly as bad when he was with Zane, if for no other reason than Ty forced himself to remain still so as not to disturb him. Zane slept precious little as it was, and he tended to jab Ty in the ribs when he rocked.</p><p>Luckily, he didn\u2019t have to wait much longer. A twig broke in the underbrush just yards away from where he lay. Ty resisted the urge to turn his head and check the positions of the others. He\u2019d already made certain none of them could be seen; they were further away. Ty was only this close so he could hear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly, two men moved through the overgrown foliage to his right. Ty could just barely see them out of the corner of his eye. They were both dressed in heavy, camouflage Carhartt jackets. The bigger of the two wore a hunting cap with earflaps, which were pinned up so they made him look a little like a moose in the woods. They both carried shotguns slung over their forearms and held in the crooks of their arms. Earflaps gave a low whistle as he peered out into the clearing at the crater the explosion had produced.</p><p>\u201cWe got somebody, huh?\u201d he whispered to his buddy, who nodded and looked around wordlessly.</p><p>\u201cNo body,\u201d the smaller man observed as he chewed on what looked like a plastic swizzle stick.</p> <p>Both men looked skyward, as if expecting to see a body in the trees. Ty caught himself almost rolling his eyes. They expected someone to have been blown up into the air?</p><p>\u201cMust have been a lucky one,\u201d Earflaps decided quietly. \u201dGot away,\u201d he murmured even as he turned his head and peered around the quiet forest.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes quickly and mentally cursed himself. He should have been more thorough with his camouflage. He should have known whoever was up here wouldn\u2019t be green city folks. He\u2019d underestimated their opponent already, and he damn well knew better.</p><p>\u201cLooks like he just got scared and ran,\u201d the thin, cruel-looking man with the swizzle stick said with a sneer. Ty risked opening his eyes into slits, watching through his eyelashes as Earflaps nodded wordlessly and continued to look around suspiciously. \u201cShould we follow him?\u201d he asked after a moment.</p><p>Swizzlestick shook his head and jerked his thumb over his shoulder. \u201cNo way he made it out without being hurt, and he\u2019s four days\u2019 hike from help. Mountain\u2019ll kill him before we have to. Let\u2019s get back.\u201d</p> <p>The bigger man nodded, and they both turned to slink back into the woods. They moved quietly, and Ty was impressed. They were speaking louder now, though, no longer worried about being overheard.</p><p>\u201cRadio back, let him know,\u201d Earflaps ordered. \u201cHe\u2019s all tetchy about people gettin\u2019 to his damn treasure before we do, he\u2019ll probably go nuts if he don\u2019t hear from us soon.\u201d</p><p>Swizzlestick nodded and stopped moving again. He reached for a small radio at his hip. He pushed the button and called, but got nothing but static in response. He sighed in annoyance and waved the radio. \u201cStill don\u2019t work. Must be a tower washed out somewheres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get goin\u2019, then,\u201d Earflaps said with a grunt. They pushed through the thick underbrush and disappeared into the forest once more.</p><p>Ty waited until he could no longer hear their progress. Then he waited some more.</p><p>ZANE lay still, breathing steady and low, eyes flickering about as he waited. More often than not, they moved to look about twenty feet to his right, where he knew Earl Grady was hidden. Zane gritted his teeth and forced himself to relax.</p> <p>If he thought about what the man had said to his own son, Zane wouldn\u2019t be able to stay still, because he\u2019d be over there kicking some sense into him. What kind of man called his own son a coward? Perhaps more specifically, what kind of man would call Ty Grady a coward? Zane knew without a doubt that had those words come from anyone but Earl, Ty would have taken off his head.</p><p>Zane closed his eyes. Ty hadn\u2019t been angry, though. The hurt he\u2019d seen streak across Ty\u2019s face had been heartbreaking. Zane knew he should have said more, done something, but once Ty had quietly agreed with Earl, Zane simply couldn\u2019t contradict him.</p><p>And so Zane lay there, stewing, waiting for Ty to come back from a pointless recon to see who might have set that stupid trap. And while Zane thought Earl\u2019s plan to protect innocent hikers was a lovely, shiny idea, it was also na\u00efve and dangerous.</p><p>Zane\u2019s fingers dug into the dirt, and he jerked in surprise when the underbrush stood up roughly five feet in front of him.</p><p>\u201cGarrett,\u201d Ty muttered as he wiped the leaves and dirt off his face and shook off the rest of his camouflage.</p><p>Zane squeezed his eyes closed for a second before looking at Ty. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is trouble,\u201d Ty told him as he glanced around in the general directions of his brother and father. \u201cThey\u2019re carrying shotguns. Talked about following and killing. And there\u2019s another one somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll we\u2019ve got is your Smith &amp; Wesson and my Glock, unless there are more guns I don\u2019t know about,\u201d Zane said.</p> <p>Ty shook his head and wiped at his cheek again. \u201cThey were talking about treasure,\u201d he said with a wrinkle of his dirty nose.</p><p>Zane peered at him, incredulous. \u201cTreasure?\u201d He pushed himself up to kneel back on his heels. \u201cLike from John\u2019s story?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged and met his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s what they said. But I\u2019m getting really fucking tired of hearing about treasure.\u201d</p><p>Earl and Deuce slowly separating from the foliage drew Zane\u2019s attention. \u201cI don\u2019t like this, Ty,\u201d Zane said quietly, meeting his partner\u2019s eyes. Ty just shook his head helplessly, and Zane curled his hands into fists, unable to hide his aggravation.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Earl asked once he reached their sides. Ty related to them everything he\u2019d seen and heard, down to what each man had been wearing and the brand of boots each wore. \u201cTreasure,\u201d Earl repeated in a flat voice after he was finished. Again, Ty just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDoes it really matter?\u201d Zane asked pointedly. \u201cThere are traps and men willing to kill us. Who cares what they want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matters \u2019cause money is a hell of reason to kill,\u201d Earl answered thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cYou really think there\u2019s some sort of lost treasure up here?\u201d Deuce asked doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t matter what I think,\u201d Earl pointed out. \u201cOnly matters what they think. And if they think they\u2019re gonna get rich up here, then it\u2019s trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to get out of here,\u201d Zane said firmly, \u201cbefore we get in trouble. We can\u2019t do much to stop them if we\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we don\u2019t get dead,\u201d Earl said to him firmly.</p><p>\u201cSwizzlestick did say we were four days\u2019 hike from help,\u201d Ty muttered, still fussing with the dirt on his face. \u201cEither we walked through a time warp, they have no idea where the fuck they are, or they were banking on scaring anyone lost and eavesdropping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI vote time warp,\u201d Deuce said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWould make the retelling more interesting at the water cooler,\u201d Ty agreed in all seriousness.</p><p>Earl was rubbing at the bridge of his nose as he listened. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point, son?\u201d he asked finally.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, they might\u2019ve known I was there,\u201d Ty answered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think they\u2019d have just shot you instead of playing mind games?\u201d Earl countered.</p><p>Ty remained conspicuously quiet, his head down and staring at the ground devotedly. Zane felt his chest tighten as he looked at his partner. He\u2019d never seen Ty back down from an argument when he thought he had a case to make. Anger bloomed again in Zane\u2019s chest and he turned on Earl to speak, but the older man beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cWe need to track them down,\u201d Earl decided. \u201cShut down whatever they got going and deliver them to the rangers to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d Ty asked drolly.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Deuce started uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cI will not have people gettin\u2019 killed in these mountains!\u201d Earl snapped stubbornly. Deuce and Ty both looked at him oddly, obviously surprised by the vehemence. \u201cThose men think they\u2019re safe up here, not being careful,\u201d Earl went on. \u201cAll the noise they was making, they\u2019re not trying to hide sign.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked at him doubtfully but remained silent, refraining from reiterating his opinion from a few moments ago.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re setting more traps like this around, we may be the ones getting killed,\u201d Zane argued.</p><p>\u201cSon, if you want to head on back and bring in the cavalry, you do it,\u201d Earl said with a look at Zane. His voice was calm and cold, and it raised Zane\u2019s hackles. \u201cThat goes for you too,\u201d Earl said as he gestured at Ty and Deuce. \u201cBut the next goddamn word I hear that ain\u2019t helpful is gonna be met with violence, that clear?\u201d</p><p>Deuce didn\u2019t even look up; Ty was watching Earl calmly. Zane stared at Ty, gritting his teeth, waiting on his decision. This was a truly shitty situation, but he would not leave Ty behind. Ty glanced at him and met Zane\u2019s eyes for a moment. Zane had always detected a spark of enjoyment in Ty\u2019s eyes before, even in the most dangerous of situations. That spark was gone now, replaced by something more sedate and sad. Resigned. Ty sighed and looked back at Earl. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to follow them, we need to get going,\u201d he suggested softly. \u201cTrail\u2019s getting cold.\u201d</p><p>Earl continued to fix a glare on Zane for a moment longer before he turned and nodded at Ty. He handed him a clean handkerchief as he passed by him. Ty took it and looked down at it with a mumbled, \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d He used it to wipe at his face as he turned and followed his father back toward the small clearing.</p><p>Zane clasped both hands behind his neck and just watched him go. He\u2019d never seen Ty behave this way, as if someone had just taken all the spirit and fight in him and crushed it to dust. It was acutely painful to see, especially after seeing him so relaxed and carefree just a few hours ago.</p><p>Deuce stopped next to him, and they watched the other two move off. \u201cHe\u2019s not usually like this,\u201d he told Zane in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s not,\u201d Zane agreed, fully aware that Deuce was talking about Earl and that he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Deuce glanced sideways at him. \u201cCan you blame him?\u201d he asked finally.</p><p>Zane sighed, dropping his arms and watching the rigid line of Ty\u2019s shoulders as his partner walked away. How could Earl not see the pain coming off Ty in waves? \u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Deuce shook his head and started through the thick foliage, muttering to himself as he went. After another silent curse, Zane followed.</p><p>WITH Ty on point, following the trail through the dense woods, they were making excellent time. Earl watched Ty\u2019s back as he moved, the set of his shoulders, the somewhat jerky movements. Every time Ty glanced over his shoulder to make certain they were still on his six, Earl felt a pang of guilt. He knew what he\u2019d said had been inexcusable and unnecessary and patently false. Ty was anything but a coward. Now, though, was not the time to apologize. It would keep until the danger had passed, he told himself.</p><p>Zane Garrett was getting on his bad side, though. The boy just didn\u2019t know when to keep his mouth shut. Earl glanced over his own shoulder to look back at the FBI man doubtfully. He wasn\u2019t certain why Ty didn\u2019t just demand Richard find him a new partner. He couldn\u2019t imagine how Zane was an asset to him.</p><p>Ty stopped and held up his fist to halt their progress. Earl slowed and watched as Ty stood with his head lowered, listening. Finally, Ty turned and looked back with a deep frown. Earl followed Ty\u2019s eyes; Ty wasn\u2019t looking at him. Ty was watching his partner. Zane patted Deuce\u2019s shoulder and walked forward, passing Earl without comment and joining Ty at point.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he heard Zane say quietly.</p><p>\u201cThis feels wrong,\u201d Ty responded with a shake of his head. He lowered his head closer to Zane\u2019s as they spoke. \u201cA toddler could follow this trail. Why aren\u2019t they being more careful?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re expecting trained Recon Marines to be tromping around,\u201d Zane said, just a touch of humor in his voice.</p><p>\u201cBut they know someone\u2019s close,\u201d Ty argued. \u201cSomeone who recognized that can for what it was.\u201d</p><p>Earl watched them silently, not intruding in the conversation simply because he was so fascinated to see them actually working together.</p><p>\u201cAnd you said they dismissed it,\u201d Zane reminded Ty.</p><p>Ty looked at Zane for a long, silent moment before he lowered his head and rubbed at his eyes. \u201cIt just feels off,\u201d he murmured as he looked around almost nervously.</p><p>Earl frowned as Deuce came to stand beside him. Ty\u2019s behavior reminded him too much of the times he himself had seen ghosts in the shadows. An explosion like that could easily have triggered a few flashes. Earl knew something about those. He thought Ty would mention having that problem, though. His boy knew how dangerous they could become.</p><p>Zane nodded slowly as he tipped his head to one side, watching his partner. \u201cWe\u2019ll be careful. You know what to do,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Ty looked back at Zane, the frown still set on his face. But as Earl watched them, he could see a hint of calm come over his son. Earl had never seen anyone have that effect on Ty, and it truly surprised him.</p><p>Ty sighed heavily and nodded. \u201cJust... be on your toes,\u201d he requested of Zane before he glanced at Earl and Deuce and nodded at them.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Deuce asked carefully.</p><p>Ty shook his head in answer. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna slow down some,\u201d he told them before giving Zane one last look and then turning around.</p><p>Earl watched Ty for a moment and then turned his chin to observe Zane as the man watched Ty walk off. Then Zane shifted his weight and took four long strides to catch up, and he stopped Ty by saying something quietly enough Earl couldn\u2019t quite make it out. Ty turned and responded just as quietly, reaching out in what appeared to be an unconscious gesture to fix the strap of Zane\u2019s pack before turning around again.</p><p>Deuce moved to follow, his head down as Earl stared after them all. He couldn\u2019t quite figure Ty and Zane out. He wouldn\u2019t call them friends, exactly. They were always mouthing off and antagonizing each other, much like Ty and Deuce did. But when the situation became tense, their relationship changed. The closest thing he could compare it to was him and Mara. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wasn\u2019t sure which hole to peg them in.</p><p>Earl glanced at Zane as the others pulled ahead, narrowing his eyes at the man. Surprisingly, Zane\u2019s eyes flickered up to meet his own and actually hold them; apparently Zane was waiting for him to say something rather than running his mouth again. Earl merely nodded at him, unable to think of anything that needed to be said right then and there. Partners, friends, adversaries... none of the pegs fit anywhere.</p><p>DEUCE paused on the trail, watching Ty and Earl moving ahead of him. It was only a few seconds before Zane caught up with him.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Zane asked. He was looking tired himself. Deuce nodded, though he was leaning heavily on his walking stick. He wiped at the back of his neck with his bandanna as Zane spoke again. \u201cI think next vacation I\u2019m going to the beach.\u201d</p><p>Deuce barked a laugh and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll go in half with you,\u201d he offered as they started moving again, the walking stick taking a lot of the weight off his bad leg as they moved.</p><p>Ahead of them about twenty yards, Ty glanced over his shoulder to check on them. When he saw they\u2019d fallen behind, he stopped and turned around to wait on them. Earl did the same, looking back at them as they approached.</p><p>Just as Deuce got to his dad, a small explosion right behind Ty caused him to pitch forward to the ground. It sent sticks and leaves and dirt skyward, the blast echoing through the woods, and they all ducked and covered their heads.</p><p>When Deuce looked up, Zane was already scrambling toward Ty, who was on his knees, coughing and picking leaves and sticks off his shoulders and out of his hair. Earl was standing, bent over with his hands on his knees and squinting at Ty.</p> <p>\u201cJesus Christ, boy,\u201d Earl said before he was forced to cough again.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t me,\u201d Ty insisted as he shook his head to clear it.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d Zane asked as he crouched next to Ty.</p><p>Ty blinked a few times and looked up at Zane. Then he pointed upward. \u201cSounded like a grenade,\u201d he said breathlessly.</p><p>When Deuce looked up and off to the right, he could indeed see several grenades sitting precariously on the tree limbs above them, attached to what looked like weighted nets. The weights were perched on the thin branches, with the pins of the grenades attached to the trees, situated so that when you brushed one of the trees hard enough to make the upper limbs shake, the weight would drop, taking the grenade with it while the pin would stay in the tree.</p><p>It was a hasty job, even Deuce could see that. Something that had probably just been done minutes before they passed.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Deuce muttered as he peered up at them.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Zane said under his breath. \u201cConcussion?\u201d he asked Ty. Ty shook his head and looked to Earl, but they both seemed to be okay. Luckily, the explosion hadn\u2019t been near enough to them to do them much damage other than to knock Ty off his feet. For once, Deuce was glad he was a slower hiker than they were.</p><p>\u201cMust have been a squirrel or something,\u201d Ty grunted as he let Zane help him to his feet. \u201cWe gotta take cover,\u201d he said, brushing off his jacket.</p><p>They hid themselves quickly as far from the trail as they dared. Deuce flattened himself out behind a rise in the forest floor, Ty lying on his back beside him with his eyes closed. Earl wasn\u2019t far away, hidden amidst a thick patch of small trees. Zane lay on Ty\u2019s other side.</p><p>They were silent as they waited. A good ten minutes went by. And then another grenade dropped. Ty flinched beside Deuce, his eyes still shut and his hands folded calmly over his chest. After a third soon after, Zane spoke up quietly. \u201cThey must know we\u2019re here. No way do they keep those up there all the time.\u201d</p><p>Deuce nodded in agreement. Ty remained still, his eyes closed and his breathing slow and even. Zane growled as another one exploded. \u201cFuck. We can\u2019t stay here. We\u2019re pinned down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Ty said conversationally, \u201cthey know it\u2019s not safe because of the fucking squirrels or evil chipmunks or whatever the fuck they are. So they\u2019re not likely to come engage us,\u201d he wagered without opening his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNot likely?\u201d Deuce repeated.</p> <p>\u201cBut they know where to find us whenever they\u2019re ready,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll know where to find them,\u201d Ty countered as he finally opened his eyes. He didn\u2019t turn his head to look at Zane, though. He didn\u2019t move. \u201cIf we move now, we put ourselves at even more of a disadvantage.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t answer, Deuce noticed; he simply nodded once and shifted slightly where he lay on his belly, face settled against his forearms and hidden. Deuce looked between them, wondering what was next. Since neither man was forthcoming, he had to ask. \u201cSo what are we going to do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI am going to lay here,\u201d Ty answered as he closed his eyes again. \u201cAnd hope one of those things doesn\u2019t fall on me.\u201d</p><p>Zane made a noise that Deuce suspected was a smothered laugh.</p><p>Deuce rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re both insane,\u201d he decided, speaking under his breath.</p><p>Ty began to laugh softly. Zane didn\u2019t even look up from where his face was buried in his arms, but his back and shoulders were shifting in jerky little movements. Deuce glanced sideways at them. Ty was biting his lip, trying not to make noise as he snickered. Deuce looked away, pressing his lips together tightly, not wanting to laugh with them.</p><p>When the next grenade dropped, Ty snorted, unable to stop the laugh that followed. Zane\u2019s hand flashed out and smacked Ty in the ribs. Ty gave a muffled grunt and quieted, but Deuce could feel him shaking beside him.</p><p>\u201cYou kind of wonder what the squirrels think when they\u2019re being blown through the air to the next tree,\u201d Ty posed, trying not to snicker as he spoke. Zane smothered another laugh with his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s all fun and games \u2019til somebody throws a grenade,\u201d Ty recited sorrowfully. Zane snorted and used both hands to cover the sound.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all gonna die,\u201d Deuce decided with a quiet groan.</p><p>After a few more moments of quiet snickering, Zane rolled up on his side and laid one hand on Ty\u2019s chest. \u201cWhat if we threw stones or something and set them off?\u201d Somehow he was serious again. Deuce narrowed his eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Zane, let\u2019s make them all fall at once,\u201d Ty responded, his voice full of sarcasm. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t leave a crater,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to tell me you can\u2019t hit one so it falls without hitting the others?\u201d Zane prodded.</p><p>\u201cNever bring stones to a grenade fight,\u201d Ty advised sagely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty turned his head to look at Zane warily. \u201cI\u2019d have to get closer,\u201d he finally decided with a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s not the aiming; it\u2019s the line of sight in the woods. Trees are too dense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow big a rock do you want?\u201d Zane asked seriously as Deuce\u2019s eyes swung between them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to throw stones at grenades,\u201d Deuce said. \u201cAnd hit them.\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve got better than average aim. Maybe if we set several off, they\u2019d go ahead and come looking earlier, not expecting us to be ready for them.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cOr,\u201d he said emphatically, \u201cwe could just lay here, take a nice little rest as shit explodes a safe distance away and then shoot them as they come over the rise,\u201d he offered with a flick of his finger that mimicked pulling a trigger.</p><p>\u201cYou are definitely having flashbacks,\u201d Deuce told him wryly. Ty nodded, unapologetic as he admitted it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea too,\u201d Zane agreed without commenting further. \u201cThey\u2019d be easy targets, even between the trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two seriously discussing shooting people?\u201d Deuce asked, appalled by the nonchalance.</p><p>Ty turned his head to look at his brother with a frown. \u201cIs that bad?\u201d he asked with complete sincerity.</p><p>Deuce looked at Zane, who had the same expression on his face. \u201cYeah,\u201d Deuce concluded. \u201cIt is, Ty.\u201d Zane shrugged helplessly, though he didn\u2019t look particularly remorseful either.</p><p>Ty sighed heavily and raised his head just enough to look past his feet. \u201cDad,\u201d he hissed. After a moment, he tried again. \u201cHey, Dad!\u201d he said in a harsh whisper.</p><p>There was no answer. Either Earl was too far away to hear them or he was ignoring them because he could hear them.</p><p>Ty sighed again and rolled, shifting his body into Zane\u2019s without comment as he slid around to his belly. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he told them in annoyance before carefully slithering into the thick underbrush.</p><p>Zane swore colorfully under his breath. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he tacked on to the end of it.</p><p>Deuce agreed with a firm nod as he looked over at where his dad and brother probably were. In Deuce\u2019s professional opinion, Ty needed to get off the mountain, and fast. Ty knew it too. No matter how grounded or well-adjusted or well-trained a man was, when things started exploding, anyone who\u2019d been through battle was going to start losing their grip on their sanity.</p><p>\u201cDAD,\u201d Ty tried once he was only a few feet away from where he thought Earl had hidden himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Earl responded in the same low hiss.</p><p>\u201cDo we ambush, or do we go on the offensive?\u201d Ty asked quietly as he pulled himself toward where Earl hid and hunched beside him, their backs to the same tree and their shoulders together.</p><p>Earl was silent for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he finally answered. \u201cToo many unknowns now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to think of them,\u201d Ty said without pity, edging a shoulder in Deuce and Zane\u2019s direction.</p><p>Again, Earl was silent. Ty waited unhappily, holding his breath. He glanced over his shoulder to see Zane staring in their general direction impassively.</p><p>Finally, Earl answered. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cWe go for help.\u201d</p><p>Ty deflated, his eyes closing as he breathed a sigh of relief. Another grenade went off, much closer to Zane and Deuce than the others had been, almost like it had been lobbed at them. Ty jerked his head and saw Zane pulling at Deuce and scrambling for new cover, putting more space between them. Ty frowned and looked back at Earl.</p><p>Earl met his eyes briefly before nodding. \u201cWe go,\u201d he said more definitively.</p><p>Ty started to shift, to get them moving again, but Earl placed a hand on his shoulder and stopped him. \u201cYou were right, Ty,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked at him in shock for a moment before nodding curtly. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d he responded almost soundlessly. It took him a moment to compose himself, and when he finally did, he realized Deuce and Zane were even farther away.</p><p>He was about to give a low whistle to get their attention when three men with shotguns broke through the undergrowth just feet from where Zane and Deuce hunched. Ty jerked to rise to his feet, but Earl\u2019s hand on his shoulder stopped him. They watched together helplessly as the other two men were surrounded.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>THE leader of the three men was middle-aged and average in appearance, a man Zane wouldn\u2019t have looked at twice in passing. He wore glasses, a heavy red jacket, and a plain black ball cap to hide his receding hairline. He stood at the foot of a trail that led down the mountainside away from the camp they\u2019d been led to. Zane took note that the path was well-traveled and marked with two ruts made by a vehicle of some sort. Probably the four-wheeler they\u2019d seen sign of.</p><p>Swizzlestick jabbed Zane in the back with the barrel of the shotgun, forcing him forward. Zane took a stutter-step to keep from falling and kept his hands up in front of him as they were marched into the center of a clearing near the messy little campsite. He glanced at Deuce, who was also edging forward.</p><p>In front of them was a small clearing in the midst of the thick, overgrown forest and what looked like a satellite work site. There was the ATV, sitting off to the side. There were shovels and picks, a few sticks of dynamite, tarps, metal detectors, a single tent, and other equipment Zane didn\u2019t recognize. It did sort of look like they were hunting for buried treasure, though.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d Redjacket demanded of his two lackeys, and he anxiously rubbed at his beard.</p><p>\u201cThey had to be the ones that set off the can,\u201d Swizzlestick offered.</p><p>Redjacket shook his head, walked over, and rifled through Zane\u2019s pockets none too gently. Zane gritted his teeth and suppressed the urge to first, knock him on his ass, and second, lean away\u2014because the asshole smelled terrible. He knew what the man would find in the inside pocket of his jacket. Hopefully he wouldn\u2019t check the back of his waistband underneath the jacket.</p><p>Redjacket pulled out the badge when he found it and flipped it over. \u201cFucking FBI?\u201d he asked in renewed outrage. Zane felt the muzzle of the shotgun dig harder into his back as Swizzlestick tensed with the news.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wanna do?\u201d Earflaps asked as he gestured toward Deuce in distaste.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re Feds. We kill \u2019em and we got all kinds of trouble,\u201d Redjacket muttered, shaking his head indecisively.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just let \u2019em waltz off the mountain, neither,\u201d Swizzlestick argued, his narrow, pointy nose twitching, making him look like a fuzzy shrew.</p><p>Redjacket scowled mightily, and then he advanced on Deuce, grabbing him by the coat and yanking him forward. Deuce had no choice but to grab hold of the man to keep his balance. \u201cWhat\u2019s a gimp like you doing up on this mountain? You\u2019re no FBI man,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Deuce said evenly.</p><p>Zane admired how calm Deuce was in the face of such obvious danger, but when Redjacket went to shake him again, Zane barked, \u201cLeave him alone!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The man pushed Deuce away roughly, causing him to stumble and fall onto the hard-packed dirt. Redjacket turned on Zane and threw a punch that snapped Zane\u2019s jaw to the side and caused him to stagger back into the shotgun. Zane regained his balance and turned on the man with a snarl, only to have Swizzlestick jab the shotgun in his back warningly. Zane glared at them both mutinously, but he kept his hands laced behind his head as the man with the swizzle stick hanging out of the corner of his mouth sidestepped around him and moved to stand next to Redjacket.</p><p>\u201cKeep your damn mouth shut,\u201d Redjacket ordered as he poked Zane in the chest. \u201cYou\u2019re in our mountains now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not here looking for you,\u201d Zane grated out. \u201cWe\u2019re on a fucking vacation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to go to Cabo,\u201d Deuce muttered from his place on the ground.</p><p>Redjacket laughed loudly. \u201cShoulda listened to your boyfriend,\u201d he told Zane as he kicked at Deuce.</p><p>Zane\u2019s body jerked as he resisted the instinct to help. Swizzlestick stepped forward and poked Zane in the chest with the barrel of the shotgun. Zane swore right then and there that he would take that shotgun away from him and beat him with it. After the past week, his temper was seriously frayed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a good goddamn who the hell you are or why you\u2019re here,\u201d Redjacket snarled at them. \u201cYou stumbled onto the wrong damn mountain.\u201d</p><p>Zane could see Deuce\u2019s eyes scanning the equipment around them. There was one folding card table set up nearby that held an array of dull coins, one broken candelabra, and several other unidentifiable pieces. Deuce looked at them with a confused shake of his head. \u201cYou\u2019re actually looking for buried treasure?\u201d he asked with ill-concealed disdain. \u201cAnd blowing shit up all over the place to do it?\u201d he added in growing anger.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t have anybody finding out, now can we? Got to protect our investments,\u201d Earflaps sneered.</p><p>\u201cHow many people have you killed?\u201d Zane asked furiously.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Redjacket growled at him.</p><p>\u201c\u2014over a few pieces of broken\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said shut up!\u201d Redjacket shouted as he raised his hand, prepared to hit Zane again.</p><p>A noisy tumble of pebbles and dirt from the treeline to their right halted him, and Earflaps turned to aim his shotgun at the noise as Redjacket pulled a gun from the waistband of his jeans. \u201cWho\u2019s out there?\u201d he shouted as he pointed his gun at Zane\u2019s face and squinted into the darkening woods. There was no response as every man in the clearing held his breath. Zane tried to turn his head just enough to peer into the forest, trying to see who or what it had been. He almost hoped it was some wild animal stalking them rather than Ty or Earl being careless. Swizzlestick pumped the action of his shotgun and pointed it at Deuce when the silence stretched further.</p> <p>\u201cShow yourself or both these men die right now,\u201d Redjacket called out.</p><p>Another movement answered the threat, and Earl slid down the small hill of the treeline and into the clearing gracelessly, his hands held up and out over his head as he stumbled out.</p><p>Zane grimaced and exhaled heavily. Fuck. This was both good and bad. Bad because now Deuce and Earl were both here and in the line of fire. But good because Ty was still out there. And these idiots would have no way of knowing.</p><p>Redjacket began cursing as Earl showed himself, and he turned just slightly, his attention wavering from Zane as he ordered Earflaps to go search Earl.</p><p>In the space of a few seconds, Zane calculated his chances: all three men were turning away, Deuce was mostly out of the way, Earflaps had his shotgun in his arm rather than ready as he approached Earl, and Redjacket and Swizzlestick were both in easy grabbing distance. Without even consciously deciding, Zane moved, shoving Redjacket hard in the back to tip him over and then lurching to grapple with Swizzlestick for the shotgun. In the midst of the struggle, Zane was aware of three quick shots coming from the trees to their left; Ty offering covering fire from his hiding spot and giving away his presence. Zane laid Swizzlestick out with a hard hook, but as he turned to face Redjacket, pain exploded in his cheek as his world went bright white and flared out.</p><p>EARL was on his knees, his hands laced behind his neck and his head lowered. He cursed himself for his clumsiness. Twenty years ago, he\u2019d never have made such a misstep. When he\u2019d seen the gun pointed at Deuce\u2019s head, he hadn\u2019t even considered not showing himself. It would be up to Ty now if they were going to get out of this.</p><p>The skinny guy with the swizzle stick was complaining loudly about his jaw as Earflaps rolled Zane over roughly. Earl watched as Earflaps rifled through Zane\u2019s pockets, looking for any sign that Zane might be conscious. The man was out, though, limp and unresponsive. He saw Earflaps pull out Zane\u2019s gun, and after a little more searching, he yanked sharp-looking knives from sheaths that were strapped to Zane\u2019s forearms. He watched Earflaps examine the knives before tossing them into a nearby sack. All this time, Earl hadn\u2019t even known Zane was wearing the weapons.</p><p>His eyes flicked to the side, to the woods where Ty\u2019s shots had originated. He knew Ty would be long gone, having simply disappeared into the forest after the treasure hunters regained control of the situation. He hadn\u2019t made a sound as he\u2019d gone, Earl had noted with a hint of pride. He hoped the boy was halfway to the nearest ranger station by now, like they should have been to start with. But he knew that Ty wouldn\u2019t leave for help now. He\u2019d stick around and probably get himself killed trying to save them. It was what Earl would have done. If these boys thought they had the upper hand, though, they were sadly mistaken. Ty was in his element up here.</p> <p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Redjacket shouted, the sound echoing through the clearing and off into the woods. \u201cWhere the fuck did they come from?\u201d he shouted. \u201cHow many more\u2019s out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you they was trouble,\u201d Earflaps answered, unperturbed by the yelling.</p><p>\u201cWell, no shit,\u201d Redjacket snapped. He looked around, his eyes landing on Earl. \u201cWhat\u2019s your business up here, old timer?\u201d he asked. Earl stared back at him wordlessly. He didn\u2019t even blink in response. \u201cYou FBI too?\u201d he demanded. Earl just looked at him, betraying no expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the other\u2019n?\u201d Swizzlestick asked as he gnawed nervously on the tiny, thin piece of plastic he had managed to salvage after Zane attacked him. \u201cYou want us to get after him?\u201d</p><p>Redjacket turned away and looked out into the woods without answering.</p><p>\u201cIf he ain\u2019t smart enough to hightail it outta here, the mountain\u2019ll kill him before we could,\u201d Earflaps offered as held his shotgun at his hip. \u201cAin\u2019t none of \u2019em too bright, following us like they did.\u201d</p><p>Redjacket shook his head slowly, his eyes darting back and forth amidst the trees. He turned back to Earl and knelt in front of him. \u201cYou get sent up here or was this just your unlucky day, huh?\u201d he asked Earl quietly. He stared at Earl, waiting for any sort of response, but all he got in return was another blank stare. Earl would be damned if he answered any questions while they held guns at their heads.</p><p>\u201cThat boy out there know the mountain?\u201d Redjacket tried, getting nothing but silence in answer.</p><p>Zane groaned softly and tossed his head as he lay flat in the dirt. Earl\u2019s eyes flickered to check on him, seeing Earflaps shift as he stood over him, the shotgun pointed at the ground beside Zane\u2019s thigh. Zane would be awake very shortly, and God knew what that man would start saying once he was. Boy had a mouth on him to rival Ty\u2019s, just not the brains to put behind it. Earl moved his chin slightly so he could check on Deuce, who was kneeling, wincing in pain as he was forced to put too much pressure on his bad leg.</p><p>Redjacket watched him closely, following his gaze to rest on Deuce. \u201cYou\u2019uns got a bit of family likeness to you,\u201d he murmured, and Earl\u2019s eyes darted back to glare at him. \u201cThat your boy?\u201d the man asked knowingly with a nod at Deuce. Earl\u2019s jaw tightened, and his lips compressed against the words he wanted to say. Redjacket nodded. He stood and lifted his gun, pointing it in Deuce\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Earl said quickly as his heart stuttered and his stomach plummeted. He closed his eyes and breathed out heavily. Redjacket lowered the gun and looked at him expectantly. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sent here,\u201d Earl answered through clenched teeth. \u201cWe took a wrong turn on the trail, that\u2019s all.\u201d Swizzlestick snorted heavily. Earl didn\u2019t look away from Redjacket. \u201cWe don\u2019t want nobody hurt,\u201d he told him firmly.</p><p>\u201cI bet you don\u2019t.\u201d Earflaps laughed as he nudged at Zane\u2019s hip with his shotgun. Zane shifted in the dirt and groaned again.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Earl continued as if he hadn\u2019t heard the big man speak, \u201cy\u2019all just surrender now, and we\u2019ll see that you get back down the mountain in one piece,\u201d he offered charitably.</p><p>Redjacket looked at him oddly, then huffed a laugh and turned away. \u201cTie \u2019em up, we\u2019ll deal with this shit later,\u201d he ordered no one in particular as he walked away. They went about binding Earl and Deuce quickly, leaving Zane mostly unconscious in the dirt without bothering to restrain him. Earl prayed that would be a mistake as his arms were jerked behind his head and bound tightly.</p><p>Once they were bound, Redjacket stepped up to Earflaps and murmured to him at length. Earl watched them carefully, trying and failing to see a way out of this that didn\u2019t end with someone dead.</p><p>Once they\u2019d formulated their plan, Redjacket kicked Zane\u2019s hip hard.</p><p>TY WINCED as he watched Zane contort in pain. Crouching further into his hiding place, Ty tried to slow his racing heart and think clearly. It had taken more discipline than he\u2019d expected to restrain himself when he\u2019d seen the man in the red jacket pistolwhip his partner and send him crashing to the ground.</p><p>But he had to be careful. He had to focus, despite his heart beating in his throat and his fingers shaking with adrenaline and absolute terror. Three of the people he cared for most in the world were in danger, and there was very little he could do about it that wouldn\u2019t involve bloodshed. The probability that at least one of them was going to get badly hurt was too high for Ty\u2019s liking. There had to be some way to do this without the guns, without violence.</p><p>He just wasn\u2019t seeing it.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t even seeing a way with violence that didn\u2019t end up with at least one of the three prisoners dead or dying by the end of the shootout. He wasn\u2019t even sure that he could get off three accurate shots\u2014and they would have to be kill shots\u2014fast enough to keep one of the treasure hunters from firing off one of those shotguns. It was too much of a risk to take, even if Ty didn\u2019t have serious issues with killing random assholes in the mountains. He\u2019d offered covering fire when he thought Zane might have a chance to fight his way out. Now he regretted not taking the one kill shot he\u2019d had.</p><p>Ty looked around the quiet woods with a hint of desperation. He was alone now, outgunned and out of options. There had to be another way.</p><p>AFTER the second kick, Zane jerked, and his eyes snapped open. Before he could move, though, a shotgun barrel appeared in his line of vision\u2014lined up right between his eyes. He blinked up at it and remained still and silent, his hands limp at his sides. This was unfortunately a more common occurrence in his past experiences than he would have liked. Then the pain came crashing in. His face burned like it was on fire, emanating from the right side but causing his entire head to ache. It was nearly overwhelming, and he had to close his eyes and swallow hard as the nausea welled up and the agony washed through him.</p><p>He distantly heard men talking, and he knew on some level what must have happened. He shifted a little where he lay in the dirt, hissing slightly as his head protested angrily. He tried to carefully shift his jaw, but damn, it hurt. At least it didn\u2019t slide, which meant it wasn\u2019t broken. Thank God for small miracles.</p><p>Redjacket was standing over him, pacing, looking at Earl in annoyance. Zane rolled slightly to his side both to quell the nausea and to check on Earl and Deuce. He relaxed a tiny bit when he saw them both kneeling, looking relatively whole and unharmed even though they were heavily bound with rope and bungee cords.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Redjacket demanded of Earl. Earl narrowed his eyes and looked at Zane. \u201cThe feller out in the woods,\u201d Redjacket snarled. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>Momentary relief washed through Zane when he heard the words. That meant Ty was still free. They still had a chance.</p><p>Earl swallowed hard but remained silent. He looked sideways at Deuce, who was watching him with wide eyes. Earl shook his head and looked back at Redjacket. Earflaps mumbled in annoyance and nudged at Zane\u2019s shoulder with the end of his shotgun. Zane jerked and groaned, rocking more to one side and curling up. If they thought he was hurt enough, they wouldn\u2019t consider him any more of a threat, and they might not tie him up.</p><p>He peered up at Redjacket, whose face was surprisingly composed as he and Earl stared at each other. Zane wondered what was going through his mind. He suspected whatever it was wouldn\u2019t be good for them.</p><p>\u201cOne more time, old timer,\u201d Redjacket threatened Earl.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Earl answered defiantly. \u201cHe ain\u2019t one of ours,\u201d he claimed steadily.</p><p>Earflaps kicked Zane in the hip again. \u201cMaybe this \u2019un\u2019ll talk now that he\u2019s hurtin\u2019.\u201d A choked groan escaped Zane as he rolled away from the man\u2019s foot.</p><p>Redjacket raised an eyebrow at Earl, waiting for him to say more. Earl\u2019s jaw tightened as he nodded at Zane, who was fully sprawled on his side now. \u201cHe\u2019s my oldest son,\u201d he told Redjacket calmly. \u201cThe other man, we came across him on the mountain this morning. Crazy son of a bitch. We don\u2019t know him,\u201d he claimed firmly. Redjacket turned to look down at Zane with narrowed eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane very slowly raised a hand to his face and covered his cheekbone carefully. He glanced up at Earflaps. He was burly and solid, but Zane figured he could take him down if he had to. He was still aware of Redjacket\u2019s eyes on him. If Redjacket figured out that Ty was invested in any of them, he could use them to force him out of the woods. Ty wouldn\u2019t just sit out there and let any of them be shot. Despite Ty\u2019s little game in Hogan\u2019s Alley, he wouldn\u2019t use any of them for cover, not willingly.</p><p>Redjacket looked from Zane to Earl and shook his head, obviously seeing something in one or both of them that didn\u2019t sit right. \u201cDon\u2019t like to be lied to, old man,\u201d he said finally. He nodded at Earflaps and stepped away, holding his gun up and ready.</p><p>Earflaps grinned slowly and stepped closer to Zane, pumping the action of his shotgun and then pressing the barrel to Zane\u2019s forehead. Zane felt himself go cold all over. Cold with fear, sure, because this guy looked like he might just enjoy pulling the trigger. But also cold with anger.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d Zane\u2019s voice was low and level and not at all shaky. \u201cYou won\u2019t like the result.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither will you, hot shot,\u201d Earflaps muttered to him with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cShow yourself, friend!\u201d Redjacket shouted into the woods where Ty had disappeared. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t blow this man\u2019s brains all over the woods!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pull that trigger, and you won\u2019t live to regret it,\u201d Zane told them quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p>He was aware of Earl\u2019s attention focusing on him, and Deuce\u2019s, too, but Zane didn\u2019t care what they thought. If Earflaps shot him, Zane had no doubt Ty would kill him. Ty would kill him, and the others, too, in front of his father and brother. It would be messy. And Ty would regret it later, if only because Earl and Deuce had to watch.</p> <p>\u201cYou got to the count a three!\u201d Redjacket called out to Ty. \u201cYou ain\u2019t a good enough shot to hit all of us before he dies!\u201d</p><p>Zane kept his eyes on Earflaps, willing Ty to make something happen. He wouldn\u2019t take that bet against Ty, not when his family was involved.</p><p>\u201cOne!\u201d Redjacket started as Earflaps began laughing softly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one stupid asshole out there,\u201d Swizzlestick observed in a detached voice. \u201cGonna get his friend killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo!\u201d</p><p>Zane was vaguely aware of Earl trying to reason with them, telling them that if they shot Zane there\u2019d be no reason for the man in the woods to hold his fire, but Zane and the men with the weapons all ignored him. Zane was keeping his attention on Earflaps. Although it wasn\u2019t his personal choice in the way to die, he would stare it down. Ty would be pleased with the method, anyway; it would be quick. He hadn\u2019t liked Zane\u2019s preference to die slow.</p> <p>Redjacket took in a deep breath to shout again, but then Ty stepped into the clearing suddenly, almost ninety degrees from where Redjacket was looking, drawing everyone\u2019s eyes with the movement. Swizzlestick jerked his shotgun around and cocked it at Ty, who stood with his hands above his head obediently. In one hand he held his gun, hanging by the trigger guard off one finger. He dropped the gun as soon as they turned on him and then moved his hand to join the other, which was behind his head already. What he\u2019d been planning to do was anyone\u2019s guess. He obviously hadn\u2019t had enough time or ammo to do anything but surrender.</p><p>Zane shifted back onto his elbows from his side to better see Ty. \u201cQuit yer movin\u2019,\u201d Earflaps snarled to him.</p><p>Ty stood stock still, watching them all impassively. Zane couldn\u2019t decide if he was glad to see him or disappointed that their last chance at escape might have just evaporated. But he knew better. There was no one better to get them out of this than Ty, even if he was unarmed now. And possibly in the midst of a mental breakdown. He didn\u2019t look like himself, nor had he been behaving like the man Zane knew for some time. Even now, he stood staring at them all sedately, no hint of anger or a challenge in his expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re we gonna do now?\u201d Swizzlestick asked as he looked over their four prisoners critically.</p><p>Redjacket looked to Earflaps and nodded at Ty, as if giving him an order to go take care of him.</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes slid from Earflaps back to Redjacket. He didn\u2019t appear too worried about the prospect as the big, burly man walked over and hauled off to punch Ty in the gut.</p><p>Reflexively, Zane sat up in a shot. Seeing Ty being attacked made something inside him clench, something that made him feel possessive and scared and angry as hell all at once. But the shotgun at his chest stopped him from moving further to help.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t even try to defend himself. He kept his arms over his head. His entire body tensed, and Zane heard him breathe out hard as Earflaps grabbed him by the shoulder and rammed his fist into his stomach. Ty merely turned slightly, letting the punch hit him in his oblique muscles, along the side of his torso. He did everything Zane knew he could to lessen the impact of the direct blow to his torso.</p> <p>The dull thud of fist hitting hard muscle seemed loud in the small clearing, but Ty barely reacted other than to wince with the impact. The punch should have leveled him. Earflaps looked at Ty in shock as he shook his hand and backed away a step, and Ty smirked at him.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Ty told him with a grin before whipping his left hand around to smash his fist into the man\u2019s face. He held a rock in that hand, the one no one had thought to check. The crack of bone made Zane wince as his own face throbbed in sympathy. Ty could pack a punch, Zane knew from experience. He didn\u2019t want to think about the damage he could do actually wielding something solid. The moose hat went flying and blood gushed down the man\u2019s face as he fell back and landed in the dirt with a dull thump. Swizzlestick turned, raising his shotgun clumsily as he tried to aim it at Ty, and Zane surged to his feet.</p><p>Ty turned and threw the fist-sized rock at Swizzlestick, hitting him in the head and knocking him and his shotgun on his ass. Then Ty whirled around, intending to go for the gun he\u2019d dropped.</p><p>He came to an abrupt halt when Redjacket calmly stepped up to him with his handgun and aimed it at his head. Something in the man\u2019s eyes must have told Ty he would fire, because Ty slowly put his hands up obediently.</p><p>Zane had almost reached the shotgun when Redjacket shouted forcefully. \u201cStop!\u201d He deliberately pushed the barrel of his .45 under Ty\u2019s chin, forcing Ty\u2019s head back slightly.</p><p>Zane froze in place, fists clenched, a scowl on his face that he knew just highlighted the split lip and the quickly darkening bruises along his cheekbone that weren\u2019t hidden by his week\u2019s worth of beard.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Swizzlestick wheezed from where he sat in the dirt, holding the gash on his head. \u201cShoot the bastard.\u201d Earflaps whimpered in agreement as he rolled on the ground and bled profusely.</p><p>Zane jerked his chin as Redjacket narrowed his eyes at Ty, obviously seriously contemplating doing it. Swizzlestick got to his feet, grabbed his shotgun noisily, and grunted at him in warning. Zane stepped back with his hands up, staring at Redjacket and Ty tensely.</p><p>Ty hadn\u2019t moved. He still stood with his hands in the air and his chin slightly raised, looking Redjacket in the eye as the man held the gun under his chin. He seemed to be holding his breath, waiting. For once, it looked like Ty didn\u2019t have any more tricks up his sleeve. Or rocks. He was just waiting to be shot, and the realization scared Zane more than he\u2019d ever thought it would.</p><p>Finally, Redjacket moved, reaching out to push Ty\u2019s jacket off his shoulders warily. He yanked at Ty\u2019s shirt, ripping the buttons out of it, then pushed the sleeves off his shoulders so the shirt slid back as Ty stood still, watching him blankly. Zane held his breath, waiting for Ty to do something. Anything. But Ty didn\u2019t move as Redjacket patted him down to make sure he had no other hidden weapons or sticks or God knew what else Ty might have picked up out there.</p><p>He tossed away a few more rocks Ty had gathered, pulled a lighter out of his pocket and tossed it away, and removed Ty\u2019s hunting knife. He stopped when he pushed up one of the short sleeves of Ty\u2019s T-shirt. He stared at Ty\u2019s arm for a moment and then looked up at Ty warily. Zane belatedly realized that the man must have caught sight of Ty\u2019s tattoo.</p><p>\u201cMarine, are you?\u201d Redjacket muttered to Ty as he finally backed away from him, far enough that Ty couldn\u2019t reach the weapon as he held it on him. He gestured for Swizzlestick to help Earflaps up. \u201cThink you\u2019re a smart guy, huh, Marine?\u201d he said to Ty. \u201cThink one broke face is gonna save you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade me feel better,\u201d Ty told him with a small smile.</p><p>Redjacket gave him a jerky nod. \u201cOn your knees,\u201d he ordered angrily. He turned his head to look at Zane. \u201cYou too,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Next to Earl and Deuce now, Zane slowly went down in a crouch before dropping to his knees and settling his hands behind his head. Earflaps grabbed up his shotgun and practically shoved it in his face.</p><p>\u201cJust one twitch, fella,\u201d he growled. \u201cGimme one little twitch, and I\u2019ll blow you to kingdom come.\u201d</p><p>Zane wisely chose not to move at all, hiding his emotions from long practice, and from the corner of his eye, he could see Ty in the exact same position. Zane wondered what Earl and Deuce must think of them, seemingly unaffected by such things.</p><p>Redjacket stood in the middle of them all, looking around at them and obviously realizing that it would be hard to keep them all under control. He glanced between Zane and Ty, common sense telling him that they would be the most dangerous.</p><p>\u201cYou watch him,\u201d he told Swizzlestick as he pointed at Zane. He handed the thin man Ty\u2019s gun, which Swizzlestick shoved into his belt. \u201cAnd those two.\u201d He jerked his chin toward Deuce and Earl. Then he pointed at Earflaps. \u201cYou bring the Marine,\u201d he said as he pointed at Ty.</p><p>Earflaps nodded and took Ty by the elbow, yanking him off the ground and pushing him far enough away to hold the gun on him safely. It was disturbing that they seemed to know to keep out of reach with the guns. They had enough common sense and knowledge to make them scary. They stalked off with Ty in tow as Zane went cold.</p><p>As soon as the shotgun was pointed at Ty\u2019s back, Zane lurched. His body coiled as he saw them pushing Ty away from the clearing, but Swizzlestick was right over him and smashed the shotgun\u2019s hilt down onto his right shoulder. Zane crumpled with an odd, choked sound of pain, curling into himself, hugging his arm close as the pain in his head was eclipsed.</p><p>Swizzlestick laughed, obviously happy with seeing Zane curled up on the ground. \u201cAww, now see, I got the easy job,\u201d Swizzlestick said as he moved to stand next to Deuce, holding the gun on them as he positioned himself to where he could see his prisoners and still watch where his buddies were taking Ty.</p><p>Zane felt sick and incredibly helpless as he huddled there under watchful eyes, unable to move as his face and shoulder both screamed at him. When he heard the first blow land somewhere behind him, he turned his face into the soft dirt and closed his eyes. They could beat Ty into a pulp back there, and there was nothing he could do. And he knew Ty wouldn\u2019t fight back because of the danger to his partner, brother, and father.</p><p>It seemed like a lifetime before the hits and grunts stopped behind him, and Zane took a breath to try to settle his stomach. As far as he could tell, Ty hadn\u2019t made a sound. Far too long went by before they dragged Ty back into the clearing and left him on the ground, across the clearing from Zane and the others. Zane tried in vain to see his partner from where he lay, but the gentle curve of the ground blocked his view. To his immense relief, he heard Ty cough and the scuffle of his hands in the dirt as he tried to push himself up.</p><p>\u201cBehave yourself,\u201d Redjacket warned as he walked back in front of them all, rubbing his fist like it was sore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met Iraqi women who hit harder than you,\u201d Ty told him, his voice rough and hoarse. But he had to cough and gasp as he said it. Zane closed his eyes and smiled slightly.</p><p>\u201cWant some more, then, smartass?\u201d Earflaps threatened.</p><p>\u201cGive it a rest. I need to think on what we\u2019re doing next,\u201d Redjacket said crossly.</p><p>\u201cI say we just kill \u2019em,\u201d Swizzlestick offered.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want every cop in the state crawling over this mountain looking for them,\u201d Redjacket responded.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019re you thinkin\u2019? We don\u2019t kill \u2019em; they tell the Feds we\u2019re here. We kill \u2019em; the Feds come here when they don\u2019t check in. What\u2019s the difference? At least if they\u2019re dead, they ain\u2019t talkin\u2019,\u201d Earflaps said as he stood over Deuce with his shotgun.</p><p>Zane cast his eyes around. No matter how much he pushed his eyes to one side, he still couldn\u2019t see Ty without raising his head. He could hear him, though, still breathing heavily from the punches to the gut they\u2019d dealt him, no matter how hard he tried to play them off as if he wasn\u2019t hurt. Deuce was kneeling next to Earl in the dirt; tied up and considered less of a threat; the men were paying them little attention. Zane figured they were underestimating both of them. Earl was no fragile old man, and Deuce would put up a damn good fight if he had to\u2014he was a Grady, after all. And if they were anything like Ty, those ropes wouldn\u2019t stop them when it got right down to it. They all seemed to be built of the same stone as these mountains.</p><p>Zane gave vent to some of his frustration and spat blood from where he\u2019d bitten the inside of his cheek onto the dirt at the hunter\u2019s feet, using the opportunity to push himself up some. He saw Earflaps sniff and re-grip the shotgun in his hands. He still had Ty\u2019s gun in his belt, and Zane eyed it as he lay there.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Redjacket said thoughtfully after a long time of thinking it over. \u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 they should just... disappear-like. Then they can\u2019t tell nobody nothing,\u201d he decided with a jerk of his head to the east. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane swallowed hard. Though it was four on three, these treasure-hunting bastards were armed with both their own shotguns and now Ty\u2019s and Zane\u2019s weapons as well. He and Ty were both hurt, although not incapable of putting up a fight. Zane and the others might have possessed the more experienced and capable fighting force, but they were seriously outgunned. You didn\u2019t bring fists to a gunfight.</p><p>\u201cWe could dump \u2019em down that old well we found yonder,\u201d Swizzlestick suggested as he held his shotgun on his hip.</p><p>\u201cSo now, Mister,\u201d Redjacket said, moving to stand in front of Ty as he spoke. Zane shifted slightly on his side, just enough to finally be able to see Ty where he lay in the dirt. \u201cLet\u2019s talk,\u201d Redjacket said to Ty as he knelt near him. \u201cHow about you just behave yourself while you and hero over there take a little walk with us. No more tricks, and we\u2019ll leave those two alone.\u201d He waved his hand at Earl and Deuce.</p> <p>Ty glared at the man, holding his ribs as he pushed himself up from the dirt and rocked a little. \u201cYou plan to let them go?\u201d he asked finally in a rough voice. \u201cThey\u2019ll wander around lost for a few days, won\u2019t be able to lead anybody back to you.\u201d</p><p>Zane saw Earl frown and could tell he was barely resisting the urge to protest. Instead, he watched Redjacket, the de facto leader of this little trio of assholes.</p><p>Redjacket looked thoughtful as he considered Ty\u2019s request. \u201cCould be, but they\u2019d still know y\u2019all were up here,\u201d he pointed out finally, nodding his head toward Zane. \u201cThey\u2019d still send out search parties for you two,\u201d he said as he waved the badge he\u2019d taken from Ty\u2019s pocket earlier.</p><p>Ty grunted in obvious annoyance. \u201cThen how are you going to leave them alone?\u201d he countered, possibly unable to help himself, considering the stress in his voice. \u201cLots of people know we\u2019re out here already.\u201d</p><p>Redjacket narrowed his eyes, looking at Ty as if he thought there might be some sort of mind-trick going on.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want your prisoners to behave until you kill them, you don\u2019t tell them you\u2019re going to kill them!\u201d Ty informed Redjacket irritably. He was very nearly shouting.</p><p>Zane narrowed his eyes, attempting to evaluate his partner as calmly as possible as his entire body trembled with adrenaline and fear. Ty was still slumped on his knees in the dirt and dried leaves of the little clearing, wincing and holding his side. Zane wondered if he had a broken rib or two or if he was just playing it up to look weaker. Hurt or not, he was definitely losing his grip on his sanity. Or doing a really good job of pretending he was. Ty continued to glare up at the man kneeling near him, his eyes flashing and his jaw clenching angrily.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be killin\u2019 you if we dump you in the well, now will we?\u201d Redjacket argued.</p><p>\u201cHoles don\u2019t kill people. People kill people,\u201d Ty pointed out mockingly.</p><p>Zane actually chuckled under his breath as he pushed himself halfway up. It was such a ridiculous conversation. Most captives didn\u2019t give their captors advice on how to go about doing things or argue with them over how to dispose of bodies, and this Redjacket character was growing more and more wary, beginning to look at Ty as if he might just be insane. Crazy captives were hard to deal with. And Zane quite honestly wondered if the man wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 real hard on killin\u2019 this one anyway,\u201d Earflaps muttered as he kneed Zane in the back, nearly knocking him over again. Zane had to catch himself, palms down in the dirt, and he gave Earflaps an ugly look over his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cAin\u2019t nobody killing anybody yet,\u201d Redjacket declared as he held up his hands to calm them. He pulled off his glasses and rubbed at his eyes. \u201cWe don\u2019t wanna have to drag a body anywhere. Best thing to do is march \u2019em up there, and do it there.\u201d</p><p>Ty slammed both hands onto the ground suddenly, rustling the dried leaves and making an unsatisfactory thud. \u201cI am sick and fucking tired of being threatened by amateurs!\u201d he shouted in utter frustration. He pushed himself up to stand suddenly, turning on Swizzlestick and the shotgun, and he pointed a finger at the cruel-looking man. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna shoot me, shoot me, but I\u2019ll be goddamned if you\u2019re gonna throw me in a hole and leave me!\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s gaze wrenched up from the ground just as Earl and Deuce began begging Ty to calm down.</p><p>No one seemed to know what to do now that Ty was literally telling them to shoot him. Swizzlestick stood in front of Ty, gripping his shotgun uncertainly and glancing at Redjacket for guidance. As Ty threw his hissy fit, Redjacket moved closer to sort it out, his glasses in one hand and his gun in the other. Swizzlestick tossed his plastic stick away with a curse and gripped his shotgun tighter to point it at Ty threateningly, shouting for him to shut up and sit back down.</p><p>They circled around Ty, leaving Earflaps a good fifteen to twenty yards on the other side of the clearing. Alone with Zane.</p><p>Whether Ty did it on purpose was hard to tell, but it was Zane\u2019s opinion that he was just losing his temper and didn\u2019t care if they shot him, rather than purposely trying to divert their attention away from the rest of them. Ty did have a short fuse upon occasion, and Zane figured he had reason today. It was even possible that he was halfway lost in a flashback to his Recon days. If anything was going to cause one, this would. Ty turned to Redjacket as they circled him, both of them pointing their guns at him and shouting for him to get back on his knees. He ignored the orders and continued bitching about their tactics. \u201cYou don\u2019t tell your prisoners you\u2019re gonna kill them!\u201d he shouted at Redjacket in annoyance as he took a step toward him.</p><p>It reminded Zane suddenly of the lessons Ty had been telling the rookie FBI candidates back at Hogan\u2019s Alley. Never overestimate the mental stability of your opponent.</p><p>Swizzlestick stepped forward and jabbed his shotgun into Ty\u2019s belly.</p> <p>Zane\u2019s shoulders twitched, cold fear flooding him. He hoped to hell Ty knew what he was doing. There was no way he or Earl or Deuce could get to him to help when Ty already had a shotgun point blank in his middle.</p><p>Ty took another step, causing the barrel of the gun to dig against his abs and pushing Swizzletsick back a step. The man\u2019s trembling finger tightened slightly on the trigger.</p><p>\u201cYou give them hope!\u201d Ty yelled at the man. \u201cIt keeps them docile and cooperative so they don\u2019t resort to desperate measures when you\u2019re not paying attention!\u201d he said as he grabbed the barrel of the gun, shoved it away from his body, and struck out at the man with a left hook. The gun went off just as Ty let it go, the shot just barely missing Redjacket.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Redjacket yelled, raising his gun. Ty kicked back at him, hitting him square in the chest with his heavy hiking boot and sending him stumbling backwards before rounding on Swizzlestick again.</p><p>Earl and Deuce began to truly struggle with their restraints as all hell broke loose around them. Suddenly everyone was moving.</p><p>Zane was already twisting to slam his arm across the back of Earflaps\u2019 knees before giving him a heavy push, toppling the man over. He landed on his ass with a loud grunt, but he held onto his shotgun. Zane lunged at him, hand out to grab at Ty\u2019s gun, but Earflaps swung the shotgun, catching Zane in the face again, and the pain shattered through him. He was dazed for a moment, long enough for Earflaps to jab him in the kidney with the gun barrel before he shook the haze off and kicked at him. He could hear the cursing and yelling and scuffling going on behind him as Ty dealt with two men at once, but Zane couldn\u2019t get to them yet\u2014he had to deal with this asshole first. Lurching to his feet, Zane grappled with Earflaps and slapped at his belt to dislodge the gun, getting a knee in the gut for his efforts.</p><p>\u201cThat there\u2019s part of the payback,\u201d Earflaps hissed as Zane collapsed to one side with a harsh gasp, trying to get air in.</p><p>Zane blinked hard, the others coming into focus for the seconds it took him to roll out of Earflaps\u2019s reach and get to his feet. Swizzlestick was on his knees, coughing blood and dazed. Ty had Redjacket down, holding him by the neck in a sleeper hold until he lost consciousness. Deuce and Earl were still tied, though Earl seemed to have almost managed to loosen his ropes.</p><p>Zane had to duck as Earflaps took another jab at him with the shotgun, too close to get off an actual shot with it, and he managed to get the man in the gut with a good punch. As Earflaps doubled over with a howl, the gun fell from his belt to the dirt, only to kick away toward the others. Zane stayed on him and kicked out viciously, his boot coming into crunching contact with one of Earflaps\u2019s knees and then his gut; Earflaps gave a series of pitiful howls and collapsed, falling over on top of his shotgun. Zane spun around, trying to find the sidearm.</p><p>Neither Earl nor Deuce were free yet. Ty still held Redjacket by his neck, and as Zane watched he rolled the unconscious man to the side and pushed himself up, reaching for the gun on the ground next to him. But before Ty could get to it, Swizzlestick raised his shotgun and aimed it right at Ty\u2019s back.</p><p>In that split-second, Zane reacted instinctively: he snatched Ty\u2019s gun up from the dirt and pulled the trigger without a single thought.</p><p>Three gunshots cracked loudly in immediate succession, echoing in the forest, and everything came to a sudden stop as Swizzlestick collapsed, thudding hollowly on the ground with three bullets in the chest.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>TY ROLLED to his side as soon as the shooting started, ducking and covering and then rolling into a crouch with Redjacket\u2019s gun, prepared to return fire. He found himself with his gun aimed at Zane, his finger on the trigger and ready to squeeze. Zane was on his knees, having turned his gun on Earflaps, who seemed frozen in place, shotgun loosely in hand, as he stared at Swizzlestick\u2019s bleeding corpse.</p><p>\u201cPut it down or you\u2019re joining him,\u201d Zane said harshly to the stunned man, outstretched arm not wavering as he held his gun on him.</p><p>Ty gasped, his heart racing as he aimed the gun away from Zane. He turned his head to look at the man who lay dead. He was sprawled on his back, bleeding from three different expertly placed bullet holes.</p><p>Zane had killed the guy without even a blink of the eye. Ty had agonized over how to do this without bloodshed, and then Zane had just gone off and shot the guy. While he\u2019d known that Zane was capable of killing, Ty hadn\u2019t seen it. Not like this. Not at all, now that he thought about it.</p><p>The gunshots had caused everything to cease long enough for Earl to finally free himself. He was cutting Deuce loose with a knife he\u2019d grabbed from somewhere. Ty knew he should move to help, but all he could do was stay there on his knees and stare at his partner in stunned silence. He\u2019d known Zane had killed Tim Henninger from reading the reports of what had happened in New York. He\u2019d never asked Zane about it, though, and on some level he hadn\u2019t truly believed Zane really had it in him to take a life so easily.</p><p>Ty shook himself and looked down at the dead man\u2019s body\u2014the man had to have been right behind him, gun up and ready to fire. But Zane had beaten him to it.</p><p>Earflaps was so shocked that he hadn\u2019t moved. Zane got to his feet, walked over, and yanked the shotgun out of his hands. \u201cEveryone okay?\u201d Zane asked in a low growl. He hadn\u2019t even turned an eye toward the man he\u2019d just shot down, and he ignored it as everyone stared at him, dumbstruck. Ty didn\u2019t move any more than it took to lower his gun. Deuce sank back to the ground and shook his head without speaking.</p><p>Earl looked from Zane to the body and back again. \u201cNice shot,\u201d he said finally, still breathing hard.</p><p>Zane\u2019s dark eyes flickered to the body and back before he tucked the shotgun in the crook of his arm and walked over to crouch next to Deuce, murmuring, setting one hand gently on Deuce\u2019s outstretched leg.</p><p>Ty found himself continuing to stare at Zane. Then he realized he was gaping and snapped his mouth closed. He shook his head to dispel the numb feeling, and he forced himself to stand. He spared a glance for Redjacket, who was still unconscious. He\u2019d be out for a few minutes yet.</p><p>Ty looked at Earflaps, and he gestured toward the ground with the barrel of his gun. \u201cFace in the dirt,\u201d he ordered in a hoarse voice. The man complied without argument. Ty turned to his father and was surprised to find him looking at him. Ty swallowed hard. \u201cOkay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGot a rib or two,\u201d his father answered gruffly. \u201cBe fine,\u201d he added as he took the gun in his hand and turned it around to hand it to Ty, grip first.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Garrett\u2019s,\u201d Ty told him quietly with a nod at his partner. He wondered what his father was thinking. The way Earl was looking at him was the same way Ty imagined he must be looking at Zane. Like he\u2019d never seen him before.</p><p>Earl continued to look at him as he turned slightly and offered the gun to Zane. Glancing up from where he was kneeling next to Deuce, Zane took the weapon without comment and shoved it in the back of his waistband. Ty\u2019s gun was still in his left hand, though he\u2019d laid the shotgun down next to Deuce. Ty finally shook off the stupor and moved toward them. \u201cHe okay?\u201d he asked as he laid a hand on Zane\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Zane nodded as he finished gripping different spots up and down Deuce\u2019s leg. \u201cNot broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Deuce muttered, still rubbing at his thigh.</p><p>\u201cMan up, Grady,\u201d Zane said with a half-smile, but his tone was gentle.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d all three Grady men mumbled at him.</p><p>Zane gave a sharp laugh and shook his head. \u201cLet\u2019s get you on your feet and see how you do,\u201d he said to Deuce. Glancing up, Zane flipped the Smith &amp; Wesson smoothly and offered it to Ty.</p><p>Ty met his eyes as he took the gun. He made sure to brush his fingers over Zane\u2019s. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said without looking away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe it was his imagination, but he thought Zane\u2019s eyes softened as he nodded. He shifted to slide one arm around Deuce\u2019s back to help him stand. Deuce hissed under his breath. But he was on his feet, standing unaided.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go find you a new walking stick,\u201d Earl told him as he looked him up and down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna need one,\u201d Deuce acknowledged.</p> <p>Ty was nodding as he looked down at his brother\u2019s bum leg. Not only did he need the stick, the compass embedded in it might have come in handy too. As would the survival rope around its handle. But it was long gone, lost somewhere in the woods.</p><p>They would need supplies in order to get home, and they would have to figure out what to do with their two prisoners. He frowned heavily and looked back at the men who\u2019d tried to kill them. \u201cThey have ATVs,\u201d he remembered suddenly as he glanced back at his father with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>Earl pursed his lips and nodded, looking down at Earflaps. \u201cWhere\u2019s your main camp?\u201d he demanded. The man shook his head stubbornly without raising his face from the dirt.</p><p>Ty walked to stand behind him and put his boot on the back of his neck, shoving his face into the dirt. He pressed the heel of his boot into the back of the man\u2019s neck, grinding it in retaliation for the beating he\u2019d taken. \u201cWe\u2019ll find it ourselves,\u201d he declared as he looked around for what remained of their gear. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna need something to tie them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cut up all the rope and cords they used on us,\u201d Earl told him, a hint of wry humor actually entering his voice now that the danger had mostly passed.</p> <p>Zane stood and walked past Redjacket to a satchel left in the dirt. He picked it up and started digging. \u201cAmmunition, salt peter, slicker, bottled water... here we go,\u201d he said, pulling out a roll of nylon rope, still in store packaging. \u201cAren\u2019t we lucky,\u201d he said drolly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll do,\u201d Ty said as he gestured for it. Zane tossed the rope to him, and Ty began unwrapping it as he pondered the various and sundry ways to tie up the two men.</p><p>Between the four of them, he was pretty certain they could come up with something.</p><p>IT DIDN\u2019T take Ty and Earl long to track the treasure hunters\u2019 trail back to their main camp. They obviously hadn\u2019t been worried about leaving sign; even Zane could follow it. It might as well have been paved with yellow bricks.</p><p>Despite the relatively simple task of herding the two men along the trail, Ty was in an incredibly sour mood. He was snapping answers to questions when they were asked and remaining silent otherwise as he walked behind the two prisoners with a shotgun at their backs. Zane glanced at him every now and then, but he had no plans to mention the behavior. Ty had every right to be in a shitty mood\u2014they all did.</p><p>Zane briefly wondered if he ought to feel worse than he did about putting down Swizzlestick, but the farther he walked along to the soft purr of the ATV Deuce was riding behind them, the more certain he was that it wasn\u2019t worth the effort to work up remorse over something there was no way in hell he\u2019d ever regret.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t get clever with me, Ace,\u201d he heard Ty growl to one of the prisoners. The distinctive sound of the action on the shotgun pumping followed the threat.</p><p>Zane resisted the urge to look over his shoulder again. The biggest problem they\u2019d had as they made their way over the roughly two miles of trail was keeping their two prisoners in line, and that hadn\u2019t really been much of a problem at all. Ty seemed to be taking some perverse joy in it. But Deuce had a bird\u2019s-eye view and hadn\u2019t objected to anything Ty had done yet, so Zane figured he\u2019d let well enough alone.</p><p>Earl stopped ahead of him and turned slightly, gesturing at Zane. Frowning in surprise, Zane jogged ahead several steps to join him.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Earl had his head down, watching the others out of the corner of his eye. \u201cYou think we need someone else watching those boys?\u201d he asked Zane seriously.</p><p>Zane raised a brow, figuring such a delightful question deserved a simple answer. \u201cYou going to tell Ty he needs to give you the shotgun and take point instead?\u201d</p><p>Earl met his eyes briefly. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anymore bloodshed,\u201d he reminded neutrally. \u201cTy ain\u2019t exactly in the best frame of mind right now.\u201d</p><p>Pursing his lips, Zane exhaled slowly and glanced back at his partner, who was watching them as he stood with the shotgun trained on the two tied men. Would Ty really just off and shoot one of their prisoners? Even as rattled as he was? \u201cHe won\u2019t shoot someone who doesn\u2019t attack him head on,\u201d Zane settled on.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, tell that to Mara\u2019s oven when we get home,\u201d Earl muttered under his breath as he looked out ahead of them.</p><p>Zane snorted at the silliness of it.</p><p>Earl nodded and glanced at Zane, turning to look over his shoulder at Ty and the prisoners.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Ty demanded in a sharp voice.</p><p>Earl looked back at Zane with a raised eyebrow. \u201cNo problem,\u201d he assured Ty as he gave Zane one last glance and moved on.</p><p>Zane winced slightly but kept moving with Earl. \u201cIt can\u2019t be much farther. We could all use a break,\u201d he muttered. Hopefully Ty would remember that his father and his partner were beyond the assholes he was herding. Not that he expected Ty to actually shoot....</p><p>The two prisoners obviously weren\u2019t as convinced, and thanks to the shotgun at their backs, Zane\u2019s repeated threatening glares over his shoulder, and some effective knots, the two men moved along relatively quietly. When they finally reached the main camp, the shelter and supplies were a welcome sight, as sparse as they were. Deuce parked the ATV out of the way and clambered down from it, groaning and complaining as he stretched out his bad leg. Ty kept the gun on Redjacket and Earflaps as Earl secured them to a tree with bungee cords and what little rope they had salvaged. Zane dropped his backpack and the satchel he\u2019d carried from the other camp, and Deuce followed suit as he stepped up to Zane and spoke into his ear quietly while they were occupied. \u201cI think he\u2019s having flashbacks,\u201d he confided in Zane with a tilt of his head in Ty\u2019s direction.</p><p>Zane felt a wave of something stronger than concern lap through him. He glanced at Ty furtively. Flashbacks meant military, and that was something Zane just wasn\u2019t equipped to handle. \u201cWe\u2019ll get some things settled, and I\u2019ll see if I can\u2019t talk with him a little, keep him with us,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Deuce winced slightly and met Zane\u2019s eyes hesitantly. \u201cHe was a different person then,\u201d he told Zane in a whisper. \u201cHe\u2019s dangerous like this.\u201d</p><p>As Zane stared at Deuce, he realized just how much of himself Ty truly kept from his family, even Deuce, who seemed so close to him. Ty was dangerous anytime. Anytime at all. Right now he just had a shorter fuse. Zane nodded slowly, not seeing any reason to argue or try to enlighten Ty\u2019s brother just then.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve got plenty to do, see what\u2019s here, get cleaned up.\u201d He lightly touched his own cheek, trying to evaluate it through the pain the pressure caused.</p><p>Deuce\u2019s perceptive eyes studied him, seeming to notice his lack of reaction and storing that information away. He swallowed hard and then gave a jerk of his chin. \u201cWant me to doctor it?\u201d he offered.</p><p>Zane raised a brow. \u201cWhat kind of doctoring you think you can do?\u201d he asked, a touch of humor in his voice. He figured the whole side of his face was one big bruise. There was nothing to be done if anything was fractured. The black eye couldn\u2019t be helped other than to keep the swelling down so it wouldn\u2019t swell shut. His jaw wasn\u2019t broken, and the only thing that really needed attention was his broken nose.</p><p>Deuce just raised one eyebrow. \u201cI did my rounds in the ER just like everyone else,\u201d he reminded as he glanced over at Ty and Earl, who had just finished securing the two prisoners.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Zane said with a shrug after peering at Deuce for a quiet moment. \u201cYou\u2019d probably get the nose straighter than I would.\u201d He turned to look over at Ty and Earl. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>Deuce watched his father and brother for a moment. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with them, I can\u2019t fix,\u201d he finally claimed quietly. He dropped his pack from his shoulders and turned to limp toward a folding card table nearby.</p><p>Zane let out a long breath. After a good look around from where he stood, he went digging in one of the tents and came up with a first aid kit. At least the assholes were well-provisioned. He carried it out to the table where Deuce sat, letting the other man open it and survey the contents as Zane watched Ty and Earl going through the other tents.</p><p>\u201cEarl\u2019s favoring his ribs,\u201d Zane observed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wrap them,\u201d Deuce assured him. \u201cIf he lets me,\u201d he tacked on with a long-suffering sigh. He glanced up as Ty neared them, carrying a radio.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s got a broke rib,\u201d Ty informed them.</p><p>Deuce looked at Zane and smirked, but he nodded in response and looked up at his brother carefully. It was the first time Zane had ever seen a hint of true wariness in Deuce\u2019s eyes when looking at his brother. But Zane was too tired to pussyfoot around his partner, especially when it came to trying to take care of him. \u201cWhat about your ribs?\u201d he asked bluntly. \u201cYou took quite a beating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Ty replied immediately. He looked over Zane\u2019s face critically. \u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d he observed. \u201cIs it broken?\u201d he asked with a frown as he reached out to brush his fingertips across Zane\u2019s bruised cheek.</p><p>Zane shied away from him and hissed at him. \u201cThe nose is. Deuce is gonna set it,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cNot sure about the cheek. Hurts like hell, but it doesn\u2019t feel like anything\u2019s moving around that shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t poke it,\u201d Deuce told Ty sternly as he rummaged through the first aid kit.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to,\u201d Ty told him defensively. He placed the radio on the table and looked at Zane again.</p><p>\u201cNeed some help?\u201d Zane asked, trying to keep his voice calm.</p><p>\u201cI know how to work a radio, Garrett. You worry about your broke face,\u201d Ty advised in annoyance.</p><p>Zane bit back a retort, knowing that Ty would react badly. He almost didn\u2019t care. A good fight would help relieve some of the tension bottled up inside him. Inside both of them. But Zane also knew it would just make the situation worse, so he swallowed hard on the urge to argue.</p><p>Ty moved to sit down heavily next to Deuce and yanked the handheld radio from its cradle. Zane watched him silently as he started messing with the dials, and then he turned to submit himself to Deuce\u2019s tender mercies. As he sat and allowed Deuce to doctor, poke, and prod at his broken nose, he could hear Ty calling out over the radio in a tight voice, repeating the same words and requests for help as he switched frequencies methodically. There was nothing but static in response each time, but he continued on doggedly, waiting a few seconds after each attempt before moving on.</p><p>It was soon obvious that the radio would be as helpful as their cell phones. One of the storms that had passed by must have really done a job on the local towers, just like the ranger had warned them. Zane\u2019s eyes shifted across the camp to where Earl sat going through sacks of supplies, setting out some things, throwing others to the side. Earl stood with his hands on his hips as he surveyed his finds, then began to make his way over to them. He appeared to be favoring the arm on the side of his broken rib, but otherwise he looked okay.</p><p>Ty still sat with his head bowed, his eyes closed as he held his head in one hand and the radio in the other, calling out over the dead air for a response. \u201cNo joy with the radio?\u201d Earl asked as he approached.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Ty answered quietly. He turned a dial and tried yet again.</p><p>Earl nodded solemnly, as if that was what he\u2019d expected. He placed a hand on Ty\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBest give it up then,\u201d he said carefully.</p><p>Ty immediately shoved the radio back into its cradle and sat back in his chair, rubbing at his eyes with the heels of his hands.</p><p>\u201cThis is gonna hurt,\u201d Deuce told Zane suddenly, and before Zane could fully drag his attention away from Ty, Deuce snapped his nose back into place with one quick motion of his hands and laid a small piece of first-aid tape across the bridge to hold it in place.</p><p>Zane inhaled through his mouth sharply and managed to keep his reaction to a twitch. After a still, silent moment, he released a long exhale as he blinked his eyes against the tears that streamed down his cheeks. He winced again as Deuce packed little fluffs of cotton up his nose.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he said faintly when Deuce was done.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Deuce offered as he gave Zane\u2019s shoulder a pat. \u201cAll better,\u201d he added cheerfully. \u201cDad, your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no,\u201d Earl replied without hesitation.</p><p>When the tears finally cleared from Zane\u2019s eyes, he found himself meeting Ty\u2019s as his partner watched him. It wasn\u2019t uncomfortable this time, Earl and Deuce bickering in the background, and Zane thought maybe he saw the emotion Ty was hiding behind the anger. Ty looked as if he wanted to say something to Zane as he sat there, but he looked away with a sigh and cleared his throat instead.</p><p>\u201cWe should start thinking about how we plan to get them out of here,\u201d he said loudly, talking over the other two.</p><p>Deuce looked over at him in surprise. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to take them with us, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a well to throw them down,\u201d Zane threw out crossly, feeling like something with Ty had been interrupted, something he might not be able to see again.</p><p>\u201cWe could dig one,\u201d Ty muttered as he flicked at the wire of the radio, his head still down and his knee bouncing rapidly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey need to go to law enforcement. They\u2019re already murderers,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk, hero!\u201d Redjacket yelled out.</p><p>Ty stood suddenly, the action throwing the flimsy chair he\u2019d been sitting in backward, and he turned toward the two men tied to the tree with the obvious intention of heading over there to break things. Earl grabbed him and wrapped him up in his arms before he could get too far from the table. He lifted Ty off the ground and turned, setting him back down on his feet hard and holding him there as Deuce lunged up and put himself between them and the two prisoners, just in case Ty got loose.</p> <p>Zane didn\u2019t move at first; instead, he stared across the clearing at Redjacket and then Earflaps, who had apparently chosen to exercise his right to remain silent. Once Earl had Ty still again, Zane pushed out of his chair and walked slowly over to the tree where the two men were bound.</p><p>\u201cI wonder now about your chances,\u201d Zane said conversationally as he knelt in front of them to speak to them. \u201cYou know that I won\u2019t hesitate to shoot you. Now you\u2019ve got the Marine ready to skin you. He was Recon, you know, discharged due to mental problems,\u201d he told them in a conspiratorial whisper. Zane looked back over his shoulder at Ty, who was barely staying in the seat with Earl right over him. \u201cThe Doc would rather leave you than risk having you around. That only leaves one in your favor, and he\u2019s not really a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re four days\u2019 hike from anywhere! You leave us here we\u2019ll be dead in two!\u201d Redjacket claimed in outrage.</p><p>\u201cGag them!\u201d Earl called out. Zane had a better idea. He stalked over to the table Earl had stacked with supplies and grabbed a roll of duct tape, pulling off a good-size strip as he approached the tree. The two men struggled, trying to yank their heads away from Zane\u2019s hands, but they had been tied much too tightly to do them any good.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me,\u201d Zane muttered as he taped both their mouths shut, not merely using a single strip over their mouths, but rather wrapping the tape around and around their heads. \u201cI could think of much more uncomfortable ways to shut you up.\u201d He turned his back on them and walked back over to the others, where he tossed the roll of tape on the table next to the first aid kit. \u201cSo. We should start thinking about how we plan to get them out of here?\u201d he said, falsely cheerful.</p> <p>Deuce cleared his throat. \u201cThe ATVs are the only way,\u201d he said after an uncomfortable minute. He didn\u2019t seem to want to comment on Ty\u2019s outburst or on Zane\u2019s nonchalant reaction to it. \u201cWe just tie them down and drive them out of here.\u201d</p><p>Ty sat with his eyes closed, Earl\u2019s hand on his shoulder. Earl\u2019s knuckles were turning white from the pressure he was exerting to keep Ty where he sat. Zane watched for a moment, partly moved because Ty\u2019s violent reaction had been to defend him, partly surprised by the vehemence of it. \u201cTy,\u201d Zane said, trying to get his partner\u2019s attention focused on something besides breaking necks. \u201cTy, we need to know what you want to do. If that\u2019s leaving them here or tossing them in the ravine, those can go into the vote.\u201d</p><p>Ty took in a deep breath and finally looked up, seemingly calm once more. Earl removed his hand slowly and gave Ty\u2019s shoulder a pat before he took a small step away. When Ty answered, his voice was pitched just loud enough for the two prisoners to hear him. \u201cI say we take them with us,\u201d he decided grimly. \u201cWe may need them if we run out of food.\u201d</p><p>A muffled series of protests emitted from the tied prisoners. Zane had to turn his back on them as he covered his mouth to stop from laughing, careful of jarring his nose. Ty wasn\u2019t too far gone if that jackass sense of humor was still showing.</p><p>Deuce merely rolled his eyes and sank back into his chair. \u201cShall we talk about dinner, then?\u201d he asked wryly.</p><p>Chapter 12</p> <p>ZANE pushed through the brush, having escaped from the campsite to smoke after Earl and Deuce called it a night. He stopped maybe twenty-five, thirty yards back down the yellow-brick road and off the path a little ways, shook the cigarette out of the package, and lit up before leaning his head sideways against one of the trees he\u2019d taken shelter under. He looked out into the dark, trying not to think, trying to shrug off the tension.</p><p>God, he was twitchy. After dealing with a long hike up into strange territory, the treasure hunters and their booby traps, Earl\u2019s repeated verbal jabs at Ty, the capture and showdown, and then the stressful walk to the camp, Zane\u2019s strongest instinctive response\u2014besides wanting to curl up in a ball and protect his head\u2014was to try to calm and comfort his partner. Ty would let himself be coddled when he was hurting when others couldn\u2019t see. But Zane doubted anything he could do at this point would help, if Ty would even let him try. It was frustrating.</p><p>Zane knew one thing: that sure as hell wouldn\u2019t happen with Earl around. Zane had never seen Ty react to anyone like he did to Earl. Zane had never even imagined Ty had it in him to behave the way he did around his father: sedate and quiet and eager merely to follow orders.</p><p>It was obvious that Earl Grady had been hard on his sons growing up, but it had been clear from the start that Ty and Deuce loved and respected him a great deal. They boys seemed to be more a product of tough love rather than abuse. And the Gradys hadn\u2019t struck Zane as a family that bickered and sniped to hurt each other until Earl had called Ty a coward.</p><p>The anger still flamed through Zane at the mere thought. The sheer audacity it took to even think that was stunning. And the fact that Ty had so obviously taken it to heart just because his father had been the one to say it made Zane want to hit something. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Earl was being cruel because he was reacting in some way to Zane\u2019s presence. Had he picked up on their relationship? Was he taking it out on Ty because he\u2019d realized what they were doing and disapproved? Zane sighed and shook his head. He was pretty sure he was just being paranoid, and he knew he shouldn\u2019t brood over things he couldn\u2019t change. Leaning his head back, Zane blew a long column of smoke up into the air.</p><p>A twig broke somewhere in the darkness as someone moved behind him. Zane tensed and had one hand immediately on his gun as he whirled around.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shoot me,\u201d Ty requested quietly as he materialized out of the darkness. Zane relaxed and huffed at him, taking the cigarette from his lips. \u201cThose things\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Ty said softly as he moved to sit on a fallen log near Zane. He stared out over the dimly moonlit valley below them.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips quirked a little, and he relaxed back against the tree as he looked down at his partner. \u201cI\u2019m still expecting bullets anytime now.\u201d</p> <p>Ty sighed with a hint of the downtrodden to him and nodded in agreement. He looked down at one of his boots and pulled a stick from the tread of it. They stayed quiet for a few minutes, with Zane gazing down at him. \u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d Zane finally murmured.</p><p>Ty merely shrugged and looked off into the distance. There wasn\u2019t really much to stare at, as dark as it was. It was obvious from the line of his shoulders that he was not going to talk about his father or his feelings or much of anything else. He rarely did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to think that we\u2019re better off at work than we are on vacation,\u201d Zane mentioned after a few more quiet minutes.</p><p>Ty was silent for a moment, but then he lowered his head and snorted. He chuckled ruefully, the sound loud in the still, cold night.</p><p>Zane smiled as he finished his cigarette and stubbed it out carefully on an exposed rock before he put it back in the slightly crumpled pack. \u201cNext time we should tell Burns to send us on a case somewhere miserable. Fate would mean we\u2019d be safe there.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded in agreement as his laughter trailed off. He didn\u2019t seem to have much of anything to say, and Zane wondered why he\u2019d sought him out. He stared off into the mountain blackness without moving again. It felt like a moment that deserved a beer or two, even though Zane knew he wouldn\u2019t have been drinking.</p><p>Finally, Ty looked over at Zane and sighed. \u201cGot any more of those cigarettes?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>Zane slowly raised an eyebrow. He got the pack out of his pocket and pulled out a cigarette, sliding it between his lips. After another moment, he had it lit, and after inhaling once, he offered it to Ty.</p><p>Ty shook his head as he reached out and took the cigarette. Instead of stubbing it out and flicking it away like he usually did when he took one of Zane\u2019s cigarettes, he took a long drag of it and handed it back to Zane wordlessly.</p><p>After a few heartbeats, he reached out and took it again, keeping it this time.</p><p>He was silent, unmoving as he sat with his elbows propped on his knees and his head cocked to the side, only occasionally putting the cigarette to his lips.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t know what else there was to do. He\u2019d learned that sometimes the best thing to do with Ty was to wait. Sometimes his partner needed time to work up to what he wanted to say, and sometimes he never said anything at all. So Zane kept quiet and sat down heavily next to him, facing the opposite way so their shoulders brushed as they sat, extending his legs, and lightly prodding the swollen cheekbone under his black eye with one long finger.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it feel?\u201d Ty asked him softly after several minutes of sitting in silence.</p><p>\u201cHurts like hell,\u201d Zane admitted. The aching throb in the whole side of his face was his pulse. He\u2019d be really colorful for the next several days.</p><p>Ty looked over at him with a sympathetic frown. He was the only one who had remained uninjured through the whole ordeal; even after the can bomb, the grenades, the beating he\u2019d taken, and the skirmish, he\u2019d come out with just a bruise or two from the punches he\u2019d taken. He didn\u2019t even have a scratch on him. Zane wondered if Ty was adding a bit of survivor\u2019s guilt to all his other current problems. He watched him worriedly. Ty didn\u2019t deserve this.</p><p>Ty lowered his head again and blew a stream of smoke down toward his feet. \u201cYou sure it\u2019s not broken?\u201d he asked mildly.</p><p>Zane shut his eyes and made himself unclench his jaw, because that just made it hurt even more. \u201cNo,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Ty turned his head to look at him, examining him in the darkness. It was hard to make out his features, so he probably wasn\u2019t seeing many of Zane\u2019s, either. After a moment, he nodded and looked away. \u201cWe\u2019ll get it checked out when we get back,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Zane nodded. He knew better than to think that was the last he\u2019d hear about it, but for now, he sighed. \u201cIt\u2019ll help when I can get some sleep,\u201d he said quietly. It was getting ridiculous how much he was saying and thinking that lately.</p><p>Ty glanced at him as he blew smoke to the side. \u201cStill with the nightmares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stopped seeing the shrink?\u201d Ty asked carefully.</p><p>Zane\u2019s nose wrinkled as he peered out into the darkness. \u201cI had a disagreement with the Bureau therapist in Miami.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent, mulling it over. \u201cLike a... personal disagreement?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you could call it that,\u201d Zane said as he sank his cold hands into his jacket pockets. \u201cI thought therapy was supposed to help you recover. It wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked down at his feet and back at Zane doubtfully. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you talk to me about any of this?\u201d he asked in confusion. \u201cI was getting so pissed at you,\u201d he admitted as he looked away again.</p><p>Zane winced. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I knew I\u2019d be changing therapists anyway since I was moving to DC, and I guess I figured you\u2019d tell me to suck it up. I was really hoping I\u2019d just get over it, but....\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane, seeming as if he wanted to say something. He hesitated, starting and stopping several times before he finally took a deep breath and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been a better partner to you, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked at him in surprise. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d This was an odd mirror of the conversation he\u2019d had with Deuce a few nights ago.</p><p>Ty exhaled another long stream of smoke and shook his head again. \u201cI backed away when I knew you needed help,\u201d he answered in a low murmur. \u201cI should have stuck with you, whether you wanted me to or not. You\u2019re not a quitter, good or bad,\u201d he said wryly as he handed Zane the half-smoked cigarette as evidence.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d Zane drew out. He had no idea what to say to that, but he was relieved to finally get an answer to why Ty had been drifting away from him in DC. Ty simply nodded and looked down at his feet again. Zane huffed quietly, took a last drag off the cigarette, and ground it out on the rock underfoot. He studied Ty\u2019s profile. \u201cYou\u2019re a great partner,\u201d he added quietly.</p><p>Ty had been looking at his feet diligently, but then he glanced up, a flash of surprise in his expressive eyes. He studied Zane for a moment before nodding. \u201cLikewise,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Some of the tightness Zane had been feeling in his chest since he talked with Deuce relaxed. That wasn\u2019t something Ty would lie to him about just to make him feel better. That was one of the good things about having a partner who was so brutally honest and blunt. When he said something good, Zane knew he meant it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it,\u201d Zane said just as quietly. When he closed his eyes, he saw that shotgun going off and a shot tearing into Ty\u2019s back as he crumpled forward into the dirt. He blinked his eyes open and reminded himself silently that he\u2019d been in time to stop that from happening.</p><p>They sat in silence, feeling the chill settle in the air and listening to the soothing sounds of the mountain. Ty finally lifted his chin slightly and breathed in deeply. \u201cI know how hard it is after you pull that trigger,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIf you need to talk about it....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane very carefully did not turn his chin toward Ty. The very words he\u2019d spoken told Zane several things: Ty was surprised that Zane had shot the man\u2014even though Ty\u2019s life had been at risk\u2014that he thought it had to have been a difficult choice for Zane to make, and that he believed his partner was suffering somehow over taking a life. For a moment, Zane felt a pang of loss for the man he\u2019d been years ago, a man who\u2019d agonized after killing a murderer in the line of duty.</p><p>That man was long gone.</p><p>Zane sighed softly. Ty thought he was a better man than he really was. Zane wanted him to think that for at least a little while longer.</p> <p>Ty glanced over at him, looking at him in a way Zane had never seen. He seemed to be contemplating Zane\u2019s reaction, trying to decide how to categorize it. Then he reached out slowly, taking hold of Zane\u2019s shirt and pulling him until their noses almost touched. He turned his head slightly, almost brushing their lips together. Zane could feel the prickle of Ty\u2019s grown-out whiskers against his lips.</p><p>\u201cNext time you\u2019re struggling, you tell me,\u201d Ty said quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t care what it\u2019s about. That way I don\u2019t have to guess what you need from me.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips pressed together hard, and he swallowed with difficulty, not wanting to pull away from Ty even an inch. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I can\u2019t back you up,\u201d he said, their lips brushing as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhen I think that, you\u2019ll know it,\u201d Ty promised, and he leaned away from him just enough to be able to look him in the eye. \u201cIt\u2019s twice now you\u2019ve saved my life,\u201d he reminded in a gruff voice. \u201cTime you stopped thinking of yourself as the weaker half.\u201d</p><p>Zane spent a moment studying Ty\u2019s face, his eyes so close, their lips so close. \u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>Ty nodded, but he didn\u2019t let go of Zane\u2019s shirt, nor did he move away from him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty damn strong yourself, Ty Grady,\u201d Zane said softly, raising his hand to touch Ty\u2019s scruffy cheek gently. His beard had grown to nearly a full one. It suited him somehow. Zane thought maybe anything would suit Ty. Ty snorted in amusement and released Zane\u2019s shirt. \u201cStrong enough to take care of yourself,\u201d Zane added pointedly.</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes. \u201cYou think I could have taken care of myself after being shot in the back with a twelve gauge?\u201d he posed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I killed him,\u201d Zane said bluntly.</p><p>Ty nodded, still looking into Zane\u2019s eyes unwaveringly. He smoothed down the material of Zane\u2019s shirt that had bunched under his hand and looked away almost regretfully. \u201cThat\u2019s why I said thank you,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t many things left that truly scare me, Ty,\u201d Zane said softly. \u201cBut that\u2019s one of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Ty asked without looking back at him. There was a hint of dread in his voice as he stared devotedly at the ground.</p><p>Zane looked at him longingly, the words on the tip of his tongue: Not being in time. Losing you. But just the sound of Ty\u2019s voice carried a warning; they were too close to a line neither of them wanted to cross.</p><p>\u201cHell freezing over because you actually said thank you,\u201d he tried instead.</p><p>The tension in Ty\u2019s frame ebbed some as he looked at Zane, and he seemed almost relieved to accept the out, as weak as it may have been. \u201cWell,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cQuit being a scaredy-cat,\u201d he advised in an almost gentle voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had lots of practice,\u201d Zane tried to joke as Ty reached out and smoothed down Zane\u2019s shirt again. It was a tender gesture, one Zane wasn\u2019t sure Ty was even aware of performing. Zane felt the knot in his chest relax as Ty touched him. They so rarely shared tender moments like this. When they came along, they were at the same time welcome and disturbing. Zane was never sure whether he wanted more of them or wanted to run from them. Tonight, though, he decidedly wanted more of this one. When Ty was done fussing over the collar of his shirt, Zane lowered his head until their foreheads touched, and he brushed his nose against Ty\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cQuit it,\u201d Ty muttered despite the smile Zane could feel on his lips. He pushed Zane away half-heartedly and stood.</p><p>Zane got to his feet, stepped over the log, and caught Ty\u2019s arm to pull him close again. \u201cNo more nuzzling,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Ty gave a token struggle just like he always did as Zane wrapped him up into a hug. He enjoyed the game they played when it came to control and power and was often disappointed when he succeeded in eluding Zane\u2019s grasp. But it was obvious in the way he let Zane pull him closer now that he\u2019d been missing the contact as much as Zane had while they\u2019d been on the mountain. Zane closed his eyes, the feeling of relief almost palpable as he soaked in Ty\u2019s touch, his scent\u2014even though neither of them had showered in days\u2014and the warmth of his body. He smiled as he slid his arms around Ty\u2019s waist.</p> <p>Ty sighed loudly and rested his chin on Zane\u2019s shoulder as he slid his hands under Zane\u2019s arms and around him. He gave his back a few manly pats. Zane knew Ty was humoring him. But at least he cared enough to be doing it.</p><p>To Zane\u2019s surprise, Ty\u2019s arms tightened around him, the humor of a moment ago turning into a true embrace. Ty turned his face into Zane\u2019s neck and hugged him close, his fingers pulling at the fabric of Zane\u2019s coat as he did so. Zane smiled in the dark as some little knot of tension inside him unfurled and began to flutter like butterflies instead. \u201cI\u2019ll be glad when we get home,\u201d he murmured, his lips against Ty\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty muttered as he extricated himself and gave Zane\u2019s unhurt cheek a pat. A hard one.</p><p>Zane grinned but kept his mouth shut. He reached to grasp Ty\u2019s chin, turned his head, and claimed a short, solid kiss before letting him go.</p><p>Ty swatted at him as soon as he was free. \u201cJust... don\u2019t get carried away,\u201d he reminded with a small smirk as he pointed in the direction of their camp.</p><p>Zane nodded as he tried to calculate just how many hours it would take them to get back to civilization and get naked somewhere nice and private. He\u2019d even settle for semi-private at this point. Ty nodded as if he was thinking the same thing, but then he glanced off into the dark woods, squinting as if trying to find the campfire. They were far enough away that they couldn\u2019t see the glow of the flames, nor could they hear anything from the other men through the dense woods.</p><p>\u201cActually, fuck it,\u201d Ty decided as he reached out to Zane and pulled him close again to kiss him.</p><p>Zane\u2019s pulse picked up immediately, just like it always did when Ty kissed him passionately. He wrapped his arms around Ty and pulled him closer, equally comforted and aroused by having him so close.</p><p>Ty gave a low groan as they pressed against each other. \u201cBeen missing this,\u201d he said in a harsh whisper.</p><p>Zane squeezed his eyes shut and nodded before covering Ty\u2019s mouth again, his tongue pushing in to taste him, both hands dropping to grip Ty\u2019s ass and lift him until he stood on the tips of his toes, his arms wrapped around Zane\u2019s neck to meet his height and kiss him possessively. Zane was addicted to Ty\u2019s kisses. They were much like Ty himself: unbridled and spontaneous, warm and gentle at times, but with just enough bite to set them on fire.</p><p>One kiss from Ty never failed to make Zane want more.</p><p>Shifting his weight, Zane moved to press his groin against Ty. Despite being exhausted, dehydrated, and hurting, he was hard already. He wanted Ty to touch him so badly he was shaking. Ty\u2019s hands slid down his body, finding Zane\u2019s skin under all the layers. It seemed he wanted to take this further just as desperately as Zane.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you wanna start this way the hell out here?\u201d Ty asked roughly, though. And he had a point. He was thinking about the logistics of it all: the hard ground was littered with sticks and dried leaves and God knew what else; the cold air would assault their bare skin as soon as clothing was removed; and it wasn\u2019t just Deuce or Earl who could interrupt them with their pants down. There were any number of other obstacles they were sure to find as soon as they went too far to turn back without parts turning blue.</p><p>Zane groaned as he ran through them in his mind. He didn\u2019t care about any of them. \u201cNeed it,\u201d he managed to say as he moved his lips along Ty\u2019s neck. \u201cNeed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you come out here with a condom, Zane?\u201d Ty asked in amusement as he continued to kiss Zane slowly, almost as if he was humoring him again.</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Ty, just touch me... please,\u201d Zane gasped out between the kisses. \u201cThat\u2019s all it\u2019s gonna take.\u201d</p><p>Ty took a small step back and searched Zane\u2019s face in the darkness. They could just make out each other\u2019s features in the moonlight. He rubbed his hands together vigorously, then cupped them and blew onto his palms. He smiled crookedly as he unbuttoned Zane\u2019s jeans and pushed them down. He reached through the opening of Zane\u2019s boxers and slid his fingers along the length of Zane\u2019s erection. His fingers were still cold, though, and even though it was such a relief to be touched intimately again, Zane was almost afraid it was too cold for the results they wanted. Then Ty kissed him one last time and dropped to his knees without warning.</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath hissed out in a rush, heat zipping through his body at the sudden sight of Ty on his knees in front of him. One of his hands delved into Ty\u2019s hair as he looked down at him with widened eyes. Ty had never even hinted at this before. It was something Zane had simply considered off-limits. But Ty didn\u2019t waste any time now; he took Zane into his mouth, pushing his head forward to drive Zane\u2019s cock deep into the warmth.</p><p>Zane choked on a cry, and he bit his lip to muffle the sounds threatening to tear from him. If they didn\u2019t fuck soon somewhere where he could yell as loud as he wanted, Zane thought he might have to resort to more violence. Both hands gripped Ty\u2019s short hair, and he couldn\u2019t help but move, thrusting into Ty\u2019s gloriously hot mouth. Rather than fighting against it, Ty hummed and pulled at his hip to encourage him to do it again.</p><p>Holy shit, he was going to lose it before he even had a chance to enjoy this!</p><p>Zane inhaled harshly through his nose as he tried to be careful with the movement of his hips. He wanted to give Ty control over the actions rather than merely fucking his mouth, using him to get off, and probably either drowning or choking him in the process. But Ty used his free hand to pull at Zane\u2019s hip again, urging him to thrust. He really wanted Zane to use him like that.</p><p>It was all far too much for Zane to process. The danger and stress they faced, the emotional tangles he and Ty fought, the need and desire, and now Ty going down on him for the first time in the middle of the goddamned woods was just driving every lucid thought out of his mind.</p><p>Zane lost track of everything but needing to move and remembering to breathe. His hips jutted forward, harder this time, and one of his hands scrabbled to grasp at Ty\u2019s shoulder. He felt Ty\u2019s cold hand on the back of his thigh, sliding up under his boxers, fingers digging into the skin as he did his best to take Zane\u2019s cock all the way in with every thrust. Zane couldn\u2019t see his cockhead disappearing between Ty\u2019s lips, and he cursed the canopy of trees that hid the moon from them. He could imagine what those sinfully full lips would look like as the head of his cock passed between them, though.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Zane groaned as he rocked his hips forward. \u201cTy\u2014I\u2019m gonna\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ty jerked his head back quickly and stood before Zane could finish the warning. He grabbed Zane hard around the back of his neck with one hand and kissed him roughly as he stroked him with the other.</p><p>It didn\u2019t even take two squeezes to finish him, and Zane shuddered as he pulled Ty against him, remembering the imagined sight of his cock between Ty\u2019s lips, thinking about how badly he wanted to come down Ty\u2019s throat. His shoulders bowed as he panted and came hard.</p><p>Ty gripped him tightly, holding him on his feet as Zane\u2019s knees went weak. He slowed his strokes to leisurely pulls, eventually stopping altogether as he continued to kiss Zane languidly. Floating along, Zane abandoned himself to Ty\u2019s hands for a long moment, soaking in the afterglow. \u201cTy,\u201d he breathed as they kissed.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t respond, not willing to end the kisses by talking just yet. Zane started moving his hands gently over Ty\u2019s body. He felt Ty smile against his lips as he tugged at the button to Ty\u2019s jeans.</p><p>Ty\u2019s hand stilled his fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t expect tit for tat, Zane,\u201d he assured Zane in a whisper. \u201cDon\u2019t have to do anything but find your sleeping bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd pull up my pants,\u201d Zane muttered as he shivered and did so, buttoning them back up. But then his hands were right back on Ty, and they didn\u2019t stop moving. One even delved into the back of Ty\u2019s jeans, cupping his ass possessively.</p><p>Ty snorted softly, shifting closer to Zane again and pressing their bodies close. He rested his forehead against Zane\u2019s and nuzzled their noses together before kissing him again.</p><p>Zane mumbled and shifted one hand around to cup the front of Ty\u2019s jeans, rubbing slowly. Ty sighed, his warm breath brushing against Zane\u2019s cold cheek. Zane kept it slow, listening to the soft sounds of pleasure from Ty\u2019s lips as he started to unbutton his jeans despite what Ty had said.</p><p>Ty reached down and caught his wrist; the fingers that grabbed him were cold and sticky. \u201cDon\u2019t have to, Garrett,\u201d he whispered again.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips covered his practically before the last word was out of his mouth, and he started pushing down the heavy denim. Zane had gotten a hell of a lot of blowjobs over the years, but he\u2019d avoided ever giving one. Ty knew that much about him. What Ty didn\u2019t know was that Zane was willing to try it for him. But out in the cold, dark woods was not the time to experiment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty moaned as he kissed Zane again, clearly willing to let him do anything he wanted. Zane just laughed again as he curled his fingers around Ty to pull his cock free of his boxer briefs.</p><p>Ty hissed slightly and laughed breathlessly. \u201cJesus, it\u2019s cold,\u201d he joked as he pushed his hips against Zane\u2019s hand. \u201cMake it fast, and we\u2019ll go find that fire,\u201d he said in a lower voice before kissing Zane with renewed passion.</p><p>With a grunt of agreement, Zane began jacking him slowly as he lifted his other hand to Ty\u2019s mouth and pushed two fingers between those full lips. He could make out Ty\u2019s mouth now, see his fingers sliding inside, Ty\u2019s cheeks hollowing as he sucked them in. Zane\u2019s spent cock twitched at the mere sight of it. Christ, he\u2019d have to talk Ty into doing that again somewhere with better lighting.</p> <p>Ty smiled around his fingers and bit them gently before flicking his tongue across the tips and sucking on them slowly. He kept his eyes open, looking at Zane intently in the darkness. Zane moved his fingers over Ty\u2019s tongue, rubbing around it before pulling free. Stealing another kiss, Zane shifted so he could reach around and slide his hand over Ty\u2019s ass, fingers seeking sensitive skin.</p><p>Ty managed a muffled curse against his lips. He stood on his toes, giving him just that much more height, and he wrapped one arm around Zane\u2019s neck to keep his feet as he was fondled. Zane wanted to be all over and around him, inside him and feeling his pleasure pulse through him. But he settled for stroking and squeezing Ty\u2019s cock as he flexed his index finger against the clenching hole, sinking slightly in before pulling free and then repeating the motion.</p><p>Ty gave a wanton groan and let his head fall back, practically hanging on Zane.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, baby,\u201d Zane groaned as he kept his hand moving and pushed his finger in to tease Ty some more.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t respond with anything more than a wordless moan and another languid, sensual kiss. He seemed to think if he moved one way or the other, some of the pleasurable stimulation would stop. His cock jumped in Zane\u2019s hand, and his entire body was tense and hard against Zane\u2019s. Zane growled in frustration. When Ty was tight like this, a hard bundle of energy and writhing pleasure, there was nothing better in the world than to shove deep inside him and watch him go off like a firecracker.</p> <p>Zane\u2019s finger started to mimic his tongue, plunging in and out, deeper, as he tried to give Ty enough stimulation to push him over the edge. He twisted his hand over Ty\u2019s cock and slipped the pad of his thumb over the wet cockhead, moaning appreciatively. Ty gritted out Zane\u2019s name as he lowered his head and bumped his forehead against Zane\u2019s chin. His entire body trembled as he pushed his hips into Zane\u2019s hand, and his fingers tightened in Zane\u2019s hair almost painfully as he rutted against him. \u201cFuck!\u201d he growled in frustration. He was obviously close to release, needing just a little more to find it.</p><p>Gripping Ty\u2019s cock hard as his hand shuttled over it, Zane shoved two fingers into him just as he dipped his mouth to Ty\u2019s chin for a quick kiss. Then he dug his teeth in at the crook of his neck and twisted his fingers around, pushing at the walls of muscle. Ty gave a short, sharp cry before managing to quiet himself, and he gasped and panted out several harsh breaths as he came into Zane\u2019s palm. His body arched and tensed until it had to be painful. Zane spread his fingers wide as the muscles pulsed around them, and Ty\u2019s knees went weak. He whimpered pleadingly, just as he almost always did when he came before Zane and Zane was still riding him hard to find his own release. It made Zane\u2019s cock throb pleasantly, and he cursed again for not being able to do anything more than this.</p><p>Zane shushed him as he gentled his grip and pulled his fingers free, petting the curve of Ty\u2019s ass before pulling his jeans mostly up and then curling his arm around Ty\u2019s waist to support him.</p><p>Ty cursed creatively, his lips moving against Zane\u2019s unbruised cheek and the corner of his mouth. Zane just laughed softly and kissed him as he finally let go of Ty\u2019s softening cock.</p><p>Ty gave a full-body shiver as he reached down to finish pulling up his jeans. Zane pulled out one of the individually packaged wet wipes he\u2019d stuck in his back pocket for the next trip to the second tree to the left and worked on cleaning up his fingers and hands. He handed one to Ty as well got a wry smile from his partner.</p><p>\u201cFuck, it\u2019s cold,\u201d Ty breathed with a small laugh as he buttoned his jeans. They could see their breath now in the night.</p> <p>\u201cAt least it\u2019ll explain why we\u2019re flushed,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d Ty muttered as he made sure his shirt buttons were all straight. \u201cDeuce already knows and to hell with Dad. He can\u2019t think much worse of me,\u201d he declared stubbornly as he reached out to fix Zane\u2019s collar.</p><p>Zane stopped still and watched Ty\u2019s eyes as he let Ty fuss. He wanted to say so many things: to call Earl a liar, to tell Ty he was the bravest man he\u2019d ever met. He just didn\u2019t know what Ty would believe in the aftermath of Earl\u2019s words or what he himself had the courage to tell him. It was hard to open your heart to Ty; you never knew if you\u2019d get a sincere response or a joke in return. There were some things Zane wanted to say that just couldn\u2019t be met with a joke, and so he kept them to himself.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about it right now,\u201d he said softly instead.</p><p>Ty looked up from his collar and met his eyes for a few seconds. Zane didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever seen Ty\u2019s eyes more honest than they were in those short moments. They were sad and worried, angry and lost. Haunted. It made Zane wonder just how much of Ty\u2019s carefree attitude was put on all the time, how much baggage he truly carried with him and just never let on about. Zane told himself in that moment to remember this look the next time he wanted to strangle Ty for being an asshole.</p><p>Then the moment passed, and Ty\u2019s hazel eyes were clear again as he looked at him. He nodded his head. \u201cThanks, Zane,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Zane nodded slowly. \u201cAny time.\u201d After a long moment he reached out and let his fingertips trail down Ty\u2019s chest. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go try to sleep while the endorphin rush is keeping the pain somewhat at bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Ty said softly as he lowered his head and looked away.</p> <p>\u201cYou coming?\u201d Zane asked carefully.</p><p>Ty looked back at him, his eyes flickering toward the camp in the distance and back to Zane. He nodded and smiled slightly. \u201cWe have a tent all to ourselves,\u201d he informed Zane.</p><p>\u201cWas that Deuce\u2019s doing?\u201d Zane asked drily.</p><p>\u201cYou complaining?\u201d Ty asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>Zane shook his head. If it were anyone else under any other circumstances, Zane might have held out his hand. But even in his gentlest moods, that wasn\u2019t Ty\u2019s style. Zane slid his hands into his jacket pockets. \u201cC\u2019mon, Grady. I\u2019ll give you the warm spot.\u201d</p><p>Ty draped his arm over Zane\u2019s shoulders as they walked. \u201cI\u2019ve trained you well,\u201d he claimed, sounding very pleased with himself.</p><p>Zane chuckled. \u201cYou do realize the only warm spot in that tent will be under me?\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his head to look at him innocently. \u201cAnd?\u201d he asked with a slight leer.</p><p>Zane bumped their hips together as they walked along. \u201cJust saying,\u201d he murmured, trying to hold down the grin that threatened. He wanted to hold onto this warmth and comfort as long as he could. It was a feeling he\u2019d experienced fleetingly after they\u2019d been reunited in DC, one he\u2019d mostly lost in the last few weeks as Ty had drifted away from him. He\u2019d almost given up hope on recovering it until Ty had invited him up to these godforsaken mountains. Maybe the trip wouldn\u2019t be a complete loss if they lived through it.</p><p>Ty squeezed his shoulders tightly and then released him, letting his hand slide down Zane\u2019s back as they entered the silent camp.</p><p>A long glance showed Redjacket and Earflaps had finally wrangled around enough to rest their heads against the tree\u2014although uncomfortably\u2014and they both appeared to be dozing. Zane had the intense desire to chuck a rock at them and wake them up. He restrained himself, however, and after watching them for several seconds to satisfy himself they were secure, Zane looked to Ty and waved a finger in question toward the tents.</p><p>Ty glanced at him before looking back at their prisoners with a deep frown. He looked around the camp, his eyes reflecting the firelight. To Zane he looked haunted as he gazed around the darkness, perhaps seeing other camps and other prisoners from the past.</p><p>Zane let him be for a few moments, but then he took a half step in Ty\u2019s direction. \u201cHey,\u201d he said softly. \u201cStill with me?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked back at him and cleared his throat. He met Zane\u2019s eyes and nodded jerkily, and he brought his hand up to his mouth to rub at his bearded chin. \u201cLet\u2019s get warm, huh?\u201d he suggested, jerking his head toward the tent they were supposed to share for the night.</p><p>Zane nodded and walked over to the all-weather tent, where he crouched down and unzipped the front with a silent curse. It was difficult for him, seeing Ty like this. Zane didn\u2019t know what to say, didn\u2019t know how to relate to what Ty was going through. He glanced over his shoulder before crawling in over the thick sleeping bag that had been tossed on the taped-seam floor of the tent. His Ty seemed to be back, for now, and Zane wanted to hold onto him for as long as he could.</p><p>Ty remained standing outside the flap of the low tent for a few moments; then he ducked down and crawled in behind Zane. The tent was just high enough for them to be able to sit up. It was made for one person, possibly two who were very friendly, but it was warm inside, out of the wind, and appeared sturdy enough.</p><p>Ty zipped the flap up and secured the nylon covers on the mesh windows, making the interior a very small space with both of them in it. Zane wondered if Ty\u2019s issues with dark, enclosed spaces would rear their ugly heads, but Ty didn\u2019t seem fazed as he fussed with trying to get the sleeping bag unzipped while sitting on it.</p><p>Zane was sitting up, his head brushing the curved top of the tent, but it was easy enough to twist and get out of his jacket. He figured it would be warm enough with the two of them in there. He folded the jacket and dropped it about where his head would fall when he lay down.</p><p>Ty gave up on the zipper and merely sat next to him, his head lowered as he rested his hand on Zane\u2019s knee. He turned his head, looking at Zane out of the corner of his eye. He seemed to be holding his breath. Zane watched him, waiting.</p><p>Finally, Ty exhaled heavily and lifted his chin. \u201cThey started when Dad picked up that can,\u201d he told Zane in a low voice. \u201cThe flashbacks.\u201d Zane watched him closely but didn\u2019t comment. Ty lowered his head again and glanced back furtively at Zane in another nervous gesture. \u201cI\u2019ve only ever done this two or three times,\u201d he said. \u201cNot sure how to handle them.\u201d His voice wavered as he spoke. He cleared his throat and looked away again.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t know what a doctor would technically classify a flashback, but he\u2019d call it pretty close to being awake during a nightmare, himself. Zane knew nightmares. He also knew there was nothing to be said. He didn\u2019t want to hear platitudes after a nightmare; he was sure Ty didn\u2019t need them now. So he waited.</p><p>Ty reached down and fiddled with the zipper of the sleeping bag again, fidgeting like he always did when he didn\u2019t know what else to do with himself. \u201cWant to sleep on it or under it?\u201d he finally asked roughly as he plucked at the edge of the thick sleeping bag.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sleeping on it,\u201d Zane said, reaching out to tug at his arm. \u201cUnder me, remember?\u201d</p><p>Ty moved with him, turning and reaching out to him to kiss him. Zane paused as their lips touched, pressed, and rasped against several days\u2019 worth of whiskers. It was easy to lift one hand and touch Ty\u2019s cheek gently as he let Ty control the kiss. As far as Zane was concerned, Ty could have whatever the hell he wanted right now.</p><p>Ty let his lips linger against Zane\u2019s as he pulled away, and then he pressed his forehead against Zane\u2019s and closed his eyes. \u201cYou mentioned a warm spot?\u201d he whispered as he let his fingers curl through Zane\u2019s hair.</p><p>Zane hummed a positive note. He reached up to unzip Ty\u2019s jacket, and Ty shrugged out of it obediently. He tugged at Zane\u2019s shoulder, pulling him down on the padded sleeping bag. He pulled his jacket over them both, sliding his hand over Zane\u2019s waist and pulling him closer. The fabric of the jacket smelled overwhelmingly like Ty as the collar fell against Zane\u2019s cheek, and taking a long, slow, deep breath in was reassuring in ways Zane didn\u2019t want to examine too closely. Instead, he subtly shifted his body toward Ty.</p><p>\u201cTell me something,\u201d Zane murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d Ty offered in a whisper as he brushed his nose against Zane\u2019s.</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath caught, revealing his surprise over Ty\u2019s reply. The sentiment behind the whispered word made his heart beat wildly for a few breaths before he could calm himself. He very certainly didn\u2019t want to ask his question about the flashbacks now. Not after that tender response. He had no idea what to say.</p><p>He pulled his arm out from between them to slide it under Ty\u2019s neck, urging Ty closer to his side. \u201cI... I\u2019m here. For you. You know that. Right?\u201d And the shaky words whispered against Ty\u2019s cheek just stuttered to a stop.</p><p>Ty was still, the tip of his nose cold against Zane\u2019s cheek as they lay tangled together. \u201cI know,\u201d he assured Zane, the words barely more than breaths against Zane\u2019s lips. \u201cWhat were you really gonna ask?\u201d he added as his fingertips slid under Zane\u2019s shirt, resting against the skin of his lower back.</p><p>Zane huffed and shivered as Ty\u2019s cold fingers hit his warm skin. Ty knew him too well. \u201cWhat are they like? The flashbacks? Are they anything like when you\u2019re half-awake but still having a nightmare?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty swallowed hard and pushed his head back a little, enough that Zane could just make out his eyes. Ty was looking at him in the darkness. \u201cIt\u2019s more like... a feeling,\u201d he tried to explain haltingly. \u201cThe feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you\u2019re falling. Like I\u2019m not sure which way is up.\u201d</p><p>Zane tightened his arms. \u201cI won\u2019t let you fall.\u201d Then he winced apologetically. Very trite. He sighed. Trite but true.</p><p>He could feel Ty holding his breath. Then his partner snorted quietly and bit his lip, trying not to laugh. He tightened his hold on Zane and pressed his nose to Zane\u2019s again. \u201cThanks, Garrett,\u201d he managed to say, though his voice wavered with the threat of laughter.</p> <p>\u201cGo ahead and laugh. It was awful, I know,\u201d Zane admitted grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the thought that counts,\u201d Ty tried. He laughed suddenly and then kissed Zane impulsively, getting a smile out of him.</p><p>Zane was glad to hear the happy sound, short as it was. He relaxed again, enjoying the slight tremors passing from Ty\u2019s body to his own. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t exactly what I thought I\u2019d be doing today,\u201d he murmured after a few moments of merely enjoying the embrace.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Ty responded wryly. He turned his head and began to burrow his face between Zane\u2019s uninjured cheek and the rolled up coat beneath them, using Zane like he usually used his pillow when they were at home. Zane smiled affectionately as he did it. It was like a puppy rooting through a blanket.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so different about today?\u201d Ty asked, his voice muffled.</p> <p>Zane sighed and slowly slid his hand over Ty\u2019s back. \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Ty jerked his head back and looked at Zane in shock, pushing up onto his elbow and dislodging the coat that had been keeping them warm. Even in the darkness, his expression was plain to see. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked in disbelief.</p><p>Zane would have laughed if he didn\u2019t feel so stupid about bringing it up. \u201cMy birthday. October fifteenth.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him for a second before he thumped him hard on the chest, and Zane gasped. \u201cI knew I should have stolen your file!\u201d Ty claimed angrily as he settled back down again, pulling the coat over them both with a yank. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I gonna say? Take me out for dinner, Grady, it\u2019s my birthday,\u201d Zane posed as he rubbed his chest.</p><p>\u201cBetter than not telling me at all,\u201d Ty said with sincere annoyance.</p> <p>Zane snorted and shook his head. \u201cSee how you feel once you\u2019re past forty. It\u2019s not really something I try to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that working out?\u201d Ty asked in a wry drawl.</p><p>\u201cWell, they keep on coming, so I guess I must be doing something right.\u201d Zane slid his hand down to Ty\u2019s waist and pulled him closer again in order to give his ass a good squeeze.</p><p>Ty shook his head, but he didn\u2019t bat Zane\u2019s hand away like he usually did when he was annoyed and Zane tried to grope him. \u201cYou should have told me, Zane,\u201d he scolded as he shifted his shoulders, trying to get comfortable in Zane\u2019s arms. \u201cWould have been the perfect excuse to tell Dick we were going to some nice little tropical island instead of coming up here!\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, all right. Mark your calendar then,\u201d Zane answered with a roll of his eyes. \u201cAnd you can give me an IOU for this year.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled slowly, a hint of mischief entering his tired eyes for the first time in days. \u201cI could do that, yeah,\u201d he agreed slowly, his tone one that suggested he might have a better idea.</p><p>Zane tipped his head to the side as he looked at Ty speculatively. He was never sure whether to be worried or elated when he heard that tone of voice from Ty. \u201cOr?\u201d he prodded.</p><p>\u201cThe best presents are received in your birthday suit, Zane,\u201d Ty advised in answer. \u201cBut we\u2019ll wait \u2019til we get home to break those out,\u201d he decided as he pressed his nose to Zane\u2019s once more, obviously deciding to forgive him for not telling him about his birthday earlier.</p> <p>\u201cSounds like good times,\u201d Zane murmured. He closed his eyes, unable to stop the smile as Ty began to burrow again. He sighed slowly, the warmth of having Ty right up against him actually working to lull him to sleep as his mind worked over the things Ty had told him. He couldn\u2019t imagine the kinds of things Ty had seen, the kinds of things he must have been reliving to evoke that look he\u2019d had in his eyes earlier. He supposed when you got right down to it he didn\u2019t really know much about Ty at all. The few experiences they did have with each other that extended beyond the bedroom weren\u2019t what Zane would call personal. It seemed like there were more bad memories between them than good.</p><p>Zane thought maybe he should work on changing that.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>THEIR plan had been a good one, in theory.</p><p>Earl and Deuce had packed up several bags and lashed them to a couple of ATVs while Ty and Zane got the prisoners situated on the other two. Strapped down like cargo, they wouldn\u2019t be giving anyone any trouble, and Zane had yanked off the duct tape, figuring the engines would cover any badmouthing that might send Ty overboard. The group reviewed the maps Ty found in one of the satchels, and after Earl said he had a general idea of where they were, with the help of a beaten-up old compass, they\u2019d set off a little after dawn with hopes of making it to something resembling civilization before dusk.</p><p>But at high noon, they hit a snag.</p><p>Zane stood several feet away from the raging floodwaters the storms had created, arms crossed, wondering why he was surprised. It wasn\u2019t like anything had really gone right yet on this nice little hike.</p><p>What had probably been a three-foot-deep babbling brook in the narrow ravine was now a rushing river full of debris, including broken tree branches as big around as his bicep. When it surged up toward him, it was probably rising about five to six feet out of the ravine. There was no way the ATVs would be able to ford it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to hate this vacation,\u201d Ty muttered to Zane as they stood and watched the water rage past.</p><p>Zane stifled a groan and rubbed his eyes. \u201cHow about after this we agree not to say the word \u2018vacation\u2019 again, okay? Actually, no, we agree to not even think the word \u2018vacation\u2019 again.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced sideways at him. \u201cWe\u2019ll use code,\u201d he agreed. \u201cCall it time off. Time off from hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell would be more relaxing than this,\u201d Zane muttered as he glared at the water. \u201cAnd I could get a tan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Earl said with a heavy sigh as he came to stand beside them and look out at the water. \u201cATV ain\u2019t gonna cross that. Everybody in shape to hoof it?\u201d he asked as he looked over at them. The sound of the rushing water forced him to shout.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Ty and Deuce both answered at the same time, their voices tired and defeated. Zane shrugged, feeling their pain. It wasn\u2019t like they had a choice.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do with them?\u201d Deuce asked as he turned and gestured at the two prisoners.</p><p>\u201cToss them in, see how deep the water is,\u201d Ty suggested without looking away from the river.</p><p>\u201cYou really think we\u2019re going to be able to wade through that?\u201d Earflaps asked, voice a little thin.</p><p>\u201cI hope you can swim,\u201d Zane called back to them.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t untie them and let them get across,\u201d Ty was saying distractedly. \u201cWe risk them escaping. I say we leave them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let them get loose and go back to what they were doing,\u201d Zane agreed evenly.</p><p>\u201cNeither of you is stable,\u201d Deuce muttered as he turned to watch the water rush by again. He and Ty stood shoulder to shoulder, squabbling quietly.</p><p>Zane turned slightly away from them. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to take one each with us to cross,\u201d he said to Earl.</p><p>Earl nodded grimly. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave \u2019em,\u201d he said to Zane in a low voice. \u201cBut I\u2019d be with Ty on this one otherwise,\u201d he confided. \u201cLet \u2019em rot.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Zane walked over to Ty and Deuce. \u201cGuys,\u201d he said, \u201clet\u2019s get going, huh? Bitching about it won\u2019t make it easier.\u201d Ty nodded and gave Deuce\u2019s cheek a pat before turning to head for the nearest ATV. Zane followed along after him.</p><p>\u201cKinda wish we\u2019d kept some of that rope free,\u201d Ty said to him as soon as Zane came up to him. He looked back at the river, his eyes searching for the easiest place to cross. There wasn\u2019t one.</p><p>\u201cWinch on the ATV?\u201d Zane suggested.</p><p>Ty was already pulling out the blue synthetic rope from the Gorilla winch mounted on the front of the vehicle, wrapping it around his hand and elbow. \u201cIf we move it closer to the water, it might reach,\u201d he agreed. When it hit the end, he looked up and said, \u201c\u2019Bout fifty feet, thereabouts.\u201d He looked across the water. It wasn\u2019t actually a big river. It was just a creek overfull from the downpours and roiling along at too fast a clip to make it safe to cross. \u201cIt might make it,\u201d he wagered again as he looked down at the rope. He sounded nervous, though, as he weighed his chances of making it across.</p><p>\u201cI could take it,\u201d Zane suggested, though he didn\u2019t really expect Ty to let go of that rope.</p><p>Ty looked at him and nodded. \u201cI know you could,\u201d he said seriously.</p><p>The corner of Zane\u2019s mouth curled. That was a compliment. \u201cYou\u2019re probably a stronger swimmer than me,\u201d he allowed as he looked at the current. \u201cYou\u2019ll almost certainly be off your feet in that mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty agreed. He glanced up at Zane and looked back down at the rope as he slid it off his forearm and placed the coil on the ground. He untied his boots, stood back up, and began unbuttoning his jacket. \u201cBut someone\u2019s gotta anchor it on the other side,\u201d he said finally as he stripped off every piece of clothing he could afford to. \u201cMaybe I can pull myself along the bottom rather than trying to swim it,\u201d he hedged.</p><p>\u201cI know me saying I don\u2019t like this won\u2019t make a difference, but I\u2019m saying it anyway,\u201d Zane said as he took each item as Ty handed it over.</p><p>Ty laughed softly. \u201cBelieve me, neither do I.\u201d The water wasn\u2019t the only danger. The logs and other debris it carried were moving at a fast clip, fast enough that a large piece could knock a man unconscious.</p><p>\u201cAre we sure this is the only idea we have?\u201d Earl asked finally.</p><p>\u201cYou want to get home?\u201d Zane answered without even looking over at the older man, his voice a little sharp.</p><p>Earl didn\u2019t reply. There was no arguing that trying to find a different place to cross would be futile and time-consuming, nor was there any question that Ty was the best choice to make the attempt.</p><p>Ty got down to his briefs, folding his discarded clothing neatly before handing it to Zane so it could be packed and kept dry.</p><p>\u201cGet the ATV going, Deuce,\u201d Zane ordered. \u201cWe\u2019ll need the nose right up at the edge of the water.\u201d</p><p>Deuce moved to mount the ATV, shaking his head and muttering about heroes. He nudged the four-wheeler closer to the water as carefully as possible, slipping and sliding in the deep mud.</p><p>As he positioned the ATV, Ty stood barefoot between Zane and Earl, already shivering in the chilly air. He held the end of the blue synthetic rope and clenched his jaw as he looked out at the water. After another long moment of nothing, Zane huffed, although the sound of it was lost under the rushing water. He turned to help Ty secure the blue rope to himself, tying it around his chest where it wouldn\u2019t hinder his swimming strokes. Then he stepped in front of Ty and reached out and cupped Ty\u2019s face with both hands. Ty looked up in surprise as his shoulders snapped back.</p><p>Leaning close to Ty\u2019s ear, Zane whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t make me come after you. You get swept off, I\u2019m eating your share of the pie.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes tracked sideways as he listened, and his lips quirked into a wry smile as he looked away. \u201cUnderstood,\u201d he responded, loud enough that the river didn\u2019t cover it.</p><p>Zane nodded, squeezed Ty\u2019s shoulder, and took a couple steps back before looking out at the deluge. Well, at least it wasn\u2019t dark, he thought grimly.</p><p>Ty was checking the end loop of the rope when Earl took hold of his shoulder. Deuce looked up at them from where he sat on the ATV, holding his breath as he watched them just like Zane was.</p><p>\u201cBe quick about it!\u201d Zane heard Earl shout over the sound of the river. Ty nodded, said something Zane couldn\u2019t hear, and then turned to look over his shoulder, raising his chin at Deuce. Deuce nodded wordlessly at his brother in return.</p><p>Ty turned his head to look at Zane one last time before he glanced back out at the water, rolling his neck as he tried to convince himself that the cold water wasn\u2019t going to hurt like hell when he hit it. When he started wading in, broken branches and other debris almost immediately smacking into him, Zane flinched harder than Ty did and curled one hand into a fist. Ty visibly struggled as he waded in up to his knees, the water yanking at his feet and the larger pieces of debris trying to upend him. Zane and the others watched helplessly. Each one of them would have gladly done the task, but all they could do now was watch and wait as sticks and stones did their best to batter Ty to his knees in those cold waves.</p><p>Ty stood knee-deep in the water, wasting precious seconds before he went hypothermic, trying to decide the best way to continue. Zane knew what he was thinking: did he keep trying to walk it and risk getting broadsided by a log, or did he give up the footing and try to swim it, putting himself at even more risk for being swept away downstream?</p><p>As long as the rope stayed attached to his chest, though, the biggest danger was being dragged under and not being reeled in faster than he could drown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before Zane could ponder the dangers any further, Ty dove headfirst into the water, disappearing under the little whitecaps and the sticks and other debris that floated past.</p><p>\u201cGoddamnit, Ty!\u201d Zane yelled, even though he knew Ty wouldn\u2019t hear him. He turned and kicked the ATV\u2019s tire before running a hand over his head and beginning to pace. He looked back out over the water, every part of him tense. He hadn\u2019t thought it could be worse than watching his partner wade across the river. But not being able to see him at all? That was so much worse.</p><p>He knew they should be doing something\u2014securing the ATV so it wouldn\u2019t slide, packing up their equipment into the ponchos to keep it dry as they crossed, manning the winch in case Ty got washed downstream\u2014but he couldn\u2019t. He had to watch for Ty.</p> <p>The blue coil of rope on the ground in front of the ATV unwound steadily, whether because Ty was actually making progress across the river or because the water was pulling it in was hard to tell. Zane found himself counting the seconds, wondering how long Ty could hold his breath. A few minutes at least, give or take.</p><p>After a full minute had passed, they caught sight of Ty\u2019s hand breaking the water much further downstream. It was the only glimpse of him, though. He didn\u2019t come up for air.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going down instead of across!\u201d Zane said over the river noise.</p><p>\u201cCurrent\u2019s gonna take him that way,\u201d Earl yelled as he worked hard at packing everything he could fit into the packs to be carried across. \u201cHe\u2019ll correct it,\u201d he said with utmost confidence.</p><p>Zane spared a moment to wish Earl would say things like that when Ty could actually hear him. The confidence he had in his son bordered on blind faith sometimes. Zane wondered suddenly if Ty knew it and that was why he took everything his father said in stride. Be quick about it, his father had said. It implied complete confidence that Ty could make it across, didn\u2019t it? But it was also a fairly common psychological device, Zane knew, impressing onto others your belief of what should\u2014and thus would\u2014happen to achieve an end. He glanced at Earl, hoping that confidence was real and seeing their relationship in a slightly different light.</p> <p>All their eyes snapped to the rope when the coil suddenly started rolling out far too quickly for Ty\u2019s progress. Deuce stood up on the seat of the ATV, trying to look downriver and find any telltale signs of his brother.</p><p>Something had to have snagged him for him to be moving that quickly. The rope was swiftly playing out. It would hit its end far too soon for them to do anything but hope Ty wasn\u2019t crushed by whatever had hit him and he could free himself without assistance.</p><p>But they were coming up on three minutes that Ty had been without air.</p><p>Zane wasn\u2019t watching anymore. Something was wrong. He jerked into motion around the ATV, skidded over the rocks and mud to get down to the water\u2019s edge, and went splashing in after the rope. He was up to his knees before Earl got him by the arm, hauling him back toward the bank with surprising strength. As Earl pulled him out of the freezing water, Zane glanced over to see Deuce gripping the winch controls until his knuckles turned white, trying to give Ty as much time as he could before pulling him back. They all knew the more attempts he had to make at crossing, the less likely he was to make it at all.</p><p>Just as Zane was about to get away from Earl and wade back into the river along the rope, Ty\u2019s head broke the surface of the water, much closer than Zane thought he would be. Deuce shouted as soon as he saw him and pointed.</p><p>Ty gasped for air and took a few strong strokes through the water, but he didn\u2019t go anywhere as the current beat him back. He ducked back under the water again, disappearing from view to use the rocks along the river\u2019s bottom to pull himself across.</p> <p>Zane shook Earl off but didn\u2019t go any deeper; he watched where Ty had been, willing him to surface again, looking back and forth between there and the ATV, checking the rope, oblivious to the water splashing up his thighs and soaking his jeans.</p><p>After what seemed an eternity, Zane caught sight of Ty dragging himself out of the frigid water on the far side of the river, and the vise around his chest let loose so he could breathe again. Earl stood there staring at his son for a long moment before turning to get himself out of the cold water. He began taking his soaked shoes and socks off, his eyes on the opposite riverbank the entire time.</p><p>Ty clambered out of the water, struggling over slippery rocks, probably frozen already and unable to feel the fingers he was using to scratch his way to dry land. Once he was clear of the steep riverbank, he turned and waved to them like they hadn\u2019t been watching him like hawks the entire time. The rope on his chest was visibly tugging him, obviously still caught on something large. After he was sure he\u2019d gotten their attention, he yanked at the line a few good times until it came loose, almost sending him falling backward as the tension was released.</p><p>Deuce sat back down with a relieved thud and closed his eyes for a moment, rubbing at his forehead. Earl finally tore his eyes from the riverbank in order to finish rolling their supplies into dry packs.</p><p>\u201cLucky son of a bitch,\u201d one of the two prisoners muttered grudgingly.</p><p>Zane turned to slog back up onto the bank and looked over the four men with him. \u201cDeuce, why don\u2019t you go next? Then there will be two of you over there when we send one of them.\u201d He jerked a thumb at Earflaps and Redjacket.</p><p>\u201cGood plan,\u201d Deuce muttered as he began to strip his clothing just as Ty had done. They stuffed his and Ty\u2019s things into one of the waterproof packs with as many supplies as they could, and Deuce slung it over his shoulders as Earl worked the winch.</p><p>On the other side of the rushing water, Ty had found a tree to secure the heavy nylon line to. When the winch pulled it tight and it held, Zane could see Ty\u2019s shoulders slump in relief. He felt like slumping himself. But not yet. He watched as Ty picked up a handful of leaves from the ground and began rubbing his bare skin down, trying to dry himself before he got too cold. They needed to hurry.</p> <p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d he asked Deuce.</p><p>Deuce sighed as he looked at Zane, but his lips quirked into a wry smile as he nodded. \u201cI just wish I could think of something clever to say,\u201d he admitted as he put his hand on the taut line and began to follow it into the water. \u201cHoly shit, it\u2019s cold!\u201d he called out as the water lapped at his bare ankles, but he kept moving anyway.</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes, put his hands on his hips, and turned on their prisoners. \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d he asked pleasantly. They both sat staring at him as if he was out of his mind. Studying them, Zane thought he might understand why Ty got that look of unholy glee in his eyes sometimes. \u201cRight then. I nominate you.\u201d He pointed at Redjacket. \u201cAll in favor?\u201d He raised his hand.</p><p>Beside him, Earl raised his hand as well without taking his eyes off Deuce. Earflaps quickly raised both hands, since they were lashed together.</p><p>Redjacket snarled at him. \u201cPut your hands down, idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ayes have it.\u201d Zane grabbed Redjacket by the arms and started propelling him toward the water.</p><p>Earl watched them distractedly, his attention torn between them and Deuce as he struggled out of the water on the other side. He breathed a sigh of relief as Ty grabbed Deuce by the forearm and yanked him up the slippery bank to safety. He turned to Zane and stepped close enough to speak to him in a low voice. \u201cDon\u2019t you think we should cross with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo risky for us,\u201d Zane reasoned as he watched Redjacket inch into the water. Earl looked at him in confusion for a moment and then turned to watch Redjacket\u2019s progress. The man had stopped and dug in just short of the water, and Zane shrugged. In one smooth motion, he pulled his gun and fired a shot that hit and skidded through the wet dirt at Redjacket\u2019s feet, sending him scurrying into the water with a yell.</p><p>\u201cYou asshole! You\u2019re gonna kill me!\u201d he bawled. But he grabbed the rope, put it to his back to have support against the strength of the rushing water, and started moving deeper into the current.</p><p>Across the water, Ty and Deuce had stopped getting dressed and were both shouting unintelligibly at them. Zane glanced at Earl to see if he was making out what they were saying.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re asking you not to shoot at them again,\u201d Earl answered, his lips almost twitching into a smile.</p><p>Zane smiled and gestured significantly with the weapon when Redjacket looked back at them obstinately. The longer he tarried, the colder he would get. They hadn\u2019t allowed him to remove his clothing, and Zane didn\u2019t care if he caught ill. He raised his gun again threateningly. Across the water, Ty and Deuce both scrambled to take cover behind large trees in case Zane fired again. Earl actually chuckled as he moved to start collecting any leftover equipment he could gather.</p><p>Redjacket inched into the rushing water, holding tight to the rope with both hands and looking back at Zane with every other step as he waded through the water. He was about halfway across, being barraged by rushing water and all the small debris that came with it, when he stopped and looked back at Zane furtively. This look was different, and Zane tensed. Redjacket squared his shoulders and stood up straight\u2014as straight as he could in the pounding waves\u2014and he deliberately let go of the rope and ducked under it, letting the current take him. He was risking death at the hands of the river in order to attempt an escape.</p><p>\u201cDamn fool,\u201d Earflaps grunted, loud enough that Zane heard.</p><p>Zane glanced downriver, seeing how the water crashed against the rocky sides of the ravine indiscriminately, smashing up branches and anything else in its path. \u201cTy!\u201d he yelled, taking two fast steps down to the water and pointing.</p><p>On the other side, Ty and Deuce were both scrambling down the steep embankment, trying to get ahead of the man and snag him before he was swept away beyond rescue. Earl grabbed at Zane again as the current took Redjacket into the middle of the river and buffeted him against the whitecaps being made by the rocks underneath the surface. \u201cWon\u2019t do to kill yourself over him,\u201d Earl said to Zane breathlessly as he held him back. They began running along the bank instead, trying in vain to find something that would stop his progress.</p><p>It soon became apparent that Redjacket was no longer swimming to get away. He screamed silently at them as he flailed in the rapids. He was caught in an eddy that swirled with broken sticks and debris, all swamping him as he struggled to free himself from the grasp of the whirlpool.</p><p>Ty and Deuce reached the bank where they were nearest him, but they were still too far to reach him and drag him out, and neither man appeared to be willing to swim into the maelstrom the water created just a little further downstream. The only reason Ty hadn\u2019t been swept away was because he\u2019d kept himself close to the bottom, where the water was calmer and there were handholds to pull on. The treasure hunter hadn\u2019t stood a chance trying it like he had.</p><p>Zane closed his eyes, letting the roar of the water fill his ears after he saw a large tree limb crash into Redjacket\u2019s back and the man slipped into the roiling flood, carried limply away.</p><p>After a few moments of nothing but the overwhelming rush of water, the sound of Ty\u2019s voice finally drifted to them. They couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying even though he was shouting at them and waving, pointing toward the rope and the ATV.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Zane said shortly as he opened his eyes and walked back to the ATV where Earflaps was frozen in place, staring at the water.</p><p>\u201cBest we send him next,\u201d Earl told Zane sedately with a nod of his head at their lone remaining prisoner. He still had to shout to be heard.</p><p>Zane walked over to the man, who eyed him warily. \u201cJust hold onto the rope, and you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Zane said in something resembling reassurance. And after a moment\u2019s deliberation of the man\u2019s mental state, Zane drew one of his knives and sliced through the rope and tape binding his wrists.</p><p>Earflaps blinked down at his hands and then at Zane. \u201cThanks. I think,\u201d he mumbled as he removed most of his outer clothing and then shuffled into the water.</p><p>They watched him make his way precariously across the burgeoning water, gripping the nylon line so tight his knuckles were white by the time he was a yard away from them. Zane slowly removed his own clothes, stuffing them into the bag Earl indicated.</p><p>Earl zipped up the last remaining pack and hoisted it. \u201cThat\u2019s all we\u2019re gonna be able to take with us,\u201d he told Zane worriedly. Their clothing and shoes had taken up much of the room in the packs, and only the necessary supplies remained.</p><p>Zane turned his attention to Earl. \u201cHow far off do you think we are?\u201d</p><p>Earl sighed and squinted his eyes, shaking his head as if trying to remember a map. \u201cIf we\u2019re where I think we are, it\u2019s still a good two, three days\u2019 walk before we see a ranger,\u201d he finally decided. \u201cAnd that\u2019s only if we\u2019re where I think we are,\u201d he repeated as he looked up at the sky. They hadn\u2019t been able to see the stars at night for some time due to the cloud cover.</p><p>\u201cSo another couple bags would be a good thing, just in case,\u201d Zane surmised, studying the older man.</p><p>Earl was already shaking his head. \u201cAin\u2019t worth the danger,\u201d he told Zane firmly. He pointed at the wheels of the ATV, which were already sliding dangerously toward the water. \u201cPlus, you and Ty both already been wet for too long,\u201d he added as he pointed at Zane\u2019s soaked jeans. \u201cThis water\u2019s coming from the peaks. Go back across another time and you won\u2019t make it before you\u2019re frozen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get moving then,\u201d Zane said, looking across the water and steeling himself to cross the frigid expanse. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to make do without the rest.\u201d</p><p>THE five of them sat hunched around a fire they\u2019d all cussed over before getting started. After Zane and Earl had waded across the river with everything they could keep dry, they\u2019d all been shaking so badly it had taken attempts from each of them before Ty had managed to get the matches to work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Deuce was thankful they\u2019d been able to keep the blankets and extra clothing. He was pretty sure they would all freeze if they were still wet, because it was getting colder as the sun set. After the trial of crossing the river\u2014and losing the man they\u2019d known only as Redjacket\u2014no one mentioned trying to gear up and get any farther before nightfall. Dinner was slow cooking, mainly because they were all too listless and exhausted to mess with it. But as Deuce warmed a little, the psychiatrist in him began to have a fit.</p><p>So far two men were dead; Zane had shot one and they\u2019d watched one pretty much commit suicide trying to escape justice. Deuce supposed Redjacket could be alive somewhere downstream. In his opinion it was unlikely. So unlikely that they\u2019d elected not to waste time and energy trying to find him. He glanced to Earflaps, sprawled on the ground on the far side of the fire, trussed up and snoring noisily.</p><p>Deuce looked up across the fire at Earl, who sat staring into the flames with a frown set on his face. It didn\u2019t seem the time or the place to address any issues pertaining to his father and Ty, did it? Or was he just terrified of doing it and being in the middle? He shook his head and glanced to the side, where Ty and Zane sat next to one another. Ty was hunched over and rocking slightly, just like he always did when he let his self-control slip a little. And it was probably serving a secondary purpose of keeping him warm.</p> <p>It was alternately fascinating and painful, watching Ty and Zane together. They fought and they argued, sometimes cruelly. But Ty had brought Zane up here, hoping Deuce would help him, and Zane had been willing to leap into that river with nothing but dumb luck as a lifeline just on the off chance that he might be able to help Ty. They were a study in extremes, and as much as they denied it, they seemed well matched. After watching Zane take Ty\u2019s face in his hands and lean forward to speak to him\u2014when it had very much looked like he\u2019d been about to kiss him\u2014Deuce suspected they were better matched than they knew themselves. But that wasn\u2019t really a topic Deuce could bring up now, either, not in front of Earl.</p><p>Deuce squeezed his eyes closed and massaged the bridge of his nose, fighting a headache. \u201cSo, Ty,\u201d he finally decided on, tired of the tense silence. \u201cThat was some distraction ploy you used back in the camp,\u201d he complimented, looking at his brother closely in the flickering light. \u201cHow\u2019d you know they wouldn\u2019t shoot you?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up at him blankly, appearing not to understand. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked in confusion. Zane turned his chin, watching Ty with a small frown.</p><p>\u201cYelling at the assholes with guns,\u201d Deuce provided with a small smile. \u201cPretending you were losing it.\u201d</p><p>Ty pressed his lips together tightly and then looked back down at the tin plate he held. \u201cYeah,\u201d he answered flatly.</p> <p>Deuce continued to look at him. So, mental breakdown and not a clever ploy, then. That was good to know, at any rate. Just as worrisome were the slight changes on Zane\u2019s face when Deuce glanced at him; the frown went flat, Zane\u2019s eyes narrowed, and then he squeezed them shut for a few seconds before reopening them and focusing on Ty again.</p><p>\u201cYou were pretending, right?\u201d Deuce asked Ty.</p><p>Ty looked up and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a dumbass for doin\u2019 the yellin\u2019,\u201d Earl stated, pulling his blanket tighter around his shoulders.</p><p>Deuce looked over at his father as his head began to pound harder. \u201cDad,\u201d he said in frustration. \u201cWould you just shut the hell up for one fucking minute?\u201d</p><p>Earl looked up slowly, looking at Deuce in shock. Ty stared at Deuce with much the same expression Earl was, his mouth slightly agape. Zane snorted and ducked his head as he rubbed at his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re on his case more than usual, or are you just getting meaner in your old age? \u2019Cause you sure as hell ain\u2019t gettin\u2019 smarter,\u201d Deuce snapped.</p><p>\u201cDeacon,\u201d Ty said softly, his voice surprised and full of dread.</p><p>Deuce didn\u2019t look away from his father. He saw Earl\u2019s jaw tighten as he ground his teeth. Neither of his sons had ever spoken to him like that. In fact, Deuce was pretty sure no one had ever spoken to Earl Grady like that and walked away except perhaps for Mara. Earl looked as if he was about to say something, but then he began to nod slowly, and he sighed. He looked from Deuce to Ty slowly. Ty met his eyes, though he did so with clear trepidation, and he shifted nervously where he sat. Deuce thought he might have caught sight of Zane\u2019s hand gently settling on Ty\u2019s leg.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Earl said to Ty in a rough voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, boy,\u201d he offered.</p><p>Ty stared at him in obvious surprise for long, tense moments before he nodded jerkily. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d he responded almost inaudibly.</p><p>Zane leaned closer to Ty and murmured something\u2014he didn\u2019t look at all appeased. When Ty just shook his head, Zane leaned back and kept his mouth shut. But his dark eyes were filled with something menacing that confused Deuce. Not many emotions inspired that kind of darkness: fury, desperation... utter devotion.</p><p>One thing was certain. If Zane ever came to any family holidays with Ty, it would be interesting.</p><p>They ate in silence, all of them too tired and too hungry to argue any more or try to make idle conversation. As soon as Earl had finished, he stood with his bedroll. \u201cNight, boys,\u201d was all he said as he turned and walked a few feet away to settle down for the night.</p> <p>Deuce waited until his father had done so before he scooted closer to Ty and Zane and lowered his voice. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have a plan, did you?\u201d he asked Ty. It came out as more of a statement than a question. Ty glanced at him sideways before looking back down at the tin plate in his hand. He shook his head in answer. Zane looked up as well, but this time there was no emotion to be read on his face.</p><p>Deuce watched them both in growing anger. \u201cDo you two have any idea how completely dysfunctional you are?\u201d he asked them.</p><p>\u201cDysfunctional?\u201d Zane repeated, though his voice was low.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both practically suicidal,\u201d Deuce pointed out, forcing himself to keep his voice low. The last thing they needed was for Earl or Earflaps to weigh in on this. \u201cFirst Ty goes ballistic and starts begging people to shoot him; then you go off and try to dive into that river without even thinking about how you\u2019d get back out.\u201d</p><p>Ty flinched and turned to look at Zane questioningly, but Zane was watching Deuce. Deuce rolled his eyes and looked away. \u201cDysfunctional\u201d was an understatement.</p><p>\u201cLook, can this wait until we\u2019re not all freezing our balls off?\u201d Ty asked sedately as he continued to eat slowly. They\u2019d taken all the MREs they could carry from the ATV, and that was all the food they had unless they wanted to forage. \u201cThought I was done with these damn things,\u201d Ty muttered as he poked at the food.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Zane murmured, handing over the little mini-package of M&amp;Ms out of his meal.</p><p>Ty glanced at it and then up at Zane with a small, tired smile. \u201cKeep your damn chocolate,\u201d he muttered gruffly.</p><p>Deuce put his chin in his hand and watched them silently. He couldn\u2019t read Zane, but he thought the man\u2019s projected emotions were fairly straightforward. When they were visible at all. Right now, Zane was focused on Ty, and that anger appeared to be totally gone, replaced by something milder. Warmer.</p><p>But Ty? Deuce snorted. Not in love, his ass. Ty could fool Zane, maybe. He could even fool himself for a while longer. But Ty couldn\u2019t fool Deuce, not anymore.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>\u201cI GOTTA take a leak,\u201d Earflaps said petulantly.</p><p>Ty jerked and gasped, yanked from his doze by the man\u2019s voice. He shook his head and rubbed at his eyes, leaning forward to pile more sticks into the stuttering fire before looking over at the prisoner hatefully. \u201cI should let you just piss yourself,\u201d he told the man irritably.</p><p>\u201cToo bad you\u2019re a Fed,\u201d Earflaps observed.</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes and sighed. Unfortunately, the asshole was right. No cruel and unusual punishment. He muttered to himself as he unfolded his stiff limbs and stood. He gave Zane\u2019s foot a gentle nudge. Zane\u2019s eyes opened immediately. Ty should have known he wasn\u2019t asleep. Maybe he should make Zane take the guy out in the woods.</p><p>\u201cPlaying escort,\u201d he told Zane softly instead as he fished out a flashlight from the nearest pack. It was one of only two left. \u201cIf we\u2019re not back in five, come shoot him,\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Zane said, a small smile curving his lips. \u201cI\u2019ve still got more than half a magazine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Ty said with a patronizing pat of Zane\u2019s head. He moved to untie the ropes from Earflaps\u2019 ankles. He grabbed the man\u2019s coat and hefted him to his feet, bringing them nose to nose. \u201cAny funny business, I\u2019ll leave you tied up out there, got it?\u201d he threatened. Earflaps sneered at him, but then he thought better of his response and merely nodded. \u201cMove,\u201d Ty ordered as he picked up the shotgun and pushed the man in front of him. He left the flashlight off, conserving the battery while the moon was actually peeking through the clouds to give them light.</p><p>He gave the man some leeway in his wandering, partly because he knew no one back at the fire wanted to hear this guy do his business any more than he did. But also because his mind was struggling to keep up; he was tired, cold, sore, and having more and more trouble giving a shit. The only thing he did care about at this point was getting home. These mountains could make unsuspecting victims out of even the most experienced of travelers, and Ty found that he couldn\u2019t stop worrying about Zane out here. It probably hadn\u2019t been the greatest idea, dragging him up here for his first hike. But Ty was sure he\u2019d been enjoying himself before they were almost killed. Repeatedly.</p><p>He sighed heavily and slid his hands into his pockets, carrying the shotgun in the crook of his arm against his hip. He shivered slightly in the cold air. Hell. He was probably getting sick after that damn cold water. That would be his luck. Avoid the traps and the bullets and drowning and then die of pneumonia before they could get back.</p><p>The thought actually made him smile crookedly in the darkness.</p><p>He realized they\u2019d been trekking into the forest for almost five minutes before he snapped out of it. \u201cHey,\u201d he said sharply. Earflaps took a few more slow steps before stopping. \u201cThis\u2019ll do fine,\u201d Ty told him.</p><p>Earflaps looked around. \u201cTurn around,\u201d he told Ty.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell,\u201d Ty replied easily.</p><p>\u201cWell, can I go behind a tree?\u201d the man asked irritably.</p><p>Ty glared at him. He glanced around the small clearing the man had found. If he did make a run for it, Ty could easily catch him. And if he somehow escaped, there was really nowhere for him to go that didn\u2019t involve freezing to death, being eaten by an animal, or getting lost and starving. He was about to tell the man to be quick about it when a noise that was out of place caught his attention and stopped him in his verbal tracks. He tensed, cursing himself for not paying more attention and allowing Earflaps to lead him so far from the fire.</p><p>\u201cCome on, man!\u201d Earflaps whined.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty hissed. He raised his shotgun slightly. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t gonna scare me, hillbilly,\u201d Earlfaps declared stubbornly.</p><p>Ty shook his head, hushing the man again and pressing the butt of the gun against his shoulder, at the ready. A twig broke somewhere to his left, then another.</p><p>\u201cI heard that,\u201d Earflaps said, suddenly quiet and serious, looking off into the dark woods.</p><p>Ty tensed and remained motionless, a chill crawling up his spine. He instinctively felt they were being stalked, and by something with far more skill than the three treasure hunters they\u2019d been dealing with.</p><p>\u201cCome over here,\u201d Ty whispered, and Earflaps didn\u2019t argue as he began to move. \u201cSlowly!\u201d Ty hissed. Earflaps froze and glanced around nervously. Ty could relate. He resisted the urge to call out for help, knowing it might just trigger an attack. And whoever came to their aid would be in danger too. Ty couldn\u2019t have that. Even as he thought it, there was a rustling sound in the underbrush to his right. Jesus, it moved fast. That or there was more than one. A strange sound, almost like a purr, emitted from the darkness.</p><p>Ty\u2019s entire body went cold, and he began to shake almost uncontrollably as he gripped the shotgun. They were rare, but there was only one thing in these mountains that purred.</p><p>He tried to keep from breathing too heavily as he went over what little he knew about cougars. They were supposed to be endangered in these mountains, a population so sparse they were more of a myth than a fact. Ty supposed it was just his shitty luck to stumble over one. At least he now knew why there were no small animals in the area and what had been driving the snakes to lower climates.</p><p>A large cat emerged from the undergrowth, appearing suddenly and without further warning, its tan fur almost silver in the moonlight. It growled at them both, circling them warily.</p><p>\u201cOh Christ,\u201d Ty breathed as he watched it, not quite believing what he was seeing. The cat was almost two feet high at the shoulders and at least six feet long from nose to tail. When it moved its shoulders rolled and its tail swished sinuously behind it.</p><p>It was the most terrifying thing Ty had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Earflaps echoed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Ty told him. He knew that to run or play dead would just trigger the chase and kill instincts in the cat, and he forced himself to stand there and stare at it. He hoped it couldn\u2019t smell fear, or they were both dead men.</p><p>Ty knew one thing: if it had wanted to kill them, they never would have seen it coming. They\u2019d probably just stumbled too close to its babies and it was trying to warn them off. Cougars were ambush predators. He had studied the way they and other animals killed when he\u2019d been on the Recon team, curious to see if he could learn anything from them. He had learned quite a lot. He knew that cougars were solitary hunters, so he didn\u2019t have to worry about a second one anywhere. But they could leap over twenty feet in one go and run up to thirty-five miles an hour; they had a vertical of nearly fifteen feet, and when they struck, they did so from the side or rear, severing the spinal cord and then either eating their prey alive or letting it bleed out to save for later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The fact that he was staring at this one in the eyes was actually a good thing. It meant the cat wasn\u2019t sure if they were food. Yet. Not that the idea offered him a shred of comfort.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re, uh... you\u2019re supposed to stand tall,\u201d he told Earflaps breathlessly. \u201cStretch your arms out and make yourself appear as large as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Earflaps whispered back at him. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p> <p>Ty shook his head minutely. He knew what you were supposed to do. But he just couldn\u2019t force himself to move as the cat stalked back into the underbrush and disappeared. Ty had never seen anything so big that was so adept at hiding itself, even if it was dark. A part of him, the part that may or may not have been suicidal and wasn\u2019t terrified into stupidity, took a moment to admire the ability.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Earflaps mumbled softly. Ty could see his breath misting in the cold air. He trembled with the urge to flee from the danger. Ty could understand the impulse.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Ty told him again. The man didn\u2019t respond, but Ty could see his body coiling in the moonlight. He knew he was fighting the same instinct to run that Ty was. He was losing the fight, though. \u201cDon\u2019t move, man,\u201d Ty practically pleaded. He raised the shotgun, more for comfort than actually thinking it would do much good if the cat came at him from behind.</p><p>Earflaps jerked suddenly and broke into a run. Ty shouted at him, but the man either didn\u2019t hear him or didn\u2019t care. He hadn\u2019t gone four steps before there was a loud screech. The underbrush whispered with the movement, and the cougar yowled again as it pounced on Earflaps\u2019 back and knocked him to the ground. Earflaps gave a horrible scream as Ty brought the shotgun around and fired. The cougar flinched, giving another keening cry as it leapt away, disappearing silently into the darkness.</p><p>Ty stood breathing hard and staring, straining his eyes as he moved forward cautiously. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d hit the cougar, but the sound of the shot had at least scared it off. For now. After a brief moment, he rushed toward the fallen man and laid the gun to the side, yanking off his coat to press it to the gaping wound on the man\u2019s neck. Flashes of the past assaulted him, holding his camouflaged clothing to the wound of a dear friend as he died in Ty\u2019s arms, so far from home.</p> <p>Ty gasped as the warm blood flowed through his fingers. The man grabbed at his wrists, looking up at him with terrified eyes, unnaturally white in the moonlight that filtered into the clearing.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Ty told him breathlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d he told him, knowing the man wouldn\u2019t make it long enough to call him a liar. Even as he tried to stem the bleeding, the life drained from his prisoner\u2019s eyes, and Earflaps fell limp, the blood still gushing from the rips in his throat.</p><p>ZANE\u2019S head jerked up and a shiver ran down his spine as the scream echoed through the trees. He was on his feet, gun in hand, without even thinking about it, turning toward where he thought the scream might have originated. Then his brain kicked into gear. That wasn\u2019t Ty screaming. It couldn\u2019t be. It was Earflaps. Shit. Had Ty actually lost it and shot him? Or did Earflaps rush Ty in the dark?</p><p>It all added up to him needing to be there, now, and see what was happening. See if Ty was okay. And if he wasn\u2019t, Zane would deal with it. They were both getting off this damn mountain alive.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Deuce demanded dazedly as he rolled to his hands and knees.</p><p>\u201cSounds like he shot him,\u201d Earl guessed roughly as he stumbled over the fire and grabbed for the second shotgun. \u201cGarrett?\u201d he barked as he stood and peered out into the pitch-black woods.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going, Earl,\u201d Zane answered flatly as he checked his gun. \u201cStay with Deuce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett,\u201d Earl said again sharply. When Zane looked up at him, Earl was staring at him determinedly. \u201cYou bring him back,\u201d Earl told him quietly.</p><p>Zane stared at him for just a moment, surprised at the lack of argument, but then he nodded curtly and turned to lope into the darkness in what he hoped was the right direction. If Ty had killed the man, he might not be in the most stable state of mind. Zane hoped Ty seeing his partner would be enough to snap him out of it.</p><p>TY CLOSED his eyes as he moved his bloody hands away from the dead man, but then his eyes were on the underbrush once more as his hand groped blindly for the shotgun. If he was going to be eaten, he wanted to see it coming. And he would damn sure to put up a fight. He knew the others would have heard the shot and probably the screaming. But that didn\u2019t mean they would find him in the dark woods. Not in time, anyway. He even thought maybe he could hear them calling out, but he didn\u2019t dare call back.</p><p>His hand landed on a decent-sized rock. Ty palmed it, still feeling around with the other hand for the gun. What the hell had he done with it? He tore his eyes away from the trees to search the ground. The barrel shone dully in the moonlight, roughly six feet away. As he crawled slowly toward it, he found a thick tree branch that was still fairly green and hefted it. The more weapons he had on him until he made it to the gun, the less he felt like kibble.</p><p>Ty felt the movement at his side rather than saw it, and he turned and tried to rise to face it, striking out with the stick as the cougar came at him with horrifying speed. He didn\u2019t make it to his feet, though. The impact knocked him to the ground, the big cat landing on him and knocking the breath from his lungs. He saw stars as his head banged against the hard ground. The cat caught the stick between its sharp teeth, and it snapped in half like a desiccated twig, showering Ty\u2019s face with bits of wood. The cougar\u2019s claws scraped across his shoulder and tore into the skin.</p><p>Ty screamed in agony even as he held what remained of the stick in front of his throat, trying to protect himself. He cried out again as teeth sank into his hand. He dropped the stick as he lost feeling in the hand but rounded with the stone in his other hand, smacking the cat in the side of the head with it. It made a dull thud when it hit, and the cat leaped away and hissed at him angrily, lashing out with one giant paw. Ty rolled out of its reach, narrowly missing being lacerated by the impressive claws. He found himself on top of his shotgun, and he grabbed it gratefully, rolling again and coming to sit with it clutched to his chest.</p><p>The cat shook its head, pawing at its ear where Ty had landed the blow, tail twitching as it sized him up again. Ty pushed up onto his knees and threw the rock at it, sending it scampering backward a few feet with a low growl. He gripped the gun and struggled to his feet unsteadily, surprised when he weaved a little, wielding the shotgun almost like a baseball bat with both hands until he could grip it correctly and aim it.</p> <p>The cougar continued to watch him warily, obviously deciding that he might not be an easy kill after all. Ty could feel blood dripping down his fingers as he gripped the gun, and he didn\u2019t know if it was his blood or the other man\u2019s. The cougar made a grumbling, growling sound in its throat as it slinked toward the body lying in the brush. Ty realized belatedly that the big cat must have thought he was after its meal.</p><p>\u201cTake him,\u201d Ty told the cat breathlessly. \u201cEat him. He won\u2019t care now,\u201d he said as he began backing away.</p><p>The cat hissed one more time, bared its impressive teeth, and then took Earflaps by his ruined neck and began dragging him into the forest. It locked eyes with Ty, neither looking away until the cat dematerialized into the woods.</p><p>Ty listened intently, holding his breath as he waited for the telltale breaking of twigs that signified the cougar making a hasty retreat. He heard none, though. It was still out there. Watching him. He lowered the shotgun as his entire body began to tremble. He\u2019d just been attacked by a fucking mountain lion.</p><p>And he was not handling it well.</p><p>\u201cTy!\u201d It was Zane\u2019s voice, somewhere close, coming out of the darkness. Ty could hear rustling approaching from behind him.</p><p>Ty held his breath a moment, weighing the benefit of calling out versus being eaten. \u201cGarrett!\u201d he called back after a few seconds. His voice was filled with panic and near-terror. He backed away another step. The shotgun shook in his trembling hands.</p><p>There was an immediate shift of direction in the movement behind him, and he could hear Zane running toward him, amazingly sure-footed in the darkness, he thought distantly. Time dragged as Ty tried to watch all around him, listening hard, but it couldn\u2019t have been more than thirty seconds before Zane skidded to a stop not too far away and called his name again.</p><p>\u201cSlowly, Garrett,\u201d Ty managed to call back, though his voice was still shaking with fear and adrenaline.</p><p>Zane went still for a long moment before he started moving, one step at a time. Then he appeared out of the darkness at Ty\u2019s side, his gun held ready. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Zane said under his breath, surprise and something darker in his voice. \u201cI heard gunfire and screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ate him,\u201d Ty answered without moving. Somewhere in his mind, he knew it sounded astoundingly stupid. But it was the best he could articulate.</p><p>Zane, for some reason, didn\u2019t act like it was odd at all. Maybe it was the stunned look on Ty\u2019s face, or the fact that his entire body trembled, or that he was covered in blood.</p><p>\u201cCan you get back to camp?\u201d Zane asked, turning so his back was to Ty\u2019s as he looked at the darkness around them.</p><p>Ty nodded jerkily, backing up until his back was pressed against Zane\u2019s. \u201cCount of three,\u201d he said shakily. \u201cWe run.\u201d He remembered the last time they\u2019d counted to three, cornered by kids with paintball guns. Ty had used Zane as a distraction, as a human shield. Ty gritted his teeth as the shaking in his hands subsided suddenly. He\u2019d take on that mountain lion with his bare hands before it touched Zane; he knew that much for certain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m facing twelve,\u201d Zane said to him quietly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to three o\u2019clock.\u201d Ty nodded in acknowledgment. \u201cCount,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>The brush shivered in the moonlight as Ty watched it. He swallowed hard and said a shaky, \u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>Zane shifted his weight in preparation to move. \u201cTwo.\u201d</p><p>Ty spared the dark woods one more careful look before he reached behind him and pushed at Zane\u2019s hip. \u201cThree!\u201d he shouted, and they turned and ran as fast as they could through the darkness.</p><p>Zane led him back to the camp, where Ty knew the fire and the scent of more people would provide safety. Adrenaline still rushed through him, and he didn\u2019t know how badly wounded he might be. Nothing hurt yet, at least. He just knew they needed to get to safety before the cat came back for more.</p><p>When Ty and Zane broke through trees and into the circle of light and warmth from the fire, Earl was waiting with a flashlight and a large hunting knife. As Ty stumbled, he grabbed the shotgun out of his hands; Deuce stood with his shotgun drawn, looking out into the woods, ready to fire at anything that came after them. Ty slid to the ground and grabbed at the end of one of the sticks in the fire, turning with the flaming branch in his hand and breathing hard as he waited. For whatever reason, he felt better with the branch than he had with the shotgun. Probably because he\u2019d missed with the fucking shotgun the first time.</p><p>But the forest was quiet. Nothing came out of the woods after him. A bird chirped somewhere in the distance, and another happily answered the call. The fire crackled merrily, and the only sounds were Zane\u2019s and Ty\u2019s harsh breaths as they tried to pull air in.</p><p>Finally, Ty lowered the stick in his hand and looked down at it abashedly before tossing it back in the fire. The others lowered their weapons and turned to look at him doubtfully, like he might have finally had that mental breakdown they were all expecting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Ty mumbled to them. \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d Ty said flatly, cutting Deuce\u2019s question off.</p><p>\u201cGone? What happened?\u201d Deuce demanded.</p><p>The flashlight played over Ty, and Earl stopped it at his hands. \u201cJesus Christ, boy,\u201d Earl grunted as he came closer. Zane appeared at Ty\u2019s side, shoving his gun into his waistband, putting a steadying hand against Ty\u2019s back.</p><p>Ty looked down to see that blood was dripping down his fingers, running freely and obscuring the sources so they couldn\u2019t see how many punctures there were or how badly his hand was torn up. His entire front was covered in blood, in fact. Some his, spreading from the scratches on his shoulders, but most of it belonged to the dead man.</p><p>He held his hand up and peered closely at it in the wavering firelight. \u201cFuck, man, I just got that out of a cast,\u201d he said in annoyance. \u201cBring that light,\u201d he requested as Earl stopped in front of him and shined the light down on his hand. He could discern at least four separate punctures, one of which was so deep that Ty thought it might actually have hit the bone. His fingers were stiffening up quickly, and his hand was beginning to throb. The knuckle of his ring finger was swollen and turning blue. \u201cHell,\u201d he cursed in defeat. He supposed he was lucky that he still had the hand at all, considering he could have yanked out the cat\u2019s tonsils at one point.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Deuce demanded.</p><p>Ty shook his head as Earl yanked the buff off Ty\u2019s head and used it to make a rough tourniquet around his forearm. The buff wouldn\u2019t go tight enough to do much good, though, and Zane went to dig in his backpack.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d Earl asked as Ty tried to calm his breathing.</p><p>\u201cCat jumped us,\u201d Ty answered in a surprised voice. \u201cAte him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cougar?\u201d Earl asked in shock.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty answered, still in disbelief. He held his hand up as it began throbbing angrily, trying to slow the blood flow to the wounds.</p><p>\u201cI thought cougars in these parts was just hearsay,\u201d Earl said in surprise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll be sure to report the sighting to fucking Fish and Game when we get home,\u201d Ty snapped as he sat down heavily beside the fire. His entire body was shaking. The firelight flickered off the blood streaming down his hand and forearm.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Zane said quietly as he knelt beside Ty with a shirt he\u2019d yanked out of his backpack. Ty recognized it, actually. Zane had worn it the day they drove up here. It was one of Zane\u2019s favorites. \u201cLook at me, all right?\u201d Zane used the shirt in one hand to start mopping up the blood on Ty\u2019s shoulder and down his arm, and the other hand settled on Ty\u2019s knee to squeeze gently.</p><p>Ty looked up at him obediently. His hand trembled in Zane\u2019s. He\u2019d been trained to face danger of all kinds, but he supposed nothing overrode the very distinct knowledge that you were about to be dinner.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d Zane said quietly but clearly. \u201cJust focus on me for a few minutes. What\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind?\u201d While talking, he was gently wiping away the blood.</p><p>Ty blinked at him, opening his mouth as he thought the very first thing that came to mind when Zane prompted him. I love you. He snapped his mouth closed and stared at Zane, unable and unwilling to answer.</p><p>Zane frowned a little. \u201cTy?\u201d His head tipped to one side as he looked Ty over, probably for more injuries. \u201cAre you hurt somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed hard, his mouth suddenly dry as he tried to answer. He cleared his throat and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he finally managed to utter. The truth was, he had no idea. His entire body was numb, not to mention his mind was reeling as he watched Zane.</p><p>\u201cDeuce, would you get a canteen, please?\u201d Zane requested, his eyes not wavering from Ty\u2019s face.</p> <p>Ty cleared his throat uncomfortably and tore his eyes away from Zane\u2019s, afraid of what he might say if he continued to look at him. He glanced around uncertainly. Earl was rummaging through the first-aid kit, not paying them any mind as he searched for ointment and bandages, but Deuce was standing over them with his hands on his hips, watching them closely, and he nodded at Zane\u2019s request as Ty looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Deuce said, and he limped over toward his backpack.</p><p>Zane\u2019s hand on Ty\u2019s cheek brought his attention back to his partner. \u201cHey. You with me?\u201d Zane asked, the concern clear on his face and in his eyes. \u201cYou have any more of the... falling?\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed hard again. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that, Zane,\u201d he admitted roughly.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t try to make light. He nodded and continued to wipe at the blood on Ty\u2019s shaky hand. \u201cI\u2019ve got your back,\u201d he promised.</p><p>Ty nodded jerkily. He cleared his throat again, finally feeling the embarrassment. He looked down at his hand for lack of anything better to do. \u201cIt\u2019s bleeding a lot,\u201d he said in a surprised voice as he looked at his fingers in the light of the fire.</p> <p>Zane must have noticed his discomfort, because he released Ty\u2019s hand as Deuce lowered himself carefully to a knee, offering the canteen to Ty.</p><p>\u201cA cat?\u201d Deuce asked dubiously.</p><p>\u201cIt was a big cat,\u201d Ty insisted as he held his hand up. He watched as several drops of blood dripped off his wrist. It looked like he\u2019d stuck it in a blender.</p><p>Earl muttered as he knelt beside Deuce and took Ty\u2019s hand. He raised it up to look at it. \u201cWon\u2019t be able to get this fixed up real good until daylight,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cShould cauterize it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no,\u201d Ty protested as he tried to jerk his hand away. Earl\u2019s grip tightened, and he looked at Ty pointedly. \u201cWe\u2019ll just clean it real good and double-time it in the morning, okay?\u201d Ty bargained.</p><p>Earl raised an eyebrow but nodded in agreement. \u201cWash it up real good,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Ty muttered. His father handed Deuce the ointment and bandages and then went to get water. Ty glanced over at Zane, who was watching him silently. \u201cShut up,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Chapter 15</p> <p>AS ZANE and Earl packed their bags at sunup, Deuce hunkered down, took Ty\u2019s hand, and frowned at the wounds. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d he asked as he poked at Ty\u2019s palm. Ty nearly choked on the water he\u2019d been gulping down and wrenched his hand away with a hoarse curse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a \u2018yes\u2019,\u201d Zane said wryly as he stopped next to them.</p><p>\u201cWe need to wrap it,\u201d Earl advised. He turned around, his hands on his hips and a scowl set on his face. \u201cYou need to protect it while you\u2019re walking. You need to keep it as still as possible, keep it up. We\u2019ll have to immobilize it somehow.\u201d</p><p>Ty resisted the urge to growl. It was a nuisance, but he knew his father was right. Bites were nasty business at any time, but out here where they were miles away from anything resembling sanitary conditions, it could turn deadly very fast. Of all the wounds the others had suffered during their escapades, this was probably the most dangerous, as embarrassing as it was. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Ty muttered with a nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a clean T-shirt,\u201d Deuce mumbled as he climbed to his feet.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips twitched as he stayed there next to Ty. He crouched down next to his partner. \u201cSo. Just a nice stretch of the legs on the mountain. No problem,\u201d he said conversationally.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not entirely going to plan,\u201d Ty muttered as he looked away from Zane, flushing a bit.</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cWith us, when does it ever?\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced over at him, met his eyes for a moment, and smirked crookedly. \u201cI can think of a few times.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met briefly, and Ty felt more words on the tip of his tongue, but the jarring sound of material ripping interrupted any further conversation. Deuce was methodically cutting a brown T-shirt into thin strips. \u201cHey!\u201d Ty called out. \u201cNot that one!\u201d he protested as he pointed at the shirt. The Schitt Creek Paddle Co. shirt was one of his very favorites. \u201cThat\u2019s a lucky shirt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal with it, Meow Mix,\u201d Deuce advised as he carefully draped the strips over his shoulder to keep them clean.</p><p>\u201cThe Phillies will never win again if you tear up that shirt,\u201d Ty told Deuce threateningly.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need your lucky shirts,\u201d Deuce claimed with a smirk. \u201cSave those for your damn Redskins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can get a new shirt,\u201d Zane pointed out. \u201cNew hand, not so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew hand, nothing,\u201d Earl broke in as he knelt and began rummaging through his pack. \u201cIt gets infected and you won\u2019t make it off the mountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing a little dramatic about it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Ty asked him with a small, hopeful smile.</p><p>His father turned his head and met his eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Standing up, Zane took Ty\u2019s good hand and pulled him to his feet. When Ty stood, though, his head swam, and he wavered. Zane placed a supportive hand on his lower back. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, his voice exposing new concern.</p><p>Ty nodded and brushed him off. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he muttered as he looked down at his hand. \u201cOkay,\u201d he sighed as he started trying to think of a way to immobilize the wounded fingers. Earl was right\u2014the less he moved them the better. If an infection did get into the joints, it would spread faster if he were using the fingers. Besides, they hurt like a bitch.</p><p>Ty looked around the clearing, frustrated by how muddled his thoughts seemed to be. The pain when he kept his hand at his side was distracting, and he raised it up and cradled it to his chest unconsciously.</p><p>Finally, he turned and looked back at Zane appraisingly. \u201cHow much of your gear do you really need?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust the canteen. Everything else important is on me,\u201d Zane answered. Ty knew he meant his weapons. \u201cThe duffel we can leave behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Ty corrected as he made a \u201chand it over\u201d gesture with his good fingers. \u201cThe duffel\u2019s what I need.\u201d</p><p>Frowning again, Zane shrugged and took the several steps to snag it and bring it back, holding it out for Ty to take.</p><p>Ty nodded his thanks and took the bag, unzipping it with difficulty as he knelt. He dumped the contents onto the ground and then slid the hunting knife from its sheath at his thigh and began slicing into the thick padding of the shoulder straps.</p><p>Zane watched as Ty started cutting up the bag. \u201cAre you making a sling?\u201d he asked after a few moments.</p><p>\u201cNo, but that would have been brilliant of me,\u201d Ty answered as he glanced up at Zane and smiled slightly. \u201cI\u2019m making a splint,\u201d he added as the smile fell. \u201cPretty sure something broke in there. A little wrapping with that damn duct tape and this padding should be hard enough to do it.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Zane knelt down next to him and grabbed the roll of silver duct tape they\u2019d been using to tape the prisoners up. \u201cLet\u2019s get you wrapped up then,\u201d Zane said to him.</p><p>Ty knew that he couldn\u2019t manage the feat with just one hand, and he relented with a grunt of displeasure. \u201cTry to mold it as you wrap it,\u201d he advised as he held out his injured hand in the shape that would work best. \u201cJust curve the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave the man alone, boy, he\u2019s got sense enough to know basic first aid,\u201d Earl chastised as he clunked down a small plastic box.</p><p>Zane raised an eyebrow as he followed Ty\u2019s instructions, making the mold fit the natural curve of his hand. Ty watched him as he wrapped it rather than watching his progress. Every time he thought too hard on it, an uncomfortable tightness formed in his throat and butterflies assaulted him. At least he now he knew the truth about himself and Zane. Looking raptly into Zane\u2019s dark eyes, Ty wondered why he hadn\u2019t realized he loved the man earlier.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it? Really,\u201d Zane asked, looking up to meet Ty\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Ty swallowed hard. \u201cHurts worse than I thought it would,\u201d he answered in a barely audible voice. Whether he was talking about his hand or something more, he really couldn\u2019t have said.</p><p>He shook off any more thoughts along those lines and cleared his throat. He would let himself ponder that once they were off this mountain and in the clear.</p><p>He looked down at his hand and examined it, holding it out toward Zane. His shoulders ached where the cougar\u2019s claws had sunk in, but his hand was the true problem. The side of it where the shallowest punctures had been was bruised and swollen, and the entire hand was red and painful. The two knuckles of his pinkie and ring fingers were twice the size they were supposed to be, and all his fingers were swollen and bruised as well. There was a puncture on his palm that made it impossible to grip anything hard. And since he\u2019d wrenched his hand away from the pain when the cat had bitten down, the punctures weren\u2019t just deep, they were rips that had torn up the skin, making it harder for the wounds to close. In fact, he\u2019d had gunshots that were less painful than his hand was right now.</p><p>\u201cHurts,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIt ain\u2019t infected, though,\u201d he surmised with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on it, tough guy,\u201d Zane murmured as he kept wrapping the modified brace with the tape to bulk it up and make it stiff. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to carry you out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be the first time,\u201d Ty assured him as Earl stepped closer and handed him a small tin of Rawleigh\u2019s antibiotic ointment. \u201cThanks,\u201d Ty said as he looked up at his father and took the tin.</p><p>Earl swished a bottle of water at him. \u201cTime to clean it again,\u201d he said grimly. Cleaning it the night before had been painful enough. Ty thought he might have whimpered through the whole process.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Ty muttered as his father chuckled and took the mangled backpack and Ty\u2019s knife just as Deuce held up the cloth, indicating for Zane to take the canteen.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty glared at him. \u201cJust do it quick,\u201d he requested.</p><p>Glancing to Deuce, Zane waited until he nodded to start pouring the water in a thin, slow stream. Deuce held the cloth under it briefly, took Ty\u2019s hand, and began scrubbing at it, hard and fast. Ty just closed his eyes and turned his head slightly, breathing in the cool air of the mountain as the little torn bits of skin were ripped up and away. It wasn\u2019t as bad as he\u2019d been expecting. He supposed most of the pain was coming from the bruising rather than the open wounds. He was almost positive the nerves around those were all dead, now, anyway.</p><p>When he looked back down at it, most of the dried blood that had caked his fingers and palm was gone, and Deuce was slathering it with ointment and wrapping it carefully with the strips of his T-shirt.</p><p>Ty sighed and looked up at his father, who was standing aside and watching with a frown. He met his dad\u2019s eyes and gave a weak smile. They both knew how bad this could turn.</p><p>Zane picked up the mold he\u2019d made and held it out. \u201cAll right, into the splint,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ty placed his hand into it, wincing as his palm settled. Deuce waited until Ty gave him a nod; then he began anchoring the splint to Ty\u2019s arm with an Ace bandage from the first aid kit.</p><p>\u201cI gotcha a sling, here,\u201d Earl announced as he held up what had once been Deuce\u2019s spare pack. \u201cMight be better off without it,\u201d he advised.</p><p>Ty shook his head. He needed to keep it up more than he needed that hand to walk. \u201cLet me have the damn thing,\u201d he muttered as he pulled his hand away from Zane and stood slowly. He\u2019d found if he rose too quickly, his head would swim and his vision would blur. He pulled the straps of the mangled backpack close to his body, essentially tying his arm to his chest. It would fuck with his balance and probably end up making him fall on his face, but it was better than the alternative. When he\u2019d adjusted it, he flopped his good hand to his side and looked around at the others. \u201cLet\u2019s divvy up the shit and get going,\u201d he suggested. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Earl and Deuce picked through the rest of the supplies spilled on the ground, Zane stood slowly, only a couple feet from Ty, keeping his eyes on him the whole time. He took a step closer and reached out to untwist one of the straps and tie it more securely. \u201cThere you go,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Ty found it difficult to meet his eyes as he thought about a similar action Zane had taken in a New York hotel room almost a year ago. Now, just as then, his heart beat a little faster because of it. But he nodded in thanks and smiled as he tried to fight back the hint of warmth it caused. I love you. The thought had haunted him all night, almost as much as the sound of the cougar\u2019s scream.</p><p>Zane\u2019s fingers lingered where Ty\u2019s T-shirt met his neck, pressing against the warm skin for just a few moments longer than necessary. \u201cCome on. There\u2019s beer and apple pie waiting,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait,\u201d Ty muttered. He reached out and socked Zane in the stomach as soon as the other two men had turned away and started off down the trail.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Zane huffed, rubbing the spot as he hefted the remaining backpack. \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>Ty grinned crookedly and began laughing softly. \u201cYou\u2019re carrying my shit over mountain trails. You\u2019re officially a jackass.\u201d</p><p>Zane skipped a step to catch up as they started walking. \u201cI vaguely remember you carrying me around. What does that make you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hero,\u201d Ty countered with a smirk.</p> <p>Zane snorted as they sped their steps, hiking after the other two men. \u201cSo now you\u2019re going to admit it, huh? None of that \u2018I was just helping my partner\u2019 shit you gave in the reports?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty grunted, suddenly uncomfortable with the discussion.</p><p>\u201cHumility doesn\u2019t suit you, Grady. Now step it up,\u201d Zane said as he stepped over a log fallen across the narrow trail.</p><p>Ty muttered to himself as he walked ahead of Zane. His hand throbbed angrily with every beat of his heart, and the punctures burned under the makeshift bandages. He didn\u2019t say anything to the others, though; he just tried to keep pace with them. The closer they got to civilization, the better off they were. And they had a long way to go.</p><p>\u201cMRS. Grady, I understand that you\u2019re worried,\u201d the ranger was saying patiently as Mara and Chester stood together in front of him. Mara\u2019s jaw was set firm, and her green eyes flashed as Chester stood beside her, leaning on his shovel. \u201cBut they\u2019re not even a day late,\u201d the ranger continued, looking askance at the shovel. \u201cEarl\u2019s missed his schedule by a lot more than this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time\u2019s different, Dale,\u201d Mara insisted stubbornly. She had awakened that morning with an odd feeling in the pit of her stomach, and she couldn\u2019t seem to shake it. She tried to tell herself it was just the change to her routine that was causing it, or the fact that Chester had been awake and dressed, ready to ride with her to the ranger station. But deep down, she knew she\u2019d never convince herself. Something was wrong on the mountain today.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not technically missing yet,\u201d Dale tried to reason with her, putting his hands out almost defensively.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four hours could kill a man in those mountains, and you know it!\u201d Mara told him angrily.</p><p>\u201cBeen awful cold up there,\u201d Chester informed him calmly.</p><p>\u201cYour boys are more than capable of handling themselves on the mountain,\u201d Dale reminded with a hint of admiration. Dale had gone to school with Ty and Deuce; he knew them and what they were capable of. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do until we get some kind of word that there\u2019s trouble,\u201d Dale told them in a voice that was almost pleading with her to understand. \u201cWe\u2019re short-handed as it is in the offseason.\u201d</p><p>Mara lifted her chin and glared at him silently, looking around at the other two rangers who stood in the office, trying desperately not to get in the line of fire. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna go search for my boys \u2019til morning?\u201d Mara questioned in a calm voice.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Grady, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, we\u2019re gonna need to borrow two guns, some britches, and a daypack,\u201d she interrupted as she looked back at Dale.</p><p>He stared at her with his mouth hanging slightly open. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked dumbly.</p> <p>\u201cYou heard the woman, sonny!\u201d Chester shouted as he brought the shovel up and slammed it onto the desk beside Dale, narrowly missing his fingers. Dale jumped and flinched away from the sharp tip.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I certainly can\u2019t go up there in nothing but my dress,\u201d Mara reasoned with him, \u201cand I don\u2019t have time to go driving all the way back home to get Earl\u2019s rifle.\u201d</p><p>He continued to stare at them, shaking his head helplessly.</p><p>Chester hefted the shovel and rested it on his shoulder, narrowing his clear blue eyes. Mara crossed her arms stubbornly. \u201cAnd some extra ammunition,\u201d she requested of Dale.</p><p>Dale sighed and slumped his shoulders, sitting back against his desk and rubbing at a spot of tension on his forehead. He looked back up at her as she stood there waiting, his eyes flickering to Chester and his shovel warily as he cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cJerry, call down and have them start up the search-and-rescue team,\u201d Dale requested of one of the other rangers in the office. The man hopped up gratefully and went to go get the local volunteer search and rescue squad on the horn.</p><p>Mara nodded at the young ranger. \u201cThank you, Dale. You\u2019re a good boy,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said in defeat as she and Chester turned and made their way out of the office.</p><p>ZANE paused next to Ty for a couple deep breaths at the top of another hill on the grassy path. When he stopped, Ty glanced at him, and Zane got a good look at his partner. His face was flushed, but other than that, he looked like he was taking a walk in the park. It made Zane worry that the flush was from fever and not exertion.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Ty asked him.</p><p>Zane nodded even though he was slightly winded. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurts,\u201d Ty responded as he lowered his head again.</p><p>That worried him. It was the second time Ty had admitted to the pain, and Ty wouldn\u2019t admit to pain unless it was bad or he wanted to be coddled. And Zane knew he didn\u2019t want to be coddled in front of his father and brother. He studied Ty\u2019s face. \u201cThrobbing? Burning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle of both,\u201d Ty answered curtly as he looked out over the trail ahead. \u201cHey, Dad,\u201d he called as he unscrewed the top of his canteen with his thumb. \u201cI think we need to check this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurts?\u201d Earl asked worriedly as he brushed past Zane on his way back to Ty.</p><p>\u201cHurts,\u201d Ty echoed as Earl\u2019s back obscured Zane\u2019s view of what they were doing. He could tell Earl was unwrapping the makeshift cast and examining the wounds, though.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the verdict, Dad?\u201d Deuce asked after a quiet minute.</p><p>Earl was silent for a moment, still holding Ty\u2019s hand and looking at it closely. Finally, he shook his head. \u201cHand\u2019s hot,\u201d he answered grimly.</p><p>\u201cInfected?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>\u201cRed\u2019s just setting in,\u201d Earl responded. \u201cIf I had to guess, I\u2019d say that cat lost a bit of tooth in that knuckle,\u201d he added as he turned Ty\u2019s hand over and began rewrapping it with extreme care. Zane\u2019s stomach plummeted with the news.</p><p>\u201cWe just need to get within range of a cell tower or ranger station,\u201d Deuce offered calmly. \u201cAnd hell, Ma and Grandpa probably got the cavalry all riled up by now.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced up at the canopy. There was no fucking way they\u2019d be able to see a cell tower through all the trees. He looked back at Deuce and Earl. Neither man seemed at all bothered by the news. Ty\u2019s hand was probably infected, he was already showing signs of fever, and they still had two days of hard hiking before they could reach help. Ty would probably be septic before then.</p><p>\u201cWe go,\u201d Zane said firmly. \u201cAnd we go as quickly as we can.\u201d</p><p>BY THE time Earl stopped them for the night, it was long past dark. Normally, as soon as the sun began to set, he would have called a halt. Hiking in these mountains was dangerous enough in the daylight. But he could feel the heavy hand of time pressing at his back now, and so he\u2019d pushed them until he could no longer discern the path in the moonlight.</p><p>They had made decent time, but Earl knew they weren\u2019t going to get far enough fast enough, even with the pace he was setting. By morning, Ty would be even weaker, possibly even unable to continue on. Earl knew he couldn\u2019t carry his son with broken ribs. If Ty became too weak to go on, it would be up to Zane to pull him through. And Earl was beginning to think that perhaps Zane could manage the feat. He\u2019d certainly gotten Ty out of those woods with no regard for his own safety going in and had been willing to do the same in the river. He\u2019d killed a man to save Ty\u2019s life without blinking an eye. Earl wasn\u2019t worried anymore about Ty having a partner worthy of him, not after this week.</p><p>As Deuce got a small fire going, Earl sat on a fallen log and watched Ty closely. He was shivering, tired and listless as he sat next to his partner. Earl glanced from Zane to Deuce and back. They\u2019d both spoken up for Ty, and Earl knew anyone who would stand up to Earl had some steel in them.</p><p>His eyes settled on Ty again. His oldest son had never done anything to deserve all the weight that had been put on his shoulders. Earl knew he\u2019d never been easy on either Ty or Deuce. He expected certain things from them, expected them to be strong and capable, self-sufficient and dependable, loyal and fair. He expected them to think and do for themselves, to be good to and protect their mama, and to respect those who deserved it.</p><p>Earl\u2019s eyes closed slowly. Ty was a good son. He was a good man. He\u2019d been a good Marine and he was a good federal agent. He was a lot of things. But he was no coward, and Earl had never even dreamed of thinking he was. Earl had said it in the heat of the moment, knowing it would put Ty into action, and he\u2019d been angry at himself ever since for doing it, continuing to take the unfamiliar emotion out on the boys because he didn\u2019t know what else to do with it. He would have to make it right with more than a simple apology. Soon.</p><p>Ty was getting along with everyone\u2019s help on the trail. He was pale, though, and every few minutes, he would simply shiver violently as his body fought the infection spreading through it. It was painful to know he was hurting and not be able to do anything about it. His boy might die up here, and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do but sleep until daybreak.</p><p>His boy might die up here, all because Earl had called him a coward.</p><p>Earl lowered his head, telling himself not to think too hard on it any longer. Not until the danger had passed. Tears wouldn\u2019t cure Ty\u2019s wounds.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it feeling?\u201d Deuce asked Ty as he poked at the flames and fed two more small sticks into the fire.</p><p>\u201cHurts,\u201d Ty grunted. \u201cFeels like my fingers are on fire. Feels like my whole body\u2019s on fire,\u201d he corrected as he leaned slightly to one side against Zane\u2019s conveniently close shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe could try cleaning it again,\u201d Deuce suggested doubtfully. His tone of voice said he knew it wouldn\u2019t do any good, and he knew Ty would turn down the offer.</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>\u201cWe should keep going,\u201d Deuce said as he turned to meet Earl\u2019s eyes, asking for permission to do so. \u201cMe and Ty, we should keep going and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t watch the trail and me at the same time,\u201d Ty broke in.</p><p>\u201cWe still have the one flashlight, we could make ten miles by morning,\u201d Deuce argued.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re safer together,\u201d Zane ground out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dying, Zane. We should be going as fast as possible,\u201d Deuce insisted.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make that pace,\u201d Ty pointed out derisively. \u201cI can barely walk a straight line.\u201d</p><p>Deuce opened his mouth to respond, but Earl held up his hand and closed his eyes. Both of his sons snapped their mouths shut and lowered their heads, the argument ending before it could get in full swing.</p><p>\u201cWe stay together,\u201d Earl ordered in a gruff voice. \u201cWe head out at first light. Not before. Ty\u2019s right,\u201d he said pointedly as he looked at Deuce. \u201cHe\u2019s too weak to be trusted on a dangerous trail,\u201d he said as he turned his eyes to Ty. Ty visibly flinched at his words, lowering his head. Zane watched his partner and then looked up to stare at Earl through the firelight.</p><p>\u201cGet some sleep,\u201d Earl continued, not commenting on the reactions. He could feel the unspoken accusations in Zane\u2019s eyes. But despite what Zane Garrett might think, Earl knew his own son and how to handle him. Ty would walk through Hell and back to prove he could do something he wasn\u2019t supposed to be able to do. Earl was determined to keep him walking no matter how much it hurt both of them. \u201cFour hours to daylight,\u201d he said roughly. He didn\u2019t look at Zane or his sons again, instead stretching out on the bedroll with his back to the fire.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want them to see the tears that threatened in his eyes.</p><p>WHEN Deuce awoke to the sound of chirping birds, his first thought was to chuck a rock at them. When he talked himself out of that, his mind turned to his brother, and he rolled over with a groan to check on Ty. He and Zane had placed Ty between them the night before, hoping to keep him warm during the chilly night.</p><p>Ty had thrashed and grumbled almost the entire night, fighting the fever and the periodic shivers that ran through him. But he was resting peacefully now, curled against Zane\u2019s left side as if he were cold. Zane\u2019s arm was wrapped around him, holding him close and keeping him warm. It would almost have been sweet under other circumstances, but Ty was too still. A bolt of cold fear shot through Deuce as he reached out to touch him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He calmed when Ty mumbled at him and tried to bury his head under Zane. He was hot to the touch and far too pale, but he was still breathing, and that was all Deuce could ask for this morning.</p><p>\u201cTy, wake up,\u201d Deuce said as he sat up and shook Ty\u2019s arm. Ty groaned and rolled, burrowing further against Zane, who opened his eyes to look at Deuce blearily. \u201cCome on, G-Man,\u201d Deuce grunted as he shook his brother harder.</p><p>Ty awoke with a jerk and a gasp. He tried to sit up and reach for a knife Deuce knew he used to keep under his pillow, but the pillow wasn\u2019t there, and neither was the knife. He looked around wildly for a brief moment, obviously trying to figure out where he was, why his hand was tied to his body, and probably wondering why he was awake. That was, if his fevered mind even allowed him to think instead of instinctively reacting.</p> <p>For all Deuce knew, Ty might think he was back in the Gulf with his Recon team.</p><p>Zane sat up and slid a hand gently up and down Ty\u2019s back, trying to calm him with soft murmurs Deuce couldn\u2019t make out. It seemed to help, and Deuce carefully watched reality seep back into Ty\u2019s eyes before he said or did anything. Even hurt and unarmed, Deuce knew his brother could be a dangerous man, especially if he was disoriented. Deuce would never have risked touching him in that state. Apparently that danger didn\u2019t apply to Zane Garrett. Something else to add to the list of things that didn\u2019t quite add up.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Deuce asked evenly.</p><p>Ty nodded and swallowed hard as he looked down at his hand.</p><p>\u201cDizzy?\u201d Zane asked quietly. \u201cHot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty answered immediately. He didn\u2019t even try to make up a lie or deny that he was sick.</p><p>Zane lifted one hand to touch the backs of his fingers to Ty\u2019s forehead and then his cheek. Ty closed his eyes with the contact. Shaking his head slightly, Zane glanced to Deuce. There was worry shining clearly in his dark brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get going,\u201d Deuce said needlessly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you up,\u201d Zane said to Ty, climbing to his knees and sliding his arm around Ty\u2019s back so he could help him stand. Ty wrapped his arm over Zane\u2019s shoulders and didn\u2019t even bother trying to hide that he couldn\u2019t have gotten up on his own.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Deuce muttered under his breath as he watched. He saw Zane\u2019s face slide into an immobile mask with flat, emotionless eyes as he took Ty\u2019s weight onto himself. Deuce wondered for a moment about an ability like that, to so completely suppress and hide emotion. It wasn\u2019t at all healthy. A groan from Ty drew his attention again. \u201cYou going to be able to go?\u201d Deuce asked him in a low voice. Earl was already up and gathering their equipment.</p><p>Ty merely nodded jerkily and looked up, letting his arm slide away from Zane\u2019s shoulders. His fingers dragged slowly across the back of Zane\u2019s neck, as if he didn\u2019t want to forget what the contact felt like. Deuce felt a pang of anger and sadness as he watched them. As sick as Ty was, the two of them were still careful of showing too much intimacy for fear of how Earl would react to it. Deuce swallowed against a knot in his throat and gritted his teeth.</p> <p>Zane reluctantly let Ty go, but he only took one step back as he watched Ty waver slightly. Ty closed his eyes and swallowed hard, steadying himself before he nodded to them both. Deuce knew his brother was in bad shape just by the fact that he didn\u2019t seem to be ashamed of needing help to stand.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Earl asked gruffly as he stood on the other side of the fire pit watching them.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Deuce and Ty muttered in unison. Zane just gave him a nod as he hefted the backpack awkwardly.</p><p>Once they crested the ridge they\u2019d decided not to attempt the night before, the trail was too precarious to go anything but single-file. Deuce limped heavily as he kept pace with Ty, who trudged in front of him. Their father was taking point, but he kept having to stop and turn to wait for them as they lagged behind his pace.</p><p>Deuce wasn\u2019t really surprised when Ty finally came to a slow, almost rambling stop a couple hours later and merely fell to his knees without further warning. Still, it scared the hell out of him when he saw it. The fear and adrenaline overwhelmed any other emotion as Deuce clambered to get to him. Zane, bringing up the rear, almost barreled over him trying to do the same.</p><p>Ty was on his knees, eyes closed and breaths coming in harsh, pained gasps. He supported himself with just the one hand. He was sweating profusely even though he was shivering violently, his cheeks flushed with fever, and his eyes were glazed and distant, almost gray in color as he stared at the ground. Deuce reached for him, preparing to help him up.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Earl barked suddenly as he went down on one knee in front of Ty. He didn\u2019t touch him; he merely ducked his head and met his son\u2019s eyes, forcing Ty to look up at him. \u201cGet up, Marine,\u201d he ordered, his voice stern and angry.</p><p>Deuce saw Zane bristle visibly, but Deuce put a hand out to calm the man as Ty\u2019s shoulders snapped backward and he raised his head. Deuce couldn\u2019t see an ounce of recognition in his brother\u2019s eyes as he looked at Earl.</p> <p>\u201cDad,\u201d Deuce said uncertainly, reaching out again.</p><p>\u201cGet on your feet, Marine!\u201d Earl growled angrily, batting Deuce\u2019s hand away before he could touch Ty and getting right in Ty\u2019s face.</p><p>Ty\u2019s chest was heaving as if he might be about to hyperventilate, but as Zane stepped forward to intercede, Ty lowered his head determinedly and pushed himself unsteadily to his feet again. Zane backed away and watched apprehensively, and Deuce stared at his father and brother in awe. The appeal to something ingrained deeper in his brother appeared to be what Ty needed. From one Marine to another. It was probably the only thing that would have kept Ty going, and Deuce wondered how Earl had known.</p><p>\u201cYou keep your feet, Staff Sergeant,\u201d Earl told Ty, pointing to the ground.</p><p>\u201cYes, Gunny,\u201d Ty managed to say in response, his voice a rough and tortured whisper.</p><p>Earl nodded curtly before turning and heading back down the narrow path. Deuce glanced from Ty to Zane, who looked just as unhappy as before, but that anger he\u2019d held in his rigid shoulders was gone. He must have figured out what Earl was doing too and realized it was working better than anything they could have done. Deuce placed a calming hand on Zane\u2019s arm. Earl\u2019s words had gotten Ty to his feet. That was what mattered for now.</p><p>TY\u2019S entire body was on fire. It felt like a sunburn that emanated from his fingers and burned out of control wherever clothing touched him. He burned, but he was so cold he had to clutch his heavy coat around him to keep his teeth from chattering, and even then he was shaking and shivering uncontrollably. The rational portion of his mind, the one that was trying to figure out how to survive, told him that the shivering was a waste of his energy. But then, so was walking. And breathing.</p><p>He distantly recognized that it wasn\u2019t the cool wind that made him shiver. He was going into septic shock. It had happened much faster than he\u2019d realized it would, but a part of his addled mind told him that the exertion of trying to get off the mountain was sending the poisoned blood racing through his body faster than it would have if he\u2019d been lying in a bed being given sponge baths by a pretty little nurse in white Crocs.</p><p>He concentrated on the footfalls of the man in front of him. He thought it might be his father, but if he was wrong he risked calling the Gunny \u201cDad,\u201d so he just kept his mouth shut and tried not to fall.</p><p>Keep your feet. Keep his feet, they\u2019d told him. It was shameful, not being able to keep his feet in front of the others because he\u2019d been bitten by a kitty cat.</p><p>Keep your feet, Meow Mix.</p><p>If he fell, no one could carry him. Sanchez and O\u2019Flaherty would drag him out, but... no. No, they weren\u2019t here. Elias Sanchez was dead, shot over a year ago in New York City by a serial killer Zane Garrett had later killed. And Nick O\u2019Flaherty was a cop in Boston, discharged just like Ty had been, thrown into the real world to make his own way. This wasn\u2019t a Recon mission. He had to keep his wits about him. He had to grasp at a thread of reality and hold onto it.</p><p>Zane Garrett. Zane was reality. Zane was here, and he was clear enough for Ty to hold onto. Zane appeared at his side from time to time as they walked, taking his arm as they went over particularly rough terrain, but then he would move away again. Still, Ty could grasp at that thread and hold it.</p><p>Ty\u2019s steps finally slowed, faltered. He stopped walking and closed his eyes, his head pounding. He wavered as a rush of noise assaulted his ears, and heat swept through him in sickening pulses. When he opened his eyes again, the edges of his vision were dark and sparkling.</p><p>His father turned around and looked at him, the man\u2019s steel gray eyes hard and disapproving when he realized Ty had stopped moving. \u201cYou keep walking, Marine,\u201d Earl said to him.</p><p>Ty\u2019s entire body trembled, and the waves of heat kept coming, but he swallowed hard and nodded obediently. He took another agonizing step, and his knee gave out. He sank to the ground against his will, his knees and his one good hand hitting the rocky ground hard as he tried to catch himself.</p><p>He tried to push himself up and failed.</p><p>\u201cTy!\u201d Earl cried in alarm as he darted toward him. He no longer looked stern or angry, just as worried and scared as any father about to lose his son.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Ty managed as he tried to push himself back to his feet yet again. He lost his balance on the slight rise of the embankment, toppling over as his father caught him. He rolled to his back, knowing with a certainty that came with encroaching death that he would not be getting back up under his own power.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming for us,\u201d Earl assured him as he pulled Ty into his arms and sank slowly to the ground along with him. \u201cI can hear \u2019em now, boy, just stay with us.\u201d</p><p>In the floating distance, he could hear shouts, but Ty found that he couldn\u2019t move. He fought to stay conscious. Shame washed through him, just as painful as the fever that ravished him. He had failed spectacularly in front of the only person he\u2019d ever wanted to make proud of him. But even that shame wasn\u2019t powerful enough now to get him to his feet.</p><p>\u201cStay with us, son,\u201d Earl murmured into his ear pleadingly. \u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrady, don\u2019t you fucking dare give up after I dug you out of that basement,\u201d Zane growled from somewhere close. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give up then, and you won\u2019t give up now.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes fluttered open, searching for Zane\u2019s eyes. Above him, the sky was a startling blue. The scrub pine was a bright, almost neon green, and the few trees in view boasted brilliant leaves of orange and yellow and red. Ty had never seen such colors in his life. It was beautiful. The faces looking down on him looked like airbrushed photos, taken and perfected and stylized until the colors were stark contrasts of highlights and lowlights, making them look ethereal.</p><p>He met Zane\u2019s dark eyes, the eyes he\u2019d been searching for. \u201cZane,\u201d he managed to gasp. He tried to think of something to say, an apology for dragging the man up here and thanks for all he\u2019d done. I love you. But nothing came to his lips. He just closed his eyes, seeing Zane\u2019s face imprinted in the darkness. He held to the material of Earl\u2019s coat, trying to keep himself from spinning and swaying on the ground. \u201cMountain\u2019s moving,\u201d he told them all in alarm, the words slurred horribly.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane barked, his voice a mixture of anger and desperation. \u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d he ordered. \u201cGet up!\u201d</p><p>Ty did open his eyes, but when he tried to sit up, his limbs wouldn\u2019t cooperate. He put every ounce of his energy and will into getting off the ground, but he realized with a sinking sensation that he hadn\u2019t even managed to lift his head.</p><p>\u201cGet up, Beaumont, it ain\u2019t your time yet!\u201d Earl called to him, sounding far away and gauzy.</p><p>He was dying. After all the things he\u2019d been through that could and probably should have killed him, he had to go and get attacked by a goddamn mountain lion. Someone somewhere was going to find that funny.</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes focused on the impossibly blue sky overhead as he felt himself slipping away, and the pain faded too. He idly thought that angel wings sounded a whole lot like the rotors of a chopper, and he\u2019d really have liked the chance to tell Zane that.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>ZANE reflected on the past painful twelve hours as he walked tiredly down the long, door-lined hall. Mara Grady, with an assist from Chester, had lit a fire under the local search-and-rescue people as soon as they hadn\u2019t shown up on the day they\u2019d planned\u2014she\u2019d actually mentioned a bad feeling; Zane was pitifully glad that she hadn\u2019t ignored it\u2014and several rangers with dogs had found them on the mountain just as Ty collapsed. A rescue helicopter had been in their wake, and Ty had been airlifted off the mountain to this hospital in Charleston.</p><p>He\u2019d barely made it.</p><p>The doctors assured Earl and Mara that Ty was now out of danger. He\u2019d woken once so far to be told what had happened, only to immediately fall back into unconsciousness.</p><p>Zane turned the corner at the end of the hall and slowed as he saw Earl outside the door to Ty\u2019s hospital room. To Zane\u2019s eyes and satisfaction, Earl Grady seemed to be agonizing over the state of his son. The elder Grady stood with his arms crossed and his head down as he rubbed at his newly shaved chin and frowned, looking into the room where his son slept. He hadn\u2019t gone too far from the room, but he hadn\u2019t gone inside much, either. It was like he couldn\u2019t make up his mind. As far as Zane was concerned, he could stay outside. He wasn\u2019t feeling too charitable toward Earl Grady. If the man hadn\u2019t gone overboard insulting Ty\u2014and fuck, Earl couldn\u2019t have thought of a worse thing to call Ty than a coward\u2014then his son, Zane\u2019s partner, wouldn\u2019t be lying practically dead in this goddamn hospital. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even though it had been Earl\u2019s unusual methods that kept Ty walking much longer than he should have been able, Ty\u2019s father had still been seriously out of line. Zane would never wish him real harm, but he seriously hoped the man understood and regretted what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Zane asked as he stopped next to the older man, meaning it in general terms.</p><p>Earl turned his head slightly and gave him a weak smile and a nod. He turned back to look into the room, covering his mouth with his hand and sighing. Ty was asleep in the bed, hooked up to several IVs and his color looking better than he had even an hour before. Deuce sprawled in a chair beside the bed, snoring softly. Zane had just walked Mara downstairs to the truck; she was heading home with Chester to pack them all some clean clothes and would return in a couple hours.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know why Ty joined the FBI?\u201d Earl asked Zane abruptly.</p><p>Zane shrugged as he leaned against the doorframe. He had lots of little pieces to Ty\u2019s puzzle: the \u201cofficial\u201d story of why he\u2019d left the Marines, which was complete bullshit according to Ty; that his last partner had been killed in the line of duty, even though Ty had tried to take the bullet for him; that he\u2019d known Dick Burns since he was in diapers.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Zane answered.</p><p>Earl glanced at him and smiled sadly. \u201cHe joined the FBI \u2019cause his daddy\u2019s best friend asked him to,\u201d he told Zane softly, looking back into the room to make certain Ty and Deuce were both still asleep.</p><p>Burns. Zane didn\u2019t comment; if Earl needed to spill his guts, he could do it. But Zane was the wrong person to be looking to for any sort of absolution. He didn\u2019t forgive and forget easily, not when he could still see the pain in Ty\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>Earl nodded in response to his silence, his eyes still on his sons. \u201cRichard was paying me a visit one weekend a while back, and he was talking about work,\u201d he told Zane. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like what he was doing. Said he didn\u2019t trust any of the agents he was working with to get the job done. I remember sitting there and him looking at me with defeat on his face. He was talking about early retirement. He said to me, \u2018Earl, if I had just one good man I could count on, I could get a lot of good done\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Earl swallowed heavily, cocked his head, and then turned and met Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cI told him where to find Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that like you think it was a mistake,\u201d Zane observed, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t give Ty much choice, me sending Richard to him,\u201d Earl answered flatly.</p><p>\u201cNo. It didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Earl nodded again, as if knowing he deserved the harsh words. \u201cRichard and I never gave a thought to what he wanted or to how dangerous it was,\u201d he said, the words quiet and solemn. \u201cWe just... we just thought Ty could handle it and carried on from there. And Ty... he\u2019d do anything to meet what he felt like were our expectations,\u201d he told Zane as he lowered his head in apparent shame and turned away from the door, beginning to walk slowly down the hall. \u201cEven when he was a young\u2019un, he never made an excuse not to follow me into those mines. He was scared to death of \u2019em,\u201d he told Zane with a tremble in his voice. Zane realized the older man was on the verge of tearing up. \u201cI almost lost him today,\u201d he said, almost to himself. He gave a soft snort and shook his head. \u201cA damn wildcat,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>\u201cI guess he figured he\u2019d done everything spectacular already,\u201d Zane said, looking over his shoulder to glance inside the room. He didn\u2019t have to study Earl to know the man was worried. He was worried, himself. Zane frowned. As angry as he was, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to be cold and cruel to a father so obviously torn up over mistakes he\u2019d made with his son.</p><p>How many harsh words had Zane himself said to Ty to light a fire under the man? Anyone who knew him knew that the best way to make Ty dangerous was to make him angry. It made him a useful weapon.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Zane finally settled on. He didn\u2019t want to think about the alternative. He wondered if this was how Ty had felt when it had been him three-quarters dead in a hospital bed. Right now he felt helpless. He was hurting. He was scared that he might have lost something he wasn\u2019t even sure he\u2019d had, and there hadn\u2019t been a damn thing he could\u2019ve done about it. \u201cHe\u2019s strong,\u201d he said to Earl confidently.</p><p>Earl stopped with his back to Zane, and he looked up at the ceiling of the hallway. \u201cI know he is,\u201d he responded with a hint of pride in his voice. \u201cBut he thinks that\u2019s enough,\u201d he said as he turned and met Zane\u2019s eyes again. \u201cI\u2019m relieved to see he has a good man with him,\u201d he told Zane solemnly. \u201cSomeone to watch his back.\u201d</p><p>Zane flinched in surprise. That wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d have expected to hear from Earl Grady.</p><p>Earl nodded as he observed Zane\u2019s reaction. \u201cI don\u2019t just say pretty words to hear myself talk, son,\u201d he informed him. \u201cI mean it. Thank you for....\u201d He was forced to look away and swallow hard as his voice faltered. He pressed his lips together tightly as he fought to regain control.</p><p>It was clear, seeing Earl\u2019s emotions bubble to the surface, that Earl was being truthful. It gave Zane an odd, bittersweet feeling of vindication. He\u2019d proved himself to Earl Grady\u2014but Ty had been seriously wounded in the process. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said quietly, watching the older man, wondering if Earl planned to apologize to Ty as well. \u201cYou might keep that in mind the next time you talk with Ty.\u201d</p><p>Earl looked back at him and lifted his chin, obviously still fighting back his emotions. \u201cKeep what in mind, son?\u201d he asked, managing to make his voice even once more.</p> <p>\u201cYou owe him a hell of a lot more than just pretty words.\u201d Zane paused, his banked anger melting into a quiet, pained sadness. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you thought you were doing, but you couldn\u2019t have said anything that would have hurt him more.\u201d</p><p>Earl was silent as he took a few steps toward the doorway and stared into Ty\u2019s room. The guilt and worry were clear on his face, written in the lines around his eyes and mouth. \u201cI know,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to apologize enough. I\u2019ll never be able to make that up to him. But never for one second have I thought my son was anything but what he is.\u201d</p><p>Zane was silent. There was a big difference between thought and deed, and what Earl had said up on that mountain was unforgivable. Earl sighed heavily and nodded in agreement as if he\u2019d heard Zane\u2019s last thought loud and clear.</p><p>Deuce came shuffling out of the room, rubbing his eyes and yawning, and Zane wondered if he\u2019d heard any of his conversation with Earl.</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Earl asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cTalking in his sleep,\u201d Deuce answered in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he saying?\u201d Earl asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Deuce answered with a shrug as he looked at Zane and gave him a small smile. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s even English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight be Farsi,\u201d Zane murmured.</p><p>\u201cCould be,\u201d Deuce responded with a closer look at Zane, as if he hadn\u2019t expected Zane to know Ty spoke Farsi. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s just slurred cursing.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cYou going to sit with him?\u201d he asked Earl as he stepped back to give Deuce room to get through the door.</p><p>Earl\u2019s expression became more guarded, and he looked back into the room where his son lay muttering to himself. He shook his head in answer. \u201cNot just yet. I\u2019m gonna go hunt down some coffee,\u201d he said gruffly, and then he turned away and headed down the hallway, walking with his shoulders squared and tense.</p><p>Zane turned his eyes to Deuce. \u201cHe needs someone to talk to,\u201d he said with a sigh before rubbing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d Deuce responded wryly. \u201cI\u2019m a fucking psychiatrist, and he won\u2019t talk to me,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>A short laugh got out before Zane could stop it. \u201cDeuce, you know we love you. But we hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Deuce muttered as he turned around and looked back into Ty\u2019s room. \u201cThe whole family likes to screw with other people\u2019s heads. I\u2019m just the only one who took it pro. But,\u201d he added with a slightly darker undertone as he looked at his brother, \u201cDad can sit and stew over this one for all I care.\u201d He turned his head and peered at Zane. \u201cWhat\u2019d he say to you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Zane took the opportunity to move into Ty\u2019s sterile-looking, sparsely decorated room as he considered how to answer. He didn\u2019t want to get into a mini-showdown with Deuce, even though it sounded as if Deuce was just as angry at Earl as Zane was. The only person who didn\u2019t seem to be seething over what had been said was Ty. Still, Zane didn\u2019t want to insult their father and make Deuce feel the need to defend him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s worried about Ty,\u201d he answered as neutrally as possible. \u201cAbout this and maybe his mental state in general. He was talking about why Ty joined the Bureau.\u201d</p><p>Deuce looked at him closely, then sighed and shook his head. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard that one before,\u201d he muttered dejectedly. \u201cDick\u2019s little side jobs,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cTy\u2019s told me he\u2019s afraid one day we\u2019ll get word he was killed in a car wreck or something equally innocuous because he was on some secret mission they can\u2019t make public.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at Deuce, frowning hard. He had no idea what the man was talking about. He\u2019d never heard about any secret missions or side jobs, although he supposed that might have been what Ty was doing when they were separated after the Tri-State case and Zane had been unable to track him down. He himself had been thrown back undercover, after all. With Ty being so close to the Assistant Director, there was no telling what sort of work he was trusted to undertake.</p><p>\u201cThe thing that always made Ty so good at everything he did was that he had no fear. Makes Ma and Dad sick with worry,\u201d Deuce continued with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of things just like we are,\u201d Zane said as he turned his eyes on his restless partner. \u201cHe just hides it well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Deuce asked in what sounded like honest surprise. Whether it was surprise that Zane knew that or surprise that his brother was afraid of things, Zane didn\u2019t know. \u201cLike what?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t look away from Ty as he resisted the urge to touch him, just his arm, his shoulder, something to reassure himself that Ty really was there and breathing. \u201cThe mines, for one,\u201d he answered. \u201cSeems reasonable to me. Small, dark spaces to get trapped in.\u201d</p><p>Deuce watched Zane as he sat down beside the bed again. \u201cHe tell you that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane glanced up as he slid his hands in his pockets. It was easier to keep them to himself that way. \u201cI made the mistake of waking him up once, when he was doing this.\u201d He nodded down to Ty\u2019s active sleeping. \u201cFigured it was a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade the mistake,\u201d Deuce echoed. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Zane finally looked over at Deuce. \u201cOh, he didn\u2019t hit me or anything before he woke up,\u201d he said as the corner of his mouth turned up. \u201cBut he sure was cranky once I got his attention.\u201d His eyes slid back to Ty. It had to be the IV keeping him under now, he thought clinically. Ty usually woke up in a snap if he sensed someone close. That, or he wasn\u2019t getting better, and that didn\u2019t bear thinking about at all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you just got cranky instead of hit,\u201d Deuce told him fondly.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane agreed. \u201cAfter he woke up, we had a talk about things we were afraid of. How we might die. Heights. Small places with bugs,\u201d he listed off.</p><p>Deuce smiled and nodded. He looked back down at Ty, but the smile fell as he watched his brother toss and turn. \u201cTy has a lot of bad dreams,\u201d he said to Zane, his voice sad.</p><p>Zane wondered what Deuce expected him to say about that. Of course, the man had no idea that Zane was living with the same problem. \u201cThat\u2019s why he keeps quiet, you know.\u201d</p><p>Deuce looked up at him, still frowning. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t have bad dreams. So your mom and dad don\u2019t have bad dreams.\u201d</p><p>Deuce looked at him for a long time before the corner of his mouth twitched into a smile. He nodded and returned his attention to Ty. \u201cYou know him better than you think you do,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cYou want something to drink?\u201d he asked as he pushed himself out of his chair.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Zane answered as he rolled his shoulders back and realized he still had his jacket on from his last cigarette break. He shrugged out of it and tossed it over the small rolling tray table that had been pushed to the side.</p><p>\u201cBack in a minute,\u201d Deuce said to him as he left, patting Ty\u2019s bare foot as he passed the end of the bed.</p><p>Ty groaned as the door to the room clicked when Deuce opened it, and his foot twitched where he\u2019d been touched. Zane shook his head. The last time they\u2019d been together in a hospital room, it had been him in the bed. He remembered it hazily because he\u2019d been so drugged. But he could still see the upset expression on Ty\u2019s face when he\u2019d announced that he had to leave while Zane had to stay. He remembered a short, gentle kiss. And he remembered the guilt on Ty\u2019s face when he\u2019d told Ty to go while he was too drugged to stop him.</p><p>Sighing, Zane paced around the bed and sat in the chair crammed between the bed and the window. As he sat down, the chair jarred the bed a little. Ty flailed under the thin hospital sheet, both arms and both feet coming off the bed like a baby who\u2019d been startled. His IV rattled, and the plastic side rails of the bed banged noisily as Ty gasped and tried to sit up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane leaned forward. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he cautioned. He reached to try to catch Ty\u2019s flailing arm and save the IV. \u201cIt\u2019s okay; you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>Ty hissed as the IV tugged, and he put his hand over the line and looked up at Zane accusingly. Rolling his eyes, Zane sat back. \u201cWelcome back to the land of the living.\u201d</p><p>Ty responded with a grunt as he looked down at the cast on his hand and the IV in his arm. He looked around at the room and then over at Zane with narrowed eyes. \u201cHungry,\u201d he muttered, his voice rough and hoarse. \u201cYou ate my lunch, huh?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it was yummy too,\u201d Zane drawled. He was relieved to find that Ty must have remembered the last time he woke when they\u2019d told him what had happened. Ty had not taken it well when he\u2019d been told the cast would have to stay on his hand for a minimum of three weeks, and Zane had been dreading the possibility of having to tell him again. There was a chipped bone in there somewhere, and the doctors wanted the entire hand immobilized just to keep any infections from spreading further as the antibiotics did their job.</p><p>Ty glared briefly before allowing a slow smile. His eyes drifted closed, and his shoulders slowly began to relax. \u201cHow long have I been asleep?\u201d he asked as he forced his eyes open again.</p><p>\u201cTwelve hours, give or take,\u201d Zane said as he leaned back in the chair. \u201cHow much better than roadkill do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Ty muttered. \u201cNever felt roadkill.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips quirked as he leaned forward and propped his elbows on his knees. \u201cDeuce is real torn up,\u201d he said seriously. He wasn\u2019t even going to mention Earl.</p> <p>Ty\u2019s chin jerked to the side, and he looked at Zane with wide eyes. \u201cWhy, what happened?\u201d he asked worriedly.</p><p>\u201cOver you, jackass.\u201d Zane bit back the rest of what he was about to say before shaking his head. \u201cIt was close. We almost didn\u2019t get you here in time.\u201d</p><p>A hurt look flashed through Ty\u2019s eyes before he looked away, concentrating on the hand that was resting in his lap instead. \u201cOh,\u201d he responded, abashed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, oh.\u201d Zane rubbed at his eyes again. He would have to sleep soon. He hadn\u2019t managed more than a few minutes stolen here and there since reaching the hospital, and he\u2019d never slept more than a couple hours at a time on the mountain. He was still too jumpy, even being so exhausted. All he wanted was Ty in a bed next to him and a week to do nothing. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the only one worried,\u201d he muttered, although he figured Ty wouldn\u2019t appreciate it.</p><p>Ty glanced at him and winced. \u201cWasn\u2019t exactly the relaxing vacation it was supposed to be,\u201d he agreed slowly as he began to poke at the plaster of his cast and pluck at the tufts of gauze sticking out of it.</p><p>Zane just had to chuckle. \u201cNo, it hasn\u2019t been. Christ.\u201d He shut his eyes and leaned back against the chair.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it would\u2019ve been,\u201d Ty insisted under his breath. He sniffed and looked around before asking, \u201cThey go home?\u201d He sounded forlorn.</p><p>\u201cNo. Deuce is getting us drinks. Mara\u2019s back home with Chester, but she\u2019s coming back soon. And Earl\u2019s taking a walk.\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed and closed his eyes, resting back into the bed. \u201cTaking a walk, huh?\u201d he asked, resigned.</p><p>\u201cWould you please look at me?\u201d Zane asked. Ty needed to understand how Earl was reacting to this mess. If he chose to keep lying to him after, that was his business. Ty forced his eyes open and turned his head to look over at Zane blearily. \u201cHe\u2019s not angry,\u201d Zane said. \u201cHe\u2019s upset about what happened up on that mountain and about what he said to you. All this hospital shit just put some lovely little icing swirls on that apple pie of your mom\u2019s. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him blankly for several beats before frowning. \u201cSomeone brought pie?\u201d he finally asked in confusion.</p><p>Zane stared at him passively for a long moment before standing up and walking around the bed. \u201cAll right, lay back down,\u201d he murmured, pulling the pillows back into a pile for Ty to lean against. \u201cI should\u2019ve remembered you\u2019re still drugged to the gills. And I forgot what you\u2019ve said about meds making you funny sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Ty made a noise of agreement and carefully turned onto his side, taking advantage of Zane\u2019s help to find a more comfortable position. \u201cThey don\u2019t make me funny,\u201d Ty argued. \u201cI\u2019m always funny,\u201d he told Zane as he fingered the IV line. Then he turned his face up to look at Zane. \u201cDo I get any of the pie?\u201d he asked earnestly as he reached up to pull out the oxygen line that rested under his nose.</p><p>The rest of the irritation drained out of Zane as he calmly retrieved the line and replaced it. \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d he answered, straightening out the sheet so it wasn\u2019t bunched up around Ty\u2019s legs. When he was done, he reached out to rest the backs of his fingers against Ty\u2019s forehead.</p> <p>Ty\u2019s eyes fluttered closed at the contact, and he gave a heavy sigh. He didn\u2019t even try to pull out the oxygen line again. \u201cTell Dad I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he requested sleepily.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that right now,\u201d Zane chided gently as he rubbed along the beard Ty had grown. In his opinion, it was Earl that owed the apology. Only a real fool would call Ty a coward in any situation. Ty nodded, but it was obvious that he was already drifting off again. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Zane murmured, still petting. \u201cIt\u2019ll keep.\u201d</p><p>Behind him, someone cleared his throat softly to announce his presence, and when Zane turned, Deuce smiled slightly at him. \u201cGot you a Coke,\u201d he said as he held out a bottle. \u201cWas he awake?\u201d</p><p>Zane shuffled a little as he straightened, surprised that he\u2019d been caught off guard. But Ty had a way of holding all his attention. He accepted the bottle with a nod. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said, wondering what, if anything, Deuce might have seen.</p><p>Deuce twisted off the cap to his own bottle as he walked around the end of the bed, his head down and a small, worried smile on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s more than convenience, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked Zane as he sat down.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s more than convenience?\u201d Zane was deliberately obtuse as he opened his own bottle.</p><p>\u201cYou and my brother,\u201d Deuce answered bluntly.</p><p>\u201cAs partners, it\u2019s generally advisable that you at least tolerate each other most of the time,\u201d Zane spun out. \u201cSometimes it takes more effort than others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not as good at evading a question as he is,\u201d Deuce advised with a nod at Ty. \u201cHe knows there\u2019s no pie,\u201d he told Zane with a small smile.</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d Zane asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Deuce shrugged and leaned forward to put a hand gently on Ty\u2019s shoulder. Ty twitched with the contact and muttered something unintelligible. Deuce pursed his lips and looked back up at Zane. \u201cHe knew the drugs would get him soon. He was just stalling until he fell back asleep. He\u2019ll never talk about dad to anyone. Never has, never will.\u201d He leaned back and threw his feet up onto the edge of the bed. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to put you in a tight spot,\u201d he assured Zane quietly, reverting back to their other discussion. \u201cI\u2019ve just never met anyone he was serious about,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Zane forced himself not to react, to just take a drink. Serious. Then he let himself look at Deuce. \u201cAnd you think you have now?\u201d</p><p>Deuce shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cWhen I say never, Zane, I mean it. I\u2019ve known him all my life. He never had a junior high crush. He never had a high school sweetheart. Even when he was in service and going through college, there was no one he was even remotely hung up on. There was always something more important to him than being in a relationship. The Corps. His Bronco. Football. His favorite Crayola sleeping bag,\u201d he said with a hint of a smile. \u201cI like you, man. I think you must be good for him. But just remember what I\u2019m telling you before you start thinking too hard. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d even know what to do with himself if he loved someone.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s heart tried to pound harder, and he took a slow, steady breath, reminding himself that Deuce\u2019s comment about love didn\u2019t apply to him. He still had to swallow hard. \u201cI know what\u2019s important to him,\u201d he finally settled on. \u201cAnd his partner\u2019s not at the top of the list.\u201d He actually gave Deuce an honest, though wry, smile.</p><p>Deuce returned it with a sad one of his own and looked down at his brother once more. He waited for a moment before glancing back up at Zane. \u201cI would argue differently,\u201d he stated finally. \u201cJust don\u2019t let Dad find out,\u201d he advised in a near whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Zane muttered, turning his gaze back to Ty, who was tossing fitfully again. Zane thought his own stomach was tossing just as badly now as he looked at his partner. At his lover.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that a lot,\u201d Deuce replied with a long-suffering sigh before taking a drink from his bottle of Mountain Dew.</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s no way I\u2019d willingly talk to a shrink about my partner,\u201d Zane added, still not looking at Deuce as his hand crunched the plastic Coke bottle a little.</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d Deuce agreed amiably. \u201cNot that you have anything you need to get off your chest, anyway, am I right?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot a thing. All is right in the world,\u201d Zane continued, making himself ignore the tightness in his chest and focus on what he and Ty did best. \u201cAnd Ty and I might just get through two days without a fight. Now, I said \u2018might\u2019, mind you.\u201d He looked at his watch. \u201cTwo hours to go. It\u2019ll be a new record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fight a lot, then?\u201d Deuce asked in a casual tone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an understatement,\u201d Zane groused before taking another swallow of his drink.</p><p>\u201cIs this on-the-job fighting or after hours?\u201d Deuce inquired curiously.</p><p>\u201cI have yet to determine that there is any difference.\u201d Zane paused. \u201cAny appreciable difference,\u201d he corrected himself, thinking about how they got along at the office as opposed to in the bed in his hotel suite.</p><p>\u201cI gather it\u2019s not unresolved sexual tension,\u201d Deuce observed. \u201cCould it be, deep down, maybe you enjoy the fighting?\u201d he suggested in an offhand manner.</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s not deep down. We really do enjoy... fighting.\u201d He made himself take another drink to stop the smile, his eyes still focused on Ty. God, he wished Ty would wake up and argue with him right now. It would go a long way toward reassuring him that Ty was going to be okay. He could really go for a good fight, one where they yelled about something stupid and pushed each other around and ended up fucking each other silly and then holding each other all night after. He remembered their quiet talk in front of the fire in the trail cabin, where he\u2019d deliberately told Ty something about himself that he knew full well Ty would take advantage of. More ammunition.</p><p>\u201cSo your observation that you may go forty-eight hours without a fight is actually one of disappointment,\u201d Deuce surmised clinically. \u201cThe way you express your appreciation of each other is through insults and barbs. Once you start being nice to each other, it signifies an ebb in interest,\u201d he pointed out with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re never nice to each oth\u2014\u201d Zane cut himself off and twitched. He couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from Ty, even knowing Deuce was watching, and Zane knew right then and there that he wouldn\u2019t be giving Ty up without a fight. Ever. He squeezed his eyes shut for a moment before turning a glare on Deuce.</p><p>Deuce merely raised one eyebrow and smiled in return. \u201cAnd how does that make you feel, Special Agent Garrett?\u201d he asked in a slow drawl.</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes, reached out, and popped Deuce on the back of the head, just like his mom did. \u201cAsshole,\u201d he muttered as he tried to suppress the panic threatening at the edge of his awareness.</p><p>Deuce laughed softly and twisted the cap back onto his bottle. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said smugly.</p><p>\u201cYou better hope he\u2019s really asleep,\u201d Zane threatened.</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t want him knowing how you feel about him?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>Zane\u2019s shoulders tightened. \u201cHe knows enough. Why else would we fight all the time?\u201d</p><p>Deuce examined him for a long while before turning his eyes back to his sleeping brother. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. Has he already started being nice to you?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cWe have our moments,\u201d Zane allowed reluctantly, knowing he was contradicting himself.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just him being a decent human being or if it\u2019s that he\u2019s lost interest in trying to goad you on,\u201d Deuce supplied softly.</p><p>Tipping his head sideways, Zane met Deuce\u2019s eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re partners. We don\u2019t have to be at each other\u2019s throats all the time,\u201d he said with a slight shrug.</p><p>Deuce sat with his feet still propped on the bed and his arm resting on the side of the chair. He ran his finger back and forth across his lower lip as he watched Zane. \u201cTy has a protective streak a mile wide,\u201d he finally said. \u201cHe always has. He takes a lot on himself. He doesn\u2019t like to be leaned on because he\u2019s terrified of letting people down. So being charged with protecting something, especially if it\u2019s a job he\u2019s not sure he can do, it\u2019s something that weighs heavy on him. So when he has a choice, he only protects the things he holds close to his heart,\u201d Deuce continued, giving his chest a pat.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for you to figure out, Zane,\u201d Deuce answered with a shrug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane didn\u2019t have anything else to say. He was pretty sure Ty cared about him, just as he cared about Ty. They were partners. They watched out for one another. They depended on each other. Only Zane was finding himself more and more attached to Ty\u2014and that was something that scared him.</p><p>Deuce sat silently as Zane mulled it over, the hiss of his bottle cap as he twisted it off the only sound he made. \u201cI\u2019ll send Ty the bill,\u201d he finally said with a small smile.</p><p>Chapter 17</p> <p>\u201cSHOULD he be traveling as sick as he is?\u201d Mara Grady asked worriedly as she fussed back and forth between Ty and the pies she was preparing in the kitchen. \u201cMaybe he should stay here until he\u2019s feeling better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling better, Ma,\u201d Ty called out from where he sat on the couch, covered in blankets and holding a mug of hot chocolate his mother had shoved into his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou are not,\u201d she insisted from the kitchen as she banged a pie plate onto the counter and began rattling utensils and plates.</p><p>\u201cGod hates me,\u201d Ty muttered from under one of the heavy quilts she had draped over him.</p><p>Zane snorted from where he was sprawled in a rocking chair across from the couch, under an afghan of his own. Mara had taken to mothering him too. \u201cIf God hated you that cat would have bitten you somewhere more sensitive,\u201d he said, teasing.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, wait \u2019til the drugs wear off and I can tell which one of you is real,\u201d Ty grumbled at him. He sniffed at the air as the smell of apple pie began to waft to them.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you have to go?\u201d Mara called.</p><p>\u201cLeave the boy alone,\u201d Earl told her from his seat in the kitchen, and their voices dropped as they continued talking quietly to each other. Ty sat and scowled at Zane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019ll freeze that way, but you might like it to,\u201d Zane murmured as he rocked, the chair squeaking a little.</p><p>\u201cWhen are we leaving?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Zane was quiet for a long moment as he watched Ty. \u201cI\u2019m leaving tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Ty inclined his head and frowned harder. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me here,\u201d he whispered harshly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you need to rest and heal up instead of driving all the way back to Baltimore?\u201d Zane asked. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a hell of a lot easier for you to fly home. It\u2019s only a short drive to the airport in Charleston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should be baking pies or something?\u201d Ty responded gruffly.</p><p>\u201cI bet you already know how,\u201d Zane said. \u201cDeliverance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that have to do with pie?\u201d Ty asked in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cJust a comment about your wide and varied skills.\u201d Zane paused. \u201cOf which healing seems to need some practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heal just fine,\u201d Ty argued. \u201cAnd you\u2019re one to talk,\u201d he added, pointing at the colorful bruise that stretched from his very black eye along the full line of Zane\u2019s cheekbone, which was apparently so painful that Zane hadn\u2019t shaved his beard off yet. Zane wrinkled his nose and winced.</p><p>\u201cYou boys want more hot chocolate?\u201d Mara called out as Deuce came thumping into the living room and threw himself onto the couch beside Ty.</p> <p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d Ty and Deuce both called out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, thanks,\u201d Zane answered as he gave Ty a disbelieving look.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked him defensively.</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is, you have a chance to kick back and relax, have someone take care of you. Maybe you should take advantage of it.\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked at Zane slowly and pushed the quilt off his head as he leaned forward. \u201cDo I look relaxed to you?\u201d he asked in a low voice.</p><p>Beside him, Deuce began to chuckle softly. Zane raised an eyebrow, still rocking gently. Ty began to struggle with the heavy quilt, trying to get out from under it. Deuce moved beside him, pulling the edge of the quilt out from under himself in an attempt to help, and Ty growled as the throbbing in his hand got worse and worse.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d Mara asked as she came into the living room with a tray of more hot chocolate and set it on the coffee table. \u201cStop your fussing,\u201d she ordered as she swatted Deuce away and recovered Ty with the quilt he\u2019d just managed to get off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me, Ma,\u201d Ty protested as he began struggling with the quilt again, fighting against the cumbersome cast on his hand. \u201cKilling me,\u201d he muttered with emphasis as she tutted and headed back to the kitchen.</p><p>Zane watched the circus with a slight smile, looking back and forth between Ty and Deuce.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Ty told him in a growl.</p><p>Deuce began to laugh softly. \u201cShe just misses you,\u201d he offered. \u201cLet her baby you some. She\u2019ll let up,\u201d he advised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be more tempted to listen to you if you weren\u2019t snickering gleefully while you said it,\u201d Ty told him. \u201cGarrett, when are we leaving?\u201d he asked Zane stubbornly as he gave up the fight against the quilt and started trying to go the other way instead, lifting it up over his head.</p><p>\u201cYour family wants to spend some time with you,\u201d Zane reminded him gently. \u201cWithout someone around to remind you about work, I\u2019d guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see them any time,\u201d Ty countered.</p><p>Deuce cleared his throat pointedly, and Ty growled at him as he finally extricated himself from the quilt and tossed it on the floor triumphantly. Zane was shaking his head slightly, the look on his face pretty much classing that answer as bullshit. Deuce was looking at him in much the same manner.</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes at both of them and sighed. He sat silently for a moment, trying to ignore them and the intense throbbing in his hand. Finally, he looked around the room and pursed his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda cold in here, huh?\u201d he muttered as he leaned forward and retrieved the quilt to wrap up in it again.</p><p>\u201cZane\u2019ll take care of your Bronco. If you don\u2019t want to fly, I\u2019ll drive you home at the end of the week,\u201d Deuce offered.</p><p>\u201cAnd I promise I\u2019ll take care of your Bronco,\u201d Zane repeated.</p><p>Ty sighed and glanced sideways at his brother. He couldn\u2019t honestly say he wanted to go anywhere but to bed. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d Deuce told him as he leaned forward and picked up a mug of hot chocolate. \u201cI\u2019m not a couples counselor,\u201d he reminded.</p><p>Ty jerked in surprise, but he recovered quickly and jabbed at his brother in retaliation, causing him to spill the hot liquid in his mug all over his lap.</p><p>Zane chuckled at their antics. Without warning, he shifted and stood. \u201cI\u2019m going to see if I can sleep until dinner,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI can\u2019t drive home like this.\u201d And he started toward the stairs.</p><p>Deuce was standing and patting gingerly at the fronts of his thighs, and Ty watched Zane go as he hid himself behind the quilt. When Zane\u2019s feet disappeared up the steps, Deuce turned and swatted at Ty, gesturing that he should follow.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked defensively.</p><p>\u201cGo talk to him,\u201d Deuce ordered in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou go talk to him,\u201d Ty hissed.</p><p>\u201cGo talk to him, and I\u2019ll keep Ma and Dad off your back while you\u2019re here,\u201d Deuce bargained.</p><p>Ty glowered at him, but after a moment he sighed and stood, tossing the quilt aside. \u201cWhat do I talk to him about?\u201d he asked uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cFigure it out,\u201d Deuce answered as he shoved his mug into Ty\u2019s hands and headed for the kitchen to get a towel.</p><p>Ty looked down at the marshmallows that swirled in the mug and then up at the stairs with a deep sigh. He set the mug on the table and headed for the stairs unsteadily, trudging up to his old room in search of his partner.</p><p>He knocked softly on the door before pushing it open slightly. Not only had Zane left the door unlocked, but he was lying on the bed, on his side, with his back to the door. Ty stood in the doorway for a long moment, frowning. It was unusual behavior from his very paranoid partner. Maybe that meant he felt safe here. That thought actually made Ty smile. \u201cYou want to tell me why I owe my brother five hundred dollars?\u201d he asked finally as he began moving into the room. Zane didn\u2019t even twitch, his cheek pushed against the pillow as he lay totally still. Ty sat on the edge of the bed next to him. \u201cDid it help?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cDid what help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking with him,\u201d Ty answered as he leaned to one side, trying to see Zane\u2019s face.</p><p>Another long pause, and Zane\u2019s shoulder moved slightly. \u201cMore than I\u2019d rather admit,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou think it might help to talk to him again?\u201d Ty asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cCan your wallet handle such abuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it would help.\u201d</p><p>Zane finally moved, rolling toward Ty to look up at him. \u201cI think Deuce has the wrong idea about us.\u201d</p><p>Ty resisted the urge to ask for further details. If it had to do with whatever he\u2019d talked about with Deuce, then it needed to stay with Zane for now unless he wanted it out. Zane had to know that if he did decide to seek out help with Ty\u2019s brother, what they said was safe even from Ty.</p><p>He was also scared to ask what the right idea about them might be.</p><p>\u201cHe knows we\u2019re screwing around,\u201d Ty finally responded with a negligent shrug. It was the only thing he could think to say.</p><p>\u201cYou told him?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s smarter than I am,\u201d Ty argued.</p><p>\u201cClearly,\u201d Zane murmured. \u201cYou should listen to him sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I don\u2019t?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Zane studied him for a moment before shifting to lie on his back so he could look up at him, and he rubbed his eyes again. \u201cI\u2019m too tired to play word games right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing games,\u201d Ty assured him. \u201cLook, Garrett,\u201d he sighed as he turned and leaned over him. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather talk with Deuce than some random Bureau shrink?\u201d he asked, wincing inwardly as he waited for Zane\u2019s reaction.</p><p>Zane sighed, reached up to curl his hand over Ty\u2019s nape, and tugged down gently. Ty allowed it warily, not certain what to expect. When Ty was close enough, Zane kissed him gently for mere seconds and then released him.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty pressed his forehead to Zane\u2019s with a hint of relief. This was one step in the right direction, anyway. The sooner he got Zane back on track, the sooner they\u2019d be in the field again. He cocked his head, looking into Zane\u2019s exhausted eyes. He wanted to say more. He wanted to ask Zane what he\u2019d meant earlier when he\u2019d mentioned \u201cthem\u201d as if they were a unit. But he supposed his father was right; he was too much of a coward to ask.</p><p>\u201cI can see your thoughts running in circles in your eyes,\u201d Zane said softly, his fingers ruffling in the hair at the base of Ty\u2019s neck.</p><p>Ty pulled back, his eyes darting back and forth as he looked into Zane\u2019s. He was too worn out to think of anything to say in return other than to ask, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking hard about something,\u201d Zane said. \u201cSomething you\u2019re not happy about. It shows. To me at least.\u201d He smiled, but it immediately faded. \u201cProbably because I\u2019ve seen it so much lately.\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed and shook his head. \u201cUsually I hide the thinking thing better,\u201d he tried in a wry voice.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide from me,\u201d Zane told him quietly. \u201cLord knows I\u2019ve probably seen you near your worst.\u201d</p><p>Ty gave that a small smile. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut I\u2019m not hiding from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you thinking about? Will you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Ty held his breath as he considered the request. It wasn\u2019t out of line. And Zane was right; he\u2019d seen Ty at his very worst. Any opinions he might form about Ty\u2019s weaknesses, either physical or mental, had long ago been formed.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about being afraid of things,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t say anything right away. He tipped his head slightly to one side as he studied Ty, and then he moved, scooting over on the bed and drawing Ty down to lay next to him. \u201cThings like dark rooms,\u201d he said softly. \u201cSmall spaces,\u201d he clarified. \u201cYou seemed to handle being out on the mountain in the dark okay.\u201d</p><p>Ty was already shaking his head in answer. \u201cDo you... do you think turning back up there would have been cowardice?\u201d he asked slowly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane answered immediately. \u201cYou heard me disagree with Earl from the start. We were four men of various capabilities, very lightly armed, in unknown territory with no resources and no idea who or what we were facing. We should have gotten to safety and sent back people who were equipped to handle it.\u201d His fingers clenched where they draped over Ty\u2019s hip. \u201cWe were lucky. Real damn lucky.\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t respond as he met Zane\u2019s eyes. Those were the same things he\u2019d been telling himself up until he\u2019d run into bigger things to worry about. But the hint of doubt lingered. He was too tired to try and conceal the emotion.</p><p>Zane lifted his hand and cupped Ty\u2019s cheek, turning Ty\u2019s chin so he couldn\u2019t look away. \u201cYou listen to me, Beaumont Tyler Grady. You are a wise-cracking, stubborn, annoying pain in the ass who lives to cause trouble. You\u2019re also a brave, courageous, and valiant Marine who puts his life on the line for what he believes and for those he loves. There is no way you have ever been or ever will be a coward. It simply isn\u2019t in you.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him in shock. It was the nicest thing Zane had ever said to him. Possibly the nicest thing anyone had ever said to him. He had no idea how to respond, and he realized his mouth was hanging open slightly as he tried to think of something to say. The corner of Zane\u2019s mouth curled up into a half-smile, and he moved one hand to slide his fingers lightly over Ty\u2019s lips. Ty blinked rapidly at him. \u201cThanks, Zane,\u201d he finally managed to say. It felt silly to say it. But it was the only thing coming to mind. At least he was no longer afraid of making a fool of himself in front of Zane. He wouldn\u2019t be able to function at this point if he worried about that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane hummed slightly, and his eyes remained trained on Ty. When he spoke, it came out a little deeper. \u201cWell, don\u2019t get used to it. I expect a lot more fighting in our future. That\u2019s how we get along best, remember?\u201d</p><p>Ty gave him a weak smile and nodded.</p><p>Zane shook his head and poked Ty in the ribs. \u201cQuit thinking so hard,\u201d he said as he tried to muffle a yawn. He curled his arm around Ty\u2019s waist and dragged him close enough that their bodies bumped gently from chest to knee. \u201cSleep,\u201d he murmured, his lips close to Ty\u2019s temple.</p> <p>Ty swallowed hard and closed his eyes, turning his face into Zane\u2019s and inhaling his scent deeply. Just as it always did, it sent a thrill through him and caused a dull ache to start in his chest.</p><p>What he was afraid of, he\u2019d come to realize, was not dark spaces or falling from great heights or being buried alive. His greatest fears, in the end, were letting down those he loved and saying the words \u201cI love you\u201d without any hope of hearing them in return.</p><p>He knew, deep down somewhere, that if he fell for Zane Garrett, he\u2019d be falling alone.</p><p>RICHARD BURNS sat back in his chair with a long sigh. He waited a few moments to ponder what Earl Grady had related to him on the phone. It had been a week since Earl and the boys had made it off the mountain, but he was just now getting the full story. At first blush, it was hard to tell whether the debacle would fall under FBI jurisdiction. It might be handled by the Parks Department or the local law enforcement. Hell, treasure hunters and a booby-trapped mountain could even fall to the National Guard. Burns really hoped the Bureau wouldn\u2019t need to deal with it.</p><p>A team of rangers had located two of the dead men, although they\u2019d had to comb several miles down a ravine for one of them. The shooting was being half-heartedly investigated, but Burns had no doubt Zane would be cleared. He had three good men vouching that he\u2019d saved Ty\u2019s life and that deadly force had been required. There was no trace of the third hunter. And so far four bodies of missing hikers had been found in the area of the main camp.</p> <p>The only thing that concerned Burns was how Earl and the boys were handling themselves since they\u2019d come off the mountain. Burns knew there was going to be some fallout over the events Earl Grady had described. Earl had sounded close to tears as he\u2019d told Burns about what he\u2019d said to his son. Burns had been dumbfounded as he listened, unable to do anything but call his old friend an idiot and tell him to fix it.</p><p>Whether Ty or Earl would ever get around to fixing it was the real question. And knowing Ty like he did, it might just roll off him like water off a duck. It was hard to predict what would hit that boy hard and what would glance off. Ty had been through a lot of things like they were a walk in the park, things that would have mentally destroyed a lot of people. But when his cat had died of old age a few years ago, Ty had been inconsolable for a week.</p><p>Burns told himself not to worry. Things would be resolved, or they wouldn\u2019t. It was one family affair he would stay out of if at all possible.</p><p>They were all home safe now, anyway, which was sort of a miracle considering Ty had stayed in West Virginia for a third week of vacation along with Deuce. Burns kept expecting to hear about a mushroom cloud appearing over the West Virginia mountains.</p><p>Zane Garrett had returned to DC earlier than his partner, but as Burns had ordered, he hadn\u2019t turned up at the office at all and hadn\u2019t made a single noise about the extra week of vacation tacked on to his original three. Burns did know, through regular channels, that Garrett had shown up at the Bureau clinic and requested an appointment; he\u2019d been attending the therapy sessions like clockwork, and the results were already very promising. Apparently, whatever had happened up on that mountain had convinced Zane that he needed to get himself together.</p><p>Burns sat staring at the packet of transfer papers on his desk, tapping it with his finger. Zane had passed all his evals earlier that day\u2014blowing the academic end out of the water, as per usual; showing an excellent score on the physical; and squeaking by on the psych exam, to Burns\u2019 relief. Ty was almost fully recovered from his ordeal with the cat, although he\u2019d be in the cast for a couple more weeks, probably. They were about ready to be reinserted into light fieldwork. Burns needed to sign these last papers, and the transfers to Baltimore would be final.</p> <p>He just needed to know one thing before he could in good conscience put Grady and Garrett on another assignment together. He picked up his personal cell phone and hit the speed dial.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, son,\u201d Burns requested after the man answered. He pushed the button to turn on the speaker and set the phone on his desk. \u201cI need you to tell me about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, sir, I feel the need to reiterate my extreme discomfort with this situation,\u201d the voice emitting from the speaker said seriously.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, son, I know it feels a little dirty. But it\u2019s for his own good,\u201d Burns responded wearily. He was so tired of worrying, and he knew that while it felt slightly wrong to be doing this, it would also ease his mind both professionally and personally. \u201cYou know how hard-headed he is, he\u2019d never let us do this with his knowledge. Now tell me what you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeacon,\u201d Burns bit off sharply. \u201cI would not ask this of you if it weren\u2019t important. Please. I don\u2019t want to hear about Garrett, there\u2019s doctor/patient privilege involved now,\u201d he said before Deuce Grady could remind him of the fact. For all the rules the Grady brothers had stretched, bent, crossed, and broken over the years, Deuce was admirably inflexible when it came to his work.</p><p>\u201cTy also speaks to me with the expectation of confidence,\u201d Deuce murmured. \u201cIt feels wrong to talk about him to you, Dick.\u201d</p><p>Burns knew how Deuce felt. Dirty and dishonest. Burns had felt that way when he\u2019d all but ordered Ty to go home. He\u2019d felt that way when he\u2019d called Deuce to request he observe them closely. But he knew that if the Gradys weren\u2019t as close as family to him, he wouldn\u2019t be dealing with these issues at all. He\u2019d just send Ty to a therapist and get a nice clinical evaluation of his mental state and then send Ty and Zane together to determine how they worked as a team.</p> <p>But Ty had too much psychological training to go to a psychiatrist and not say just what needed to be said. He had to be tricked into it. And until just recently, Zane had to be pushed with a cattle prod to even get him into the doctor\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know what Ty talks to you about,\u201d Burns assured him softly. \u201cJust tell me,\u201d he continued sympathetically, \u201cis he still\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSane?\u201d Deuce provided flatly.</p><p>Burns sighed loudly. \u201cIs he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him like he was up there on the mountain, Dick,\u201d Deuce confided. \u201cBut then, I\u2019ve never seen him at work, so that could just be how he handles the stress of nearly being killed all the time. Hard to say. In my professional opinion, he\u2019s nuttier than squirrel shit,\u201d he claimed. Burns laughed before he could stop himself. That was what all the Bureau shrinks thought too. \u201cBut as his brother, I\u2019d say he\u2019s as sane as he\u2019s ever been,\u201d Deuce continued confidently. \u201cI\u2019m not certain how many more of your little special cases he can go on and remain that way, though,\u201d he added disapprovingly.</p><p>Burs pursed his lips and scowled. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know how you know about those cases,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cWhen he\u2019s done he\u2019ll tell me,\u201d he stated in a voice that said that line of conversation was done. \u201cDo they function as a team?\u201d Burns asked slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s all I want to know, Deacon. Can I, in good conscience, keep them together and expect them both to live through it?\u201d</p><p>Deuce was silent. Burns could hear him tapping a pen on a pad of paper as he mulled over the question. \u201cI think,\u201d Deuce drew out hesitantly, \u201c\u2018function\u2019 is perhaps too strong a word.\u201d</p><p>Burns closed his eyes and placed a hand over his forehead, feeling his heart sink.</p><p>\u201cMy brother would take a bullet for his partner,\u201d Deuce added assuredly. \u201cI mean, we know that from experience. The thing is, it wouldn\u2019t matter who his partner was. He just thinks that\u2019s part of his job. And his goal in life is to do his job well.\u201d</p><p>Burns nodded silently. Anyone who knew Ty even a little bit knew that much. He had always been driven toward something no one else could see, and he still was. It seemed like the man felt his purpose in life had always been to die for a cause. He had been trying to get himself killed ever since he could walk.</p><p>Burns could count on one hand the number of times Ty Grady had told him \u201cno\u201d in the past six or seven years. He was always ready, always willing, and always more than capable of doing whatever Burns needed. It was one reason he was so valuable. And one reason he scared the ever-loving bejeezus out of Burns.</p><p>\u201cThe real interesting thing, though, is that Zane Garrett would do the same for Ty,\u201d Deuce concluded.</p><p>Burns raised his head and stared at the phone. \u201cReally?\u201d he asked in unconcealed surprise.</p><p>Deuce laughed softly. \u201cI believe so, yes. As a unit, they are largely uncooperative, unorganized, antagonistic toward each other, stubborn when problems arise, and they conceal their weaknesses from each other and sometimes from themselves. But somehow, it works for them. They trust each other. They\u2019re fiercely loyal to each other, as well. When there\u2019s an outside force working against them, they pull it together in one way or another and defend one another. Viciously, if need be. Zane Garrett stood up to my father, Dick. More than once.\u201d He paused to allow that information to sink in and then continued. \u201cIn my professional opinion, they aren\u2019t fit to be partnered with anyone but each other,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cThey\u2019d drive anyone else crazy.\u201d</p><p>Burns sagged his shoulders in relief, sitting back in his leather chair with a sigh. He hadn\u2019t even wanted to consider the nightmare of trying to find Grady and Garrett new partners. They would\u2019ve had to have both gone solo, and that meant undercover for Ty and a desk for Zane. Neither of which would end well.</p><p>\u201cThe only issue I can see arising in the future is... personal,\u201d Deuce said in a careful voice.</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d Burns asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t tell if they like each other or not,\u201d Deuce answered with a small laugh.</p><p>Burns smiled slightly. \u201cWell. We\u2019ll just have to see, I suppose. Thank you, Deacon,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, you do,\u201d Deuce assured him. He ended the call before Burns could respond.</p><p>After a long moment\u2019s consideration, Burns reached to press the intercom button on his desk. \u201cGet me Ty Grady on the phone, please,\u201d he requested of his secretary.</p><p>\u201cUm, sir?\u201d she responded uncertainly. \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Burns asked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Grady is sitting out here, waiting to see you,\u201d she said with a hint of suspicion in her voice.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s waiting?\u201d Burns asked in disbelief. Ty had never sat out there patiently and waited to be seen. \u201cSend him in,\u201d he requested, alarmed. He stood as Ty was shown into the office.</p><p>\u201cYou look better than I thought you would,\u201d he told the younger man as soon as the door was closed.</p><p>Ty gave him a game smile and moved to take a seat across from Burns. Burns slowly sat down again.</p><p>\u201cWhen I started with the Bureau,\u201d Ty said without further small talk, \u201cyou told me there were three situations where I could quit your... personal missions,\u201d he said haltingly.</p><p>Burns nodded slowly, a hint of worry forming. \u201cIf you ever got married, had a child, or felt you were physically or mentally incapable of performing,\u201d he listed off in slight trepidation.</p><p>Ty nodded. He looked determined, and Burns wondered how much time Ty had taken to work up the nerve to have this conversation. \u201cSir, I\u2019m not getting married,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a father. And I can honestly say that I do believe I\u2019m still capable, physically and mentally,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cBut I would like to request a temporary break to the assignments, nonetheless,\u201d he said in a voice that was confident, if a little sad.</p><p>Burns could see clearly that Ty had anguished over this decision. His heart went out to the kid, and he wondered what had happened to precipitate this sort of decision. Was it what had happened on the mountain or had this been a long time in coming? Either way, Ty had lasted longer than Burns had ever expected.</p><p>He found himself nodding. \u201cCare to share the reason?\u201d he asked. Ty blinked at him, the only change to his expression as he sat stiffly in the seat across from Burns. Burns cocked his head sympathetically. \u201cWould you tell me as a friend, rather than your boss?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Ty lowered his head, linking his fingers together. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing... bad,\u201d he assured Burns finally. \u201cThere\u2019re just some things I need to take care of\u2014personal things\u2014before I give any more of my time,\u201d he explained, looking up to meet Burns\u2019 eyes from under lowered brows.</p><p>Burns found himself nodding again, realizing that he\u2019d grant any request Ty made right now. He looked determined, if nothing else, and Burns wondered what could have finally found a place in Ty\u2019s life that he put ahead of his job. Burns would never have thought it possible. He hoped Ty wasn\u2019t lying to him and that it really was something good, rather than something that had happened on that mountain.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Ty murmured as he stood again.</p><p>Burns stood with him, coming around the desk to walk him to the door. \u201cTy,\u201d Burns said worriedly as he reached out and took Ty\u2019s shoulder to stop him. \u201cI heard about what happened,\u201d he said with a deep frown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty nodded, meeting Burns\u2019 eyes apprehensively. \u201cDad told you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHe did. You did well, son,\u201d Burns told him sincerely. \u201cYou made us both proud.\u201d Ty merely nodded again, swallowing hard and turning away. \u201cHe told me what he said to you up there,\u201d Burns told him unflinchingly.</p><p>Ty froze, his fingers gripping the handle of the door until his knuckles turned white. He turned slightly, his head still bowed. He looked as if he might want to say something, but Burns realized with an ache deep in his chest that Ty wasn\u2019t capable of speaking as he tried to regain control of his emotions. Ty and Deuce were the sons he\u2019d never had, and it pained him to see one of them struggling like this.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re no coward, Beaumont, and your daddy knows that better than anyone,\u201d Burns told him softly. Ty bowed his head and closed his eyes. Burns fought the impulse to pull him into a hug.</p><p>\u201cSticks and stones, sir,\u201d Ty finally managed to respond. He raised his head again, nodding at Burns. While he looked resigned, he actually smiled before turning and leaving the office. \u201cBut words will never hurt me,\u201d he recited in a singsong voice as he walked away.</p><p>Burns stood in the office door, watching him go with a small smile. Ty was truly a resilient man. He enjoyed life too much to let anything get him down for long.</p><p>Burns remembered suddenly that he hadn\u2019t told Ty about the reassignment he had for them. Ty would be ecstatic to hear that Zane Garrett was already settling into a new Baltimore apartment and that the Gummi worms he\u2019d hidden in his old desk in the Baltimore field office had been located and cleared out in anticipation of his return.</p><p>\u201cGrady,\u201d Burns called, gesturing for Ty to come back. He smiled widely, causing Ty to raise an eyebrow warily as he stopped in the doorway that led out of the front office. \u201cI almost forgot. I have some good news,\u201d he said, gesturing him to return and slapping him on the back as he directed him to sit back down.</p> <p>STACKING another empty box off to the side of the couch, Zane looked around at his progress. Not that he had all that much to unpack\u2014he\u2019d gotten rid of more stuff over the past few years than he\u2019d acquired. So it was mostly books, not knickknacks or pictures. It wasn\u2019t cozy or decorated, but it was home now.</p><p>His new apartment in Baltimore was a ground level walk-up with a back door, which he liked. He always liked back doors. There was enough room out on the back porch for a small grill too, and he thought he might enjoy doing something that mundane for a change.</p><p>Zane hummed slightly and slid the last of the books onto the shelf, and his fingers lingered on the volume of Edgar Allen Poe stories before he headed to the kitchen for a drink.</p><p>A knock at the front door stopped him. Frowning, Zane turned to look at the door before glancing at his gun where it lay on the table with his wallet. A look at the clock confirmed it was the middle of the afternoon. He\u2019d hate to pull a gun on somebody welcoming him to the neighborhood, so he went to the door without the weapon and pulled it open.</p><p>Ty stood on the top step, his head cocked slightly and a small smile on his lips. \u201cNice neighborhood,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Zane said in surprise. He hadn\u2019t seen Ty in almost two weeks, though they\u2019d talked on the phone a few times. He\u2019d missed seeing Ty, more than he thought he should.</p> <p>Ty merely gave him a smug smile. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Zane said, stepping back and leading the way into the apartment. It wasn\u2019t a big one. A decent-sized front room with a couch, coffee table, and TV was separated from the kitchen by a bar, and a doorway to the right opened to a small hallway that was just big enough for four more doors: two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a closet. A washer and dryer were in a closet by the back door. It was more than he needed.</p><p>Ty looked around the living room as he walked into the apartment. He slid his hand into his jeans and shrugged uncomfortably as he turned and faced Zane again, giving him an uncharacteristically nervous smile.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Zane asked, looking him up and down. Despite the slight show of nerves, Ty looked pretty good, actually: clean-shaven, color back, not so worn out, mostly relaxed, though not totally. The only time Zane had seen Ty totally relaxed was after he fucked him into the mattress. It had been a while.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Ty answered with a nod. \u201cNo longer dying,\u201d he added with a small smirk. The quirk to his lips fell, though, and he raised his chin slightly as he looked at Zane. \u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d he stated, his voice calm, but his posture screaming he was dreading the coming conversation, whatever it was about. Zane wondered if Ty realized how much he showed his partner through his expressions and body language. He suspected not.</p><p>The apprehension was catching, apparently, because Zane felt it tighten around his chest. \u201cWell. Sounds like a reason for a smoke break,\u201d he said, gesturing to the door at the far side of the kitchen. Ty nodded, not even offering a disapproving word about the cigarettes. He followed Zane out, glancing around at the bits and pieces Zane had unpacked as they went.</p><p>Zane stopped outside the screen door and picked up the pack he\u2019d left sitting out on the railing. He shook it, sliding the lighter out, and lit up as Ty joined him. He looked over his partner\u2019s face, trying to see some sort of clue about what he had to say.</p><p>Ty was looking out over the backyard, his lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes worried. He looked around and then sat down on the top step with a heavy sigh. \u201cI had some time to do some thinking,\u201d he said after a moment of silence.</p> <p>\u201cDeuce kept Mara distracted, hmm?\u201d Zane tapped ash off into an ashtray he\u2019d left on the wooden porch railing.</p><p>\u201cThe shovel did, actually,\u201d Ty answered as he looked up at Zane and smiled fondly. Zane grinned and chuckled as he watched the smile light up Ty\u2019s eyes. It got him in the gut, and he took another drag off the cigarette to combat the feeling. Now wasn\u2019t the time. Ty continued to look up at him, watching him hesitantly as if trying to gauge his mood. Finally, he dropped his eyes. \u201cI know what I\u2019m about to say probably isn\u2019t what you want to hear, and I\u2019m sorry. But I need to say it, regardless,\u201d he said apologetically.</p><p>Sighing softly, Zane sat heavily beside his partner. It didn\u2019t sound good, what Ty was hinting at. They sat side-by-side silently for a moment, Zane still with his cigarette, both hesitant to continue the conversation.</p><p>Finally, Ty cleared his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t know how else to say it, Zane, so I\u2019ll just come out with it,\u201d he said quickly as he raised his head and looked at Zane with a stubborn set to his jaw. \u201cDespite the desk work and the near-death experiences and the bullshit in the mountains....\u201d He took a deep breath and blew it out heavily. \u201cThe last couple months have been some good ones, and it\u2019s solely because of you,\u201d he told Zane slowly.</p><p>Zane raised one brow, surprised. But before he could think of anything to say, Ty shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI like being able to wake up to you. I like knowing you\u2019ll be there if I need you,\u201d he continued, obviously uncomfortable with what he was saying but refusing to be deterred now that he\u2019d begun. \u201cI like being with you, Zane. And I\u2019d like to keep that up now that you\u2019re here,\u201d he admitted shakily. He met Zane\u2019s eyes determinedly. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, Zane found that all he could do was sit there. Despite how they\u2019d gotten closer, some things were just unspoken; he wouldn\u2019t have imagined hearing this sort of thing from Ty again. The last time had been when they were reunited in DC\u2014more than two months ago\u2014and that had been during a seriously emotional outburst on both their parts. That certainly wasn\u2019t common. And the slow but steady drift apart afterward had made that memory, that warmth and knowledge, fade. But here Ty was, saying it again.</p><p>As for himself, he\u2019d said as much to Deuce up on that mountain. He\u2019d wanted Ty since the first time Ty had met his eyes evenly and given him a soft smile. When Zane allowed himself to think about it, he had to admit that he was a hell of a sucker for the man. The realization had hit him right between the eyes before he left West Virginia. But he tried not to think about it\u2014tried not to think about more\u2014because it was far too close to feelings that terrified him, deeper feelings he knew could cause so much pain when things went bad. Deuce had been right. Feeling too much was what Zane was afraid of. But wanting....</p><p>Ty nodded at Zane\u2019s silence, light color spreading across his cheekbones as he looked down again. \u201cI just wanted you to know,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>He stood up and reached out to affectionately pet Zane on the head as he walked by, heading back into the apartment. Zane reached out to grab his wrist and he stood. His gut clenched with delight. Hell, there had never been any question that he wanted Ty. Surely Ty knew that without Zane having to say it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on board with that,\u201d he declared.</p><p>Ty blinked at him, his fingers curling around Zane\u2019s hand as Zane held his wrist tightly. \u201cReally?\u201d he asked in honest surprise.</p><p>Zane smiled warmly. \u201cReally. I want you here, with me,\u201d he assured him. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re home,\u201d he added softly.</p><p>Ty actually managed to blush further, and he swatted at Zane\u2019s head as he backed away. Zane grinned as he reached out and caught Ty again around the waist.</p><p>\u201cRumor has it we\u2019re being put back into fieldwork next week,\u201d Ty told him as he let himself be dragged back close to Zane.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be safer there,\u201d Zane responded wryly as he pressed his forehead to Ty\u2019s and brushed his nose against Ty\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Ty laughed, the sound rich and honest and carefree. True to form, all the problems and hangups and issues that had been thrown at them had already slid right off his back, and the Ty Grady Zane knew so well was here with him again, alive and well, and they were together. Now Zane had every reason he needed to get himself straightened out.</p><p>No way was he going to fuck it up. </p> </body></html>"]
