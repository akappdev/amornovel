I was Regina Afton. I was Anna Morrison\u2019s best friend. These weren\u2019t small things, and despite what you may think, at the time they were worth keeping my mouth shut for.</p> <p>Everyone is wasted.</p><p>Anna is wasted. Josh is wasted. Marta is wasted. Jeanette is wasted. Bruce is wasted. Donnie\u2019s always wasted. I\u2019m not wasted. I had my turn at the last party, called shotgun in Anna\u2019s Benz after it was over. My head was out the window, the world was spinning. I puked my guts out. It wasn\u2019t fun, but it\u2019s not like there was anything else to do. Tonight, there\u2019s even less to do than that. Tonight, I\u2019m the designated driver.</p><p>Boring.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, just\u2014\u201d Josh fumbles into his pocket and pulls out a little baggie of capsules. He tips one, two, three, four into his palm while Charlie Simmons, a fat, cranky sophomore, waits impatiently. \u201cI have to restock.\u201d He drops the pills into Charlie\u2019s piggy hands. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can give you right now, man.\u201d</p><p>Charlie sniffs. Fitting: All that Adderall is going up his nose.</p> <p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201cJosh\u2019s eyes glaze over. \u201cForget about it. I like you, Chuck.\u201d Charlie grins. \u201cCool. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Chuck, you\u2019re paying,\u201d I say, grabbing his arm. Instant scowl. \u201cBring the money on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>He stalks off. Payment secured. I only strong-arm Josh\u2019s clientele when Josh gives his merchandise away, which is every time he gets this drunk.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Regina.\u201d He somehow manages to trip over his feet, even though he\u2019s just standing there. He wraps an arm around me. \u201cShow a little respect, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck Charlie Simmons.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, and the ability to remain upright completely abandons him, forcing all his weight on me. I struggle to keep us standing, casting my gaze around the property for help. The lights are on, the music\u2019s loud, and I spot a few people puking in the topiary, but none of them are my friends.</p><p>Josh buries his head into my neck. \u201cYou look hot tonight.\u201d His blond hair tickles my face, and I push him back. It\u2019s too hot out to be this close. \u201cI mentioned that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He laughs again, like Let\u2019s go inside is code for something it\u2019s not, but I guess he\u2019s right: I guess I look hot tonight. Anna loaned me a shirt and skirt, and everything she owns is nice. I want you to look really good for once, Regina. I\u2019ve spent the last seven hours afraid someone\u2019s going to vomit all over me, because I can\u2019t afford to replace the labels I\u2019m wearing.</p><p>I help Josh up the path to his front door. He stops abruptly, opens his arms wide, and shouts, \u201cIs everybody having a good time?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s met with scattered applause and cheers that barely make it over the music. He shakes his head ruefully, listing sideways. I wonder what would happen if I just let him fall this time, but he manages to regain his balance without my help.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re graduating in like, eight, months,\u201d he tells me very seriously. \u201cI\u2019m going to Yale. Who will supply these poor kids while I\u2019m gone?\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes and right him for the thousandth time, forcing him into the house, where it\u2019s a different kind of party-chaos\u2014quieter, but just as corrupt. Music filters in from outside, clashing with the music playing inside. Four seniors are toking up at the kitchen table. Drinking games. People making out in the living room. It\u2019s boring\u2014it always is\u2014but it\u2019s all there is. I just wish I was trashed enough to be able to pretend to enjoy it. I hate being designated driver. It was Kara\u2019s turn this time, but she\u2019s at home, sick.</p><p>\u201cAre we going upstairs?\u201d Josh asks when we reach the stairs. Before I can answer, he crumples onto the steps in a heap, too heavy for me to pick up. He rolls onto his back and blinks twice, struggling to focus. \u201cIs this my bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I lie.</p><p>I bend down and kiss his cheek.</p><p>The smoke wafting in from the kitchen is giving me a headache, or maybe it\u2019s the music\u2014I don\u2019t know. I lean against the wall and check my watch. It\u2019s officially Too Late, but Anna says the designated driver doesn\u2019t get to decide when the party is over; everyone else gets to decide when they\u2019re over the party. And Anna\u2014I lost her an hour ago. Her face was as red as her hair, and she was slobbering all over Donnie.</p><p>I sigh.</p><p>Jeanette lurches up from out of nowhere looking like a guarantied good time. Strung out. I can never tell when she\u2019s over the party; the party\u2019s usually all over her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d she declares. \u201cWith Henry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Henry sober?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d Henry says in my ear, startling me. He grins and points to Josh, sprawled out on the stairs. \u201cYou can\u2019t just leave him there.\u201d</p><p>I ignore him and turn to her. \u201cWhere\u2019s Marta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting in the car.\u201d She brushes her hair out of her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re dropping her off at her house, and then me and Henry are going back to his place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Henry sober?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here,\u201d Henry says, annoyed. \u201cAnd you already asked that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to go to his place?\u201d I ask Jeanette. Another of my duties as designated driver. If I can\u2019t prevent an undesirable drunken hookup, then why bother being here sober in the first place? Jeanette grins and nods.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m in the circle,\u201d Henry points out. \u201cI get an automatic pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re kind of an asshole,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He smirks and laces his fingers through Jeanette\u2019s. They amble through the smoke. He glances back at me once. \u201cHave fun babysitting, Afton.\u201d</p><p>Josh on the stairs. Marta in the car. Henry taking her home. Henry taking Jeanette back to his place. I don\u2019t care about Bruce, so that just leaves Anna and Donnie. I know they\u2019re in the den. They always end up in the den if Josh and I don\u2019t get there first. The den is off-limits.</p><p>But we\u2019re in the circle.</p><p>I bypass the living-room festivities, open the door to the den, step inside, and close it behind me. The party noises fade and the room is dim, moonlight slivering in through the curtain drawn over the glass doors that lead to the backyard. I close my eyes briefly, inhaling slowly, letting the semiquiet of it all kill my headache.</p><p>When I open my eyes, I spot Anna at one end of the room. She\u2019s curled up on the couch, a picture of six shots of Jack chased with one Heineken too many. She drinks too much around Donnie, desperate to keep up with him, like the difference between him staying with her and leaving her is her blood-alcohol level.</p><p>\u201cI need a girlfriend who can hold her liquor,\u201d he says.</p><p>Maybe it is. Donnie\u2019s lounging in the chair at the opposite end of the room, looking as half awake as he always does. No matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t seem to talk Anna out of him. He has a convertible.</p><p>She\u2019d kill me if I left her here like this, so I lean over her ear and say her name, loud and sharp: \u201cAnna.\u201d She doesn\u2019t move. I pull on her arm, tap her face, shake her. Nothing. I make my way over to the pitcher of water sitting on the end table beside Donnie.</p><p>\u201cHelp me get her to the car,\u201d I say.</p><p>He stares at me. \u201cWhy? Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me? I\u2019m in no condition to get myself back to my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what happens to you. I\u2019m going home and I\u2019m taking Anna with me.\u201d I grab the water and pour a glass, cross the room, and try to get her upright enough to take a sip, somehow. \u201cAnna, come on...\u201d</p><p>She flops back on the couch. I rub my forehead\u2014my headache\u2019s returning\u2014and make my way back to Donnie with the glass.</p><p>\u201cWould you give me a hand?\u201d He stares at me and then grabs my arm. The water sloshes onto the table. \u201cChrist, Donnie.\u201d</p><p>He keeps his hand on my arm, and I\u2019m suddenly aware of how much skin Anna\u2019s shirt isn\u2019t covering, but I guess that\u2019s the point.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you care what happens to me?\u201d</p><p>He sounds as pathetic as he looks.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re drunk.\u201d I step back, but he keeps his hand on my arm. \u201cJust crash here,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m not driving you home.\u201d He digs his nails into my skin. I yank his hand off me. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he repeats in a soft falsetto, and then he grabs my other arm before I can move, gripping them both so tightly, I know I\u2019ll still feel his fingers tomorrow. He uses me to get to his feet, and then he\u2019s on his feet and he\u2019s close. v</p><p>Too close.</p><p>I turned him down in the ninth grade. Anna likes to say we\u2019ve been close to hate-fucking ever since, which is too gross for me to even contemplate. It\u2019s a gunshot kind of thing for her to say\u2014a warning. The way she says it, it\u2019s like she can see it happening, and the way she says it lets me know I better not let it happen.</p><p>As if I\u2019d ever let Donnie get that close to me, anyway. Except now he\u2019s that close to me, and I think he\u2019s thinking the wrong things.</p><p>He is. He presses his mouth against mine, mashing my lips against my teeth. The inevitability of every party: Someone will kiss you and you won\u2019t want it. Except this is worse than that. Way, way worse. This is my best friend\u2019s boyfriend, and my best friend is passed out on a couch eight feet away, and she will kill me for this, and I really, really don\u2019t want it. I press my hands against his chest and push him back, trying to force stop out of my mouth and past his. He detaches himself and fumbles backward. I wipe my mouth on the back of my hand, trying to get the taste of him out. I need water. I need to spit. He grabs my arm. I try to jerk away, but he holds fast.</p><p>\u201cYou better not breathe a word about this to her\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDonnie, fuck off.\u201d</p><p>He keeps tightening his grip until I can\u2019t keep the pain off my face\u2014it hurts\u2014so I bring my foot down on his foot and watch that happen on his face. It bursts red and I\u2019m free. I rush to the door, but before I can open it, he\u2019s on me, crushing me into place from behind and breathing so hard in my ear, I can\u2019t even hear the vague sounds of the music outside or in. What turns a moment into this\u2014me against the door, him against me. He puts his hand on my shoulder and turns me around roughly, and I\u2019m afraid.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been afraid of Donnie Henderson before.</p> <p>He forces another kiss on me, lips working overtime, trying to get something out of mine. I grab a fistful of his hair and pull. He shoves me, but I stumble past him. The brief space I put between us makes me think it\u2019ll be okay, that this is as out of hand as it gets, but it\u2019s too close or it\u2019s not close enough and he lunges for me and we both go down.</p><p>We\u2019re on the floor.</p><p>He pushes me into the carpet. I glimpse Anna, tangled red hair, eyes closed. Anna, wake up. What turns a moment into this\u2014he\u2019s on top of me, panting, and my face is smashed against the rug. I focus on the strands of hair laid gently across Anna\u2019s face. This isn\u2019t happening.</p><p>But he turns me over and slides his hand up my skirt, and this is really really really really happening. \u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p><p>I reach out and grip one of the table legs. His hand up my skirt. One hand up my skirt. Touching me. And the other clumsily feeling every part of me it can. His mouth on my neck. I yank the leg. The table tips and the pitcher rolls off, vomiting water all over us. Wet. Hands all over me.</p> <p>I grab the pitcher and bring it up and then down on him. It\u2019s hardly a hit, but he feels it. I raise it up again and he dodges me and I\u2019m crawling away. Last shot, Regina. Get out. I grab the chair and pull myself to my feet while he tries to stand, but the last of his coordination is gone on his hand up my skirt. Anna\u2019s skirt.</p><p>\u201cAnna!\u201d I turn to her. \u201cAnna, help!\u201d</p><p>But she just lays there, and Donnie\u2019s blocking my path to the door, swearing, trying to stand, and my heart is trying to race me out of this room before that happens. I stumble over to the sliding glass door and yank it open. I step outside, into the heat, into the party, the last of the party, but the music is as loud as it was at the start of the night.</p><p>I need to tell someone, but everyone is wasted.</p><p>I walk fast. I walk forever, blind, numb. I wrap my arms around myself. I need to tell someone. I lick my lips and taste salt: I\u2019m crying. How long have I been\u2014</p><p>Kara.</p> <p>I\u2019m standing in front of Kara\u2019s house. My feet walked me here. Kara. Kara is someone. The walk to her door sets off the motion sensor, soaking me in artificial too-bright light. I knock and wait, fighting the urge to throw up. I wipe my eyes and pull at Anna\u2019s skirt. It\u2019s torn.</p><p>A minute later, the door opens. Kara\u2019s there, a fevered doll with blond curls hanging in front of her flushed face. She crinkles her snotty nose.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Regina. What part of \u2018designated driver\u2019 don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p><p>The contempt in her voice almost tricks me into feeling normal. For a second. And then she looks closer and I remember the skirt\u2014 Anna\u2019s skirt\u2014and his hand up Anna\u2019s skirt. And I\u2019m still crying.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d she asks.</p><p>A million words fight their way up my throat, all lobbying to be first out of my mouth. They pile up, stuck. Only one manages its way out: \u201cHelp.\u201d</p><p>She lets me inside, and the rest of the words come, falling from my lips, a stupid, stuttering truth. By the time I collapse in a chair at the kitchen table, she knows what he did to me. And then it gets really quiet while I wait for her to tell me what to do.</p><p>I need someone to tell me what to do.</p> <p>Anna always tells me what to do.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Kara murmurs, pressing her fingers against the angry spots on my arm where he grabbed me. The skin is tender and marked, but by Monday it will be splotchy purples, browns, and yellows.</p><p>\u201cThe police?\u201d I ask. My voice cracks. \u201cDo you think? Do I go to the police?\u201d</p><p>Kara stares at me, and then she stands and goes into the fridge and gets a bottle of water. I can\u2019t read her expression.</p><p>\u201cYou really want to put yourself through that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could put Donnie through that.\u201d I rub my forehead. But I don\u2019t really want to go through that. I don\u2019t want to talk to the police about his hand up my skirt. And then\u2014my parents. It\u2019s not like you can do that and not tell your parents, and I don\u2019t want them to know. I don\u2019t want them to think of me on the floor, with Donnie\u2019s hands there. Kara sets the water in front of me. \u201cMaybe Anna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell Anna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has to know\u2014\u201d I swallow. \u201cThat\u2019s her boyfriend. She won\u2019t let him get away with it.\u201d She\u2019ll take care of him. Me. She takes care of everything.</p><p>\u201cIf she believes you.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth and nothing comes out. If she believes you. I should\u2019ve known Kara would do this. There\u2019s a reason we hate each other. If she believes you.</p><p>\u201cLook, I believe you,\u201d Kara says, reading my mind. \u201cI know you hate Donnie, and I can see him doing something like this, but...Anna\u2019s always thought...\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re like, this close to hate-fucking.</p><p>I pick at the hem of Anna\u2019s skirt. The jagged rip in it finally hits me. She\u2019ll kill me. She will kill me for ruining her skirt. \u201cShit.\u201d I stand and try to force the ragged sides together, like that\u2019s how you fix these things. \u201cI need to\u2014I told her I\u2019d be careful\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegina\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Anna I wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegina.\u201d She snaps her fingers twice. I let the skirt go and sink back into the chair. I need to get it together. Kara stares at me, concerned. I never thought I\u2019d live a moment that could exist outside our hate for each other. I could go my whole life without one. But this feels...safe.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you\u2014so what do I do, Kara? What...?\u201d</p><p>She sits across from me, quiet, for a long time. My stomach knots itself up while I wait for her to speak. If I have to live with this, I don\u2019t want it to be hard.</p><p>\u201cDonnie\u2019s not going to tell Anna,\u201d she finally says. \u201cAnd Anna\u2019s not going to believe Donnie would do that to you. She\u2019d think you were screwing around behind her back. It\u2019s not fair, but that\u2019s Anna.\u201d</p><p>My best friend.</p><p>\u201cI mean...\u201d She taps her fingers along the table. \u201cHe was really wasted, right? It\u2019s not like he does that all the time....\u201d I don\u2019t say anything. \u201cAnd I feel really bad for you, Regina...but there are some things worth keeping your mouth shut for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my best friend.\u201d A tear manages its way down my cheek. I wipe at my eyes. \u201cI mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know what she\u2019d do to you if she found out, right?\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly. I know. And then I nod again: I know, I know, I know.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m totally here for you,\u201d she says. Kara. Totally here. Nothing makes sense anymore. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Kara presses her fingers against my arm again. Her touch is cool and strange.</p><p>I wake up, and the bruises on my arms have turned really yellow and brown, so I have to wear long sleeves, even though fall is doing its best impression of summer and the air is sticky and hot. Anna decided we\u2019ll all wear tank tops and miniskirts for as long as the weather holds\u2014before winter confines us to less revealing outfits\u2014 and I agreed, so I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll tell her when she sees me today and asks what my deal is.</p><p>And I\u2019ll have to tell her something, because I can\u2019t tell her the truth.</p><p>I debate various lies over breakfast, a pale pink antacid with coffee. I\u2019m a pretty good liar as long as I\u2019m talking to an easy sell, but Anna is not an easy sell. If she finds out I\u2019m hiding something, she\u2019ll want to know what. Maybe she\u2019ll be mad. Maybe she won\u2019t give a damn. Anna is funny like that.</p><p>I decide to tell her I\u2019m having a fat day.</p><p>\u201cLittle warm out for that shirt, isn\u2019t it, Regina?\u201d Mom asks, setting a plate of eggs and toast in front of Dad. Her comment draws his eyes up from the paper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll melt,\u201d he says.</p><p>I shrug and drain my coffee. \u201cWhatever. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>Halfway to school, I feel like I\u2019m going to throw up. I fan my face with my hand, and the air that meets my skin is hot. My shirt clings to my back, pressed uncomfortably into place by my book bag. A pay phone looms on the horizon, the closest thing I\u2019ve got to a cell phone, because my parents kind of suck. I drop my bag and rifle through my pockets for change until I find a quarter. I use it to call Josh.</p><p>Pick up, Josh. Pick up. I imagine the song that plays when someone calls his cell, exploding from his pocket until he picks up, but he never does, which is weird because Josh always picks up, and he\u2019s always good for a ride. He\u2019s my boyfriend.</p><p>Hallowell High: The parking lot pulses with scantily clad life, and I\u2019m in the middle of it all, wearing a sweater. My scraggly black hair is plastered to my forehead, and a couple people point and stare at me because I look that ridiculous, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m still better than them. It\u2019s not hard. Hallowell is one of those in-between towns, stuck between a city and another city, and everyone here knows everyone else. It\u2019s too small for a social landscape more complicated than this: You\u2019re either someone or you\u2019re not. I\u2019m someone.</p><p>I\u2019m Regina Afton. I\u2019m Anna Morrison\u2019s best friend. These aren\u2019t small things, and Kara\u2019s right: They\u2019re worth keeping my mouth shut for. So I kept my mouth shut the whole weekend, and I\u2019m still Regina Afton and I\u2019m still Anna Morrison\u2019s best friend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Friday never happened.</p><p>I wipe a light sheen of sweat from my forehead.

It\u2019s the only part of the day I sort of like, standing next to Anna, untouchable.</p><p>Everyone is afraid of us.</p> <p>Today, they\u2019re nowhere to be found.</p><p>I scope out the parking lot just in time to see a black convertible pull in. Donnie. My stomach twists and I can\u2019t breathe. I feel wrong in all the wrong places. I have to get inside. Now. I navigate the cacophony of voices, drug deals and insults\u2014</p><p>\u201c\u2014See you at lunch, okay?\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014I didn\u2019t finish it, but I don\u2019t think Bradbury will care\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014Wait up, I\u2019ve got to get\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2014For one pill? Fuck you! I can get them cheaper from\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014Slut! HEY, SLUT\u2014\u201d \u2014and push through the front doors, into the air-conditioned main corridor. I scan the halls. They can\u2019t be that far off. I just need to find them. I feel naked without them.</p><p>A flash of blond hair catches my eye.</p><p>\u201cKara!\u201d She doesn\u2019t turn around. She must not have heard me. \u201cKara!\u201d</p><p>She stops and I hurry over. Being next to her calms me a little; I\u2019m not invincible yet, but it\u2019s better than nothing. And it\u2019s weird. I never thought we could be friendly, but she was nice to me. So I\u2019ll be nice to her. For a while.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Anna?\u201d</p> <p>But she stares at me like I\u2019ve just told her to stab her eyes out with a pen, and even though she gives me that look a lot, I don\u2019t get it today.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah?\u201d Bitch-voice. Okay.</p><p>I readjust my book bag and clear my throat.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she? I want to talk to her. She called this weekend and I didn\u2019t pick up.\u201d I wasn\u2019t ready. \u201cYou know Anna. She\u2019ll be pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kara agrees. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Did you talk to her?\u201d</p><p>Kara shrugs and flounces down the hall, her golden curls bouncing off her shoulders as she goes. A bitter taste works its way up my throat in spite of the antacid I took. I follow her. She turns a corner. I turn it.</p><p>Jeanette and Marta are at Marta\u2019s locker. Kara prances over, and they enfold her into our secret huddle, the one I should be at the heart of, but my feet are cemented into place by some kind of animal instinct that tells me I\u2019m not allowed over there. Marta spots me. My heart leaps. Invite me over. She murmurs something to the other girls. Invite me over. They laugh. Invite me over.</p> <p>They turn their backs to me. No.</p><p>No way.</p><p>This is not a freeze-out.</p><p>But I have to find Anna to be sure.</p><p>She\u2019s not at her locker. I check her homeroom. She\u2019s not there either. I stalk the halls, and people are looking at me, whispering. But it\u2019s the sweater.</p><p>I detour into the girls\u2019 washroom, not because I think Anna will be there, but because my stomach is upset. I pop two more antacids and lean over the sink. My heart spazzes in my chest and my arms itch. I scratch along the outside of my sweater because I don\u2019t want to look at the bruises, even though I could close my eyes and see them.</p><p>I could close my eyes and see\u2014</p><p>Don\u2019t think about it. Don\u2019t think about it. Don\u2019t think about it.</p><p>I stare at my reflection in the mirror. My hair is limp, dead, and my face is an unattractive overheated red. Anna would not approve. Anna doesn\u2019t want to talk to me because...Because. Because.</p><p>I haven\u2019t returned her clothes yet.</p><p>I ignored her all weekend.</p><p>Duh.</p><p>Anna doesn\u2019t want to talk to me, and the other girls are giving me the Cryptic Cold Shoulder until I apologize to her. I exhale. It\u2019s almost comforting in its familiarity. I\u2019ve been here before and I can handle it. It\u2019s not fun, but it\u2019s easy.</p><p>It\u2019s not a freeze-out.</p><p>I\u2019ll find her. Apologize.</p><p>The first bell rings. Homeroom. I haven\u2019t even gotten my books. I leave the washroom and step into the hall, forcing my way past the whispers and stares.</p><p>It\u2019s the sweater. That\u2019s all it is.</p><p>And then I push through the crowd converged in front of my locker so I can get a good look at the word spray-painted across it.</p><p>WHORE</p><p>This is a freeze-out .</p><p>The scene fades out until it\u2019s me and that word and nothing else .</p><p>I step forward and touch my fingers to one of the letters. It comes back black. I rub my sleeve across the metal. The paint is fresh enough to ruin my shirt but dry enough to keep from smearing into an unintelligible mess.</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d Someone asks. I touch the paint again. It\u2019s really there. \u201cDid you really bone Donnie Henderson?\u201d</p><p>The scene fades back in. Voices assert themselves over the sound of my heart pounding in my chest, and they\u2019re all saying something about me.</p><p>Me. Donnie Henderson. Did I really bone Donnie Henderson.</p><p>His hand up my skirt. Mouth on my neck.</p><p>I step back and end up on someone\u2019s foot. They swear at me. Watch it, bitch. I focus on not looking like a cornered animal and try to zero in on a face I know, someone familiar amid the slack-jawed rubberneckers.</p><p>Josh. My boyfriend.</p><p>He hovers just outside the mob. Our eyes meet. He turns away.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, here comes Holt.\u201d Another voice. \u201cThis is so awe- some!\u201d</p><p>The second bell rings. Principal Holt is there before I can escape, the decrepit old janitor trailing behind him. His face purples as he surveys the damage. He paces, yells, and makes such a fuss, a new crowd is born. He orders a temporary cover for my locker until the paint can be removed, and he vows the perpetrators will be brought to justice.</p><p>And then he asks me if I know who they are.</p><p>After homeroom, I\u2019m gone. I\u2019m at that pay phone again and I\u2019m calling Josh. Again. I pick at the phone book dangling from a string, half torn away by some vandal with nothing better to do, while the sun continues its slow rise overhead. It\u2019s hot in this booth. I turn my back to the cars rushing past me, on their way to the main street.</p><p>I finally get his voice mail.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d A car goes by. I swallow twice and try to figure out what to say while the silence on the other end of the line waits for me to fill it. \u201cLook, what they\u2019re\u2014what they\u2019re all saying\u2014what I\u2014\u201d I can\u2019t tell this to Josh. Not on the phone.\u201d...You heard it from Kara, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I hang up. Kara.</p><p>Kara, Kara, Kara.</p><p>Kara Myers.</p><p>Kara.</p><p>I am such a fool.</p><p>I\u2019m used to everyone\u2019s eyes on me; that\u2019s nothing new. When you\u2019re</p><p>Anna Morrison\u2019s best friend, people look. We\u2019re the kind of popular that parents like to pretend doesn\u2019t exist so they can sleep at night, and we\u2019re the kind of popular that makes our peers unable to sleep at night. Everyone hates us, but they\u2019re afraid of us, too. Anna thrives on it. She says the day people stop hating us is the day something is really wrong. She says I should look at it that way, but I can\u2019t. Everyone hates us, and it makes me a total wreck. She hated that about me.</p><p>These people are nothing. They don\u2019t matter. None of this matters. There\u2019s a whole world outside of this hellhole. God, Regina. You could at least act like you don\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>So I do it like she does it: I square my shoulders and march across the parking lot, my jaw clenched and my eyes narrowed. I try not to let the heat touch me or flinch at the blast of cold air on my skin when I step through the school doors.</p><p>I\u2019m ushered in by whispers and stares. Half the student body relishes it; they\u2019ve waited a long time to show me just how much they hate me. The other half doesn\u2019t know what to make of it after spending four years fearfully revering me.</p><p>Principal Holt makes quick work of restoring my locker, but whoever repainted it doesn\u2019t know how to color-match. My locker has been painted red. Every other locker in this school is a bright, hideous pumpkin orange. It\u2019s a wash of a coat, too.</p><p>I can still see the WHORE forcing its way through.</p><p>I grab my books. Two girls go by, and I hear my name but not the context surrounding it. Probably something like: Regina Afton is a slut who slept with Anna Morrison\u2019s boyfriend I know can you believe it pass it on.</p><p>I will kill myself before I get used to this.</p><p>Anna catches my eye then, swaggering down the hall in the opposite direction. A dozen guys watch her as she goes; it\u2019s the way her skirt moves with her hips when she walks. She takes a sharp turn left, and I know where she\u2019s going. And she\u2019s alone.</p><p>This is my chance.</p><p>I take the same left, push through the pale blue door that opens into the girls\u2019 washroom, and there she is, admiring her reflection in the mirrors over the sinks. I don\u2019t blame her. Anna is beautiful, with her soft, fine auburn hair and the kind of body that brings guys to their knees. It\u2019s clich\u00e9, but she\u2019s a Siren. Impossible to fight, there\u2019s no better feeling than to hear her sing your name until she has you and eats you alive. The people at this school think it\u2019s hard enough living beneath her, but it\u2019s even harder being her friend. Anna.</p><p>The door swings shut. She stiffens and turns, and the air leaves my lungs. I\u2019m torn between wanting to be far away from her and wanting to throw myself at her feet to beg forgiveness for something I didn\u2019t do. As long as it means we can be friends again.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll never sleep with your boyfriend again, never, never, never....</p><p>Maybe I should\u2019ve thought this out better.</p><p>She takes me in slowly, one eyebrow arched. She wants me to feel like I\u2019m not good enough to be acknowledged, and it\u2019s working. I\u2019m suddenly aware of the sloppy ponytail tied at the back of my head and how dumb my outfit looks\u2014jeans and a sweater on another sweltering day\u2014but it doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019s always been prettier than me.</p><p>\u201cNice job you did on my locker,\u201d I say.</p><p>We stare at each other, Western-movie-showdown-style. Several agonizing seconds pass, but Anna never draws her gun, which is good, because I\u2019m totally unarmed. She turns back to the mirror and digs through the makeup bag in front of her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it.\u201d She pulls out some lip gloss. \u201cI had it done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have sex with him, Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she says. \u201cYou almost sound like you mean it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKara\u2019s lying to you. She set me up\u2014\u201d</p><p>She snorts. \u201cDon\u2019t even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. She set me up. You know she hates my guts\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dumb do you think I am, Regina? You know the part that really makes me sick?\u201d She tilts her chin up, eyes never straying from her reflection. \u201cI was right there. Did you get off on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna, he\u2014\u201d The words come out of my mouth fast and stupid, because if I think about them too much, I won\u2019t be able to say them. \u201cAnna, he tried to rape me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t go over well. She slams the gloss down and whirls around, her face as red as her hair.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you just said that.\u201d</p><p>This is the air sucked out of my lungs, this is a punch in the stomach, this is a slap across the face, and that is not what she was supposed to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your best friend,\u201d I choke out.</p><p>\u201cYou were until you fucked my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna, I didn\u2019t\u201d</p> <p>She drops the gloss back into her bag. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying it forever. You always acted like you hated him, and you tried every trick in the book to get me to break up with him, and when that didn\u2019t work, you waited. Now you\u2019re caught and you\u2019re scared and you\u2019re standing there telling me he tried to rape you? That is fucked, Regina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014I\u2019ll show\u2014I\u2019ll show you\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll show her the bruises. I fumble with my sleeves, my hands shaking horribly, while Anna zips up her bag. The washroom door swings open, interrupting me, and when I turn around, it\u2019s Kara. She looks so different. Like, confident. So this is really bad.</p><p>\u201cBell\u2019s gonna go,\u201d she says over me. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d</p><p>I turn back to Anna. She smiles at me. No, not at me\u2014through me. She\u2019s smiling at Kara, through me, but this can\u2019t be over because I haven\u2019t had my say. In the movies, you get the time to make the speech that saves your life, and everyone wants to listen to you. She hasn\u2019t even seen the bruises yet.</p><p>\u201cAnna, just wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Anna says to Kara, over me. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou hear something?\u201d Kara asks Anna, grinning.</p><p>\u201cAnna, please.\u201d Anna gives herself one last look in the mirror, grabs her makeup bag, and passes me on her way out. The air that follows her smells berry sweet, and I beg after it. \u201cAnna, Anna, Anna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Regina,\u201d she says in a singsong voice. And she leaves.</p><p>Kara doesn\u2019t. I feel her behind me; I feel every part of her enjoying this. I take Anna\u2019s place in front of the mirror, trying to ignore how sick it makes me that every part of Kara is enjoying this. I try to conjure the Regina she was afraid of. The one who put her in her place. Over and over again.</p><p>I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou talked me out of it.\u201d My voice breaks. \u201cYou told me not to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it wouldn\u2019t have done me any good if you had,\u201d she says in that same singsong voice that Anna used, and then she leaves, and I bite my lip until I taste blood.</p><p>It hurts less than what just happened here.</p><p>For the first time in four years at this school, I\u2019m aware of the cafete ria like I\u2019ve never been aware of it before. Greasy, overcrowded, hot and loud.</p><p>I can see everyone.</p><p>Those teen movies that use the cafeteria to present the social hierarchies of high school, the ones where the lunch tables become little islands, spaces for you and people like you and no one else, where the overlap is nonexistent\u2014they\u2019re all wrong. Hallowell High\u2019s cafeteria is only overlap. Cliques bleed into other cliques for lack of space, and there\u2019s only one exception: Anna\u2019s table. It\u2019s always been Anna and everyone else.</p><p>And now me.</p><p>This must be what the first day of ninth grade felt like for people who didn\u2019t have seating insurance. I scan rows of tables for an empty chair, but my gaze keeps drifting back to home base, where there are two\u2014mine and Donnie\u2019s.</p><p>They\u2019re all watching me.</p><p>Fourteen pairs of eyes track this moment where I\u2019m lost and it\u2019s obvious. I maneuver around tables with as much purpose as I can muster, pretending I\u2019ve got somewhere to be until I find somewhere to be. I end up at the table at the back, the one next to the long line of garbage cans. It\u2019s the Garbage Table. It\u2019s Michael Hayden\u2019s table. It\u2019s nearly always empty because no one likes eating next to the garbage.</p><p>No one likes eating next to Michael Hayden.</p><p>He\u2019s hunched over a burger and Coke, writing in the Moleskine he\u2019s constantly carrying around. Michael Hayden: Unstable Emo Writer Boy.</p><p>I pick at my fingernails and debate how to do this. Michael probably doesn\u2019t want me to sit with him. We have phys ed together and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s enough of me for him. It\u2019s enough of him for me, but when I look up, he\u2019s watching me. My face gets hot, but I go all fake-confidence on him and walk over. He closes the notebook and shoves it aside.</p><p>\u201cCan I sit here?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything. Doesn\u2019t look at me. I decide it\u2019s an invitation and sit. I pick my nails while he eats. I don\u2019t actually eat lunch in the traditional sense; I dig into my pockets and pull out a pill. Everyone\u2019s eyes are on me. I can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re thinking. This is Michael\u2014longish, dark brown hair that always hangs into his pale blue eyes. His face is all sharp features, and he\u2019s tall, broad shoulders, sort of built. He moved here during ninth grade, when his shrink mother decided to set up a practice in town. He came here quiet\u2014not shy, but removed, above it all. Like he just didn\u2019t care about us.</p><p>We tried to make him care. It didn\u2019t work. So first we told everyone he was a creep. Stay away. We couldn\u2019t even give a solid reason why, but because it came from Anna\u2019s mouth, that was good enough. He was a freak, and then his mother died in the eleventh grade and Anna was thrilled; she finally had a solid reason.</p><p>Michael now: We got everyone to believe his mom\u2019s death made him snap, and he\u2019s a torturing-small-animals kind of walking anger-management problem, that he\u2019s on meds, and his Moleskine holds school-shooting manifestos.</p><p>So this is going to be awkward.</p><p>I swallow the antacid dry. My throat is tight and it refuses to go down. I try again. The pill begins a slow dissolve over my tongue. I finally dredge up enough spit to force the thing down. The clock on the wall behind Michael\u2019s head tells me there are twenty minutes of lunch period left. I\u2019m not obligated to wait them out here, but a small part of me wants to do it to prove that I can.</p><p>Michael steadfastly ignores me, radiating the kind of tension that makes me want to go in on myself and stay there, until he finally looks at me and then past me.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re watching you,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep with him,\u201d I say. I don\u2019t know why. \u201cDonnie, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me like he clearly doesn\u2019t give a fuck and wants to know why I think he should. It\u2019s the kind of look that makes me feel every inch of my skin in a way that makes me want to claw it all off.</p><p>He hates me.</p><p>I twist around in my chair. The seven heads turned in my direction go back to their food, whispering. I can just guess what they\u2019re saying.</p><p>\u201cSo how come they\u2019re telling everyone you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got set up.\u201d I say it casually, but I feel every word in my gut, and it causes the kind of upset a pill can\u2019t reach. \u201cBy someone who I thought was my friend.\u201d</p><p>Except Kara was never my friend. She was just one of those girls you have to throw a bone to because there\u2019s nowhere else for them to go, and you\u2019ve known them for so long, you can\u2019t even remember how you met.</p><p>\u201cKara,\u201d I tell him, even though he didn\u2019t ask. Saying her name elicits a Pavlovian response from me. My hands twitch, overcome with the urge to strangle her to death.</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s what you get,\u201d he says.</p><p>Our eyes meet. He stares at me, and I can only take it for a second before I have to look away. He looks like his mom. \u201cShe used to be really fat,\u201d he says. \u201cKara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour point?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. I know what he\u2019s implying. I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s no secret.</p><p>Everyone knows Kara used to be fat until the second half of tenth grade, when she learned how to stick her fingers down her throat and started popping diet pills. She had to wear a wig in her class photo because she was losing her hair; you can see it if you look really closely. It was the pills or the purging. And those were only suggestions, anyway.</p><p>It\u2019s not like I told her she had to do that to herself.</p><p>Michael goes back to his burger. I try not to watch him eat, but I end up watching him eat anyway. It always amazes me how people can relax enough in this place to do that\u2014eat\u2014and not care. He finishes it off with precious minutes of the period to spare. He uses those to study me, and I get that claw-my-skin-off feeling. I know he\u2019s trying to make me feel so uncomfortable I won\u2019t come back and sit here ...</p><p>Tomorrow.</p><p>I have to do this all over again tomorrow. \u201cI knew your mom,\u201d I blurt out.</p><p>He blinks, surprised. I\u2019ve surprised him. And then his eyes light up in the strangest way\u2014like he hasn\u2019t heard the word mom in a long time. It\u2019s not exactly happy, it\u2019s sort of curious\u2014like, Mom. I know that word.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he demands.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2014\u201d For a second my head is full of her office, the way it smelted\u2014sort of like coffee\u2014and the walls were this pale blue. Her voice was soft and kind. \u201cWe were friends.\u201d</p><p>I feel bad for the lie, but it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t want it to be true. I don\u2019t know if his mom ever thought of me as anything but her patient, but I really liked her and I wish we had been friends. It\u2019s horrible, but sometimes I\u2019m relieved she died before she could ever find out what I helped do to her son. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe never mentioned you,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWe were friends,\u201d I repeat. He searches my face for the lie. I sweat it out until he concedes and says, \u201cMaybe.\u201d The bell rings.</p><p>\u201cCan I sit here with you tomorrow?\u201d I ask. It\u2019s humiliating having to ask permission to sit at the Garbage Table, and when he doesn\u2019t answer me immediately, I pose the question again with the kind of urgency that makes me sound totally pathetic. \u201cMichael, can I sit here with you tomorrow at lunch?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I said no?\u201d he asks. My mouth goes dry. You can\u2019t. The cafeteria is emptying. Ms. Nelson stands by the door, waiting for the last of us to leave, but I can\u2019t leave without this one thing and he knows it. \u201cRegina, I don\u2019t care where you sit.\u201d</p><p>He grabs his things, gets up, and makes his way out. I stay, staring at the table until Nelson blows her whistle and tells me to \u201cget out there.\u201d</p><p>BITCH.</p><p>Kara drops the note on my desk on her way to the board to do a few math problems for Mr. Brenner, and her wrist action is so subtle, he doesn\u2019t even see it and he\u2019s looking right at her. And that has everything to do with how short her skirt is.</p><p>I crush the note into a neat little ball.</p> <p>\u201cWell done,\u201d Brenner says, as Kara chalks down the answers to the last problem. He\u2019s staring at her legs like the skeeve he is. Bruce waves his hand around.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, sir? I did the problems with Kara, and she got the last one wrong.\u201d</p><p>The silence is delicious. Kara reddens and Brenner blinks, totally caught.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you got it wrong, Burton,\u201d he suggests, and waits for the rest of the class to laugh, like, Yeah, maybe. We don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it, sir,\u201d Bruce says.</p><p>That\u2019s when we laugh. Brenner tells us to be quiet, and we review the problem as a class, and sure enough, Kara got it wrong, so Brenner has to backtrack. He starts babbling about the \u201cmathematical journey\u201d and how the steps you take are sometimes more important than the destination, until he loses his ridiculous train of thought and sends Kara back to her seat.</p> <p>I stare at the crumpled note, and when she\u2019s close enough, I wind my arm back and whip it at her forehead. She shrieks and Brenner totally sees it, so it\u2019s detention for me, shelving returns in the library after school.</p><p>There\u2019s no such thing as justice.</p><p>I\u2019m in the library wedging a copy of Flowers in the Attic between two</p><p>copies of Persuasion when Liz Cooper and Charie Andrews come in. Proof positive a bad day can always get worse. I back into the narrow shelves until I\u2019m out of sight and they pass by, talking low, and end up in the stacks directly behind me. Charie is a total no one, but Liz is this faded-out yellow-haired girl-ghost I\u2019ve gone to elaborate lengths to avoid because being around her makes my stomach ache. I reach into my pocket and force an antacid between my lips, chewing it in hopes that will make it work faster.</p><p>They\u2019re talking about me, of course. I\u2019d be shocked if they weren\u2019t. I get as close to the books as I can and hope they don\u2019t see me spying on them through the shelves. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m eavesdropping. They won\u2019t say anything I want to hear.</p><p>\u201cDonnie didn\u2019t even show today,\u201d Charie is saying.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably out getting wasted,\u201d Liz replies, and she\u2019s probably right. For Donnie, sobriety is a fate worse than his inevitable death from liver failure.</p><p>\u201cDid you see her looking for somewhere to sit at lunch? It was totally hilarious. I kept hoping she\u2019d come over and ask if she could sit with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could tell her no.\u201d Charie laughs because it\u2019s totally hilarious. Liz doesn\u2019t laugh, but I almost wish she would. It\u2019s always easier when the people you\u2019ve ruined decide to really hate you\u2014like Michael does\u2013because then your defenses go up and you can\u2019t even really feel the bad things you\u2019ve done. \u201cShe sat with Michael,\u201d Liz says.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s too nice.\u201d Charie\u2019s voice is all disappointment. \u201cI caught up with him in history and asked him if she was really upset, but he said she seemed normal. It has to be a front, though, right? She gets kicked out of her clique and they all hate her and Josh dumped her\u2013\u201d I jerk back. I don\u2019t remember that part happening. \u201c...She\u2019ll be slitting her wrists soon enough.\u201d</p><p>I swallow. I swallow again. I don\u2019t know what feels worse: Josh breaking up with me without breaking up with me, Charie joking about my suicide, or Liz\u2019s gentle admonition of it\u2014\u201cCharie, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it could happen,\u201d Charie says. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ve got to catch Paul. See you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you.\u201d</p><p>Charie flits by my shelves. I wait while Liz rifles through book after book after book after book. After a while, she settles at a table nearby and opens up a paperback. I lean against the shelf and close my eyes. I\u2019m trapped here until she leaves. Facing her is not an option.</p><p>\u201cRegina,\u201d she says, and my heart stops. I open my eyes and she\u2019s staring in my direction. \u201cI know you\u2019re there. You can come out.\u201d</p><p>I step out slowly. She looks me over, starting at my feet and working her way up to my eyes. I have to force myself to hold her gaze. I don\u2019t like looking Liz in the eyes. It\u2019s stupid, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll see her like the last time I really saw her. Totally broken. I mean, I still see that on her\u2014everyone does. It\u2019ll be all over her until she graduates.</p><p>But I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll see it now like I saw it then.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to say anything?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cWhat would I have to say to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just thought you\u2019d enjoy this, is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d have anything to say to you.\u201d</p><p>The moment should end here, but I\u2019m rooted to the spot. I stare at the literacy poster tacked on the wall behind her head. \u201cRead or die.\u201d I feel like I should be saying something important, but the chance for that has passed. A long time ago.</p><p>\u201cThe locker was impressive,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat do you think they\u2019ll do next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. \u201cGuess you\u2019ll have to tune in to find out.\u201d</p><p>She closes her book. \u201cWell, I\u2019m here every day. But I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s kind of boring. I\u2019ve seen this show before. I totally starred in it once. Remember?\u201d</p><p>A familiar, horrible feeling consumes me. I want to tell her it wasn\u2019t easy for me, either, watching Anna torture her every day until the light in her eyes went out. I want to tell her, but that would be dumb.</p><p>\u201cGot any tips?\u201d I try to keep my voice light.</p><p>She laughs a little. It\u2019s been ages since I heard her laugh and mean it, and even though it\u2019s at my expense, and for a minute it\u2019s so familiar it\u2019s like we\u2019re in her room, giggling about things that don\u2019t mean anything, a really happy moment until Anna would call her cell phone, looking for me.</p><p>\u201cGood luck, Regina,\u201d Liz says. \u201cYou\u2019ll need it.\u201d</p><p>Tuesday, after school</p><p>The night air is thick with heat, awful. Every breath in is stale and gross. I\u2019m starting to think this weather will never break. We\u2019ll just choke on it and die.</p><p>Josh\u2019s house is strange and lonely looking when it\u2019s not the backdrop for the crazy parties that have made him legend around the halls of Hallowell High. The front lawn is a broad green brushstroke, and the house itself, a picture out of a magazine\u2014tasteful, but flat. I walk the stone path to the front door and push the doorbell.</p><p>He answers in boxers and a T-shirt, his blond hair tousled. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, taking me in. \u201cNo way. I have nothing to say to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shove my sandaled foot in the door at the exact same time he closes it, hard. I yelp and jump back, sucking in a breath through my teeth before the pain hits, and then it hits. Fuck. He opens the door, his mouth hanging open like a total idiot. Fuck him. I turn and hobble back down the walk.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you put your foot there?\u201d he demands.</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want you to shut the door in my face!\u201d</p><p>I sit on the steps leading to the driveway and rub my foot, tears in my eyes. Josh walks over and stares me down, looking every inch the asshole that he\u2019s turned out to be. The saddest part is, it\u2019s not even that much of a surprise. Josh is stupid-smart. Knowing him, he probably severed all emotional ties to me when I stopped being his girlfriend and started being a social liability.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks, like it\u2019s the last thing he wants to ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, good. Now get off my property.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cAre you kidding me? You\u2019re not even going to hear me out?\u201d</p><p>His cell vibrates in his pocket. He takes it out, glances at the screen, and sighs. \u201cLynn Parks wants Adderall for resale because the other girls are too scared to buy from me, even though it\u2019d be cheaper.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI could get these retards Percocet and they just want Adderall.\u201d</p><p>That is not the thing he should be saying.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Josh.\u201d I get to my feet. \u201cYou totally\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shoves his cell back in his pocket. \u201cOkay, okay. Regina, just\u2014wait. I\u2019ll hear you out, Jesus. What, did you think I\u2019d be happy to see you after you fucked Donnie?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t sleep with him. The words are stopped by a dead-sick feeling in the middle of my chest. I didn\u2019t sleep with him, he tried to rape me. I open my mouth and close it again, while Josh stares at me expectantly, waiting for me to speak.</p><p>But I can\u2019t.</p><p>In the washroom with Anna, it made sense to just blurt it out; I didn\u2019t have a lot of time. But Josh is, like...not Anna. I need to think of a way to say it that doesn\u2019t betray the feel of Donnie on me.</p><p>\u201cHe tried to...Donnie tried to...\u201d</p><p>My tongue gets too thick to talk around. A tear slides down my cheek. I wipe it away. I don\u2019t want to cry in front of Josh. \u201cTears? Come on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I recoil. \u201cI can\u2019t believe what a total dick you\u2019re being. You\u2019re going to feel so stupid when I tell you what really happened\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen hurry up and tell me, because I haven\u2019t got all night\u2014\u201d A car goes by, interrupting him. He lets it interrupt him. That\u2019s how little this means to him. And then his cell goes off again and he checks it. \u201cIt\u2019s Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer,\u201d I say. \u201cJosh, don\u2019t answer\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust wait a second. I have to take this and then we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d I storm down the driveway. He calls after me once, and that\u2019s it. By the time I\u2019ve hit the street, I can hear the faint strains of his conversation with Anna.</p><p>I jog down the street, trying to outrun the feeling building inside my stomach, until I can\u2019t, and then I pick up antacids at Ford\u2019s Convenience Store. They\u2019re in the fourth aisle down and seventeen steps in. I make the switch from Generic Brand J to Generic Brand K, super-strength, because I don\u2019t think the old ones are really working anymore.</p><p>They all stop working after a while.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Anna-just talk to me, please\u201d</p><p>I stretch, touching my toes. It\u2019s gym. It\u2019s too hot out to instruct, so Nelson tells us to do what we want. All the boys are playing basketball on one side of the room, and the girls are on gym mats, occasionally offering the illusion of movement, because we\u2019re smarter than the boys. I\u2019m trying to block out the voice behind me. It\u2019s uncomfortably close and it belongs to Donnie. He\u2019s squatting next to Anna\u2019s mat and begging for her time, to get her to hear him out. She\u2019s enjoying it, but she\u2019s not about to give him anything. It\u2019s all in her voice when she says, \u201cGo to hell, Donnie.\u201d</p> <p>Kara giggles beside her. Before he made his way over, they spent the period whispering the words slut, whore, and bitch in my direction. Anna has also decided to torment me with fashion sameness. Today they\u2019re all wearing blue. I\u2019m wearing green.</p><p>I felt stupid passing them in the hall.</p><p>Donnie lowers his voice. \u201cWe need to talk\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>She says it loud enough that it carries across the gym, and I can\u2019t help it. I turn and look. Donnie has his arm on her shoulder, a tight grip. I can see his fingers digging into her shirt. If it hurts, it\u2019s not on Anna\u2019s face. She\u2019s cool, disinterested. All eyes are on the two of them. She doesn\u2019t waver, but he\u2019s already shrinking. His face turns red, and his gaze shifts to me, and I edge away. I always waver. I spot Kara smirking out of the corner of my eye.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d Nelson calls across the gym.</p> <p>Anna won\u2019t speak for him. Donnie lets go of her shoulder and stands, trying to recover the moment. He straightens and walks past, pausing almost imperceptibly when he gets near me. I\u2019m the last person in this school he can intimidate. And I hate that I\u2019m the last person in this school he can intimidate. As soon as he\u2019s across the room, I get up and head over to the corner, stretching my hands over my head, trying to look casual, but my fingers are tingling and I can\u2019t breathe. Kara and Anna laugh. I can hear them laughing.</p><p>I inhale slowly.</p><p>When I face the gym, I spot Michael. He\u2019s sitting on the bench, hunched over, hands dangling between his legs, fresh off the court and taking a breather. His hair clings to his sweaty forehead, and he pulls the collar of his shirt up and wipes his face. Then he pauses and our eyes meet.</p><p>Josh jogs between us, momentarily obscuring our view, and when it\u2019s clear again, Michael\u2019s watching the game. I\u2019m about to head back to my mat, but I stay back when I see Josh talking to Anna. Their heads are ducked together. Anna glances across the gym and tells him something. He nods and goes back to the game, beckoning to Michael to take center and sending Jack Olson to the side. I head to my mat and try to find the will to pretend like I\u2019m doing something and none of this bothers me.</p><p>It takes, like, ten minutes.</p><p>\u201cGODDAMMIT, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE\u201d</p><p>The shout cuts through the hustle and bustle, and everyone stops what they\u2019re doing and turns their attention halfway across the gym, to where a few guys are huddled around Donnie. Ms. Nelson blows her whistle and hurries over.</p><p>Even from here, I can see the blood.</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d Kara says behind me. \u201cNicely done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Anna says. She makes her way over to the scene, Kara trailing behind her. Donnie\u2019s still screaming, clutching his nose. I wait a second and I go, too.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Henderson,\u201d Nelson says over Donnie\u2019s shouts. She tries pulling his hand away from his face, but he won\u2019t budge. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>Donnie wrenches away from her, and his hand comes down, revealing a bloody mess. His nose and the area under his right eye is swollen and angry, painful.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking elbowed me in the fucking face on fucking purpose, Josh!\u201d Droplets of blood go flying everywhere. \u201cFuck you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMouth, Henderson!\u201d</p><p>Donnie\u2019s hand goes back to his nose. His shoulders heave, and the parts of his face not covered in blood are a matching, apoplectic red. Everyone turns to Josh, who stands outside of it all, looking vaguely annoyed.</p><p>\u201cYes, Donnie, I elbowed you in the face. On purpose.\u201d He says it like it\u2019s a completely preposterous idea, like people don\u2019t elbow people in the face on purpose, in the history of mankind. Ever. A few people chuckle, and he goes in for the kill: \u201cIt was an accident, man. You got in the way.\u201d</p><p>I try to let the blood that\u2019s still gushing from Donnie\u2019s nose fill me up, but then Nelson blows her whistle again and the moment is over and it\u2019s not enough. It\u2019s nowhere near enough.</p><p>And it just means I\u2019m next.</p><p>\u201cBrooks, escort Henderson to the nurse\u2019s office. The rest of you, back to what you were doing. There\u2019s still twenty minutes of this period left!\u201d</p><p>We scatter back to where we\u2019re supposed to be. Josh winks at Anna.</p><p>I want to punch him in the face.</p><p>Getting to the Garbage Table is easier this time .</p><p>Anna, Kara, Marta, and Jeanette aren\u2019t around. Off-campus lunch. We liked to break out at least once a week, so they\u2019ll all be clustered around a McTable in matching outfits without me. I sit across from Michael; I\u2019ve brought a drink to wash my antacid down, and he\u2019s got juice and a salad. The cafeteria noises are all around us, but they don\u2019t seem to touch the quiet settling here. I know he hates me, but I can\u2019t believe he doesn\u2019t have anything to say about what happened in gym. It\u2019s a big deal.</p><p>I watch him eat while he looks everywhere but at me. I used to be able to eat here. Ninth grade. Did it without a thought. Food, lunch. It didn\u2019t mean anything.</p><p>And then Liz happened.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can stand sitting back here,\u201d I say. He doesn\u2019t respond. Still doesn\u2019t look at me. \u201cEvery day. Who wants to sit alone at lunch?\u201d</p><p>He takes a long swig of his orange juice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I had a choice,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to be alone like you are.\u201d</p><p>He thinks he insulted me, like I should be above codependence in this wilderness, but here\u2019s how it is: Lunch with Michael is the new thing I\u2019ll cling to, the only thing keeping me from getting totally eaten alive. Before that, Anna kept me safe from people like him. My life has become the art of putting things between me and the people who hate me. Yes, I\u2019m afraid to be alone.</p><p>Who would hold that against you in high school.</p><p>He stabs a few leafy greens onto his fork and shoves them into his mouth. I take the opportunity to study him further. His hair is a little damp, and any sweaty vestiges of gym are off him. He hit the shower and he looks good. He glances up and catches me staring at him. For a second, I swear he knows what I\u2019m thinking. I blush and look away.</p><p>This is dumb.</p><p>\u201cSo you knew my mom, huh?\u201d he asks, and it\u2019s a relief to have him ask because it means we have to talk to each other, and that\u2019s better than him staring at me or not staring at me and chewing food and not saying anything.</p><p>I nod. \u201cWe were friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I have a really hard time believing that,\u201d he says, \u201cso tell me something a friend of hers would know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so hard to believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re so afraid to be alone. I think you\u2019ll say anything to sit with me at lunch.\u201d</p><p>I think of his mother. I try to think of something that would make him believe we were friends. I trace circles on the table with my finger and picture her face. She had light brown hair\u2014not like him\u2014and light blue eye\u2014like him\u2014and she was my doctor, but she was a person, too, and she liked...</p><p>\u201cShe loved Gary Larson\u2019s comic, The Far Side. She thought he was\u2014\u201d I try to remember how she put it. \u201c\u2014Twisted. That\u2019s how I found out about Gary Larson. Your mom. Because she really liked him.\u201d</p><p>His face darkens. He hates and loves what I just said. He loves that I said it, but he hates that I\u2019m the one who said it. He picks at the label of his orange juice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she did,\u201d he says.</p><p>Chunks of broken concrete. A hint of a car underneath. The person inside is crushed to death. The person inside is Michael\u2019s mom. Overpass collapse.</p><p>It was all over the news.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d I tell him. \u201cThat she died...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. I wonder what it\u2019s like having a dead parent\u2014how he can walk around under the weight of that kind of grief. My parents are useless, but I can\u2019t imagine either of them not being here, being useless.</p><p>\u201cShe did like The Far Side, though, you\u2019re right.\u201d The skepticism in his voice remains. \u201cHow did you two meet?\u201d</p><p>She liked reading. I take my cue from that: \u201cLibrary.\u201d</p><p>He nods slowly, a million miles away, absorbing this. I guess I pass, because he doesn\u2019t press it or demand any more specifics. Another tense, awkward silence falls between us. Awkward for me. I wonder how many more times I\u2019ll have to sit here before the tension dissipates. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d probably have to forget he hates me for that to happen.</p><p>I look around the cafeteria. Josh, Henry, and Bruce are laughing obnoxiously together. Josh looks so proud of himself for what he did to Donnie.</p><p>I turn back to Michael. His Moleskine catches my eye, triggering a memory. Eager to fill the silence, I start babbling more things I know about his mom, just so I can hear him say something back. I bet if I talked about her enough he\u2019d forget he hates me.</p> <p>\u201cShe was really big on writing things down,\u201d I say. I nod at the Moleskine. \u201cIs that why you keep that thing? She always used to say, \u2018Write it down today, put it away, make sense of it tomorrow.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she always used to say that to her patients,\u201d he says, nodding. Oh my God, Oh no. Why did I say that? It dawns on him slowly, horribly. His eyes widen and he laughs in disbelief. \u201cYou have got to be fucking kidding me.\u201d</p><p>My face turns red.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou were one of her patients?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say quickly. I don\u2019t know what else to say, but I really don\u2019t want to eat lunch alone tomorrow. \u201cMichael, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWere you one of her patients?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I fucked this up this badly and so quickly. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d I nod feebly.</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew you were lying. I couldn\u2019t figure out how a bitch like you would know my mother, much less be friends with her.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip and dig my fingers into my jeans and try to channel Anna so he can\u2019t see how much that one hurt.</p><p>\u201cYou were her patient. Why?\u201d I shake my head. I\u2019m not giving him anything else to throw in my face. \u201cSo when you saw my mom for whatever you saw her for, did you tell her you were spreading vicious rumors all over school about her son? Did that come up during your sessions? I\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve loved it.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then she died, and you\u2014\u201d He edges his chair back, like he can\u2019t stand being this close to me. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re sitting across from me....\u201d He just can\u2019t believe it. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you needed, but you didn\u2019t deserve to get it from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed help.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a disgusted look and gets up from the table. My heart seizes. He can\u2019t leave me here. Alone. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t owe you anything,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAnd forget about sitting here tomorrow. Stay away from me. I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>He stalks out of the cafeteria. I fight the heat working its way up to my face. I get up fake-casually, grateful Anna and Kara aren\u2019t around to see this, and decide to wait out the rest of lunch in history class, which is where I\u2019m due next. I walk the mostly deserted halls to my red locker, yank the door open, and\u2014</p><p>My books are gone.</p><p>All of them.</p><p>There\u2019s an envelope taped to the inside of the door. My name is scrawled on the front in loopy, cutesy handwriting. I rip it off and open it up. Written on stationery that\u2019s decorated with cartoon stars\u2014 Kara\u2019s stationery\u2014is the word pool.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t supposed to get this until after lunch, when I\u2019d. have to scramble for my books in front of everyone.</p><p>Small mercies.</p><p>I crumple the note and make my way to the pool. At lunch, nothing happens here. It\u2019s off-limits. Two week\u2019s detention if you\u2019re caught anywhere near it unsupervised, since drowned students don\u2019t reflect so well on the administration. My only obstacle should be getting past Sadowsky\u2019s office, but he\u2019s probably enjoying a nap in the teacher\u2019s lounge about now. I push through the doors and find my books drifting across the water. I grab the skimmer and fish them out quickly. My notes are pulp. The damaged textbooks will have to be paid for and replaced.</p><p>I gather everything in my arms and get the hell out. Perfect timing; I pass Sadowsky in the halls. The books soak through the front of my shirt and trail water behind me, but all he says is, \u201cGet to class Afton, or do you want another detention this week?\u201d</p><p>Teachers never go out of their way to notice anything.</p><p>Anna, Kara, Jeanette, and Marta spend the day stalking me in yellow.</p><p>They\u2019re always in the background and they always disappear when I try to get a closer look. The dumb thing is, I used to do this to other girls. I know how it works. No one ever goes in for the kill, but I still can\u2019t keep my heart from trying to claw its way up my throat every time I glimpse them.</p><p>Between classes is open season. I get stared at. I get muttered insults, spewed insults, shoved, and laughed at.</p><p>I am a bitch whore slut.</p><p>These names attach themselves to me in the halls, flutter away during class, and reattach themselves as soon as the bell rings.</p><p>I\u2019m between first and second period, my head ducked, clutching my books and weaving through the hall like an idiot, which is okay as long as I don\u2019t have to look anyone in the eyes. I end up crashing into Henry Carlson. He grabs me by the arm and doesn\u2019t let go. He\u2019s alone. No Josh, no Bruce, no Anna. But Anna\u2019s always here, even when she\u2019s not.</p><p>\u201cBetter watch it, Afton,\u201d he says, grinning. I jerk my arm away, and he frowns, like I\u2019ve wounded him. \u201cOuch. What\u2019s the rush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a class to get to.\u201d I try to step around him, and he blocks my path. I sigh and level a glare at him, like any look I give him could make him submit. \u201cGet out of my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give me a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry, I\u2019m warning you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He catches sight of something behind me, and before I can turn to look, he grabs me by the shoulders and forces me back, a light push that startles me enough to send me reeling into a wall of flesh. The wall of flesh shoves me back. I drop my books, turn, and find myself face-to-face with Donnie Henderson. He grabs me by the arm and pulls me close enough to say, \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for talking.\u201d</p><p>All I can see is his wrecked face. There\u2019s nothing else. My vision blurs, like my eyes are totally rejecting him, can\u2019t handle it. I wrench away, and as soon as his hand is off me, the hall comes back into focus. People are watching.</p><p>They all think I slept with him.</p><p>They all think I wanted it.</p><p>Donnie stomps away. Henry hangs around to laugh at his handiwork, a picture of lazy triumph. I grab my books and head in the opposite direction and the bell rings, and all I can think is next, next, next, next class.</p><p>By lunch, I\u2019m a mess. I spend the period in the girls\u2019 room with a bag of chips from the vending machine, but I can\u2019t eat.</p><p>I roll up my sleeves and stare at what\u2019s left of my bruises.</p><p>I want to run away and I never want to come back.</p><p>When the last bell signals freedom, I\u2019m on edge. Spent. I get my stuff from my locker\u2014warped history books and all\u2014and push through a flood of students.</p><p>Totally alone.</p><p>I\u2019m halfway down the stairs when someone pushes me from behind. I lurch forward and I\u2019m flying, steps blurring past. I land at the bottom of them with a sick thud. The pain is immediate. So is the laughter. It comes in from all sides, and I stay on the floor, surrounded by it. It\u2019s amazing how one day you wake up and this is your life.</p><p>I am not going to cry.</p><p>\u201cWay to walk, Regina.\u201d</p><p>I look up. Kara. Anna. Jeanette. Bruce. Josh. Josh averts his eyes, and Anna grins and she\u2019s gone; Kara whisks her away. They low-five. Josh and Bruce follow after them. I am not going to cry.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Ms. Arnett, the school\u2019s secretary, materializes in the middle of the crowd and hurries over to me, her face full of wrinkly concern. \u201cThat was a nasty fall you took, Regina! Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I mutter. She pulls me up by the elbow and looks me over. My left knee aches, and a small patch of blood is soaking through my jeans.</p><p>\u201cOh, but you\u2019re bleeding. Come to the office and we\u2019ll get\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shrug her off me. \u201cI said I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me with her watery blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell...,\u201d she says, \u201cif you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>I hobble away from Arnett, everyone, and push through the front doors. The warm air envelops me, and my head is full of the fall and after the fall: the stairs, my palms pressed against the floor, Anna, Kara, Josh. Way to walk, Regina. Arnett. As soon as I\u2019m out of the parking lot and onto the street, I stop. I just stop.</p><p>I think of the year stretched out before me like a tunnel, and I see myself in it, awake and running.</p><p>A car pulls up to the curb and snaps me back to life. I resume my stilted walk home. Ten steps later, I notice the car is keeping pace with me. I have this crazy thought it\u2019s Anna and Kara and they\u2019re going to egg me or something, but when I look, it\u2019s only Michael in the shoddy blue Saturn he drives to school every day. The window is rolled down, and his arm hangs out the side, casual. He taps his fingers along the door, dividing his gaze between the road and me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a ride home,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKara pushed you.\u201d I ignore him. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want a ride?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s tempting: It\u2019s hot and gross out, and my knee hurts. But I won\u2019t. Not after what happened in the cafeteria yesterday. I force myself to keep going, and he keeps creeping alongside me in the car. I squint up at the sun.</p><p>\u201cDo you have air-conditioning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few things in this wreck that works.\u201d</p><p>Michael rolls up his window as I walk around to the passenger\u2019s side and get in. It\u2019s really weird to think that not that long ago, this would be Josh\u2019s car and I\u2019d be sitting in it.</p><p>Michael pulls away from the curb. \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep going down this road, past the phone booth. It\u2019s the second left turn, seven houses down. You\u2019ll see it. It\u2019s the first brick house.\u201d</p><p>I run my hand over my knee. It\u2019s stopped bleeding. \u201cI was so sure you\u2019d go crawling back to them by now,\u201d he comments. \u201cI\u2019m amazed you have any pride.\u201d I don\u2019t say anything for a minute. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re sure of a lot of things.\u201d I eye the Moleskine resting on the dash. \u201cAll you do is watch us and write.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s afraid.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cBut no one more than you.\u201d I point. \u201cThat\u2019s my house.\u201d</p><p>He eases the car to a halt and lets it idle while I sit there and try to think of something to say, but I can\u2019t. I get out of the car and step back into the heat, stand on the curb, and watch him pull out. As soon as the Saturn is a speck in the distance, I roll up the leg of my jeans and inspect the damage. Superficial wound.</p><p>It still really stings, though.</p><p>I\u2019m in the girls\u2019 washroom when Kara comes in. She\u2019s in red.</p><p>Today they\u2019re wearing red.</p> <p>She takes her place beside me, and our eyes meet in the mirrors. I rinse the lather from my hands and watch the suds swirl down the drain. I turn the water off and reach for the paper towels resting in a nearby puddle of water. Kara pushes the soap dispenser and lets the electric green liquid gush onto the cheap plastic counter below.</p><p>I just want to kill her. I\u2019ve never felt a more honest urge in my</p><p>life.</p><p>\u201cYou look like shit,\u201d she says. \u201cIt suits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for this,\u201d I tell her. It\u2019s an empty threat. Empty threats and the strong urge to bash her head against the pavement\u2014the only two things I seem to have these days. They\u2019re better than nothing.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d Kara says. Her eyes light up. \u201cHey, I never said thank you, did I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s so fucked up. Do you even get what Donnie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I should thank him, too. It\u2019s like winning the lottery. I couldn\u2019t believe you actually thought I\u2019d want to help you after everything you\u2019ve done to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a lot nicer to you than I could\u2019ve been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she interrupts. \u201cYou weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>We stare at each other. There\u2019s always this one girl. She\u2019s desperate and she\u2019s weird and she\u2019s jealous, and you\u2019re stuck with her, no matter how hard you try to get her off your back. Just throw some really fucked-up self-esteem issues into the mix and you have Kara. She could never keep up with us, and she knew it. And we knew it. And she was fat. Our relationship is as simple as it is complicated. I played messenger for Anna one too many times.</p><p>And I guess I enjoyed it more than I should have.</p><p>\u201cThe best part about all of this\u2014\u201d she stops for a second, unable to contain herself. \u201cIs how awesomely Anna sold you out. I thought she\u2019d hold back a little, but she told me everything. I never had anything on you before\u2014nothing she\u2019d let me get away with using\u2014 but now...it\u2019s going to be a great year, Regina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait until she finds out you lied to her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen. And what are you going to do about it, anyway? It\u2019s not like you can rally the troops. You have no one. Well, except Donnie. Maybe he\u2019ll have you.\u201d</p><p>She leaves. I\u2019m a volcano. Something inside me snaps, and next thing I know, I\u2019m in the hall and Kara\u2019s there, meandering, and all I can think about is how much I want her to hurt.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t see me coming until it\u2019s too late. I shove her and she yelps, and I shove her again, into a row of lockers. The sound she makes as she hits them is nice\u2014it\u2019s so nice\u2014that I shove her again. She tries to shove back, but I\u2019m too quick. Another bang against the locker. Her head. A crowd assembles behind us and I know they\u2019re thinking Fight! even if they never say it. I can feel it coming off them and me; I\u2019m adrenaline.</p><p>I\u2019ll give them a fight.</p><p>But before I can make another move, I\u2019m pulled back.</p><p>There are hands on me and they\u2019re pulling me back.</p><p>\u201cGet off her, Regina! Jesus, what the fuck are you doing?!\u201d</p><p>The comedown is fast, intense. It\u2019s over. I\u2019m suddenly aware of how noisy the halls are, that people are talking loudly, and they\u2019re pointing at me.</p><p>They all look surprised.</p><p>\u201cCrazy bitch,\u201d one of them mutters.</p><p>The hands that are on me belong to Josh. Kara\u2019s pressed up against the locker looking like I\u2019ve done exactly what I just did. Her face is red and her hair is everywhere. I shove Josh away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKara\u2014oh, my God, Kara, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Anna pushes through the crowd and starts fussing over Kara, who points at me, panting. Anna doesn\u2019t miss a beat and marches over, livid. Josh moves, positioning himself beside her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your problem, Regina?\u201d</p><p>I glare past the edges of Anna\u2019s red hair, to Kara, because I\u2019m too afraid to look at her, and then she grabs me by the chin and makes me do it. I grab her wrist, get her hand off me. Big mistake. She raises her other hand like she\u2019s going to slap me. She doesn\u2019t, but the threat is enough to make me flinch, and the whole, hall goes quiet.</p><p>We stare at each other. I jerk away.</p><p>My problem, my problem, what\u2019s my problem?</p><p>I walk away from all of them, turning corner after corner until I end up in a deserted hallway with doors that offshoot into nowhere rooms. The fight that almost was feels like a memory already, like it didn\u2019t even happen, and I\u2019m numb all over except for my stomach, which is just acid, so I take an antacid, even though what I really want to do is scream until I can\u2019t scream anymore.</p><p>\u201cRegina?\u201d</p><p>Michael. He startles me. He must have seen the whole thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I have to fight every part of myself to let that simple word come out of my mouth, because I really, really want to scream. \u201cWhat do you want, Michael?\u201d</p><p>He blinks, taken aback. \u201cJesus, just forget it.\u201d</p><p>I watch him stalk back down the hall. I stand there alone until the urge to scream disappears, and then I decide to follow after him, because he can\u2019t just tell me to forget it and walk away.</p><p>He has to know I\u2019m trailing him, but he doesn\u2019t look back. He keeps walking until he finally forces his way through the front doors and steps outside. Leaving. He\u2019s left. That\u2019s a really good idea. I glance over my shoulder for teachers. None.</p><p>I step through the door, and the heat is instantly on me.</p><p>Michael\u2019s already halfway across the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cMichael! Michael, wait!\u201d He stops. By the time I reach him, I\u2019m already sticky with sweat. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d he says.</p><p>Home. I could go home, to my place. No one\u2019s there. I glance back at the school. I can actually see the heat coming off of it. And I hate the people inside.</p><p>\u201cCan I come with you?\u201d I beg. He looks like he\u2019s about to tell me to fuck off, but I cut him off. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>He turns and heads for his car. I follow him.</p><p>He lets me.</p><p>Michael lives near the outskirts of town .</p><p>It\u2019s an old house. The painted exterior is flaking away, and the front porch looks tired. The wooden fences that separate it from nicer homes on either side are in desperate need of repair. He didn\u2019t always live here. He used to live in a bungalow a few streets over, and then his mom died. I always figured it was one of those situations where he and his dad couldn\u2019t stand being where she\u2019d been, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true.</p><p>I thought it once and I\u2019ve tried not to think about it since.</p><p>Michael gets out of the car. I do the same. Now that school is behind us, the whole situation feels less dire and kind of stupid, like I shouldn\u2019t have come here. I wipe my palms on my shorts, and Michael gestures for me to follow him. We bypass the front door and edge down a narrow path of dried-out yellow grass between the fence and the house that leads into the backyard.</p><p>Where there\u2019s a pool.</p><p>It\u2019s in-ground. A quietly neglected piece of paradise. A few leaves float across the surface of the water. There are two chaise lounges at the side and worn-out wicker furniture taking up space on the patio. A sliding door leads inside.</p><p>Michael pushes open the back door. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>I wonder if he will be. While he\u2019s inside, I meander around the pool. I get it. It\u2019s like neutral ground. It\u2019s as close to inside as I\u2019m getting, and that suits me fine. I entertain a visual of us in his house, on a couch, side by side or something, and it\u2019s parental-inspection-on-prom-night shades of weird. Not that this isn\u2019t weird.</p><p>I spot a fly floating on the surface of the water, its little legs pumping madly as it fights to keep itself afloat: I know that feeling. I roll up my sleeves, cup it into my hands, and seek out the least-dead patch of grass I can find. I set it down and it stays there, stunned. It\u2019s still not moving when Michael returns with three bottles and two glasses. He sets them on the table. Coke, Jack, vodka. He faces me, and I try to ignore how much I understand what he just did. At Josh\u2019s parties, I was usually the first to start drinking and the last to stop, and it wasn\u2019t because I enjoyed the taste.</p><p>It was because I hated the people I was around.</p><p>He half turns to me. \u201cSo why\u2019d you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe deserved it,\u201d I say.</p><p>Michael mixes two Jack and Cokes and hands me the first. I halve the glass quickly and then I polish it off. I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s impressed or not. He takes a generous drink from his own glass, and his expression never changes.</p><p>It makes me feel even more awkward than I already do.</p><p>\u201cMy dad keeps his liquor cabinet locked,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He sets his glass on the table and wanders over to the edge of the pool. He rolls up his jeans and sits down, dangling his bare legs in the chlorinated water. He doesn\u2019t invite me to join him, and I feel dumb about that, too, so I pour myself a shot of vodka, knock it back, and then I just go for it. I sit next to him, cross-legged, and try not to look as tense as I feel.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your arms?\u201d Michael asks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look down.

I roll down my sleeves, until I realize the act of hiding them will inspire more questions.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you were seeing my mom?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYeah, totally. I punch myself in the arms a lot. It\u2019s a real problem.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t say anything, and I wonder if his mom actually did see people who punched themselves in the arms a lot, and then I feel really stupid. And then I figure if I feel this stupid, I might as well go double or nothing:</p><p>\u201cSo can I sit with you at lunch on Monday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He gets to his feet. The way he moves is so light, easy. I\u2019m jealous of how he walks around school with everyone thinking these horrible things about him, like it doesn\u2019t mean anything. I can barely maintain eye contact anymore.</p><p>He grabs the vodka and takes a long sip from it. When he\u2019s finished, he wipes his mouth and contemplates the bottle, and there\u2019s something so beautiful and lonely about it that I almost wish I had a camera. I shake the thought away. He sets the bottle down and returns to his spot beside me. Dips his legs back in.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll you give me for it?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I stare. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo sit with me at lunch on Monday? What will you give me for it?\u201d</p><p>I flip him off. He laughs. I guess I could hide in the washroom for the rest of the year, but I don\u2019t know. It\u2019d be nice to make Anna think that I had an ally. The illusion of someone being on my side. I reach into my pocket for an antacid and shove it in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe I should stop putting dents in my crappy reputation. It\u2019s bad enough being a waster, but it\u2019s a thousand times worse being a waster who hangs out with Regina Afton, right?\u201d</p> <p>I ignore that. \u201cYou want to know why I was seeing your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy else do you think I let you come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess. If you guess right, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>He leans back and stares at the sky. \u201cI can\u2019t. I have you mostly pegged, but I just can\u2019t figure out why you of all people would need my mom\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have me pegged,\u201d I repeat.</p><p>He nods. \u201cYou\u2019re Anna Morrison\u2019s right hand. That\u2019s the lowest form of life on the highest part of the social ladder. There\u2019s not much to you.\u201d He straightens before I can reply. \u201cOkay, let me try: Your dealer ex-boyfriend got you hooked on Adderall, and shrink visits were part of your recovery process.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cWow, got it in one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably something boring like an eating disorder.\u201d</p> <p>My stomach lurches. I don\u2019t want to talk about this with him anymore. \u201cForget it. I\u2019m not telling you even if it means I have to sit alone every day for the rest of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to your classes,\u201d he says, looking at me.</p><p>I stare at him. He\u2019s serious. He\u2019ll let me sit with him and he\u2019ll walk me to my classes if I tell him why I was seeing his mom. My fingers tingle\u2014some kind of physical response to let me know this is a deal that\u2019s too good to pass up, and before I\u2019ve even really decided to tell him, I\u2019m telling him, just spewing it out: \u201cI couldn\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I was right.\u201d He sounds disappointed. \u201cEating disorder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an eating disorder,\u201d I say. He raises an eyebrow and I flush, trying to figure out a way to explain it. \u201cI wanted to eat and I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Everyone thought it was an eating disorder, at first, and that\u2019s when Kara really started hating me. It drove her crazy every time Anna slid half her lunch to me looking all concerned. When I stopped eating, people cared.</p><p>\u201cI went to a bunch of doctors, and they couldn\u2019t find anything physically wrong me ...so I started seeing your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can eat now?\u201d</p><p>I think of the pills in my pocket. \u201cMostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you just woke up one day and you couldn\u2019t eat anymore? Really?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>Liz is out. I put my hand in the water and try to ignore that voice in my head. Liz is out. I remember waking up that Monday, sitting down at the table for breakfast, and ending up over the sink, puking. I thought it was nerves. I thought it would go away.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat was the reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s between me and your mom,\u201d I say, but it\u2019s a lie. I never told her why I couldn\u2019t eat, even though I knew. I just fed her half-truths because she was so warm and I wanted her to like me more than I wanted her to help me. And she would\u2019ve never liked me if she\u2019d known. \u201cSo can I sit with you or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But thanks.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. He stares back, a small smile at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think was going to happen? I hate going to school and you\u2019re the reason why. Just think about that for a minute and then tell me if you\u2019re still shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be like that for you,\u201d I snap. \u201cYou think about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry that I came to Hallowell and forgot to genuflect in front of your best friend,\u201d he snaps back. \u201cNot that it makes a difference. Liz Cooper was on her knee for Anna all the time, and it didn\u2019t do her any favors in the end, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you want to talk about Liz? Don\u2019t you want to talk about that time you sabotaged her homework? Broke into her locker? Trashed her things?\u201d</p><p>I bite the inside of my cheek. \u201cMichael, stop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarted that rumor campaign about her? Hey, remember you told Duane Storey she was a total dyke when she was really into him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve been dying to know...was there actually a weekly \u2018Make Liz Cooper Cry\u2019 competition, or did it just turn out that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz was the reason I saw your mother,\u201d I snap. It catches Michael off guard. His eyes widen, just a little. \u201cYou don\u2019t have me pegged.\u201d I bite my lip. Hard. \u201cAnd I liked Liz. I didn\u2019t get off on watching Anna torture her every fucking day. She was my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend?\u201d he finishes in disbelief.</p><p>Once upon a time. Once upon a time, I really, really liked Liz. Total girl-crush. Being around her was so easy. And Liz liked me too. A lot. That was the problem.</p><p>She\u2019s pulling you away...</p><p>\u201cOkay, wait, so you fucked her up,\u201d Michael says slowly. \u201cAnd you went to my mom because you couldn\u2019t eat because you were fucked up because you fucked Liz up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that, yeah,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>Somehow this new piece of information only makes him hate me more. \u201cAlways the victim, right? Liz tried to kill herself, and I\u2019m supposed to sit here and feel sorry for you because you feel guilty about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tried to kill herself?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cOh, you didn\u2019t know?\u201d He nods. \u201cTook a bunch of pills over spring break at her grandparents\u2019. Her grandmother found her.\u201d I shake my head slowly. \u201cAnd she still came back to school. That\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t it? And that whole time you were ruining my life in the morning and seeing my mom in the afternoons....\u201d I press my hand against my mouth. \u201cWhat do they say, again? You reap what you sow.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know she tried to kill herself.</p><p>\u201cThen this should make you feel good,\u201d I say. \u201cDonnie Henderson? I totally didn\u2019t have sex with him, but not for lack of him trying really hard\u2014\u201d My voice breaks. \u201cI even have the bruises to prove it.\u201d</p><p>Silence. He gets it, and for a second he almost looks sorry, sick. \u201cRegina\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Liz,\u201d I say, \u201cthe mean girl totally got what she deserved in the end.\u201d</p><p>This was stupid, coming here. I turn away from him, make my way across the concrete to that small strip of grass that will lead me out. I\u2019m almost there when he calls my name, and then I stop and he says, \u201cNobody deserves that.\u201d</p><p>My house is quiet. Empty .</p><p>My parents work. They work and work and work. Except there\u2019s no work in Hallowell, so they go to the city, even though they\u2019re too old for the hours and commute, but that\u2019s okay with me because otherwise we might have to talk.</p><p>I sit at the kitchen table and press my face against its cold wooden surface. I stopped crying between my house and Michael\u2019s, but I could start again, so I just want to stay here and not move. I am not moving. Everything is fine, just so long as nobody moves me. But then the sun goes down and the room gets dark and I haul myself up from the table and shuffle to my room. I turn on the light and sit on the bed. Nobody deserves that. I imagine the words coming from Anna\u2019s mouth, Kara\u2019s, Josh\u2019s mouth, and then I do cry. One stupid tear after the other. My stomach doesn\u2019t feel so great, so I take an antacid and then I take another one. Nobody deserves that.</p><p>But I\u2019m starting to wonder.</p><p>To: Regina Afton</p><p>From: The YourSpaceTM Team</p><p>Subject: You have been invited to join the IH8RA group on YourSpaceTM!</p><p>Dear Regina,</p><p>You have been invited to join a fun new group on YourSpaceTM!

The computer hums in the next room, waiting for me, and I don\u2019t have what I need to have inside me to go back in there and click the link. Courage.</p><p>But that\u2019s not going to stop me from doing it anyway. Psychedelic-colored shapes float across the monitor\u2019s face. Screen saver. I jiggle the mouse, and the YourSpace page pops up. I stare at my choices: ACCEPT. REJECT. I choose neither. I click the blue link to take me to the group\u2019s page to see what it\u2019s about, because even though I know what it\u2019s about, some small part of me hopes I\u2019m wrong. The page loads.</p><p>I fall back into the chair. The soft sounds of the television in the living room drift in, and then other sounds follow: Dad rocking in his recliner. Mom washing dishes in the kitchen. I can hear the clinking of glass in the sink. A day off. A fan whirs next to me, raising warm air. It\u2019s all so quiet and so family and it\u2019s so perfect, and I have to share it with this\u2014a page as red as my locker.</p><p>In the upper right-hand corner of it is a picture of me. I minimize the screen, horrified, before pulling it up again. It\u2019s not a nice picture. It wouldn\u2019t be. I\u2019m staring at the camera through half lids, caught in midblink. I look stoned. My mouth is lax, and my hair is sticking out at all ends. I\u2019m not stoned. Anna woke me with the camera at a sleepover, and twenty-four hours later she had prints. It\u2019s hideous.</p><p>The entire world can look at it, and they can see me hideous.</p> <p>THIS IS A GROUP FOR PEOPLE WHO HATE REGINA AFTON. DO YOU HATE REGINA AFTON? FRIEND US AND LEAVE A COMMENT!!</p><p>I scroll down. The group has only one interest listed\u2014hating me. Anna heads up the featured friends, followed by Josh\u2014 And Kara and Marta and Jeanette and\u2014</p><p>IH8RA has 300 friends in total. There are only 450 students at Hallowell High. The remaining 150 either don\u2019t have a YourSpace account or they haven\u2019t checked their e-mail yet. I click through the page slowly, checking out avatars, recognizing faces. So many people. Some I\u2019ve spoken to, others I\u2019ve never spoken to. Some I loathe, others I\u2019ve never spared a second thought. A few I considered acquaintances. They\u2019re all here, all tied together by their apparent hatred of me.</p><p>I navigate back to the main page, to the comments.</p><p>YOU ARE VIEWING THE MOST RECENT OF 202 COMMENTS.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t read them. I have to read them.</p><p>i fuckin hate that bitch.</p><p>The first\u2014and latest\u2014comment belongs to Jake Martin, some sophomore I\u2019ve never really given a damn about. I thought he felt the same about me, but I guess not.</p><p>I guess he fuckin hates me.</p><p>Team Anna! :)</p><p>Kara, Jeanette, and Marta leave this comment several times, smiley face and all. Team Anna.</p><p>Thnx for the add.</p><p>My less-astute classmates leave this comment.

Each comment taking a cue from the last, each one a sharp jab at me. After a while, I even start feeling bruised. I scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page, and a link catches my eye:</p><p>REPORT ABUSE</p><p>My cursor hovers over it. Click it. Click it. Report abuse. Easy: Dear YourSpace, I\u2019d like to report abuse. My friends are abusing me.</p><p>REPORT ABUSE</p><p>I refresh the page, and the friend count has jumped. 302. So have the comments. 203. I refresh again and the comments jump again. 204. I straighten. People hate me and they\u2019re online right now, hating me. I want to know who they are and I want to know what they\u2019ll say. I have to know, so when I step into school tomorrow I\u2019ll have every comment tied to a face, so when I see those faces in the halls\u2013I\u2019ll know.</p><p>I refresh the page.</p><p>The buzz of my alarm clock jolts me awake. My mouth is parched and there\u2019s a crick in my neck. It takes me a minute to remember why I\u2019m not in bed. I fell asleep in front of the computer. The last time I looked at the YourSpace page, it was 6:00 a.m. Now it\u2019s a quarter after eight.</p><p>Forget coffee; I barely have time to get dressed, brush my teeth and hair. It isn\u2019t until I\u2019m racing across the parking lot that I realize how stupid this is: I\u2019m rushing to get to school. When I reach the front doors, I hit a wall. I can\u2019t step inside. I have one hand on the door handle, and it\u2019s like I\u2019m paralyzed. My mind tells my hand to open the door, but my hand won\u2019t do it. My insides are made up of millions of feral butterflies gnawing at every bit of peace inside of me until there\u2019s none. I can\u2019t open this door.</p><p>\u201cFucking move,\u201d someone mutters behind me. When I don\u2019t, they shove me out of the way. It\u2019s \u201cThnx for the Add.\u201d Nora Green. She glares at me, opens the door, and steps inside. I follow her in before it swings shut in my face.</p><p>I\u2019m ten steps in when \u201cSlut,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhore,\u201d and \u201cLoose\u201d walk by. Jeri Waters, Elliott Pike, Mary Schwartz. \u201cI fuckin hate that bitch\u201d is talking to Gary Doyle at Gary\u2019s locker. I start to shake. They both look me up and down when I pass.</p><p>Donnie is crossing the hall. I don\u2019t notice him until it\u2019s too late.</p><p>We slam into each other and stumble backward. He looks as bad as me, maybe worse. Unshaven, dirty, disgusting, wrecked. It\u2019s only been a week.</p><p>He glares at me and then he gets close, so close his mouth is inches from mine. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to do something like he did at Josh\u2019s party, and I wonder if anyone would do anything about it if he did, because they all hate me.</p><p>\u201cDie,\u201d he says, and then he walks away. I close my eyes, trying to keep it together, and when I open them, Michael is halfway down the hall, at the water fountain, watching me.</p><p>I head for my locker, where my lock refuses me. I try it over and over and over again and nothing happens. So I kick it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Michael. Behind me. I point at the lock. \u201cI can\u2019t get it open.\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cIt won\u2019t open.\u201d</p><p>I must look really pathetic, because he nudges me aside gently and grabs the lock. I can smell his aftershave. Sort of earthy and clean at the same time. I take a step back because I don\u2019t want to be this close to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your combination?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d Never tell anyone your locker combination. Ninth-grade orientation. It was the first thing they told us, but who follows the rules? \u201cTwelve, twenty, thirty-two, and two...\u201d</p><p>I watch his thumb spin the dial slowly, each number hitting its mark like I swear to God my thumb did. I rest my head against the locker.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should sit with me at lunch,\u201d he says after a minute. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s safer that way....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you about Donnie so you\u2019d feel sorry for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour call.\u201d He gives the lock a jerk. It breaks free. Miracle. \u201cThere you go.\u201d</p><p>When I raise my head to thank him, he\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cI told them to set up the net,\u201d Nelson mutters, surveying the gym .</p><p>\u201cWhere. Is. It?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know who \u201cthey\u201d are, but I\u2019d hate to be them when they run into Nelson later. Red creeps up her neck to her face: She\u2019s ready to blow. I overheard someone say her name and the word hangover in the same sentence earlier, and I think it might be true, because she hasn\u2019t touched her whistle.</p><p>\u201cMorrison!\u201d she barks. \u201cAfton! Go get the volleyball net out of the storage room, and the rest of you, get out there and jog until I tell you to stop!\u201d</p><p>No one moves. Everyone\u2019s holding their breath. It\u2019s so quiet I can hear the vein pulsing in Nelson\u2019s forehead. Morrison as in Anna. Afton as in me. The net in storage. Morrison! Afton! Go get the volleyball net out of storage. Together.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you people? Didn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d Nelson winces at the sound of her own voice. \u201cMove! Morrison, Afton, don\u2019t make me tell you twice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Nelson,\u201d Anna whines from her spot beside Kara and Josh, \u201ccan\u2019t Kara come with me instead?\u201d</p><p>I glance at Michael. He\u2019s across the gym standing near some guys, not quite a part of their group but definitely a part of the scene. He rolls his eyes, bored.</p><p>Muttering. The people around us are muttering. Nelson takes several deep breaths in and out, like Anna\u2019s just asked her the stupidest question in the world.</p><p>\u201cMorrison,\u201d she repeats, \u201cand Afton. Get. The. Net.\u201d</p><p>She jerks her thumb at the door. Anna\u2019s not dumb enough to tempt fate twice. Josh squeezes her shoulder sympathetically. Anna gives a horsey shake of her head, turns to Kara, mutters something bitchy, and walks across the room like she\u2019s on a catwalk, leaving me to chase after her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe rest of you, jog!\u201d Nelson shouts.</p><p>The jogging starts up\u2014a stampede. Noise explosion. As Anna and I exit the gym, Nelson orders everyone to do sit-ups instead.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me,\u201d Anna says, as we march down the hall. \u201cI\u2019m serious. Anything you want to say to me, I don\u2019t want to hear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>She makes an exasperated noise and keeps walking. I start stressing. And then the stress turns to laughter that tries to bubble up my throat and out of my mouth. It\u2019s not funny. If I laugh, I\u2019m dead. But I really want to laugh.</p><p>That must mean I\u2019m losing it.</p><p>My stomach reminds me this is no laughing matter. I find myself stopping in the middle of the hall, searching my pockets for an antacid. Anna doesn\u2019t realize I\u2019ve fallen behind until I\u2019m shoving one in my mouth and forcing it down, and then when she sees me, she rolls her eyes. I\u2019m white hot, like with Kara in the hall, except I don\u2019t want to hurt Anna, I just want her to see what a mistake she\u2019s</p><p>made. My hand autopilots back into my pocket for another antacid because I can feel my stomach boiling. \u201cPathetic,\u201d she says.</p><p>I don\u2019t blame whoever bailed on Nelson: The volleyball net is wedged at the back of the storage room, unraveled behind a row of gym mats against the wall. \u201cForget it,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cYou want to be the one to tell Nelson that?\u201d</p><p>I sigh and we start shifting mats. They\u2019re awkward as hell. The first ten minutes pass in the sounds of us breathing and the shuffle of the mats as we move them. When my arms start to ache and cramp, I notice she\u2019s stopped, letting me do the work for both of us, waiting for me to catch on.</p><p>\u201cWould you help?\u201d I ask. She just stares. I grab the edge of a mat and get back to work. \u201cFuck you, Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you ,\u201d she returns. \u201cI thought I could trust you, but I should\u2019ve known you\u2019d stab me in the back, especially after Liz. You were never the same after that. I should\u2019ve known you\u2019d fuck me over.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to hear Liz\u2019s name come out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cAnna, shut the fuck up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to shut the fuck up. He was my boyfriend. He was my boyfriend for two years, and no matter what you felt about him, whatever you think it was, he was still my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>I let go of the mat. \u201d I didn\u2019t sleep with him!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegina\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m going to keep saying it until she hears it. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep with Donnie, and Kara is totally setting you up. You look like a fool\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegina\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna, he tried to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>She pushes me. I hit the row of shelves behind us, and the metal edges dig into my skin, and then she\u2019s gone and I\u2019m alone. I sit on the floor and close my eyes, and when I open them again, it\u2019s not quite three-thirty, but close, so I leave.</p><p>The air-conditioning lasts the first five minutes of homeroom before dying a spectacular death, and now I\u2019m navigating my way to my next class through too many sweaty bodies, and I want to tell everyone to stop exhaling because they\u2019re just making it worse.</p><p>\u201cHey, Afton!\u201d I only stop for a second, until I realize it\u2019s Bruce, and then I keep moving. His voice follows me down the hall. \u201cIs it true you like it in the dark?\u201d</p><p>I ignore him. So does everyone else. His is one voice among many.</p><p>\u201cBecause Josh says you liked it in the dark.\u201d</p><p>I face him. He\u2019s annoyingly self-assured, smug. He makes his way over to me, talking the whole time, his voice carrying over the noise, forcing people to listen.</p><p>\u201cYou know. When you have sex. You like it in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>An uncomfortable heat works its way up to my face from my toes. Everyone seems to have paused to listen now, and the people walking in on the moment slow down, knowing instinctively that whatever comes out of Bruce\u2019s mouth next has to be heard; that it\u2019s going to be good. A redhead and a blonde are in my periphery. They\u2019re grinning.</p><p>\u201cBecause you hate the way you look. I mean, that\u2019s what he told me.\u201d Go to hell. I can\u2019t say it. My voice is gone. Bruce smiles. \u201cHow\u2019d he put it?...you \u2018wish you were a little more filled out.\u2019\u201d A few girls snicker behind me. \u201cHe wished that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t let him go down on you, right? What\u2019s up with that?\u201d</p><p>I force my way down the hall through the crowd that\u2019s gathered, but Bruce follows me. I try to tune him out. I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIs there something about you we should know? Should Josh get tested?\u201d</p><p>He keeps talking. Everyone\u2019s laughing. He stays on me. I dodge into the girls\u2019 room, but he grabs the door and holds it open. \u201cI\u2019m not done,\u201d he says.</p><p>I beg him with my eyes to stop. \u201cWhy are you doing this to me, Bruce? I have never done anything to you.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything. He just stands there grinning. It\u2019s not like I need an answer. He\u2019s working for Anna. He\u2019s crushed on her for ages.</p><p>\u201cJosh didn\u2019t tell me shit,\u201d he says. \u201cAnna gave me all my lines. Is it true? Do you really like it in the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think doing Anna\u2019s dirty work is going to get you a free pass into her pants, you\u2019re mistaken,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure she thinks you\u2019re too small.\u201d</p><p>His face turns red and he raises his voice. \u201cJosh called you a good lay, but not a great one\u2014\u201d</p><p>I yank the door shut, but he keeps shouting through it. I lock myself in one of the stalls and bite my fist until I gag, and every muscle in my body is tight and my joints are all seized up. I breathe around my fist, sucking in air through the narrow space until Bruce finally stops and goes, and then I thaw. Slowly. The bell rings. I study the teeth marks in my skin, slimy with sweat. Phys ed. I have to show my face in front of a gym full of people who think I like it in the dark. Is it true? Should Josh get tested?</p><p>When I step out of the stall, Liz is in front of the mirror brushing her hair. My heart flip-flops. Liz isn\u2019t surprised to see me. She\u2019s never surprised to see me. She runs the brush through her hair, takes an elastic from around her wrist, and pulls her hair into a ponytail. I feel hollow, just like I felt in the days after it became devastatingly clear to her we weren\u2019t going to be friends again and I was going to have to make her life miserable. Enough for her......to want to die.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sor-ry,\u201d I say, and my voice cracks, splitting the word sorry in two.</p><p>She lowers her hand and turns to me slowly, setting the brush on the counter. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>I try to find the word again\u2014 sorry \u2014but it\u2019s gone. I want to tell her she\u2019s brave, she\u2019s stupid brave for coming into school day after day knowing what is waiting for her, and I want to tell her she was the best thing in my life for one brief moment in time, and I want to tell her that I\u2019m sorry I stood by while she was ruined, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I am so sorry.</p><p>She turns back to the mirror, silent.</p><p>When Nelson orders us to stand in a line against the wall, I know what\u2019s coming next.</p><p>She\u2019ll select two captains and they\u2019ll pick teams.</p><p>Since we have an uneven class, the last one left keeps score, because the last one left always keeps score, because alternating is a pain in the ass. I\u2019ve spent the first half of my life being one of the lucky ones; I\u2019ve always had a team. Now my lack of a team, the lack of people wanting me on their team, is going to satisfy two sets of people\u2014my ex-friends and everyone I\u2019ve gotten picked over in the past. Picking teams.</p><p>How do teachers forget how horrible this is.</p><p>We line up. My hand goes for my pocket, but I stop short of getting an antacid. I don\u2019t want to give anyone the satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cBasketball,\u201d Nelson says, blowing her whistle. \u201cMyers and Carey, pick your teammates, and be quick about it.\u201d</p><p>Kara and Josh amble up to the front. It says something about Nelson that she never gives losers the opportunity to captain. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever picked Kara to captain before, and I wonder if teachers always acquiesce to these shifts in popularity, like everyone seems to, whether they really want to or not.</p><p>Josh and Kara do a sweep of the room. Their eyes linger on each of us, sizing us up for a basketball game no One will give a damn about after everyone\u2019s picked. When Josh gets to me, I feel like a piece of meat.</p><p>He nods at Bruce. \u201cBurton.\u201d</p><p>Kara grins and points at Anna. The whole ordeal lasts only ten minutes, the deliberations taking longer and longer the less people there are to choose from, until there are only two of us left. Me and Donnie. We stand beside each other, tense.</p><p>Last call belongs to Josh.</p><p>\u201cNot Regina,\u201d Anna says really loudly. I try to pretend I don\u2019t care, but I do.</p><p>It\u2019s completely humiliating.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Josh says, nodding at Donnie. Donnie sags with relief and makes his way to Josh\u2019s side, weaving slightly. I glance at Nelson. She notices\u2014I can tell by the look on her face\u2014but she doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>I hate this school.</p><p>As soon as Donnie is hovering on the outside of Josh\u2019s team, this is what the whole scene looks like:</p><p>TEAM 1 TEAM 2 ME</p><p>Nelson blows her whistle.</p><p>\u201cBench, Afton,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s your lucky day.\u201d</p><p>Someone dog-whistles and barks at me, and everyone snickers. I make my way over to the bench. The game starts. I lean my head against the wall and stare at the ceiling. One of the fluorescent lights overhead flickers, and somebody scores and somebody else scores, but no one ever asks me for the tally. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shift my focus to Anna. Her auburn hair dances around her face, and her skin is shiny with sweat. And then I watch Kara and my fingers get that familiar itch. Instead of curbing this uncomfortable feeling with pills, I decide to stew, to let their betrayal build until I can hear the blood rushing around my head. It sounds like a dam after spring thaw. The ball goes off-court and rolls my way, and I watch Kara chase after it, laughing, and I\u2019m angry and I need to do something about it. Do something.</p><p>It\u2019s a small voice inside of my head. Do something. The ball gets closer. Do something. She gets closer. Do something. I stick my foot out. Don\u2019t do that.</p><p>But it\u2019s too late to take it back. Kara\u2019s foot slams into my ankle\u2014it hurts\u2014and she shrieks. Everyone stops what they\u2019re doing to watch her fly. It\u2019s one of those running falls that seems to last forever, too. She stumbles onto the floor, and the sound she makes when she finally hits it face-first goes straight to my bones in a really good way, and in the heavy pause before she starts wailing and everyone else starts buzzing...</p> <p>I laugh.</p><p>I clamp my hand over my mouth, and her audience becomes mine. They\u2019re torn about which one to look at\u2014her or me? Another giggle escapes through the crack in my fingers. I clamp my other hand over my mouth.</p><p>Stop. This is bad.</p><p>When Kara gets to her feet, furious and red-faced, she\u2019s a mirror image of me. Both of her hands are pressed against her mouth, and there are tears in her eyes.</p><p>Don\u2019t laugh.</p> <p>The room stays quiet. Nelson jogs over to Kara, but Anna manages to get to her first. She tries to draw Kara\u2019s hands away from her mouth, and I remember Donnie, Donnie with his hands over his bloody nose and it\u2019s great, and then the tears come, tears are streaming down Kara\u2019s face and she\u2019s hurt. Kara is hurt. I hurt her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Myers?\u201d Nelson barks. Kara jerks away, shaking her head. A sob escapes her lips, and she walks away from both of them. \u201cMyers, get back here!\u201d</p><p>Kara keeps her back to all of us, crying. Anna ventures over, murmurs something at her, and Kara sobs something back and moves her hands from her mouth, and I remember Donnie and the stairs flying past me and the YourSpace page and the books, and however hurt Kara is, it\u2019s not enough. I want her to hurt until there\u2019s nothing there for Anna to comfort. I dig my fingernails into my palm and breathe.</p><p>I got to hurt her some.</p><p>That\u2019s something.</p><p>I just wish she\u2019d turn around and show us all how much. And then she does.</p> <p>\u201cYou did that on purpose!\u201d It\u2019s not obvious\u2014whatever damage I caused. I search her face and can\u2019t find it. \u201cYou tripped me! I saw you stick your foot out\u2014 owww\u2014\u201d</p><p>She covers her mouth again and cries. Nelson blows her whistle in an attempt to reclaim control of the situation and forces Kara to remove her hand.</p><p>\u201cMouth?\u201d Nelson asks. Kara nods. Nelson tilts Kara\u2019s head back and inspects her mouth. I step forward for a better look. So does everyone else.</p><p>\u201cChipped tooth,\u201d Nelson mutters, and I finally see it.</p><p>Chipped is an understatement. Half of Kara\u2019s right front tooth is missing, and I wince in spite of myself, because I know how much they hurt. But I stop feeling sorry for her as soon as the picture really registers, because she\u2019s missing half her front tooth. That\u2019s hilarious. Don\u2019t laugh. Don\u2019t laugh. Don\u2019t laugh.</p><p>Laugh later.</p><p>\u201cGet to the office, call your parents, see if you can get to a dentist today,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cYou\u2019ll need it, Myers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Nelson,\u201d Anna breaks in, \u201cRegina tripped Kara. She was laughing\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Kara nods frantically. \u201cShe did it on purpose\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her tooth interrupts her. She closes her eyes, clamps her mouth shut, and rides it out. I watch the impression of her tongue bubble up under her lip as she runs it over the place her tooth isn\u2019t anymore. Nelson turns to me, face hard. Her face is always hard.</p><p>\u201cIs this true, Afton?\u201d</p><p>Everyone stares at me.</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident,\u201d I say innocently. \u201cShe got in the way.\u201d</p><p>Josh\u2019s head whips up. Anna\u2019s mouth drops open. Kara looks ready to explode. Nelson orders her to the nurse\u2019s office and shouts us back to the game. There\u2019s room for me to be on the team, but no one wants me, so I go back to keeping score.</p><p>Today, it\u2019s Regina: 1, Kara: 0.</p><p>\u201cDonnie\u2019s off the basketball team,\u201d Michael tells me at lunch .</p><p>He said it was my call, so I made it. I decided to sit with him instead of hiding in the girls\u2019 room because I didn\u2019t want to run into Liz again. I was nervous crossing the room and making my way over, but he didn\u2019t look unhappy to see me, I guess.</p><p>\u201cBasketball was the only thing he loved doing sober,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI overheard it in the changing rooms,\u201d Michael says. \u201cThey forced him off by threatening to tell his parents he was cheating on the drug tests. I thought of you when I heard it. I thought you\u2019d want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I want it to feel good, but it doesn\u2019t, because it\u2019s smaller than what Donnie did to me. So he can\u2019t play basketball. So what.</p><p>The center table is completely empty. It\u2019s like they all took the day off to go with Kara to her emergency dental appointment or something. Everyone\u2019s talking about Kara\u2019s tooth, and no one is talking about how I like it in the dark. It\u2019s so perfect I wish I\u2019d planned it.</p><p>\u201cThey made this YourSpace hate group about me,\u201d I say.</p><p>It gets quiet\u2014as quiet as it can get in the cafeteria\u2014and it\u2019s unnerving. I don\u2019t know Michael well enough to understand his quiet. When Anna\u2019s quiet, she\u2019s mad or bored. Kara gets quiet when she\u2019s thinking of ways to bring everyone\u2019s attention back to her. When Jeanette gets quiet, she\u2019s spacing, and when Marta\u2019s quiet, she\u2019s sad.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he finally says. \u201cI got an invite in my e-mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you join?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s stupid. They could\u2019ve been more original.\u201d</p><p>Probably.</p><p>But it still stings.</p><p>Michael grabs his tray and stands. I stand.</p><p>\u201cThanks...\u201d I say awkwardly, gesturing to the table, \u201c...for this.\u2019</p><p>He nods curtly and leaves without me.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting at my desk in my bedroom, where there\u2019s a photo of the five of us.</p><p>The Fearsome Fivesome.</p><p>Me and Anna are laughing about something, and Kara stares at us, smiling, longing to be in on it. She\u2019s there, but she never matters. Marta and Jeanette are in their own little world, forever okay with it because they have each other. I set the photo face down. Behind it is a little box. What I\u2019m looking for.</p><p>I reach for it and fumble with the lid and find the notes.</p><p>Every year of high school is chronicled in scrap pieces of paper in this box. Our secrets. I save the ones Anna didn\u2019t get her hands on, because I knew what she wanted to keep them for\u2014insurance, and then, if needed, ammunition. I dump the papers on my desk and run my fingers over them, all folded to perfection. I pick one, unfold it, and squint at the tiny handwriting in the margins of some old math homework.</p><p>Are you mad at me? My handwriting.</p><p>Would you quit asking me that? Anna.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>I crumple the paper and toss it aside, rifle through the pile and pick another.</p><p>Another exchange between Anna and me. Liz is out.</p><p>Are you serious?</p><p>I\u2019m serious. She\u2019s out.</p><p>Rethink this. Please.</p><p>Liz is out.</p><p>Wait. I trace the letters with my index fingers and close my eyes. I\u2019m sitting at my desk, writing. Please. Please with all of my heart. I slide the note over to Anna. She unfolds it, scribbles down those three words again and slides it back to me. And that was it. I rifle through the notes until someone else\u2019s handwriting catches my eye. It\u2019s so girly, it\u2019s Kara\u2019s, of course. I smooth out the paper and read. An old one:</p><p>I\u2019m at my goal weight. Now I\u2019m readjusting the goal!</p><p>That\u2019s all it says. No reply, nothing. It might not have even been for me. Maybe I just collected it. I separate all the papers that have glimpses of Kara\u2019s handwriting on them and push the rest aside. I examine the notes, one after the other.</p><p>Can I hang out with you and Anna tonight?</p><p>NO.</p><p>I don\u2019t even soften the blow. It\u2019s just there, hard lines etched into the graph paper\u2014NO\u2014underlined for effect, in case she didn\u2019t get the message, because Kara never got the message. On the other side of the page, her writing again. One question, no response:</p><p>Please?</p><p>I close my eyes briefly and reach for another note. I started this one:</p><p>Quit sulking. Me.</p><p>I\u2019m not. Kara.</p><p>Yes, you are. You have been since lunch. So Bruce called you fat\u2014so what?</p><p>From the earlier days.</p><p>It was humiliating.</p><p>You\u2019ve been fatter.</p><p>I look awful.</p><p>So do something about it.</p><p>Like what? Have you talked to Josh for me yet?</p><p>I remember that next line:</p><p>You can buy diet pills over the counter, you know. You don\u2019t even need Josh.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Yes. I\u2019ll go to Ford\u2019s and show you. I\u2019ll even buy them for you if it stops you from fucking whining.</p><p>I stood next to her at Ford\u2019s while she bought the over-the-counter diet pills. And then, from that point on, I watched her melt. It made Anna happy.</p><p>Another:</p><p>Are you mad at me?</p><p>I can\u2019t talk now.</p><p>Just tell me if you\u2019re mad at me.</p><p>Yeah, kind of. But I wasn\u2019t. I can see it in my handwriting. I wasn\u2019t. I was just saying it because I liked gutting her. I got harder on Kara after the Liz thing. I was so angry, and she was there.

I don\u2019t care about being Anna\u2019s friend. Really, I don\u2019t. But I\u2019d like to stay yours. I know she doesn\u2019t want you to talk to me, but hear me out: Can you talk to her for me? I can\u2019t figure out what I did. So if you could find out and let me know how to fix it, that\u2019d be great. If you could put in a good word for me, that\u2019d be even better. I really want to sort this out before it gets really bad, and I really want to stay friends with you. Let me know.</p><p>Liz</p> <p>I have this memory of Liz. We froze her out, sabotaged her, finished up the rumor campaign, and she had no reputation and no friends, and Anna was bored with it, uninspired, but she wasn\u2019t done, because she wanted to make sure I got the message.</p><p>So this one day, Anna got Bruce to play keep-away with Liz\u2019s books. Everyone stopped to watch. It wasn\u2019t a big deal. Nelson intervened really quickly, and the crowd dissipated, but Liz just stood there and looked so lost, like she didn\u2019t want to be there anymore. I imagine her sitting on her bed, in her bedroom with a bottle of pills.</p><p>I look at the note too long, running my fingers over the old stale dried ink.</p><p>Josh and Anna flit by my locker. Laughing and talking .</p><p>It\u2019s weird hearing their voices, animated, playing off each other\u2014a scarily vibrant conversation. At first I think I\u2019m dreaming, but I turn in time to see them walking down the hall side by side. Anna tosses her hair over her shoulder. She\u2019s flirting with him and he\u2019s flirting back. How could he resist a Siren? How could anyone? Anna doesn\u2019t like being single for lengthy periods at a time. She likes being taken and unattainable. Josh was probably in her sights as soon as he dumped me.</p> <p>They\u2019re totally perfect for each other.</p><p>But in math class, I start thinking about it, and it\u2019s not okay. In ten days, I have not held his hand in the hall. He hasn\u2019t waited for me at my locker between classes. He hasn\u2019t given me a kiss on the cheek when the bell separates us. I carve myself out of all these memories and put Anna in my place, and my chest aches, not because I\u2019m romantic or sentimental\u2014I hate Josh\u2014but because these were things that belonged to me and now they don\u2019t belong to me anymore.</p><p>When the bell rings, I\u2019m cemented to my seat by this thought. The room empties, and Brenner looks up from his papers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a class to be in, Afton?\u201d</p><p>I do, but I skip it for the library. I can\u2019t wait until my parents see my report card for this term, but I wouldn\u2019t trade that moment for this one, in the library, where it\u2019s nice and quiet. I move in and out of shelves, trying to act normal, like this isn\u2019t, me hiding, but it\u2019s always, always me hiding. I really want to sort this out before it gets really bad, and I really want to stay friends with you. This is the only reason I miss Anna: She used to tell me it was okay, no matter what. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a class to be in?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not Brenner\u2019s voice. That\u2019s not any teacher. I turn. Michael\u2019s at the computer terminal. I hesitate before edging over. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d think he looked happy to see me.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cFree period,\u201d he says. He gestures to the computer beside him, and I sit down. He\u2019s got a game of solitaire drawn up. I don\u2019t know what to do. I watch him shift red cards onto black and black cards onto red before I turn to my monitor, sign in with my user name, and connect to the Internet. I type the IH8RA URL into the address bar and watch the page load slowly on the school\u2019s crappy connection. The red background comes up first, and next, that horrible picture of me. The members and comment count have both jumped, and I think I\u2019m sitting next to the only person in this school who hasn\u2019t joined up.</p><p>\u201cReport abuse,\u201d Michael says, startling me.</p><p>I shake my head. He puts his hand over mine and guides my mouse to the Report Abuse link. The cursor hovers over the bold lettering, but I can\u2019t bring myself to click it. His index finger presses down on mine slightly, and the weight of his hand against my hand is so strange. He\u2019s waiting for me to give him the go-ahead.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I breathe, and his hand comes off mine. He stares at me like I\u2019m an idiot. \u201cAnna would love it if I reported it. If I do, they\u2019ll just bring out something worse.\u201d</p><p>He nods at the screen. \u201cNice picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, tell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you stoned?\u201d</p> <p>I close the browser. \u201cI was half asleep.\u201d</p><p>He studies me and then turns back to his game. After a few minutes, he\u2019s in total solitaire mode. It\u2019s just him and these pixelated cards on-screen and nothing else. This must be how he spends all of his free periods. He must sit in front of the computer and play games that only require one player. His face is intent. It\u2019s like I\u2019m not here.</p><p>I turn back to the computer and then, impulsively, Google his name. The seventh result is an obituary. I click it.</p><p>HAYDEN, NATALIE JUNE</p><p>Suddenly on September 30th. Natalie Hayden (nee Adams) of Hallowell, Connecticut, in her 41st year...</p><p>It\u2019s like looking at porn. I rub the back of my neck and try not to look like I\u2019m looking at porn and read through it, learning more about Michael in a few paragraphs than he\u2019d ever tell me himself. His maternal grandparents are dead, which is something we have in common. He has no aunts or uncles. It\u2019s just him and his dad. I wonder what his dad is like. When I glean all the information I can, I x out of the page and Google the accident. The overpass collapse. It\u2019s morbidly fascinating to find the earliest reports of it\u2014the ones with guesstimated body counts\u2014and click forward from guesses to actual numbers to actual names. Entire families under concrete.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to think of Dr. Hayden that way. I can feel Michael next to me, really next to me, and I know I should stop before he sees me, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at that?\u201d Michael asks. His voice is flat. I make the browser disappear, but it\u2019s too late.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was just\u2014\u201d And then I say something really stupid: \u201cMy grandparents are dead too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what happens when we Google you,\u201d he says. He shuts down the game of solitaire, pulls up Google, and types in my name. The first result is some woman on a high-school-reunion site. The second is the YourSpace page. He smiles. \u201cFunny how the last thing we want the world to see is almost the first thing to show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least your future employers aren\u2019t going to think you\u2019re a slut.\u201d</p><p>I log off the computer for lack of anything better to do, and Michael does the same, and then we just sit there, staring at the blank screens.</p><p>\u201cDo you usually do this with your free period? Come in here and play solitaire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly,\u201d Michael says. \u201cLately, I\u2019ve been writing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I haven\u2019t seen you scribbling in the cafeteria lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there was this hostile alien takeover at my lunch table....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can even bring your journal into this school. If I did, it\u2019d be gone in a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody\u2019s interested in my secrets,\u201d he reminds me. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlueprints for murder.\u201d I smile. \u201cThe next great school shooting. That\u2019s what people think of you.\u201d Pause. \u201cBecause of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of you,\u201d he agrees.</p><p>He looks at me. The moment closes in, and I feel so bad about it that I laugh. It\u2019s not funny, but the tension is killing me. I stop laughing, and my whole chest is pins and needles, and I really feel like I\u2019m going to cry or throw up, so I get up and I just leave him there, when what I really want to do is tell him I\u2019m sorry and that I mean it, except it wouldn\u2019t mean anything to him. I don\u2019t know how it could.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s into me,\u201d Anna says, and then she raises her voice so</p><p>I can hear. \u201cJosh.\u201d</p><p>I take the bait. I look up. Postgym. Changing in the changing rooms. I\u2019m sitting on a bench wedged in the corner, glimpsing Anna\u2019s pink push-up bra as she changes into a soft, blush-pink sweater. They\u2019re all in pink today.</p><p>Jeanette catches me staring and nudges Marta.</p><p>\u201cDyke,\u201d Jeanette spits in my direction. Anna yanks her shirt down quickly, like I\u2019m sitting here and I really give a damn about her breasts. I zip up my jeans.</p><p>\u201cI need to get him like, alone-alone, because we only ever talk at school, right? It doesn\u2019t matter what you say in a building full of people; what you say when you\u2019re alone, that matters.\u201d She straightens her sweater. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to look desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re chasing after my castoffs,\u201d I say. I shouldn\u2019t, but I can\u2019t resist. \u201cI think it\u2019s already too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hear something?\u201d Anna asks loudly. \u201cHey guys, listen to this: Did you know Donnie totally tried to rape Regina?\u201d</p><p>They laugh. I grip the edges of the bench, riding out a wave of anger that gives me such a head rush, the room momentarily tilts. They\u2019re laughing.</p><p>They think it\u2019s funny.</p><p>Kara studies her reflection in the mirror hanging on the wall, a pink sweater clutched in one hand. Spidery, silvery lines snake up the sides of her flat, undefined stomach. Stretch marks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do a group thing,\u201d she murmurs, and her voice sounds tinny, far away. I am glued to the bench in this rage, torn between getting up and leaving or attacking her. I can\u2019t figure out how to move and be this angry. \u201cThis weekend, we\u2019ll do some group thing and then, at some point, we\u2019ll disappear. You\u2019ll have him alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKara, you\u2019re a fucking genius,\u201d Anna says. \u201cBut I can\u2019t wait that long.\u201d She pauses. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll drive to his place tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s something quietly amazing about this moment, where I\u2019m looking at Kara and she\u2019s acting like she\u2019s me. The bell rings. People filter out. Jeanette and Marta beeline for the door, but Anna holds back, waiting for Kara, who is putting on her shirt.</p><p>She turns to Anna. \u201cDo I look okay? I look okay, right?\u201d</p><p>Before, Anna would\u2019ve rolled her eyes. I refuse to feed into your insecurities, Kara. Own it or fuck off. Now she says, \u201cYou look great.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a second,\u201d Kara tells her. Anna leaves.</p><p>She leaves the two of us alone together.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out, Regina,\u201d Kara says, like the room belongs to her.</p><p>She starts fussing with her hair. She\u2019s been obsessive about her hair since the photos from sophomore year\u2014the wig. I remember pulling her aside in the hall after they were taken. Anna told me to tell her. Kara, do something about your...hair.</p><p>She\u2019s thinking the same thing. She frowns, letting the strands of blond hair slip between her fingers. She turns to me.</p> <p>\u201cYou made me hate myself.\u201d She says it in a voice like it\u2019s this epiphany she has over and over. \u201cYou know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sitting here and listening to how wronged you feel,\u201d I</p><p>\u201cI just want you to understand what I\u2019ve done to you this year is barely what you deserve. I\u2019m going to make you so sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you started out too big,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cYou went too far, too soon. I can\u2019t believe you spent all that time with me and Anna and you never learned anything. I might have felt bad, but you pushed it, and now I\u2019ll never be sorry.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll have to try harder.\u201d</p><p>She leaves.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know why, but I start thinking about Liz. And then I think about Donnie. I bring my knees up, curling into myself as much as I can on the narrow bench. I press my forehead against my jeans, and then I start to cry. I don\u2019t want to cry. Soon there\u2019s a nice wet spot on my left knee because I can\u2019t stop.</p><p>The lunch bell rings. Some girls will trickle in here to change, so they can spend the time they\u2019re meant to be eating working out in the gym. I check myself in the mirror. I look like I\u2019ve been crying.</p><p>I brave-face the cafeteria, entering the bustling room and wandering through a maze of bodies, straight to the Garbage Table. Michael\u2019s already there, a tray of food beside him. He\u2019s scribbling in his Moleskine, and his face inspires another apology I\u2019ll never have the guts to give him. He stops writing when he sees me. He closes the book, sets it aside, pulls the tray of food toward him, and starts eating.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think you were coming,\u201d he says. I dig into my pocket for an antacid. \u201cHave you been crying?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s obvious. I don\u2019t know why he has to ask. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cjust thought I\u2019d ask on the off chance that you have been.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the table and my eyes well up. This is totally fantastic. I wipe at my eyes, which only seems to cause more tears, and when I chance a look at Michael I can tell he\u2019s trying not to look like this is a big deal or that it\u2019s weird.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you never asked me what I did to Kara to make her hate me,\u201d I say. He stays silent and waits for me to tell him. I lean forward and press my hand against my eyes and I start laughing\u2013 I don\u2019t know why\u2014 and crying, and I feel like a freak and I can\u2019t stop. I lean back in my chair, taking big gulps of stale cafeteria air.</p> <p>Michael stares at me like I\u2019ve lost my mind.</p><p>\u201cMy mom must\u2019ve had a field day with you,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cThe second time I was in your mom\u2019s office, she asked me if I wanted a Lifesaver, and I thought she was talking about herself, you know, but it was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe candy,\u201d Michael finishes. \u201cShe did that sometimes, but only to people who she thought had a sense of humor. She must\u2019ve thought that about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like her,\u201d I tell him. \u201cShe was so nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw her, I really didn\u2019t want her to know I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stop. I don\u2019t want to finish that sentence, and Michael is leaning so far over the table it makes me uncomfortable. There\u2019s a heartbreaking eagerness about the way he\u2019s listening to me. It scares me. I need something to do with my hands. A distraction. I reach for his Moleskine and run my hands along the edges. It\u2019s half swollen, half scribbled in. I flip it open to the first page and glimpse his handwriting\u2014 If found, return to Michael Hayden. 555-3409, 11 Hutt Avenue, Hallowell, Connecticut \u2014before he rips it from my hands.</p><p>\u201cIf I ever want you to know what\u2019s on those pages, I\u2019ll show them to you,\u201d he says, and he\u2019s flushed, like he\u2019s angry at himself for letting me hold it for even a second. \u201cThey\u2019re private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll never see them, then,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Time is going by so slow today. I watch the minute hand on the clock snail forward.</p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t want her to know you were what?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>I pull my gaze away from the clock to look at him, and he\u2019s staring at the table. He really wants to know, but I can\u2019t tell him, and as soon as that becomes apparent, he shakes his head and returns to his lunch, disappointed.</p><p>I pick at my fingernails and pretend not to notice.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to wake up. Even the promise of the weekend can\u2019t inspire me to get out of bed so I can get the day over with. The sky is overcast, gray. The weatherman says rain, but I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.</p><p>I swallow down my antacid and coffee at the breakfast table while my parents get ready to leave for work. Dad\u2019s the first out the door, but Mom hangs back.</p><p>\u201cThe school called,\u201d she says, rummaging through her purse. \u201cI know it\u2019s senior year and you\u2019ve got a lot of energy to burn, but if you keep cutting your classes, Regina, you\u2019re going to start losing privileges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of privileges?\u201d I ask, staring down my coffee mug.</p><p>\u201cNo more talking to Anna or any of your friends on the phone after school, no Josh on the weekends, no parties, you\u2019ll have a curfew, the works.\u201d</p><p>This is so depressing, I want to laugh. Instead, I chew on my lower lip and try to act, like, you know, wow. Never seeing my friends again. Ouch. I think I\u2019ll just stop cutting class, like, immediately.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cGet it together,\u201d she tells me. \u201cAnd have a good day. I love you.\u201d</p><p>She leaves. I wait until I hear her car pull out of the driveway and then I ease my way from the table to the sink. I fill my mug and watch as the bit of coffee I left in it turns the water murky before it goes clear. Thunder rumbles in the distance, and I stop dragging my feet. I get my stuff and step outside. It\u2019s hot, but the breeze is cool. It\u2019s going to storm.</p><p>I\u2019ve barely thought it when the sky opens up. I do that stupid caught-in-the-rain running jog for all of five seconds before giving up. I\u2019m soaked.</p><p>I spot Michael\u2019s Saturn in the parking lot when I finally reach Hallowell High. He\u2019s in the front seat, waiting for a break in the rain, but I know that\u2019s not happening. I make my way over to the car. He rolls down the window.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drenched,\u201d he says.</p><p>I pull his door open. \u201cYou will be too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for it to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive a little.\u201d</p><p>I almost reach for his arm to pull him out of the car but think better of it. He rolls the window up, steps out, and is instantly wet. His hair is plastered to his forehead and his shirt hugs his torso, leaving an impression of the muscle underneath. A clap of thunder makes us both jump. I stare at the school. Spending the day there makes less and less sense, the more I think about it.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go in like this,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not getting into my car like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I make my exit. I don\u2019t really care if he follows me or not. Lightning flashes, momentarily breaking up the gloomy gray and sending the rain down even harder. I\u2019m halfway across the road when I hear Michael\u2019s sneakers slapping against the wet pavement as he makes his way over to me.</p><p>It\u2019s still raining when we push through the door to Val\u2019s Diner. The place smells good. Frying-bacon-and-eggs-and-toast-with-butter good, and it\u2019s been so long since I had an actual breakfast, my mouth immediately starts watering and my stomach growls. Today, I could eat.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve lived here and you\u2019ve never been here,\u201d I say, guiding Michael past rows of uncomfortable plastic booths. \u201cI come here, I mean, came here once a month with\u2014\u201d That jerk I used to date. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheckered floors.\u201d He sounds amused.</p><p>I slide into a plastic booth near the back. Michael sits across from me. Our clothes squelch against the plastic, and water drips off my clothes, making little puddles at my feet, on my seat. The place is full of rain refugees but no one from school, which is good, because otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be able to eat no matter how tempting the smell.</p><p>We settle in and the waitress appears. Her nametag says angie.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t the two of you be in school?\u201d she asks, like we\u2019re the first teenagers who have ever come here when we should be there.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, and then I launch into my order. \u201cI\u2019ll have an egg, sunny-side up, with a side of bacon and toast and home fries and orange juice with the pulp, please.\u201d</p><p>Angie turns to Michael, frowning. He flashes a smile at her and he has a nice smile, but it leaves her totally unmoved. \u201cI\u2019ll have the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two should be in school,\u201d she says, and then she goes.</p><p>\u201cFood\u2019s good, but the waitstaff is self-righteous,\u201d I say when she\u2019s out of earshot. He laughs, which makes me smile. I pick at the jam packets in the glass bowl beside us. I select one of each flavor and line them up between us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hate apricot,\u201d I say, pushing the pale orange packet his way.</p><p>\u201cNot a fan of blueberry,\u201d he returns, pushing that packet my way. I alternate pushing the other three my way and his, creating an elaborate jam-packet design on the table. I can\u2019t wait until the food gets here.</p><p>\u201cThis is uncomfortable,\u201d Michael says.</p> <p>I gather up all the jam packets and put them back. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not that,\u201d he says quickly. He shifts and there\u2019s this ridiculous squeak of wet clothes against the plastic. \u201cWet jeans don\u2019t feel that great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll dry out soon.\u201d</p><p>Michael stares out the window. It\u2019s still pouring.</p><p>\u201cAnd then we\u2019ll get soaked all over again,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d I watch some poor woman get totally doused as she crosses the crosswalk. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to break the heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll eat to that.\u201d</p><p>We wait for Angie to bring us our food. After ten minutes or so, it comes. I zone out; I shove huge forkfuls into my mouth. Everything tastes amazing. Breakfast\u2013what a concept. I\u2019m halfway through my plate when I notice Michael staring. He\u2019s barely made a dent in his meal, and I feel stupid.</p><p>\u201cI just realized I\u2019ve never seen you eat before,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t eat at school,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s too stress\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stop. Awkward.</p> <p>\u201cActually, this is the first time I\u2019ve had breakfast in a while, too.\u201d</p><p>Michael looks at his plate. \u201cDad isn\u2019t much of a cook. Neither am I. Neither was my mom for the most part, but she made awesome eggs-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSo what do you eat? It\u2019s the most important meal of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranola bars, cereal,\u201d he says, and then he laughs. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThis is a very involved conversation about food.\u201d He leans back in his seat. \u201cYeah...my mom liked the idea of food better than actually making it. We were fast-foodies. It was her dirty little secret.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cSo she didn\u2019t like to cook. She wasn\u2019t making a career out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe liked to listen,\u201d Michael says. \u201cShe made a career out of that. And it was a brilliant one. She was really good at what she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she was.\u201d I miss her. Just like that. I feel it. I miss her.</p> <p>\u201cSo\u2014when did you hear? I mean, when did you hear about ...it happening?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I can\u2019t remember exactly how I heard. My parents. It was one of my parents. It wasn\u2019t that long after. I take a sip of juice, buying time, hoping he can\u2019t see it on my face. The diner\u2019s phone rings, sparking a memory.</p><p>\u201cThe office called the week it happened,\u201d I say. \u201cWe sent a card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got lots of cards,\u201d Michael says, nodding. \u201cShe had this one patient, he had OCD, like, bad. He freaked when she died. He left all these messages at the office....\u201d</p><p>He trails off and it gets quiet. A month ago I would have never pictured myself here in Val\u2019s Diner with Michael. With no friends. And not feeling like it\u2019s not that bad a thing\u2014to be here with him. With no friends.</p><p>\u201cI was at school,\u201d he says suddenly. He runs the tines of his fork through the leftover egg yolk on the plate, drawing designs in all that sunny yellow. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you knew that. I got sent down to Holt\u2019s office, and Dad was there. He was crying and I just didn\u2019t get it. If you knew my dad, he\u2019s really stoic, right? But he was crying and he told me, and I thought it was a joke until I saw it on the news. I didn\u2019t think of her as...crushed until I saw the wreckage on TV. It was bad because I\u2014\u201d he shrugs and sets his fork down. \u201cI thought I\u2019d get to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His voice cracks. He presses his lips together tightly, and my gaze travels down to his hands. He\u2019s clutching the edges of the table so hard his knuckles are white. I want more than anything to reach over and touch his hand, some small gesture that means it\u2019s going to be okay, because that\u2019s what I would want, if I was him. I\u2019ve almost gathered the courage to do it when he takes a sharp breath in that startles me and keeps my hands at my side.</p><p>\u201cMichael, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine how horrible that would be.</p><p>He swallows once, twice, three times, trying to keep it together. I want to ask him why he even brought it up if he can\u2019t talk about it yet. And then his eyes get bright: He\u2019s close to crying. I want to give him some privacy, but I can\u2019t look away. I watch him clench his jaw, just fighting with himself to keep from letting the tears spill out. His mom dead in an overpass collapse\u2014that\u2019s a waste. That makes everything Kara and Anna are doing to me nothing. Or it should.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cThe heat\u2019s going to break,\u201d I say feebly. I already said that. And then I do something really stupid and I say it again. \u201cThe heat\u2019s going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He uncurls his fingers from their painful death grip on the table, takes a shaky breath in, and pushes his plate away. I wonder if a moment like this can be salvaged. After a long, long silence, he takes another shaky breath in and goes, \u201cSo what do your parents do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey work at a call center in Colfer.\u201d It\u2019s a relief to be able to say something that doesn\u2019t sound so stupid this time. \u201cThe commute\u2019s a killer. I hardly ever see them, but they\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>He nods and looks out the window. The meal is over. I hail Angie, who brings us the bill. We both reach into our pockets at the same time. I hold my hand up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Michael says. \u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>It becomes a race of who can get into their drenched, stiff pocket first. I win. Michael\u2019s got a whole wallet to contend with, but I deal in crumpled dollar bills. I hand them to Angie and tell her to take her tip out of the change. It\u2019s still raining, not as hard as before but steady. I get to my feet, and Michael follows me out of the diner and back into it. I stretch my hands out and feel the rain against my palm.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve been to Val\u2019s,\u201d I say. \u201cNow you can say you\u2019ve done everything, unless you haven\u2019t done the bowling alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done the bowling alley,\u201d he mutters. His shoulders are hunched and he\u2019s got his hands in his pocket. I can tell he feels bad about what happened, and I don\u2019t want him to feel bad about what happened, so I keep my voice light.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the pool hall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArcade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even once.\u201d</p><p>I force a smile. \u201cSo what do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Now ask me why.\u201d</p><p>I stop. He stops. He\u2019s rigid, tense. I get it. He\u2019s embarrassed, and everything about him is asking for a distraction. He\u2019s chosen a fight. I should give him one as a favor, but there\u2019s nothing between me and school without Michael there, and more than that, I don\u2019t want to fight him. I just want to tell him how sorry I am.</p><p>But I swallow it and it settles in my stomach with the guilt that\u2019s always there. We walk in silence after that, leaving the main street for the back roads. The rain turns to spit, and eventually we turn down Hutt Avenue, and I guess that\u2019s it. We\u2019ll end up at his place, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be inviting me in.</p><p>I want him to invite me in.</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cMichael\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about me,\u201d he says abruptly. He slows as we reach his place. The weather, the rain, it makes his house look emptier than it did before. Like, nothing about it looks remotely homey. But people live here. Michael lives here. That\u2019s sad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Michael.\u201d</p><p>He takes a step back. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The repeat is always the killer. Everything inside you goes into saying the word once, but sorry is the kind of word the person you say it to always wants to hear twice. \u201cFor what I did to you. I\u2019m sorry. I just wanted you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He takes another step away from me and another, up the path. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it. You\u2019re not sorry; you\u2019re guilty. That\u2019s why Liz didn\u2019t forgive you. Because you just feel sorry for yourself.\u201d My mouth drops open and he nods. \u201cYeah, she told me you apologized. Even she knew it. You don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew she wouldn\u2019t forgive me.\u201d</p><p>He keeps moving away from me, digging into his pockets for his house key. \u201cThen why did you even say it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I meant it,\u201d I say pathetically. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a good person and I\u2019ll never be a good person, so who cares if I meant it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou finally get it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you really cared, then why didn\u2019t you tell my mom what you did to Liz? Because you didn\u2019t, did you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. The thunder rolls, distant, the storm moving out or coming back in. I don\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell her about what you did to me,\u201d he says. \u201cSo what did you tell her about? How could she possibly have helped you if you just sat there and lied to her? You wasted her time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her about Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoward,\u201d he spits.</p><p>My eyes fill with tears. He takes another few steps to the front door. I bet he\u2019s going to relish the weekend. There\u2019ll be no stupid, crazy, needy, antacid-popping girl hanging off him in a building full of people who didn\u2019t give him a chance because of some stupid, crazy, needy, antacid-popping girl.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have apologized to you,\u201d I say.</p><p>He stops, but he doesn\u2019t come back. \u201cNo, you should have. A long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo do you actually think we could be friends, or do you think I\u2019m just tolerating you, or do you think I feel sorry for you?

Why wouldn\u2019t you tell me to fuck off if you hate me that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted to call you a bitch to your face, and I wanted to make you uncomfortable, and I wanted to see you suffer up close, that\u2019s why. God, maybe I\u2019m as bad as\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stops. There\u2019s this stunned silence. I\u2019m as bad as you. I want to dare him to say it. He\u2019s as bad as me, and Kara\u2019s as bad as me, and I\u2019m as bad as Anna, who killed all the things that were good about me before they got the chance to do any good.</p> <p>\u201cI ruin lives\u2014I get it,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be told over and over and over.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and walks the path to the porch, and I watch him for a minute, and then I make my way home, and it rains the whole way there.</p><p>It rains the whole weekend .</p><p>... Starts off with a bang, a buzz .</p><p>Lynn Parks gets caught doing lines of something Josh sold her in the girls\u2019 room. Josh spends the morning sweating until word gets around she\u2019s not talking. Holt works fast and furiously. A new rule is implemented: Students will have to sign out of class to go to the bathroom, and if they haven\u2019t returned within ten minutes, they will be retrieved.</p><p>Which is stupid, because I could do, like, a million drugs in ten minutes.</p> <p>Effective immediately, there will be no more loitering in the washrooms at lunch. No more seeking refuge there during class. The teachers will make sure of this. This could not have happened at a worse time, because I\u2019m pretty sure Michael has revoked his invitation for me to sit with him at lunch and I need a place to hide. My brain is having a hard time accepting life in school without a space where I can disappear.</p><p>It comes to me\u2014that storage room Anna and I had to get the volleyball net from. Josh and I used to meet there and have impromptu make-out sessions sometimes. I lived for him against me under that forty-watt bulb, against a background of ratty old gym mats and leftover, broken equipment. I make my way through the halls, past people heading to the cafeteria and past Brenner, who is hovering outside the boys\u2019 washroom.</p><p>Usually, the storage rooms in the school are locked, because the administration values paper and athletics equipment more than its students, but this one is always open. No one steals or would want to steal mats. I step inside and turn the light on. I\u2019ll have to use this space only when I really need it, until the memory of Lynn snorting things up her nose fades and the teachers remember how not to care.</p><p>My new hiding space secured, I wander the halls, waiting for the bell to ring, a strange nervousness in my gut. This is what being really alone feels like. I take an antacid. And another one.</p><p>\u201cRegina?\u201d</p><p>I hate myself because his voice gives me hope in the place in my stomach that\u2019s most anxious, and then I hate myself even more because when I turn, seeing him makes that feeling worse. Or better. I don\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cI was looking all over for you,\u201d Michael says, causing another desperate, hopeful twinge in my gut. \u201cI wanted to talk to you. About last Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should hang around each other anymore.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t try to soften it or anything; he just says it. I don\u2019t think we should hang around each other anymore. Before I can even try to get a grip on it, he\u2019s saying more things I don\u2019t really want to hear.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t fair to you. I let you sit with me at lunch and I let you do it for the wrong reasons and I should\u2019ve known better\u2014\u201d He pauses. \u201c\u2014Even if you deserved it.\u201d</p><p>My mouth goes dry. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegina...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just think it would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Michael,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d He trails off. I don\u2019t even understand why he\u2019s still talking, because I said it was fine. \u201cAnd you\u2019re really in it, and I just think it\u2019s bullshit. It\u2019s a waste of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll see you\u2014\u201d I laugh. \u201cOh, wait. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to give you a reason\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life is bullshit. I got that part. And I deserve it. You don\u2019t need to say anymore. I got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cKara and Anna\u2014total bullshit. Got it. And Donnie? That was total\u2014\u201d</p><p>I press my fingers to my lips before I realize what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s like my body won\u2019t accept calling it bullshit because it wasn\u2019t. What Donnie did to me is still with me. It doesn\u2019t go away. A horrified realization crawls across Michael\u2019s face, because he didn\u2019t think that far back, which is okay, because I didn\u2019t deserve that.</p><p>But it hurts.</p><p>\u201cRegina\u2014\u201d He sounds stunned, like he can\u2019t believe he has to backtrack on his awesome speech about how my life is such bullshit. \u201cRegina, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I repeat, stepping around him. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me anything.\u201d</p><p>And then Kara shoves me .</p><p>It happens like this: I\u2019m heading to class, I walk past her, she shoves me. My books go flying, which is the point, because then she kicks them down the hall. And there\u2019s nothing spectacular about it, even though everyone around us seems to think otherwise. I get my books\u2014by the time I reach them, they\u2019ve been trampled\u2014and walk away without looking back, and then that little voice in my head:</p><p>Do something.</p><p>The bell rings. I circle the hall. I circle it again, thinking. How does Anna weigh the crimes against the punishments? \u201cSleeping\u201d with Donnie is worth my total destruction, and Anna thought I was worth Liz\u2019s total destruction, so I look at my books and try to guess how much they\u2019re worth. They\u2019re bent, battered. And I have to factor in embarrassment, too, because it was mildly embarrassing.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I stand there contemplating it before I realize I\u2019m standing directly in front of Kara\u2019s locker. I\u2019ve been standing in front of Kara\u2019s locker.</p><p>Eleven, twenty-seven, three, ten. Her combination. I\u2019ve been armed with it since that day she unexpectedly got her period and had to hole herself up in the bathroom while I got her a tampon. Eleven, twenty-seven, three, ten. My hands tremble. I grab the lock.</p><p>Eleven, twenty-seven, three, ten.</p><p>It comes undone. I open it. Kara\u2019s locker is painfully neat. The inside of the door is decorated with photos of her after she lost the weight, but none from before. There are group shots of her with Marta, Jeanette, and Anna, and jagged edges mark the places she ripped me away. My eyes drift past her books\u2014they could go into the pool, maybe\u2014to the personal affects lining the shelves, the things you stick in your locker to help you forget you\u2019re in school every time you open it up. I grab everything quickly. This is total suicide, and she\u2019ll know it was me. But I don\u2019t care.</p><p>It takes me three trips to get everything to the garbage two halls over.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, I feel empty, but only for a second. Because I get it; I do. I get why Anna was my best friend. Why I couldn\u2019t be friends with Liz and why I couldn\u2019t save her and why I couldn\u2019t eat. Why Kara hates me. Why Michael can\u2019t be around me. Kara lost the weight. It didn\u2019t matter. Same school, same teachers, same classmates, same friends. No chance. In high school, you don\u2019t get to change. You only get to walk variations of the same lines everyone has already drawn for you.</p><p>So I should just make the best of it.</p><p>I\u2019m not even going to bother getting out of bed today .</p><p>Anna, Kara, and Marta are huddled behind the front doors .</p><p>It\u2019s the first cold day since the heat broke. I stand in the parking lot, waiting for the bell to ring or Jeanette to show, whichever comes first. When they move out, I\u2019ll be able to go in. I wait and wait. My hands are numb and I\u2019m shivering. A blue Saturn and a black convertible pull in at the same time. Anna. Kara. Marta. Michael. Donnie. The moment becomes a contest: Who do I want to avoid more?</p><p>Donnie. The others didn\u2019t have their hands on me like he did. I take a deep breath and push the door open. Maybe if I keep my gaze level and stare straight ahead, the girls won\u2019t engage.</p><p>\u201cRegina.\u201d</p><p>I jerk my head in their direction. Anna and Kara stand shoulder-to-shoulder, Marta slightly behind them. I\u2019m stuffing an antacid into my mouth before I can get my brain to tell my stomach to be stronger than that. Anna\u2019s mouth quirks.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Kara steps forward. Every time she asserts herself, it\u2019s unbelievable: I can\u2019t wrap my head around how comfortable she looks. How she can just grow into that skin when she\u2019s spent years cowering and being stupid and worthless.</p><p>\u201cI know you were the one who fucked up my locker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d my voice breaks, instant giveaway. I hate this. I used to own her. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about....\u201d</p><p>Kara takes two steps forward. I take two steps back. Anna oversees us, her arms crossed. She loves this. She loves every second of this.</p><p>\u201cI know it was you,\u201d Kara says.</p><p>She takes two more steps forward, forcing me to back up. Everything about her is predatory, from the curve of her mouth to the glint in her eyes. She takes a quick step forward, and I leap back at the same time the door swings open and nails me in the back, knocking the wind out of me. I stumble forward, glimpsing Jeanette. She high-fives Kara, and the entrance congests. Donnie and Michael and a few others are trying to make it through, and they witnessed the whole thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s always an audience.</p><p>The worst part is, I have to sit down. Right there. My back hurts and I can\u2019t breathe. I move to the corner like a gasping, injured dog and sit on the floor, trying really hard for air. Not getting any.</p><p>\u201cI know you fucked up my locker,\u201d she repeats. \u201cDon\u2019t think for a second we\u2019re finished.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never for a second thought that,\u201d I wheeze.</p><p>They clomp past me. I close my eyes and imagine myself on Tuesday, in bed, where there was this brief moment between waking up and being totally awake where my mind was completely empty and it was so peaceful.</p><p>When I open my eyes, I can breathe again and everyone is gone but Michael.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cGet away from me, Michael.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. That looked really painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be happy. You totally just got to see me suffer up close.\u201d</p><p>He pales and slinks off, and it\u2019s satisfying, but it doesn\u2019t last. It never does.</p><p>Brenner calls me up to the board to solve some complicated equation</p><p>he\u2019s spent the last ten minutes chalking out, even though I\u2019m not wearing a skirt or a low-cut top. I don\u2019t know the answer, so I have to stand there staring blankly at numbers until he tells me to sit down again. On my way back to my desk, Kara forces her chair out, slamming it into my side.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d She pushes herself to her feet so the hard plastic edges dig into my skin on her way up. \u201cI\u2019m so...\u201d</p> <p>Sorry. She never says it, but Brenner acts like he heard it, and that\u2019s the end of it. I rub my side, biting my lower lip. Kara smirks and sits, satisfied.</p><p>I want to push her down a flight of stairs.</p><p>I actually stake out a staircase between periods so I can do it. It seems so reasonable. It seems so fair. Kara comes this way for her next class and all I have to do is trip her from the side or get her from behind, like she got me, and down she goes. I lean against the wall and wait. By the time the crowded hall thins out, I\u2019m salivating. It looks so good in my head. I have to make it happen. I need to make it happen.</p><p>So of course she never comes.</p><p>The bell rings and I sit down on the stairs, a slowly deflating balloon. When the bloodlust finally fades, I feel stupid. I stay on the steps for a long time, until Liz rounds the corner. Our eyes meet. There must be no other way for her to get to where she wants to go, because she sighs and begins the trudge up. Every time I see her now, I see her suicide and it makes me want to puke. She passes me. I listen to the sound of her heels as they clack down the hall. Then they stop and clack back.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to be around her. People have to live with things they don\u2019t want to live with all the time, but\u2014how? After Liz, every time I ate, I tasted guilt, and I don\u2019t know why. What I did to Kara didn\u2019t make me sick. What would Dr. Hayden have told me if I\u2019d been brave enough to tell her the truth about me, that I was just as bad as Anna? Dr. Hayden listened to my select truths and said the right things\u2014 Anna was the bad one\u2014until I almost believed it wasn\u2019t me, and then I discovered antacids, like that was my problem all long, and I could eat again, and it took me the rest of the way. I never thought it would catch up with me before I graduated.</p><p>\u201cMichael told me he told you about\u2014\u201d She stops. \u201c\u2014What I did.\u201d</p><p>I look up at her. Liz is vaguely intimidating from this angle. She looks sort of mad, nose up, even though she\u2019s staring me down.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI never wanted you to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never wanted to know that.\u201d</p><p>I lean my head against the wall and wait for her to go. She doesn\u2019t.</p><p>She crosses her arms. \u201cHave you gotten used to it yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get used to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you think I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry we\u2019re not friends,\u201d I tell her. I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we were. I never thought I\u2019d be your claim to fame. From the boring, bitchy, popular girls to the kind that go that extra mile to make people\u2019s lives hell. After me, you guys were all set. Anna owes me, when you think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t try cashing out, if I were you,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She rolls her eyes and walks away.</p><p>By the end of the day, my body is all bruises and scratches. My back, the door. My side, the chair. Jeanette sits behind me in English class and jabs me in the shoulders with the sharp end of her pencil until the period is over, and I just sit there and take it.</p><p>Dodgeball.</p><p>Nelson splits the class down the middle, and the divide is such that she can\u2019t be as stupid as she looks. I think she\u2019s just as bored as the rest of us, because Kara, Anna, and Josh are on one team, and I get stuck with Bruce and Donnie and Michael.</p><p>Maximum entertainment value.</p><p>In elementary school, we had a Safe Ball. It was this soft, foamy thing that didn\u2019t hurt at all but still managed to strike fear into your heart when someone caught it and took aim. It felt so personal.</p><p>Now we\u2019ve grown up and graduated to hard rubber.</p><p>I\u2019m nervous, but in a good way. I want to move. I want to hurt them. I\u2019m a horrible person; they\u2019re horrible people too. We might as well take each other. Anna and Kara whisper to Josh and Bruce, who hangs around until Nelson shouts us into positions, then Bruce wanders to my side of the court, glaring.</p><p>Everyone gets into place. We\u2019re using one ball today, not six. Organized chaos. Anna\u2019s team gets the ball first, and then it goes to Mehmet Erdogan, who whips the ball at Donnie, who doesn\u2019t even try to dodge it. Nelson blows her whistle. He\u2019s out. Bruce grabs the ball and gives it a hard throw in Josh\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Josh yells.</p><p>\u201cIn it to win it,\u201d Bruce says, and there\u2019s an edge to his voice. I bet he\u2019s pissed about Josh and Anna. I glance at Josh. He frowns, retrieves the ball, and sends it Bruce\u2019s way, hard. Bruce catches it and aims for Josh.</p><p>\u201cYou guys,\u201d Anna says, amused. She knows exactly what\u2019s going on. Bruce sends the ball at Baz Jones. It hits her thigh. She shrieks and heads for the side. I\u2019m impatient at this point. One of them has to eventually take a shot at me.</p><p>I beat Samantha Mantle to the ball and throw it at Kara before she realizes I\u2019m aiming at her. It whaps her in the chest. She staggers back, startled, and no one can call me on it because that\u2019s the game.</p><p>But the whole room goes quiet because they know it\u2019s more than a game.</p><p>Nelson blows her whistle. \u201cOff the court, Myers!\u201d</p><p>Kara marches to the sidelines. It\u2019s the most exciting thing that happens for a while. I dodge the ball and watch more people get taken out. I\u2019m disappointed when Anna takes an unexpected hit from Megan Gunter. I wanted to do that.</p><p>The numbers dwindle slowly. Michael and I stay alive by keeping close to the back of the gym. We have the edge on the other side. Josh is all over, untouchable. He\u2019s always good at weaseling away from a hit. Each time I get the ball, I make him my target, until it\u2019s so obvious, he backs into the corner of the gym because I can\u2019t throw that far.</p><p>And then the game gets a whole lot more boring.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Josh,\u201d I call. \u201cThe game\u2019s up here.\u201d</p><p>Josh scowls but he stays in his corner.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push it,\u201d Michael says. He sounds close.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d But when I turn around, he\u2019s already walking away from me. I focus on Josh and shout for him to \u201cman up,\u201d because I need to hit something with a ball and he\u2019s all that\u2019s left.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Regina,\u201d Anna snaps. \u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d I say exaggeratedly, \u201cso cute, Anna. I\u2019m sure Josh appreciates it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much talking and not enough playing,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cGet up the court, Carey. I don\u2019t grade you if you don\u2019t play.\u201d</p><p>Josh\u2019s face turns red. He takes a couple steps forward. The ball goes back and forth and nobody\u2019s out. Back and forth. Back and forth. Back and forth. Josh edges back to his corner. I make an exasperated noise.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Josh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone, Regina,\u201d Anna shouts from the side. \u201cMs. Nelson\u2014\u201d</p><p>The toss of the ball interrupts her, and then\u2014Michael\u2019s out. Whitney Lodge gets him, and it\u2019s one of those blink-almost-missed-its, where the ball maybe grazed his ankle, but no one can really say for sure. But with Anna and Kara insisting \u201cIt totally hit his ankle we saw it he\u2019s out we saw it,\u201d Nelson calls it. Bruce retrieves the ball.</p><p>\u201cI was having so much fun, too,\u201d Michael mutters, making his way off court. I head back to my corner.</p><p>And then the room explodes.</p><p>I don\u2019t see it. It happens around me. Behind me. Noise. Lots of noise. At first I think it\u2019s me because it\u2019s near me, but it\u2019s not me. Nelson blurs past me to get to\u2014I whirl around\u2014to get to...Michael.</p><p>I was standing here, Donnie was over there clutching his face, and there was blood. Lots of blood. Now I\u2019m standing here and Michael\u2019s there and there\u2019s lots of blood and he\u2019s clutching his face. But where Donnie was loud, Michael is quiet.</p><p>Nelson compensates by blowing her whistle so hard it pops out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cBURTON\u2014OFF COURT! PRINCIPAL\u2019S OFFICE! NOW!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Nelson,\u201d he protests, \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She blows her whistle and he shuts his mouth. \u201cYou did that deliberately, Burton. Get down to the principal\u2019s office now.\u201d</p><p>Bruce swears under his breath, earning another blow of the whistle, and pushes through the doors so hard they hit the wall. Nelson goes to Michael, and it really hits me.</p><p>He\u2019s hurt.</p><p>I hurry over while Nelson checks him out. Once you\u2019ve seen one bloody nose, you\u2019ve seen them all, but this is different. It\u2019s Michael. It doesn\u2019t look good on him. \u201cIs it broken?\u201d I ask. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Michael sniffs. \u201cHe didn\u2019t hit me that hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHayden, get to the nurse\u2019s office and clean up. Afton, escort your friend down there.\u201d Nelson turns to the rest of the gym. \u201cWhat is wrong with you people lately? This is a gym, not a battleground!\u201d</p><p>I follow Michael out of the gym. We walk the hall in silence. He keeps his palm pressed against his nose, switching hands every now and then, trying not to get blood on the floor. I think about what Nelson said. Friend. Hilarious.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll just clean up in the washroom,\u201d Michael says. He sounds stuffy.</p><p>I push open a familiar blue door. \u201cHere\u2019s one.\u201d He stops. \u201cNo way. That\u2019s the girls\u2019 room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>I push the door open and check every stall twice. The coast is clear. I ignore his protests, grab his hand, and drag him inside. I wedge the garbage can under the doorknob for added security. When I face Michael, he\u2019s hunched over the sink, gazing at his reflection in the mirror. I\u2019m not sure why I didn\u2019t just let him take care of it himself. Maybe because being around him means not being alone.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s not broken?\u201d</p> <p>He runs his hand over his nose. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think he just hit it the right way. Looks worse than it is.\u201d</p><p>I grope for something to say, trying to piece together what happened while my back was turned. Bruce hit Michael with the ball. Deliberately. Michael said something. Michael had to have said something to make him do that.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce. Why did he throw the ball at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t. He threw it at you,\u201d Michael says. \u201cHe threw it at you as soon as your back was turned. I intercepted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo it\u2019s my fault,\u201d I say stupidly. \u201cIt\u2019s totally your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. All through gym class, you were out to kill. They were laughing at you the whole time, and you didn\u2019t even notice. It was dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>He points to his nose. \u201cNeither is this.\u201d</p><p>He turns on the tap. I make my way over, and we reach for the paper towels at the same time. I push his hand away, rip off a swath, and pat the counter space between the sinks. He hesitates and then hoists himself up, and I wet the towel and hesitate before dabbing at the fresh and drying blood on his face. My hand trembles. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m doing it. Maybe because I\u2019m glad he stood between me and Bruce and I don\u2019t know how to tell him I\u2019m glad he stood between me and Bruce.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cI probably wasn\u2019t fair to you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold still.\u201d He stills. I keep dabbing at his face. I dab until he stops bleeding and there\u2019s no blood and it\u2019s all off his face. But he\u2019s on to me. He takes my wrist and lowers my hand, and I know talking will ruin this, whatever this is.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I said about bullshit...wasting time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you meant. Forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what Donnie did to you wasn\u2019t bullshit. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d He stares up at the ceiling, quiet for a moment. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t hang around a lot of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I know everything. \u201cBecause of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Well, yeah, but what happened at the diner was weird, and that it happened with you was even weirder.\u201d He pauses. \u201cAnd then you capped it off with that apology and it was\u2014it just made me really angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you angry,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t....\u201d He clears his throat again and looks at me. \u201cAnd I believe you when you say you\u2019re sorry, but it\u2019s so much easier for me to think of you as a total bitch, you have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m a total bitch?\u201d</p><p>I wish I could take it back as soon as it\u2019s out of my mouth. It\u2019s embarrassing. I have to look away from him. But I can\u2019t even describe what that feels like\u2014that there was a moment where Michael didn\u2019t hate me for what I did to him.</p><p>It makes me feel human.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cBut I feel like that\u2019s what I have to keep doing....\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t hold that against him. I get how important the illusion is. If the difference between Michael thinking of me as a total bitch and not thinking of me as a total bitch is him trying his hardest not to cry at a restaurant, hurting over his dead mother\u2014I\u2019d think of me as a bitch, too.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want her to know how mean I was,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom.\u201d I try to swallow and can\u2019t. \u201cBecause she was so nice and warm and funny and caring and she listened, and I just wanted her to like me, because everyone here hates me, and the people that didn\u2019t, like Anna, made me hate myself. So I...just wanted her to think I was good. And I didn\u2019t tell her about what I did to you or Liz because I really, really liked her and I didn\u2019t want her to hate me too.\u201d</p><p>He gets the saddest look on his face.</p><p>\u201cRegina, she wouldn\u2019t have hated you,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if she knew, I doubt she would\u2019ve hated you. She wouldn\u2019t have been happy, but she would have helped you....\u201d</p><p>His breath catches in his throat, like he just realized it: She wouldn\u2019t have hated me and she would\u2019ve helped me. And I don\u2019t know if he hates knowing that or not. He\u2019s still holding my wrist, his fingers pulsing against my skin. I stay still because I know if I move it will stop. I don\u2019t want it to stop.</p><p>What changes a moment like this.</p><p>I move forward, tentatively, and his hand stays on my wrist. It\u2019s going to be a kiss. Even if he hates it. One of those out-of-nowhere kisses. It has to be.</p><p>I want it to be.</p><p>He moves closer\u2014</p><p>And then he stops.</p><p>We stare at each other, and I want to ask him why, but before I can gather the nerve, he slides off the counter and we\u2019re closer than ever. He exhales slowly and edges away. He moves the garbage can and leaves the washroom, and I stay there too long, my stomach all twisted up, until I\u2019m caught by Ms. Crager, who\u2019s on washroom duty.</p><p>Strike one, she tells me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive you to school today.\u201d</p><p>I choke on my coffee. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive you to school today,\u201d Mom says, and I\u2019m all over it, protesting\u2014 no, it\u2019s okay, forget it \u2014when she holds up her hand. \u201cNo arguments, Regina.\u201d</p><p>I get the kind of uneasy feeling that begs for an antacid. This cannot mean anything good. I finish my coffee, get my things, and follow Mom to her car. It\u2019s total silence as she pulls out of the driveway, and then when we hit the road she says, \u201cWe have a meeting with your principal today. It should be fun.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and lean my head against the seat, and the word fuck just repeats itself over and over in my head, because fuck.</p><p>\u201cSo do you want to tell me what\u2019s going on before we get there, or do I have to play twenty questions with your principal? Because I don\u2019t have the time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d I open my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCutting so many classes in such a short amount of time isn\u2019t nothing, Regina. Your father and I are very concerned. We don\u2019t know where you go, what you\u2019re up to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone spray-painted the word whore on my locker, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><p>She actually stops the car. Pulls over and turns it off. She stares at me, looking equal parts disbelieving and devastated.</p><p>\u201cSomeone spray-painted the word whore on your locker? Who? Who would do something like that to you? Why didn\u2019t you tell me? When? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>The last part sounds the worst. Like it really bothers her that I didn\u2019t tell her. I\u2019m sure it does, but I feel bad enough as it is, and I need to organize my thoughts enough to lie, because I\u2019m not interested in dealing with the truth and feeling even worse. I just need her to go into Holt\u2019s office on my side, feeling sorry enough for me to forgive me if I miss more days after this. And I\u2019m sure I will.</p><p>\u201cIt was a few weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>She starts spluttering. I cut her off before she can start demanding answers to questions I haven\u2019t prepared answers for. \u201cI didn\u2019t...tell you because it was embarrassing. I mean, who wants to tell their mom something like that?\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms and try for a petulant teenage look. Like it doesn\u2019t bother me. Like being reminded of it every time I open up my stupid red locker doesn\u2019t bother me.</p><p>\u201cWho did it?\u201d she demands. \u201cWhat did the school do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Holt had my locker repainted.\u201d</p><p>Mom sighs and rests her head against the steering wheel, and then I feel really bad. Really, really bad. I look out the window. After she\u2019s had her moment, she reaches over and squeezes my shoulder. Like a mom.</p><p>\u201cOh, Regina...\u201d</p><p>My throat tightens. She sounds really\u2014like she cares. I mean, I know she does, but I haven\u2019t heard that in anyone\u2019s voice in a long time.</p><p>\u201cI just hate being there,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWell, what about your friends?\u201d Mom asks. \u201cAnna, Kara...Josh\u2014Josh must be a help, right? You have your friends....\u201d God.</p><p>The last thing I expect to do\u2014cry. In the car, next to my mom. And it\u2019s the best and worst thing I could do. The best because I have her like that, and the worst because my tears have this stranglehold on me. Now that I\u2019m crying, it\u2019s all I want to do. I want to scream and really let it out. Instead, I stare out the window with tears streaming down my face. Stop. Stop it. Get a grip, Regina.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t like...\u201d Mom hesitates. \u201cShould we be calling someone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cI just hate being there sometimes, and sometimes I have to leave. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She presses her lips together. She starts the car, and then we\u2019re back on the road, and she says, \u201cI\u2019m going to take some time. We\u2019ll have a day.\u201d</p><p>Like that would solve anything.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say.</p> <p>I check my face in the mirror. My eyes are red and swollen. Mom parks across the road from the school. We make our way across the school parking lot, and this is as close to invincible as I get: No one\u2019s going to touch the girl who brings her mom to school. I get so preoccupied with how dumb I must look right now, I follow her into the front corridor, where Anna and Kara are waiting. I\u2019m heart-stopped, frozen, and Mom\u2019s warm and smiling, asking them how the semester\u2019s been treating them.</p><p>\u201cLook at you girls!\u201d She has Anna by the hands, stepping back so she can get a good look. Anna grins at her, and Kara smirks at me, her eyebrow arched. \u201cYou\u2019re almost out there, huh? Graduating and heading into the real world!\u201d</p><p>Anna laughs. \u201cLong time no see, Mrs. A.\u201d</p><p>But it\u2019s the way she says it. Mom\u2019s face changes as Anna\u2019s words sink in, making her a picture of polite puzzlement. She looks at me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Regina, where have you been keeping your friends?\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019re not my friends.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s senior year,\u201d Anna says. \u201cYou know how it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaguely,\u201d Mom says, laughing.</p><p>Anna and Kara laugh in unison. Pretty-girl-nightmare-robots. \u201cMom, we have to see Holt,\u201d I say. A flicker of something\u2014 panic?\u2014crosses Anna\u2019s face. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Mom finally drops Anna\u2019s hands and gives her a parting smile. \u201cRight. Well, I\u2019ll see you girls again sometime soon, I hope.\u201d</p><p>Anna\u2019s eyes are on me. \u201cThat\u2019d be nice, Mrs. A.\u201d</p> <p>Mom turns her back to us and heads up the stairs. Anna grabs my arm and jerks me back, digging her nails into my skin. I wince.</p><p>\u201cYou tell Holt anything, and you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>I slap her in the face with my free hand. I\u2019m not even thinking. Pure instinct. Slap. And a strange thrill courses through me, because it felt that good. Kara gasps, and Anna drops my arm, and I watch her shocked face cycle through every shade of red there is, because I just slapped her.</p><p>\u201cRegina, are you coming?\u201d</p><p>Mom stands at the top of the stairs, waiting. She missed it. I hurry up the stairs after her, my heart in my throat. I\u2019m dead. I am dead. All through the meeting with Holt, I run my index finger over the tingling palm of my right hand, the one that slapped her, and I try to focus, but it\u2019s impossible because I am so dead. Mom and Holt talk about me, volleying each other toward some kind of resolution or something. I don\u2019t know.</p><p>All I know is I slapped Anna across the face.</p><p>\u201cHow does that sound, Regina?\u201d Holt asks, jarring me out of my thoughts. He and Mom stare at me expectantly. I have no idea what anyone just said.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say.</p> <p>They smile. Good. They stand. They shake hands. Good. The meeting is over and it was good. I lead Mom out of the office and past Arnett, who is working diligently at her desk, to the front corridor, where she gives me a long hug and a kiss on the forehead, pushes open the door, and steps outside.</p><p>Into the \u201creal world.\u201d</p><p>The halls are empty. It\u2019s lunch .</p><p>I\u2019ve been skulking around corners, hiding in shadows, trying to avoid everyone, because everyone knows I slapped Anna in the face. I\u2019m guessing Kara let it slip, because Anna would never tell anyone that story unless it ended with her kicking my ass. So far, I haven\u2019t managed to meet up with them since it happened. That\u2019s good. If I can get through the rest of the day without that happening, that would be great.</p><p>\u201cAre you suicidal?\u201d</p><p>I jump out of my skin. The last person I expect to see\u2014Josh. He\u2019s alone and he wants to know: Am I suicidal?</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Josh,\u201d I say. I remember the day he asked me out. I needed him to help me set up Liz\u2019s locker so it wouldn\u2019t open with or without the lock, because Anna told me to. That kind of says it all.</p><p>\u201cSlapping Anna in the face? You must be,\u201d he says. \u201cBy the way, I liked that stunt you pulled in the gym the other day. Dodgeball. \u2018Man up, Josh.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms. \u201cI really liked it, too.\u201d</p><p>Josh shifts his book from one arm to the other. \u201cYou\u2019re just making things difficult for yourself. If you keep it up, Anna\u2019s gonna kill you.\u201d I wonder how far he\u2019s gotten with her. \u201cHaving fun with your new girlfriend?\u201d I ask. He smirks. \u201cMore than I had with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m halfway down the hall when a minicrowd surges out of the cafeteria. I duck into an alcove by the water fountain. It could be Kara, Anna, Marta, Jeanette. Any of them. The crowd passes by and it\u2019s none of them, but the group of students spot me as they pass, and I hear a buzz of recognition. \u201cThat\u2019s the girl who slapped Anna Morrison in the face.\u201d I wonder if I even have a name to these people anymore.</p><p>When the coast is clear, I continue my way down the hall. More people come out of the cafeteria in little fits, and I keep ducking into corners whenever I can.</p><p>I just need to get down this fucking hallway alive. That\u2019s it.</p><p>\u201cI take it the rumors are true.\u201d</p><p>I turn around and Michael\u2019s behind me. My gaze goes straight to his lips. We almost kissed. I actually have to fight those words from coming out of my mouth, and then I have to fight to keep a blush off my cheeks because I actually have to fight to keep those words from coming out of my mouth.</p><p>I don\u2019t understand what happened between us, but I really, really want to.</p><p>I nod and lean against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, and then I laugh. I didn\u2019t believe it before, but now I really, really don\u2019t believe it. \u201cI slapped her, Michael, I just\u2014did. I\u2019m so dead.\u201d</p><p>He leans beside me. There is no trace of the bloody nose he was sporting yesterday. He\u2019s wearing a blue sweater, and it really brings out his eyes. He runs a hand through his hair, pushing the brown strands away before they fall back across his face. He looks good. This is a stupid time to notice something like that, but I\u2019m a dying woman right now and we almost kissed so I guess it\u2019s allowed.</p><p>\u201cWho came into school with you this morning? Was that your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a meeting with Holt,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m missing too much school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut are you really missing it?\u201d</p><p>I smile weakly. \u201cI seriously think I need to go into hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Friday. Maybe she\u2019ll cool off over the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna doesn\u2019t cool off,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat are you doing out here, anyway? Shouldn\u2019t you be in the cafeteria, writing in your Moleskine or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard what happened.\u201d He doesn\u2019t look at me. \u201cI wanted to make sure you weren\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead?\u201d I ask. He nods. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not. But the day is still young. All I have to do is step down a deserted hallway alone, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll jump me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t walk down any deserted hallways alone, then.\u201d</p><p>Another group forces its way out of the cafeteria. Lunch must be winding up. It makes me nervous, but it\u2019s not so bad standing next to Michael. It\u2019s safe here, in the hall next to him. I close my eyes and try to enjoy that feeling while I can.</p><p>\u201cI could walk you to your classes,\u201d he offers. I open my eyes. \u201cAnd meet you outside of them when you\u2019re done...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said we shouldn\u2019t hang around each other anymore?\u201d I say, and his expression makes it immediately clear that I shouldn\u2019t have. \u201cOh. You still think that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou helped me yesterday....\u201d he explains. \u201cThe least I can do is help you get through a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to get better,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut thanks.\u201d</p><p>He gives me this look. \u201cRegina, just let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I walk away before he can say anything else. I feel stupid. Like he\u2019d actually want to hang around me. No. He just doesn\u2019t want to owe me anything.</p><p>The bell rings. No traces of Anna or Kara. I wish I\u2019d known I was going to do it\u2014slap her. I would\u2019ve relished it more.</p><p>I would have hit her harder.</p><p>Reg-</p><p>This is getting boring. We need to talk. If you want out of this, meet me in the paper supply closet at lunch.</p><p>\u2014A</p><p>There are a lot of ways I expect Monday to go. This is not one of them.</p><p>The note is wedged in the slates of my locker. When I open it and see her handwriting, everything stops. The lunch bell rings, and the halls filter out until they\u2019re empty, and it\u2019s just me and those words and nothing else.</p><p>This is getting boring. We need to talk.</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it.</p><p>I want to believe it.</p><p>I unfold the note again and study her handwriting. It\u2019s definitely hers. The paper supply closet. It\u2019s not far from here.</p><p>Kara \u2018 s at the fountain when I turn down the hall to the supply closet. She\u2019s bent over, her hair dragging around the drain while she laps up the fluorinated water with her tongue, strongly reminding me of a French poodle. I pass her and hope she won\u2019t notice me, but she does. Of course. She straightens and wipes her mouth on the back of her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d she says.</p><p>The note from Anna circumvents any desire I have to smash my fist into Kara\u2019s face while there\u2019s no one around to witness it.</p><p>\u201cNice tooth,\u201d I tell her. \u201cThey almost color-matched it.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and turns down the hall. I listen as her footsteps get farther away. I reach the supply closet, stand in front of the door, and count to ten. I need to go into this looking right. Anna can see weakness, sense it, and I need to be calm. Calm.</p><p>I grab the doorknob and step inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s dark.</p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d</p><p>I take two steps forward and grope for the light overhead. My fingers find the bulb when something moves behind me. Anna. I turn. Not Anna. Kara. I rush the door, my shoulder connecting with it painfully, and I grab the doorknob just as she gives it a sharp jerk toward her, and then it\u2019s closed. The lock clicks into place.</p> <p>\u201cKara, don\u2019t\u2014Kara!\u201d She\u2019s locked me in. I pound on the door. \u201cKara, I swear to God, let me out or I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you\u2019ll what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d she says, laughing.</p><p>Set up. Set up by her again. I kick the door as hard as I can, choking back a scream until I realize screaming is exactly what I should be doing.</p> <p>\u201cSomebody let me out! Is there anyone out there? LET ME OUT!\u201d</p><p>Nothing. Everyone\u2019s in the cafeteria. I\u2019ll be stuck in here for at least thirty minutes before someone walks by. If someone walks by.</p><p>I need light.</p><p>I go back to fumbling for the chain and give it a yank. The feeble wattage sends a dull glow around the immediate area but leaves most of the room to the shadows. I wait and I wait, and when the lunch bell rings, I yell as loudly as I can, but no one comes.</p><p>No one comes, even though I can hear them all just outside the door.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting behind shelves of poster board with my back against the wall. It\u2019s been an hour. Maybe two. Every time I hear the slightest noise, I tense, preparing to be found. It never happens. I pick at my jeans, waiting. I have to go to the bathroom. I think I\u2019m edging up on hour three when the door finally opens. I scramble to my feet, but the ensuing grunting and scuffling sounds hold me back and keep me from revealing myself.</p> <p>\u201cFuck off! Get the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet his cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck off me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy. Don\u2019t make this harder than it has to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201d Fuck off!\u201d</p><p>I peer around the shelves. Bruce gives Donnie a hard shove, sending him to the floor. He eats ground and his eyes are on my feet. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s seeing me. I can make out Josh in the doorway. Henry.</p><p>\u201cGot his cell phone?\u201d Bruce asks.</p><p>Josh holds it up.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>No. Josh and Henry leave. No. Donnie tries to grope his way to his feet, but Bruce gives him a sharp kick in the ribs and he stays down. They don\u2019t know I\u2019m here. They can\u2019t know I\u2019m here. That would be too fucked up, even for us.</p><p>I stumble out from behind the shelf. Bruce isn\u2019t surprised to see me. \u201cOh, good,\u201d he says.</p><p>Oh my God. My heart sputters and dies. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2014Bruce\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun, kids.\u201d</p><p>I lunge for him and trip over Donnie in the process. I sprawl across the floor, my feet all tangled up in him. He swears at me and pushes at my legs, groaning. I get to my feet and crawl to the door just as it closes. Not this. Not this. I press my palms against the door, trying to catch my breath\u2014I can\u2019t breathe\u2014while Donnie gets to his feet.</p><p>Not this.</p><p>Bruce, Josh, and Henry laugh themselves down the hall. I curl my fingers against the door. His hand up my skirt. Mouth on my neck. Not happening. Not happening.</p><p>Not happening not happening not happening.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to turn around, Afton?\u201d</p><p>I need to run. I need to get up. Get up. Get up. I grab the doorknob and pull myself to my feet. I need out.</p><p>\u201cIf you touch me, I\u2019ll scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would hear you?\u201d</p><p>I turn. Donnie hovers at the edge of the light. A shadow falls across his face, adding a disturbing quality to his already grim exterior. Anna must love how badly he wears being an outcast. Or maybe he just looks this bad because he\u2019s sober.</p><p>I hope.</p><p>He moves in my direction. I shudder, feel my throat hitch. His hand up my skirt. He was on me. Kara knew what he did to me, she knew. I go back to the door, pounding it with my fists until they hurt. A voice inside my head tells me to scream, scream, scream now, scream loud, louder, and I keep thinking I am I\u2019m trying I\u2019m screaming.</p><p>But nothing is coming out of my mouth.</p><p>His hand is on my arms. He\u2019s behind me. Close. I jerk away and I do it too easily, which means he let me do it. He let me. He\u2019s fucking with me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to touch me,\u201d I say, backing away. I put a shelf between us. His footsteps are terrible and light, and I count them getting closer.</p><p>One. Two. Three.</p><p>\u201cYou never thought I was good enough,\u201d he says. Four. Five. Five footsteps. \u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t just let me have Anna. You loved to tell her I wasn\u2019t good enough for her either, all the time. Every single day.\u201d</p><p>I take five steps back, around the same shelf, past the useless locked door. I look around the room for something I can use. Paper. Poster board. I need something heavy.</p><p>Something.</p><p>\u201cEveryone hates me because of you,\u201d he says, quickening his pace. One-two-three. I step back one-two-three. \u201cI\u2019m not on the basketball team because of you. I get my ass kicked and locked in closets because of you\u2014\u201d</p><p>I grab a stack of paper. He bursts out laughing when he sees it and takes a quick step forward and back, faking me out. I stumble back, clutching the paper, and then he lunges at me for real and I throw it. Paper blizzard. It distracts him long enough for me to get to the other side of the shelf. All I have to do is keep this shelf between us for as long as we\u2019re in here, and we can\u2019t be in here together that much longer because these things don\u2019t happen twice\u2014where you need help and no one comes.</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck would you tell Kara?\u201d Donnie kicks at the paper. I flinch and he answers his own question. \u201cOh, right\u2014it\u2019s because you\u2019re a fucking bitch, that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>He shoves his hands between the free spaces in the shelves, reaching for me.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I beg. \u201cPlease\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He rounds the shelf, grinning. \u201cWhat have I got to lose?\u201d I back into the shelf, and its hard metal edge against my spine startles me forward. It\u2019s a split-second advantage and it\u2019s all Donnie needs. He grabs at me, just missing my arms. His fingers curl around my shirt. I hear the material give, tearing at the seam, up the side. My legs give.</p><p>He bends down and breathes on my neck.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he repeats in my ear. He puts his hand on my shoulder. I cover my mouth. He slips his hand past the collar of my shirt. I choke back a sob and try to crawl away from him, but he pulls me back. Hands on me. Touching me.</p><p>I throw up.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Donnie hisses, scrambling back. I scramble around the puddle of vomit, get myself up, and stumble toward the door. Open. Open. Open open open.</p><p>It opens.</p><p>Liz Cooper.</p><p>I shove past her before she can get a good look at my face. It\u2019s cold in the hall and I\u2019m shaking and I wrap my arms around myself but I can\u2019t stop. Shaking.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you two doing in there?\u201d she demands.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Donnie asks.</p><p>Liar. Liar. But why bother saying it. No one believed me the first time. I keep moving. Away. I can\u2019t see. I try to blink the school into focus, but I can\u2019t. I try not to panic. I don\u2019t need to see to get out of here. I press my hand against the wall and feel my way down the empty hall. I swallow air until I\u2019m so full of it, I think I\u2019ll explode.</p><p>I\u2019ll explode and I\u2019ll be over and I\u2019ll be done and that will be okay.</p><p>I stop and try to guess where I\u2019m supposed to be. I must have a class, but I don\u2019t know what period it is. The bell rings. I find myself elbowed and shouldered down the hall with the type of zeal only reserved for the end of the day. It\u2019s the end of the day.</p><p>Good. God.</p><p>I edge my way out of the herd, into a free space.</p><p>Right behind Kara.</p><p>Who is giggling with Jeanette.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>The words fall off my lips, stunned and stupid sounding, but so true. I\u2019ll kill her. At some point, I will kill her. All of this has to be leading up to a moment where I wrap my hands around her neck and squeeze.</p><p>She registers me slowly. \u201cHow did you get out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>I want it to sound strong coming out of my mouth. I want her to know it\u2019s true; she\u2019s dead. But Kara only stares and Jeanette stares and I feel like I\u2019m going to throw up again, so I force myself back into the elbows and shoulders and hope they push me out of here, because I have to get out of here.</p><p>An arm yanks me back.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck let you out? Where\u2019s Henderson?\u201d</p><p>Bruce. I jerk my arm from his grasp and shove him, but his solid frame doesn\u2019t budge. He just stares at me, amused, which makes me even angrier. Josh stands beside him, and I know I could shove him and he\u2019d feel it, so I do. I press my palms into his chest and push the fuck out of my ex-boyfriend. He staggers back.</p><p>Bruce grabs me again. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, Afton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off me.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cApologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck off me!\u201d</p><p>I shout it loudly enough for everyone to stop what they\u2019re doing and look, but no one does anything because it\u2019s only me and\u2013 Everyone. Hates. Me. Bruce doesn\u2019t let me go. I start pushing at him, these small stupid sounds coming out of my mouth, but no words. I\u2019m going to cry and I need to leave before that happens.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Bruce drops my hand and focuses on someone behind me. Michael. I rub my wrist and start moving away because I don\u2019t want him to see me. I don\u2019t want to see him.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Bruce asks.</p><p>Michael ignores him. \u201cRegina, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I never answer. I\u2019m already past rows and rows of orange lockers, past familiar blond curls and a flash of red, until the front doors are in sight, and I think I hear my name again but it\u2019s behind me and I am never going back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I go home and no one\u2019s there .</p><p>I suffocate on no one being there. I can still feel Donnie\u2019s hands on me. I get vodka from my dad\u2019s liquor cabinet, because the lock doesn\u2019t mean anything if you really want it, and I want it, I want to drink until I can breathe, but it doesn\u2019t really work, so I go to Michael\u2019s house because it\u2019s after school and he should be there and I don\u2019t want to be alone.</p><p>I leave with the bottle half empty, and it\u2019s empty when I get to his place, and no one\u2019s there either, and I\u2019m so wasted, I don\u2019t think I can actually walk back home. The last time I got this drunk, I was at one of Josh\u2019s parties. All of Josh\u2019s parties. The night would always end with Anna holding my hair while I puked, and I liked it because after what happened with Liz, it was the only time Anna felt like she was my best friend.</p> <p>I sneak down the narrow path to the backyard. I curl up on the chaise lounge by the pool and stare up at the sky, and the sky looks so stupid from here.</p><p>\u201c-been out here?\u201d</p><p>This moment started without me. I can\u2019t feel my fingers. I\u2019m static. I blink. I\u2019m still outside, sitting upright on the chaise lounge. I don\u2019t remember sitting up. Michael\u2019s in front of me, hands on my shoulders. \u201cRegina, how long have you been out here?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know. Thinking it isn\u2019t the same as saying it, though, and I don\u2019t have the energy to speak. I close my eyes and push him away. He presses his palm to my cheek, and his hand is so warm, I shiver.</p><p>\u201cCold,\u201d he says.</p> <p>And then another voice. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d</p><p>Not that voice. I open my eyes. I force myself to my feet and manage three unsteady steps away from both of them before I fall off the face of the planet. Michael\u2019s there, his arm around my waist. I stare up at him. \u201cYou told her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me she found you,\u201d he says, like that\u2019s a reason. It\u2019s not. I push away from him, but he holds fast until I push at him again. He eases me back down on the chaise. I bury my face in my hands because I don\u2019t want Liz to see me like this, even though it\u2019s already too late. I can feel her looking at me.</p><p>\u201cI bet you love this,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Anna,\u201d she says.</p><p>Ouch. I can\u2019t believe how bad hearing that feels. And then I have this thought: We probably could\u2019ve been friends, all three of us\u2014 like, real friends. I hate that thought.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say stupidly, and then sorry is on a loop. I can\u2019t keep it from coming out of my mouth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Liz, I\u2019m sorry\u2014Michael\u2014 I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Michael says quickly. \u201cRegina, it\u2019s okay\u2014\u201d</p><p>I laugh. It\u2019s the least funny thing in the world, but I laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019ll never...\u201d</p><p>My stomach twists, awful, and I cover my mouth with my hand and lean forward, and there\u2019s this horrible moment where I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to puke, but it doesn\u2019t happen. But I\u2019m really tired. I try to curl back into the chair, to sleep, but Michael pulls me forward. \u201cHey, no, Regina, don\u2019t do that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get her inside,\u201d Liz says.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He hooks my arm around his shoulder and gets me to my feet. I\u2019m still mad at him about her, though, so I try to push him away again, but it doesn\u2019t work again. He guides me toward the house, and my feet struggle with straight lines. It\u2019s not a fun kind of drunk. He swears under his breath while Liz waits for us at the door.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you\u2014?\u201d He stops, and redirects me for the umpteenth time. I lean into him more than I want to. \u201cNever mind. Forget I asked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was alone,\u201d I say, like that\u2019s a reason.</p><p>He gives me this look I can\u2019t decode, like sad but something else. He tightens his grip on me and gets me through the door, telling me when to step up, be careful. We bypass his kitchen\u2014I want to look, but only glimpse it\u2014and head for the living room. He pours me onto the couch while Liz hovers behind.</p><p>She could\u2019ve left by now. Should have.</p><p>Some small part of her has to love this.</p><p>\u201cGet her some water,\u201d she tells Michael. \u201cGet the phone, too. She\u2019s probably not going anywhere tonight....Get her to leave a message on her answering machine for her parents while she can still sort of fake sober.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s an Anna trick. We taught her that.</p><p>\u201cGood thinking,\u201d Michael says. He leaves. He leaves the room. He leaves me in the room alone with Liz. We stare at each other. I wish I could pass out so I could wake up so this nightmare would be over. Except it\u2019s never really over.</p><p>\u201cYour shirt\u2019s torn. A little,\u201d Liz says after a minute. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to say anything in front of Michael. He already freaked when I told him how I found you.\u201d She pauses and she looks concerned, like she wants to know\u2014make sure I\u2019m okay. But then she says, \u201cI\u2019m not going to ask you about it.\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cYou had perfect timing, Liz....\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she finally replies, and she sounds like she means it, and it makes me feel so bad. A tear manages to escape me. I wipe it away quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you forgive me?\u201d I blurt out. \u201cI got what I deserved. I know I deserve it, everything, but I need to know if you forgive\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike if you suffer enough I should forgive you?\u201d she asks, totally unimpressed. I exhale shakily and stare at her feet. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I really, really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Regina, you\u2019re really drunk right now,\u201d she says, which is like Shut up. So I shut up and we wait for Michael to come back. I take in the room. It\u2019s tidy but empty. The walls are bare and white, waiting for color. The furniture is sparse\u2014a couch, a chair in the corner, a television. It\u2019s like they never finished moving in. Like they started unpacking and stopped halfway and threw all the half-full boxes out.</p><p>Michael comes back with the water and the phone. Liz gives him my number. I can\u2019t believe she still remembers it. He dials and holds the receiver up to my ear. I wait for the answering machine to pick up, and then I mumble something about being\u201d...at Anna\u2019s for the night see you tomorrow love you bye.\u201d</p><p>I feel like such a loser.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Liz says because there\u2019s nothing else here for her to see. She touches Michael\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says.</p><p>Liz turns to me, and for a second I think she\u2019s going to say something, but she doesn\u2019t. She leaves. After a minute, the sound of the front door closing echoes through the house. I want to die.</p><p>Michael holds up the glass of water. He kneels down and presses it into my hands, and it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t hold it; it\u2019s that I don\u2019t want to. He anticipates this, cradling the glass in his palm. He sets it on the floor and looks at me.</p><p>\u201cDo you forgive me?\u201d I ask. Because Liz is right: I\u2019m really drunk right now, so this is the only time I\u2019ll get away with just asking him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d But he heard me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cLiz doesn\u2019t forgive me and you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he can say anything\u2014before I can even finish what I\u2019m saying\u2014I bring my hands to his face and clumsily lean forward. My lips graze his cheek, and he brings his hands to my side, to steady me or to keep me from touching him, I don\u2019t know. I bring my mouth to his lips and kiss him because...because his lips are nice.</p><p>And I\u2019m starved for nice things.</p><p>He kisses me back.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d He pulls away and his hand hits the water. It tips, spilling onto the carpet, and some kind of dull embarrassment plants itself in the middle of my brain so I\u2019ll feel stupid about this when I sober up. I reach for him, fumble with the buttons of his shirt, and I almost get one undone when he says that dumb word again: \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I bring my hands to his face again. I can touch him into this. But he grabs my hands and says, \u201cRegina,\u201d and that stops me for the last time.</p><p>And then he lets go of my hands.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel well,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cGo to sleep. You\u2019ll feel better when you wake up.\u201d Right.</p><p>The house is quiet.</p><p>The scene in the closet with Donnie drifts in and out of my head. I let it in and then I force it back out. Repeat.</p><p>Rays of sunlight filter in through the minute gaps in the curtain drawn over the glass door leading to the pool. I push them aside and stare at the water. It\u2019s still. It\u2019s late morning and Michael\u2019s not home or he\u2019s still sleeping. I\u2019m not sure and I don\u2019t want to find out. I think the easiest way to pretend Monday never happened is to get as far away from it as possible.</p><p>I unlock the door and step outside. It\u2019s cold. I can\u2019t believe we were choking on heat not that long ago and now it\u2019s cold out. I make my way around the house, down that stupid little path, and end up on the front lawn and\u2014</p><p>Michael\u2019s there, getting out of his car. He stops when he sees me, stays by the driver\u2019s side, like he\u2019s not sure how to proceed. My face gets hot. This moment where we cross paths the day after I sloppy-drunk-kiss him isn\u2019t supposed to happen.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says. \u201cHungover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s impressed. \u201cLucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I get a break.\u201d</p><p>He stays where he is and I stay where I am. It\u2019s a weird sort of face-off. I\u2019m not hungover, but I feel fragmented; lost. Nobody wants me.</p><p>\u201cI was alone, right?\u201d I finally ask, pointing back to the house. \u201cWhere\u2019s your dad? Did he...?\u201d</p><p>Michael hesitates. \u201cHe works. But he was here. He comes home through the front door, refuels in the kitchen, goes to bed, wakes up, refuels in kitchen, and leaves through the front door. He didn\u2019t even know you were here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014don\u2019t,\u201d he says, and then he turns red. \u201cI mean, I want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in the passenger side of Michael\u2019s car, watching Hallowed fly past, a picture of midmorning quiet. It\u2019s overcast and cold, and the sun barely kisses the houses lining the streets. After a while, Hallowell disappears and we pull onto a dirt road that leads out of town. I watch, as the wheels kick up dust in the rearview.</p> <p>Michael is a quiet comfort beside me. I like him beside me. After thirty minutes or so, the road goes smooth and then rough again. Another dirt road. We stay on this one a long time, until a familiar black convertible comes into view.</p><p>My chest tightens and my hand goes for the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Michael says quickly. \u201cRegina, he\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the convertible parked on the side of the road. Donnie\u2019s not here. It sinks in slowly. What that means. Donnie\u2019s not here. But his car is.</p><p>And then I feel like I\u2019ve chased a bunch of speed with twenty cups of coffee.</p> <p>Michael eases the Saturn to a stop behind the convertible.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll never find it out here.\u201d He pulls a different set of keys from his pockets. I recognize the little Swiss Army knife keychain. \u201cLeft them in the ignition. Idiot.\u201d He tosses them from hand to hand. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to give him a ride anywhere. He\u2019ll have to hoof it for who knows how long. So I was thinking we put the top down, because it\u2019s supposed to rain all week, and leave the keys inside for anyone to find....\u201d</p><p>Michael hands me the keys. I close my fingers around them. They\u2019re warm from his grasp and now they\u2019re in mine. Donnie loves that convertible.</p><p>It\u2019s the only thing he has.</p><p>I get out of the car and approach it carefully, slowly. I don\u2019t even know where to start, so I get into the driver\u2019s side, where Donnie sits every day, and think. And then I put the top down and shove the keys in the ignition. I feel empty. It\u2019s not enough.</p><p>And then I get an idea.</p> <p>The coffee-and-speed feeling comes back more intensely than before. I grab the keys again. This is perfect. I get out of the car. So perfect. I fingernail the knife out of the cover. I\u2019m vaguely aware of Michael watching as I drag the tip of the knife down the driver\u2019s side of the convertible. I press in hard. It\u2019s a beautiful sound.</p><p>It\u2019s a beautiful scratch.</p><p>And then I do it again.</p><p>Again. Again.</p><p>I step back and admire my handiwork. Four perfect scratches down the length of his classic convertible, but it still isn\u2019t enough. I could do better.</p><p>I need to stop looking at it like a car and more like a canvas.</p><p>I drop to my knees. My fingers are wrapped so tightly around the keys they hurt, but it\u2019s a good hurt. I move to the farthest side of the car and start making art\u2014a big letter D. I follow it with an O. U . I carve deep, going over the letters as hard as I can. C. H. E . It takes a while. My fingers go numb. I stop at the E and uncurl my fingers. I rub them and wait for the feeling to return. That takes a while, too.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Michael says, coming up behind me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not done,\u201d I say, and then I get to work on the B. The letters cross over the original lines I made and this is definitely art. This feels good. I imagine the car is Kara and I imagine the car is Anna. I imagine the metal as their skin, and it feels even better. That\u2019s sick. Even I know how sick that is.</p><p>It\u2019s as sick as locking me in a closet with the guy who tried to rape me.</p><p>I drop the knife.</p><p>For a minute, all I see is us. Me and Anna. Kara and Jeanette and Mara. No Josh, no Donnie, no Michael. Nothing is complicated. We are the sweet side of thirteen, traipsing down the main street, and we\u2019re eating out for lunch, the first time off campus. It\u2019s a Big Deal. We have to get permission slips and everything. I see Marta and Jeanette, and they\u2019re oblivious, happy. Kara is overweight, dour even when she smiles, and we\u2019re not close but we\u2019re not there\u2014here\u2014yet. And Anna is this carefree vision that makes my heart ache, because I don\u2019t know what happened to her, but she used to be good.</p><p>We\u2019re sick. We\u2019re sick. We\u2019re sick girls.</p><p>Michael kneels down beside me. \u201cA,\u201d he says.</p><p>I get back to work: A .</p><p>G.</p><p>Done. I\u2019m drenched in sweat and my bangs are stuck to my forehead. I take a deep breath and press my hands against the ground and just ride it out, and when I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not going to cry, I lean back and stare at the car, and I can feel how close Michael is beside me.</p><p>\u201cYou did this for me,\u201d I say slowly. \u201cBut we\u2019re not friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegina,\u201d he says, \u201cI...\u201d But he never finishes.</p><p>I stare at the ground and all I can think about is Michael\u2019s mouth against my mouth and Donnie\u2019s keys in my hands and how funny they felt against my palm, like a metal revelation.</p><p>It\u2019s like the evolution of anger. It doesn\u2019t have to be loud all the time .</p><p>Now it\u2019s just quiet and it\u2019s all of me.</p><p>I cross the school parking lot and feel like a junkie looking for a fix, but I\u2019m not sure what my next fix is. I just know it\u2019s in this building. I pull the front doors open and step into three-quarters of my old crowd. Anna, Kara, and Jeanette stare at me like they can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve done it, and now that I\u2019ve done it, I can\u2019t believe it either. And then I just stand there, paralyzed. I can\u2019t move. Something is going to happen.</p><p>I\u2019m just not sure what.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Regina, just go\u201d</p><p>I study each and every one of them, committing their faces to memory. I know what they look like, but I want to make sure I remember them this way, post-locking me in a closet with Donnie. My fingers curl. in on themselves, and I bite my tongue so hard, I taste blood. I hate these girls I hate these girls I hate these girls.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking deaf?\u201d Kara.</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d Anna says impatiently. \u201cMarta can find us at my locker.\u201d</p><p>She moves out and Jeanette follows after her, but Kara stays behind to smirk. All I\u2019d have to do is reach out and choke, she\u2019s that close. It\u2019d be so easy and it would feel so good. But I can\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cKara.\u201d Anna. Her Here, girl, voice. I remember that voice.</p><p>Kara gives me one last look and hurries after Anna. She\u2019s fucked if she thinks I\u2019m done with her. I take a sharp breath in, and my body comes back to me; I can move, but now I have to wait. I lean against the wall and watch people filter in until the bell rings. When it finally does, I head up the stairs and down the hall to her locker, and she\u2019s there.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t see me coming until I\u2019m shoving her against the locker. She makes a startled noise, but she rallies quickly and shoves me back, and I shove her again and it\u2019s my palms on her shoulders. This beautiful adrenaline rush. I will kill her.</p><p>She sees it in me and manages to slip away before I can do it.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to chase her. Not yet.</p><p>The hall is empty. Class noises ghost in. I lean against Kara\u2019s locker and come down, but I don\u2019t want to come down. Someone shuffles my way. I turn. Donnie. He looks like shit. There are bags under his eyes and his hair is greasy. It\u2019s weird that we\u2019re living in two separate but similar hells. That Anna has found a way to make him miserable and I\u2019m not a part of it.</p><p>I really would have liked to have been a part of it.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your car?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He stops and looks at me, confused. Not confused about what I\u2019ve asked him, but that I\u2019ve asked him and that I\u2019m not scared. I like the way it feels.</p><p>\u201cNone of your fucking business,\u201d he mutters. And then, \u201cIt\u2019s getting work done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>I steel myself. I watch him process it, watch the color of his face start building to a good red.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to my car?\u201d he growls.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Donnie,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019ll turn up. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>He comes close, so close. At-the-party close. My heart beats crazy in my chest, but I know none of it is on my face, so I just keep going. \u201cWhat? It still runs.\u201d</p><p>He brings his fist up and slams his knuckles into the metal beside my head.</p><p>\u201cTell me where it is or you\u2019re dead, Afton.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s breathing heavily. He wants to hurt me, but I\u2019m not entirely convinced that he will. We stare at each other, our eyes locked, and I raise my chin.</p><p>Do something.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d We turn, startled by this new voice. Brenner stands in the middle of the hall, his arms crossed. Donnie backs off. \u201cGet to class, both of you.\u201d</p><p>Donnie goes one way and I go the other. That was stupid. That was stupid. That was stupid. That was really, really stupid. But I\u2019d do it again in a second, just to have that moment that felt like it was mine.</p><p>I walk down the hall. All I can think about is what\u2019s next, the next moment that\u2019s mine. I\u2019m not going to class. I\u2019m not going to find it in class. I wander the halls seeking it out until the adrenaline fades, and the bell rings again.</p><p>It\u2019s strange walking with these bodies, all on their way to class. This is their day-to-day. Nothing bothers them, and the things that might bother them are nothing. I roll my shoulders, I flex my fingers. There\u2019s something inside me that needs somewhere to go. I feel quiet-reckless-crazy. I feel like ...I could shove my knuckles into metal and it would never hurt. I feel dead inside.</p><p>I round the corner and spot Michael at the end of the hall talking to Liz. I stop. My heart stops. I duck into the spaces between rows of lockers because I\u2019m avoiding him. After the closet with Donnie, the kiss, the car, I see him and I can\u2019t breathe. I\u2019m scared of what I felt both times\u2014when my mouth was on his mouth and after he put his hands on my wrists and told me no.</p><p>I peek around the corner and watch him talk to Liz. I want to see what that looks like\u2014if there\u2019s something there when he talks to her that isn\u2019t there when he talks to me. It\u2019s effortless. They aren\u2019t into each other like that, but he\u2019s leaning against the locker and she\u2019s close the way friends are close. She says something to him and he says something back and smiles and laughs. I\u2019m struck by how amazing it is and how sad that makes me, because I\u2019ve never seen that. He\u2019s not like that around me. The way his mouth quirks and lights up his eyes. He should smile more often. It\u2019s so innocent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lean back against the wall and chew on my lips, swallowing hard. It hurts being on the outside of something so honest. I want it, but I don\u2019t know how I can have it when I\u2019m so angry, and I feel so far from finished.</p><p>I spend lunch in my storage room .</p><p>I\u2019m sitting on the floor, picking at my fingernails, waiting for the bell to ring. Legs crossed at the ankle. This is boring, but it\u2019s okay because nothing is happening, and I\u2019m trying not to think too much, because I think too much and I never think good things. I count the number of mats wedged at the back of the room (four). I find various pieces of broken equipment in a cobwebby cardboard box wedged in the corner and organize them into piles and then put them back.</p> <p>When the bell rings, I press my ear against the door and wait until all the footsteps fade away, and then I sneak out and drift down the hall.</p><p>\u201cHey, Regina\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stiffen. That\u2019s Michael\u2019s voice. He\u2019s somewhere behind me. I duck my shoulders and quicken my pace. He\u2019ll get the message; he\u2019s not stupid.</p><p>\u201cRegina\u2014\u201d</p><p>His voice gets lost to hall noises, and I relax because that has to mean he\u2019s fallen behind. I don\u2019t know what he could possibly want with me. We\u2019ve come to a natural end. There can\u2019t be much left after you steal a car for someone and then stand around and watch while they decimate the paint job.</p> <p>I slam shoulders with some freshman and slip around them, narrowly missing someone else. The hall is congested. I push past a few more stationary bodies because my locker\u2019s here, and then I...</p><p>...feel it in my bones before my brain processes it.</p><p>Everything goes cold.</p><p>My red locker door is hanging open, guts splayed out for the whole world to see. The hall is congested because people are pausing so they can point at it and laugh. They make ridiculous faces as they go. I edge wordlessly through the crowd so I can get a good look at what they\u2019ve done to my locker this time this time this time again.</p><p>Rancid, raw ground meat. All over everything. My books. My coat. Book bag. The sides of my locker. Everywhere. Everything is ruined. They must have raided the grocery store and bought up all the bargain meat and left it outside for days and days, because the smell is unbelievable. Acrid, sour.</p><p>I reach in. My fingers brush over slimy bits of some dead animal.</p> <p>My heartbeat slows to nothing and then, when I\u2019m sure I\u2019m dead, it thumps once. Twice. Three times. Steady and even. I\u2019m still here. I get to ten beats and then it beats faster\u2014twenty, faster, thirty, faster, forty. Do something do something do something.</p><p>I slam the door so hard it recoils back.</p><p>The crowd murmurs.</p><p>\u201cRegina\u2014\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s voice sounds like it\u2019s far away, but it\u2019s closer than I want it to be. I storm down the hall, away from it. He calls me once more. Part of me wants to detach myself from this anger and go to him, but that part of me is very small. I head for the second floor. Kara\u2019s locker. She might be there. Because it was her. Maybe it was Anna\u2019s idea, but Kara would\u2019ve done it.</p><p>Anna would never touch that stuff.</p><p>I crash into some moron who\u2019s decided to go down the up stairs. Books fly. I grab the railing and push myself forward until I hear this: \u201cThanks a lot, bitch.\u201d</p><p>And even though she hasn\u2019t spoken to me in ages, I haven\u2019t forgotten that blonde\u2019s breathy voice yet. Jeanette bends down and gathers her books, muttering to herself. Seeing the back of her head gives me a prickly thrill in the pit of my stomach. One of her books has landed beyond her. I grab it. It\u2019d be a dangerous move if it were anyone but Jeanette, but I\u2019m better than her, even when I\u2019m not.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t catch sight of the book until I wave it in front of her face. Moron. She tries to snatch it out of my hands, but I back away and hold it out of her reach.</p><p>\u201cGive me my book!\u201d</p><p>The venom in her voice surprises me a little. I know she hates me, but I don\u2019t think I ever disliked Jeanette. I think I liked her. I didn\u2019t respect her, but I liked her.</p><p>\u201cWho put the meat in my locker?\u201d I demand. She gets uncomfortable all over, clutching her books like they\u2019re a security blanket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to talk to you.\u201d She\u2019s practically sweating. It\u2019s really pathetic. \u201cGive me my book back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me who put the meat in my locker and I\u2019ll give you your book and I\u2019ll leave you alone. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll stand here until Anna shows and sees you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce and Kara,\u201d she blabs. \u201cNow give me my book!\u201d</p><p>I keep it out of her reach, because I can and because it feels good. Jeanette stamps her foot, and I can\u2019t help but grin.</p><p>\u201d Give me my fucking book, Regina!\u201d</p><p>I let her rip it from my grasp and watch her storm her way down the up stairs, and then she stops at the bottom of them and turns to me, her face red.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally shaking, Jeanette.\u201d Wait. \u201cWait. Tell her\u2014tell her you were talking to me and tell Kara to watch her back, but make sure you tell them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s gone, she\u2019s done, but I\u2019m just getting started.</p><p>I jog down the steps, past my locker, down the hall. I can\u2019t make a Web site about Kara. I turn down another hallway. I already trashed her locker. Can\u2019t do that again. I make my way past people going wherever, and I try to block out their voices and the fact that they\u2019re pointing and laughing at me again. I can\u2019t make a Web site about Anna either. Too obvious. There\u2019s no one they\u2019d hate to be locked in a closet with. I turn down another hall, a deserted hall, a familiar hall. This is why I got drunk directly after what happened with Donnie. So I didn\u2019t have to feel it, but now I feel it, I feel all of it, and it\u2019s too much and I\u2014 Do something do something.</p><p>I push through the door to the storage room and slam it behind me because I don\u2019t care, and I grab the box of broken things and throw it against the wall. It explodes.</p><p>And then it\u2019s quiet.</p><p>I press my hand against my forehead. My head is throbbing. I\u2019m breathing like I ran a marathon, and my stomach is churning and my throat is tight and I\u2019m hot. I kick one of the old mats and then I kick it again, and then I bite my arm because I\u2019m going to scream; I\u2019m not going to scream and...okay.</p><p>It\u2019s okay.</p><p>My chest caves in, deflates; my heart is calm, my heart is pumping calm. No\u2014not calm. Nothing. I should go back. But I kneel down and press my hands against the cold floor and crawl until I\u2019m against the wall instead. I\u2019ll go home and talk to Mom and Dad about finishing out the year\u2014not at school. I can\u2019t do this anymore.</p><p>I bring my knees up and rest my head against them. I close my eyes. I run my hand over the floor, feeling grit and dust, and I have a problem.</p><p>Now that I\u2019m down, I don\u2019t want to get up. I guess I can stay here awhile.</p><p>I\u2019m just starting to get into that peaceful, falling kind of place be tween dozing and actual sleep when the door opens slowly, and some vague alarm goes off inside me\u2014 Oh no, you\u2019re caught \u2014but I don\u2019t care until the light from the hallway hits my eyelids and rudely jolts me into wakefulness, and then I do. I look up. Michael is standing in the doorway holding a black garbage bag. He flicks on the light and I wince.</p><p>\u201cThe stuff from your locker,\u201d he says, holding the bag up. He sets it inside the door, which he closes quietly behind him, and then he faces the room. I watch him take it all in. The mess I made. \u201c...Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d My tongue feels thick. \u201cI followed you,\u201d he says. \u201cI saw you come in here. I thought I\u2019d give you a minute so I cleaned out your locker. It\u2019s clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe they did that to you,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, I can, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He crosses the room and sits beside me, close. His shoulder against my shoulder. I tense and then I relax. It\u2019s not like he can reject me twice, because I\u2019m not going to make a move. I\u2019m not saying anything. A few minutes pass, and he clears his throat.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you do to Kara?\u201d</p><p>I look at him. He looks at me. I laugh a little, because even though it\u2019s not funny, it\u2019s not anything like what I thought he was going say.</p><p>\u201cUhm ...\u201d I bite my lower lip. \u201cKara couldn\u2019t keep up. So we\u2014I mean, I told her that a lot. It kind of fucked her up. A lot.\u201d</p><p>And the rest is history.</p><p>\u201cSo I guess I deserve this,\u201d I add absently.</p><p>And then my eyes catch sight of the garbage bag against the wall with all of my ruined things inside of it, and my face dissolves. Don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t cry . It shouldn\u2019t matter at this point. Michael\u2019s seen me at my worst, but I press my hand against my eyes, taking short pathetic breaths in and out until I\u2019m choking on air, and all I want to do is tell him about how paralyzing it was in that closet with Donnie and how we weren\u2019t always like this and how sick it is, but all I can manage are these six, stilted words: \u201cI-just-want-them-to-stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take you home,\u201d he says. I shake my head and wipe my eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay here, Regina. Let me take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. I sound like a stubborn little kid. No. But I don\u2019t want to step into the halls again, because I\u2019m tired of being out there and this feels safe. He gets to his feet and holds his hand out, and I push him away. \u201cStop. Michael, stop it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember when I told you my mom wouldn\u2019t have hated you, even if she\u2019d known what you\u2019d done? She would\u2019ve tried to help you.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThat means something to me.\u201d I close my eyes and shake my head. \u201cPlease let me help you.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes. I take his hand. His fingers close around mine and he helps me to my feet. We end up close and it hurts, because I want to be this close to someone who wants to be this close to me. He doesn\u2019t want me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you,\u201d he says.</p><p>I look at him and I think he\u2019s telling the truth. Before, I could see it\u2014that he hated me. But now it\u2019s not there enough for me to see, if it\u2019s there at all, and that\u2019s the strangest feeling I\u2019ve had in a long time.</p> <p>\u201cRegina,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you.\u201d</p><p>He edges closer until there\u2019s no space between us and brings his hands to my face so awkwardly, like this isn\u2019t what he set out to do, but now that we\u2019re here, he\u2019s going to do it all the same. This is a test. This is not a test.</p><p>He kisses me. Presses his lips against mine gently, hesitantly, and when I kiss back, he kisses harder, deeper. I feel like he wants me. He brings his hand to my neck and kisses me and kisses me again. I bring my hands around to the back of his neck, his hair tickling past my knuckles, and his fingers drift down to my sides. For a minute, I\u2019m dizzy with how good it feels and how amazing it is that I could have this moment that feels so good.</p><p>He\u2019s so nice.</p><p>He brings his mouth to my neck. I shiver and close my eyes, my hands still in his hair. He stops for a second and we stand there, his lips just barely there, and he brings his hands up and gently pushes my collar back so there\u2019s more of me for him to kiss and my legs feel sort of weak. His mouth comes back to mine. I bring my hand to his chest.</p> <p>Steady.</p><p>The door flies open, puts a space between us so wide it\u2019s like we were never on each other at all. I\u2019m breathing heavily and he\u2019s breathing heavily. I squint at the figure in the door, waiting for my eyes to focus.</p><p>It\u2019s Bruce. He bursts out laughing as his stupid tiny brain registers what he\u2019s just seen and what it\u2019s seeing now, and I feel my face turn red.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d I tell him, crossing my arms. My head still feels fuzzy with the kiss. I shake it a little, to clear it. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He just smiles and he doesn\u2019t say anything, and I get this uneasy feeling that he knew\u2014he knew I was here all along. I glance at Michael, and I think he\u2019s thinking the same thing, because he clenches his jaw. Even Bruce notices. He backs off and laughs again and then he goes and he laughs himself down the hall.</p> <p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say. \u201cNow they\u2019ll know that we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Michael asks, turning to me. \u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>We stare at each other. So they know; so what? I wonder if, even after all this, he understands how fragile good things are in my hands and how many times they\u2019ve been taken away from me. I lean over and give him an impulsive kiss on the cheek, and then I leave the storage room and he leaves after me.</p><p>I wake up wired, and I go to school wired, popping antacids like they\u2019re</p><p>candy. It\u2019s been one day and I feel sick, excited, nervous.</p><p>It was almost easier when he hated me. I\u2019m used to that.</p><p>Hallowell High: Everyone\u2019s dressed for the weather.</p><p>Michael is waiting for me at my locker. The red door hangs open, a useless empty mouth, waiting to be filled with all I could salvage last night. He straightens when he sees me, and I try to ignore the funny feeling in my stomach, but when he smiles, it gets worse in a good way, and it goes straight to my head in a good way.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says, holding out his hand. His fingers are closed around something I can\u2019t see. \u201cI have something for you. Open your hand.\u201d</p><p>I do. He presses something heavy into it. I look down. A new combination lock.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThe combination is four, fifteen, thirty, and three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I repeat.</p><p>He moves forward, and then he hesitates and moves back. Whatever\u2019s between us is that kind of new. He runs a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll see you at lunch,\u201d he says. I nod.</p><p>He studies me for a good minute and then\u2014he kisses me. Like, right here in the hall. In front of everyone. I feel people milling around us, their voices getting louder the closer they get. Breaking news: My mouth is on Michael Hayden\u2019s mouth, and he means it.</p><p>I glimpse blond hair. Liz. She turns a corner going to the girls\u2019 room. Which means she saw this. Michael pulls away and says, \u201cOkay, good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLunch,\u201d I repeat. He nods this time and passes me. I watch him go, and then I turn and head for the washroom because I want to see what she makes of it. When I push through the door, she\u2019s coming out of the stall. She glances at me and then runs the water, keeping her eyes on her reflection, and I just stand there keeping my eyes on her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say, Regina?\u201d she finally asks. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving you my blessing,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d I don\u2019t know. She turns off the water and I turn back to the door, and she says, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when he hates me, he knows what he\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really fucked him up, so if\u2014\u201d She shakes her head, like this whole turn of events has been pissing her off since the dawn of time. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t get it, but if he\u2019s giving you a chance, that\u2019s a big deal.\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth. \u201cI get it.\u201d</p><p>I wish I\u2019d never come in here at all.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you do,\u201d she says, looking me up and down. I bite the inside of my cheek but I don\u2019t say anything. \u201cBut whatever, Regina; use him up.\u201d</p><p>Some people will never give up on their lack of belief in you. I\u2019m used to that feeling, but for the first time ever, it hurts. Maybe because Michael got past it, and now I\u2019m standing here wondering why she can\u2019t and if she ever will.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t talk him out of you.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t talk him out of you. Her voice echoes in my head from class to class, and my stomach aches. When the lunch bell rings, I\u2019m eager to see Michael. I pass Josh in the hall on my way to the cafeteria and keep my eyes straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cAre you and Hayden a thing now?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I roll my eyes and stop. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He stops. \u201cBruce said he caught you two fucking around in a storage room, and now everyone\u2019s talking about how you two were making out in the hall earlier. Is it true? Are you with Hayden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re making out with him in hallways, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s business.\u201d He looks me over and laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re not with Hayden. He hates you. Everyone knows he hates you. He feel sorry for you or something? Desperate to get some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be really desperate,\u201d he says. \u201cOr maybe you\u2019re the desperate one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s happened to me.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks warm instantly. It\u2019s one of those insanely stupid-sounding declarations that people laugh at you for, no matter how true it is. But it\u2019s true.</p><p>Josh laughs at me. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed a whole lot has changed for you since you decided to hang around with Mr. Mysterious\u2014\u201d I punch him in the shoulder before he can finish, because I can\u2019t think of a better or more satisfying way to shut him up. \u201c\u2014Jesus Christ, Regina! What is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You just stand there and watch every day while Anna makes my life a living hell. Who just sits there and watches something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d Josh snaps. \u201cYou always did. Her name was Liz, remember? Don\u2019t act like you\u2019re better than me, Regina. You\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Michael is,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Josh turns red. I know somehow I\u2019ve hurt him. \u201cWell, maybe your new boyfriend should watch his back.\u201d</p><p>My stomach lurches and he smirks, satisfied. The threat goes deep. I turn and head for the cafeteria, digging into my pockets for an antacid, trying to understand how I can be this close to fucking everything up already. When I see Michael at the Garbage Table, I\u2019m flooded with relief. He\u2019s in one piece.</p><p>And he\u2019s waiting for me.</p><p>I weave around tables and sit across from him. His lunch today\u2014 fries and Coke. His Moleskine rests beside him. I just watch him for a minute and I feel like Liz is right. He\u2019s really lonely and I fuck things up. Just because he gets to this point where he wants to kiss me doesn\u2019t mean I instantly wake up tomorrow brave. I\u2019m afraid of what Josh said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNothing.\u201d Everything.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t look like he believes me, but then, thankfully, embarrassingly, my stomach makes this awful hungry gurgle and he hears it. He raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I wave a hand. \u201cI\u2019ll eat when I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get you something,\u201d he says, nodding at the lunch line, and I start telling him how I can\u2019t eat in this place, and he interrupts. \u201cI\u2019ll get you something small.\u201d</p><p>Like that would make a difference. But he gets up and goes. I watch him go. My gaze drifts over to the center table, where Josh is leaning over and whispering something in Anna\u2019s ear. His mouth moves from her ear, grazing her cheek, and meets her lips; I don\u2019t want Michael on their radar.</p><p>I turn back to the table. Michael\u2019s trusty Moleskine is resting next to his tray.</p><p>I want to read it.</p><p>He\u2019s standing in line and he\u2019s not looking my way. I know I shouldn\u2019t do this, but I have to do this, and I don\u2019t have a lot of time to have an ethical debate about it right now. I grab it and flip it open, flip past page after page, searching for my name. I glimpse words like Mom, Dad, hate, yesterday, I, stupid school, and all of them mean something, but they\u2019re not what I want.</p><p>I skip to the end, and then\u2014</p><p>Might not last.</p><p>I know it\u2019s about me. It\u2019s dated yesterday. It says I\u2019m not a sure thing\u2014like I could really fuck this up. I press my index fingers against the words, as if I could feel what he was feeling when he wrote it, but it\u2019s just ink on paper. I flip ahead, but there\u2019s nothing. I set the Moleskine back where it was and wait for him to come back, and I guess there\u2019s some truth in it. I don\u2019t think I can divide myself so completely between him and Anna. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Someone will get hurt.</p><p>Maybe your new boyfriend should watch his back.</p><p>I look up at the center table. Anna is watching me, interested in a way that makes me sick. I spot Michael winding his way back to the table, a small container of yogurt in his hand, and I am overwhelmed with how much more I like him than I hate my ex-friends.</p> <p>But I don\u2019t know what to do about it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m that brave.</p><p>Do something.</p><p>After school, I end up at the park.</p><p>Small-town entertainment. Kid explosion in the summer. Everyone vies for a shot at the swings and the monkey bars and the playhouse and the slides and the metal merry-go-round thing that some little girl supposedly severed a limb on years ago. Today the place is empty, save for the snack wagon, which doesn\u2019t pack up until the first snow flies. I buy some greasy fries from the guy holding the place down, drown them in ketchup, and eat them on top of the monkey bars.</p><p>A light breeze pushes the swings back and forth. I finish off the fries and try to enjoy the quiet. It\u2019s easy to be out here: I\u2019m not surrounded.</p> <p>After a long time, two separate cars pull into the parking lot. No one I recognize. Two soccer moms step out of each car, dragging two little girls with them, respectively. Must be a play date.</p><p>They stay to the far side of the park, away from the big toys. I watch them and feel a sense of relief when I see the girls don\u2019t have much interest in each other. They pick separate spaces of grass and focus on the dolls they\u2019ve brought with them while their moms talk. I hope they stay away from each other, because odds are good one of them has the making of a total bitch and the other will become that bitch\u2019s total bitch.</p><p>Because that\u2019s how it works. Mostly.</p><p>I lean back, hooking my legs over the bars and snaking through the spaces between them until I\u2019m hanging upside down.</p><p>\u201cMommy, look at that!\u201d One of the girls shrieks. \u201cI want to do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s dangerous honey,\u201d her mom says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go play with Casey? You two can play dolls with each other....\u201d That\u2019s dangerous.</p> <p>I stay upside down until I feel like my head is going to burst and I ease back up. I lie across the bars and bundle my coat under my head like a pillow. After an hour or so, the women leave with their daughters. The temperature drops and the light shifts.</p><p>I stare at the sky and wait for it to come to me.</p><p>Truce.</p><p>Truce.</p><p>I wake up and that word is in my head.</p><p>This morning\u2013a pale pink antacid with coffee. Truce. Dad goes through the whole paper, and I\u2019m still debating it. He leaves. Mom is running late, looking for her car keys. I feel guilty watching her. She just wants to be a good mother, and it\u2019s weird and sad to me how we\u2019re all in some small ways trying to be good.</p><p>\u201cI broke up with Josh,\u201d I tell her. I don\u2019t know why. \u201cA while ago.\u201d</p><p>Her head snaps up, eyes wide and surprised, and then they glaze over like she finally understands everything that\u2019s been going on. She takes this one little piece of the puzzle and puts it into the wrong picture.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Regina,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d I shrug. \u201cHe was useless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sometimes are,\u201d she says, amused.</p><p>She gives me a kiss on the cheek and leaves. I sit at the table for as long as I can stretch it out and then I grab my book bag and walk to school.</p><p>Truce.</p><p>I\u2019m not stupid. I know it\u2019s dumb and impossible, but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. It\u2019s dumb and impossible but it\u2019s also grown-up and brave. Not the easy thing to do. And maybe Anna will see that and she\u2019ll be so shocked and amazed that I asked her\u2014no one\u2019s asked for a truce before\u2014that she\u2019ll let me have it, and then I\u2019ll tell Michael and it will get back to Liz, and Liz will be impressed, and we all untie ourselves from this Regina, and then I get to be the one that\u2019s happy and braver and like...Better.</p><p>Time passes too quickly when you\u2019re getting ready to do something you</p><p>don\u2019t want to do. The morning and afternoon disappear, and I keep trying to figure out how I\u2019m going to do this, but you can\u2019t really plan anything when you deal with Anna.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Michael asks me at lunch. I\u2019m jiggling my knee under the table like a spaz, and my palms are slimy with sweat.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I tell him. I want it to be a surprise. \u201cI\u2019m just...\u201d I trail off and offer him a feeble smile. \u201cMonday.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all I need to say.</p><p>I skip out on my last class and wait for Anna at her Benz. I swallow a couple antacids. I keep wiping my hands on my jeans. Every time I inhale, my whole chest tingles, and by the time the last bell rings, I can\u2019t breathe. I can do this. I tense and watch students shove each other out the front door\u2014I duck out of sight as Michael gets into his Saturn and drives away\u2014until, eventually, they emerge\u2014 the four of them together.</p><p>I can almost see myself wedged between Anna and Kara. Kara always kept her distance, slightly removed, because I told her to. I watch Marta and Jeanette break off for Jeanette\u2019s car. For a second, I think if I could do it all over again, I\u2019d want to be one of those two, because they don\u2019t matter. But I\u2019d never do it all over again.</p><p>Kara points me out to Anna. Anna gives me the dirtiest look when they reach her Benz. I straighten. My ringers curl and a familiar hot feeling spreads through me. I try to bury it. I need to be beyond that. Now.</p><p>\u201cGet,\u201d Anna says, pointing across the parking lot, \u201caway from my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to\u2014\u201d It comes out sounding like there are hands around my throat. I cough and try again. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d Anna crinkles her nose. \u201cHow about...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Kara suggests.</p><p>Anna shoves me out of the way and pulls her keys from her purse.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you about\u2014\u201d Kara rounds the car, rolling her eyes, and I just blurt the words out: \u201cI want you to leave me alone.\u201d Anna and Kara exchange a glance and laugh. \u201cI mean a truce,\u201d I blurt out.</p><p>They freeze. Anna\u2019s eyes travel from the keys to her hand to the car to Kara, who leans over the hood, shocked. The moment passes quickly. Anna snorts and unlocks her door. She opens it. Kara stays where she is, but I\u2019m not appealing to Kara.</p><p>I grab Anna\u2019s door and block her path.</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Regina.\u201d</p><p>This is the closest I\u2019ve been to her since I slapped her, and she looks as angry as she did then. My heart gets all tangled up in my stomach, and my mouth is a desert. I scrape my tongue along my lips.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to be friends with you,\u201d Kara says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you for your friendship, you idiot. I\u2019m asking you for a truce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kara says, at the same time Anna says, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>At least the suggestion is unprecedented enough to capture Anna\u2019s attention, like I thought it might be. I doubt it will be enough to capture her heart. Especially with Kara standing right there. I wish I could push Kara out of this picture and off a cliff.</p><p>\u201cI want you off my back,\u201d I say. \u201cWhy else do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kara says. \u201cWe\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Anna holds her hand up, silencing Kara. She inclines her head for me to continue.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re graduating soon,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m tired of this. Truce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were really tired of this, you wouldn\u2019t keep pushing back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d I demand. Neither of them says what they\u2019re thinking. \u201cOh, so I\u2019m just supposed to stand there and let you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. After what you did to me,\u201d Anna says, \u201cyes.\u201d</p><p>Anna will never believe what really happened with Donnie. And now I\u2019m the one who has to give. I\u2019m conceding to the girls who locked me in a closet with a guy who tried to rape me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think this out. I don\u2019t think I can do this.</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d I raise my hands. \u201cJust\u2014forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Anna says. She sizes me up. \u201cIf you want a truce, I want something for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her eyes widen. Anna has never heard me say the word to her before. I\u2019ve never seen her consider a truce, though, either, so I don\u2019t want to shoot myself in the foot. I eye her warily. \u201cWhat do you want, Anna?\u201d</p><p>The question stumps her. There\u2019s nothing I have that she wants. I get a glimmer of hope in the pit of my gut. If she doesn\u2019t think of anything, I could walk away from this intact.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me,\u201d Kara says. \u201cAnna, give it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Kara,\u201d I say.</p><p>Anna\u2019s eyes light up, and I hate myself for giving that away. She never takes her eyes off me as she tells Kara, \u201cOkay, K. I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d</p><p>Kara doesn\u2019t even try to build to it, doesn\u2019t want to torture me or list a slew of horrible, degrading things she could force me to do in the name of a truce. Instead, she leans across the car eagerly and says, \u201cApologize.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s trembling, she wants it so bad. I guess I can give it to her. For Michael. I open my mouth and wait for the words to come\u2014 they don\u2019t mean anything\u2014but they stay stuck inside, like being stuck in a closet with Donnie Henderson, like me being stuck in a room with Donnie Henderson. It wouldn\u2019t be so hard to hide the bruises.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are my terms.\u201d</p><p>My mouth moves, but nothing comes out. I want to hurt her. I want to hurt her for having the balls to ask. Kara smiles and says, \u201cFine. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re only words. I\u2019ll just say them even though she locked me in a fucking closet with Donnie Henderson. Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t freak out. Let her have this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u201d\u2014 not sorry \u2014\u201cI\u2014Kara\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I think of all those notes that are still on my desk and try to inspire the same guilt that came over me when I saw the one from Liz, but it\u2019s impossible.

I can\u2019t let her have this.</p><p>\u201cThis is fascinating,\u201d Anna says dryly. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to go home now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucking hate you Kara.\u201d It explodes from my mouth, and now I\u2019m the one trembling, because that\u2019s how bad I want to tell her. \u201cYou\u2019re pathetic, you\u2019ve always been pathetic, and everything I said to you came out of Anna\u2019s mouth first.

Anyway, see you tomorrow, Regina.\u201d</p><p>She gets in the car and burns rubber out of the parking lot.</p> <p>teenylinks.com/28ccyz</p><p>\u2014K</p><p>I stare at the e-mail for a half hour, trying to figure out what to do. Kara\u2019s fed the original link into a URL alias site. If I click it, it could send me anywhere. And since the link is from Kara, I know I won\u2019t walk away from whatever it leads to unscathed. A computer virus, maybe. Skeevy porn or worse\u2014it\u2019s total bait.</p><p>I have to take it. I back up the computer first. That takes longer than I want it to. The e-mail sits in my inbox the whole time, waiting to be read.</p><p>I click the link.</p><p>When it takes me to the IH8RA page, I feel a sense of relief. I\u2019ve seen this stupid page. I almost forget it was there.

I search for some kind of indication of what I can expect, because I\u2019m too afraid to click the links. I\u2019ll have to, though. If most of the school knows what\u2019s behind them, I have to, so when I walk through the doors tomorrow\u2014</p><p>I\u2019ll know.</p><p>One comment steals all the air from my lungs.</p><p>I hope she fucking dies.</p><p>It\u2019s from some freshman I don\u2019t really know named Katie Lang-den.</p><p>Someone I don\u2019t really know wants me to die.</p><p>I scroll up the page and start with the photos. Every embarrassing moment Anna managed to capture on camera is on display. I try to make peace with the fact that at least half of the school has now seen me at my worst. It\u2019s okay. Everyone at school has been the person who passed out next to the toilet; they just didn\u2019t have Anna hovering over them with a Nikon when they were. Bad hair days. Bad fashion choices. This is ugliness, but it\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s\u2014totally mortifying.</p><p>I click away.</p><p>Things You Didn\u2019t Know...</p><p>Click. I stare at my handwriting. My notes. All scanned in. A gallery. Anna\u2019s ammunition. I couldn\u2019t get them all. I tried. I\u2019d always try to end our notes on stupid, innocuous questions, something she had to answer and send back so I could have them, but sometimes I was careless....</p><p>I scroll through them, numb. I\u2019d forgotten the time we tore apart all the girls in our English class. Names down one side, physical flaws down the other. It was a group effort, but I was secretary, so now it gets pinned on me. All the fat thighs, big asses, crater faces, lisps. These girls are still at school, and I have to face them tomorrow.</p><p>Guys I\u2019d never sleep with and why. The companion list, also in my handwriting. Written on a boring, sweltering hot day in math class. Ernie Sanders heads it up. Quiet and shy, future astronaut, he tutored me in tenth grade, and my handwriting reduces him to the size\u2014or lack of size\u2014of his penis. I called Carter Anders a Cro-Mag.</p><p>I thought it was fun at the time.</p><p>Some notes are one-sided conversations, little commentaries on people I didn\u2019t know enough to like. No one who looks at the scanned pieces of paper will notice the way they\u2019re ripped. Anna\u2019s replies, which were always usually more scathing, are hacked off the bottom.</p><p>And that\u2019s not all: My secrets are there. Precious thoughts I committed to paper and trusted her with because I was stupid. Worrying about my first time. Whether or not it would hurt. How useless I think my parents are. Why I like it in the dark.</p><p>I wrote it all down.</p><p>I stop breathing. My head pounds. The screen starts to gray out. I didn\u2019t actually think you could get so mad you could lose the room, but here I am, gripping the edge of my desk and trying to bring myself back enough so that I can click the Report Abuse link and then\u2014</p><p>Fuck a truce. Fuck it.</p><p>Revenge comes into my head fully formed, so simple and so perfect I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of it before. Anna always said to stay above the hate. She\u2019s obsessive about it, because she knows everyone hates her. Don\u2019t let them know you know. Don\u2019t let them see it on your face. Don\u2019t be weak. Never let them know your weaknesses.</p><p>But I\u2019ve always known her weaknesses.</p><p>I haven\u2019t even cooled by the time I\u2019ve created the fake e-mail and the fake YourSpace account. So easy. My fake name is Alison Raft, and Alison Raft wants to join the IH8RA group. Join, join. Don\u2019t get mad, get even.</p><p>I have to wait for Kara or whoever heads up the group\u2014it has to be Kara\u2014to approve me. That takes an hour, but I\u2019ve got the time. As soon as it\u2019s done, I find the option that lets me send out a mass message to the inboxes of every member of my anti-fan club. Everyone in school. I get to work.</p><p>TOMORROW AT LUNCH REGINA AFTON IS GOING TO GET A BIG SURPRISE, AND WE NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE IT HAPPEN!</p><p>That will ensure the e-mail gets opened.</p><p>And then I just type. I don\u2019t even have to think. I write about Anna\u2019s dad leaving the family for someone twenty years younger and how Anna had to beg for regular visits. I write about the first time Kara had sex\u2014a vacation in Cancun. He was ten years older. The diet pills, the purging, the wig. Everyone knows that, but why not rehash? And the drunken handjob Anna gave Bruce in the ninth grade. How she thought he was small. The chastity ring Kara\u2019s father gave her after she lost the weight. How Donnie passed out the first time he had sex with Anna, because he was so wasted. I write down every doubt and insecurity, the dumb stuff, the mortifying stuff. Things I guarded with my life and that don\u2019t mean anything to me anymore. I give it all away for free.</p><p>It\u2019s crude, simple, and effective.</p><p>But the most beautiful thing about it is, this is nothing compared to the work they\u2019ve put into destroying me. Nothing. I don\u2019t even have to break a sweat. Anna\u2019s been so untouched for years that she\u2019ll wake up tomorrow and her world will end.</p><p>Thank you, Anna. For being so perfect and so ugly.</p><p>I sign my name to the e-mail\u2014my real name\u2014and then I send it to everyone.</p><p>When I wake up, I head for the computer first .</p><p>The YourSpace page is gone.</p><p>My first victory. It may be gone, but the e-mail isn\u2019t. It\u2019s in everyone\u2019s inboxes, waiting to be read. If it hasn\u2019t been read already. I can be certain of two people who did read it, and the thought turns me into a face full of teeth. I can\u2019t wait to go to school and see what I\u2019ve wrought. Damage control will be spectacular. Anna won\u2019t have time to think up ways to retaliate, because she\u2019ll be too frantic trying to keep herself above this, recovering her reputation. If she can recover it.</p><p>What a beautiful if.</p><p>Michael calls and asks if I want a ride. Yes, a million times yes. I get dressed for school and sit at the breakfast table with my parents and I eat. A piece of toast dripping with butter. It tastes fantastic. I can\u2019t believe how great my stomach feels. I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s all it took. Next thing, maybe I\u2019ll get off the antacids.</p><p>I can\u2019t wait to see Michael. When I spot his Saturn making its way up the street, I can\u2019t even play it cool. I run outside before he pulls into the driveway, and then I jerk the door open and practically throw myself inside.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Michael says, surprised. I\u2019m too cheerful, but that\u2019s how good I feel, how happy I am. I should try to get a hold on it, but I don\u2019t want to get a hold on it. I just want to be it. He pulls out of the driveway. I\u2019m not sure whether I should tell him now or wait. Wait. It\u2019ll be a surprise. I lean across the seat and kiss him.</p><p>Michael smiles at me and I look away, biting my lip. I feel sick when Hallowell High comes into sight, but it\u2019s a five-minutes-before-curtain kind of sick.</p><p>We pull into the parking lot. Michael unbuckles his seatbelt, taking his time, but I can\u2019t wait for him. I get out of the car and scope out the entrance. They\u2019re not there and I want to squeal. They aren\u2019t there; the doors are clear. People are free to come and go as they please. I sent them into hiding. Me. Wow.</p><p>I shrug my book bag over my shoulder, and Michael and I walk into school. I\u2019m five feet past the doors when Chelsea Redcliff grabs my arm. I jerk away and edge close to Michael. Chelsea was the crater face in that long list of girls on the YourSpace page. Or the small chest. I can\u2019t remember. She\u2019s neither of these things now, but if she\u2019s angry, I want someone between us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you send it? That was really you?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s all true?\u201d</p> <p>I nod again and she stands there, shocked. If I can\u2019t see this moment on Anna\u2019s face, this is really the next best thing. I watch Chelsea\u2019s mouth quirk as she enjoys this victory for...everyone. Michael divides his gaze between both of us.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a total bitch,\u201d she says in an admiring tone, and then she hurries into school so she can spread the word: It was Regina, and it\u2019s all true.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Michael asks when she\u2019s gone. I can\u2019t find the words to answer him, so I duck my head and make my way down the hall. I\u2019m immediately stared at, which is nothing new, but this is different. Even he notices. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on...?\u201d</p><p>Bruce slams into Michael then. Hard. Michael manages to stay upright, but his book bag hits the floor and his books go flying. Before I can tell Bruce he\u2019s an asshole, he\u2019s on me, pointing fingers, red-faced. And I can\u2019t help it: I smile. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking bitch, Afton.\u201d</p><p>He kicks Michael\u2019s books, sending them into the lockers. A modest crowd witnesses the whole scene, and soon the halls are buzzing, but the buzzing sounds very, very confused.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, tell me what\u2019s going on,\u201d Michael says, shoving the books back into his bag. He catches sight of something beyond me. I half-turn and spot Liz. \u201cDon\u2019t make me find out secondhand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did something,\u201d I tell him.. He doesn\u2019t even know what I did, but he gets this look on his face, like it can\u2019t be good even though it\u2019s good, it\u2019s great, it\u2019s the best. I open my mouth to tell him, but then before I can answer some sophomore I don\u2019t know passes us, pointing me out to some freshman I don\u2019t know. \u201d That\u2019s Regina Afton! Last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>This is so awesome.</p><p>Five minutes before lunch, I detour into the girls\u2019 room and try to get it together. It used to be I had to prep myself not to look so miserable when I walked through the halls.</p><p>Now I have to try not to look so high.</p><p>It\u2019s a total high. I stare at my reflection in the mirrors. I haven\u2019t seen myself this happy in ages. I run the water really cold and dab at my face and hands. I\u2019m hot.</p> <p>One of the stall doors opens and startles me. I bite the inside of my cheek hard to keep the smile off my face. I\u2019d love to smug this out all over school, but I can\u2019t. Not yet. And it\u2019s Liz, so I don\u2019t feel like smiling anymore anyway. She stares at me in the mirror and I turn the water off. I dry my hands and head for the door.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you had it in you,\u201d she says at my back.</p><p>I pause. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I do is good enough for you.\u201d I face her. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. But they got what they deserved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you deserve?\u201d she asks. \u201cCharie called me and said there was this e-mail in her inbox. Well done, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what everyone thinks?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOh, they still hate you,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they hate Anna more.\u201d I leave her and go to the cafeteria. The center table is devoid of girls. Josh, Henry, and Bruce are there, trying to uphold what\u2019s left of their popularity. Without Anna, they\u2019re nothing. I find Michael at the back, as usual.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been dogging me all day,\u201d he says, nodding at the guys. I take my seat across from him. \u201cEvery time I turn around, one of them is there.\u201d</p><p>I turn, expecting to see some Sinister Group Glare being leveled at us, but the three of them are hunched over their food.</p><p>\u201cHave they said anything to you?\u201d I ask. He shakes his head. \u201cThey probably just want to tell Anna they weren\u2019t totally useless today.\u201d</p><p>And then I look again. I can\u2019t help it. They\u2019re just there, and the table is totally dead, and it\u2019s amazing because I did that and no one\u2019s ever done that before. I turn back to Michael. The bell separated us before I could find out how he felt about it, and the way he\u2019s staring at me, I\u2019m not sure I want to find out.</p><p>\u201cSmile,\u201d he says after a minute.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell you want to do it,\u201d he says.</p><p>I flush and look away. \u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d When he doesn\u2019t immediately reply, it gets my back up. \u201cThey deserve it, Michael. You can\u2019t tell me they don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get your ass kicked,\u201d he says.</p><p>I can feel eyes on me from every direction, but there\u2019s something different about it. Like, maybe they hate me, but I\u2019m cool. It feels cool. This is mine.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d I say, and then I point. \u201cLook at that table, Michael. I have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would you want them?\u201d he asks.</p><p>It\u2019s not an accusation; it\u2019s worse. There\u2019s discomfort in his voice and...disappointment. It hurts in a weird way because I don\u2019t know what that means. They didn\u2019t deserve it? He can\u2019t think that. They deserved it. They deserve it. I could do it again and again and again and they\u2019d deserve it each time. For what they did to me.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to make me feel bad about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t get why you have to feel so good about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cIs this too Anna for you?\u201d He leans forward and says very slowly, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>I turn back to the table. Josh is gone. I wonder if he\u2019s gone to see her. She won\u2019t get her reputation back enough to hurt me. She can\u2019t. I ate breakfast today. That has to be a good omen. I smile at the thought, and when I turn back to Michael again, he\u2019s just looking more and more weirded out. Like it is too Anna for him.</p><p>The day passes in that odd, tense way a day does when you\u2019re with someone who is mad at you and you don\u2019t fully understand why. It reminds me of Anna, because she used to do that to all of us a lot. Seize up, freeze out. It was always scary.</p><p>I\u2019m mad at Michael for reminding me of that.</p><p>Still, somehow, we end up in his room.</p><p>We end up in his room on his bed.</p><p>But not like that.</p><p>We are side by side and quiet. He\u2019s on his back, staring at the ceiling, and I\u2019m on my side, staring at him. This is the kind of closeness that comes in at you from all sides, the kind that begs you to move and do something before it traps you and you can\u2019t do anything at all. Are we mad at each other? Is this a fight? I take a look around the room. It\u2019s as sparse as the rest of the house. There\u2019s a photograph of his mother on the wall. It\u2019s really strange and sad. All I have of her is a memory in a chair in an office. In this photo, she is every inch a mother. No doctor showing on her. She\u2019s sitting at a picnic table smiling at a man. Michael\u2019s father, maybe. She looks happy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He turns to me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made things really bad for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom died,\u201d he says. \u201cThings were already bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just made them worse.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s quiet for a long time. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He reaches over and his hand drifts up my side until it reaches my face, and then his palm is on my chin, but he\u2019s hesitant, and I feel bad. I understand it.</p><p>But I don\u2019t want to understand it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad at me,\u201d I say. \u201cIt was the only way it could have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asks, and before I can say anything, he runs his thumb over my lips and I close my eyes. My eyes are still closed when he kisses me. And then he stops, and when I open my eyes, the same close-distance that was between us before is there again.</p><p>I sit up and stare out the window, my back to him. Michael\u2019s bedroom overlooks the street. His house is a strange quiet. There\u2019s no calm in it, just this total emptiness. I watch the wind stir the last of some leaves off a tree across the road.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your dad?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat does he do? He\u2019s never home....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell your mom about what we did to you?\u201d I turn to him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know I was seeing her. You could\u2019ve told her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe listened to people for a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wish you\u2019d told her?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI started keeping that journal. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t finish, but I know what he\u2019s not saying. It makes him feel closer to her. I think of him carrying it everywhere. School. His car. Home. Writing incessantly just to make some kind of connection to a dead woman. His mom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say again. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad I did it to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says. It\u2019s not enough.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I ask him. \u201cThey deserved it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think...\u201d he trails off. \u201cI think some girls are just...fucked up.\u201d</p><p>He eases himself across the bed. He doesn\u2019t say he\u2019s not\u2014that he\u2019s not mad at me or that it\u2019s not weird anymore. He might be. It is. So I reach out and push his hair back from his face, and then he kisses me again, and it\u2019s like he just lets it go, just for this. I think.</p><p>He kisses my neck and he kisses my mouth. We curl up on his bed together, a tangle of arms and legs. His hand slides up my shirt, and I kiss him and I kiss him again.</p><p>I\u2019m not one of those girls.</p><p>The Formerly Fearsome Foursome is still nowhere to be found for the second day in a row. They\u2019re just gone. I\u2019m still dying to see it on their faces, but I\u2019ll settle for this not-insignificant change to the landscape. Michael and I separate at the front doors.</p><p>\u201cSee you at lunch,\u201d he tells me, heading down the hall.</p><p>When I get to my locker, there\u2019s a note tucked in it. I know who it\u2019s from instantly. Anna or Kara. Some small part of me is excited to get it, because no matter what it says, they sent it from a place that is now officially beneath me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I set my bag down, grab the note, and unfold it. But it\u2019s not from Anna.</p><p>Or Kara.</p><p>The handwriting isn\u2019t immediately familiar to me. It\u2019s a single line on a piece of paper that has a photocopied quality about it.</p> <p>I hate it here.</p><p>Michael.</p><p>His name floats into my head for no reason at all.</p><p>I turn, expecting to find him behind me. He\u2019s not. But\u2014</p><p>Oh.</p> <p>I try to work it out. Why do I have this. Why was it in my locker .</p><p>At first, I think it\u2019s a gift from him. Something so important and private\u2014he wants me to see it, wants to share it, but he wouldn\u2019t, not even now, because that\u2019s ...his mom. I flip the page over and see another line scrawled across the back:</p><p>Underneath the water fountain outside of Hartnett\u2019s.</p><p>The handwriting is deliberately warped.</p><p>This isn\u2019t bad. Not yet. I crumple the paper and rush for Hartnett\u2019s room. I\u2019m halfway down the hall when I realize I\u2019ve left my book bag sitting in front of my locker, but I don\u2019t care. The bell feels like it could go soon, so I leave it.</p><p>This is more important.</p> <p>Ellen Pines is taking the longest drink of her life when I finally reach the fountain, and my head is pounding, swimming. I wait and wait and I\u2019m about to shove her out of the way, when she stands, wipes her mouth, and goes. I run my hand along the porcelain underside until I find the next piece of paper taped to it.</p><p>I rip it off and unfold it.</p><p>I think I liked being an Unstable Freak better before she died.</p><p>I hate everyone in this school, but I want to tell them about her.</p><p>I somehow manage to keep the guilt that\u2019s invading every space inside of me from turning into tears. This is so private. I flip the paper over and it directs me to the fountain outside of Holt\u2019s office. No one\u2019s there. I rip the note off and unfold it. I don\u2019t want to read it.</p><p>But I do.</p><p>These people all look the same. They walk the same, wear the same type of clothes, talk the same. Nothing that comes out of their mouths is important.</p><p>These people are wasters.</p> <p>It leads me to the fountain on the second floor. It\u2019s bad.</p><p>I\u2019m the antichrist with the anger-management problem. That\u2019s the latest.</p><p>Everyone here is afraid. It\u2019s sort of amazing in a really dumb way. Liz says it\u2019s her fault. I like Liz She\u2019s better than most of what\u2019s walking the halls.</p><p>I shove my hand into my pocket and find an antacid, and then I shove it into my mouth and chew. The next note sends me back to the fountain on the first floor, right by the entrance.</p><p>I unfold it.</p><p>I hate it here.</p><p>Even the poor quality of the photocopy can\u2019t hide how hard Michael wrote these words. The ink bleeds out, stressed edges around the final sentence. I can\u2019t picture him this way. Hurt and angry and ready to explode\u2014like me. He worked so hard to make sure no one ever saw it. At the fountain beside the lab, the next paper reads this:</p><p>I need a reason.</p><p>I close my eyes and flip the note over. Open them.</p><p>Storage room off the gym.</p><p>The bell rings. I make a run for it. The storage room off the gym. Michael\u2019s journal. They have Michael\u2019s journal. They dogged him all day yesterday. Why didn\u2019t I pay attention? I should\u2019ve known. I should\u2019ve known. When I reach the storage room, there\u2019s one last note taped to the door. I rip it off. I don\u2019t need to read it.</p><p>I push the door open.</p><p>Anna.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the notebook?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cClose the door, Regina,\u201d she says calmly. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the fucking notebook now, Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already back in Michael\u2019s hands. He didn\u2019t even know it was gone. Now close the door, Regina, so we can talk.\u201d</p><p>I close the door. \u201cGive me the photocopies then.\u201d</p><p>She crosses her arms and looks me up and down slowly. That look. Like I\u2019m not good enough to be acknowledged by her. Even after all this. And then the reality of the situation hits me full on, sinking into my bones, making me step back. I don\u2019t understand how she\u2019s standing here and looking at me like\u2014</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014\u201d I can\u2019t even finish the question.</p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t think I\u2019d just sit around and stare at my hands, did you? Just let you have it?\u201d Anna raises an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s more your style, Regina.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve gotten bored with you by now if you\u2019d backed off. I can spray-paint your locker, lock you in storage rooms, ruin your things, broadcast your secrets all over the Internet, and I can make everyone hate you twice as much as they used to, and you still haven\u2019t learned.\u201d She cocks her head to the side. \u201cRight after your e-mail went out, I started brainstorming. That\u2019s the trick: Don\u2019t waste time. I wanted to figure out how to bury you so far into the ground, you\u2019d finally get it and never bother me again. Except it was harder than I thought it\u2019d be, because the problem with you is you don\u2019t seem to care about what happens to you anymore.\u201d</p><p>I bite the inside of my cheek so hard there\u2019s blood. I let the coppery taste reach my tongue and focus on it. Anna has Michael\u2019s journal.</p><p>She has his journal.</p><p>\u201cI was stumped, but then Josh said you\u2019d probably care about what happened to Michael. I guess...he\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to you?\u201d She grins, laughing a little as she watches my own words turn my face a ghostly shade of white. \u201cSo cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d she says over me, \u201cJosh reminded me about Michael\u2019s notebook that he always carries around. His journal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, I thought we should try to get our hands on it, because maybe there was something in it about you we could use. I was skeptical that Hayden had anything interesting to say, but after Bruce got it...\u201d She laughs. \u201cAnd what kind of moron leaves their journal in their car, by the way? Anyway, after Bruce got it, I was riveted from page one. Michael\u2019s very sensitive, did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a trait you find in people who have souls,\u201d I manage.</p><p>Her face changes. She\u2019s angry, still smarting from what I did to her.</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you think he\u2019d feel if the contents of his soul were plastered all over this school? Do you think that would bother him? Given everything he\u2019s written, I think it\u2019d bother me, if I were him. He doesn\u2019t have much good to say about the people in this school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? Michael doesn\u2019t care what people here think of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut would he care if they knew he was so distraught about his dead mother he wanted to die? Like, kill himself? Not that he ever came right out and said it, but it\u2019s there. It\u2019s so obvious.\u201d</p><p>My brain tries to process Michael that far gone and alone because of\u2014me. And I knew it. It\u2019s not like Liz ever told me, but when it\u2019s vague, when no one\u2019s telling you exactly what you did, it\u2019s different. It makes it easier.</p><p>\u201cSeriously!\u201d Anna says, relishing the stunned look on my face. \u201cI mean, even I didn\u2019t think he was that depressed! He hid it well, huh? Not like Liz. I always got this vibe from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a new low, Anna, even for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to do it, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him. I\u2019ll just tell him. No fun for you if I get there first\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell him and I\u2019ll take this to Holt.\u201d Anna digs into her pocket and hands me another folded piece of paper. I don\u2019t want it, but she keeps her hand out until I take it. \u201cThat was my favorite entry.\u201d</p><p>My hands are shaking. I don\u2019t want her to see them shaking. I have to wait until I feel steady enough to read it.</p><p>It\u2019s a single line.</p><p>I want to kill everyone in this stupid school.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even need to read between the lines for that one,\u201d Anna says. \u201cNo room for interpretation. It\u2019s sort of poetic, isn\u2019t it? \u2018I want to kill everyone in this stupid school\u2019 Strong sentiment. Dangerous sentiment.\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first half of his journal is basically about a crazy, depressed boy with a dead mother who hates everyone in this school so much he wants to kill them. In this post-Columbine age, you know the rules, Reg.\u201d She nods at the paper. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to report any warning signs we see. His journal is officially grounds for expulsion...probably a hell of a lot of therapy. They could put him away for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014he\u2019s not\u2014I know Michael and he\u2019s not\u2014\u201d He\u2019s not like that anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou know Michael,\u201d she points out. \u201cNobody else here does. In fact, what everyone here thinks they know about Michael pretty much supports the kind of picture I\u2019m painting. And whose fault is that, by the way? Oh, right. Yours. Well, and mine. But I\u2019ll let you take most of the credit for that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything to you,\u201d I choke out.</p><p>\u201cWell, at first I thought I might be pushing it,\u201d she agrees, \u201cbut it turns out Michael\u2019s not my biggest fan. It\u2019s all in his journal: I\u2019m destined to be a future trophy wife who\u2019s catatonic all the time because I\u2019m always on pills to dull the pain of my life.\u201d</p><p>I go completely numb. My pulse stops spazzing, my heart stills.</p><p>I stare at the paper in my hand.</p><p>I want to kill everyone in this stupid school.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I ask slowly.</p><p>She sighs. \u201cDefinitely not a truce. You don\u2019t get away with what you did to me. You get to suffer for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re reconciling!\u201d She claps her hands. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone gets to think! Anna and Regina\u2014best friends again! Can you imagine the looks on everyone\u2019s faces when we walk into school together tomorrow? Any respect you earned from your YourSpace e-mail stunt will be instantly gone, and everyone will be so distracted by this insane turn of events, they\u2019ll forget all about it. They\u2019ll think I must be pretty good if I can get you back into the fold, and let\u2019s face it, I am. And you\u2014\u201d She grins. \u201cYou, Regina, will act like you love it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m shaking my head no, but she just keeps talking.</p><p>\u201cBut really, I\u2019ll own you, and Michael is dead to you. You will drop him, with no explanations, nothing. He\u2019ll have to sit there trying to figure it out until he gives up and hates you all over again.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll tell him.</p> <p>I\u2019ll get out of this storage room and I\u2019ll tell him.</p><p>Anna studies me. It must be all over my face, because she says, \u201cIf I think you\u2019ve tipped him off, I\u2019ll plaster his journal all over school and take it to Holt. If you refuse to drop him, I\u2019ll do the same.\u201d</p><p>My heart stills. Expulsion. Those pages all over school. His grief. His secrets. His ruin. I can\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>\u201cThat means whatever happens to Michael is your fault,\u201d Anna says, reading my mind. \u201cAnd even if he does find out the truth, do you think he\u2019d forgive you for putting him through this bullshit? He\u2019s already forgiven you for a lot. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to be with you, you know. He put that in his journal, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d I whisper.</p> <p>Anna closes her eyes briefly, basking in this moment. This is Anna at her finest. This is the Anna everyone is afraid of. The Anna I\u2019m afraid of.</p><p>She opens her eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t you read the entry I taped to the door?\u201d</p><p>I clench my hands into fists. \u201cI hate you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did it to yourself.\u201d She nudges me out of the way to get to the door and hesitates. \u201cHe\u2019s really sweet, though, isn\u2019t he? Anyway, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I dig into my pocket for the entry she was talking out. I unfold it and read it.</p><p>And then I start to cry.</p> <p>Weird month. The kind of emotional evolution she\u2019d be proud of.</p><p>It\u2019s hard, but\u2014I like her. I think it\u2019s going to be good.</p><p>The bell rings. I leave the storage room and keep walking until I\u2019m pushing my way through the front doors. I can\u2019t risk Michael seeing me like this, because he\u2019ll ask and I\u2019ll be weak and I\u2019ll tell him, and then Anna will find out and ruin him again, and I can\u2019t do that to him, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t. I hit the parking lot, gasping, aching. Stupid, ugly tears, all over my face.</p><p>I almost had them.</p><p>I\u2019ve never felt a more painful miss in my life.</p><p>I go home.</p><p>Anna calls nine hours later.</p><p>\u201cSkirt and cardigans tomorrow,\u201d she says. \u201cThought you\u2019d want to know.\u201d</p> <p>Skirts and cardigans .</p><p>My throat is all closed up. I try to swallow down my morning coffee and I try to take an antacid but I can\u2019t do either, and my parents are just sitting there, and I can\u2019t stand it, and I don\u2019t know what to do with myself, so I head for school.</p><p>My outfit feels stiff and gross, and I can\u2019t stop picturing his face when he sees me in it\u2014a fashion clone. The school parking lot is completely empty. I position myself in front of the doors and wait, the familiarity of it suffocating me, until I find myself inside, in the washroom, hunched over a toilet, dry heaving.</p><p>Because there\u2019s nothing in my stomach to puke up.</p><p>I lean against the door and press a shaking hand against my mouth. I could cry, but I\u2019m afraid if I start, I won\u2019t stop. I shove an antacid in my mouth and chew it and then try to get it down with a little spit. I can\u2019t do this.</p><p>I can\u2019t do this.</p><p>Those four words over and over again in my head while time creeps by and the school fills. School noises leech in through the walls, and it eats me up. I take a deep breath and fumble with the door, but I can\u2019t open it.</p><p>The bell rings. I miss my grand entrance.</p><p>I stay in the stall.</p><p>I\u2019m going to stay in this stall. I wedge myself against the door, close my eyes, and I stay still until I\u2019m uncomfortable, and even then I don\u2019t move.</p><p>If I\u2019m not moving, nothing bad is happening.</p><p>Every so often people come in, and then the bell rings again and there\u2019s that surge before the next period. I listen to girls talk at the sinks, over stalls, and they peter out, and it\u2019s quiet again. It stays quiet for a long time, until the door opens and I hear footsteps cut across the room. A stall door is pushed open and then another and another, until it\u2019s the one next to mine, and then it\u2019s mine. But I\u2019ve locked it and it doesn\u2019t give.</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d It\u2019s Marta. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s end this now.\u201d Kara. \u201cAnna keeps those pages really close, Regina.\u201d</p><p>I open the door. Marta and Kara exchange a glance and a smile. I catch sight of my reflection in the mirror. My skin looks waxy, pale.</p><p>\u201cLunch in five,\u201d Kara says.</p><p>I push past them and head straight for the sink. I run the tap hot and then cold. \u201cGreat,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI want you to walk behind me,\u201d Kara says. \u201cFrom this point on. Just walk behind me, and don\u2019t talk to me unless I address you first.\u201d Marta laughs. \u201cKara!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard Anna,\u201d Kara says. \u201cWe own her. Hurry the fuck up, Regina. We\u2019ve waited long enough.\u201d</p><p>I grip the edges of the sink. \u201cGive me a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201d Now .\u201d</p><p>I run the water as hard as it will go.</p><p>\u201c...Let her have her second,\u201d Kara finally mutters. They leave me at the sink. My second turns into a minute, and then another. The door opens again. Anna.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had your second,\u201d she spits. I turn off the tap and we leave the washroom. Jeanette\u2019s there with the others. As the five of us make our way down the hall together, Anna leans over. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you chickened out this morning, Regina. A lunchtime entrance will be better. Everyone will see it.\u201d</p><p>It isn\u2019t until we\u2019re at the door to the cafeteria that I begin to register the people around us. They\u2019re whispering and pointing, and then I remember our outfits, totally completing this nightmare. I glance at the other girls and it\u2019s skirts and cardigans all the way down. I roll my shoulders and try to get the dirty feeling off me, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>I take a deep breath and enter the cafeteria with them.</p><p>It\u2019s not like everyone notices at once. There\u2019s no awed hush as we make our way to the center table. The room is buzzing the way it usually is, until the realization Regina Afton is back in hits the left side, and there\u2019s a subtle shift, the frequency changes, and makes its way back across the cafeteria. I feel lightheaded, and my neck is so tense when I turn my head to look at the Garbage Table, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll snap.</p><p>Michael\u2019s oblivious. It hasn\u2019t reached him yet. I\u2019m comforted by this, like it buys me time\u2013for what, I don\u2019t know\u2014</p><p>But then he looks up.</p><p>His eyes travel over Anna and Kara, and when they get to me, there\u2019s this flicker, something torn between recognition\u2014 I know that girl \u2014and total incomprehension: What is she doing over there? Anna jostles me over to the center table, but I can\u2019t look away from him, until his mouth drops open and then I have to.</p><p>Josh, Henry, and Bruce are already at the table, dutifully waiting for us girls. It\u2019s so horribly familiar, I wander to the seat next to Josh, where I used to sit, before Anna pulls me back.</p><p>\u201cBest friends should sit together,\u201d she says.</p><p>She takes my old seat and settles in next to Josh. His lunch tray is fixed up for two. He slides her half over and gives her a kiss on the cheek. Anna points to the seat between her and Bruce, and I sit down. Being this close to Bruce is disgusting and recalls the smell of the supply closet, which sends my gut into a somersault routine. I try to ignore it and take a slow look around the table. Josh\u2019s expression is unreadable, or he just doesn\u2019t care. Marta is picking at her fingernails, waiting for a cue from a higher-up. Jeanette is giving the straw in her juice box head, hoping Henry will notice. He does. Kara\u2019s oddly somber. I thought she\u2019d enjoy this more. A lot more.</p><p>Anna unwraps a granola bar and looks at me. \u201cAren\u2019t you eating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna, if you make me eat, I will puke all over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen at least smile. Let everyone know how happy you are to be here.\u201d</p><p>I force a smile at her and the right side of my mouth starts twitch- \u2018 ing. I feel Michael\u2019s eyes on me now the most. I really, really don\u2019t want to see his face.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Bruce leans back. \u201cIf you\u2019re not eating, Regina, I need a drink. I\u2019m sure Kara and Marta could use one, too. Why don\u2019t you run up there and get us some Coke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be nice,\u201d Marta says. \u201cOn Regina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have my wallet.\u201d</p><p>Bruce digs into his pocket and tosses a bill at me. \u201cGet it, girl.\u201d I stare at the money.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Anna says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to smile.\u201d</p><p>I grab the bill, push my chair out, and stand. I make the biggest, most painful close-mouthed smile I can muster, and then I\u2019m in a long lineup. Smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>My heart goes into overdrive. Michael. Right next to me in this line. I keep my eyes on the menu tacked to the wall, still smiling. I can\u2019t look at him or I\u2019ll give it away. If I give it away, he is fucked. So the only thing I can think to do is pretend that he\u2019s not here. I stare straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a joke, right?\u201d The line moves up. \u201cRegina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a good talk yesterday,\u201d I say. The line moves up again. I want it to go faster. I can feel the center table. All their eyes on me. \u201cWe\u2019re friends again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe finally believed me about Donnie,\u201d I say distractedly. The line moves up again, and I rub the back of my neck. I blink once, twice, three times. Don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry. \u201cSo it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d he repeats. \u201cNot after yesterday.\u201d I reach the cash register and ask for three Cokes. He keeps talking. \u201cWhy are you doing this? You\u2019re wearing the same outfits\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The lunch lady hands me the drinks. I hand her the bill.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Michael,\u201d I say.</p><p>Anna \u201crescues\u201d me then. She wraps an arm around me, and I try to act like it\u2019s a welcome move by forcing my third smile of the day. At her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I hand her one of the Cokes and shove the change in my pocket. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s take these back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking,\u201d Michael says. \u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>I push past him.

He\u2019ll trail me home and he\u2019ll try to get me to talk. I\u2019m so desperate to avoid it, I ask Anna for a ride home and she laughs in my face, so I have to detour down the main street and then detour into Ford\u2019s, where I buy three packs of antacids.</p><p>Michael calls. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever called. I don\u2019t answer. And then Anna calls and tells me yellow. Tomorrow we\u2019ll be wearing yellow.</p><p>I can\u2019t eat my dinner.</p> <p>I skip breakfast and head to school, because I don\u2019t want to risk run ning into Michael. I stake out a spot at the front door and wait for the rest of the group to show, just like old times. It takes about thirty minutes. Kara\u2019s first to show. She stands next to me, quiet. I just want to kill her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get comfortable,\u201d she says.</p><p>I turn to her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get comfortable,\u201d she repeats slowly. \u201cThis was Anna\u2019s idea, but I\u2019d rather see you dead after that e-mail than pretend we\u2019re friends for the rest of the year, no matter how miserable it makes you. I\u2019m not done with you, so don\u2019t get comfortable.\u201d</p><p>It never stops.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me, Kara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your back, Regina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo fuck yourself, Kara.\u201d</p> <p>Jeanette and Marta bound up to us\u2014to Kara\u2014then. I put a little space between us. Waiting for Anna is hell on my stomach, and I\u2019ve taken three antacids by the time she arrives, wearing one of the lowest cut tops I\u2019ve ever seen. Marta whistles.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t plan on bending over today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in front of Josh,\u201d she replies, grinning.</p><p>Michael\u2019s car pulls into the parking lot before I can roll my eyes at what she\u2019s said. My stomach twinges. \u201cLet\u2019s go in. Please.\u201d</p><p>Anna spots him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I watch him make his way toward the school. It doesn\u2019t really hurt yet, seeing him but not being near him. I think I\u2019m still in shock. I hunch my shoulders and edge closer to Anna, like that\u2019ll make me invisible, but she notices and steps away from me.</p><p>When Michael reaches us, he keeps walking.</p><p>\u201cHe cannot have gotten over it that fast,\u201d Anna says, watching him go. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him, did you? Because if you did\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t\u2014I haven\u2019t talked to him at all. He called me last night and I didn\u2019t even pick up. I didn\u2019t tell him, Anna, I swear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t.\u201d She grins. \u201cI just wanted to see you squirm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>Kara, Marta, and Jeanette gasp. We\u2019re all wearing yellow.</p><p>I walk away. Anna calls me back. I keep walking. I\u2019m shoving my hands into my pockets, popping two antacids. I stop on the second floor and lean against a row of lockers. They won\u2019t find me here for a couple of minutes. But Liz does. Liz finds me. When she walks into my line of vision, I groan.</p><p>\u201cWhat were they offering?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cLiz, go away,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cMichael asked me if I knew anything,\u201d she says. \u201cHe thinks you have a reason. Like he really thinks that what you\u2019re doing right now doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna wanted to be friends again,\u201d I say. \u201cI can spend the rest of my year getting locked in closets or I can be friends with Michael. And you should be happy. You didn\u2019t want me anywhere near him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bitch,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cHey, self-preservation. Don\u2019t blame me because you and Michael were too stupid to figure it out and got hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so shocking,\u201d she says sarcastically. \u201cBut once a coward...\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t wait until I\u2019m too dead inside to feel this. I leave her there. I make my way to my locker. Josh, Anna, and Henry are there, and all of a sudden I can\u2019t see. I can\u2019t see, I can\u2019t breathe. I turn before they see me. I\u2019m halfway down the hall from them when the bell rings and I realize I need my books for class.</p><p>I head back to my locker, and they\u2019re still there. I shove Josh aside and fumble with my lock. I don\u2019t say a word. They don\u2019t say a word to me.</p><p>Because I just have to be a part of this scene. Not belong to it.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Anna is saying, squeezing Josh\u2019s shoulder, nearly falling out of her top. Josh gets all disappointed when she doesn\u2019t. \u201cOne more party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s getting kind of cold out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the bonfire\u2019s for,\u201d Henry says.</p><p>Josh punches him in the arm. \u201cYou just want to get wasted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need an excuse,\u201d Henry replies. \u201cBut I do like getting wasted in a group setting.\u201d He belches. \u201cI refuse to accept that last monstrosity of a party as the last party of the season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d Anna eyes me. \u201cCome on, Josh. This weekend. You said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Josh replies. \u201cMy dad\u2019s here this weekend, and I need to get some of his prescriptions and restock first. I mean, if you want it to be a really good party...\u201d</p><p>The bell rings. They trail down the hall. When they\u2019re about twenty steps away from me, Anna notices I\u2019m not trailing after them. She stops. Turns. Snaps her fingers. Points to the empty space beside her.</p><p>\u201cRegina,\u201d she says. \u201cHere.\u201d My only solace is the weekend.</p><p>It comes.</p><p>And then it goes.</p><p>My YourSpace revenge is dead in the water. Anna\u2019s scheme works better than even she anticipated; the re-formation of the Fearsome Five-some distracts everyone for a second and settles too quickly. Everyone in this school has seen me stand beside Anna before.</p><p>It\u2019s new, but it\u2019s old.</p><p>Gym.</p><p>Nelson is dividing us into teams for basketball when I start feeling not right. I take an antacid before I realize it\u2019s not my stomach\u2014 it\u2019s my head. It doesn\u2019t feel attached to my neck, and then it does, and then I\u2019m very aware of a slow-building pressure behind my eyes that threatens to become the kind of headache that will make me vomit\u2014or would, if there was anything in my stomach to vomit up.</p><p>I raise my hand. Nelson points at me. \u201cWhat it is, Afton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I be excused?\u201d I ask. \u201cI don\u2019t feel well.\u201d</p><p>I wish I could take it back. The whole class hears it. That\u2019s Anna, that\u2019s Michael, that\u2019s Kara, that\u2019s Josh, that\u2019s Donnie. I don\u2019t want them looking at me, and now they are. Nelson studies me, and I must look bad because she doesn\u2019t run me through the usual twenty questions reserved for suspected fakers.</p><p>\u201cHayden,\u201d she says. Michael looks up. \u201cEscort your friend to the nurse\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like someone dumped a bucket of ice down my shirt. Michael crosses the gym. My eyes meet Anna\u2019s: She gives me a warning look. And a smirk.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d he says.</p><p>Nelson resumes splitting the class, and Michael and I make our way out. The throbbing in my head gets worse. When we hit the hall, I focus on the quiet and pray it stays, but it doesn\u2019t. Of course it doesn\u2019t. He wants answers.</p><p>\u201cWhat do they have on you?\u201d</p><p>I exhale slowly. I don\u2019t know whether to feel really good or bad that he doesn\u2019t believe I\u2019d do that to him. It makes it harder, either way.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have anything on me,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou look like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He grabs me by the arm. \u201cYou were so happy to be rid of them and now you\u2019re friends again? Bullshit. What do they have on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said they don\u2019t have anything on me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have to,\u201d he says, desperate. I can see the hurt building, and my stomach isn\u2019t having it. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be doing this to me if they didn\u2019t have something on you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I focus on the poster tacked to the wall behind his head. A bedraggled kitten is clinging to a tree branch. Hang in there! I can\u2019t think around my headache. \u201cI told you. Anna found out that it was true about Donnie, that Kara lied, so she\u2019s\u2014she felt terrible about it. So\u2014we\u2019re friends again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can barely lie,\u201d he says. I start protesting halfheartedly, because I really don\u2019t feel well. It makes it easy for him to talk over me. \u201cIf that\u2019s the truth, then what about Kara? Anna wouldn\u2019t let Kara get away with that.\u201d</p><p>Goddammit. If he were Jeanette or Marta he would\u2019ve bought it by now. I\u2019m not making friends with people who are smart, from this point on. Ever again.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he begs.</p><p>\u201cI told you. We\u2019re friends again. I told Liz\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean what you said to Liz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Michael,\u201d I burst out. \u201cBecause whatever it is, even after everything between us, I still weighed it\u2014them or you\u2014 and I didn\u2019t choose you. I knew how hard it was for you to choose me, and I still picked them. I mean, that\u2019s basically picking their bullshit over you, right? I didn\u2019t choose you, and I totally wasted your time, so even if they do have something on me, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s a hit. Finally. He flinches like I\u2019ve slapped him and takes a step back.</p><p>\u201cI put myself out there for you,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed someone to put between me and Anna, and you probably never even really liked me.\u201d I dig the knife further in, but I\u2019m not sure I need to. \u201cYou were really lonely, and I was there after a long time of no one being there.\u201d</p> <p>He takes another step back. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>I wish he would shout at me. He doesn\u2019t. This quiet devastation creeps across his face and he fights it, and it reminds me of that day in the diner, and I feel like my heart is breaking. But it\u2019s still not as bad as what Anna will do to him if I tell him the truth.</p><p>\u201cI should have known,\u201d he finally says, and I wince because he was the best thing that ever happened to me. He takes another step back. \u201cEasy way out, every single time. Liz told me\u2014 fuck \u2014I can\u2019t believe I let you do this to me twice\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t wait for him to go, so I go.</p><p>By the time I reach the washroom, my head is killing me, and the disgusting fluorescent lights overhead makes it feel worse. I gag over the sink, but nothing comes out. I lean forward and take deep, even breaths in and out, and then I run the water as cold as it will go, cupping my hands together for a drink. It doesn\u2019t help. I wet a paper towel, sit on the floor\u2014gross\u2014and press it against my eyes.</p> <p>After a while, the paper towel loses its chill, but I can\u2019t find the will to get up and wet it again. Michael hates me. He hates me. I start to cry, keeping the paper towel against my eyes and letting it soak up my tears. When the door swings open, I can\u2019t inspire myself to care. Getting up and trying to act okay is so beyond me right now. \u201cOh, Regina.\u201d</p><p>Anna\u2019s voice is motherly. Awful. I keep the towel against my eyes. She crosses the room and sits beside me. She presses something crumbly and dry into my hands. I look down. An oatmeal cookie. I blink and take in the room. Anna\u2019s beside me. Kara\u2019s leaning against the door, ensuring no one will come in.</p><p>I don\u2019t care if Anna sees me cry, but Kara...</p><p>I wipe at my eyes with my free hand.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d Anna urges me. I shake my head. She grabs me by the chin and makes me look at her. \u201cCome on. I don\u2019t make you that sick. Eat or else.\u201d</p><p>That whole year she thought I was starving myself\u2014after Kara actually did starve herself\u2014she used that voice. Eat. I take a bite of the cookie and revive a little at the food in my mouth. My stomach doesn\u2019t want it. I clamp my hand over my mouth.</p> <p>It takes forever to swallow.</p><p>\u201cKara, wait outside,\u201d Anna says, when I finally do.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No way. I want to see this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait outside now.\u201d</p><p>Kara knows better than to argue. She yanks the door open and steps into the hall.</p><p>\u201cTalk to Michael?\u201d Anna asks me. I nod. \u201cDid it hurt?\u201d</p><p>The last three words set me off. My face crumples and I bring my knees up to my chest, burying my face in them.</p><p>\u201cSo now you know exactly how I felt when I found out you slept with Donnie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus Christ, Anna. I didn\u2019t fucking sleep with Donnie. He tried to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Shut. Up. Listen to me: All that time I thought you were my best friend,\u201d she says. \u201cYou were like a sister to me. Now, thanks to Michael\u2019s journal, I find out I just made you sick. This will never get better for you, okay? I want you to understand what you ruined and how good you had it.\u201d She tucks an errant strand of hair behind my ear. I jerk away. \u201cAnd then ...I want you to be sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell her desperately. \u201cAnna, I\u2019m sorry\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at this,\u201d Anna says as Jeanette, Marta, and Kara cluster around her. We\u2019ve finished gym. Fresh out of the showers and in the changing rooms. Anna is holding up a thin silver chain with a silver pendant dangling off it. \u201cJust because. That\u2019s what he said.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like partying all night with people you hate and bypassing home to go straight to your job so you can work all day with more people you hate.</p><p>And never stopping.</p><p>\u201cOoh, my God,\u201d Jeanette says softly, cupping it in her palm. Anna grins, beside herself with squeally-girl joy. \u201cYou know what that means, right? Sex.\u201d</p><p>And it does, too. I have something similar abandoned in a jewelry box at home. And the five of us talked about what that meant when Josh gave it to me then. This is a special kind of hell\u2014listening to my ex-best friend wax about fucking my ex-boyfriend. I get dressed as slowly as possible so I can avoid walking down the hall with them, but it\u2019s a give-and-take. I have to listen to this stupid babbling until they go.</p><p>I stare at Anna until she notices and sets the necklace back against her neck. I can\u2019t resist: \u201cDoesn\u2019t it bother you at all that whatever you do with Josh, I did first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you do, I do better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a learning curve,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of hell,\u201d Marta interjects, \u201chas anyone seen Donnie lately? He\u2019s lost like, twenty pounds. He looks like a piece of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be good enough for you now, Kara,\u201d I say, pulling on my pants. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s desperate enough to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t touch your castoffs with a thirty-foot pole,\u201d she snaps. \u201cI have some standards.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s always something amazing about watching people fuck themselves over. We all realize what Kara\u2019s said at the exact same moment. Anna\u2019s jaw drops, and Kara\u2019s face goes from peach to pale in two seconds flat. If I could guarantee she did something this stupid every day, getting up in the morning would be infinitely easier.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Kara spews apologies. They dribble from her mouth and fall on deaf ears.</p><p>\u201cAnna, I\u2019m sorry\u2014I am so, so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it like that. I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Josh is Regina\u2019s castoff, isn\u2019t he, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! That was at Regina, it wasn\u2019t at you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Kara.\u201d</p><p>Silence. This is the kind of silence that used to make me so uncomfortable and queasy to be in the middle of and grateful to not be on the receiving end of.</p><p>I like it today.</p><p>The rest of the girls get dressed quietly and leave when the bell rings. I pull my shirt on and then I leave, too. As soon as I step into the busy halls, I feel weight, pressure. My chest tightens and it\u2019s, like\u2014grief. Everywhere.</p><p>I pull the collar of my shirt into my mouth and bite and try to get through the moment. I don\u2019t know that I can get through this moment.</p><p>I need to see who I\u2019m doing this for.</p><p>I stake out Michael\u2019s locker. He\u2019s been avoiding me and hanging out with Liz, which makes sense. I\u2019ve only glimpsed him in the halls, and I can\u2019t stare at him at lunch too long because Anna gets off on it when I do, and I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll look back and I will finally break. After a couple minutes, he shows. He looks as unaffected as he always does, and I try to talk myself out of this loss, but I can\u2019t. I hope he\u2019s angry. I hope he hates me, because then he can have that and it\u2019ll carry him through.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really obvious,\u201d a voice says beside me.</p><p>I close my eyes briefly. \u201cGo away, Josh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna told me to tell you.\u201d He points down the hall, where Anna\u2019s with Bruce and Kara and Marta and Jeanette. She smiles and waves. \u201cYou\u2019re being really obvious.\u201d</p><p>Michael looks up and spots us both. I swallow down the bile making its way up my throat and turn to Josh. \u201cNice necklace you gave Anna. I totally still have mine. That means sex, right?\u201d</p><p>Josh scratches the back of his neck. \u201cAnd I\u2019m totally not comfortable having this conversation with my ex-girlfriend. And why the hell should you care? At least I waited until after we broke up before I decided to screw other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, the lady beckons.\u201d He takes me by the arm and forces me down the hall, smiling at Anna as we approach. As soon as he\u2019s close enough, he moves away from me, wraps his arm around her, and gives her a light kiss on the lips. Barf.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s-out-of-town-Thursday,\u201d he says, kissing her between words. She\u2019s putty in his hands. \u201cI\u2019ve restocked. It\u2019s short notice and I\u2019d rather it be a weekend, but this is our only chance, and the weather\u2019s supposed to be good, so...party. My house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the way you think.\u201d She grins.</p><p>Josh turns to the hall, projecting his voice and silencing the idle chatter around us. \u201cParty at my house Thursday. Got that?\u201d He points to a pair of juniors. \u201cGet the word out. Last one this season.\u201d He turns back to Anna and kisses her on the nose. \u201cYou will be there, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She giggles. He smiles and marches down the hall, the boys trailing after him. They stop to tell anyone who\u2019s someone about the party.</p><p>Anna turns to us, and she has this stupid, stupid look on her face. \u201cOh, my God, I can\u2019t wait.\u201d And then it\u2019s like, this group squeal that I don\u2019t take part of. She notices this and takes offense. \u201cOh, and Regina? You\u2019re coming. Designated driver.\u201d</p><p>Kara snickers. \u201cTry not to get almost raped this time, okay?\u201d</p><p>Die. They laugh. The bell rings. We make our way down the hall, jostling through the crowd until we reach the top of the stairs. She has to die.</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d Kara says, jamming her elbow into my side.</p><p>I don\u2019t even think about it: My foot slips in front of hers, sending her tumbling down the stairs. A shocked noise passes my lips. I can\u2019t believe I did it, but I\u2019m glad I did, until her fall is interrupted by a group of stair-loitering freshman. I stand at the top of the stairs and watch Anna, Marta, and Jeanette rush to her. I read Kara\u2019s lips: I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine. She shrugs them off and looks my way. She knows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><p>I turn. Michael. And the way he says it is so damning, so disgusted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth it,\u201d I whisper.</p> <p>It\u2019s for him. He shakes his head and walks away. I force myself down the stairs and past Anna and everyone while they\u2019re distracted. I don\u2019t feel like going straight to an empty house, so I wander around town for a while.</p><p>Almost every place in Hallowell is the same kind of unremarkable, except for Josh\u2019s place. I stay away from that side of town and turn onto Hainsworth. Jeanette lives here. Donnie. I can see his home from here. It\u2019s all gray siding with a weak garden out front, but every little bit of it is immaculately kept.</p><p>And his black convertible is in the center of it all.</p><p>He found it.</p><p>I take a quick look around. The place looks empty. I approach the house, his car, and I take it all in. It should be fantastic. I should love the ugly lines I made down his convertible. I should love that everyone else can see them, too. I should love that there\u2019s a crack down the windshield that wasn\u2019t there before. I don\u2019t. It makes me miss Michael.</p> <p>I circle the car, and when I return to the scratches, I reach out. I want to see what that kind of damage feels like. I press my fingers against the metal body.</p><p>The front door bursts open.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck away from my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you it\u2019d turn up,\u201d I say.</p><p>Donnie stands there, raging on the steps. I edge over to the front of the car and bring my hand to the windshield. Baiting him should feel good. It doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGet away from my car,\u201d he repeats. I run my hand over the fresh crack on the windshield. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p> <p>I trace the line in the glass down to the windshield wipers.</p><p>\u201cStop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, you want me to stop? Hey, tell Anna. Go and tell Anna that you tried to rape me. Tell her.\u201d</p><p>His mouth hangs open, like he can\u2019t decide to step forward or back into the house, and I hate the silence, so I kick the convertible as hard as I can.</p><p>\u201cAfton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you get, Donnie.\u201d I kick it again. \u201cFor what you did to me.\u201d</p><p>He turns purple-faced and makes his way over to me. A car rolls down the street, slowing as it passes. I take the opportunity to move out, and when I glance back, he\u2019s heading back inside his house, slamming the door shut behind him.</p><p>I glance at the clock on my nightstand. Eight-thirty. Probably everyone is well on their way to wasted. Designated driver. Boring.</p> <p>I used to really hate the last party of the season, even if I drank until I was blind. They were always bigger. Louder. More drinks, dancing, drugs, fucking, more fucking around. Last year, Henry totaled his car while driving home. He broke his collarbone.</p><p>I change into a black hoodie and jeans\u2014incognito. Running into Anna is inevitable, but I don\u2019t have to make it easy for her to spot me.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s nice,\u201d Mom says as I make my way to the door. I stop and turn to her. She smiles. \u201cThat you and Josh can still be friends. Have fun at the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say.</p><p>When I reach Josh\u2019s house, instant sensory overload. Too many sights, sounds, and smells. It\u2019s chilly out, but all the bodies give the illusion of warmth. I pass these crazy girls dancing on the front lawn. They\u2019re in the moment, and the moment is them, and the moment is perfect. The party is here and it\u2019s perfect. Music. Cars. Friends.</p><p>I\u2019m not feeling it.</p><p>I step into the heart of the scene, and in a minute flat, a bottle of beer is pressed into my hand by some kid who doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m the designated driver. It\u2019s tempting, but I leave it unopened. I have a headache. Already. I cross my arms and stay on the lawn, bored. After a while, Anna, Kara, and Jeanette march up. \u201cAnyone need a ride home?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cParty\u2019s barely started,\u201d Anna says. \u201cWe\u2019re not over it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Marta? Is she over it yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrip Monopoly,\u201d Kara says.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2014\u201d Jeanette stumbles forward and relieves me of my beer. \u201cYou can\u2019t have this. You\u2019re the designated driver.\u201d She cracks it open and pounds it. For a second, I envy her. \u201cThis is the best party ever.\u201d</p><p>Anna rips the bottle from her hands. \u201cJesus, Jeanette. It\u2019s too early for you to be this wasted. If Regina has to drive you home before midnight, I\u2019ll kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask her. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d Anna takes a sip of the stolen beer. \u201cSo I want to keep you here as long as possible.\u201d</p><p>Jeanette reaches for the bottle. \u201cGive. Get your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKara, get me a beer out of the cooler,\u201d Anna says.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s around the other side of the house,\u201d Kara whines.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Get me one.\u201d</p><p>She goes. It\u2019s pathetic how she goes.</p><p>\u201cNailed Josh yet?\u201d I ask Anna.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you think I should go back there?\u201d I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cDo you think he\u2019d think I was needy? I didn\u2019t call him today or anything. If I went back there, do you think he\u2019d mind? I don\u2019t want to be overbearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201d You don\u2019t want to be overbearing?\u201d God, I wish I had a drink. \u201cThat\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should maybe try to get on my good side,\u201d she snaps. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be totally miserable for you all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never been anything but, Anna.\u201d I study her. \u201cSo you really like him, huh?\u201d</p><p>Of course she likes him. And the question throws her off, like I want it to. She opens her mouth and flushes, and it\u2019s these small things, these gives that Anna works hard to keep off her face that could be her downfall if anyone just looked closely enough.</p><p>But I was the only one who did.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asks. \u201cGoing to steal him back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d I say. \u201cWatch out.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a look like she can\u2019t stand being around me, and then she goes, which is totally great. I watch a group of sophomores force a poor frosh to take an impossible sip from a bottle of rye. Jeanette sucks on the beer. After a while, Kara returns with the one Anna sent her for.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did Anna go?\u201d she demands.</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>\u201cDid she say where she was going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she forgot about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Regina.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms and stare up at the sky. No stars. Nothing. \u201cI\u2019m still not sorry, Kara,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly why you\u2019re there,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Enjoy your moment. Doesn\u2019t that bother you? You\u2019ll probably go your whole life and it won\u2019t be this good again. You\u2019ve totally peaked.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s your moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t my moment,\u201d I tell her. \u201cThis is my penance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? For Liz? For Michael?\u201d</p><p>I bite the inside of my cheek. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it funny how you tried to get back in good with Michael and Liz, and it didn\u2019t work? I think that means if this is your penance for anything,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s your penance for what you did to me, and it will be until you\u2019re sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d give you that? After all this?\u201d</p><p>Her face turns red. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even have a good reason. You didn\u2019t even have one single good reason to treat me the way you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I needed one of those.\u201d</p><p>I leave her there. My stomach aches, aches, aches, and this is stupid. It\u2019s stupid because I\u2019m worried what Kara said is true. This is what I get until I pay up, but how can I have gone through everything I\u2019ve gone through and still not be paid up? Sorry, sorry, sorry. I never want to apologize to her. Ever. I hate that idea. Hate it. I make my way around the house and find Josh lurking beneath a tree in the backyard away from the party and the bonfire. Anna-less. He\u2019s nursing a bottle of Jack Daniels. He takes a swig and I try to pass him unnoticed, but he grabs my arm.</p><p>\u201cRegina, wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>I pull away from him. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly need a ride home.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything. We stare at each other. It\u2019s weird. I move to leave again, but he grabs me by the arm again. His hand stays on me this time.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He takes a long pull from the bottle. The party sounds fill the air. He shakes his head and bites his index finger before speaking. \u201cRegina, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d I step back, my heart sinking to my stomach. \u201cWho told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna was laughing about it with Kara,\u201d he says. \u201cShe said you said he tried to rape you.\u201d He looks away from me. \u201cThat\u2019s what you wanted to tell me that night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. I mean\u2014 fuck:\u2019 He takes another swig of the Jack. \u201cI can\u2019t fucking believe this. Fuck. I am so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChoke on it, Josh.\u201d</p><p>He flinches. \u201cSeriously\u2014don\u2019t. Like\u2014\u201d He twitches, like he can\u2019t stand himself, and I\u2019m glad, that makes me happy because he should know that feeling at least once. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about it. It changes everything\u2014it totally\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell Anna it\u2019s the truth?\u201d I ask. He looks away. No. He\u2019s not. \u201cThen it doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>He closes his eyes and leans back against the tree. This is what I wanted this whole time, and it doesn\u2019t change anything. No one will ever benefit from knowing this. It\u2019s now completely worthless information, designed to make people feel bad. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It still happened and it was horrible. But it\u2019s worthless.</p><p>I am so empty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he repeats.</p> <p>\u201cGot any Percocet? Or just Adderall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got everything.\u201d He takes another swig from the bottle and stares at me. I stare back at him expectantly. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d he says. \u201cYou want Percocet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll really fuck you up. It\u2019s not like you take them every day\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne night, Josh. If you\u2019re sorry, you\u2019ll give it to me.\u201d</p> <p>How can he refuse? He takes another drink, grabs my hand, and leads me around the edge of the house, unseen. We go upstairs, to his room. He digs into his sock drawer, and a second later I have the pills. Plural. He must feel really bad.</p><p>He must think they\u2019ll help.</p><p>\u201cOn the house,\u201d he says. \u201cUnless you want to pay me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeace offering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Like hell.</p> <p>\u201cRegina, I\u2019m really sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d I say tiredly.</p><p>I leave him in his bedroom and head to the bathroom, where I sit on the edge of the tub and stare at the Percocet. Is this what it was like for Liz? Trying to find a decent ending for herself in a bunch of pills? But I don\u2019t want to die.</p><p>I just don\u2019t want to be here. I never wanted to be here.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever been here.</p><p>There\u2019s something automatic and familiar about the Percocet. I didn\u2019t do pills at parties before. I just drank. Because it made it easier to be here, but\u2014</p><p>I catch sight of myself in the mirror. There are bags under my eyes and my face is pale and the corners of my mouth are edging down of their own accord. The pills feel heavy in my palm, as heavy as Donnie\u2019s keys in my palm. But that was different.</p><p>I curl my fingers around the pills and close my eyes. I want them. One. That\u2019s how I do these things. Coward. Liz is right. Coward. I want to be better than that someday. If it\u2019s possible. Is it possible. I hope....</p> <p>I open my hand. I flush them down the toilet.</p><p>I stay in the bathroom for an hour and then I decide I\u2019m leaving and I\u2019m not driving anyone home.</p><p>I\u2019m making my way out of the house when some sophomore corners me and tells me Bruce is looking for me because he needs a ride. I groan and modify my plans, because I don\u2019t want him to get in a car if he\u2019s totally plastered. I have to make him someone else\u2019s problem. I leave the house and make my way to the backyard, to the bonfire. Henry\u2019s lounging in a chair.</p><p>\u201cIs Josh here?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>Henry shrugs. \u201cHe was.\u201d</p><p>My eyes travel to an empty bottle of vodka lying on the ground. \u201cHenry,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s inside,\u201d he says, closing his eyes. And then a warning: \u201cAnna\u2019s probably close.\u201d</p><p>I go back inside and climb up the stairs. Maybe he\u2019s in his bedroom, but I hope not. If he\u2019s there, Anna\u2019s with him. I don\u2019t want to see them fucking.</p><p>Josh\u2019s bedroom door is open. No one\u2019s inside. I make my way back down the stairs, and a sliver of light filtering across the floor from inside the den catches my eye.</p><p>My last memories of the den aren\u2019t good.</p><p>But Donnie\u2019s not there.</p><p>I push the door open. Josh is sprawled on the couch, his right leg dangling off the side, his arm thrown haphazardly across his eyes. I cross the room and stand over him, and his glassy eyes take me in.</p><p>As soon as he registers my face, he struggles into a sitting position and pats the space next to him. I sit down.</p><p>He rubs his eyes. \u201cIs Anna back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe drove Jeanette home because she couldn\u2019t find you. She\u2019s very, very mad about that....\u201d</p><p>Good. \u201cI\u2019m going home. Tell Anna I went.\u201d Josh brings his hand up to my face. I brush it away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>His face falls, devastated, like it\u2019s some leftover from what happened with Donnie, even though it\u2019s more that I still hate Josh. He edges closer to me and says pathetically, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Regina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>It doesn\u2019t stop him. He wraps his arms around me, like that\u2019s sorry. Like it makes everything right, even though it\u2019s so far from ever being right again. He tightens his grip on me, like he\u2019s trying to get his apology into my bones, but it\u2019ll never work. And then he pulls away a little and holds my face in his hand and brings his mouth really close to mine. At first, I think he\u2019s going to kiss me, but he doesn\u2019t. He keeps his mouth close so he can apologize into mine. I can smell the booze on his breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he says, resting his forehead against mine. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Josh lowers his hands. I turn slowly. Kara\u2019s voice is soft and interested.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>She looks me over. \u201cWhat? Goddammit, you\u2019re the fucking designated driver, Regina. Who\u2019s going to drive Bruce home?\u201d I shrug. \u201cYou look pretty sober to me.\u201d And then she starts spluttering and I go home.</p><p>The plan: Get to school before everyone else and hide out in the library, because I\u2019m not looking forward to Anna today. She\u2019ll give me hell for bailing.</p><p>I leave the house while my parents are still asleep. The air is crisp. Each breath in stings a little, but it\u2019s sort of invigorating. A miniscule nice moment in a sea of feeling bad. I try to figure out a way I can hold on to that. I\u2019m holding on to it until Anna\u2019s Benz pulls up beside me, and then my moment goes away.</p><p>\u201cKara totally said you\u2019d try to get there before us,\u201d Anna says, leaning over Kara, who is in the passenger\u2019s side. Marta and Jeanette are in the back. \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegina, it\u2019s too early in the morning to threaten you with blackmail. Get in.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. Marta gets out of the car and waits for me to crawl in. As soon as we\u2019re all wedged side by side in the back, Anna U-turns. We\u2019re headed away from the school.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast. I\u2019m not going in this early.\u201d</p><p>I pop an antacid and rest my head against the seat, and they get fast food from the local strip. The car fills with that fatty, greasy smell and I try to tune out the chewing and talking, but it\u2019s impossible. I keep waiting for Anna to bitch me out for failing my duties last night, but it never happens, so I let myself relax a little and watch the road disappear under the space of windshield visible between her and Kara.</p><p>\u201cSo good,\u201d Jeanette says, popping the last of a greasy breakfast muffin into her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking hungover. I thought I was going to die last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you to pace yourself.\u201d Anna turns on the radio, settling on a station that will please her and none of us. \u201cThat reminds me. Thanks for fucking us over, Regina.\u201d</p><p>There it is. \u201cYou didn\u2019t really think I\u2019d stay, did you?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t say anything. I reach into my pocket for another antacid. Houses blur past the window. Anna drives aimlessly and turns the car onto a deserted stretch of road. I check the clock. We\u2019re going to be late.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be late if you don\u2019t turn around now,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cWho cares? It\u2019s Friday. Besides, I know you can\u2019t stand being around us, so I\u2019m just prolonging your torture,\u201d Anna says. \u201cThat\u2019s worth being late for.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and they start blathering\u2014going over the finer points of the party like they\u2019re worth going over\u2014while I focus on the radio. I don\u2019t even notice the car roll onto the shoulder until the keys jangle out of the ignition and kill the song that\u2019s playing.</p><p>We\u2019ve stopped.</p><p>All four doors open. I open my eyes. Jeanette and Marta get out of the car first, followed by Kara and Anna. I\u2019m in the backseat totally alone.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d Kara. \u201cGet out of the car, Regina.\u201d</p><p>The words come out honey-slow, oozing off her lips and into my ears. All at once, I understand what\u2019s happening. Drop and ditch. Bruce planted it into Anna\u2019s head when she was brainstorming ways to make Liz miserable, and I somehow managed to convince her it wasn\u2019t \u201ccerebral\u201d enough. She really wanted to do it, though.</p><p>And now she can.</p><p>I leave the car slowly, all too aware of how cold it is now that I know I\u2019m going to be stuck out here. I gauge the distance. Hallowell is a long walk back.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see this coming,\u201d I admit.</p><p>\u201cThat was the idea,\u201d Anna replies, standing behind Kara and looking strangely second in command. \u201cGive Kara your shoes.\u201d</p><p>Jeanette and Marta stand behind me like stone walls. Kara grins and holds out her hands, looking like she\u2019s got all the time in the world. In the grand scheme of things, this isn\u2019t that bad. It\u2019s not the WHORE spray-painted on my locker or another YourSpace page, and it\u2019s not being locked in a closet with Donnie Henderson. It\u2019s not losing Michael again. It\u2019s a long walk in sock feet when it\u2019s cold outside. It\u2019s a long walk in sock feet when it\u2019s cold outside without them.</p><p>So that\u2019s practically a vacation.</p><p>I crouch down, fumble with my shoes, take them off, and hand them over. My socks are thin and the ground is colder than the air. My toes curl in. Kara throws my shoes into the back of the car, yanks my book bag out, and tosses it onto the road.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says.</p><p>Marta and Jeanette grab my arms and force them behind my back. I try to jerk away before I really understand it, but they hold tight.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really fucked up this time, Regina,\u201d Kara sings.</p><p>\u201cJesus, are you kidding me? Because I decided I didn\u2019t want to drive you guys home?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s more like because you were all over Josh in the den last night,\u201d Anna says. \u201cKara told me she saw you together.\u201d</p><p>My jaw drops. Kara grins, daring me to deny it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it, Regina. Did you just give up? A final \u2018fuck you\u2019? You knew how I felt about\u2014\u201d She crosses her arms. \u201cYou knew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, resigned. \u201cI knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all you have to say?\u201d</p><p>I nod. Kara nudges Anna, who takes a few uncertain steps forward.</p><p>Kara nods at her encouragingly and says, \u201cJust don\u2019t forget to tuck your thumb in, okay? In.\u201d</p><p>Anna nods and brings her arm back.</p> <p>Oh, wait.</p><p>\u201cAnna, Anna, Anna\u2014Anna, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her fist connects awkwardly with my jaw, because Anna\u2019s never punched anyone before. She doesn\u2019t know how. Still, I\u2019ve been punched. My knees give a little at the shock of it, but Marta and Jeanette keep me upright. It\u2019s dead silence and then\u2014</p><p>Anna starts to laugh.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d she cries, clutching her hand. An achy warmth spreads across my jaw. No, not warmth. Pain. \u201cShit, you guys\u2014that kind of hurt! Shit.\u201d</p><p>Marta and Jeanette laugh with her. Kara grabs Anna\u2019s hand and runs her thumb over it, smiling. Anna keeps giggling, lost to the thrill of punching me in the face.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d Kara tells her. \u201cWant to go again?\u201d</p><p>Marta and Jeanette tighten their grip on my arms. They want her to. I can feel it. Anna rubs her wrists, chuckling, until she looks at me. My heart stops while she sizes me up. I don\u2019t want her to go again. She can only get better at this.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she finally says.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Kara says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got her. We can fuck her up. You can\u2019t just bring her out this far and punch her once. \u201c</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Kara,\u201d I say. Kara turns to me. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said \u2018Fuck off.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She walks over. \u201cYou know you have your arms held behind your back, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019ll never have this chance again,\u201d I say. \u201cRight?\u201d</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t even prep. She draws her arm back and her fist connects with my stomach, and she hits harder than Anna. I can see the hit. It\u2019s in front of me\u2014light, everywhere. If Jeanette and Marta weren\u2019t holding me up, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be on my ass. The lights fade and the scene comes back. Before I can get a handle on it, Kara drives her fist into my stomach again and I crumple, my eyes watering. Jeanette and Marta drop me, because even they aren\u2019t expecting that second hit.</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe. I put my hand to the pavement. Get up. Kara\u2019s foot connects with my abdomen. My insides explode, and then it happens again: She kicks me again. I gag. Anna makes noise somewhere nearby. Jeanette and Marta move away. Kara\u2019s foot goes for my shoulder, and my brain sends frantic messages to my body saying Get up, move, so I roll onto my side and cover my head, leaving my back exposed, which is exactly where she gets me next. Hard. I roll onto my back, gasping, drowning. Kara kneels over me and covers my face with her hand, presses her palm over my mouth, my nose.</p><p>Our eyes meet.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing between us.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>I claw at her arms, digging my nails into the bits of flesh her sweater doesn\u2019t cover. She winces and her hand is off my mouth. The air is razor sharp. I\u2019ve barely tasted it when she grabs me by the shoulders and forces me into the ground. My head hits the road. The ocean is in my ears.</p><p>My hands drop.</p><p>Kara straightens and gets one last kick in. My side. I go in on myself and the adrenaline leaves me again and again and again, leaves me with this unbearable clarity where I know my feet are cold and my body is screaming and I can\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cYou were just going to waste it,\u201d Kara yells at Anna. \u201cYou were just going to fucking waste it! That\u2019s what we came out here for!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Kara,\u201d Jeanette breathes. \u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d She shakes her hand, glaring at me. \u201cI\u2019m good now.\u201d</p><p>I listen to the gravel-crunch of footsteps making their way back to the car, car doors opening and closing shut, and then quiet, and I\u2019m alone.</p><p>\u201cGet up.\u201d I\u2019m not alone.</p><p>\u201cRegina, get up.\u201d No. Anna\u2019s breathing heavily, charged from the electricity of this. \u201cRegina, get up\u201d I don\u2019t say anything. \u201cI just want to know why,\u201d she says.</p><p>I roll onto my back and lick my lips. Dirty gray clouds move across the sky, white sunlight filtering in through the breaks. And the sky looks so great from here, I start to laugh. It hurts, but I do it anyway.</p><p>I laugh so hard I cry.</p><p>\u201cKara got you again\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did\u201d I say, laughing. \u201cShe totally did. She got you again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKara\u2019s not that smart.\u201d</p><p>It comes out of her mouth so vehemently, but so sincerely, I finally understand why I never, ever had a chance. \u201cYou\u2019re so stupid, Anna.\u201d</p><p>She moves her foot like she\u2019s going to kick me like Kara\u2019s kicked me, and the laughter dies instantly. I raise my hands and cover my face. Nothing happens. She savors this victory in quiet, until the car starts up and the horn blares.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s been really interesting, but I\u2019ve got to go,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know. Get destroying your boyfriend underway. Monday\u2019s going to be great. Have a nice walk.\u201d</p><p>Michael. She gets in the car and they head down the road. Michael. I curl into the ground until I can feel it\u2019s cold everywhere and I know I have to move. I push myself up on my elbows, my knees, Stand. Stand, Regina. It\u2019s easy. Stand.</p><p>You do it every day.</p><p>I walk the entire way back to Hallowell on feet so cold I don\u2019t even</p><p>notice when they step through broken glass, until my sock starts sticking to my heel and gravel starts sticking to my sock and I look down and there\u2019s blood. I don\u2019t know how long it takes me to get into town, but every second settles into my screaming bones. My stomach aches. My back aches. My jaw aches. My feet are numb. All I can think is Michael.</p><p>Michael. Michael. Michael. The thought of him drags me to Hallowell, drags me down the back streets, past my empty house, and all the way to the school, because I have to tell him. He has to know what\u2019s coming.</p><p>I limp across the parking lot and yank the front doors open. I step inside. The place is quiet. Distant class noises float down the hall\u2014the illusion of another ordinary day. The warm air levels me, makes me feel instantly stupid-headed and dull.</p><p>My stomach lurches.</p><p>I\u2019m going to be sick.</p><p>I fumble down the hall, keeping one hand against the wall and the other over my mouth, trying to make my way unobtrusively to the girls\u2019 room. I know I can\u2019t be seen.</p><p>After forever, the pale blue door reveals itself. I pull it open and stumble in.</p><p>Charie Andrews is standing at the mirrors, fussing with her hair.</p><p>She stops when she sees me. Her eyes go wide as saucers. I lean against the door and close my eyes for a minute.</p><p>When I open them, she\u2019s looking at my feet. I breathe in and walk stiffly over to the sink. I tell myself there\u2019s nothing here to look at. The smell of the soap makes me even more nauseous, and she\u2019s barely stepped away from me when I throw up\u2014nothing.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d she mutters. I spit and then I rest my palms on the sink and try to get my bearings. I end up with my forehead against the mirror, staring down the drain, vaguely realizing this is not acting like there\u2019s nothing to look at.</p><p>Get it together, Regina.</p><p>I take one deep breath and then another. On the walk back, I could do this. I could see myself doing this, but now I think maybe I need to sit down.</p><p>I sit on the floor, my back against the wall, and close my eyes, waiting for every broken part of me to piece itself together enough to tell Michael what\u2019s coming, and I feel Charie\u2019s eyes on me that whole time, and I don\u2019t even have the energy to tell her to go to hell. And then the washroom door swings shut and she\u2019s gone.</p><p>My toes are thawing, prickling uncomfortably. I open my eyes. I need to wedge the garbage can under the door so no one can come and see me like this. No one else. I press my palms against the floor and try to get to my feet and\u2014</p><p>I can\u2019t.</p><p>I move and every kicked part of me protests, so I wrap my arms around myself and listen to the slow, steady sound of the faucet dripping water into the sink, and it goes deep. For a second, I\u2019m in my bed again. This morning hasn\u2019t started.</p><p>Everything is...fine.</p><p>The washroom door flies open. My heart stops and my head jerks up. When my eyes focus on the halo of blond hair set around a pale face, I just\u2014Liz. Always here. No matter what I do, she\u2019s always going to be here. This suicide blonde, haunting me for the rest of my life, following me from one awful moment to the next.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she says. \u201cCharie said you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stops. We stare at each other, but I can\u2019t hold her gaze, and I feel her looking at me long after I look away. I lean my head against the wall and close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cRegina,\u201d Liz says sharply, like I\u2019m dying right in front of her. I open my eyes and laugh a little at that thought. I realize I\u2019m not cold anymore, I\u2019m warm. Hot. My shirt is clinging to every bit of skin there is to cling to. My hair is stuck to my neck and my face.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d I say. Wait. No. I need her. Take it back. \u201cGet Michael for me. I need to tell him something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to talk to you,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cLiz, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Frustrated tears spring to my eyes. \u201cFuck you, Liz. You don\u2019t even know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got your ass kicked,\u201d she says, \u201cfinally, and you want Michael to come pick up the pieces. I know what they did to you. I was in that stall\u2014\u201d She points. \u201cAnd Anna and Jeanette came in here, giggling about it. I knew you were out on that road.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stare at the floor. Tears spill out onto my cheeks. I wipe my eyes.</p><p>\u201cGod, Regina, I don\u2019t understand you. This is the only thing that could have happened. You think you\u2019re making easy choices, and every single time you have a good thing, you ruin it. Because you\u2019re a coward. Don\u2019t expect me to feel sorry for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you wanted me to have it,\u201d I snap. She snorts. I grab the edges of the counter and try to get myself up but I can\u2019t. And I can feel how pathetic it is and I know how pathetic it looks. I can\u2019t get up and she\u2019s just standing there. I slam my palm against the floor. \u201cWhy are you even here if you\u2019re not going to help?\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth drops open. She looks away from me, ashamed. I\u2019ve never seen that on her face before, and I don\u2019t even know how I managed it, until she says, \u201cI wanted to see it.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s such a bitch thing to say.</p><p>But I get it.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I mumble. I don\u2019t care anymore. I grab the counter a second time and finally manage to get to my feet. I lean on it. My mouth is dry, parched. I run the water cold and dab it on my face. It makes me painfully, painfully awake. \u201cIf you feel like it, tell Michael not to\u2014tell him not to come to school on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou tell me. You know everything.\u201d</p><p>I take a hard step on my right foot, the one with the cut, and wince. I just want to get past Liz, out of the washroom, go home, and die. She grabs my arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling him anything if you don\u2019t tell me why.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip. This is not about me and Liz. Michael.</p><p>\u201cThey have his journal,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Michael has his journal. I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head. \u201cThey stole it. Anna made photocopies and returned it before he knew it was missing. She\u2019s going to plaster it over school.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me. \u201cHe has his journal, Regina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the pages.\u201d My voice cracks. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you what they said. But there was something in there that could get him expelled\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be lying just to\u2014just to get me to feel sorry for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wrote that he wanted to kill everyone in school,\u201d I blurt out. Liz\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cThey\u2019re going to give it to Holt and say it\u2019s a death threat. Do you know what that could do to him? I don\u2019t lose anything if you don\u2019t tell him.\u201d</p><p>I push past her bony frame. The space between the stalls and the sinks is too narrow, and the corner of the counter rams into my kicked side. I make a dying-kitten kind of sound and curl in, one hand on my side, the other on the counter.</p> <p>\u201cRegina\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust look.\u201d I manage. \u201cYou wanted to see it.\u201d I leave the washroom and make my way down the empty hall. The bell rings at the exact same time I push back through the front door. My toes cringe at the reintroduction to the cold pavement. But this is nothing.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>I climb the stairs to my bedroom and study my reflection in the full -length mirror mounted on my closet. My jaw is tender to touch, but I think it\u2019s going to be okay, because Anna can\u2019t hit. But Kara can. I lift my shirt so I can see the damage. There are already bruises forming, abstract works of art across my abdomen and what I can glimpse of my back.</p><p>I raid the mirrored cabinet over the sink in the bathroom. My fingers travel over antacids and prescriptions until I find the Tylenol with Codeine and I take three of those, and then I crawl into bed.</p><p>Everything hurts.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to go to school today .</p><p>I get dressed slowly, but I don\u2019t want to look at myself. I don\u2019t want to see it on me.</p><p>Bruises always look the worst when they\u2019re healing.</p><p>I pull the edges of my sweater down and grab the bottle of Tylenol on my desk. I shake two pills into my palm. I probably don\u2019t need them. It doesn\u2019t even hurt like it did. Not totally. I take them anyway.</p><p>Mom and Dad drink their coffee at the kitchen table. Get ready for work. I stay at the kitchen sink, quiet, staring out the window. It\u2019s cold out. It looks cold out.</p><p>Anna\u2019s probably already taken care of it.</p><p>I wonder if it will be big.</p><p>I hope he\u2019s not there.</p><p>I turn away from the window and grab my book bag. \u201cBe careful in gym,\u201d Dad says, nodding at the bruise on my chin. He smiles a little. \u201cNext time dodge the ball, huh?\u201d I nod. Mom looks up from her coffee.</p><p>\u201cGoing in already?\u201d she asks. I nod again because I can\u2019t speak. She gives me a thumbs-up. \u201cThat\u2019s great. Have a good day, honey.\u201d</p><p>I count steps on the way to school\u2014283. School is 283 steps from my house.</p><p>When Hallowell High comes into view, I feel fourteen again. It\u2019s the first day of school and I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m standing in the middle of the parking lot. Anna bounds over to me and she\u2019s excited. It\u2019s the first day of school and she\u2019s a lowly frosh, but she\u2019s ready to take this whole place on. She claimed it as hers before anyone else got the chance, and we gave it to her because she was the only one who looked like she knew what she was doing, and I just went along with it because I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>I spot her Benz at the front of the school. They\u2019re here. I stalk across the pavement to the front doors. My pulse thrums in my ears, a prelude to a panic attack. I grip the door handle and pull it open. It\u2019s like my finger on the trigger.</p><p>My finger is on the trigger and\u2014</p><p>Bang.</p><p>The school is quiet. Distant ghost-footsteps reach my ears. I jog up the stairs to the lockers, and there\u2019s nothing. I expect journal pages taped to the walls, shoved in lockers, everywhere. But the school looks like it always does.</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s an illusion of peace. I hurry to my locker and spin the dial. Here. It has to be here. It\u2019s not just his torture; it\u2019s mine. It takes forever to get the right numbers, my hands are shaking so badly, but I finally get it and I pull the lock off and open my locker and\u2014</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>But she\u2019s here. I saw the Benz. They\u2019re here and they\u2019re early and they\u2019re ruining lives because that\u2019s what they\u2019d do. That\u2019s what she told me she was going to do.</p><p>I check the washroom. The empty changing room. The entire school is mine; it\u2019s so early, and I find nothing. How many ways can they do this?</p><p>I\u2019m not clever like Anna. I\u2019m missing something important.</p><p>The school begins to fill up. I listen to snatches of conversations, hoping for some indication, someone else finding it first, but there\u2019s nothing. I wander the halls. It gets busier, busier, busier. The busier it gets, the more bodies I have to contend with.</p><p>I glimpse Michael at his locker and he\u2019s okay.</p><p>I hide while he opens it up and wait for it\u2014 this, is it, this has to he it \u2014but nothing. Nothing happens. He just stands there, and this is any day. A normal day. He pauses, like he knows he\u2019s being watched. He does. He looks around. I back into the alcove and count to ninety, and when I look again, he\u2019s gone.</p><p>The bell rings. I stay in the alcove while the morning announcements start. If it hasn\u2019t happened by now, this is a slow build, a painfully slow build to it. Girl-bombs getting ready to go off and leave us all in pieces. I make my way down the hall and push through the door to the girls\u2019 washroom and Anna is there, staring at her reflection in the mirror. Her hands are on her makeup bag, but she\u2019s not moving. She\u2019s just staring at herself.</p><p>I back into the door, the handle jamming into purple-yellow-brown skin all over my back. I wince and turn, pulling the door open so I can leave.</p><p>\u201cCome to gloat?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I let the door handle slip from my grasp, but I keep my back to her and keep my mouth shut. I stare at the fading blue paint on the door, chipping around the edges.</p><p>Come to gloat?</p><p>I don\u2019t understand what that means. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>She turns her head and takes me in. Checks me, I know, for remnants of what happened last Friday, but there\u2019s nothing she can see from where she\u2019s standing and nothing I\u2019m willing to show her. Her eyes search mine, and then she laughs, softly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>What don\u2019t I know. She went straight to Holt. Michael will leave quietly and without a fight. That\u2019s not like her. Public humiliation is way more her style. She had a change of heart? I shake my head slowly.</p><p>I don\u2019t know.</p><p>She unzips her makeup bag and rummages through it, but her usual morning makeup routine seems lost to her. She starts with the lip gloss usually, but now it feels like she\u2019s just looking for something to do with her hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done with you. I\u2019m done with Michael. Your little friend, Liz\u2014\u201d She laughs and shakes her head. \u201cShe threatened to go to Holt about what I did to you. Hilarious.\u201d</p><p>The words settle in slow, twisting my stomach. I stare at Anna, my mouth trying to form a reply, but nothing comes out. I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cBut the photocopies\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz has them and I said I\u2019m done with you.\u201d She finally finds the gloss. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because -Liz won\u2019t go to Holt now doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI can still go to Holt. Show him the bruises.\u201d</p><p>She drops the gloss back in her bag and I notice she\u2019s trembling; she\u2019s afraid. She knows I could go to Holt and I\u2019d have her. I would have her.</p><p>But I want something better.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared,\u201d I tell her. Anna. Scared. She gives me a look that could kill. \u201cYou always said none of this matters, and you\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she says tightly. \u201cBut it\u2019s good practice.\u201d I have never hated anyone so much in my life. I never will again.</p><p>I pull the door open and step out into the hall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>I spend lunch outside, sitting on the front steps numb.
