According to this particular rumor, it was whispered that on the other side there was no hunger, no bloodlust, and no passion. Only an endless peace.</p><p>It was a myth that Nefri, as well as the Oracles that sat on the Commission (rulers of the demon world) were happy to encourage.</p><p>The truth of the Veil was far less romantic.</p><p>It was nothing more or less than a prison.</p> <p>A creation of the Oracles to contain an ancient mistake that could destroy them all . . .</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Viper\u2019s Vampire Club</p><p>On the banks of the Mississippi River south of Chicago</p><p>The music throbbed with a heavy, death metal bass that would have toppled the nearby buildings if the demon club hadn\u2019t been wrapped in spells of protection. The imp magic not only made the large building appear like an abandoned warehouse to the local humans of the small Midwest town, but it captured any sound.</p><p>A damned good thing since the blasting music wasn\u2019t the only noise that would freak out the mortal neighbors.</p> <p>Granted, the first floor looked normal enough. The vast lobby was decorated in a neoclassical style with floors made of polished wood and walls painted a pale green with silver engravings. Even the ceiling was covered with some fancy-assed painting of Apollo on his chariot dashing through the clouds.</p><p>Upstairs was the same. The private apartments were elegantly appointed and designed with comfort in mind for those guests willing to pay the exorbitant fees for a few hours of privacy.</p><p>But beyond the heavy double doors that led to the lower levels, all pretense of civilization came to an end.</p><p>Down in the darkness the demons were encouraged to come out and play with wild abandon.</p><p>And no one, absolutely no one, could play as rough and wild and downright nasty as demons.</p><p>Standing in the shadows, Santiago, a tall exquisitely handsome vampire with long raven hair, dark eyes, and distinctly Spanish features allowed his gaze to skim over his domain.</p><p>The circular room was the size of a large auditorium and made of black marble with a series of tiers that terraced downward. On each tier were a number of steel tables and stools that were bolted to the marble. Narrow staircases led to a pit built in the middle of the lowest floor and filled with sand.</p><p>The overhead chandeliers spilled small pools of light near the tables, while keeping enough darkness for those guests who preferred to remain concealed.</p> <p>Not that there was a need for secrecy in the club.</p><p>The crowd was made up of vamps, Weres, and fairies, along with several trolls, an orc, and the rare Sylvermysts (the dark fey who\u2019d recently revealed their presence in the world). They came to fight in the pit for a chance at fleeting glory. Or to indulge in the pleasures his various hosts and hostesses offered, whether it was feeding or sex.</p><p>None of them were known for their modesty. Especially when they were in the mood to celebrate.</p><p>Santiago grimaced, his frigid power lashing through the air to send several young Weres scurrying across the crowded room.</p><p>He understood their jubilation.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t everyday that an evil deity was destroyed, the hordes of hell turned away, and Armageddon adverted.</p><p>But after a month of enduring the endless happy, happy, joy, joy, his own mood was tilting toward homicidal. Well, perhaps it was more than just tilting, he grimly conceded as a tableful of trolls broke into a violent brawl, knocking each other over the railing and onto the Weres seated below.</p><p>The domino effect was instantaneous. With infuriated growls the Weres shifted, tearing into the trolls. At the same time the nearby Sylvermysts leaped into the growing fight, the herb scent of their blood swiftly filling the air.</p><p>Santiago\u2019s massive fangs ached with the need to join in the melee. Perhaps a good old-fashioned beat-down would ease his choking frustration.</p><p>Unfortunately, his clan chief, Viper, had trusted him to manage the popular club. Which meant no extracurricular bloodbaths. No matter what the temptation.</p><p>Buzz kill.</p><p>Watching his well-trained bouncers move to put an end to the fight, Santiago turned his head as the smell of blood was replaced by the rich aroma of plums.</p><p>His lips curled as the violence choking the air was abruptly replaced by a heated lust.</p><p>Understandable.</p><p>Tonya could make a man drool at a hundred paces.</p><p>Strikingly beautiful with pale skin and slanted emerald eyes, the imp could also claim perfect curves and a stunning mane of red hair. But Santiago hadn\u2019t chosen her as his most trusted assistant because of her outrageous sex appeal.</p><p>Like all imps, she possessed a talent for business and the ability to create powerful illusions. She could also hex objects, although Santiago made sure that particular talent was only used on the humans who patronized the tea shop next door. Most demons were immune to fey magic, but Tonya had royal blood and her powers were far more addictive than most.</p><p>His loyal customers would never return if they suspected he allowed them to be enthralled by the beautiful imp.</p><p>Wearing a silver dress that was designed to tempt rather than cover, she came to a halt at his side, a smile curving her lush lips even as her shrewd gaze monitored the hosts and hostesses that strolled through the room offering their services.</p><p>\u201cA nice crowd,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Santiago grimaced. Unlike his assistant, he was wearing plain black jeans and a dark T-shirt that clung to his wide chest. And, of course, he\u2019d accessorized the casual attire with a massive sword strapped to his back and a handgun holstered at his hip.</p><p>Never let it be said he went to a party underdressed.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Nice\u2019 isn\u2019t a word I\u2019d associate with this mob.\u201d</p><p>Tonya glanced toward the tribe of Sylvermysts who were reluctantly returning to their table. The warriors possessed the striking features of all fey with long hair in various shades of gold to chestnut. But their eyes blazed with a strange metallic sheen.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she purred. \u201cThere\u2019s one or two I\u2019d consider edible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour definition of edible is appallingly indiscriminate.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head to study him with an all-too-knowing gaze. \u201cYeah well, at least I haven\u2019t been neutered.\u201d</p><p>Santiago curled his hands into tight fists, fury jolting through him. Oh no, she didn\u2019t just go there. \u201cCareful, Tonya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you got laid?\u201d</p><p>The air temperature dropped by several degrees.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so not going to discuss this,\u201d he snarled, his voice pitched low enough it wouldn\u2019t carry. Despite the earsplitting music, there were demons present who could hear a freaking pin drop a mile away. \u201cEspecially not in front of an audience.\u201d</p><p>Foolishly ignoring his don\u2019t-fuck-with-me vibes, Tonya planted her hands on her full hips. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to discuss it in private, but you keep shutting me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s none of your damned business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is when your foul mood begins affecting the club.\u201d</p><p>His fangs throbbed. \u201cDon\u2019t press me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t, who will?\u201d The female refused to back down, the words she had clearly longed to fling at him for days at last bursting past her lips. \u201cYou prowl through the halls snapping at everyone who is stupid enough to cross your path. I\u2019ve had six waitresses and two bouncers quit in the past month.\u201d</p><p>His jaw hardened with a stubborn refusal to admit she was right. If he did . . .</p><p>Well, that would mean he\u2019d have to admit he had been neutered.</p><p>Not only sexually, although that was god-awful enough to admit. After all, he was a vampire. His appetite for sex was supposed to be insatiable.</p><p>But his general lust for life . . .</p><p>Suddenly his enjoyment of pursuing beautiful women and spending time with his clan brothers was replaced by a gnawing frustration. And his pride in running a club that was infamous throughout the demon world was replaced by an itch that he couldn\u2019t scratch.</p><p>It was something he was trying to ignore under the theory that it was like a bad hangover\u2014something you suffered through and forgot as soon as the next party came along.</p><p>\u201cHire more,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cEasy for you to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you know where the door\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done,\u201d she interrupted him.</p><p>His dark brows pulled together in a warning scowl. \u201cImp, you\u2019re pissing on my last nerve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s my point.\u201d She pointed a finger toward the belligerent crowd that continued to eyeball one another with the threat of violence. \u201cThis mood of yours is not only infecting the employees, but the patrons as well. Every night we\u2019re a breath away from a riot.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, folding his arms over his wide chest. \u201cI run a demon club that caters to blood, sex, and violence. What do you expect? Line dancing, gin fizzes, and karaoke?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe atmosphere is always aggressive, but in the past few weeks it\u2019s been explosive. We\u2019ve had more fights lately than we\u2019ve had in the past two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard the news? We\u2019re celebrating the defeat of the Dark Lord,\u201d he tried to bluster. \u201cA new beginning . . . blah, blah, blah.\u201d</p><p>Like a dog with a bone, Tonya refused to let it go. \u201cDoes that look like celebrating?\u201d Once again she stabbed her finger toward the seething crowd. \u201cYour frustration is contaminating everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Santiago couldn\u2019t argue. The club wasn\u2019t Disneyland, but it wasn\u2019t usually a bloodbath.</p><p>At least not unless you were stupid enough to join in the cage matches.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you suggesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have two options.\u201d Tonya offered a tight smile. \u201cGo kill something, or fuck it. Hell, do both.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cAre you offering?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would if I thought it would do any good,\u201d she admitted bluntly. \u201cAs it is . . .\u201d Her words trailed away as she gave a lift of her hand, gesturing toward a distant corner.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something more suitable to your current taste in females.\u201d</p><p>Santiago wasn\u2019t sure what he expected. Maybe twin imps. He\u2019d always had a weakness for matched sets. Twinning . . .</p><p>Or maybe a Harpy in heat.</p><p>Nothing was more certain to distract a man than a week of incessant, no-holds-barred, balls-aching sex.</p> <p>Instead a female vampire stepped from the shadows.</p><p>\u201cMierda,\u201d he hissed in shock.</p><p>Not because the woman was stunning. That was a given. All vampire females were drop-dead gorgeous.</p><p>But this one had an eerie familiarity with her long black hair and dark eyes, which contrasted so sharply with her pale skin.</p><p>Nefri.</p><p>No, not Nefri, a voice whispered in the back of his mind. Her face was more angular and the approaching female was lacking the regal aloofness that shrouded the real Nefri.</p><p>Not to mention a lack of kick-ass power that would have all of them reeling beneath the impact of her presence.</p><p>But she was close enough to make his gut twist into painful knots.</p> <p>\u201cWill she do?\u201d Tonya murmured.</p><p>\u201cGet rid of her,\u201d he commanded, his voice thick.</p><p>Tonya frowned in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet rid of her. Now!\u201d</p><p>Spinning on his heel, he headed toward the stairs leading out of the lower levels.</p><p>He had to get out.</p><p>\u201cSantiago,\u201d Tonya called behind him. \u201cGoddammit.\u201d</p><p>The crowd parted beneath the force of his icy power, most of them scrambling out of his way with a gratifying haste as he climbed the stairs and entered the lobby.</p><p>Not that he noticed.</p><p>He was way too busy convincing himself that his retreat was nothing more than anger at Tonya\u2019s interference.</p><p>As if he needed the fey prying into his sex life. She was supposed to be his assistant, not his pimp. If he wanted a damned female he could get one himself. Hell, he could get a dozen.</p><p>And not one of them would be some pitiful substitute for the aggravating, infuriating, impossible female who had simply abandoned him to return behind the Veil....</p><p>\u201cTrouble in paradise, mi amigo?\u201d</p><p>It was a testament to just how distracted he was that he was nearly across the marble floor of the lobby and he hadn\u2019t noticed the vampire standing near the door to his office.</p><p>Dios.</p><p>If he could miss the current Anasso (the ultimate King of All Vampires), then his head was truly up his ass.</p><p>Styx was a six-foot-five Aztec warrior dressed in black leather with a sword strapped to his back big enough to carve through a full-blooded troll. And of course, there was his massive power that pulsed through the air like sonic waves.</p><p>It would be easier, and certainly less dangerous, to overlook an erupting volcano.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he muttered, regarding his unexpected guest\u2019s bronzed face. His visage had been carved on lean, arrogant lines emphasized by his dark hair, which was pulled into a tight braid that fell nearly to the back of his knees. He didn\u2019t look like he was there to party. Which meant he wanted something from Santiago. Never a good thing. \u201cCould this night get any better?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Styx arched a dark brow. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Share the fact he was no better than a eunuch with his Anasso? He\u2019d rather be gutted.</p><p>And, speaking as someone who actually had been gutted, that was saying something.</p><p>\u201cI most emphatically do not,\u201d he rasped, shoving open the door to his office and leading his companion inside.</p><p>\u201cThank the gods.\u201d Styx crossed the slate gray carpet, perching on the corner of Santiago\u2019s heavy walnut desk. \u201cWhen I took the gig of Anasso I didn\u2019t know I had to become the Vampire Whisperer. I just wanted to poke things with my big sword.\u201d</p><p>Santiago veered past the wooden shelves that held the sort of high-tech surveillance equipment that only Homeland Security was supposed to know about, unlocking the door of the sidebar that was set beneath the French Impressionist paintings hung on the paneled walls.</p><p>\u201cI hope you didn\u2019t come here to poke anything with your sword,\u201d he said, pulling out a bottle of Comisario tequila.</p><p>\u201cActually, I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Santiago poured two healthy shots of the expensive liquor. The last time Styx had said those words the Dark Lord had been threatening to destroy the world and he\u2019d been teamed up with Nefri in an attempt to find the missing prophet. \u201cI thought we\u2019d gone beyond the sky-is-falling to yippee ki yay, everyone back to their neutral corners so we could pretend that we didn\u2019t nearly become dog food for the hordes of hell?\u201d</p><p>Styx hadn\u2019t become king just because he was baddest of all bad-asses. He was also frighteningly perceptive. Narrowing his eyes, he studied Santiago\u2019s bitter expression with a disturbing intensity.</p><p>\u201cDoes this have something to do with Nefri and her return to her clan?\u201d</p><p>Nope. Not discussing it.</p><p>Santiago jerkily moved to shove one of the glasses into Styx\u2019s hand. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Briefly distracted, the ancient vampire took a sip of the potent spirit, a faint smile curving his lips. \u201cFrom Viper\u2019s cellars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Styx\u2019s smile widened. Despite being predatory alphas, Styx and Viper, the clan chief of Chicago, had become trusted friends. It was almost as shocking as the fact that vampires and Weres had become allies. At least temporarily.</p><p>Which only proved the point that doomsday truly did make for strange bedfellows.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know you\u2019re enjoying his private stash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat he doesn\u2019t know . . .\u201d Santiago lifted his glass in a mocking toast before draining the tequila in one swallow. \u201cSalud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Styx murmured, setting aside his glass, \u201cmaybe I should try my hand at Dr. Phil.\u201d</p><p>Santiago poured himself another shot. \u201cYou said you needed my help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the plan, but you\u2019re in a dangerous mood, amigo. The kind of mood that gets good vampires dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Santiago drained the tequila, savoring the exquisite burn. \u201cTell me what you want from me.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause before the king at last reached to pull out a dagger that had been sheathed at his hip. \u201cDo you recognize this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDios.\u201d Santiago dropped his glass as he stared in shock at the ornamental silver blade that was shaped like a leaf with a leather pommel inset with tiny rubies. \u201cA pugio,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cDo you recognize it?\u201d</p><p>His short burst of humorless laughter filled the room. Hell yeah, he recognized it. He should. It belonged to his sire, Gaius, who had once been a Roman general.</p><p>Centuries ago he\u2019d watched in awe as Gaius had displayed the proper method of killing his prey with the dagger. What a fool he\u2019d been.</p><p>Of course, he wasn\u2019t entirely to blame. Like all foundlings, Santiago had awoken as a vampire without memory of his past and only a primitive instinct to survive. But unlike others, he hadn\u2019t been left to fend for himself. Oh no. Gaius had been there. Treating him like a son and training him to become his most trusted warrior.</p><p>But all that came to an end the night their clan was attacked. Santiago had been away from the lair, but he knew that Gaius had been forced to watch his beloved mate, Dara, burned at the stake. And lost in his grief, Gaius had retreated behind the Veil where he sought the peace it supposedly offered.</p><p>Of course, it had all been a load of horseshit.</p><p>Gaius had allowed himself to be swayed by the promise of the Dark Lord to return Dara, and he\u2019d gone behind the Veil to betray them all.</p><p>And as for Santiago . . .</p><p>He\u2019d been left behind to endure hell.</p><p>Realizing that Styx was studying him with an all too knowing gaze, Santiago slammed the door on his little walk down memory lane.</p><p>\u201cGaius,\u201d he said, his voice flat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I suspected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was it found?\u201d Santiago frowned as the Anasso hesitated. \u201cStyx?\u201d</p><p>Styx tossed the dagger on the desk. \u201cA witch by the name of Sally brought it to me,\u201d he at last revealed. \u201cShe claimed that she worked for Gaius.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe know he had a witch who helped him along with the curs.\u201d Santiago nodded his head toward the pugio. \u201cAnd that would seem to confirm she\u2019s speaking the truth. Gaius would never leave it lying around.\u201d He returned his gaze to Styx. \u201cWhat did she want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she had been using Gaius\u2019s lair in Louisiana to stay hidden in case she was being hunted for her worship of the Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore likely she knew that Gaius was dead and decided to help herself to his possessions.\u201d</p> <p>Again there was that odd hesitation and Santiago felt a chill of premonition inch down his spine.</p><p>Something was going on.</p><p>Something he wasn\u2019t going to like.</p><p>\u201cIf that was the case, then she was in for a disappointment,\u201d Styx said, his expression guarded.</p><p>\u201cDisappointment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe says that a week ago she returned to the lair to discover Gaius was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Santiago clenched his hands. This was supposed to be over, dammit. The Dark Lord was dead and so was the sire he\u2019d once considered his father. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Something that might have been sympathy flashed through Styx\u2019s eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t either, but Viper was convinced she was speaking the truth. At least, the truth as far as she knows it. It could be that she\u2019s being used as a pawn.\u201d</p><p>Santiago hissed. His clan chief possessed a talent for reading the souls of humans. If he said she was telling the truth then . . . dios.</p><p>\u201cI witnessed him coming through the rift with the Dark Lord, but how the hell did he survive the battle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, he only survived in part.\u201d</p> <p>Santiago struggled against the sensation he was standing on quicksand. \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis Sally said that Gaius was acting strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been acting strange for centuries,\u201d Santiago muttered. \u201cThe treacherous bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that he looked filthy and confused,\u201d Styx continued, his watchful gaze never wavering from Santiago\u2019s bitter expression. \u201cAnd she was certain he didn\u2019t recognize her.\u201d</p><p>Santiago frowned, more baffled by the claim that Gaius had been filthy than his supposed confusion. His sire had always been meticulous. And Santiago\u2019s brief glimpse of Gaius\u2019s lair beyond the Veil had only emphasized the elder vampire\u2019s OCD.</p><p>\u201cWas he injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to the witch, he looked like he was under a compulsion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible. Gaius is far too powerful to have his mind controlled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt depends on who is doing the controlling,\u201d Styx pointed out. \u201cSally also said that he was obviously trying to protect something or someone he had hidden in the house.\u201d</p><p>With a low curse Santiago shifted his gaze to make sure the door was closed. No need to cause a panic.</p><p>\u201cThe Dark Lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Styx gave a firm shake of his head. \u201cThe Oracles are certain the Dark Lord is well and truly dead.\u201d</p><p>Santiago\u2019s stab of relief was offset by Styx\u2019s grim expression. The Dark Lord might be dead, but Styx clearly was afraid something was controlling Gaius.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve spoken to the Oracles?\u201d</p><p>Styx grimaced. \u201cUnfortunately. Since my first thought was like yours, that he\u2019d managed to salvage some small part of the Dark Lord, I naturally went to the Commission with my fears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>The room suddenly filled with a power that made the lights flicker and the computer monitors shut down.</p><p>\u201cAnd they politely told me to mind my own business.\u201d</p><p>He gave a sharp laugh. How many times had Styx been told to mind his own business? Santiago was going with the number zero.</p><p>\u201cHow many did you kill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Styx\u2019s crushing power continued to throb through the room. \u201cMy temper is . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCataclysmic?\u201d Santiago helpfully offered.</p><p>\u201cHealthy,\u201d Styx corrected. \u201cBut, I\u2019m not suicidal.\u201d</p><p>That was true enough. The King of Vampires might approach diplomacy like a bull in a china shop, but he was too shrewd to confront the Commission head-on.</p><p>No. He wouldn\u2019t challenge the Oracles, but then again, Santiago didn\u2019t believe for a second he was going to sit back and meekly obey their command.</p><p>Obey and Styx shouldn\u2019t be used in the same sentence.</p><p>\u201cIf this is none of your business, why did you come to me?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause Gaius is one of mine, no matter what he\u2019s done,\u201d Styx said, his face as hard as granite. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s being controlled by something or someone, I want to know what the hell is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Oracles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat they don\u2019t know . . .\u201d Styx tossed Santiago\u2019s words back in his face.</p><p>Santiago narrowed his eyes. It was one thing to sneak a bottle of tequila from Viper\u2019s cellars and another to piss off the Oracles.</p><p>\u201cAnd you chose me because . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one capable of tracking Gaius.\u201d</p><p>Santiago shook his head. \u201cThe bastard did something to mask his scent along with our previous bonding. I don\u2019t have any better chance of finding him than you do.\u201d</p><p>Styx\u2019s smile sent a chill down Santiago\u2019s spine. \u201cI have full faith you\u2019ll find some way to hunt him down. And, of course, do it without drawing unnecessary attention.\u201d</p><p>Great.</p><p>Not only was he being sent on a wild goose chase, but he was in danger of attracting the lethal anger of the Oracles.</p><p>Just what he didn\u2019t need.</p><p>With his hands on his hips, Santiago glared at his companion. \u201cSo you\u2019re not willing to risk the wrath of the Commission, but you\u2019re willing to throw me under the bus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass.\u201d Styx allowed his power to slam into Santiago, making him grunt in pain. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to do this, then don\u2019t. I thought you would be eager for the opportunity to be reunited with your sire.\u201d</p><p>Santiago held up a hand in apology. Mierda. He truly was on the edge of sanity to deliberately goad the King of Vampires.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. And it was true. Styx was right. He\u2019d waited centuries for the opportunity to confront his sire. Now he\u2019d been given a second chance. Why wasn\u2019t he leaping at the opportunity? \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d He broke off with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He pulled out his cell phone, concentrating on what needed to be accomplished before he could head out. \u201cI need to contact Tonya to warn her she\u2019ll be in charge of the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at my lair in Chicago. Roke is keeping an eye on her in case this turns out to be a clever trick.\u201d</p><p>Santiago sent his companion a startled glance. Roke, the clan chief from Nevada, was in an even fouler mood than Santiago since Styx had refused his return to his clan after Cassandra had revealed that she\u2019d seen Roke in one of her visions.</p><p>\u201cThe poor witch,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s not a punishment I would wish on anyone.\u201d</p><p>Styx shrugged. \u201cHe was the only one available.\u201d</p><p>Santiago froze. \u201cIs there something going on that I should know about?\u201d</p><p>A strange expression tightened Styx\u2019s lean features. Was it . . . embarrassment?</p><p>\u201cDarcy insists that I devote my Ravens to trying to locate that damned gargoyle.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Santiago struggled to hide his sudden smile. The Ravens were Styx\u2019s private guards. The biggest, meanest vampires around. The fact he was being forced to use them to locate a three-foot gargoyle who\u2019d been a pain in Styx\u2019s ass for the past year must be driving him nuts.</p><p>\u201cLevet is still missing?\u201d he murmured. The tiny gargoyle had astonishingly played a major part in destroying the Dark Lord, but shortly after the battle he\u2019d disappeared into thin air. Quite literally.</p><p>\u201cYou find that amusing?\u201d Styx growled.</p><p>\u201cActually I find it a refreshing reminder of why I\u2019m happy to be a bachelor.\u201d</p><p>Styx\u2019s annoyance melted away as a disturbing smile touched his mouth. \u201cWho are you trying to convince?\u201d</p><p>Santiago frowned. \u201cConvince of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re happy?\u201d the older vampire clarified. \u201cFrom all reports you\u2019ve been storming around here, making life miserable for everyone since Nefri returned to her clan behind the Veil. That doesn\u2019t sound like a man who is content with his bachelor existence.\u201d</p><p>Damn Tonya and her big imp mouth. Shoving his phone back into his pocket, Santiago held out an impatient hand. \u201cDo you have directions to Gaius\u2019s lair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Handing over a folded piece of paper, Styx suddenly grabbed Santiago\u2019s wrist, his eyes glittering with warning. \u201cFor now all I want is information. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrystal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Oracles won\u2019t be happy if they find out you\u2019re trespassing in their playground,\u201d Styx warned. \u201cStay below the radar, amigo, and be careful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Santiago gave a slow nod. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>The Oracles\u2019 current lair</p> <p>Halfway between Chicago and St. Louis</p><p>Nefri made her return to the mortal world on a high bluff overlooking the Mississippi River.</p><p>She shivered, wrapping her long cape tight around her tall, slender body. Not from the cold, although the October night held a chill that had been absent during her last visit to this side of the Veil. But instead from the onslaught of sensations.</p><p>It was all so . . . overwhelming.</p><p>The scent of damp earth and the thick moss that edged the banks of the nearby river. The screech of an owl and the rustle of dead leaves. The feel of her long black hair stirring in the breeze.</p> <p>And, of course, the more intimate sensations.</p><p>Fear. Hunger.</p><p>Passion.</p><p>Standing perfectly still, Nefri smoothed her pale, oval face to an unreadable mask, a serene smile curving her lips and her ebony eyes revealing none of her inner turmoil.</p><p>Her considerable strength could overcome most dangers in this world, but the Commission was made up of the most powerful demons. They could eradicate her with a mere thought.</p><p>It was always like walking a tightrope when she was forced to meet with them. A tightrope that might snap at any second and plunge her to her death.</p> <p>At last prepared, Nefri stepped through the entrance of the caves that had been hidden behind a spell of illusion and moved to the center of the large chamber. On cue a Zalez demon appeared.</p><p>Just for a second there was the impression of a tall gaunt body with an overlarge head and tilted, almond-shaped eyes. Then the creature shifted into its human form, a Viking warrior with short, spiky blond hair and eyes the stormy blue of the Baltic Sea. His magnificent body was bronzed and fit for a god, which wasn\u2019t surprising considering he\u2019d been worshipped by more than one primitive society. At the moment that magnificent form was covered only by a pair of faded denims that hung low on his hips.</p><p>Nefri gave a small dip of her head, fiercely leashing her female reaction to the sexual pheromones released by the demon.</p><p>Zalez demons were part incubus and capable of becoming whatever form their companion most desired. Nefri had no desire to reveal her deepest fantasy.</p><p>Not after she\u2019d devoted the past month to pretending those fantasies didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cRecise,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cAh, Nefri, so good of you to come.\u201d His voice stroked over her like warm velvet, his smile charming despite the fact they both knew she hadn\u2019t had a choice.</p><p>An invitation from the Commission was an imperial command that only the most idiotic demon would ignore.</p> <p>\u201cYour messenger insisted that it was important,\u201d she said.</p><p>Recise gave a slow blink. \u201cThe Oracles do not interfere in matters of the world unless it is of the utmost importance.\u201d</p><p>Not boasting. Just simple arrogance.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>Moving with a fluid grace, Recise led Nefri through the darkness, the pulse of his sexual energy easing as if realizing Nefri wasn\u2019t in the mood to play.</p><p>They moved in silence through the tunnels that angled deep into the earth. The air was cool but surprisingly without the dampness that she expected, although she could hear the splash of a waterfall not far away.</p><p>More distantly she could catch the sound of muffled conversations, the languages as diverse as the creatures who made up the Commission. Like the United Nations, only with lethal demons who were happier killing things than negotiating.</p><p>Nefri hid her grimace as her companion came to a halt at the entrance to a large cavern.</p><p>\u201cThe Oracle is waiting for you in the back chamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She waited until the Zalez continued down the tunnel before stepping into the cavern and allowing her senses to flow outward. It wasn\u2019t that she expected a trap. If the Oracles wanted her dead, she\u2019d be dead.</p><p>But the Oracles had a varied sense of moral values. She didn\u2019t want to walk in on demons having a public orgy, or sacrificing an innocent to their particular gods.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she caught the scent of brimstone that she moved forward. She was familiar with this particular Oracle.</p><p>Crossing the smooth stone floor, she ignored the barren surroundings that were hardly suitable for the most powerful creatures on earth.</p><p>Each of the Oracles had their own private, and usually lavish lairs, but during the battle against the Dark Lord they\u2019d gathered together in these caves. The fact that they remained wasn\u2019t particularly reassuring.</p><p>Reaching the back of the cave, Nefri caught sight of the tiny demon who was staring into a shallow pool of water, her three-foot body covered by a long white gown.</p><p>At a glance it would be easy to mistake her for a human child, with her heart-shaped face and silver hair that was in a long braid nearly brushing the ground. But a closer look revealed the strange oblong eyes that were a solid black. Eyes that were filled with an ancient knowledge.</p><p>Oh, and then there were the sharp, pointed teeth.</p><p>And the barely leashed power that could shatter cities.</p><p>\u201cSiljar?\u201d she murmured when the female continued to gaze into the water, studying some image she\u2019d scryed.</p><p>With a wave of her hand, Siljar dismissed the image and heaved a heavy sigh. \u201cChildren today,\u201d she complained as she turned her attention toward Nefri.</p><p>\u201cI can return another time if you\u2019re busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is important.\u201d Siljar pointed a finger toward the lone wooden chair. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>Nefri obeyed without hesitation, perching on the edge of the chair and folding her hands in her lap.</p><p>\u201cDoes this have anything to do with the Dark Lord?\u201d</p><p>Siljar shook her head. \u201cNo, that chapter is closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank heavens,\u201d Nefri said in genuine relief.</p><p>Siljar held up a small hand. \u201cDo not be overly hasty.\u201d</p><p>Nefri\u2019s serene expression never faltered. It rarely did. She\u2019d had centuries of practice in hiding her emotions. To the point that many assumed she no longer possessed them.</p><p>Inside, however, a ball of dread was forming in the pit of her stomach. If new trouble was brewing there was no reason to specifically seek her assistance, unless . . .</p><p>\u201cThis has something to do with the Veil, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Siljar gave a slow dip of her head. \u201cIt has more to do with what the Veil was created to contain.\u201d</p><p>The ball in Nefri\u2019s stomach doubled in size. It had been nearly four centuries ago that she\u2019d approached the Commission asking for sanctuary and been given the medallion that allowed her to lead her clan beyond the Veil.</p><p>So far as the world was concerned her only interest was creating a new home for those vampires who sought absolute peace.</p><p>Only she and the Oracles knew the truth.</p><p>Or actually, only the Oracles knew the truth, she wryly conceded.</p><p>She had a few, bare-bones facts and dire warnings. And she\u2019d been fine with that. The less she knew, the easier it was for her to pretend that the paradise she\u2019d created wasn\u2019t built on a cesspit.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said.</p><p>Siljar paced to the ceramic pitcher set on a flat slab of rock. Pouring herself a glass of some golden liquid that smelled remarkably like Hennessy, she tossed it back like a seasoned drunk.</p><p>\u201cIt is suspected that Gaius came through the rift with the Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard rumors that he\u2019d been seen during the battle, but no one could say with any certainty what happened to him,\u201d Nefri said. \u201cI assumed he was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he was recently seen in the lair he used during his stay in this world.\u201d</p><p>Nefri\u2019s lips tightened. No one blamed her for Gaius\u2019s betrayal. Well, no one but the aggravating Santiago. He, of course, assumed she was to blame for every evil in the world. The annoying ass.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t help but regret the fact that she hadn\u2019t suspected there was more to Gaius\u2019s desire to become a part of her clan beyond his pretense of grieving for his dead mate.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe he intends to cause trouble?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot the vampire.\u201d</p><p>Nefri blinked. \u201cIs this a puzzle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA puzzle with too many pieces.\u201d</p><p>By all the gods, why couldn\u2019t Oracles just say what they wanted without all the mumbo jumbo?</p><p>\u201cWhy are you troubled by Gaius?\u201d Her tone was carefully bland. \u201cWithout the power of the Dark Lord he should be easy enough to defeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of this.\u201d Setting her empty glass on the flat stone, Siljar picked up a folded newspaper and handed it to Nefri.</p><p>She read the top of the front page. A small town newspaper from Louisiana? She continued to skim down to the lead headline.</p><p>\u201c\u2018An outbreak of violence in southern Louisiana\u2019?\u201d she quoted out loud before lifting her head to meet Siljar\u2019s piercing scrutiny. \u201cI assume this is somehow relevant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is where Gaius is hidden.\u201d</p><p>Nefri remained confused. \u201cYou think he\u2019s responsible for the violence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not entirely certain.\u201d There was a long pause, as if Siljar was holding a silent debate with herself. Then the tiny demon squared her shoulders. \u201cThis must stay between us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, those words were never good. Even worse, Siljar waved a hand to put up an invisible barrier so her words couldn\u2019t be overheard despite the fact they were sitting in the most highly secure spot in the entire universe.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have sensed the presence of an old enemy,\u201d Siljar confessed, her expression troubled. \u201cIt is very faint, but I . . . fear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn old enemy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one the Veil was created to keep from this world.\u201d</p><p>Nefri rose to her feet before she even knew she was moving. \u201cBut how is that possible?\u201d she demanded in shock.</p><p>\u201cIt is my suspicion that when the Dark Lord was destroyed it left Gaius stripped bare of all his defenses. He was dangerously vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he attempt to travel beyond the Veil?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, but he still possesses the medallion.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d been an unpleasant shock to everyone when it was discovered that Gaius had a medallion similar to her own. And that he\u2019d intended to use it to break the Dark Lord out of his prison.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, but I still don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Siljar lowered her gaze to the heavy gold medallion that hung around Nefri\u2019s neck. Scrolled with ancient spells, the medallion shimmered with a glow that had nothing to do with the torches set in the corners of the cavern.</p><p>\u201cThe ancient amulets were forged at the same time the Veil was created.\u201d Siljar folded her hands in front of her, giving the impression of a very small history professor. \u201cLong before you were asked to lead your people through the barrier.\u201d</p><p>Nefri stiffened in surprise. \u201cBut . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaius claimed his amulet was made by the Dark Lord,\u201d she explained.</p><p>Siljar snorted. \u201cPompous douche.\u201d</p><p>Nefri blinked. Pompous douche? Those weren\u2019t words she expected to hear from a mighty Oracle.</p><p>\u201cThe Dark Lord?\u201d she asked, cautiously.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Siljar peeled back her lips to reveal the razor sharp teeth. \u201cThe nasty creature was very skillful in destroying things, but he had no talent for creation.\u201d</p><p>Yes, that made sense. The Dark Lord had been worshipped as a god, but never as a creator. Something she should have realized herself, she acknowledged with a pang of annoyance.</p><p>\u201cThen how did he get it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe stole it during the time we were finishing the Veil.\u201d</p><p>Nefri\u2019s brows lifted at the reluctant confession. Stealing from the Oracles seemed . . . suicidal. \u201cHow was that possible?\u201d</p><p>Siljar shrugged. \u201cWe were distracted. Constructing the Veil took all our combined efforts and still we nearly failed. In fact . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact?\u201d</p><p>Siljar gave a sharp shake of her head. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Nefri knew damned well it wasn\u2019t \u201cnothing.\u201d But she also knew that \u201cnothing\u201d could force Siljar to share if she didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t the Dark Lord keep it?\u201d she instead demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe prophecy of his banishment had already been spoken,\u201d Siljar said. \u201cI think he hoped he would be able to reach the medallion from his prison and use it to bring an end to the dimensions between worlds. So he imbued it with his essence and hid it beyond the Veil.\u201d</p><p>Ah. It would, of course, be the perfect hiding place. Unfortunately for the Dark Lord, it was also the most difficult to penetrate.</p><p>\u201cSo when he couldn\u2019t reach it, he instead manipulated Gaius into stealing it for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And when the Dark Lord was destroyed the medallion was left empty, ready to be filled by another power.\u201d</p><p>Another power.</p><p>The power that was never spoken of.</p><p>The power that scared even the Oracles.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe simplest solution would be to question Gaius ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Nefri held up the newspaper. \u201cYou know where he is. Why don\u2019t you just go get him?\u201d</p><p>Siljar shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s why you were called.\u201d</p><p>Nefri frowned. \u201cYou requested I leave my people so I could travel to Louisiana and ask Gaius if his medallion has been hijacked by a strange spirit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Commission is . . . occupied with other matters at the moment.\u201d Siljar tilted her head, looking like an inquisitive bird. \u201cIf you hurry you should be able to tend to this task within a few nights.\u201d</p><p>Just . . . perfect.</p><p>Nefri hid her stab of annoyance. She didn\u2019t want to be in this world. Not when she was still raw and unsettled from her last visit.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t idiotic enough to be fooled by Siljar\u2019s polite pretense. This wasn\u2019t a request.</p><p>\u201cSo you just want me to question him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He must be brought to us. We will do the questioning.\u201d Nefri nodded. At least she didn\u2019t have to kill him. It was always difficult when she had to deal death to one of her clansmen.</p><p>\u201cI will do my best.\u201d</p><p>Siljar suddenly widened her eyes in a poor attempt at innocence and said, \u201cOh, perhaps I should warn you.\u201d</p><p>Nefri stilled, her predator instincts on full alert. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vampires know that Gaius survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Styx to keep his meddling nose out of Commission business.\u201d</p><p>She hid her hands behind her back so Siljar couldn\u2019t see she was clenching them in frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhich, of course, was the perfect guarantee to make sure he meddles,\u201d she murmured softly.</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>Nefri didn\u2019t miss the hint of satisfaction in her companion\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat is it that you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSiljar.\u201d</p><p>Intent on discovering what disaster she was being forced to walk into, Nefri nearly lost her legendary calm when two small shapes abruptly appeared directly beside her.</p><p>Good . . . lord. There\u2019d been no shift in air pressure that would warn of an opening portal, or a prickle of heat that usually went along with magic.</p><p>Just two creatures stepping out of thin air.</p><p>Taking an instinctive step back, Nefri assessed the danger of the intruders. One was obviously related to Siljar. Actually, she was nearly a replica with the same heart-shaped face and large black eyes. Only her hair was blond rather than silver and her eyes lacked the solemn wisdom of the Oracle.</p><p>Her companion, on the other hand, who was barely three feet tall, was obviously a gargoyle despite the fact he had large, gossamer wings that shimmered in shades of crimson and blue with gold veins. His features were suitably gargoyle-ish with gray eyes and a pair of stunted horns.</p><p>This had to be the infamous Levet, she silently acknowledged.</p><p>The gargoyle who\u2019d been vital in destroying the Dark Lord while she\u2019d been unconscious. Although at the moment he looked more like a petulant child, with his wings drooping and his tail twitching while the younger version of Siljar shook a finger in his face.</p><p>\u201cI told you that it\u2019s too soon for you to leave your bed,\u201d she chastised, clearly continuing a long-standing argument. \u201cMother, would you tell him?\u201d</p><p>The Oracle heaved the sort of sigh that could only come from a mother. \u201cYannah, how many times have I warned you not to interrupt when I have company?\u201d</p><p>So, this was Siljar\u2019s daughter, Nefri realized, her unease shifting to a wry amusement.</p><p>Yannah turned her head to glower at her mother, but her finger remained pointed in Levet\u2019s face. \u201cHe won\u2019t listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, dear, he is a male,\u201d Siljar soothed. \u201cThey rarely listen to good sense. It has something to do with their unbalanced hormones.\u201d</p><p>The gargoyle\u2019s long tail snapped at the insult. \u201cHey, I am standing right here.\u201d</p><p>Siljar sent him a confused glance. \u201cYes, I know. You are not invisible.\u201d</p><p>Levet sniffed. \u201cI am also not un b\u00e9b\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Yannah turned back, her hands planted on her hips. \u201cYou were nearly killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I am well.\u201d Levet lifted his hands. \u201cVoil\u00e0.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeak?\u201d The gargoyle went rigid, manly outrage tightening his ugly features. \u201cI have the strength of a . . . of a . . . very large and very dangerous demon. And my magic is formidable .\u201d He lifted his hands. \u201cShall I demonstrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Siljar and Yannah cried in unison.</p><p>\u201cFine, then stop saying that I am weak,\u201d Levet muttered.</p><p>Belatedly accepting that the tiny gargoyle possessed the same bullheaded temperament as every other male, Yannah allowed her lower lip to quiver. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just admit the truth?\u201d</p><p>Levet narrowed his eyes, clearly sensing he was about to be outmaneuvered. \u201cWhat truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re simply trying to get away from me.\u201d</p><p>He hunched a shoulder. \u201cAbsurd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not absurd.

Why did Styx and Santiago spend so much time complaining about the creature?</p><p>\u201cIt will be my greatest pleasure to assist you in your quest,\u201d he assured her. \u201cI did, after all, save the world from a certain apocalypse only weeks ago.\u201d He abruptly scowled, glancing toward the Oracle. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Siljar lifted her brows. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be another apocalypse, is there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDieu merci.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least not if we can prevent it,\u201d Siljar corrected herself.</p><p>Levet tossed his hands in the air. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Louisiana wetlands</p><p>Santiago wasn\u2019t the only predator to prowl through the cypress trees that were painted silver in the moonlight. Alligators, rattlesnakes, and occasional cougars hunted through the swamp along with the far more dangerous water sprites, who could lure a man to his doom, and a rare Dalini serpent, a demon who could transform from serpent form to look human. Always born male, they had to mate with mortal females.</p><p>Santiago was, however, the most lethal.</p><p>Moving with a grace that was impressive considering the spongy ground and thick undergrowth, Santiago slowly circled the isolated swamp, coming to an abrupt halt as a sensation he hadn\u2019t felt in centuries flared to life.</p><p>Dios.</p><p>It was his bond to Gaius.</p><p>Not all sires allowed a \u201cchild\u201d to form a physical attachment. In the good old days, most vampires rarely stuck around to find out if their creation actually survived the process of transformation, let alone continued to feed their offspring to give them the best possible chance for survival.</p><p>Gaius had gone a step further by taking Santiago into his clan and into his lair.</p><p>A true son.</p><p>The blood connection had given Santiago the ability to sense his sire. Or, if he was far away, to sense his general direction.</p><p>Santiago had assumed the bond had been destroyed when he traveled beyond the Veil. After all, he hadn\u2019t felt his sire for centuries, not even when he returned to this world. Now he could only wonder if the Dark Lord had somehow kept the older vampire from being discovered.</p><p>Holding perfectly still, Santiago allowed his powers to spread toward the distant house, built on brick stilts and painted white.</p><p>Large with two stories, it had black shutters and a screened-in porch that wrapped around the side. The roof had recently been replaced, but the nearby chicken coop looked like a stiff breeze might blow it over.</p><p>The structure was effectively hidden by the large trees draped in Spanish moss that surrounded it and was set far enough from the path leading to the nearby small town to avoid unwanted interest.</p><p>A perfect lair for a vampire seeking solitude.</p><p>Confident that nothing was creeping through the shadows beyond the native wildlife, Santiago focused his powers on the house.</p><p>It took only a second for a jolt of recognition to blaze through him.</p><p>Gaius wasn\u2019t there, but something else was.</p><p>Something powerful enough to make the very air sizzle.</p><p>So much for being the most lethal predator around, he conceded, his hands clenched as he was slammed by a combination of shock and dark, unwelcomed arousal. The Oracles had sent in the big guns.</p><p>Nefri.</p><p>No vampire beyond Styx had that kind of juice.</p><p>Certainly no other vampire could make him hard by her mere scent.</p><p>Jasmine.</p><p>Enticing, elusive, dangerous.</p><p>And his own personal kryptonite.</p><p>His spine stiffened as he moved forward, silently sliding through the front gate and up the wide staircase.</p><p>Not this time.</p><p>During their last encounter Nefri had managed to lead him by the nose and then dumped him like a bad habit.</p><p>Tonight she was going to discover that he wasn\u2019t her lap dog. In fact, he might just be her worst nightmare.</p><p>Entering the house, he glanced around the front room, which was filled with padded bamboo furniture. A frown touched his brow as he realized that the sofa and chairs had been shoved aside so a large circle could be scraped into the wooden floorboards.</p><p>The witch\u2019s work, no doubt.</p><p>Not that he gave a damn at the moment. His senses were filled with a beguiling jasmine scent that filtered deep into places that he\u2019d forgotten existed. Mierda. His entire body was resonating with awareness. As if Nefri had infected him with a brutal craving that only she could satisfy.</p><p>He should turn and walk away, a voice whispered in the back of his mind. A call to Styx for a replacement and he would be returning to his club to find a woman who could make him forget he\u2019d ever met a female named Nefri.</p><p>But of course he didn\u2019t.</p><p>His infamous talent for remaining in command no matter what the situation had been destroyed the moment he\u2019d realized that Nefri was within his grasp. Now he stalked forward, following the trail of his prey into the back kitchen.</p><p>Distantly he was aware of peeling linoleum, the ancient human appliances, and a small wooden table. But it was the female vampire standing in the center of the room that commanded his attention.</p><p>Regal.</p><p>There was no other word for Nefri\u2019s tall graceful beauty. Even surrounded by shabby white-painted cabinets and drenched in fluorescent light, she looked like a queen with her hair falling to her waist like a river of liquid ebony. Her face was a perfect, pale oval with features carved by the hands of angels and eyes dark and deep enough for a man to drown in.</p><p>Her lips . . . dios. How many fantasies had been devoted to imagining those cherry red lips wrapped around his cock? The same cock that was already standing at painful attention.</p><p>\u201cWell, well. Look what the cat dragged in,\u201d he drawled, moving to lean against the tiled countertop, his gaze narrowing as he took in the faded jeans that clung to her long, slender legs and the jade cashmere sweater that allowed him to appreciate the full curve of her breasts.</p><p>The last time she\u2019d left the Veil she\u2019d draped herself in long robes that only hinted at the feminine flawlessness beneath.</p><p>Now he felt as if he\u2019d just been punched in the gut. Trying to pretend a nonchalance he was far from feeling, Santiago folded his arms over his chest and met her piercing gaze.</p><p>\u201cSantiago,\u201d she murmured, taking a brief inventory of his own jeans, gray hoodie, and big-ass sword strapped to his back, her aloof composure rousing his most primitive instincts.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t look so cold and untouchable once he had her tumbled into his bed, he silently swore. She would be warm and willing and wild enough to sate his hunger.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t accept anything less.</p><p>He smiled, not bothering to hide his raw desire. Hell, she already thought he was a barbarian. No need to disappoint her.</p><p>\u201cI thought you had scurried back behind the Veil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScurried?\u201d A slow lift of her brow. \u201cI returned to my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout so much as a good-bye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy people needed me.\u201d</p><p>Bull. Shit.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt was difficult for us to accept that we could have a traitor living among us and not have suspected the truth.\u201d</p><p>Now that he believed her. Immortal Ones were arrogant enough to assume that they couldn\u2019t be deceived. Their pride must have taken quite a beating for them to accept they\u2019d harbored the traitor.</p><p>Still, he knew it was more than concern for her clan that had made her disappear without warning.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were running away?\u201d</p><p>A cool smile of disdain. \u201cRunning away from what?\u201d</p><p>He was lunging forward before he even realized he was moving, grasping her by the shoulders, swooping down his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis,\u201d he muttered as he kissed her with all the frustration that had plagued him over the past month.</p><p>For a shocking minute Nefri went rigid beneath his hands, and Santiago felt a cold shard of fear pierce his heart. He couldn\u2019t be wrong. Beneath all her ice, this female burned with an awareness that was as fierce as his.</p><p>Then, as his kiss gentled with a gut-aching need to taste her response, he felt a revealing quiver. It was faint, but unmistakable as she swayed toward him, her lips softening in invitation.</p> <p>S\u00ed.</p><p>Relief combined with a dark, intoxicating need threaded through Santiago. The scent of jasmine teased at his nose, the cool silk of her lips as potent as the finest aphrodisiac.</p><p>But before he could wrap her slender body in his arms and quench the lust that had raged through him for weeks, Nefri was lifting her hands and pushing them against his chest.</p><p>Grudgingly Santiago lifted his head to study her pale face with a brooding gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t expect an apology,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>The dark eyes flashed with an indefinable emotion before they were once again calm pools of ebony. \u201cYou are . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncivilized.\u201d</p><p>His hands trailed up her arms, luxuriating in the soft caress of cashmere beneath his fingers. He was a tactile vampire who took intense pleasure in touching and being touched. It had been far too long since he\u2019d indulged his senses.</p><p>All his senses.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he demanded, not even randomly offended by her accusation. \u201cBecause I haven\u2019t been neutered like those so-called Immortal Ones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy clansmen aren\u2019t neutered,\u201d she denied, a faint accent threaded through her low, enticing voice. Like many ancient vampires she deliberately cultivated the current slang, but often slipped into a more formal speech pattern when she was distracted. \u201cIn fact, they happen to be extremely intelligent, thoughtful, articulate. . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEunuchs.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned. \u201cI may have left this world a few centuries ago, but I\u2019m fairly certain that men are no longer allowed to maul women whenever they feel the impulse.\u201d</p><p>His soft chuckle filled the room. \u201cOh, I haven\u2019t even started my mauling,\u201d he assured her. He wasn\u2019t stupid. This female had the power to crush him into little squishy bits if she was truly offended by his behavior. \u201cThis is only a small taste of my pre-maul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSavage.\u201d</p><p>He placed a kiss on the tip of her proud, aquiline nose. \u201cAnd loving every minute of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d This time she pressed against his chest with enough force to assure Santiago she wasn\u2019t teasing.</p><p>Reluctantly he dropped his hands and took a step back. \u201cNot nearly, but it will have to wait for a more appropriate time and place.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin, looking untouched. Only the faint tremble of her fingers as she adjusted the heavy gold medallion around her neck assured Santiago he hadn\u2019t imagined her reaction to his kiss.</p> <p>\u201cYou actually have the word \u2018appropriate\u2019 in your vocabulary?\u201d</p><p>Aggravated by her calm while he was being seared alive with hunger, Santiago planted his fists on his hips. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Unfazed by the abrupt question, she met his gaze squarely. \u201cI could ask the same of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Gaius\u2019s only living child,\u201d he said without missing a beat. \u201cBy rights I can claim his property after his death.\u201d He ran an intimate glance up and down the stately length of her body. \u201cIn fact, by law anything or anyone attached to that property is mine.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his insinuation, regarding him with a cool disbelief. \u201cSo you\u2019re just here to inspect your latest acquisition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I leave it empty too long who knows what nefarious creature might decide to poach on my territory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.

She wasn\u2019t disappearing on him. Not again. \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor do I intend to.\u201d</p><p>He studied her pale, exquisite features. \u201cSuch a perfect ice queen,\u201d he murmured, his gaze lowering to the lush fullness of her lips. Those weren\u2019t the lips of an ice princess. They spoke to him of hot Spanish nights and decadent pleasure. \u201cDid the Oracles send you?\u201d</p><p>It was only because he was touching her that he felt her stiffen at his question.</p><p>\u201cOnly a fool discusses Commission business.\u201d</p><p>No shit. Unfortunately, Styx had tossed him straight into the lion\u2019s den. He needed to know why the Oracles were interested in Gaius. And what they were trying to hide from the vampires.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here looking for Gaius, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I?\u201d Frost coated her words. \u201cI was told that Gaius died during the battle against the Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>His short laugh held an edge of bitterness. \u201cYeah, a lot of us were told that.\u201d</p><p>Just for a second he thought he could glimpse something flash through her dark eyes. Sympathy? He shook his head. Not freaking likely.</p><p>The female was in pure ice mode.</p><p>\u201cAnd since you\u2019re here to claim your inheritance, it would be a wasted effort to search for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf truths and evasion, Nefri?\u201d He leaned forward, drawing deeply of her jasmine scent. \u201cThat isn\u2019t your usual style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing about me.\u201d</p><p>A smile curved his lips as he felt her faint tremor. Not fear. Nefri was a woman who was beyond fear of anything. Or anyone.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t fear. But need.</p><p>\u201cI know more than you ever wanted me to,\u201d his voice lowered, his fingers stroking up the back of her arm to her shoulder. \u201cWhich is why you bolted behind the safety of your Veil.\u201d</p><p>Her extravagantly long lashes lowered to hide her eyes, but it was too late.</p><p>They both knew she was vulnerable to his touch, even if she would rather have her tongue cut out than to admit the truth.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she jerked from his grasp, her steps measured as she headed toward the door.</p><p>Santiago let her take several steps, keeping his hands at his side. He had an ace up his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cHe was here, but he left,\u201d he said softly. \u201cOne, maybe two nights ago.\u201d</p><p>Nefri froze, her back held ramrod straight, before she slowly forced herself to turn and meet his mocking gaze.</p><p>\u201cGaius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes narrowed and Santiago knew she was weighing her desire to keep walking against her mysterious duty to the Oracles.</p><p>In the end there really was no choice.</p><p>For either of them.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d She at last forced the question past her stiff lips.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my sire.\u201d</p><p>She studied him a long moment. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t sense him before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he instantly agreed. Did she think he was lying? \u201cThere was something blocking our bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt didn\u2019t kick in until I reached this lair, but now I can feel him, although it\u2019s still muted.\u201d</p><p>Her dark brows drew together. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Santiago moved to stand directly before her, obsessed by the need to keep her close.</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019m 100 percent certain you know a hell of a lot more about what\u2019s going on,\u201d he drawled, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you explain it to me?\u201d</p><p>She took a deliberate step backward. \u201cI have no information.\u201d</p><p>Step forward. \u201cNefri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you sense him?\u201d</p><p>Her slender fingers lifted to touch the medallion, her jaw tightening. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He reached out to capture her fingers, which still clutched the medallion like a lifeline, his knuckles resting against the soft curve of her breast. \u201cCan you catch his scent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lack of manners is only exceeded by your complete arrogance.\u201d</p><p>A wicked smile curved his lips at her icy rebuttal. \u201cOh no, cara, the rules of the game have changed.\u201d</p><p>She tensed. One predator sensing another. Not that she was going to concede defeat. Not without a fight. Good. Strong women were so damned sexy.</p><p>\u201cWhat game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time you called the shots, this time\u2014\u201d His words broke off as he caught the unmistakable scent of granite approaching the back steps.</p><p>No. Oh no. Fate couldn\u2019t be that cruel.</p><p>But it seemed it was.</p><p>Even as he turned, the door leading to the bog of a backyard was being shoved open and a tiny gargoyle waddled into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDid something die in here?\u201d the creature muttered, his ridiculous wings twitching. \u201cI smell\u201d\u2014he came to a halt, regarding Santiago with a sour smile\u2014\u201cvampire.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSanta madre.\u201d Santiago turned back to glare at his beautiful companion. \u201cHave you gone completely loco?\u201d</p><p>Yes, Nefri silently answered the question.</p><p>In this moment she was fairly confident that she was at least skirting the edges of becoming loco.

As if ticking off the Oracles wasn\u2019t reason enough.</p><p>At least her inner turmoil wasn\u2019t visible as she met Santiago\u2019s searing black gaze. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d she asked in the cool tones she knew set his fangs on edge.</p><p>He pointed a finger toward Levet. \u201cWhy are you traveling with that pest?\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her gaze. \u201cPlease do not insult my companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui, do not insult her companion,\u201d Levet muttered, moving to stand at her side with an offended sniff. \u201cIn case you missed the mammogram, I\u2019m a hero.\u201d</p><p>Santiago scowled. \u201cMammogram?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMemo,\u201d Nefri corrected him. \u201cMissed the memo.\u201d</p><p>The exasperated male gave a shake of his head. \u201cAre you being punished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d She allowed her gaze to flick over his lean, muscular form, shown to perfection in his tight jeans. \u201cUntil now.\u201d</p><p>Santiago muttered a curse. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for him to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your call.\u201d She nodded toward the nearby doorway. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse us, I need to speak with Levet in private.\u201d</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be that easy.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking for your permission.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t follow Gaius\u2019s trail.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned as she realized he\u2019d so easily read her mind, but with a grim hold on her composure she turned her attention to the gargoyle as he stuck his tongue toward Santiago.</p><p>\u201cFor your information, I am a superb tracker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you find him?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cGiven time,\u201d Levet assured her, then with obvious embarrassment, wrinkled his ugly little snout. \u201cWell, perhaps it will be more difficult than usual. The vampire somehow managed to have his . . . essence stripped. There\u2019s no scent to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, you see,\u201d Santiago mocked.</p><p>She turned back with a lift of her brow. \u201cSee what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need me.\u201d</p><p>Oh . . . damn. She did.</p><p>Even the Oracles would agree there was nothing more vital than finding Gaius. And more importantly, what was currently controlling him.</p><p>Of course, she had to be sure that he could actually produce results before she agreed to anything.</p><p>\u201cHow do I know this is not a trick?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He scowled, as if offended by her question. \u201cWhy would I want to trick you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour male pride was obviously wounded by my return to my people without first gaining your approval.\u201d</p><p>His lips curled back to expose his fangs. Like all males, he didn\u2019t want to admit he might be unreasonable. \u201cI\u2019ll admit your disappearance annoyed me, but not because of my pride.\u201d He deliberately paused. \u201cIt was the coward\u2019s choice.\u201d</p><p>A dangerous silence filled the kitchen, broken only by Levet\u2019s gasp of shock.</p><p>\u201cI . . . umm . . . I think I will go investigate the upstairs,\u201d the tiny gargoyle muttered, his tail twitching as he hurried out of the kitchen.</p><p>Nefri and Santiago ignored his abrupt departure, both busy glaring at one another.</p><p>At last, Nefri found her voice. \u201cDid you just call me a coward?\u201d</p><p>Santiago didn\u2019t so much as flinch at the lethal edge in her voice. Something she might have admired if she hadn\u2019t been so infuriated.</p><p>\u201cI said you made a coward\u2019s choice,\u201d he corrected her.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever consider for one minute that my decision to leave had nothing to do with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I have duties that are more important than appeasing your ego?\u201d she grimly continued.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Santiago bit off his words, hissing as the sharp stench of rotting flesh filled the air.</p><p>\u201cSacrebleu,\u201d Levet called from above them. \u201cYou will want to see this.\u201d</p><p>Santiago rolled his eyes heavenward. \u201cDamn that gargoyle.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Styx\u2019s lair north of Chicago</p><p>The vast mansion on the north side of Chicago looked more like a palace than a lair for one of the most powerful and feared vampires in the world.</p><p>There were acres of marble floors, sweeping staircases, and lofted ceilings that were painted with museum-grade artwork. The hallways were lined with fluted columns and shallow alcoves that held Grecian statues. The furnishings were straight out of Versailles and there was enough gilding to make a sensible demon shudder in horror.</p><p>The lower dungeons, however, were straight out of the Pentagon\u2019s wet dreams.</p><p>Dug deep beneath the mansion, the spiderweb of cement corridors led to a variety of cells. Some lined with lead, others with steel, and still others with silver. And all of them heavily hexed to prevent even a spark of magic.</p><p>Which was a true pain in the ass for Sally Grace.</p><p>Standing in the center of the cell, the powerful witch considered all the bad decisions that had led to this particular moment. There were a number of them.</p><p>The decision to run instead of trying to kill her crazy-ass mother.</p><p>The decision to give in to the Dark Lord\u2019s promises of power in return for becoming his servant.</p><p>The decision to help the vampire Gaius and his idiot cur partners in their attempts to capture the prophet and her Were protector.</p><p>All bad.</p><p>But nothing topped her latest.</p><p>Why the hell had she ever thought it would be a good idea to approach the King of Vampires?</p><p>Only a month ago she would have laughed at anyone who suggested she would be seeking out the Anasso. She was, after all, determined to lay low now the Dark Lord was dead and forget she knew anything about demons or witches or evil deities. In a few years she could change her name and start over. Only this time she intended to stay strictly among humans.</p><p>With that in mind she\u2019d washed the black dye from her shoulder-length hair to reveal the deep red tresses streaked with gold that nature had intended for her. Her pale, almost fragile features were no longer marred with piercings or the black, goth makeup she\u2019d used to disguise herself. In fact, her big brown eyes and full lips were devoid of cosmetics. Even her love for short skirts and barely there tops had been replaced by jeans and sweatshirts.</p><p>Then she\u2019d disappeared into Gaius\u2019s home in the Louisiana swamps. Why not? There were few places more isolated, and it wasn\u2019t as if the vampire would need the place. Not after he\u2019d been killed in the battle with the Dark Lord.</p><p>Everything should have been perfect.</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t perfect.</p><p>A week ago she\u2019d returned to the house after a quick visit to the nearest grocery store to find that not only was Gaius alive, but he\u2019d become a mindless, feral animal who was obviously protecting something or someone in the house.</p><p>Terrified by the vampire\u2019s strange behavior, not to mention wanting him out of the house she\u2019d claimed for herself, she\u2019d retreated into the swamps and prepared a repulsion spell that should have worked on even the most powerful vampire.</p><p>She might hate her mother, but the bitch had trained her to brew some wicked black magic.</p><p>But once the spell was prepared and she\u2019d crept back to the house to cast it during the power of the full moon, she\u2019d discovered the house was being protected by a force that went beyond anything she\u2019d felt before.</p><p>And that was saying something for a witch who\u2019d been in the employ of an evil god.</p><p>Realizing there was something seriously weird going on, she had impulsively driven to this lair and demanded an audience with Styx. It was worth a try.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d expected, but it hadn\u2019t been for the powerful, lethally beautiful vampire to invite her into his private study where another vampire with long, silver hair and the face of a fallen angel had been standing in the corner. She\u2019d somehow assumed she would be handed off to a flunky to deal with her concerns. But instead the two powerful demons had listened to her claims with a convincing display of interest.</p><p>Styx had murmured all the right words and even offered her a cup of her favorite tea. And she\u2019d fallen for his faux sincerity hook, line, and sinker. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome into the parlor, said the spider to the fly. . . .\u201d</p><p>Sipping her tea, she\u2019d been in the middle of telling him precisely why Gaius had to be captured when she\u2019d felt her tongue go thick and her eyes drift shut.</p><p>Drugged.</p><p>The coldhearted, treacherous jackasses.</p> <p>She\u2019d woken only a few minutes ago, her tongue coated in fuzz and her magic muted by the hexes scrawled on the silver walls.</p><p>She did have her secret weapon, but it was a talent that only worked on humans, never demons. Or at least it hadn\u2019t until a few weeks ago when she\u2019d accidentally used it on a hellhound who had strayed too close to the house.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if her connection to the Dark Lord had muted her natural talents, or if she\u2019d reached some critical age where it finally blossomed. More likely the hellhound had been weak and she\u2019d been pumped up on adrenaline when it had suddenly appeared on her porch.</p><p>In any case, she\u2019d have to be an idiot to try it on a vampire or even a pure-blooded Were.</p><p>If she failed and they realized what she\u2019d tried to do . . . Well, being tossed in a cell would be the least of her worries.</p> <p>Damn Styx and his leech squad. She hated this feeling of helplessness. She\u2019d promised in the past that she would never again allow herself to be at the mercy of others.</p><p>Why else would she have agreed to worship the Dark Lord? Or partnered with Gaius?</p><p>Now she was back to the beginning.</p><p>Prey.</p><p>No. With a fierce effort she shook off the rising tide of panic. She wasn\u2019t prey. Never again.</p><p>Turning toward the camera hidden in the corner of the cell, she waved her arms. \u201cHeeeellllooo. Can anyone hear me?\u201d she screamed, knowing the vampire monitoring the cameras would be flinching at her shrill voice. Super hearing could be a bitch. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you freaks? I came here to help you.\u201d She stepped closer to the camera, her voice raising another painful octave. \u201cI risked everything to just try to warn you about Gaius. And what do I get? A reward? An \u2018atta girl\u2019? Hell, no. I get locked up like a rat in a cage. Thankless bastards.\u201d</p> <p>A second later she heard the sound of a distant door opening and closing, then the soft whisper of approaching footsteps. Instinctively she turned toward the bars of her cell, denying the urge to back into the distant corner as a cold, sharp-edged power filled the air.</p><p>Vampires thrived on fear. It was an aphrodisiac to the bloodsuckers. She wasn\u2019t going to give them the satisfaction.</p><p>The brave thought had barely passed through her mind when it tumbled into an abyss of shock at the sight of the male who stepped into view.</p><p>And despite being a dreaded leech, he was a male with a capital M.</p><p>Wearing jeans, a leather jacket over his T-shirt, and moccasin boots that reached his knees, he had the hard, lean body of a predator. His skin was bronzed and his dark hair brushed his broad shoulders. His features were lean with the high cheekbones of his Native American bloodlines and a proud nose. His brow was wide and his lips cut on sensual lines.</p><p>But it was his eyes that made her forget how to breathe.</p><p>They were . . . astonishing.</p><p>In the overhead light they glinted with a silver sheen, but they were so pale they appeared almost white, the shocking paleness emphasized by the rim of pure black that circled them.</p> <p>She shivered, feeling as if he could see through every layer of defense she\u2019d wrapped around her vulnerable heart.</p><p>Halting close to the bars of her cell, the stranger folded his arms over his chest and regarded her with a mocking smile. \u201cDid you learn such language from your mother?\u201d</p><p>The edge of disdain in his voice effectively squashed her unwelcome fascination. Jerk. What right did he have to look at her as if she were something he scraped off the bottom of his moccasin?</p><p>\u201cMy mother was too busy trying to kill me to teach me anything beyond how to run. Really, really fast,\u201d she mocked in return, moving forward to grasp the bars. As if her knees weren\u2019t trembling and her heart wasn\u2019t slamming against her ribs. \u201cAnd, oh yeah, never to trust anyone. Something I was stupid enough to forget.\u201d</p><p>The astonishing eyes widened, as if she\u2019d truly managed to surprise him.</p><p>\u201cYour mother tried to kill you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. Families. What\u2019cha gonna do?</p><p>\u201cWhy was I drugged and thrown in the dungeons?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI came here in good faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have only your word on that.\u201d He planted his hands on his hips, his jacket shifting to reveal the dagger attached to his belt and the gun holstered at his side.</p><p>Holy crap. He had enough firepower to bring down a rabid troll. She didn\u2019t know whether to be flattered or horrified. In the end she was just pissed off.</p><p>\u201cAnd a witch\u2019s word can\u2019t be trusted?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou admitted you worshipped the Dark Lord,\u201d he said without apology. \u201cThat hardly encourages faith in your moral compass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoral compass? Are you kidding me?\u201d She gave a disbelieving shake of her head. \u201cYou\u2019re a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the last one who should be judging my morals.\u201d A slow smile curved his lips and Sally\u2019s fingers tightened on the bars. If he\u2019d been handsome when all haughty and disdainful, he was outrageously gorgeous when he smiled.</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>Concentrate, Sally. This beast is the enemy. No matter how beautiful a beast he might be.</p><p>\u201cThen let me out,\u201d she challenged him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is bullshit.\u201d She glared between the bars. \u201cComplete and utter bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, taken off guard by the abrupt question. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been out for forty-eight hours; do you need food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty-eight hours?\u201d she breathed in shock. Dammit. She\u2019d thought she\u2019d been out an hour, maybe two. \u201cWhat did you give me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA drug to make you sleep.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s harmless to humans.\u201d</p><p>Fury raced through her at the risk the leeches had taken with her life. The drug might very well have been safe for humans, but she wasn\u2019t entirely human.</p><p>Not that she was going to admit as much. It was a secret she intended to take to her grave.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard of allergic reactions?\u201d she instead growled. \u201cYou could have killed me.\u201d</p><p>His bored expression revealed his supreme indifference to whether she lived or died.</p><p>Yeah. \u00dcber-jerk.</p><p>\u201cDo you want food or not?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to tell him to shove his offer up his ass. Thankfully she wasn\u2019t stubborn enough to cut off her nose to spite her face. She needed to keep up her energy if she was going to find a way out of the dungeons.</p><p>And fuel if she was going to risk using her secret mojo.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you nibble lettuce like most females?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA double bacon cheeseburger with loaded potato skins and a chocolate shake,\u201d she ordered. \u201cOh, and one of those deep-fried apple pies.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can throw in a few Buffalo wings with blue cheese dipping sauce.\u201d</p><p>His gaze briefly lowered to her tiny frame, which barely weighed a hundred pounds soaking wet. For a fleeting second his gaze lingered and his eyes flared, as if he\u2019d just been hit by an unpleasant sensation. Then, with an obvious effort, he was shaking off his strange reaction.</p><p>\u201cYour funeral,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Sally rolled her eyes. \u201cI hang around with deranged curs and megalomaniac vampires, not to mention evil deities; I doubt it\u2019s cholesterol that\u2019s going to put me in my grave.\u201d</p><p>Again that glorious indifference to her expected life span. \u201cIt will be at least half an hour. The chef here only cooks vegetarian, so they\u2019ll have to order out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVegetarian?\u201d She blinked, wondering if it was some sort of inside joke. \u201cI thought the Anasso\u2019s mate was a pure-blooded Were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she . . .\u201d Sally gave a shake of her head. \u201cNever mind. I\u2019ve clearly stumbled into a madhouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat about sums it up,\u201d he said, so low that she barely caught the words.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cIf that\u2019s how you feel, then why are you here?\u201d \u201cBecause my king commands it.\u201d</p><p>Hmmm. A stewing mutiny?</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re always an obedient little soldier?\u201d</p><p>Easily seeing through her attempt at \u201cdivide and conquer,\u201d the vampire turned to leave. \u201cI\u2019ll return with the food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>He muttered a low curse, glancing over his shoulder. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long am I going to be held a prisoner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s up to Styx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just leave me trapped down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>He walked away, exposing the most delectable butt she\u2019d ever seen encased in denims. She swallowed a groan at the desire that flared through her, pretending she was leaning her head through the bars to yell at the bastard and not to admire his fine backside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cold-blooded and heartless bastard, leech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoke.\u201d</p><p>She frowned as his disembodied voice floated through the air. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy name is Roke, not leech.\u201d</p><p>Roke walked away despite the annoying urge to turn around and release Sally Grace from the barren cell.</p><p>Dammit, what was wrong with him?</p><p>Okay, the female was pretty. Astonishingly pretty. He\u2019d known that from the moment he\u2019d caught sight of her in the dungeon\u2019s monitor. So what? Weren\u2019t there thousands of women who were far more beautiful? Certainly they were all more charming.</p><p>The spiteful little witch had the tongue of a shrew and the temperament of a rattlesnake.</p> <p>Then why did he have to force his feet to carry him out of the dungeons?</p><p>It had to be because she managed to look so pale and young and defenseless, he grimly reassured himself, grimacing as he entered the marble hallway. There was a part of him that was an instinctive protector of the weak. Perhaps it was natural to be bothered by the sight of such a small, fragile creature locked in the cells that were a level beneath the original dungeons and devised for only the most dangerous of Styx\u2019s enemies.</p><p>A nice explanation.</p><p>Unfortunately it didn\u2019t explain why he\u2019d been so fascinated by the warm scent of peaches that seemed to cling to her skin. Soap? Perfume?</p><p>Or the jolt of arousal that had slammed into him when he\u2019d allowed his gaze to trail down to her slender body, which was curved in all the right places.</p><p>He growled low in his throat. He didn\u2019t want to be aroused by the female. Not only because she was a witch. Vampires hated magic and magic users. All magic users. Or even because she\u2019d been a toady for the Dark Lord.</p> <p>Roke was male enough to understand that his cock didn\u2019t give a shit about the race, religion, species, or moral integrity of a potential lover. It responded to primitive needs that were disconnected from his brain.</p><p>But he\u2019d learned long ago that only a fool gave in to his passions. Especially when it involved an unworthy female.</p><p>These days he was very selective about the women he took to his bed. He wanted a female he could respect and who understood his duty to his clan. One he could depend on not to make demands.</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought I had piss-poor people skills,\u201d a deep voice drawled.</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d Roke retorted, watching the massive Aztec step through an open door to block his path.</p><p>The Anasso was casually dressed in jeans and a black T-shirt, his hair pulled into a long braid, but there was nothing casual in the heavy, pulsing power that filled the air.</p><p>Roke clenched his hands. He was too alpha not to react to the unspoken challenge in the air, although he was wise enough to keep his instincts tightly leashed.</p><p>Styx narrowed his dark eyes. \u201cIs this mood because I asked you to keep an eye on our prisoner, or because she\u2019s a witch?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a nanny,\u201d he growled, not about to admit the arousal that continued to plague him.</p><p>Styx\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cThank the gods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad one of us finds this amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stuck here for now,\u201d the king pointed out. \u201cYou can snap and snarl like a rabid hellhound or you can accept your fate with a little grace.\u201d</p><p>Grace?</p><p>Roke hadn\u2019t wanted to come to Chicago in the first place, but the Anasso had insisted they needed his rare talent for reading prophecies. Then, just when he was preparing to return to his clan in Nevada, the prophet, Cassandra, had claimed to have seen him in one of her visions.</p><p>Now he was stuck in this godforsaken palace of marble and gilt, so bored out of his mind that he was beginning to imagine he could be attracted to a pint-sized witch.</p><p>\u201cJust because that damned prophet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful, Roke,\u201d Styx interrupted, his power edged with pinpricks of warning. \u201cThat \u2018damned prophet\u2019 is part of my family.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra was the sister to Styx\u2019s mate, Darcy. Both pure-blooded Weres, but well-deserving of respect.</p><p>\u201cI, like everyone, revere the prophet. But, just because she saw me in one of her visions, the gods only know how long ago, doesn\u2019t mean I have to be trapped in Chicago,\u201d he clarified.</p><p>\u201cTrapped?\u201d</p><p>His fangs ached. He needed to bite something.</p><p>Or someone.</p><p>Perhaps a tiny female with hair the color of autumn, rich brown eyes, and the sweet scent of peaches . . .</p><p>No, dammit.</p><p>He turned to glare at the Mary Cassatt painting framed on the wall. Not that he could disguise his unease from Styx. The ancient vampire wasn\u2019t the Anasso just because he had the biggest sword.</p><p>\u201cI need to be with my clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra doesn\u2019t have random visions,\u201d Styx reminded him with a growing impatience. \u201cIt has to be important.\u201d</p><p>Roke shoved his hands into the front pockets of his jeans. \u201cYour lair isn\u2019t the center of the universe. Something important could just as easily happen in Nevada.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause and Roke could physically feel the weight of Styx\u2019s searching gaze.</p><p>\u201cRoke, is there something going on I should know about?\u201d he asked. \u201cSome reason you\u2019re so eager to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to leave since the day I got here,\u201d he reminded his companion, there was enough truth in his words to divert the persistent vampire. \u201cBesides, the prophet hasn\u2019t had another vision. Maybe whatever is supposed to happen is years away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil we know what the danger is, I won\u2019t allow you to be without our protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been taking care of myself for a very long time,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cNow you have us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me.\u201d</p><p>Styx slammed a hand on his shoulder. \u201cDamn straight.\u201d</p><p>Nefri ignored Santiago as she moved with blinding speed out of the kitchen and up the narrow stairs.</p><p>No, that was not entirely true.</p><p>Who could ignore a six-foot-plus male who was only a step behind her as she made her way down the narrow hall? Especially when he was nearly quivering with the need to pull her behind him and take the lead. A typical male with a big sword and bigger ego who always wanted to be in charge.</p><p>Or maybe he merely wanted to protect her, a renegade voice whispered in the back of her mind.</p><p>A voice that she easily crushed as the stench of rotting flesh became nearly overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cDios,\u201d Santiago muttered. \u201cWhat has that gargoyle done?\u201d Levet abruptly stepped around a corner, his gray skin an ashen shade in the moonlight. \u201cI did nothing beyond locate a room hidden behind a spell of illusion,\u201d he said, defending himself.</p><p>Santiago made a sound of disgust. \u201cThat\u2019s why we didn\u2019t catch the stench miles away.\u201d</p><p>Nefri muttered an ancient curse, infuriated by the knowledge she\u2019d allowed Santiago\u2019s arrival to distract her. She\u2019d been too long behind the Veil. The constant peace and sense of security had dulled her senses and made her sloppy. \u201cI should have searched for illusions the moment I arrived,\u201d she chastised herself.</p><p>\u201cAh yes, I forgot that little talent,\u201d Santiago drawled, referring to her rare ability to break through lesser spells.</p><p>\u201cI wish I had left the illusion in place.\u201d Levet shifted uneasily, his wings drooping. \u201cI do not believe you want to see what has been done, ma ch\u00e9rie.\u201d</p><p>Nefri was certain he was right. The smell alone was enough to make her stomach clench. And there was something else. Something as dark and ancient as time.</p><p>But she\u2019d been sent by the Oracles for a reason. She couldn\u2019t turn her back on her duty.</p><p>\u201cMerci, Levet, but I must know what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA massacre,\u201d the tiny gargoyle breathed, reluctantly stepping aside as Nefri rounded the corner and moved toward the open door.</p><p>She\u2019d barely reached the edge of the threshold when Santiago was angling to put his body between her and whatever was waiting inside, his sword drawn and his fangs exposed.</p><p>She rolled her eyes at his protective manner. She was one of the most powerful demons ever to walk the earth. The last thing she needed was a knight in shining armor. But even as the clan chief in her warned she needed to nip his Neanderthal behavior in the bud, another part was wryly accepting that Santiago was far too stubborn to be properly trained.</p><p>A knowledge that should have annoyed her, not sent a tiny thrill of excitement shooting through her heart.</p><p>The inane thought was swiftly forgotten as Santiago came to a sharp halt, his broad back tensing. \u201cWhat the . . .\u201d He made a sound of disgust. \u201cCristo. It looks like the set of Saw.\u201d</p><p>She frowned in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA horror flick.\u201d</p><p>Nefri shuddered. Her time behind the Veil meant that she wasn\u2019t always up to date with human entertainment, but she did know that the current trend in films included a lot of blood and violence.</p><p>Steeling her nerves, she forced herself to step past Santiago\u2019s large body and studied the carnage spread across the room.</p><p>Levet had been right.</p><p>It was bad.</p><p>Even by demon standards.</p><p>The victims were all human, some male and some female, although it was nearly impossible to tell in the hideous mix of body parts, some of which were still shackled to the walls while others were piled in the middle of the blood-soaked floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWere they tortured?\u201d she asked, pointing to the knives and even an ax that were nearly hidden beneath the gore.</p><p>Santiago returned his sword to its scabbard, his expression grim. \u201cWorse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could be worse?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were forced to torture themselves trying to escape. The room reeks of . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFear,\u201d she finished for him, the lingering terror in the room crawling over her skin like an insidious disease.</p><p>They fell silent as they considered the slaughter. With an effort, Nefri coldly stripped away the horror of what she was seeing to concentrate on basic facts.</p><p>There were five\u2014no six\u2014humans spread across the wooden floor. They were all young, perhaps in their early twenties, and what was left of their clothing suggested they hadn\u2019t been homeless. Local college students?</p><p>They\u2019d been held in the room for at least a week and occasionally fed and watered if the amount of waste mixed in with the mess was any indication. They\u2019d been physically fit. There was no other way they could have endured such punishment for such a length of time.</p> <p>And all were mutilated beyond the point of recognition.</p><p>To have been able to keep so many suffering people hidden behind the illusion for such a length of time took more than the usual enchantment.</p><p>She took a step further into the room, allowing her senses to flow through the thick air. She should be able to pick up something. A scent. A lingering trace of power. A stray piece of DNA left behind.</p><p>But there was nothing.</p><p>Which spoke for itself.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t Gaius\u2019s doing,\u201d Santiago at last broke into the heavy silence. \u201cAt least not on his own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she softly agreed.</p><p>Strong, slender fingers closed around Nefri\u2019s upper arm and Santiago pulled her back into the hallway, turning her to meet his piercing gaze. \u201cNefri, this is no longer a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what the hell is going on.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t discuss this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you freaking kidding me?\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His raw power swirled through the air, reminding her that he wasn\u2019t one of her docile clansmen. Santiago was ruled by primitive passions and male impulses.</p> <p>\u201cDo you see that massacre?\u201d he snapped, pointing toward the open door.</p><p>She met him glare for glare. \u201cI can hardly miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you still want to play politics?\u201d</p><p>Her hands clenched at the unfair accusation. The last thing she wanted was to be caught in politics. Wasn\u2019t that the reason she\u2019d retreated behind the Veil in the first place?</p><p>\u201cIf you want answers, then approach the Oracles and ask your questions,\u201d she informed him in icy tones, turning on her heel to walk away.</p><p>It was that or tossing him through the nearest window.</p><p>\u201cNefri.\u201d In the blink of an eye he was standing in front of her, blocking her path. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving until you tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>She lifted a warning hand, her fangs extended. \u201cYou\u2019re a typical alpha male, Santiago, but you\u2019re not stupid.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI give orders, I don\u2019t take them.\u201d</p><p>Gaius\u2019s new lair in Wisconsin</p><p>Unlike Louisiana, northern Wisconsin was already in the grip of late autumn. The night air was edged with frost and the countryside filled with sugar maples that were in full glory, painting the dark sky in shades of gold and crimson.</p><p>Locating a remote cabin in the middle of a thick patch of woods, Gaius made swift work of the elderly couple, draining them dry before burying them deep in the rocky ground. Then, ensuring his beloved Dara was comfortable in the upstairs loft, he spent the remainder of the night covering the windows with heavy shutters and reinforcing the doors, belatedly thankful that his essence had been destroyed weeks ago by the witch. No one would be able to follow his trail.</p><p>Still it was only when he was certain that he\u2019d made the place as safe as possible that he climbed the narrow stairs and crossed the wood-planked floor to the bed covered by a handstitched quilt.</p><p>His feet briefly faltered as the body in the center of the bed faded to a black mist, as if it were as insubstantial as a cloud. Then, the darkness coalesced into a slender female form that was covered in a short skirt and halter top he\u2019d found in his previous lair.</p><p>A figment of his imagination, he assured himself, ignoring the fact that it wasn\u2019t the first time his mate had appeared less than . . . corporeal.</p><p>Continuing forward, he gazed down at the perfect oval of Dara\u2019s honey-tinted face framed by a curtain of straight, blue-black hair. She was so beautiful, he acknowledged with a pang of longing.</p><p>Exquisite.</p><p>A daughter of the desert.</p><p>Carefully, he perched on the edge of the bed, running a hand through his black hair he kept short and slicked back from his lean face, which had once been considered handsome with a wide brow and prominent nose. Although now it was covered with dirt and blood, making him look more like a savage than the proud Roman general he\u2019d once been.</p><p>Even his black chinos and silk shirt that had once been pristine were wrinkled and torn and so filthy they were impossible to recognize.</p><p>He needed to remember something, he thought in confusion. Something important. But what?</p><p>Almost as if sensing his growing confusion, Dara lifted her lashes to reveal eyes as dark as the night sky. \u201cGaius.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, unconsciously careful not to touch her. \u201cYes, beloved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to feed.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at the soft words. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still weak.\u201d</p><p>Gaius shuddered. He was a vampire who had more than a passing acquaintance with violence. During his years with the Dark Lord he\u2019d committed atrocities that would once have sickened him.</p><p>But Dara\u2019s uncharacteristic lust for feedings that were as depraved as they were bloody was more than disturbing. They were dangerous.</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs something troubling you, habibi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe humans become annoyingly agitated when their families begin to disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just got settled here.\u201d</p><p>A pleading expression touched her beautiful face. \u201cDo you want me to suffer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d he harshly denied. \u201cWhat if I bring you a few demons? An imp or some fairies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd draw the attention of the Oracles?\u201d A strange heaviness filled the room. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d</p><p>A warning fluttered at the edges of his mind. \u201cThe Oracles.\u201d</p><p>She slowly sat upright, her liquid gaze holding him with a gripping intensity. \u201cI warned you, habibi, they will send me back if they learn I have escaped my grave.\u201d</p><p>Stark fear filled his heart at the mere thought of losing his mate. He\u2019d mourned her for decades. He couldn\u2019t endure such loss again.</p><p>\u201cI will protect you with my life,\u201d he swore.</p><p>A smile of satisfaction touched her lips. \u201cYes, you will.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Louisiana wetlands</p><p>Santiago\u2019s seething frustration was briefly forgotten as he glared at the pale face that flushed with anger. Her quiet, aloof perfection was transformed into a vivid, blazing beauty that seared through him, changing him on some fundamental level.</p><p>The odd thought had barely time to form before Nefri was smoothly returning behind her frigid barriers, her emotions retreating to a place he couldn\u2019t reach.</p><p>Santiago\u2019s hands clenched, a snarl caught in his throat. He didn\u2019t know why her icy composure set his teeth on edge, but the sight of her rigid expression made him want to smash through her defenses. She could play the ice princess with everyone but him.</p><p>Never him.</p><p>Ignoring his power, which sizzled through the air and stirred the silken curtain of her ebony hair, she squared her shoulders, as if preparing herself for some unpleasant duty.</p><p>\u201cCan you find Gaius?\u201d she at last demanded.</p><p>He studied her with a brooding gaze. \u201cHe\u2019s moved far enough away that I have only a general direction, but once I\u2019m closer I won\u2019t have any trouble cornering the bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will allow you to lead me to him.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019ll allow me?\u201d</p><p>She gave a regal nod. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>So, not just an ice princess, but Queen-of-the-freaking-Universe.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She went predator-still at his blunt refusal. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me make it easy.\u201d A humorless smile touched his lips. \u201cN. O. No.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYou just demanded that you be included in the search.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you that the rules have changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you that you don\u2019t make the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you want my help you will not only plead nicely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her interruption, reaching to run his fingers down the cool silk of her hair. \u201cBut you will tell me what you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He expected her to knock aside his hand; instead she turned smoothly away, offering him a view of her rigid back.</p><p>\u201cLevet,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>With a smug twitch of his wings, the aggravating pest waddled forward. \u201cOui, ma ch\u00e9rie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>Santiago was moving to block her path before his brain was fully engaged. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool, Nefri.\u201d</p><p>The gargoyle made a choked sound, stepping behind Nefri to avoid being damaged in the crossfire. Not so stupid as Santiago had assumed.</p><p>Nefri arched a dark brow, the temperature dropping by several chilling degrees. \u201cDo you think because I\u2019m a female I won\u2019t hurt you?\u201d</p><p>His brain jerked back into gear, forcing him to halt and actually consider his words. \u201cI think that you will do anything to prevent another massacre,\u201d he said, not hesitating to use her horror at the brutal slaughter to his advantage. There was no way she was leaving this house without him. Not because Styx had ordered him to discover what was going on with Gaius. Or because he had a score to settle with his sire. But because. That was it. Just because. \u201cEven endure my distasteful company.\u201d</p> <p>Levet sent Santiago a raspberry, but his expression was resigned as he glanced back at Nefri. \u201cMa ch\u00e9rie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, Levet,\u201d she said, her words coated in ice, her gaze never wavering from Santiago. \u201cIt appears we must be temporary allies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak,\u201d she overrode his response. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I will be treated with anything less than respect. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>He stepped back in her personal space. \u201cThe one thing you will always have, cara, is my respect,\u201d he said with a blunt sincerity she couldn\u2019t miss. Even when she was driving him nuts he respected everything about her. Her strength, her intelligence, and her obvious loyalty. \u201cBut you\u2019re not my clan chief and I will never take commands from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you take commands from your own chief?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>Santiago shrugged. \u201cWhen I agree with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pity Viper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always been pleased with my service.\u201d His gaze skimmed down to her cherry lips. \u201cYou would be even more pleased if you would give me the opportunity to service you.\u201d</p><p>Something hot and wild flared through her midnight eyes before she was giving a sharp shake of her head and firmly skirting past his large form. \u201cThis will never work.\u201d</p><p>He muttered a curse as he once again moved to block her path. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA truce.\u201d</p><p>Her expression was predictably wary. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p> <p>He held up his hands in a gesture of peace. \u201cI will try my best not to be excessively annoying and you will treat me as a partner, not your minion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will halt your crude innuendos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSantiago . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t make promises I can\u2019t keep,\u201d he admitted, knowing his gnawing need to break through her ice wouldn\u2019t allow him to back off. \u201cBut I do swear that I\u2019ll do everything in my power to track down Gaius.\u201d</p><p>She considered his promise for a long minute. \u201cAnd your demand that I reveal my private business with the Oracles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it private.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cI have a horrible premonition I\u2019m going to discover for myself why they\u2019ve decided to meddle after standing on the sidelines during the battle against the Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeday that tongue of yours is going to get you in deep trouble,\u201d she smoothly warned.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI\u2019ve been there, done that, and have the scars to prove it.\u201d</p><p>Her dark, piercing gaze studied the bitter twist to his lips. \u201cIs there a reason you don\u2019t learn from your mistakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurvival in the pits means never giving ground, even when the result is a beating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pits?\u201d A shadow touched her face. \u201cYou were a Gladiator?\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened, the memory of the vampires who\u2019d caged him like an animal and forced him to fight for his life every night searing through his mind. \u201cNot by choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . see,\u201d she said softly, and Santiago had a terrible sensation that she did. More than he wanted. \u201cHow long were you forced to fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo long,\u201d he said in clipped tones, turning to move down the hallway. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Most females would have retreated in fear as the air thickened with his power. Nefri, of course, wasn\u2019t most females. Without seeming effort she was walking at his side, not bothering to hide her curiosity. \u201cDo you ever talk about those days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re too painful?\u201d</p><p>He turned to stab her with an annoyed glare. \u201cDo you ever talk about the reason you retreated behind the Veil?\u201d</p><p>Her pale features were suddenly wiped of all emotion. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>The dungeons of Styx\u2019s lair</p><p>Sally wasn\u2019t sure how much time had passed. An hour? Two?</p><p>Not that she was in any hurry for her irritating guard to return, she assured herself. He might have the finest butt in the Northern Hemisphere, and the sort of eyes that could make some idiotic women melt, but he was as cold as ice and as smugly superior as every other leech.</p><p>Still, she was becoming bored out of her mind stuck in this bleak cell. Not to mention she needed food to replenish her fading strength.</p><p>And, with any luck at all the poor schmuck who was stuck playing babysitter to the nasty witch would be a lesser demon.</p><p>One she could attempt to use her powers on.</p><p>Of course, her luck had been downright shitty over the past few years, so it really shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise when the door to the dungeon opened and she caught the distinctive scent of a powerful male vampire.</p><p>Cold steel and ruthless sensuality.</p><p>So much for a lesser demon.</p><p>Roke was as lethal as they came.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>She halted her pacing near the door of the cell, her heart missing a painful beat as he stepped into view. She told herself that it was fear. What female in her right mind wouldn\u2019t be terrified at the sight of a demon who could kill her between one breath and the next?</p><p>It certainly had nothing to do with the stark male beauty of his perfectly chiseled face, or the haunting mystery of his strange silver eyes.</p><p>No. Nothing at all.</p><p>And to make certain she wouldn\u2019t be so stupid as to forget the beautiful creature was anything but her enemy, Roke approached the door of her cell with a dark scowl. Clearly he\u2019d pissed off Styx and was serving some sort of penance. With her as his punishment.</p><p>\u201cStand away from the door,\u201d he commanded, holding a tray in his hands filled with plates of hamburgers, fries, a chocolate shake, Buffalo wings, and deep-fried apple pie.</p><p>She planted her hands on her hips, telling herself she wasn\u2019t hurt by the vampire\u2019s barely concealed disdain. What the hell did she care? He was nothing but a . . . a member of the walking dead.</p><p>Okay, he was gorgeous and there was a bad boy vibe that some females might find fascinating, but right now she wanted nothing more than to kick him in the nuts.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m going to do?\u201d she mocked. \u201cThe hexes prevent me from using my magic. And in case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m half your size.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid down her slender curves, a muscle knotting in his jaw as he jerked his stare back to her face. Was he repulsed by her less than voluptuous shape?</p><p>Well, screw him.</p><p>\u201cI never underestimate an enemy,\u201d he retorted. \u201cEspecially when they appear helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnemy?\u201d She offered a humorless smile. \u201cI came here to help, in case you\u2019ve forgotten, you ass. So exactly when did I become your enemy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you tried to unleash the Dark Lord and his minions,\u201d he retorted without hesitation.</p><p>She hunched a shoulder, wondering just how long she was going to have to pay for that unfortunate decision.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have any choice,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou were forced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only way to survive\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn easy excuse,\u201d he interrupted her with cold disapproval. \u201cBut then I would expect nothing else of a witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic is a cheat against everything that is natural. An abomination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t feel like you have to hold back,\u201d she rasped, acting as if she didn\u2019t give a damn what he thought of her. He wasn\u2019t the first, and he certainly wouldn\u2019t be the last to hate her for no good reason. \u201cWhat do the feelings of a witch matter?\u201d</p><p>Something flared in his silver eyes.

It wasn\u2019t as if anyone would give a damn. And the goddess knew it wouldn\u2019t get her out of this dungeon.</p><p>With slow, deliberate steps, Sally backed into a corner, her smile mocking. \u201cIs this far enough, oh mighty leech?\u201d</p><p>With a muttered curse, he used his powers to unlock the cell door and stepped inside. \u201cI should let you starve,\u201d he grumbled.</p> <p>She wrapped her arms around her waist, shivering as the cool surge of his power filled the air. Shiver in fear, she grimly assured herself. Not excitement.</p><p>\u201cWhen can I speak with the Anasso?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her abrupt question, placing the tray on the narrow bed that was her only furniture.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously to plead my case.\u201d</p> <p>Straightening, Roke regarded her with an unreadable expression. \u201cYou\u2019ll remain here so long as he believes you might be a threat.\u201d</p><p>A threat? All she wanted was to disappear into a small cottage in the middle of nowhere. How could that be a threat to anyone?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming that means you haven\u2019t captured Gaius.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you know where he\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were his accomplice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHardly,\u201d she denied, her voice harsh as she recalled her short alliance with Gaius. \u201cI was forced to help him search for the prophet. I barely knew the arrogant ass, and what I did know I didn\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>Roke dismissed her explanation with a wave of his slender hand. \u201cDid you travel with him to any other lairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she hissed between gritted teeth. \u201cAnd before you ask, he never spoke of any. Our relationship wasn\u2019t based on trust.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cThen what was it built on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMutual need and fear.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened, as if he didn\u2019t want to think she might not be the evil, unrepentant bitch he wanted to paint her.</p><p>\u201cEat.\u201d</p><p>Forcing herself to cross the cell, she perched on the edge of the bed and picked up one of the cheeseburgers. She was a multitasker\u2014could eat and glare at the bastard at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cAre you always so bossy?\u201d she demanded between bites.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cGive your mate my deepest sympathies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mate is none of your concern,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Thank the goddess, she told herself. Being stuck with this surly beast would be nothing short of hell.</p><p>Of course, a night or two exploring that chiseled body . . .</p><p>No. She was obviously delusional from hunger.</p><p>Working her way through the hamburger and the plate of fries, she did her best to ignore the grim-faced predator watching her every move with a brooding intensity. At last reaching for a Buffalo wing, she pointed it toward her silent companion. \u201cAre you going to just stand there watching me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Do you think I can use a French fry to escape?\u201d she asked in sickly sweet tones. \u201cOr maybe the cook hid a file in my apple pie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStyx believes you could help us locate Gaius.\u201d</p><p>She returned her attention to her plate, hiding her expression as she dipped her wing into the blue cheese dressing. \u201cI\u2019ve told you everything I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said Gaius was different when he returned to his lair. What did you mean?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI had a few errands to run and when I came back Gaius was just standing in the hallway like a zombie. For a minute I thought his carcass had been stuffed and left there as some kind of sick joke. But when I actually stepped into the hallway he reacted like a feral animal. It was creepy as hell.\u201d</p><p>Roke frowned. \u201cWas his intent to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t stupid enough to remain around long enough to find out if he wanted me dead or just injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you claim he didn\u2019t recognize you?\u201d</p><p>She ate her wing and reached for another. \u201cHe acted like he didn\u2019t. I suppose he could have been pretending, but I don\u2019t see the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you suspect he had someone with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone or something he was protecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She doggedly kept her head down, replenishing her energy as he put her through the Inquisition. The only thing missing were the whips and chains.</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d she said with a full mouth.</p><p>He shifted with impatience. \u201cWhy do you suspect that he was protecting something?\u201d</p><p>She trembled at the memory of the malevolent energy that had surrounded the house, repulsing her spell and contaminating the very air with evil.</p><p>Not that she was going to confess her true reason for suspecting that Gaius had a new and very powerful ally.</p><p>Not when she would have to confess she\u2019d used dark magic against a fellow vampire of Roke\u2019s.</p><p>She was in enough trouble as it was, thank you very much.</p><p>\u201cHe was behaving like a wild dog guarding his favorite bone,\u201d she at last hedged.</p><p>She felt his gaze boring into the top of her head like a laser.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>With an effort she tilted back her head to meet his fierce glare. \u201cI am not.\u201d</p><p>There was enough truth in her words to make him hesitate. \u201cAt the very least you\u2019re not revealing everything you know,\u201d he at last accused her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a mind reader?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne way or another I\u2019ll discover the truth, little witch,\u201d he growled, turning on his heel to head out of the cell.</p><p>Briefly startled by his departure, Sally rose to her feet. Her strength was returning, but what good would it do her if she couldn\u2019t use it to escape?</p><p>She needed someone she could manipulate.</p><p>Someone who wasn\u2019t a powerful vampire who made her think of sweet, forbidden things.</p><p>\u201cDoes it have to be you?\u201d</p><p>Halting, he glanced over his shoulder at her abrupt question. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have a different guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should think that was obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndulge me.\u201d</p><p>Her chin tilted. \u201cI don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>His body went rigid, his eyes darkening with something that might have been outrage. \u201cIn case you didn\u2019t notice, you\u2019re in the dungeons,\u201d he snarled, his power nearly suffocating. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky the keys haven\u2019t been thrown away and your luscious little body left for the wolves. Literally.\u201d</p><p>What the hell was wrong with him? He acted as if she\u2019d insulted him . . . Wait\u2014did he just call her body luscious?</p><p>Dammit, Sally, concentrate.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, she refused to back down. \u201cEven a condemned criminal gets a last request, Roke. And mine is that I don\u2019t have to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Louisiana wetlands</p><p>Nefri allowed Santiago to lead her from the house, resolutely maintaining her air of detachment while deep inside she was an emotional mess.</p><p>That room . . .</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just the blood and guts.</p><p>She was an ancient vampire who\u2019d witnessed just about every depravity that demons and humans could imagine. It was the lingering evil that seemed to cling to the air. Like an oil slick that polluted everything it touched. Dear lord. She wanted to stand beneath a shower and scrub herself from head to toe.</p><p>And just as confusing were the violent emotions the vampire walking at her side inspired. He was infuriating, illogical, stubborn, and so typically male that she wanted to scream. He was also wickedly charming, unexpectedly intelligent, and intensely loyal to his clan.</p><p>One minute she wanted to have him muzzled, and the next she wanted to wrap herself in his raw power and kiss him senseless.</p><p>Which terrified her.</p><p>Granted, it\u2019d been a long time since she\u2019d last taken a lover, but she knew that this extreme awareness of Santiago had nothing to do with sexual frustration. Or even a brief bout of lust.</p><p>She wished it was.</p><p>Lust she could easily satisfy. Either with Santiago or with one of her own clansmen.</p><p>But this restless craving that was spreading through her body wasn\u2019t going to be ended by a swift, discreet tumble. Not that Santiago would ever be swift or discreet in bed, a renegade voice whispered in the back of her mind. He would be fierce and dominant and outrageously demanding. No doubt he would leave a female feeling thoroughly ravaged . . . in the most gratifying way.</p><p>Her hands clenched as she banished the image of Santiago poised naked above her, his hips nestled between her parted thighs.</p><p>Had she gone mad?</p><p>There was something out there that terrified even the Oracles. Now was not the time to be reacting as if she were a silly foundling still at the mercy of her passions. With an effort she hid behind the cool composure that allowed her to pretend a control she was far from feeling.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked as Santiago headed up the narrow path. With the thick canopy of trees and creeping moss it looked more like a tunnel to some weird Land of the Lost than a main road to the nearest town.</p><p>Somewhere overhead Levet was hunting for his evening meal, but the thick foliage made it impossible to sense anything beyond a few feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At her side, Santiago pulled his sword from its scabbard, his eyes scanning the shadows. \u201cI left my truck hidden outside town.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. Of course he would have a truck. A heavy bully of a vehicle with a too-powerful engine that wouldn\u2019t be stopped by a mere roadblock. Her lips thinned with annoyance at her unruly thoughts.</p><p>\u201cAfter that.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged, his gaze continuing to search the thick line of trees that bordered the road.</p><p>\u201cNorth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorth? That\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you being deliberately vague?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I only have a faint sense of Gaius,\u201d he explained. \u201cI told you, once I\u2019m closer I\u2019ll be able to pinpoint his location.\u201d</p><p>She believed him, even if she didn\u2019t want to. The bond she\u2019d formed with her own sire had been destroyed several centuries ago, but she did remember that she rarely had more than a vague impression of his direction.</p><p>But the thought of spending several nights with Santiago as they searched for Gaius was more disturbing than she wanted to admit.</p><p>\u201cWe could travel much faster if we use my medallion.\u201d</p><p>He hissed, shooting her a startled glance. \u201cNo fuc\u2014\u201d He bit off his crude response, but his expression remained resolute. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She lifted her fingers to touch the warm medallion that rested just above her unbeating heart. \u201cIt would be much quicker.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just regained my bond with Gaius. I\u2019m not going to do anything to risk it.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to the side. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the only reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to admit that popping from one place to another freaks me out?\u201d he growled, clearly still pissed at the last time she\u2019d taken him mist-walking. \u201cFine. It freaks me out.\u201d</p><p>She resisted the urge to tease. Not because Santiago couldn\u2019t laugh at himself. His ready sense of humor was one of his more disarming traits. But because with this man it felt too much like flirting.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened with suspicion. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe medallion that Gaius possesses is connected to mine.\u201d She allowed her fingers to drop from the metal that always felt alive. Even sentient. \u201cI can\u2019t be certain he wouldn\u2019t sense me if I use it.\u201d</p><p>His pace slowed, as if he\u2019d been struck by a sudden thought. \u201cHave you used it since you returned to this world?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s necessary to travel through the Veil, but I haven\u2019t called on its powers since I\u2019ve been here. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems more than a coincidence that Gaius would abandon his lair only a night or two before we arrived.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Smart vampire. Gaius might very well have sensed her approach if she\u2019d used the medallion. Instead it had been Siljar who\u2019d opened a portal a few miles from the house.</p><p>Which meant that she had no answer for why Gaius had abandoned his lair.</p><p>\u201cThere was a scent of humans in the area,\u201d she speculated aloud.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer scent was distinct and fading,\u201d Nefri said, making a mental note to tell the Oracles that there\u2019d been something odd about the witch\u2019s scent. She was more than she seemed. \u201cThe humans were more recent,\u201d she told Santiago. \u201cWithin the past day.\u201d</p><p>Santiago accepted her claim without argument. He was one of the few men who didn\u2019t seem intimidated by her superior powers.</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d he instead demanded.</p><p>\u201cImpossible to say, but there were more than a dozen.\u201d</p><p>He considered the various possibilities. \u201cA search party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was my thought. Such a large number of missing humans wouldn\u2019t go unnoticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical,\u201d he growled. \u201cIf they\u2019d just waited a few days we would have had Gaius cornered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she hedged, unwilling to fool herself that it would be simple. The Oracles wouldn\u2019t have sent her if it was just a case of finding Gaius and asking him to come along nicely.</p><p>He turned to study her with a searching gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of that \u2018maybe.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaius has obviously been altered,\u201d she hedged. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what new powers he might have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he abruptly denied. \u201cNot altered.\u201d</p><p>Tread warily, Nefri. . . . \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe witch said he acted like he was under some sort of compulsion,\u201d he said, his tone accusing.</p><p>She bit back her words of annoyance. The witch was not only more than she seemed, but she was far too observant for her own good.</p><p>She needed to be watched. If only for her own safety. \u201cHe\u2019s too powerful a vampire to be enthralled,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re saying the witch was lying?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly not.\u201d</p><p>His flare of irritation swirled through the air, biting into her skin.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess\u2014you can\u2019t tell me anything about his companion,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Her lips twisted into a wry smile. The buzz of insects fell silent and a dozen small animals scuttled away in sharp fear at Santiago\u2019s sour mood. How long had it been since she\u2019d spent time with a man who was willing to stand up to her?</p><p>Too long, if the strange sensations sizzling through her veins were anything to go by.</p><p>It was one thing to feel a measure of admiration for Santiago after centuries of being surrounded by sycophants who rarely dared to question her decisions, let alone treat her as if he were her equal. And quite another to shiver in sizzling arousal.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t because I truly don\u2019t know,\u201d she informed her companion, her voice coated in an extra layer of ice. There was no way she was going to allow this man to sense her growing vulnerability. He was a predator who would pounce on the first hint of weakness. \u201cI\u2019m merely a servant of the Oracles, not their confidante.\u201d</p><p>Santiago growled, but before he could express his smoldering frustration, there was the rustle of leaves above them and the pungent scent of granite.</p><p>\u201cGargoyle,\u201d Santiago instead muttered, stepping back as Levet floated down on his fairy wings to land on the path between them.</p><p>The gargoyle stuck his tongue toward the male vampire. \u201cI do have a name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were hunting,\u201d Nefri intruded into the male sniping.</p><p>Levet readily turned in her direction. \u201cI was until I noticed the herd of people heading this way.\u201d</p><p>Santiago frowned. \u201cAt this hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be another search party,\u201d Nefri suggested.</p><p>\u201cMore like a lynch mob,\u201d Levet corrected, his tail twitching. \u201cSacrebleu. They were shouting and waving their guns like they were overdosed on steroids.\u201d</p><p>A lynch mob? Nefri deliberately avoided Santiago\u2019s sharp gaze, a bad feeling growing in the pit of her stomach at the gargoyle\u2019s warning. Not because there was a group of people out there looking for trouble. Humans took a peculiar delight in stirring their passions to a fever pitch. She had a terrible premonition that this was more than just an overabundance of testosterone.</p><p>\u201cHow far?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Levet pointed up the path. \u201cFive miles and headed this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll cut through the swamp,\u201d Santiago announced, taking instant command. \u201cOnce we\u2019re clear of the town we can circle back and pick up my vehicle.\u201d</p><p>Nefri didn\u2019t protest. She didn\u2019t have any more desire than Santiago to run across a group of humans looking for blood, even if she was more accustomed to giving orders than taking them.</p><p>\u201cTromp through the bogs? Ewww.\u201d Levet wrinkled his snout . \u201cI am no slimy lizard. I will join you on the other side.\u201d</p><p>Nefri reached out to lay a gentle hand on the gargoyle\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTake care, Levet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerci, ma ch\u00e9rie.\u201d He offered a low bow, a sparkle in his gray eyes. \u201cYou have my promise I will take the greatest care. And if you have need of me you only have to call my name.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>With a flap of his wings, Levet was headed upward, dodging the overhanging branches with astonishing grace.</p><p>\u201cThank the gods,\u201d Santiago muttered. \u201cThat creature would try the patience of a saint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re no saint,\u201d she muttered, pointing out the obvious.</p><p>\u201cNot even close.\u201d With a wicked grin he leaned forward and claimed her lips in a short, bone-melting kiss. Then, before she could slug him, he was turning to jog off the pathway, sliding his sword back into its sheath so he could pull out a large dagger and battle through the overgrown vegetation.</p><p>Nefri stoically followed in his wake, pretending that his lethal kiss hadn\u2019t inflamed the sensual hunger that was becoming more than a mere inconvenience. That her lips weren\u2019t tingling with an excitement that she felt to the tips of her toes.</p><p>Damn it all. Why this aggravating vampire? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And why now?</p><p>Shoving aside the questions that had no answers, Nefri focused her concentration on their shadowed surroundings. With every step away from the path, the ground became more treacherous, a scent of rotting vegetation seeping from the thick layer of moss and duckweed. And while they were moving away from the angry humans, there were just as many dangers in the swamps.</p><p>Actually, more.</p> <p>Cougars and alligators lurked among the dense undergrowth as well as a dozen snakes that might not be able to kill a vampire, but could certainly make one ill for a short period of time. There were also a variety of demons who lived in the bayous, far away from the noisy mortals.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t the lurking hazards that slowly wore on Nefri\u2019s nerves. Or the discomfort of wading into the water that came to her knees.</p><p>It was, instead, the strange sensations that crawled over her skin, that made a shiver inch down her spine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d she at last said, breaking the thick silence.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m overly fond of the swamps myself, but it\u2019s better than dealing with the rabid locals,\u201d Santiago countered, his dagger slicing through a layer of Spanish moss.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the swamp,\u201d she said, shivering. \u201cCan\u2019t you feel it?\u201d</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cFeel what?\u201d</p><p>Another shiver. \u201cIt\u2019s as if there\u2019s a lingering echo of violence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it is, it has nothing to do with witches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, this is far more primal,\u201d he agreed with a grimace, his head tilted back as he tested the fading tang of aggression. \u201cMierda. It\u2019s no wonder the humans are roaming the countryside with torches and pitchforks.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled wryly. \u201cVery . . . atmospheric.\u201d</p><p>Santiago turned to battle a path through the stubborn vegetation. \u201cStay close,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>Santiago wasn\u2019t easily spooked. He\u2019d been beaten, carved up like a Thanksgiving turkey, tortured, and taken to the edge of death more times than he could count.</p><p>What was left to be afraid of?</p><p>Well . . . besides the exquisitely beautiful woman walking behind him. Any man in his right mind would be terrified by a female who tied him into knots even as she left him hard and aching with desire.</p><p>But the prickles of violence that hung in the air like a bad memory were as unnerving as hell.</p><p>And the fact that they were being followed by at least six glowing orbs that were dancing ever closer didn\u2019t ease his tension.</p><p>They had reached the middle of the swamp when the orbs shifted to block their path.</p> <p>\u201cSantiago,\u201d Nefri warned, moving to stand at his side.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been trailing us since we entered the swamp,\u201d he said, squashing the urge to shove her behind him. She was not a female who needed protection, and she wouldn\u2019t thank him for undermining her authority. Especially not with these particular demons. \u201cThe question is, why?\u201d</p><p>On cue the glowing orbs began to pulse and expand, taking on physical forms.</p><p>Holding the dagger in a loose grip, he resisted the urge to pull out his sword. No point in ratcheting up the tension until he was certain the demons intended a fight. Besides, his fangs and claws were far more lethal than any blade, no matter how sharp it might be.</p><p>There was a surge of electricity, and then the glowing lights faded to reveal the six female Harpies standing in front of them.</p><p>They were gorgeous, of course. With long black hair and gray eyes that swirled with the power of thunderclouds, their naked bodies were leanly muscled with large wings on their backs. Always formidable warriors, they used their beauty to distract their enemies before striking them down with the fireballs they could conjure from thin air.</p><p>They were also crafty as hell, easily trapping unwary males in hidden snares to hold them captive during their mating season. Not that the males usually protested, he wryly conceded. A Harpy in heat was most men\u2019s idea of a sexual fantasy. Endless days of aggressive sex with no commitment. And if some men took exception to being treated as a mere stud, the majority found their imprisonment nothing short of paradise.</p><p>Santiago, however, wasn\u2019t thinking about sex as the warriors studied him with their stormy gray eyes. Instead he watched them with a wary frown.</p><p>\u201cWe follow you because you trespass in our territory, vampire,\u201d the tallest of the Harpies said, her voice stirring the thick air.</p><p>Nefri took a half step forward, offering a regal bow. \u201cIt was not our intention to disturb your nest.\u201d</p><p>Continuing to glare in Santiago\u2019s direction, the Harpy appeared unimpressed. \u201cThe foul air has disturbed us, sister,\u201d the Harpy said.</p><p>\u201cHey, not my fault,\u201d Santiago muttered.</p><p>The closest Harpy held out her hand, a sudden ball of fire dancing just above her palm. \u201cBe quiet, male,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>\u201cHe speaks the truth,\u201d Nefri smoothly interjected.</p><p>\u201cWe will decide who speaks the truth,\u201d the taller Harpy informed them, pointing a finger in their direction. \u201cTake them.\u201d</p><p>Santiago reached for his sword, only to be halted when Nefri laid a restraining hand on his forearm. \u201cNo, Santiago. There\u2019s no need to fight,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019m certain we can reason with our companions.\u201d</p><p>His gaze never wavered from the females, who looked eager for an opportunity to singe him with their fireballs. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to be in the mood to reason,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why we shouldn\u2019t provoke them.\u201d</p><p>It was the violent urge to shake her hand off and launch himself at the Harpies that made him hesitate. He could be impulsive, but never in battle. He\u2019d learned long ago the best war was the one never fought.</p><p>It had to be the effects of the lingering spell, or whatever the hell was contaminating the air, he grimly acknowledged. Which meant one wrong move and this entire encounter could descend into a bloody massacre that none of them wanted.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d With an effort he forced himself to tuck away his dagger, and lifted his hands in surrender. \u201cBut don\u2019t blame me if this goes to hell.\u201d</p><p>The lead Harpy gestured toward the Harpy at her side. \u201cCharis, take the male to our guest rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he snapped, stepping back. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p><p>The Harpy narrowed her stormy eyes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSantiago.\u201d With a cool brush of her fingers over his cheek, Nefri managed to capture his full attention. \u201cIt will be fine. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDios,\u201d he muttered, knowing he\u2019d been undone by a mere touch. This female was going to be the death of him.</p><p>Keeping his gaze on Nefri\u2019s pale, perfect face, Santiago allowed the female Harpy to grab his arm, her wing stroking over his back with an unwelcome intimacy.</p><p>\u201cThis way, my pretty leech.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Only centuries of training allowed Nefri to disguise her flare of fury as Charis tugged Santiago through a curtain of clinging vines and disappeared from sight. How dare the young Harpy attach herself to Santiago like a barnacle. And the way she was rubbing her wings over him . . . it was indecent.</p><p>Santiago wasn\u2019t here to become her sex toy.</p><p>In fact . . .</p><p>With an effort, Nefri squashed the image of grabbing the lovely Charis by her dark hair and shaking her until her teeth rattled. Instead she calmly allowed herself to be led through the brackish water and thick undergrowth, she was only briefly startled when they stepped through a thin barrier of magic to enter a vast parkland that had cement dykes to hold back the swamp and perfectly manicured gardens that bloomed beneath the fading moonlight. In the center, a large wooden structure was suspended off the ground by a dozen sturdy trees and built on several different levels that disappeared among the thick branches.</p><p>It was large enough to house at least three dozen Harpies, with room for the communal nursery that traditionally consumed the top floor.</p><p>Acutely aware she was being watched by guards hidden among the leaves, Nefri kept her head held high and her pace steady as she was led past the flowering bignonias and pure white lilies. They left the gardens through a high archway and entered a narrow foyer that was lined with panels of glossy oak carved with elaborate designs.</p><p>A spiral staircase stood in the middle of the room and three of her companions peeled off to jog up the steep steps, while the remaining two escorted her down the hall to a room at the back of the building.</p><p>Halting at the door to stand guard, the two indicated for Nefri to enter.</p><p>As if she had a choice?</p><p>Refusing to reveal any hint of weakness, she stepped over the threshold and took a quick inventory of her surroundings. It was a large room with an open-beamed ceiling and fur rugs thrown on the wood-planked floor. She didn\u2019t look too closely at the fur, knowing it was more likely the pelt of a demon than an animal. Harpies made very bad enemies.</p><p>There were a number of priceless tapestries hung on the walls and the furniture was finely crafted and covered in a pale blue satin.</p><p>An elegant room that spoke of authority and yet with enough womanly touches to make it comfortable.</p><p>As a female ruler, Nefri appreciated the subtle statement, even as the warrior in her took in the sword leaning in a far corner and the silver letter opener on the desk near the stone fireplace. She also noticed a faint scent of gunpowder that warned there was a gun hidden somewhere nearby. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At last her attention turned toward the female standing in the center of the floor. She was tall with the long, black hair of most Harpies. There were a few silver strands threaded through the darkness, which indicated she was several centuries old, and a hard-fought wisdom in the gray eyes. At the moment she was wearing a plain white gown that was slit down the back to allow room for her wings and wide gold bracelets around her wrists that indicated she was the leader of this particular nest.</p><p>\u201cMatron,\u201d she murmured with a respectful bow of her head. Unlike most men, Nefri understood that good manners were often more persuasive than any amount of bluster and intimidation.</p><p>\u201cVampire,\u201d the woman responded, the low voice rumbling through the room like thunder.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, call me Nefri.\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded. \u201cAnd I\u2019m Solaris, Matron of this nest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am honored to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall see.\u201d The storm gray eyes held a warning as she waved her hand toward the built-in bar. \u201cI have refreshments. Or I can call for one of my sisters. There are a few who enjoy donating their blood to vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Nefri\u2019s smile remained, but the sudden realization that Santiago might even now be at the throat of some willing Harpy jolted through her, exposing a raw emotion she hadn\u2019t felt in centuries. Was that . . . jealousy? Good lord, she was losing her mind. \u201cWhere is my companion?\u201d</p> <p>The Harpy regarded her with a piercing intelligence. \u201cHe\u2019s your property?\u201d</p><p>Nefri paused to consider her answer. In Harpy society males were treated as possessions that were meant to be shared with the entire nest.</p><p>\u201cHe is under my protection,\u201d she at last said. \u201cAnd unavailable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pity.\u201d A mysterious smile curved the woman\u2019s lips. \u201cWe have several younglings about to enter their first mating heat.\u201d</p><p>Nefri\u2019s expression never altered, but she couldn\u2019t control the frigid burst of power that made the overhead chandelier sway and at least one crystal vase shatter.</p><p>\u201cA vampire can\u2019t breed.\u201d</p> <p>Solaris arched a brow. \u201cI\u2019m aware of your reproduction deficiencies, which is why I encourage the young ones to choose a vampire for their first lover. They can have all the pleasure of mating without the concern of pregnancy. Most aren\u2019t ready yet for motherhood.\u201d</p><p>Oh no. Hell no.</p><p>Two more vases shattered.</p><p>\u201cAs I said, Santiago isn\u2019t available.\u201d</p><p>The Matron ignored the destruction of her expensive collection, her own power a steady pulse that could unleash a deadly barrage of fire.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not nice to be so selfish,\u201d she chided Nefri. \u201cSuch a beautiful creature should be enjoyed by all.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t overreact, Nefri, she silently warned herself, the woman is only trying to provoke you.</p><p>\u201cFor now I have need of his skills.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill you return him when you\u2019re done with his\u201d\u2014deliberate pause\u2014\u201cskills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Solaris gave an abrupt laugh. \u201cBe careful, my sister. That one will not be easily trained.\u201d</p><p>Trained? Santiago was a barbarian.</p><p>Not that his primitive passions didn\u2019t have a certain appeal, she grudgingly conceded. In fact, she was beginning to think that a few hours of raw, untamed sex might just be what she needed to bring an end to her annoying fascination with the male vampire.</p><p>With a silent curse, she shoved Santiago to the back of her mind. Soon enough she would have to deal with her disturbing reaction to him. One way or another. But for now she needed to focus on the most immediate danger.</p><p>And the Matron was a danger, despite her gracious manner. One wrong answer and Nefri would go from being a guest to a prisoner.</p><p>Or a pile of ash.</p><p>Something she intended to avoid.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should discuss the reason you\u2019ve had me brought to your nest,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cStraight to the point?\u201d Solaris shrugged. \u201cVery well. I want to know why the vampires have declared war on us.\u201d</p><p>Nefri was on instant, full alert. War? Was this a trick?</p><p>\u201cI assure you the vampires have no desire for war with anyone, least of all the Harpies,\u201d she cautiously addressed her companion.</p><p>Solaris allowed her power to thicken the air in the room. As if Nefri needed a reminder that she was more than a match for a vampire, even one as ancient as Nefri.</p><p>\u201cThen why are they attempting to poison our lands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>With a smooth step, Solaris crossed to pour herself a glass of some milky white liquid. Nectar? Taking a sip, she turned back to study Nefri with a hard gaze.</p><p>\u201cPeace had finally settled among my people with the death of the Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has been a blessing for all of us,\u201d Nefri agreed.</p><p>\u201cA blessing as well as an opportunity for the more powerful demons to flex their muscles.\u201d The gray eyes turned dark with the threat of a looming storm. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time vampires enslaved those too weak to fight back.\u201d</p><p>Nefri wasn\u2019t stupid enough to deny the charge. The vampires had once been little better than savages who\u2019d wielded their superiority to use and abuse the less fortunate. Even if they were fellow vampires.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the past,\u201d she pointed out, meeting the accusing glare with a calm composure. \u201cThe new Anasso is eager to build alliances, not to make enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet he sent a vampire to the border of our lands who has been spreading his infection.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Nefri had harbored a small measure of hope that the local demons hadn\u2019t been aware of Gaius. Or whoever (or whatever) had caused the bloodbath in his lair.</p><p>Fooling humans was simple. Demons wouldn\u2019t be nearly so easy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re referring to Gaius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask his name. He was medium height with dark hair and a prominent nose. And a most\u201d\u2014the female shuddered\u2014\u201cpungent aroma.\u201d</p><p>Nefri hesitated. The Oracles had wanted this mess cleaned up as swiftly and quietly as possible, but with every passing minute it was obvious the danger was snowballing at a terrifying rate.</p><p>This was no time for diversions or discreet lies.</p><p>She not only needed whatever information the Harpies could offer, but she had to make sure they were safe. Her duty to the Commission would never be more important than the lives of innocents.</p><p>Of course, she\u2019d been a diplomat for centuries. A small amount of truth was often preferable to a full disclosure.</p><p>\u201cThe vampire you refer to is a traitor to his people and a servant of the Dark Lord,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI traveled here to make sure he faces punishment for his crimes.\u201d</p><p>Solaris emptied her glass before setting it aside. \u201cA convenient claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only give you my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what of his strange abilities?\u201d the Harpy demanded, her voice thickening with a dangerous power. \u201cDo you want me to believe they come from his worship of the Dark Lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what strange abilities you\u2019re referring to.\u201d</p><p>Solaris\u2019s wings gave an impatient flap. \u201cHis ability to infect others with his bite.\u201d</p><p>Nefri frowned, not having to pretend her confusion. She expected claims of brutal killings or missing younglings. Not . . . infections.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fully understand. What do you mean by infecting others?\u201d</p><p>The Harpy studied her with a piercing gaze, perhaps seeking some sign that Nefri was lying. Then, with a powerful stride she was headed toward a door hidden behind one of the tapestries. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>Nefri followed behind Solaris, startled to discover herself being led through a steel-lined corridor that opened into a large room filled with a number of high-tech computers and surveillance equipment.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea that Harpies built such elaborate nests,\u201d she murmured as Solaris paused before a heavy door, using a key card to trip the lock.</p><p>The last Harpy nest that Nefri had entered had been little more than a few walls and a thatch roof.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had to keep up with technology, although there are still matriarchies who prefer to live in a more primitive environment,\u201d she said, leading Nefri down another corridor, this one lined with doors.</p><p>A glance through one open door was enough to reveal they\u2019d reached the prisons.</p><p>\u201cIs Santiago being held in these cells?\u201d she demanded, uncertain why Solaris had brought her here.</p><p>Solaris glanced over her shoulder. \u201cOf course not. For now he\u2019s a guest and being offered our finest hospitality.\u201d A taunting smile touched her lips. \u201cHappy?\u201d</p><p>Well aware that Harpy hospitality included food, drink, and sex with a willing female, Nefri was forced to swallow a low growl. \u201cNot particularly,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Coming to a halt at a door being guarded by an older Harpy with a hard face and the air of a seasoned warrior, Solaris gestured toward the small window set in the steel door.</p><p>With a frown Nefri moved forward, studying the gaunt human male who was pacing the cell with short, jerky steps. He looked young, perhaps twenty, dressed in filthy jeans and a Polo shirt that was torn and covered in blood. His hair was matted with dirt and his face shredded by claw marks that Nefri suspected were self-inflicted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A pathetic creature, but what did it have to do with her? She returned her attention to the female at her side. \u201cIs he mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that was all that was wrong with him, I would have killed him the minute he stumbled close to our nest.\u201d Solaris glanced toward the silent guard. \u201cOpen the window.\u201d</p><p>With a grimace the warrior leaned sideways and slid the pane of glass open a few inches. Immediately a choking cloud of . . . aggression\u2014the only word that came to her mind\u2014filled the air.</p> <p>Nefri shuddered, her fangs fully extended and aching for blood. \u201cGood lord,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>Solaris hissed as her muscles tensed and her eyes swirled with the power of an approaching hurricane. \u201cHe was in our territory for less than one day and he triggered a dozen fights that broke out among various demons, including two of my Harpies, and caused an entire pack of hellhounds to turn on one another,\u201d she said between clenched teeth, as vulnerable to the evil in the air as Nefri. \u201cFour of them are dead.\u201d</p><p>Nefri took an instinctive step back. She was close to snapping. \u201cIs he the only one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only one who has survived. We found several corpses that had been drained and two others that looked as if they\u2019d fought to the death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Nefri clenched her hands, her mind clouding with a bloodlust that she hadn\u2019t felt in centuries. \u201cClose the window.\u201d</p> <p>Solaris nodded toward the guard, who hurriedly slammed the glass shut. For a minute there was a heavy silence as each of them struggled to leash the violence that bubbled through their veins.</p><p>At last, giving a low curse, Solaris turned to stab Nefri with a frustrated glare. \u201cAre you prepared to confess what is going on?\u201d</p><p>Nefri gave a slow shake of her head, feeling a stab of betrayal. What had the Commission done?</p><p>This . . . spirit . . . or whatever the hell it was, had been locked behind the Veil for endless centuries and never once had the Oracles warned her that it could be a danger to her people, let alone turn them into savage zombies.</p><p>And now she was learning that Gaius\u2019s bite might actually be infecting humans....</p><p>Holy hell.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Truly,\u201d she told her companion, her expression troubled. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a vampire\u2019s bite causing this reaction in a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you knew something was wrong?\u201d the Harpy pressed.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I had no idea Gaius was causing such damage,\u201d she carefully hedged before turning the conversation away from what brought her to Louisiana. \u201cI felt the lingering consequences of the infection as we were traveling through the swamp. Is it fading?\u201d</p><p>Solaris\u2019s lips thinned, but she allowed herself to be diverted. \u201cYes. Once the human was locked away the hostility began to lessen. Hopefully it will be completely gone by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The words didn\u2019t ease the tight knot of dread in the pit of her stomach, but it did give her hope that if they moved with enough speed they could contain the worst of the plague.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you intend to do with him?\u201d she asked, nodding toward the cell.</p><p>\u201cStudy him for now,\u201d Solaris said with a shrug. \u201cHe\u2019ll be dead in a day or two.\u201d</p><p>Nefri was caught off guard by the blunt announcement. \u201cDead? He\u2019s not ill. At least not physically.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, but he refuses to eat and he continues to damage himself no matter how often we sedate him. He won\u2019t survive for long.\u201d</p><p>Lord, what a mess.</p><p>Nefri pressed a hand to her temple, suddenly aware of her heavy weariness. Dawn was approaching at a rapid rate and she needed to rest and feed to regain her strength.</p><p>\u201cI must speak with the Anasso,\u201d she said, more to herself than the Harpies who eyed her with open suspicion. \u201cHe has to be warned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, will you tell me what is happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I can tell you is that I will do my best to track down Gaius and put an end to his contamination,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Solaris arched a brow. \u201cAnd if I decide I wish to keep an insurance policy until I can be certain the vampires clean up their mess?\u201d</p><p>Nefri met the stormy gaze without flinching. She was an ancient clan chief who had faced down the most powerful demons. She didn\u2019t allow herself to be intimidated.</p><p>Not by anyone.</p><p>\u201cThen I would have to confess that it wasn\u2019t Styx who sent me to capture Gaius.\u201d</p><p>Solaris froze. \u201cThen who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Commission.\u201d</p><p>Santiago should have been happy as a freaking lark.</p><p>After being escorted into the Harpy nest, he\u2019d found himself ensconced in a luxurious set of rooms. The large living room had an Oriental flavor with black and gold furnishings and jade figurines set on low lacquer tables. The connecting bedroom shared the Oriental theme, the king-size bed canopied in gold silk and the poofy chaise lounges covered in black satin.</p><p>Even the lavatory was matching in the dramatic color scheme, although he had no idea why women insisted on such elegance in a mere bathroom. Give him a shower and a bar of soap and he was satisfied.</p><p>Not that he didn\u2019t spend several painful minutes imagining Nefri soaking in the marble tub that was deep enough to drown in and surrounded by a dozen different oils, soaps, and shampoos.</p><p>Oh, the things he could do to that female in that tub . . . her raven hair floating on the water and her lips parted in astonished pleasure as he knelt between her thighs.</p><p>It was the scent of female Harpy that pulled him out of his fantasies and back into the living room to discover Charis had returned, a smile of invitation on her beautiful face and her lean body still naked.</p><p>\u201cHello, gorgeous,\u201d she purred, leaning against the edge of a sofa so her pale wings could contrast with the dark material and the arch in her back could emphasize her full breasts.</p><p>Never let it be said a Harpy didn\u2019t know how to flaunt her assets.</p><p>\u201cHave you come to release me?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She pouted, giving a toss of her dark curls. \u201cDon\u2019t you like our little nest?\u201d</p><p>Santiago swallowed his impatience. The female looked harmless, but one misspoken word and he\u2019d find himself being roasted by a barrage of fireballs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always delighted to be in the company of beautiful women.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cHow beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs beautiful as a freshly bloomed orchid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to touch?\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted. The female couldn\u2019t know how much her simple question troubled him. She was tender, exquisite, and oozing with sexual invitation. Only a eunuch wouldn\u2019t want to toss her on the sofa and give in to temptation.</p><p>But his body remained stubbornly indifferent to the pleasures the woman had on offer, his fangs refusing to lengthen, and his cock unimpressed. Instead, he was wracked by a compulsive need to find Nefri and make sure she hadn\u2019t been hurt.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have time to enjoy the delights of Harpy hospitality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Your female is busy with the Matron.\u201d Abruptly straightening, Charis strolled toward him, running a finger down the line of her throat. \u201cAnd I brought you dinner.\u201d</p><p>His short burst of laughter held no humor. \u201cIt looks delicious, of course, and I can\u2019t express how desperately I wish I wanted a sip or two.\u201d</p><p>She halted, her brow furrowing in confusion. \u201cAren\u2019t you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy appetite seems to have become extremely selective,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>The gray eyes flashed with anger, but Harpies had rigid rules of protocol and Charis had been well trained. \u201cVery well,\u201d she conceded defeat. \u201cIf you would prefer another female, that can be arranged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would prefer to return to my companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019re not mated.\u201d</p><p>He shivered at the mere thought. This . . . obsession with her was bad enough. How much worse would it be if they were actually mated?</p><p>Mierda.</p><p>Aware that the Harpy was waiting for his response, he managed a thin smile. \u201cI\u2019ve pledged to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in no immediate danger,\u201d Charis said, her expression petulant. \u201cAnd she won\u2019t be leaving until we\u2019re satisfied she isn\u2019t responsible for the nasty humans invading our lands.\u201d</p><p>Santiago\u2019s irritation was replaced by a sharp curiosity. This had to be the reason they\u2019d been forced to the Harpy nest. \u201cNasty humans?\u201d</p><p>Charis wrinkled her nose. \u201cThey carry violence with them, infecting the entire area with their madness.\u201d</p><p>Hmmm. He folded his arms over his chest. \u201cWhy do you think Nefri or I might be involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Matron hasn\u2019t shared her suspicions with the younger warriors, but the humans were bitten by two fangs. Most of us assumed it was a vampire who infected them.\u201d She sent him a questioning gaze. \u201cWhat else could it be?\u201d</p><p>Gaius. It had to be.</p><p>He could feel it in his very bones.</p><p>\u201cYes, what else,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cCan we play now?\u201d</p><p>Santiago barely noticed as Charis moved close enough to tug the leather band from his hair, allowing it to spill down his back. He was far more interested in the scent of jasmine and feminine power that sliced through him like a bolt of lightning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly the hunger that Charis hadn\u2019t been able to stir was charging through him at full throttle, hardening and lengthening his body in all the right places.</p><p>Hiding a smile of anticipation, he covertly watched as Nefri strolled into the room, her body stiffening at the sight of the young Harpy running her fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cMaybe later,\u201d he murmured softly, gently dislodging her fingers and pushing her away. \u201cCan we have some privacy, Charis?\u201d</p> <p>With yet another toss of her head, Charis headed toward the door, pausing to send a flirtatious smile over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the common rooms if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Waiting until the Harpy had disappeared down the hallway, Nefri offered Santiago a smile frigid enough to give him frostbite. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let me interrupt.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched, his eyes running a slow survey down her rigid body. Even with her jeans covered in swamp muck and her hair tangled, she appeared as regally beautiful as always.</p><p>Perhaps it wasn\u2019t so shocking that no other woman could satisfy him. None could possibly compare to this magnificent female.</p><p>\u201cJealous, querida?\u201d he taunted, moving to stand directly in front of her.</p> <p>\u201cTired,\u201d she corrected him, clearly hoping that he didn\u2019t notice the way her dark eyes dilated with arousal. \u201cThe Matron has kindly extended an invitation for us to remain within her nest until nightfall.\u201d</p><p>He was instantly distracted. \u201cInvitation or command?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not prisoners if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking, but dawn is less than an hour away.\u201d She gave a dismissive lift of one shoulder. \u201cIt seemed preferable to remain here than to risk being caught without a suitable place to rest.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve come to discuss your decisions with your partner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you prefer to leave I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, like that was ever going to happen. Not until he had fulfilled his promise to Styx, and more importantly, not until he had this aggravating female well and truly out of his system.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I want is an explanation for why the Harpies believe the vampires are infecting the humans.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw clenched at his smooth attack, but astonishingly she didn\u2019t try to pretend she didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. In fact, she met his gaze squarely. \u201cNot vampires,\u201d she said. \u201cGaius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I witnessed the human. He\u2019s . . .\u201d Her words broke off with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s what?\u201d</p><p>She took a few seconds to answer, her composure a brittle facade that was clearly about to shatter. Santiago resisted the urge to tug her into his arms and offer her comfort. Not only was she more likely to slug him as thank him for his efforts, but he needed to know just what the hell was going on.</p><p>\u201cHe carries violence with him like a plague,\u201d she at last admitted.</p><p>\u201cDid you know this was possible?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she denied, her sincerity unmistakable. \u201cBut we must warn Styx. He\u2019ll need to send his Ravens to track down any infected humans and contain them.\u201d</p><p>He made a sound of disbelief. People accused him of being arrogant? He was an amateur compared to Nefri.</p><p>\u201cYou expect the Anasso to send his personal guard to clean up a mess that the Oracles specifically told him was none of his business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He gave a rueful shake of his head. There was no point in arguing. Styx would agree that the humans had to be halted before they could cause chaos.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you intend to do?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cFind Gaius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his companion?\u201d</p><p>Her expression gave nothing away. \u201cIf he has one.\u201d</p><p>Santiago gave a low hiss. Not just at her refusal to admit exactly what they were facing, but at the growing fear that they were all stumbling in the dark.</p><p>Including the Commission.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this.\u201d</p><p>She gave a weary shake of her head, stepping around him without warning to move toward the back of the room. \u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p><p>With a swift motion he was blocking her path, ignoring the burst of her icy annoyance that crawled over his bare skin, just a breath from true pain.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI intend to have a shower and then rest for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>His earlier fantasies of Nefri in the black and gold bathroom consumed his thoughts, instantly making him as hard as a rock.</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the only guest room available.\u201d Her head was held at a proud angle, but she couldn\u2019t disguise her reaction to his blatant arousal. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShare?\u201d He chuckled in wicked anticipation.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Nefri sniffed at her companion\u2019s male pleasure, pretending as if she hadn\u2019t been the one to insist that she share a room with Santiago.</p><p>Why give him the satisfaction of knowing she couldn\u2019t bear the thought of him in another woman\u2019s arms while she spent the day alone and aching with unfulfilled desire?</p><p>Besides, she hadn\u2019t actually lied.</p><p>These were the only guest rooms, although Solaris had offered to have one of the numerous bedrooms belonging to the Harpies cleared for her use. It was ridiculous to put the younglings out of their own beds.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Turning her head, she avoided the dark promise smoldering in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cCan you contact Styx or would you prefer that I speak with him?\u201d she asked, her tone brisk.</p><p>He reached to smooth a strand of hair behind her ear, his fingers lingering against her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>She shivered beneath his soft caress, a tingling excitement racing through her blood. Oh . . . heavens. It had been so long. So insanely long.</p><p>And now the desire that she\u2019d kept locked away for more years than she could remember threatened to turn into an avalanche.</p><p>Too fast, a voice whispered in the back of her mind. This is all going too fast.</p><p>\u201cThen if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll use the shower first,\u201d she said in a sudden rush. \u201cOnce I\u2019m done you can have the bedroom and I\u2019ll use the couch.\u201d</p><p>His grin widened as he stepped back and waved a hand toward the connecting door. \u201cIt\u2019s all yours, cara.\u201d</p><p>Jackass.</p><p>She swept regally out of the room and crossed directly to enter the large bathroom.</p><p>He\u2019d sensed her growing desire. Just as he sensed the flare of panic at allowing herself to be consumed by the unfamiliar sensations.</p><p>And he found it . . . amusing.</p><p>Amusing.</p><p>She closed the door with emphasis (it wasn\u2019t a slam, dammit) and stripped off her nasty clothes, dropping them into the laundry chute.</p><p>Why? Of all the endless males in the world, why was it Santiago who set her on fire?</p><p>He was stubborn and arrogant and maddeningly impulsive and . . . so deliciously gorgeous and unapologetically male she didn\u2019t have a chance in hell of resisting, she grudgingly admitted, stepping into the shower and turning on the water.</p><p>In the distance she could hear the muffled sound of Santiago\u2019s voice as he spoke on his cell phone, relaying what he\u2019d learned to the Anasso.</p><p>Styx would no doubt be aggravated by her refusal to confess all that she knew, but he would do his duty. It\u2019s what a leader did, no matter what their personal feelings.</p><p>Stepping beneath the flow of warm water, Nefri thankfully washed away the clinging stench of the swamp, shampooing her long hair before reaching for the soap. Just as her fingers closed around the bottle, the door to the shower was pulled open and a naked Santiago stepped into the large stall.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d he murmured, easily removing the bottle from her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finished,\u201d Nefri hissed in shock, her gaze lowering against her will to take in Santiago\u2019s hard, perfectly chiseled body.</p><p>Okay, maybe it wasn\u2019t entirely against her will, she admitted with a jolt of excitement.</p><p>He was . . . magnificent.</p><p>Like an exquisite work of art.</p><p>The water poured over his bronzed skin, plastering the long raven hair to the smooth muscles of his chest and glistening on the lean beauty of his face.</p><p>How was she supposed to resist the temptation to run her fingers, and then her lips, down that sleek male form?</p><p>Easily scenting her sharp burst of arousal, he squeezed a dollop of soap into his palm and smiled with a sinful promise. \u201cGood, then I can wash your back,\u201d he offered.</p><p>She struggled to think clearly. \u201cI can wash my own back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who said we had to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese rooms, not the shower.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cConservation is always a good thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She allowed her gaze to be snared by the dark hunger that smoldered in his eyes. A stupid mistake. Suddenly she understood what it must feel like to drown. The choking heat, the sluggish lack of coordination, the quivering sense something momentous was about to happen.</p><p>And worse, she couldn\u2019t find the intelligence to care.</p><p>\u201cSantiago . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn around, cara,\u201d he prompted, his voice thick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This is dangerous, she told herself. She should shove him away. It wasn\u2019t as if she were some helpless female who didn\u2019t have the strength to take care of herself.</p><p>But for the first time since becoming clan chief, she felt like a woman.</p><p>A woman with needs.</p> <p>A woman who ached for a man\u2019s touch.</p><p>No, she abruptly corrected herself, not just a man\u2019s touch.</p><p>Santiago\u2019s touch.</p><p>Only his.</p><p>Banishing the voice that warned she was about to make a decision that would alter her life forever, Nefri slowly turned, offering him her back.</p> <p>Why shouldn\u2019t she indulge her needs just this once?</p><p>Every other clan chief managed to have a robust sex life and function as a leader. Being a control freak didn\u2019t mean she had to take a vow of chastity.</p><p>Did it?</p><p>\u201cAh, the mark of C\u00fa Chulainn,\u201d he murmured, referring to the tattoo of a dragon that flowed down her back. It revealed that she had gone through the battles of Durotriges to earn the title of master. Clan chief. \u201cVery sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexy?\u201d She frowned. Most vampires found the mark a source of intimidation, not arousal.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Nefri,\u201d Santiago murmured, his lips tracing the outline of the tattoo even as his clever fingers began to soap her back. \u201cI promise this is going to be magic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMagic?\u201d She closed her eyes, forcing her rigid muscles to ease. \u201cAre you always so confident in your ability to please a woman?\u201d</p><p>His lips shifted to the base of her neck, his hands skimming down the curve of her waist.</p><p>\u201cConfident in us,\u201d he corrected her, his fangs scraping over her tender skin. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t feel the explosive chemistry between us. It\u2019s . . . magic. There\u2019s no other word.\u201d</p><p>She made a choked sound, her head tilting to the side in an unspoken invitation.</p><p>It was magic.</p><p>Enchantment at its most primitive level.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been . . . a long time,\u201d she admitted, unsure why she needed him to know.</p><p>\u201cThen let me take care of you,\u201d he whispered against her skin, his hands trailing around her waist before gliding up to cup the fullness of her breasts. \u201cTonight you don\u2019t have to be in charge.\u201d</p> <p>Easy enough for him to say, she wryly conceded. Her need to be in control was a fundamental part of who\u2014</p><p>The thought, in fact all thoughts, were shattered as his thumbs brushed over her straining nipples, sending an electric current of sensation jolting through her.</p><p>Oh lord. Yes. Her toes curled. If this was how he took care of a woman, then she was all for handing him control.</p><p>He kissed a path up the tender curve of her throat, nuzzling below her ear while his fingers continued to torment the sensitive tips of her nipples. The air was filled with cherry-scented steam and raw male desire, wrapping them in a mist of privacy.</p><p>As if they were in their own world, she hazily acknowledged, her hands lifting to steady herself against the black tiles of the shower.</p><p>\u201cThis is dangerous,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he instantly agreed, giving the lobe of her ear a nip before he was stroking his lips downward. \u201cBut inevitable.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps it was, she silently agreed, her back arching as his mouth continued its downward path, following the line of her spine. His touch was cool, but it seemed to brand her skin with fire, making her shudder in pleasure.</p><p>Astonishingly he went to his knees, his hands sliding down her hips before he was firmly tugging her legs apart. Unable to resist temptation, she turned her head to glance over her shoulder, a strange emotion piercing her heart at the sight of the male kneeling behind her, his power barely leashed as he tilted back his head to meet her startled gaze.</p><p>He looked like a pagan god with his stark male beauty, emphasized by the water that shimmered on his bronzed skin.</p><p>Holding her gaze, he leaned forward, using his lips and fangs along the lower curve of her back as he continued to inch her legs further apart.</p><p>A soft moan was torn from her lips. There was something unbearably intimate in watching him pleasure her. As if his touch was reaching someplace deep inside her.</p><p>Nibbling down the curve of her hip, he made a sound deep in his throat as he at last reached the smooth skin of her inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cDeliciosa,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou taste of sweet jasmine.\u201d</p><p>It was the sensation of his lips moving against her most responsive flesh that made her eyes slide shut in sinful pleasure. She hissed, her knees going weak. This was so good. Exactly what she\u2019d been craving.</p><p>Then, while she was still adjusting to the light caress, his clever tongue was sliding through her tender cleft and the tingles of anticipation became a tidal wave of bliss.</p><p>\u201cSantiago,\u201d she groaned, her forehead pressed against the slick tiles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, cara,\u201d he reassured her, his hands holding her hips steady as he continued his exquisite assault. \u201cLet yourself go.\u201d</p><p>Let yourself go . . .</p><p>Such simple words, but for a woman who maintained a rigid clamp on her every emotion, they were as difficult as telling her to walk into the sunlight.</p><p>Not that Santiago was giving her any option, she acknowledged with a shaken sigh. Prepared for his touch to be as hard and demanding as he was, she was caught off guard when the stroke of his tongue was a soft, seeking exploration. She quivered, her fingers digging into the tile.</p><p>Holy hell. This was . . . indecent. And so wickedly wonderful she couldn\u2019t remember why she thought this would be a bad idea.</p><p>His tongue found the tiny bundle of nerves and her head tilted back as his steady licks sent a blaze of arousal through her body.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a force in this world would make me stop,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Thank the gods. Her fangs lengthened and her entire body bowed as his soft strokes quickened, his hands firmly holding her in place.</p><p>Distantly she was aware of the warm cascade of water and the feel of Santiago\u2019s power stirring the thick air. And if she tried hard enough she could sense each and every Harpy as they moved through the large building. But at the moment her only interest was in the acute pleasure that was rapidly spiraling toward an explosion she wasn\u2019t sure she was going to survive.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>She moaned softly, hanging on the cusp. She needed . . .</p><p>He shifted his head just a fraction, changing the pressure of his tongue. Yes. That was it. The small movement was enough to send her hurtling over the edge, and with a cry of sheer pleasure she crushed the tiles beneath her hands.</p><p>Her entire body shook at the force of her climax, leaving her feeling oddly dazed.</p><p>Which was the only reason she allowed Santiago to scoop her in his arms and carry her out of the bathroom, she assured herself.</p><p>No matter how great the sex, she would never, ever be one of those females who liked being treated like a fragile flower.</p><p>Ignoring the water that dripped from their bodies, Santiago crossed to the large bed, lowering her into the middle of the mattress with a powerful ease.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a mermaid,\u201d he murmured, his eyes dark with a smoldering hunger as they swept down her naked body. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve never seen one so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cMermaids are a myth.\u201d</p><p>He moved onto the mattress to kneel next to her, his full arousal standing at attention. Her hands itched to grasp that proud length, exploring it from its broad head to the base.</p><p>\u201cMost people assume that the Immortal Ones are a myth,\u201d he reminded her with a taunting smile. \u201cEspecially their mysterious leader, Nefri.\u201d</p><p>It was true that her people had remained in peaceful isolation for centuries, and that their occasional visits to this world had been done in secret, but . . .</p><p>But what?</p><p>She was finding it increasingly difficult to think as he leaned over her, his hands planted on the mattress next to her shoulders and his shaft pressing against her hip.</p><p>She might have just enjoyed a mind-blowing orgasm, but clearly her body wasn\u2019t opposed to round two.</p><p>Or three.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no myth,\u201d she at last managed to mutter.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d A lethal smile curved his lips. \u201cMaybe I should discover for myself.\u201d</p><p>Always a man of action, he leaned down and allowed his mouth to skim over the curve of her breast.</p><p>She trembled at the teasing caress, needing more. Much more.</p><p>\u201cSantiago,\u201d she pleaded softly.</p><p>\u201cYes, querida.\u201d</p><p>Closing his lips over the tip of her nipple, he used his tongue to tease her sated body back into full arousal. Without hesitation she lifted her arms, shoving her fingers into the tempting silk of his hair.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted to do this since the moment she caught sight of this gorgeous vampire, she realized with a faint stab of surprise. To loosen the long strands of his raven hair and allow it to slide through her fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The revealing words slipped past her lips before she could stop them, but instead of the smug smile she expected, Santiago lifted his head to regard her with a fierce need that stripped away any pretense that this was just lust.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what was happening between the two of them, but one night of madness wasn\u2019t going to satisfy it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI need you to find me beautiful, querida,\u201d he rasped. \u201cI need you to hunger for me with the same insanity that plagues me.\u201d</p><p>Not giving her a chance to respond, he shifted to cover her with the cool weight of his body, his head swooping down to claim her lips in a searing kiss.</p><p>An exquisite shudder shook her body. Insanity summed it up nicely.</p> <p>But sometimes a woman had to toss aside logic and let the magic consume her.</p><p>As if sensing her reckless thoughts, Santiago growled low in his throat, his hands molding the soft curve of her breast as he spread frantic kisses over her face.</p><p>\u201cJasmine and midnight silk,\u201d he muttered, his tongue outlining her lips. \u201cYou were sent here for me to devour.\u201d</p><p>Nefri might have protested if his hand hadn\u2019t trailed down to stroke between her thighs with experienced ease.</p><p>She moaned as his finger slid into her tight flesh, her back arching in growing pleasure.

Her patience was legendary. She\u2019d spent over a century cataloguing every plant that could grow beyond the Veil where the sunlight never pierced the thick mists. But how the hell was she supposed to be patient when her entire body was on fire?</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be patient. She just wanted to once again feel that glorious release that hovered just out of reach.</p><p>Fisting her fingers in his thick hair, she lifted her hips and wrapped her legs around his waist. \u201cThe time is now,\u201d she informed him.</p><p>Pulling back, he regarded her with a rueful smile. \u201cAlways so bossy.\u201d</p> <p>She deliberately rubbed herself against the straining length of his erection. \u201cIf you wanted submissive you should have went with Charis.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened, his fangs long and lethal in the dim lamplight. \u201cWhat I want is you.\u201d Holding her gaze, he shifted until the tip of his cock pressed against her entrance. \u201cOnly you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed.\u201d</p><p>With a low hiss, Santiago tilted his hips forward, sliding into her with a slow, relentless thrust.</p><p>Lowering her hands, Nefri clutched at Santiago\u2019s shoulders, moaning in approval at the delicious sense of fullness. In this moment they were joined as deeply as it was possible for two people to be joined.</p><p>As lovers . . .</p><p>Her mind instantly shied from the implied relationship.</p> <p>\u201cNefri,\u201d he whispered close to her ear. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she muttered, burying her face in the curve of his neck to absorb the rich male scent of him. \u201cNothing at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen hang on, querida.\u201d</p><p>The words had barely left his lips when he was pulling out and thrusting forward with enough force to bang the bed against the wall. Her eyes squeezed shut. Santiago\u2019s tenderness had been a delightful surprise, but this was . . .</p><p>This was the raw, aching sex her body had longed for. This was perfection.</p><p>Meeting him thrust for thrust, Nefri scored her nails down his back, digging them into the firm muscles of his butt. He made a choked sound of pleasure, his lips finding hers in a kiss that demanded utter surrender.</p><p>\u201cDios, I\u2019ve waited so long.\u201d</p><p>She nipped at his lips, her fangs careful not to break his skin.</p><p>Vampires mated by exchanging blood.

Which meant he wasn\u2019t surprised when he stepped into the long room that was lined by ceiling-high bookshelves to discover Styx\u2019s Ravens gathered.</p><p>A mocking smile curved his lips as he leaned against the doorjamb and surveyed the collection of massive vampires who were draped on the delicate Louis XIV chairs and sofas. They looked like oversized G.I. Joe action figures stuck in a miniature dollhouse.</p><p>\u201cA powwow and you didn\u2019t invite me?\u201d Roke drawled as the vampires turned to regard him with varying degrees of impatience to downright irritation. He hadn\u2019t made any effort to win friends and influence people since being forced to remain in Chicago. \u201cI\u2019m crushed.\u201d</p><p>As if sensing that Roke was frustrated enough to pick a fight just to have a reason to hit someone, Styx crossed the room with long strides and stood directly in front of him, blocking his path. \u201cSantiago called just before dawn,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ah. Roke had heard the stirrings as he\u2019d lain down to rest for the day, but it had been too late to seek out the cause.</p><p>\u201cIt must have been a helluva call for you to summon the A-team from their gargoyle duty.\u201d He sent a taunting glance toward the larger-than-usual vampire with a long blond braid and fierce blue eyes. Jagr had recently become the official leader of the Ravens. \u201cIs the world coming to an end?\u201d</p><p>The vampire stepped forward, looking every inch the Visigoth warrior he\u2019d once been. \u201cNo, but your end can be easily arranged, Tonto,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Roke snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a village to plunder, Goth-boy?\u201d</p><p>Styx allowed his power to slice through the air with an icy edge. The surrounding vampires flinched in pain.</p><p>Clearly the Anasso was in a mood.</p><p>\u201cJagr, I\u2019ll leave it to you to arrange the patrols. Make sure no one goes alone,\u201d he commanded, his dark gaze never wavering from Roke. \u201cYou, come with me.\u201d</p><p>Not giving Roke an option, Styx grabbed him by the upper arm and led him down the marble hallway. They halted on the landing of the wide staircase.</p><p>Roke pulled free of his companion\u2019s grasp, studying Styx\u2019s tense features. \u201cIs Santiago in trouble?\u201d he abruptly demanded.</p><p>The older vampire grimaced. \u201cSantiago spends his life skirting on the edge of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should have asked if he was in more trouble than usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, his call was concerning Gaius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems the bastard has acquired a nasty new talent.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound good.</p><p>\u201cShould I ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSantiago claims that his former sire is capable of infecting humans with his bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInfecting them with what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolence.\u201d</p><p>Roke frowned. Was this some sort of joke? \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either, but I\u2019m sending out scouts to make sure we prevent any unwelcome surprises,\u201d Styx muttered.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d Roke pounced on the excuse to escape the lair. \u201cSign me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you.\u201d Styx swiftly shut him down. \u201cI need you to stay here.\u201d</p><p>Roke barely swallowed his growl of annoyance. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving in a few minutes to try and gain an audience with the Oracles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Roke prompted.</p><p>Styx shrugged, his expression guarded. \u201cAnd I need you to protect the lair.\u201d</p><p>Roke was getting a bad feeling about this.</p><p>A very bad feeling.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to keep an eye on our guest.\u201d</p><p>Shit, he knew it.</p><p>\u201cThe witch?\u201d he ground out.</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019ve added to our collection in the dungeons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I?\u201d He planted his hands on his hips, glaring at the older vampire. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take care of the one we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only until we\u2019ve discovered what the hell is going on with Gaius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy?\u201d Styx met him glare for glare. \u201cWould you rather go speak with the Oracles?\u201d</p><p>Oh . . . hell, no.</p><p>Not that he was about to admit as much to the towering Aztec in front of him. \u201cYou know what I want,\u201d he instead snapped.</p><p>Styx paused, studying Roke with a piercing intelligence. \u201cIs there something going on with this witch I should know about?\u201d</p><p>Roke clenched his hands. What was there to know about? That he\u2019d spent the daylight hours plagued by the thought of warm ivory skin and glorious autumn hair that smelled of peaches? That he\u2019d had to force his feet to carry him to the library rather than heading down to the dungeons? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot a damned thing,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Styx lifted a brow, but he was smart enough to keep his opinion to himself. \u201cGood, then I want you to question her again,\u201d he said. \u201cSee if she knows anything about the supposed infection that Gaius is spreading.\u201d</p><p>Roke was shaking his head before Styx was done. \u201cGet someone else. She won\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</p> <p>Styx leaned forward, the air taking on a distinct chill of irritation. \u201cThen make her talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for Christ\u2019s sake. I don\u2019t torture helpless females locked in my dungeons.\u201d Styx shook his head, the tiny turquoise amulets threaded through his long braid tinkling at the movement. \u201cI meant charm. You do remember how to seduce a young, beautiful woman, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A combustible heat scalded through his lower body, assuring Roke that he remembered in exquisite detail how to seduce a beautiful woman, even if it had been far too long since he\u2019d felt like indulging in it.</p><p>Until now.</p> <p>Dangerous.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a woman, she\u2019s a witch,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cChrist. Fine,\u201d Styx snapped in exasperation. \u201cI\u2019ll send Spike to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roke interrupted before he could halt the harsh words. There was no way Spike was getting anywhere close to Sally. The younger vampire would have her flat on her back and his fangs deep in her throat before she knew what was happening. And that was . . . unacceptable. Why? That was a question he didn\u2019t intend to answer. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the witch.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Harpy house in Louisiana</p> <p>Santiago woke with every expectation of finding Nefri in his arms.</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>They\u2019d come together in an earth-shattering explosion of pleasure. More than once. The sort of pleasure that made lovers want to linger in bed and explore one another for hours. Days. Perhaps centuries.</p><p>Instead Nefri was not only out of bed, but she\u2019d showered and changed into a pair of clean jeans and a pale blue sweater that she must have gotten from the Harpies. More telling, she was putting off vibes that warned she wasn\u2019t in a hurry to leap back into bed.</p><p>With a grimace, Santiago headed into the shower, not surprised to discover a pair of jeans and sweatshirt waiting for him on the counter.</p><p>If Nefri didn\u2019t need him to track down Gaius she would no doubt have escaped while he was sleeping. As it was, she was doing everything in her power to make sure he understood that last night (or rather early this morning) was a mistake.</p><p>One she didn\u2019t intend to repeat.</p><p>Not that he was about to be tossed into the pile of Nefri\u2019s bad decisions, he grimly decided, stepping beneath the hot water.</p> <p>She\u2019d been with him all the way.</p><p>Hell, she\u2019d nearly shredded his back during their last delectable tango.</p><p>A shudder raced through his body at the vivid memory of Nefri spread beneath him, her eyes dark with a passion that threatened to drown them both.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t over.</p><p>Not by a long shot.</p><p>Swiftly washing his hair and skimming the soap over his body, he exited the shower and dried off. Then, taking time to pull on the jeans and black sweatshirt, he braided his hair, and headed out of the bathroom.</p><p>The bedroom was empty. No surprise there. But the tidal wave of her power assured him she hadn\u2019t gone far.</p><p>He stepped into the living room, his brows lifting at the sight of Nefri seated cross-legged in the middle of the floor, her eyes closed and her hands folded in her lap as her hair floated on the faint breeze stirred by her powers.</p><p>At his entrance, her lashes lifted to reveal eyes that were carefully devoid of emotion.</p><p>\u201cMeditation?\u201d he drawled, trying to keep his temper in check. Not easy when she was studying him like he was a virus that had to be endured for the greater good.</p><p>\u201cIt clears my mind,\u201d she said, smoothly rising to her feet.</p><p>He snorted, not fooled for a second. A vampire didn\u2019t use that amount of power to find their inner self.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were hoping to contact the Oracles?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cIf only you were as clever as you think you are.\u201d</p><p>He slowly paced to stand mere inches from her. \u201cI\u2019m not only as clever as I think I am, but I\u2019m even better looking.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back before she could hide her revealing retreat. Then, squaring her shoulders, she forced herself to meet his wicked grin. \u201cDid you convince Styx to send out his Ravens?\u201d</p><p>His gaze lowered to the lush red lips, a ready heat spreading through his body. Oh, the havoc those lips could wreak.</p><p>\u201cOnce I assured him the gargoyle was no longer missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStyx was concerned about Levet?\u201d she asked in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cNot Styx. Darcy,\u201d he corrected her. \u201cLike me, the Anasso couldn\u2019t care less if the aggravating pest stayed absent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The cool composure slammed back into place. \u201cI\u2019ve already had word that he\u2019s waiting for us just north of here.\u201d She waved her hand toward the glass of blood that was set on the low table. \u201cYou should eat so we can join him.\u201d</p><p>He crossed to lift the glass to his lips, draining it in one long swallow.</p><p>It held the rich flavor of Harpy, but it wasn\u2019t the jasmine-scented blood he longed for. Still, it replenished his strength. Anything else would obviously have to wait.</p><p>Replacing the empty glass on the table, he turned back to study his companion. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to join me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI need very little sustenance.\u201d</p><p>Hmmm. Interesting. Santiago had heard rumors that there were those behind the Veil who abstained completely from blood. Just another way to make themselves superior to their more savage brethren, he wryly assumed.</p><p>\u201cBecause of your age or because of your time behind the Veil?\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly polite to discuss a woman\u2019s age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so secretive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen answer the question. Do you feed?\u201d</p><p>Something that was almost an emotion flared through her eyes before it was ruthlessly squashed. \u201cNot when I\u2019m with my clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s true that the Veil steals all hunger?\u201d</p><p>Her jaw clenched. He knew she hated being questioned almost as much as she hated revealing anything about the mysteries beyond the Veil. Thankfully she\u2019d learned that he was just as stubborn as she was.</p><p>\u201cIt diminishes the more primitive needs,\u201d she admitted in clipped tones.</p><p>\u201cAnd passions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor most.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. Endless nights without desire or hunger or pleasure?</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would anyone choose to live there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are those of us who have interests beyond physical satisfaction,\u201d she informed him with an edge of censure.</p><p>Ah. A challenge. He returned his attention to the temptation of her lips as he moved to stand close enough to be wrapped in her jasmine scent. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be said for physical satisfaction,\u201d he reminded her in a husky voice.</p><p>She stiffened, but held her ground. \u201cAnd even more to be said for the powers that come from abstinence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat powers?\u201d he swiftly pounced.</p><p>She abruptly turned away, heading toward the door. \u201cIf you\u2019re finished we should go.\u201d</p><p>He moved to stand in her path. \u201cWhat powers?\u201d</p><p>A burst of frigid energy lashed against him, just a small taste of her displeasure.</p><p>Damn. Why was that so sexy?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you before that the talents of vampires are as varied behind the Veil as they are in this world.\u201d</p><p>He pretended that he didn\u2019t notice the tightness of her features that warned he was wearing on her last nerve. Unless he pushed the issue he would never truly discover the woman beneath the clan chief.</p><p>And he wanted that.</p><p>With a brutal need that was more than a little frightening.</p><p>\u201cI know there\u2019s shape-shifting and mist-walking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the ability to pass as human?\u201d he asked, referring to the rumors that there were vampires who could feign breathing, a heartbeat, and even warm their skin.</p><p>\u201cFor a rare few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDay-walkers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven fewer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDios.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to hide his surprise. He hadn\u2019t truly believed it was possible. \u201cCan you walk in the daylight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong ago I could endure the sun for very limited periods of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my visits have become more frequent to this world,\u201d she said, her composure a brittle shell. \u201cIt steals my abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy have they been more frequent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was an . . . incident two centuries ago that I had to handle and more recently I devoted my attention to searching for the prophet.\u201d Her dark gaze shifted toward the door, her profile rigid. \u201cI had hoped that once the Dark Lord was defeated I would be allowed to return to my studies.\u201d</p><p>Santiago scowled, disgruntled by her regret. It appeared painfully genuine. Was this a warning that her place was firmly behind the Veil? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And if it was, how could he argue?</p><p>She was a clan chief.

You wanted to flee behind your Veil and pretend you hadn\u2019t lusted after a mere savage,\u201d he clarified.</p><p>With a cool glare she moved around his stiff form, her head held high. \u201cWe\u2019re wasting time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cS\u00ed,\u201d he hissed, not sure if he was more annoyed with her or himself for caring that she was eager to leave him behind. \u201cWe clearly have better things to be doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSantiago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Gaius\u2019s lair in Wisconsin</p><p>Gaius returned from searching the thick woods for any sign of intruders to discover Dara standing on the bottom of the stairs. With her hand on the wood banister and her dark hair floating on an invisible breeze, she appeared to be more a specter than a flesh and blood woman.</p><p>A part of him longed to rush across the narrow space to wrap her fragile form in the protection of his arms. A greater part, however, kept him standing frozen in the doorway.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing out of bed, beloved?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>A pout marred her perfect face. \u201cMy dinner is dead.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only brought me three and one escaped.\u201d</p><p>Escaped. It took long minutes for the word to sink through his sluggish brain. Then he was clenching his hands in weary frustration.</p><p>Dio.</p><p>This was how it started in Louisiana. One and then two survivors escaping to stir the locals into a panic. He couldn\u2019t allow it to happen again.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must track him down.\u201d</p><p>Dara lifted a slender shoulder. \u201cWhy bother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he could lead the humans to us,\u201d he said, barely able to contain his rising irritation. The last thing he desired was spending the rest of the night trailing the stupid human.</p><p>He wanted . . . what? A few hours of peace, he abruptly realized. A chance to relax and enjoy the return of his mate without the constant need to tend to her hungers.</p><p>\u201cNo one would believe him,\u201d she sought to assure him, floating forward.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cNo, habibi.\u201d Her voice was surprisingly commanding, the dark eyes holding his gaze with a hypnotic power. \u201cAllow him to return to the village. He will seed our garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeed our garden?\u201d he parroted.</p><p>With a slender wave of her hand, Dara pushed open the nearest windows, a coy smile curving her lips.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you feel it, Gaius?\u201d She shivered with delight at the strange sense of lust that pulsed in the air. \u201cOur time has arrived.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Styx\u2019s lair in Chicago</p><p>Roke headed down the stairs as Styx returned to his waiting Ravens.</p><p>\u201cCharming,\u201d he muttered as he reached the lower floor. \u201cI\u2019d like to shove a charming fist right into his smug face.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he was arrogant enough to assume that the Anasso was deliberately trying to piss him off. It was obvious that Styx had his hands full with this latest threat. Still, he wasn\u2019t pleased to be back on witch duty.</p><p>He was supposed to be devoting this night to scrubbing away every thought of Sally Grace. Not giving his overactive libido even more reason to plague his day with erotic dreams.</p><p>Muttering a string of curses, Roke was only vaguely aware of his surroundings. Which explained why he\u2019d nearly missed the male fairy who was hurrying down the hallway with a tray of food, along with a rose and several leather-bound books.</p><p>Roke came to a sharp halt, knowing beyond a doubt the overly pretty demon was rushing to be with Sally. Who else would put that smile of anticipation on the narrow face that was surrounded by a tumble of golden hair? Or the eagerness shimmering in the hazel eyes?</p><p>Although there were any number of lovely, not to mention lethal, females scattered around the mansion, most of them were mated. And not even a fairy was stupid enough to try and come between a vampire and his mate.</p><p>Or even a pure-blooded Were for that matter.</p><p>Besides, Roke recognized that vaguely bewildered expression beneath the enchantment.</p><p>That was a Sally Grace specialty.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he called out.</p><p>The fairy came to a reluctant halt, eyeing Roke with impatience. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that tray for the witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the man grudgingly admitted.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me.\u201d Roke held out his hands. Then, when the fairy just stood there staring at him like an idiot, he snapped his fingers. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to bother yourself,\u201d the man said, stubbornly holding on to the tray. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have better things to be doing.\u201d</p><p>Roke leaned forward, his power making the plates rattle. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a suggestion, fairy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive. Me. The. Tray.\u201d As expected the fairy hastily shoved the tray into Roke\u2019s hands, tumbling over the rose and jostling the stack of books. Roke frowned. \u201cWhat the hell is with the books?\u201d</p><p>The fairy hunched a shoulder, his expression petulant. \u201cI promised that I would bring her something to read. She\u2019s bored.\u201d</p><p>Bored? An image of how he could keep the pretty little witch entertained seared through his mind before he managed to slam shut the door on the treacherous temptation.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the damned Ritz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d A hint of eagerness returned to the narrow face. \u201cIn fact I\u2019m happy to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mind,\u201d Roke snapped, infuriated by the man\u2019s obvious obsession with Sally. \u201cYou\u2019re not to return to the dungeons, is that clear?\u201d</p><p>The fairy had the nerve to hesitate, almost as if he was actually considering defying Roke\u2019s command. Suicidal fey. Then, after a long moment, he gave a grudging nod. \u201cIt\u2019s clear.\u201d</p><p>Whirling on his heel, Roke headed toward the nearby stairs that led to the lower level. \u201cFreaking fairies,\u201d he muttered, ignoring the startled glances from the vampires watching the surveillance equipment lining the entrance to the lower dungeons. Waiting for the younger vampire with short, brown hair and dark eyes to jump up and open the heavy steel door, Roke swept past them and headed down the corridor between the cells.</p><p>His knee-high moccasins that were laced over his black jeans made no sound as he ghosted forward. But something must have alerted Sally that she was no longer alone. He was barely halfway down the corridor when he heard her push herself off the cot and cross to the bars of her cell.</p><p>\u201cLysander?\u201d she called softly, the sweet scent of peaches filling the air.</p><p>Roke\u2019s fingers tightened on the tray. Oh . . . hell. What was it about that maddening scent?</p><p>Annoyed as much by his instant, painful arousal as by the sound of another man\u2019s name on her lips, Roke took the last few steps to arrive at her cell. \u201cNo, not Lysander,\u201d he said, watching her expectant expression harden with a flare of obvious frustration.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she breathed, shoving back her tangled curls that glowed with the rich colors of autumn beneath the overhead lights.</p><p>The sort of hair a man wanted brushing against his naked skin.</p><p>\u201cYour pet fairy has resigned his babysitting duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResigned or was fired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your pick.\u201d</p><p>Her hands clenched, her chin tilted to a militant angle. \u201cWhy? I thought we agreed you wouldn\u2019t return.\u201d</p><p>Roke ignored her accusation. He wanted answers on what was going on between her and the fairy. \u201cWhat did you do to that poor man?\u201d</p><p>She stilled, as if she were caught off guard by his question. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was foaming at the mouth to get down here. I thought I was going to have to wrestle him for the honor of bringing your dinner tray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d She licked her lips, her expression suddenly guarded. \u201cHe happens to be a gentleman. Unlike you.\u201d</p><p>Roke studied her pale face. What was she trying to hide? \u201cHow many times has he been down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly once.\u201d She stepped away from the bars, her arms wrapping around her slender waist. \u201cHe came down to ask what I wanted for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in that short time you managed to bewitch him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she denied with more force than was necessary. \u201cI can\u2019t use my magic in this cell.\u201d</p><p>Was she joking?</p><p>His gaze made a reluctant trip over her small form, which was perfectly curved to entice a man\u2019s appetite. It didn\u2019t matter if he was vampire or fey.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more than one kind of magic a female can use to bewitch a male, as you well know,\u201d he growled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was the slightest flicker of her lashes before her guarded expression was being replaced by a mocking smile. \u201cTell me, Roke, do you hate all women, or is it just me?\u201d</p><p>Roke muttered a curse, abruptly recalling Styx\u2019s words: You do remember how to seduce a young, beautiful woman, don\u2019t you . . . ?</p><p>Dammit. He was supposed to be charming the female, not pissing her off.</p> <p>Shifting the tray, he waved a hand in front of the cell door, using his powers to turn the lock. As it swung open he stepped through and closed it behind him with his foot.</p><p>Entering the cell, he moved to set the tray on the narrow cot before straightening to meet her frustrated glare.</p><p>Okay, time to be charming.</p><p>Forcing his muscles to unclench, he strolled forward. \u201cMaybe you could change my opinion,\u201d he murmured, his gaze lowering to the sensual curve of her lips.</p><p>Sally blinked, clearly baffled by his abrupt change. \u201cI don\u2019t care enough to make the effort,\u201d she at last retorted. \u201cI prefer Lysander\u2019s company.\u201d</p> <p>Roke battled back his surge of anger. \u201cForget the fairy,\u201d he warned in soft tones. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously too susceptible to be an adequate guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she demanded. \u201cBecause he didn\u2019t beat me?\u201d</p><p>He hissed, dangerously disturbed by the thought of any man daring to raise a hand to this female. \u201cNo one would dare mar that perfect skin,\u201d he rasped, moving close enough that he could run his fingers down the bare skin of her neck.</p><p>She shivered, her eyes widening. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Fan-fucking-tastic question.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d he muttered, lowering his hands to grasp her arms so he could steer her to the bed. Only when she was perched on the edge of the mattress did he release his hold. \u201cEat while it\u2019s hot.\u201d</p> <p>Rolling her eyes, she reached for a ham sandwich and took a savage bite.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about taking meds for those manic mood swings of yours?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Mood swings? He gave a short, humorless laugh. If she truly understood his current mood she\u2019d be hitting him upside the head with the tray.</p><p>\u201cYou have to admit you haven\u2019t been Miss Sunshine yourself,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cAt least I have a reason for being so surly.\u201d She polished off the sandwich and reached for another. \u201cYou? Not so much.\u201d</p><p>With a brooding gaze he watched her work her way through the food. How the hell did such a tiny female consume so much? Weren\u2019t humans always concerned with calories and fat content and all that crap?</p><p>Not that there was anything wrong with her slender curves, he silently conceded. They were . . . mouthwatering.</p><p>Polishing off the plate of French fries, she lifted her head to meet his unwavering gaze with a frown. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re freaking me out,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes you think I want anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking at me like I was a bug you\u2019re getting ready to squish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bug?\u201d His lips twisted into a wry smile. \u201cYou truly are an innocent if you think that\u2019s why I\u2019m staring.\u201d</p><p>She surged to her feet, clearly sensing his smoldering tension if not the reason behind it. \u201cJust answer the question.\u201d</p><p>He studied her pale face. He logically understood what he was supposed to do.</p><p>Charm her.</p><p>Seduce her.</p><p>Lure her into revealing what she was hiding.</p><p>So, what was the problem?</p><p>He might not be as insatiable as most vampires when it came to sex, but he was more than capable of seducing a female.</p><p>More than capable.</p><p>A teasing smile, a soft confession that he\u2019d been staring at her because she was exquisite. He would gently tuck a strand of satin hair behind her ear and apologize for his rough manners. Perhaps even lead her over to the bed and press one of the ripe strawberries between her lips before urging her back onto the mattress and\u2014</p><p>There.</p><p>That was the problem.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t make a game out of seducing her. Not when the mere thought of running his hands over that pale, peach-scented skin was enough to send him up in flames.</p><p>Shit. If he wanted the truth, he was going to have to find a less perilous means of acquiring it.</p><p>Folding his arms over his chest, he met her wary gaze with a determined expression. If he couldn\u2019t finesse her, he\u2019d out-stubborn her.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you know about Gaius.\u201d</p><p>Predictably she heaved a sigh of resignation. \u201cFor god\u2019s sake, how many times do we have to go through this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I\u2019m convinced you\u2019re telling me everything you know.\u201d</p><p>She threw her hands in the air. \u201cI already have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he always been able to infect humans with his bite?\u201d Roke closely watched the shock that rippled over her pretty face.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. Her astonishment seemed genuine enough. Of course, she might have prepared herself for the question.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe infects humans?\u201d She gave a shake of her head. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a vampire being able to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She gave another shake of her head. \u201cWhat does he infect them with? A disease?\u201d</p><p>He stepped close enough to tower over her, trying to intimidate her at the same time he was futilely pretending her warmth wasn\u2019t seeping into his skin and heating his blood. \u201cYou would know better than I.\u201d</p><p>Waving away his accusation, Sally jerkily turned to pace the small cell, chewing her bottom lip. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you caught him?\u201d</p><p>Roke grimaced. She wasn\u2019t acting. There was no mistaking the fear that was spiking the air. She didn\u2019t know about Gaius\u2019s newest trick.</p><p>Of course, he was still certain she was hiding something from him.</p><p>What better opportunity to discover just what it was?</p><p>\u201cA little nervous, are you, witch?\u201d he murmured. \u201cAfraid that Gaius might suspect you came to Styx to tattle on him? Maybe wondering if he\u2019ll come hunting for you?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d expected her to be worried by his soft words. That\u2019s why he\u2019d chosen them, after all. But he didn\u2019t expect her to freak out.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he will?\u201d she breathed, the pulse at the base of her throat fluttering in terror. Then, with a panicked sob, she was darting toward the cell door, grasping the bars as if she could pull them apart. \u201cDammit, you have to let me out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d he commanded, taken off guard by her violent response. \u201cEven if he did manage to track you here, there\u2019s no way he could get past Styx\u2019s security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a joke?\u201d She tried to shake the locked door. \u201cHe already got past Styx\u2019s supposed security.\u201d</p><p>Roke grimaced. It was true. At least in part. \u201cFine. Then there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll get past me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you would give a shit if he decided to have a little witch snack,\u201d she hissed. \u201cYou would probably cheer him on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to get you. You\u2019re\u2014\u201d He swallowed the word \u201cmine,\u201d which had ridiculously formed on the tip of his tongue.</p><p>Holy hell, he was obviously losing his mind. This female was a pain in the ass who would make a man miserable even if she weren\u2019t a witch. He felt nothing but sympathy for the schmuck who would be stuck with her.</p><p>Didn\u2019t he?</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d</p><p>With a low growl Roke moved forward, grasping her by her upper arms and shifting her away from the door. \u201cI\u2019ll come back for the tray later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d She desperately grasped his T-shirt, her eyes wide with horror. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep me locked up. I\u2019m a sitting duck.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at her pale face, his hands unconsciously skimming down her arms to lightly encircle her wrists.</p><p>Why was she suddenly so frightened of Gaius?</p><p>\u201cThink, Sally,\u201d he urged in stern tones. \u201cWhere would you go where you\u2019d be any safer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stay trapped here,\u201d she snarled. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Roke parted his lips, but before he could demand to know just what was making her act like a crazed woman, he felt a sudden heat explode inside him, scorching through his veins with an incandescent force.</p><p>Oh . . . hell.</p><p>He\u2019d known the witch was going to be trouble.</p><p>He\u2019d known it on a cellular level.</p><p>And now she was killing him.</p><p>Nothing else could explain the sensation of his body being shattered into a thousand pieces as a light as fierce as the midday sun burst in the center of his being, transforming him even as it catapulted him toward the eternal sleep.</p><p>Magic.</p><p>A sweet, drugging magic that allowed him to smile with delight as a tidal wave of darkness crashed over him.</p><p>Sally watched in astonishment as Roke dropped to the floor with enough force to make his head bounce against the cement.</p><p>\u201cCrap on toast, what have I done?\u201d She fell to her knees at his side, her hand reaching to lightly touch his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It had been sheer panic that had released her secret magic. Certainly she hadn\u2019t deliberately tried to enchant this vampire, not when she was convinced that he was too strong to be swayed by her meager powers.</p><p>That was why she was so angry that he\u2019d replaced the fairy. She\u2019d had high hopes of swaying Lysander into setting her free.</p><p>But the fear of being trapped here while Gaius, and whatever strange creature was controlling him, came hunting for her, had tipped her over some mysterious edge.</p> <p>She wouldn\u2019t become a helpless victim.</p><p>Not again.</p><p>Now, she was not only trapped in a cell, but Roke was going to be furious when he came around.</p><p>And worse, she\u2019d revealed that she was more than just a human witch.</p><p>Dammit.</p> <p>Her karma was clearly in need of a good cleansing.</p><p>Almost on cue, Roke\u2019s thick fringe of lashes lifted to reveal the astonishing eyes that were even more pale than usual, the black rim a startling contrast.</p><p>\u201cWhat the . . .\u201d His angry words cut off as he caught sight of Sally bending over him, his expression melting from confused fury to blind adoration. \u201cSally?\u201d</p><p>Oh lord.</p><p>Was it possible?</p><p>Had she actually managed to enchant the mighty vampire?</p> <p>The thought she had succeeded was almost as terrifying as having failed.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d she cautiously inquired.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d A slow smile curved his lips. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She tried to swallow past the lump in her throat. Even consumed by fear, she was nearly blinded by his stark male beauty. The lean, bronzed face with the high cheekbones and chiseled lips. The wide brow and proud nose. The dark hair that held the sheen of silk in the overhead light.</p><p>He looked too perfect to be real.</p><p>At last realizing that she was gawking at him like an idiot, she forced herself to clear her throat. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t feel good?\u201d she managed to rasp.</p><p>\u201cI feel captivated.\u201d Without warning his hands lifted to frame her face, his eyes darkening with an unmistakable hunger. \u201cCome here, my little witch.\u201d</p><p>Before she could react, Sally found herself being tugged downward. Instinctively her lips parted to protest, but the words were lost as Roke claimed her mouth in a kiss of unrelenting possession.</p> <p>Holy shit.</p><p>As their lips met, her heart came to a shuddering halt. It was like being hit with lightning, she fuzzily acknowledged, forgetting to breathe as the shocking pleasure sizzled through her.</p><p>His tongue traced the line of her lower lip, his fingers plunging into her hair as he angled her head to the side.</p><p>\u201cRoke,\u201d she muttered, shivering as his mouth shifted to allow his fangs to scrape along the slender curve of her neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to taste you from the moment I caught sight of you,\u201d he growled, his lips tormenting the pulse at the base of her neck, which was racing out of control. \u201cThis skin . . . as fine as ivory. And your scent of peaches.\u201d His fingers tightened in her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s driving me mad.\u201d</p><p>They were both mad, Sally accepted as she sighed in approval. Or maybe the spell she\u2019d woven around him had somehow caught her in its web.</p><p>In this moment, she didn\u2019t care. She was completely lost in the blissful sensations. How had she ever called this man cold-blooded? His touch was igniting sparks of heat that threatened to consume her.</p><p>It was only the press of his fangs against her flesh that jerked her back to her senses.</p><p>\u201cOh . . . my god . . . no. Wait,\u201d she hissed, pressing her hands against his chest. \u201cNo biting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked softly, his tongue running a path up her throat. \u201cI hunger to taste you.\u201d</p><p>Tantalizing pleasure swept through her. \u201cMmm, yes . . . I mean no.\u201d With a sharp push, she was breaking free of his hypnotizing touch, sitting back on her heels as she pressed a hand to her throat. \u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need my strength,\u201d she said, more to remind herself than to halt Roke. For god\u2019s sake, she was supposed to be escaping from this prison, not drowning in a sensual hunger for the man holding her captive.</p><p>Roke folded his hands beneath his head, regarding her with a sinful smile. \u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, which still tingled from his skillful kiss. \u201cI mean, I need my strength so we can escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEscape?\u201d He slowly sat upright, running a hungry glance down her body. \u201cThe only place we\u2019re going is to my private rooms. The faster the better.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her, but this time Sally was prepared. Scrambling to her feet, she retreated until her back hit the far wall.</p><p>Concentrate, Sally, she warned herself. Concentrate or die.</p><p>\u201cRoke, please, you must listen to me.\u201d</p><p>Regret rippled over his lean face as he rose to his feet, roughly shoving back the thick strands of his hair. \u201cForgive me, my sweet. I\u2019m not usually so lacking in control.\u201d He shook his head, his expression bemused. \u201cYou have bewitched me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got that,\u201d she breathed, guilt piercing her heart.</p><p>This proud warrior was going to hate her when he came to his senses and discovered what she\u2019d done. She didn\u2019t doubt that he would rather die than feel emotions for a skanky witch.</p><p>Of course, he already hated her, she reminded herself. So what did it matter?</p><p>Pretending that it didn\u2019t, she made herself hold her ground as he cautiously approached, as if she were a wild animal he didn\u2019t want to startle. Then, cupping her face in a tender hand, he rubbed a thumb over her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWe can take this as slow as you need,\u201d he promised. \u201cJust so long as we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>It was a spell. The warmth in his eyes. The gentleness of his touch. She knew that better than anyone. So why did it feel so real?</p><p>Crap. She thrust away the ridiculous thought, forcing herself to concentrate on the only thing that mattered.</p><p>Getting the hell out of this cell.</p><p>\u201cYes, but we both know that Styx won\u2019t allow that,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m the enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he denied. \u201cNot the enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why am I being held in this cell?\u201d</p><p>A muscle clenched in his jaw. \u201cI will speak with him. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please, Roke.\u201d She lifted her hands to clutch at his shoulders, her expression openly pleading. \u201cWe have to leave here.\u201d</p><p>He frowned as her magical compulsion clashed with his loyalty to his Anasso. \u201cLeave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way we can be together.\u201d</p><p>Several tense minutes passed before he at last gave a grudging nod of his head. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She released a shaky sigh of relief. \u201cCan you get us out of the dungeons?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s no problem, but we\u2019ll never be able to leave the lair without alerting Styx\u2019s guards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce we\u2019re away from this cell I\u2019ll be able to use my magic,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>There was another pause, then abruptly taking hold of her hand, he pulled her toward the cell door.</p><p>\u201cStay close.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>North of the Louisiana wetlands</p><p>Nefri hid a grimace as they skirted past the small town. The violence that had tainted the air was slowly fading and the residents were gratefully settling in for a peaceful night.</p><p>Unfortunately, the promise of serenity did nothing to end the cold prickles of displeasure that radiated from her companion.</p><p>Santiago was in a crappy mood and he wanted to make sure he shared the misery.</p><p>Not that she was blameless, she ruefully acknowledged.</p><p>She\u2019d been so intent on scurrying back behind her defensive walls that she\u2019d totally forgotten the potency of male pride.</p><p>Santiago wouldn\u2019t consider the idea that her rigid composure might be her way of coping with the overwhelming night of passion. Or that she might not be comfortable with the realization that she\u2019d made herself vulnerable to him in a way she hadn\u2019t for centuries.</p><p>Of course not.</p><p>He was used to females who fawned and fluttered over him. The kind of women who stroked his ego with assurances that he was a magnificent lover and no doubt begged for the opportunity to remain in his bed.</p><p>That knowledge did nothing for her own mood and it was a relief when there was a flutter of wings and Levet floated down from a nearby tree branch.</p><p>\u201cAt last,\u201d the tiny gargoyle complained. \u201cI had begun to fear that you had forgotten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be so lucky,\u201d Santiago snarled, stepping past Levet to head toward the truck nearly hidden by the thick brush.</p><p>Levet sniffed, moving to walk at Nefri\u2019s side. \u201cWhat crawled up his ear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ass, gargoyle,\u201d Santiago corrected, tugging open the door of the vehicle, which looked as if it should be headed for the junkyard. ASAP. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018what crawled up my ass.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d Levet wrinkled his snout. \u201cI do not wish to know anything concerning your nether regions.\u201d</p><p>Santiago narrowed his eyes, his beautiful features tight with irritation. \u201cJust get in and shut up.\u201d</p><p>Nefri reached to pat the gargoyle on the head, her gaze never wavering from the cranky male. \u201cIgnore him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Levet gave a flick of his tail. \u201cHe\u2019s rather large to ignore.\u201d</p><p>A humorless smile curved Santiago\u2019s lips. \u201cNefri can give you lessons. She\u2019s made an art form of ignoring what she doesn\u2019t want to have to deal with.\u201d He waited until she reached the truck, his finger lifting to stroke down her cheek. \u201cHaven\u2019t you, cara?\u201d</p><p>She refused to flinch from his glare. Maybe she had been too swift to protect herself from the emotions Santiago threatened to expose. And clearly she could have been more sensitive to his male ego.</p> <p>But now was hardly the time to be bickering.</p><p>\u201cAre we going or not?\u201d she demanded in cool tones.</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d Levet cleared his throat. \u201cPerhaps I should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Santiago snapped, grabbing the gargoyle by one horn and tossing him into the truck.</p> <p>\u201cMon dieu,\u201d Levet squeaked as he landed on the leather seat.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Nefri rounded the back of the truck to slide into the passenger side, in a cowardly way pleased to have the gargoyle between her and Santiago.</p><p>Not that she believed he would ever try to harm her. Santiago was by nature a protector and no matter how she might infuriate him, he would never strike out. Besides, she had enough power to protect herself from any enemy.</p><p>No, she simply didn\u2019t want to spend the next few hours rehashing her impulsive decision to share Santiago\u2019s bed only to panic when she awoke in his arms.</p><p>It would mean exposing her scars from a past she simply wanted to forget.</p><p>With a low curse, Santiago climbed behind the steering wheel and used his powers to start the engine. Then, with a last glare at Nefri, he shoved the truck into gear and sent them jolting down the narrow road.</p> <p>Once they reached the highway, Santiago pressed the accelerator to the floorboard, urging the truck into breakneck speed.</p><p>Thankful for her immortality, Nefri watched the landscape flash by, catching only blurred glimpses of tangled wetlands that eventually gave way to small farms, with the occasional town huddled in the soft glow of streetlights.</p><p>They had traveled nearly an hour in uncomfortable silence when Nefri\u2019s brooding thoughts were interrupted by the strange sensations that suddenly filled the air.</p><p>\u201cSantiago.\u201d</p><p>Even as his name fell from her lips, Santiago was slowing the truck and turning onto a service road. \u201cI feel it,\u201d he muttered, his gaze trained on the trees that lined the recently plowed fields.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Levet stood on the seat, his expression troubled. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p><p>Nefri shivered, rolling down her window to test the chill breeze.</p><p>There was the same pulse of emotion that surrounded Gaius\u2019s lair. An unnatural coercion that could easily manipulate the feelings of both human and demon.</p> <p>But this wasn\u2019t violence that brushed over her skin and tugged at her emotions.</p><p>This was . . . fear.</p><p>A drenching, unrelenting fear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Santiago agreed, turning the truck onto an even smaller path, downshifting as they were forced to dodge fallen tree trunks and potholes large enough to swallow them whole. \u201cBut it\u2019s close enough we have to track it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed, clenching her teeth as he cut through an overgrown meadow to halt near an abandoned schoolhouse.</p><p>They crawled out of the truck, all three of them studying the three-story brick building with a rusting tin roof. The cement steps were crumbling and most of the windows had been smashed, while the double front doors hung at drunken angles.</p><p>The surrounding playground had long ago conceded defeat to the encroaching weeds, although someone had cut a path around the swing set and metal slide. No doubt the same someone who\u2019d built the smoldering bonfire and brought the keg of beer.</p><p>Allowing her powers to flow through the thick air, Nefri swiftly sensed the human hiding in the building. She lifted one finger and Santiago nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll circle around and come in from the rear,\u201d he said, pulling loose the sword he kept strapped to his back.</p><p>She instinctively reached to touch his arm, an uninvited concern clenching her heart. \u201cWhoever is inside is close to breaking,\u201d she murmured, able to feel the human\u2019s rising hysteria. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>With a cocky smile Santiago melted into the darkness, moving with the fluid speed of a trained warrior. Nefri shook her head in annoyance. Why was she worried about him? Not only was he more than capable of taking care of himself, but she\u2019d already decided that she was going to consider him as nothing more than a necessary tool to achieve her goals.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>Refusing to admit that she was finding the task of cutting her connection to the aggravating male more difficult than it should be, Nefri turned to glance down at the gargoyle at her side. \u201cLevet, could you keep watch?\u201d she asked. \u201cThis might be a trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d Levet studied the surrounding trees before glancing back to the schoolhouse. \u201cI\u2019ll be on the roof. It should give me the best vantage point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContact me if anything approaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>Confident that nothing could sneak past the gargoyle, Nefri crossed the playground to climb the stairs and enter the building.</p><p>She paused in the small vestibule. Ahead of her a set of stairs led to the upper floors, the stones worn in the middle by the thousands of small feet that had climbed them over the years. To the side of the stairs, a narrow hall led to the inner classrooms, which reeked of rotting wood and mold.</p><p>And fear.</p><p>Bone-deep, soul-crushing fear.</p><p>With a shiver, she moved down the hallway, following the overwhelming sensations.</p><p>\u201cSantiago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found her,\u201d he said, his voice low and soothing.</p><p>Nefri stepped into the dark room, her gaze skimming the overturned desks and decaying books that were scattered upon the warped planks of the floor.</p><p>Weaving her way through the debris, she found Santiago seated beneath a cracked chalkboard, a young human female shivering in his lap.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Nefri studied the girl, who appeared no more than sixteen in human years. She was nearly naked with only a tiny thong to cover her thin body. Her long blond hair was tangled and her face coated with dust and tears. But, it was the unmistakable wounds on her neck that caught Nefri\u2019s attention. The girl had been bitten by a vampire. \u201cThe poor creature,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Santiago glanced up as she approached. \u201cCan you watch her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to make sure there are no hidden surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should do that,\u201d she countered. \u201cYou remain with the girl.\u201d</p><p>His brows snapped together. \u201cNefri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take any risks, I promise.\u201d She interrupted the inevitable argument, knowing this wasn\u2019t about who had the most power, but his primitive need to protect her. \u201cOnly I can break through illusions. Besides, the human has attached herself to you. She\u2019s likely to panic if you leave her now.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened, but he gave a reluctant nod. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019ll try to question the female.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze to the girl, who was clinging to Santiago like a barnacle, her soft whimpers muffled against his chest.</p><p>\u201cCan you reach her? She appears . . . broken.\u201d</p><p>He ran a gentle hand over the girl\u2019s hair. \u201cYou have your talents and I have mine.\u201d</p><p>Nefri didn\u2019t doubt him for a minute.</p><p>For all of Santiago\u2019s swagger, there was something unquestionably comforting about his presence. A safe harbor a woman could depend on . . .</p><p>She took an abrupt step backward as the dangerous words whispered through her heart. \u201cI won\u2019t be long,\u201d she muttered, turning to hurry from the room.</p><p>Speaking the words of power that would break any lingering illusions, Nefri moved through the remaining classrooms before heading upstairs. She concentrated on the gaping holes in the floors as well as the steel lockers that threatened to topple above the unwary. Anything to avoid examining her unruly emotions.</p><p>Santiago was right about one thing.</p><p>She\u2019d become a master at sticking her head in the sand.</p><p>The ultimate ostrich.</p><p>It took only a few minutes to make her way through the upper rooms, but slipping out a broken window, she stood on the fire escape and motioned toward the gargoyle, who was on the highest peak of the sharply angled roof. \u201cAnything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNon.\u201d Levet\u2019s wings fluttered, shimmering in colors of blue and crimson and gold in the chilled moonlight. \u201cNothing is stirring, not even a mouse.\u201d</p><p>She paused at his odd words before giving a slow nod. He wasn\u2019t exaggerating. The surrounding countryside should be alive with nocturnal animals foraging for food and the predators that hunted them.</p><p>Instead an echoing silence spoke of a complete lack of wildlife.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t even the buzz of an insect.</p><p>The spreading fear had affected even the most basic of animal forms.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a girl inside we must question,\u201d she at last said. \u201cCan you remain on guard?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Despite the gargoyle\u2019s unease, he gave a ready nod, his courage astonishing for such a small creature. \u201cOui. You can depend upon me.\u201d</p><p>Without conscious thought she reached to brush a light hand over the tip of his wing. It was only when she was climbing back through the window that she realized how natural it felt to make physical contact.</p><p>Something she hadn\u2019t allowed herself for centuries.</p> <p>Obviously being in this world was altering more than just her powers.</p><p>Affection, desire, concern . . .</p><p>What was next?</p><p>Love?</p><p>With a shake of her head, Nefri made her way back to the lower floor. How often did she have to warn herself that now was not the time to be distracted by such foolishness?</p> <p>In fact, never seemed like a good time.</p><p>Smoothing her expression into a calm mask, she entered the classroom and crossed to where Santiago remained seated on the floor with the human cradled in his lap. \u201cThe building is clear,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cThis is Melinda.\u201d He lifted his head to send her a speaking glance as the girl trembled in his arms. Nefri halted, belatedly realizing her presence was adding to the girl\u2019s distress. \u201cSssh, mija,\u201d Santiago murmured, running a comforting hand over her tangled hair. \u201cNo one is going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Nefri slowly bent down to sit on the floor. Towering over the child wasn\u2019t going to help. \u201cDoes she know what happened to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just getting to that, weren\u2019t we, Melinda?\u201d His attention returned to the female, who gave a violent shake of her head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know it was horrible for you,\u201d he sympathized in soothing tones.</p><p>\u201cIt was worse than horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s return to the beginning,\u201d Santiago urged. \u201cCan you do that for me?\u201d</p><p>Melinda shuddered, but clearly as susceptible as every other female to Santiago\u2019s potent charm, she sucked in a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl. How long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkled in genuine confusion. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. A day, maybe two. Does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d He tilted back her chin, studying her pale, tearstained face. \u201cWhy were you at this place?\u201d</p><p>Nefri watched the girl struggle to swallow, the sound of her pounding heart thundering through the room.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a party. A birthday party for Brian,\u201d she at last managed to rasp. \u201cWe always come here because the police never drive out this far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe started with a couple dozen or so, but once the keg ran dry a lot of people began returning to town.\u201d Her bottom lip stuck out, reminding Nefri of just how young she truly was. Barely more than a baby. \u201cThere was some stupid dance at the high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you stayed?\u201d Santiago asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She gave a slow nod. \u201cI\u2019ve waited forever for Robert to notice me and he . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Santiago urged.</p><p>The girl burrowed her face in Santiago\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me,\u201d Santiago said, threading his words with a trace of compulsion.</p><p>Nefri lifted her brows at his delicate touch. It was rare for a vampire to be able to influence a human without seizing complete control of their minds and destroying their free will. At the same time he was able to soothe her hysterics despite the fear that continued to pulse in the air.</p><p>Amazing.</p><p>With a tentative motion, Melinda pulled her head back to meet Santiago\u2019s dark gaze. \u201cThere were six of us left and we started kissing and stuff,\u201d she admitted in a husky voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he prodded.</p><p>\u201cSantiago,\u201d Nefri softly protested.</p><p>He lifted a silencing hand, his gaze never straying from the humiliated girl. \u201cMelinda, tell me.\u201d</p><p>She hunched a defensive shoulder. \u201cI think someone must have spiked our drinks because one minute I was making out with Robert and the next we were all on the ground . . .\u201d Her head dropped, a blush staining her pale cheeks. \u201cYou know . . . together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s something you don\u2019t usually enjoy?\u201d Santiago asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d She tilted back her head. \u201cI\u2019m not a slut no matter what Vicky Spearman might say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you just couldn\u2019t stop yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We were all out of control.\u201d</p><p>Santiago shot Nefri a glance and she gave a slow nod. The girl was incapable of lying under Santiago\u2019s compulsion, which meant that she was truly horrified by her participation in group sex.</p><p>Lust...</p><p>As powerful an emotion as violence and fear.</p><p>Santiago shifted his gaze back to Melinda. \u201cThen what happened?\u201d</p><p>She trembled. \u201cThe air was suddenly freezing and when I opened my eyes I realized there was a stranger standing over us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDescribe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot super tall, thin with dark hair.\u201d She licked her lips, her heartbeat quickening. \u201cWeird eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was like he was looking at us, but he wasn\u2019t really seeing us,\u201d the girl explained. \u201cI thought at first he must be some crazy crackhead who wanted to be closer to the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Nefri leaned forward. Gaius was alone? Surely the girl had to be mistaken. \u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>Melinda never allowed her gaze to stray from Santiago. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone else, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d Santiago assured her. \u201cWhat did the stranger do?\u201d</p><p>She paused, as if struggling to remember. \u201cAt first he just stood there, but then Brian jumped up and tried to take a swing at him.\u201d She made a sound of distress. \u201cThe man laughed and grabbed Brian by the throat and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. You\u2019re safe, mija.\u201d Santiago\u2019s voice eased the rising panic, as soft and beguiling as dark velvet. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe bit him.\u201d Melinda lifted a hand to her own neck, touching the wounds that still leaked a trickle of blood. \u201cLike he was an animal or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to run, but I was so freaked out I couldn\u2019t move. None of us could.\u201d</p><p>Had Gaius been able to shift the humans\u2019 emotions from lust to fear? Or had the mysterious spirit been hidden nearby?</p><p>\u201cDid the stranger hurt your friends?\u201d Santiago continued.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Melinda bit her lower lip, tears filling her eyes. \u201cI think . . . I think they\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I remember is being lifted off my feet and a pain.\u201d She pulled her fingers away from the wound, frowning as she noticed the blood staining her skin. \u201cI woke up alone here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Santiago brushed the tears from the girl\u2019s cheeks, accepting that she\u2019d revealed everything she knew of her encounter with Gaius.</p><p>\u201cMelinda, I need to speak with my\u201d\u2014he glanced up to meet Nefri\u2019s steady gaze\u2014\u201ccompanion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The girl dug her fingers into his chest, her eyes wide with terror. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be just outside the door,\u201d he promised, genuine sympathy stabbing his heart.</p><p>The girl might physically recover, but mentally . . .</p><p>Just one more reason to track down Gaius and gut him like a pig.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come back and get me if I\u2019m left alone,\u201d Melinda sobbed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s long gone, mija.\u201d He ran his hand down her cheek, using his powers to try and comfort her. \u201cI promise you.\u201d</p><p>Beyond even his talents, Melinda quivered in fear. \u201cTake me with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelinda. Melinda, look at me.\u201d Cupping her chin, he forced her to meet his gaze. \u201cI want you to relax.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, struggling against the compulsion in his voice.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . . I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired.\u201d</p><p>Her face went slack. \u201cTired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes, Melinda.\u201d His voice hardened to a direct command. \u201cYou\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her lashes lowered.</p><p>\u201cNow sleep, mija,\u201d he whispered next to her ear. \u201cSleep.\u201d</p><p>Waiting until her body was limp and her breathing was steady, Santiago laid her on the floor. Then, grabbing the sword he\u2019d set aside when he\u2019d found the girl hiding in the corner, he rose to his feet.</p><p>With a nod of his head toward the door, he led Nefri out of the classroom into the narrow hall.</p><p>\u201cTalented, indeed,\u201d Nefri murmured. \u201cHow long will she be out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough,\u201d he said, annoyed by his flare of pleasure at her words of admiration. Dammit, he was still sulking. \u201cI\u2019ll call Styx to have the local clan chief take her to a safe house until one of the Ravens can collect her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She arched a dark brow. \u201cThe Oracles might want to have the first right to question her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let Styx and the Commission hash out jurisdiction.\u201d He slid the sword into the scabbard angled across his back. \u201cI have no interest in politics.\u201d</p><p>Some elusive emotion flickered through her eyes.</p> <p>Relief?</p><p>But why?</p><p>Because he had no political ambition?</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask Levet to keep watch on her until the clan chief arrives,\u201d she offered before glancing around the rapidly decaying building. \u201cNot that anyone would willingly come here.

Fear.\u201d He grimaced at the thick emotion that poured off poor Melinda and filled the air. \u201cIt\u2019s as potent as the violence was in the swamps. And no doubt as potent as the lust that swayed Melinda and her friends into their first orgy. Do you see a pattern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmotions,\u201d she readily admitted.</p><p>Of course she would have connected the dots, he wryly acknowledged.</p><p>Her intelligence was as lethal as her powers.</p><p>\u201cStrong, primitive emotions.\u201d He narrowed his gaze. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMierda.\u201d He rammed his hand into the pocket of his jeans, pulling out his cell phone. \u201cWhy do I bother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSantiago.\u201d Her fingers landed lightly on his arm. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it now?\u201d he growled, not giving a damn how rude he sounded. She\u2019d slammed the door in his face for the last time. She wanted all business between them? Fine. They would be all business.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I do know,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He froze, frowning at her with open suspicion. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, clearly having expected him to jump for joy at her grudging offer. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you suddenly willing to share?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then, stepping back, she wrapped her arms around her waist in an oddly protective gesture.</p> <p>As if she was feeling . . . vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cBecause you were right.\u201d</p><p>He was right?</p><p>Was the sky falling?</p><p>\u201cI need you to say that again,\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d she repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to ask you to assist me in hunting Gaius without fully understanding the danger.\u201d</p><p>Hmmm. He wasn\u2019t sure he trusted her abrupt change of heart, but he\u2019d never been a vampire to look a gift epiphany in the mouth. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard rumors about the creation of the Veil?\u201d</p><p>Santiago snorted at the ridiculous question. Like every vampire, he\u2019d heard the fairy tales surrounding the Veil.</p><p>\u201cThe one where it\u2019s a rift in time and space that sucked you and your people through?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr the one where you ascended godlike to a higher plane of existence?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cThe Commission circulated a dozen different stories after they created the Veil.\u201d</p><p>So the Oracles had been responsible for the wild tales. Interesting. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no one would guess their true purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo trap a creature on the other side.\u201d</p><p>Santiago took a minute to consider her startling confession. Of all the stories that had circulated over the centuries, he\u2019d never heard even a whisper that the Veil was some sort of cosmic prison.</p><p>\u201cWhat creature?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. Did she think he was stupid?</p><p>\u201cHow can you not know?\u201d</p><p>She paused\u2014not like she was going to refuse to answer, but as if she was carefully considering her words. \u201cFrom what I was told, it\u2019s more a spirit than an actual creature.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. Spirit was a broad term. It could mean anything from a genuine ghost to a hundred different species that had no corporeal form in this dimension.</p><p>\u201cSo what made this spirit so dangerous that they would cage it behind a magical curtain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t share that information with me.\u201d</p><p>He studied her pale, perfect face. He couldn\u2019t sense a lie, but that didn\u2019t mean anything. This female was a master at disguising her true emotions.</p><p>\u201cYou agreed to live in the same prison as a spirit that was so dangerous the Oracles had to create a rip in space to protect the world from it and you didn\u2019t even ask what it could do to you?\u201d he drawled in disbelief.</p><p>She shrugged, her gaze steady and her expression unreadable. \u201cThe spirit had been in hibernation for centuries and most assumed that it would never awaken,\u201d she said. \u201cI was merely there to be an early warning if it began to stir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow were you supposed to know it was\u201d\u2014he deliberately paused\u2014\u201cstirring?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThe Oracles claimed that the peace my people sought would be disturbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>So, the Oracles create a rift to protect the world from some mysterious evil. Then, instead of letting sleeping evil spirits rest in solitude, they eventually sent Nefri and her clan to the other side.</p><p>There was something missing. Hell, there was a whole lot missing.</p><p>\u201cWhy you?\u201d he abruptly demanded.</p><p>Nefri clenched her hands. Was this vampire never satisfied?</p><p>She\u2019d revealed far more than she should have. Certainly enough to get her in trouble with the Commission.</p><p>Never a good thing.</p><p>But was he satisfied?</p><p>No.</p><p>He had to poke and prod and\u2014</p><p>\u201cNefri,\u201d he repeated, his expression predictably stubborn.</p><p>She absently toyed with a lock of hair that had fallen on her cheek and sternly reminded herself that Santiago was risking his life to assist her in finding Gaius.</p><p>He deserved the truth.</p><p>The whole truth.</p><p>\u201cThe Commission was aware that I sought asylum for myself and my clan.\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward, gently brushing her fingers aside so he could tuck the lock of hair behind her ear. \u201cAsylum from what?\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lowered to hide her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a long and boring story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be long, but I seriously doubt that it\u2019s boring,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>A tiny shiver of pleasure raced through her body. \u201cAs you\u2019ve so kindly pointed out, I\u2019m ancient even by vampire standards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make me believe you\u2019re sensitive about your age, cara,\u201d he protested, his fingers tracing the line of her cheek before moving to outline her lips. \u201cNot when the years have given you the regal beauty of a queen and the powers of a goddess.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from his touch. How could she concentrate when his lightest caress was sending distracting jolts of arousal through her body?</p><p>\u201cVery pretty, but not entirely accurate.\u201d</p><p>A knowing smile curved his lips at her revealing retreat.</p><p>Aggravating vampire.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy powers haven\u2019t come with age,\u201d she corrected him. \u201cThey were a part of me from the night I was made into a vampire.\u201d</p><p>His smile disappeared as his eyes darkened with astonishment.</p><p>Not surprising.</p><p>Most vampires gained their powers in a slow evolution over their foundling years. Some gained more than others, but it was a fairly predictable progression.</p><p>She, on the other hand, had been blessed with a profound excess of power from the night she\u2019d been \u201cturned.\u201d</p><p>At least she was told she\u2019d been blessed.</p><p>It had felt more like a curse.</p><p>\u201cDios,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThat must have been a shock to your sire. Always assuming he stayed around.\u201d</p><p>It had happened so long ago Nefri barely recalled awakening alone and naked on the banks of the Euphrates River. She had a vague memory of roaming alone and disoriented, unable to recall her former life, before a man had appeared in the cave where she was hiding and carried her away.</p><p>At the time she\u2019d been relieved to have someone explain what and who she was. But that relief hadn\u2019t lasted long.</p><p>\u201cHe returned for me once he realized I could be of use.\u201d</p><p>Santiago\u2019s features hardened. \u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m fairly certain you can,\u201d she said softly, struck by a sudden revelation that he was one of the few who truly could understand.</p><p>Was that why she felt so drawn to him? Because they shared similar scars from their past?</p><p>Well, that and the fact that he was insanely gorgeous, sexy, powerful, and fiercely loyal.</p><p>\u201cNefri?\u201d he prompted, frowning in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t placed in the pits,\u201d she said, turning to glance down the shadowed hallway. More to hide her expression than to make sure they were alone. Although the fear swirling through the air was muted as Melinda remained in a deep sleep, it was still potent enough to prevent any unwelcome trespassers. \u201cBut I was trained to become a weapon for my clan chief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou defended the clan?\u201d he easily guessed.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWhen we were being attacked, but more often I was used in our battles to conquer other clans.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Santiago muttered in sympathy as he cupped her face in his hands, gently urging her head back to meet his searching gaze. In that moment, Nefri\u2019s earlier speculations of why she found this man so fascinating were instantly dismissed.</p><p>Yes, he was gorgeous and sexy and loyal. And yes, they both had suffered.</p><p>But it was his swift empathy that truly touched her heart.</p> <p>What other vampire would so easily understand that far from taking pride in her battle prowess, she was horrified by what she\u2019d done?</p><p>\u201cYou were forced to kill?\u201d</p><p>Disjointed memories of bloody battles and mangled corpses flared through her mind, making her wince. \u201cMore times than I can count.\u201d</p><p>His fingers skimmed down her throat, his touch offering a blessed comfort. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re so desperate for peace.\u201d</p><p>She knew she should push away his hand. His ability to offer her a sense of safety was as dangerously alluring as his potent sensuality.</p> <p>Instead, she leaned into his lingering touch.</p><p>Foolish.</p><p>So very foolish.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t even the worst,\u201d she said, the ancient pain a dull throb that never truly went away.</p><p>He scowled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please.\u201d She stiffened her spine. She knew herself all too well. If he allowed her to scurry behind her defensive walls, then she\u2019d never crawl back out. \u201cLet me finish.\u201d</p> <p>He gave a slow dip of his head. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fighting was something I learned to endure, simply because I had no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurvival can be a bitch,\u201d he said. He, of course, understood exactly what she meant.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His thumb rubbed the sensitive hollow just below her ear. \u201cWhat was your breaking point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen my chief started hiring me out as a weapon for other clans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe pimped you out?\u201d He made a sound of disgust, although it hadn\u2019t been unusual in the past for the chiefs to use their people for profit, whether it was as soldiers, whores, or just for sport.</p><p>\u201cI was always available to the highest bidder,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter what they wanted me to do.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head, his thumb stroking the line of her tightly clenched jaw. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, cara,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou were at the mercy of a man consumed by greed and ambition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter if it was my fault or not. The outcome was the same.\u201d</p><p>Accepting he wasn\u2019t going to be able to convince her that she was blameless, he studied her with a brooding gaze. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bided my time and when I felt prepared I entered the battles of Durotriges to become a clan chief.\u201d She didn\u2019t have to say that she\u2019d nearly died during her trials, or that she\u2019d been forever altered by staring death in the face over and over. Only a small percentage of vampires went into the battles and came out the other side. It was accepted that they would gain a greater appreciation for life. Their own and others. Which made them particularly suited to becoming a clan chief. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ever going to be a weapon for anyone again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd never out of control again, eh, querida?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Being stronger than every creature around her had taught her the danger of giving in to her emotions.</p><p>\u201cWhen I become angry or frightened the people around me end up dead.\u201d She shivered. \u201cSometimes a lot of people.\u201d</p><p>The dark gaze swept over her upturned face. \u201cAnd so you created a clan dedicated to peace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiled wryly. It had seemed so simple. She knew there had to be like-minded vampires who wanted to build an oasis of peace. The only rub was finding someplace where they could be safe from the demons who would take their desire for tranquility as a sign of weakness. They had to be protected. \u201cAnd I went to the Commission to discover if there was a place where we could be separated from the violence of this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when they sent you beyond the Veil?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hand, her fingers brushing over the golden medallion that remained warm to the touch no matter what the temperature. \u201cWith the assistance of this.\u201d</p><p>Without warning Santiago\u2019s low growl trickled through the hallway, his dark eyes flashing with fury.</p><p>\u201cDios, the bastards knowingly put you in danger.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThey didn\u2019t lie to me. I went beyond the Veil knowing the creature was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you were so anxious to keep your people safe,\u201d he snapped. \u201cAnd they used that desperation to lure you into taking care of their problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Commission rarely does anything out of the goodness of their hearts,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cBesides, the past no longer matters.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Santiago\u2019s power trembled with the need to explode. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure why he was so pissed off.</p><p>As Nefri said, the Commission wasn\u2019t a collection of do-gooders. They were ruthless leaders who would readily sacrifice an entire clan of vampires if they thought it necessary to protect the world.</p><p>But the thought that Nefri had been forced to choose between keeping her people safe and living on top of a potential time bomb . . . yeah, it pissed him off.</p><p>\u201cThe hell it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he muttered, lowering his head to capture her lips in a kiss of seething frustration. \u201cBut we can finish this discussion later.\u201d As he pulled back, he met her puzzled gaze. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were angry with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a habit of being an ass when I don\u2019t get my way,\u201d he readily admitted. He was hot tempered, but he was always willing to confess when he was in the wrong. He\u2019d known there was a reason why she struggled so hard to keep him at a distance, but his pride had been pricked by her cold dismissal. Now he offered a rueful grin. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I?\u201d</p><p>He swooped back down to steal another kiss. \u201cMmmm.\u201d</p><p>Her hands lifted to lie against his chest and for one tantalizing moment Nefri allowed her lips to part, conceding to the scorching heat that blazed between them.</p><p>Then all too soon her hands were pressing him away. \u201cSantiago.\u201d</p><p>He nipped at her chin in punishment. \u201cIs this important?\u201d</p><p>She shivered in pleasure. \u201cYou need to call Styx so we can continue our search for Gaius.\u201d</p><p>His tongue traced the full line of her lower lip. \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSantiago.\u201d She gave a tiny moan before shoving hard enough to break his clinging grip. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>He shut his eyes, shuddering at his swift arousal. Mierda. What was it about this female that made him behave like a damned Were in heat?</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re right,\u201d he conceded in thick tones, opening his eyes to meet her wary gaze. \u201cBut I still have a few questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did the spirit escape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSiljar claimed that when the Dark Lord was destroyed it left a void in Gaius\u2019s medallion that the spirit used to enter this world.\u201d</p><p>He took a minute to consider her words, at the same time sending out his power to make sure that Melinda remained in her deep sleep. The last thing they needed was the girl waking up in a panic.</p><p>\u201cAs good an explanation as any, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sent me to discover if it was the right explanation.\u201d Nefri shrugged. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. All? Dios. He had a thousand questions. Unfortunately they would have to wait. Instead, he forced himself to concentrate on the most pressing problems.</p><p>\u201cI would be a lot happier if I knew precisely what this creature is capable of,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cYou know as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is what?\u201d He gave a frustrated shake of his head. He\u2019d fought more enemies than he could count over the years, but while many had been immortal, they\u2019d at least been creatures he could make bleed. This . . . thing was something he didn\u2019t know how to fight. It made him twitchy. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious the spirit is capable of stirring emotions.\u201d</p><p>Nefri slowly shook her head. \u201cActually, it seems more likely that Gaius is the cause of the overwhelming emotions,\u201d she said. \u201cOr at least his bite is.\u201d</p><p>True.</p><p>Which only made the crazy situation . . . crazier.</p><p>\u201cSo this creature infects vampires?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hands in a gesture of genuine bafflement. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to say until we manage to find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d He pulled out his phone. \u201cYou warn the gargoyle he\u2019ll need to stay while I call Styx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you claim that I\u2019m bossy?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cDo you have a better suggestion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she denied, her expression one of cool challenge. \u201cI just wished to point out that people in glass houses shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>With a quick motion that caught her off guard, he wrapped an arm around her waist and yanked her against his body. \u201cShouldn\u2019t do this?\u201d He leaned down to press his lips to the tender curve of her neck. \u201cOr this?\u201d He nibbled down to the edge of her sweater, savoring the intoxicating scent of jasmine. \u201cOr maybe this?\u201d His tongue traced a throbbing vein back up her throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEnough,\u201d she protested, her voice unsteady as her cheeks flushed with arousal.</p><p>\u201cNot nearly,\u201d he muttered, but with a stab of regret, he released her.</p><p>The spirit had to be found before it could ignite the humans into mass genocide.</p> <p>But once it had been destroyed, along with Gaius, then . . .</p><p>Then he was going to lock this woman in his private rooms and throw away the key.</p><p>Styx\u2019s lair in Chicago</p><p>Sally was as miserable as a witch could be.</p><p>Roke had done his part. With the natural command of a clan chief he\u2019d managed to convince the guards that Styx wanted to see her in his study. Then, avoiding the plethora of demons, servants, and video cameras, he\u2019d halted only long enough to slip on a leather motorcycle jacket he\u2019d left just outside the dungeon doors, before leading her to a forgotten pantry near the kitchens.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until then that she had discovered that her magic refused to work.</p><p>She told herself it had to be some sort of dampening spell despite the lack of hex markings. If Styx had it in the dungeons, why wouldn\u2019t he have it in the rest of the house? It made perfect sense.</p><p>But, deep inside she feared the interference wasn\u2019t going to go away even when they were beyond the lair.</p><p>She\u2019d never tried to use witch magic when she was using her natural talents.</p><p>Crap, crap, crap.</p><p>Absently rubbing the sleeve of her sweatshirt where it covered her inner forearm, she once again struggled to conjure a spell of illusion. It should be easy. It was a spell she\u2019d performed a thousand times.</p> <p>But there was nothing. Nada. Jack-squat.</p><p>Her magic was MIA.</p><p>And it was driving her crazy.</p><p>Almost as crazy as her arm. Why the hell was it itchy?</p><p>\u201cHow much longer is this going to take?\u201d</p><p>With a tiny jolt, she realized that Roke had shifted to stand directly before her, his expression one of tender concern.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she muttered, ignoring her stupid stab of guilt. This vampire had held her prisoner, she reminded herself for the hundredth time. Why shouldn\u2019t she do everything in her power to escape? Her sudden inability to conjure a simple spell of illusion had nothing to do with karma. \u201cMy magic . . .\u201d</p><p>His eyes shimmered with a startlingly pale light in the darkness. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still muted.\u201d She dropped her head, afraid the lie might be written on her face. \u201cThere must be something dampening my powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Styx is nothing if not thorough.\u201d He thankfully accepted her explanation, brushing a hand down her back in unspoken sympathy. \u201cBut, we can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, afraid of leaving the pantry without her magic protecting them. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to get out of here before the guards realize that you aren\u2019t meeting with the Anasso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got that, but\u2014\u201d Her words broke off as her companion turned toward the shelves of canned food, holding out his hands as he walked from one end of the pantry to another. \u201cRoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSssh,\u201d he replied, distracted.</p><p>She watched in baffled silence as he continued his pacing, his head tilted to the side so his raven hair brushed his shoulder. He looked like he was searching for something. But what?</p><p>French sliced green beans?</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re starting to weird me out,\u201d she said, at last breaking the thick silence.</p><p>He chuckled, halting to shove aside the cans. \u201cHave faith, my love.\u201d</p><p>My love. She grimaced. Man, but he was going to be sooooo pissed when her spell wore off.</p><p>And it would wear off. Even now she could feel her strength fading. In a half hour, maybe less, she would be completely drained and then . . .</p><p>She was thankfully distracted as Roke gave a sudden shove on the shelf and a section of the back wall parted with a low groan.</p><p>\u201cA hidden door,\u201d she breathed in shock. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a talent for sensing structural anomalies.\u201d He offered a wicked smile. \u201cAre you impressed?\u201d</p><p>She briefly forgot how to breathe. God almighty, he was beautiful. Unreasonably, indecently beautiful, with an ability to make her knees go weak at the most inconvenient times.</p><p>\u201cWe should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d he warned, pulling the narrow door wide before stepping into the darkness. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to see once the door closes.\u201d</p><p>Hesitantly she followed him into the dusty shadows, grimacing at the choking darkness. Although she could see better than humans, she couldn\u2019t match a vampire\u2019s night vision.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no lights?\u201d she complained, wiping away a cobweb that stuck to her hair.</p><p>\u201cNo, I would guess that these tunnels were intended for an emergency escape.\u201d</p><p>He moved with fluid speed, indifferent to the steep decline of the passageway and the unevenness of the dirt floor.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d She stumbled over an unseen rock.</p><p>\u201cHold on to me.\u201d He reached a hand back to capture her fingers in a tight grip. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Sally forgot the unnerving darkness and the suspicion that the neglected passageway was filled with creepy crawlies as their hands connected with a shock of raw excitement.</p><p>She bit back a small gasp. Blessed goddess. How could such a casual touch make her entire body clench with pleasure?</p><p>Roke was the one who was supposed to be under the sway of a binding spell, not her.</p><p>Unfortunately, her body didn\u2019t care.</p><p>It was ready and eager to respond.</p><p>Trying her best to concentrate on anything but the awareness tingling in the pit of her stomach, Sally counted each downward step. They were at least six feet below ground, she judged when the path at last evened out and curved in a northern direction.</p><p>They continued on for nearly an hour before Roke at last slowed his steps and came to a halt.</p><p>Sally breathed a sigh of relief. Despite her grinding urgency to get away from Styx\u2019s lair, she was increasingly drained by the energy necessary to keep Roke bound by her spell.</p><p>Any minute he was going to slip her leash and then . . .</p><p>She shivered. It didn\u2019t bear thinking about.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked, discreetly removing her hand from his grasp to lean against the dirt wall of the tunnel.</p><p>\u201cThis is the end of the tunnel,\u201d Roke said, tilting back his head to study the narrow opening directly over him. \u201cThere\u2019s an empty building above us.\u201d</p><p>She pressed a hand to the stitch in her side. \u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s empty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank god,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHow far are we from the house?\u201d</p><p>He paused, glancing back down the tunnel. \u201cA few miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it will have to do.\u201d</p><p>Gritting her teeth, she forced herself to straighten from the wall. She\u2019d barely taken a step forward, however, when Roke was standing directly in front of her, his hands rubbing up and down her arms.</p><p>\u201cLet me go first; I want to make sure it\u2019s safe,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat as she met the pale silver gaze. There were the yummy flutters in the pit of her stomach at his touch, but more than that, there was a sense of . . . rightness.</p><p>As if she knew his touch from another time, another place.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, the curt rejection as much for her ridiculous thoughts as his offer.</p><p>Jeez. Talk about Stockholm syndrome. Next she would be fantasizing she was his mate.</p><p>Almost as if sensing her stupid thoughts, he leaned down to brush his lips over her furrowed brow. \u201cI won\u2019t be long, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoke.\u201d She grasped the lapels of his leather coat. \u201cPlease listen to me.\u201d</p><p>His lips skimmed down the length of her nose before nibbling at the edge of her mouth. \u201cLater, my love.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tightened on his jacket, wanting to jerk him even closer so he could kiss her properly. Heck, they were alone in the dark and for the moment they seemed safe enough. Why not enjoy a quick . . .</p><p>Wait.</p><p>What was she thinking?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she rasped. \u201cI have to talk to you now.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head, but he remained close enough so that she could see the flash of his fully extended fangs even in the thick shadows. It should have reminded her that he was a lethal predator.

She had to get rid of him so she could release her fading binding spell and hopefully have enough juice left to activate her hidden amulet. That should disguise her presence long enough to escape the area. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But how?</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t outrun Styx\u2019s guards, not while my magic is on the fritz,\u201d she finally managed to blurt out.</p><p>\u201cOnce we\u2019re out of the tunnels your magic will return.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe or maybe not.\u201d She shuddered as his hand continued to soothe her tense muscles. \u201cI need you to distract them long enough for me to escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout me?\u201d His brows drew together. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce I\u2019m far enough away I\u2019ll contact you and you can join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoke,\u201d she protested his stubborn refusal to obey.</p> <p>Obviously her spell was rapidly losing its grip on him. And worse, she was growing weaker with every passing second.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because I\u2019ll be with you.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly it was all too much. \u201cDamn,\u201d she groaned, sliding down until her butt hit the dirt floor. \u201cI\u2019m too tired to fight.\u201d</p><p>Roke squatted in front of her, his expression concerned. \u201cRest here. I\u2019ll make sure the path is clear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRoke . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes, little witch,\u201d he murmured, brushing a finger over her chilled cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>If only that were true, she thought with a twinge of wistful longing.</p><p>If only this man did want to keep her safe.</p><p>Not because of some spell, but because he thought she was worth saving.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so stupid, Sally,\u201d she whispered as he pressed his hands against the floor and with one impressive shove was launching himself up and through the opening above. \u201cStupid and downright pathetic. You\u2019re going to end up dead in this tunnel and no one is going to give a damn.\u201d</p><p>It took Roke less than five minutes to scout through the empty house. It was obviously one of Styx\u2019s numerous safe houses that were used only in emergencies.</p><p>As he had told Sally, the Anasso was nothing if not thorough.</p> <p>Sally.</p><p>Roke came to a halt in the middle of the never-used kitchen. What the hell? With a sharp shake of his head he felt the urgent, driving need to rescue the beautiful witch from his brothers slowly fade.</p><p>Like a fog was being lifted from his mind.</p><p>He clenched his hands at his side, his fangs lengthening.</p><p>He vividly remembered going to the dungeons with a dinner tray. He\u2019d entered the cell and tried to convince Sally to confess the truth of Gaius\u2019s strange new talents.</p><p>And then . . .</p><p>And then he\u2019d been overwhelmed by a potent desire to do whatever was necessary to protect the woman who was his sole reason for living.</p><p>Goddammit.</p><p>The bitch had hit him with a spell.</p><p>There could be no other explanation.</p><p>Why else would he have suddenly been filled with an unshakable conviction she was his? Not just a pretty female he desired. But his. On a most primitive level.</p><p>Hell, even now he could . . . feel her. As if their very souls were entwined.</p><p>And worse, she had forced him to sacrifice everything, even loyalty to his people, to keep her safe.</p><p>Of all things, that was the one act he could never, ever forgive or forget.</p><p>He\u2019d taken a vow when he became clan chief that he would always put his people first. How could he offer them anything less? The previous chief had nearly destroyed them all by his obsession with a female who\u2019d demanded he pamper her every whim.</p><p>Now he\u2019d been forced to follow in the footsteps of the man he\u2019d hated.</p><p>She was going to pay for that.</p><p>With a roar that shattered the nearby window, he returned to the back bedroom where the trapdoor was hidden in the closet. Dropping into the lower tunnel, he landed lightly on the balls of his feet and stormed toward the female who was deeply asleep, curled on her side on the floor.</p><p>He was so angry the walls trembled from the force of his temper and the air was frigid enough to form ice crystals. But, as he squatted down to grab Sally and shake her awake, he hesitated.</p><p>Christ, she looked so tiny. And exhausted. The fragile features were more pale than usual, with bruised shadows beneath the thick crescents of her lowered lashes. Her autumn hair was splayed over the dirt, and her lips slightly parted, as if inviting a prince to kiss her awake.</p><p>Unfortunately for her, he was no prince, Roke bleakly reminded himself. And he\u2019d returned to discover just what nasty spell she\u2019d cast on him, not because of worry that she had pushed herself too hard.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>Her magic had to be screwing with his head.</p><p>Not to mention his renegade body, he conceded, abruptly shifting his fingers to her shoulder rather than brushing over her cheek as they started to do.</p><p>\u201cSally.\u201d He gave her a small shake. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed as she struggled to lift her lashes, the rich brown eyes dazed as she tried to focus on him.</p><p>\u201cRoke?\u201d She blinked in confusion. \u201cI can\u2019t . . . tired . . .\u201d</p><p>He leaned down so he could grasp her shoulders, pulling her into a sitting position with far greater care than she deserved. \u201cWake up,\u201d he commanded, not for the first time irritated that it was impossible to enthrall a witch. It would have saved them all one hell of a lot of trouble.</p><p>She groaned, her head tilting back to smack against the wall of the tunnel. \u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded in thick tones. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re about to explain, little witch,\u201d he snarled. \u201cJust what the hell did you do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo?\u201d</p><p>His threatening growl echoed through the tunnel. \u201cDon\u2019t even try to deny you put a spell on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He could hear her heartbeat quicken, her muscles clenching beneath his fingers. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her ridiculous denial. \u201cIs it black magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her words remained slurred with exhaustion. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I would take your word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I?\u201d She licked her lips and Roke swallowed a choked curse. Was it deliberate? Did she know the small provocation sent a jolt of hunger through his body? \u201cThe dungeons are hexed to prevent magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou obviously found a way to get around Styx\u2019s protection.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cUnless you expect me to believe I took one look at you and tumbled head over heels in love?\u201d</p><p>She flinched at his cruel mockery, but the foolish female didn\u2019t back down. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a spell. It was . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause before she heaved a weary sigh. \u201cMy natural powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatural?\u201d he scoffed. \u201cHumans have no powers.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lowered, hiding her eyes. \u201cThen the logical answer is that I\u2019m not entirely human,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>His brows snapped together. It was the logical answer. The hexes would have prevented any spell cast by a witch. Even the most powerful witch.</p><p>But how could he have missed the fact that she was a mongrel?</p><p>Did the fact she was a witch conceal her demon blood?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes remained closed as she shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>His fingers dug into her shoulders. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>With a tiny sound of distress her head flopped forward and Roke sensed her consciousness slip away.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He glared down at the top of her head. Now what?</p><p>The sensible thing to do would be to return her to the dungeons and let Styx deal with her.</p><p>Once he revealed that he was susceptible to the female\u2019s powers (yeah, and wouldn\u2019t that be a fun and jolly confession?) the Anasso would be careful to assign a new guard to keep watch on her.</p><p>But even as the thought crossed through his mind, he was shoving it aside. Not just because he didn\u2019t want to share his spectacular failure with Styx. But because he could still feel the damned woman lodged deep inside him.</p><p>When she woke, she was going to remove whatever curse she\u2019d put on him.</p><p>Then...</p><p>Then he was returning to Nevada and Styx could shove the prophet\u2019s vague warning up his ass.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>The middle of nowhere, Louisiana</p><p>Nefri returned from her search of the countryside to join Santiago at his vehicle.</p><p>While the male vampire had been burying the bodies of Melinda\u2019s drinking companions to prevent any lingering infection, Nefri had left Levet keeping watch over the sleeping girl while she\u2019d scouted for any signs of Gaius.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t shake the sensation that she was missing something.</p><p>Something that might very well be the difference between success and failure.</p><p>But no matter how hard she tried to pinpoint her source of unease, it slipped away as swiftly as a mist fairy.</p><p>Stepping around the bed of the truck, the nagging sensation was abruptly forgotten at the sight of Santiago leaning against the driver\u2019s side door.</p><p>What was it about this vampire that sent a shock of excitement through her just by catching sight of him?</p><p>She was an ancient clan chief who\u2019d assumed she had seen and done everything possible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But this . . .</p><p>It made her feel as if she were a giddy foundling who had yet to gain command of her hungers.</p><p>The logical part of her understood the sensations he aroused were dangerous. Not only to her hard-earned control, but to the part of her that was still very much a woman.</p> <p>But a larger part of her accepted that there was no way to fight what was happening between her and this gorgeous, sexy vampire. There seemed no choice but to allow their relationship to develop to an inevitable conclusion.</p><p>Whatever that conclusion might be.</p><p>Almost on cue, Santiago turned to send her one of those smiles she felt to the tips of her toes.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>With an effort, Nefri returned her mind to Gaius and his odd behavior. It was certainly more pressing than her girlish reaction to a charming male.</p> <p>\u201cThe emotions were far more contained than those near Gaius\u2019s lair,\u201d she said, moving to stand near Santiago while her gaze returned to the schoolhouse.</p><p>\u201cI assume he just stopped by for a quick snack,\u201d Santiago said. \u201cNo doubt the longer he stays in one spot the further his infections spread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound convinced.\u201d</p><p>She shifted her gaze to meet his frown. \u201cI agree with your logic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t understand his need for any snack, quick or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>He considered her words. \u201cBecause he didn\u2019t feed while he was with your clan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, since his return to this world he\u2019s clearly indulged his most primitive hungers, but he\u2019s a very old vampire. He shouldn\u2019t have to feed so often.\u201d Nefri grimaced. The Harpies had claimed they\u2019d found corpses disposed of in the swamps, not to mention the crazed human male they were holding captive. \u201cEspecially not after he seemingly gorged before leaving his lair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless he\u2019s still recovering from injuries,\u201d Santiago suggested. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how badly he was hurt during the battle with the Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering if the spirit is somehow draining Gaius,\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>Santiago straightened from the truck, taking time to mull over her suggestion. \u201cYou mean feeding off him?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just a theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes as much sense as anything else.\u201d</p><p>Not the most comforting assurance considering nothing about Gaius or the spirit made sense.</p><p>\u201cCan you feel Gaius?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, concentrating on his connection to his sire. \u201cI know he\u2019s north of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we gaining on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d he said after a beat. He opened his eyes. \u201cIt feels like he\u2019s settled in one place.\u201d</p><p>Yet another anomaly. She shook her head in frustration \u201cOdd, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t expect to be followed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe always was arrogant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not stupid.\u201d</p><p>Santiago easily followed her train of thought. \u201cYou suspect Gaius is setting an ambush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rather convenient that your connection to him returned just in time to follow his trail,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>He scowled, clearly already having considered the possibility he was being played by the vampire he\u2019d once considered his father. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be a coincidence. Or . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr an elaborate trap,\u201d he finished for her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He turned to pull open the door of the truck. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to find out.\u201d</p><p>Nefri crawled into the cab, scooting across the leather seat. She wasn\u2019t nearly so eager to confront Gaius. Not until she had more information on the spirit that she feared was far more powerful than she\u2019d first suspected.</p><p>But how?</p><p>The Commission had revealed all they intended to. It would be a waste of time to try and question them. And it wasn\u2019t as if there was a textbook lying around that explained mysterious spirits.</p><p>At least . . .</p><p>Not in this world.</p><p>She turned to study Santiago\u2019s profile as he put the truck in gear and headed back toward the highway. \u201cCan we reach Gaius tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shot her a curious glance. \u201cEven if he stays where he is it would take too many hours to reach him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I would request we make a small detour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRequest?\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhere\u2019s my commanding Nefri?\u201d She sniffed. \u201cYou called me bossy, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re partners?\u201d</p><p>She gave a slow nod, wondering if he truly understood how difficult it was for her to concede to his demands.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t about accepting someone could be her equal. She wasn\u2019t that vain.</p><p>It was allowing herself to be vulnerable.</p><p>Something easier said than done.</p><p>\u201cPartners,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d His grin widened. \u201cEven if it was like pulling teeth.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re very . . . persistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a stubborn, impulsive bastard who too often allows his heart to rule his head,\u201d he admitted, his smile fading as he held her gaze. \u201cBut, I would die for those I consider mine.\u201d</p><p>Warmth flared through her heart. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He turned his attention back to the field they were cutting through, slowing as they neared the narrow road. \u201cWhich direction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorth,\u201d she said, hoping she wasn\u2019t taking them on a wild goose chase. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He shot her a suspicious glance. \u201cYou aren\u2019t taking me to the Oracles, are you?\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cNot unless you wanted to drop in for a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather poke out my eye.\u201d</p><p>A feeling shared by most of the demon world, she wryly acknowledged. Including herself on occasion.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to the Oracles,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI have an acquaintance who might be of assistance.\u201d</p><p>His suspicion remained. Smart vampire.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of acquaintance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should wait and let you see for yourself,\u201d she murmured, struck by a sudden thought. \u201cOh, we need to find a ring or a necklace. Preferably made of diamonds. The larger the better.\u201d</p><p>His suspicion transformed to confusion. \u201cNot that I mind buying you all the bling your heart might desire, querida, but I\u2019m not sure there are any stores open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas that ever stopped you?\u201d she asked dryly.</p><p>His soft chuckle brushed over her skin with sinful pleasure. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Northern Arkansas</p><p>Santiago had used up most of the swear words he\u2019d learned during his considerably long life as he crawled through yet another mud-filled sinkhole that at last led to a hidden meadow.</p><p>An acquaintance, Nefri had claimed. Why hadn\u2019t he demanded more details? Like whether or not the creature lived in the Ozark Mountains in an area so remote not even a damned billy goat could find it?</p><p>Of course, he should have known something was up when she\u2019d demanded to be taken to the clan chief of Arkansas rather than a jewelry store to acquire a diamond the size of an ostrich egg. At the time, however, he was distracted by the clan chief \u2019s eagerness to impress Nefri with his generosity. Hell, Santiago didn\u2019t doubt the bedazzled vampire would have given his entire fortune if Nefri had requested it.</p><p>Now he wondered what kind of acquaintance demanded a priceless jewel and lived in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>Indifferent to his strange litany, Nefri led him out of the sinkhole and straight across the meadow, the clinging mud flaking off her jeans and sweater to leave her looking as fresh as a fucking daisy.</p><p>Even her long hair was perfect, shimmering like a river of ebony beneath the fading stars.</p><p>It was no wonder that the Arkansas clan chief had turned over a million-dollar diamond without batting a lash.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re lost you can just admit it,\u201d he muttered as she at last came to a halt in front of a dead tree that somehow managed to stay upright in the center of the meadow. \u201cI swear I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze remained locked on the tree. \u201cI\u2019m not lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re punishing me?\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched. \u201cIf and when I decide to punish you, Santiago, you will know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComforting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>He glanced around the empty meadow. Did she expect someone to be taking a late night stroll in this isolated area? \u201cYou made me ruin my boots to meet a tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d she murmured, leaning down to place the diamond in a small hollow beneath a gnarly root.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>She turned to offer a mysterious smile. The ice-princess at her most seductive.</p><p>\u201cNow we wait.\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward, trailing his fingers through the cool silk of her hair. This was a woman made for night. As distantly remote and beautiful as the moon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unless she was wrapped in his arms.</p><p>Then she was a shimmering, passionate creature who burned as hot as the sun.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very good at waiting,\u201d he informed her.</p> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d She arched a brow. \u201cYou shock me.\u201d</p><p>His fingers stroked down the line of her throat, relishing the feel of her smooth skin. \u201cI have a way we could pass the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re covered in mud,\u201d she chided, but he didn\u2019t miss the tiny spark of heat deep in her eyes.</p><p>He leaned down to brush his lips along the curve of her ear. \u201cThere\u2019s a creek just over the hill,\u201d he told her, his superior hearing able to catch the sound of shallow water as it danced over rocks. It was all too easy to imagine stripping off Nefri\u2019s clothes so she could play mermaid. \u201cYou could wash me.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, the rich scent of her arousal lacing the breeze. \u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p> <p>He nipped the lobe of her ear, careful not to draw blood. His possessive fascination with the female was enough to deal with at the moment.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to take the risk of mating her.</p><p>Not when she might disappear back behind the Veil.</p><p>He\u2019d been abandoned by his sire and then again by this female just a few weeks ago.

His hands gripped her waist, but before he could yank her hard against his stirring body, a warning prickle brushed over his skin.</p><p>On instant alert, Santiago stepped back far enough to pull his sword free. The air felt charged with electricity, as if lightning was about to strike.</p><p>Not a vampire\u2019s favorite sensation.</p><p>Being flammable had a few downsides.</p><p>When lightning didn\u2019t strike him down, he began to lower his sword, his puzzled gaze searching the meadow.

Still, he wasn\u2019t prepared for the massive jewel to abruptly disappear at the same time the tree split in half.</p><p>\u201cMeirda,\u201d he muttered, staring at the black hole that hovered in the space between the two halves of the tree. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA doorway.\u201d Nefri sent him a warning glance as she moved forward. \u201cStay close.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly he fell into step behind her. \u201cWe\u2019re not about to tumble into some weird version of Wonderland, are we?\u201d</p><p>She gave a soft snort. \u201cWeird version?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, the first version was pretty weird,\u201d he conceded, his knuckles white as he gripped the hilt of his sword.</p><p>Like any self-respecting vampire, he detested magic. And there was no mistaking that the black hole was made by magic, not nature. But, gritting his teeth, he forced his feet to carry him forward.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t he been the one to insist on joining Nefri? He couldn\u2019t back down now.</p><p>Shivering as they moved through the darkness, Santiago nearly stumbled over his own feet as they stepped into what looked like a throne room in a grand palace.</p><p>Startled, his gaze skimmed over the long, highly glossed floor of inlaid wood that was framed by ivory walls inset with arched mirrors. Above his head the coved ceiling displayed an exquisite mural of Aladdin and his lamp that came to life in the blaze of light from the massive chandelier.</p><p>At the far end of the room was a gilded throne with crimson velvet padding that was set on a high dais. On each side of the dais were a matching set of ivory and gold double doors.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d he asked in confusion.</p><p>Nefri continued toward the throne, her air of nobility only emphasized by her elegant surroundings. Regal, a voice whispered in the back of his mind.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small fold in dimensions,\u201d she murmured softly.</p><p>\u201cA fold?\u201d He followed several steps behind Nefri, giving himself room for a full swing of his sword if they were attacked. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of it.\u201d</p><p>She slowed her steps, perhaps considering how best to explain the strange phenomenon. \u201cYou know that Laylah found the babies hidden in what she called a \u2018bubble\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard the stories.\u201d</p><p>She waved a slender hand. \u201cThis is basically the same, only on a larger scale.\u201d</p><p>He frowned as he glanced around the room, realizing the opening had closed behind them.</p><p>Trapped.</p><p>A very elegant sally port.</p><p>He shuddered, far from happy by the knowledge he had no easy exit.</p><p>\u201cSo are we in another dimension?\u201d</p><p>She again considered her words. \u201cWe\u2019re in a sliver of space where our worlds intersect with one another.\u201d</p><p>Santiago grimaced. He hadn\u2019t considered the possibilities that dimensions overlapped one another. Hell, he hadn\u2019t spent any time thinking about other dimensions at all. He was a warrior, not a philosopher. But now that he considered Nefri\u2019s explanation, it made sense.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know it was here?\u201d</p><p>She came to a halt a few steps from the empty throne, her hand absently stroking the medallion hung around her neck. It was a gesture that revealed she was more nervous than she wanted to admit.</p><p>\u201cI devoted a number of years to studying obscure histories and forgotten languages,\u201d she said, her tone distracted. \u201cIn one I discovered the rumors of a . . .\u201d</p><p>He shifted back to study his companion\u2019s perfect profile. \u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to translate, but I suppose the nearest description would be hall of records.\u201d She shrugged, her explanation smooth. Too smooth. She was hiding something from him. \u201cOr a library, if you prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI crawled through the muck to come to a library?\u201d</p><p>She turned to meet his chiding gaze. \u201cWhere else do you go when you need information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoogle?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cGoogle doesn\u2019t have the answers we need.\u201d</p><p>He pointed a sword toward the mirrored walls that were markedly devoid of books. As far as he could see, it looked more like a room Paris Hilton would choose, not a scholar.</p><p>There was something she wasn\u2019t telling him.</p><p>\u201cAnd this place does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe actual texts are protected by a very special guardian. We must wait for an invitation to go further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d He rolled his tight shoulders. He wanted out of the strange fold in space; it felt too much like a trap. \u201cI\u2019m still curious about how you found this place. Did one of your texts have a map?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>Hmmm. What the hell was she hiding?</p><p>A familiar warning flared through his blood, distracting him from the suspicion that he should have asked a lot more questions before entering Wonderland.</p><p>\u201cYou do know that dawn is only an hour away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be safe here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>About to remind her that she\u2019d given up the right to trust when she\u2019d disappeared on him without a word, he caught a faint scent wafting beneath the doors.</p><p>Tilting back his head, Santiago tested the air, his predatory senses on full alert. \u201cDo you smell that?\u201d</p><p>Nefri gave a calm nod. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMierda.\u201d Santiago\u2019s eyes widened in shock. \u201cDo you have a death-wish?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Nefri was an ancient vampire of immeasurable strength and a clan chief who\u2019d led her people for centuries with a combination of compassion and a shrewd intelligence.</p><p>Among many, she was considered almost a god.</p><p>But she was also a woman. And she wasn\u2019t above taking pleasure in the sight of Santiago\u2019s stunned disbelief. He was always so damned arrogantly confident.</p><p>Not that she blamed him for his reaction. Dragons would make any demon run in the opposite direction.</p><p>Even the mighty vampires.</p><p>Not only were dragons capable of destroying their enemies by breathing fires that reached nuclear-level status, but they possessed magic as old and powerful as the universe.</p><p>The only good thing was that the rare, reclusive creatures had little interest in the mortal world, and often disappeared for several millennia at a time.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to get excited,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He stared at her as if she was demented. A legitimate hypothesis, she wryly accepted, shivering as icy prickles teased over her skin.</p><p>Any female would have to be insane to be more distracted by a sexy vampire who was arousing her with nothing more than the brush of his power, than the approaching dragon who could roast her with an accidental burp.</p><p>\u201cYou bring me to a dragon\u2019s hoard and you tell me not to get excited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will never find a larger collection of ancient texts,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cYeah, guarded by a lethal, bat-crazy lizard who can charbroil us with a yawn.\u201d</p><p>Nefri stilled, abruptly puzzled by Santiago\u2019s reaction. \u201cI\u2019m surprised.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat I let myself be led to certain death?\u201d he muttered. \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that you so easily accepted my explanation.\u201d She studied his unreasonably beautiful face. \u201cMost demons no longer believe in dragons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuring my years in the pits I was locked in the catacombs with a number of interesting demons, including a clan chief.\u201d His smile was without humor. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what a person will reveal when they face death on a nightly basis.\u201d</p> <p>Nefri gave a slow nod. Clan chiefs were strongly discouraged from discussing the trials they endured, even with each other. No doubt in an attempt to add mystery to the process of becoming a chief.</p><p>But there were always exceptions. Including Nefri, who didn\u2019t hesitate to question chiefs on their own experiences.</p><p>\u201cAh, he revealed the secrets of the battles of Durotriges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly small bits and pieces.\u201d Santiago gave a lift of his shoulder. \u201cHe claimed he fought a dragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my hypothesis that the creature was a half-breed. Which meant . . .\u201d She waved a hand to indicate their elegant surroundings.</p> <p>\u201cThat there must be a full breed around somewhere,\u201d he easily followed her implication.</p><p>\u201cOne who could enter this world,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least, that was the hypothesis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hypotheses tend to have an uncanny habit of being proven right.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. During her battle with the strange lizardlike creature with leathery wings who\u2019d nearly barbecued her during her last trial, she\u2019d become convinced there had to be some truth to the ancient rumors of dragons. Unfortunately, the folklore of the beast had become so twisted over the centuries it was almost impossible to discover what was truth and what was myth.</p><p>\u201cThis one was more difficult than others to prove one way or another. There\u2019s very little information on dragons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about other clan chiefs?\u201d he demanded. \u201cSurely they must have investigated the truth of dragons if they had to fight them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom the few chiefs who would discuss their trials, I learned that the battles are never the same for any of us.\u201d That was an understatement. The trials were so wildly different for each combatant that Nefri had wondered if they actually were sent to different places. Then, she\u2019d become convinced they all went to the same place only at different times. She couldn\u2019t prove her theory, of course, but the idea that the battlegrounds floated in a different space-time continuum was the only thing that made sense.</p><p>\u201cI have only heard of one other clan chief who claimed dragons existed. Unfortunately he disappeared before I could discover if his belief came from Durotriges or from some other source.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he was my unfortunate roommate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI searched through the ancient texts,\u201d she said. \u201cThen after I learned all that was written about the mysterious creatures, I used my medallion to search for a doorway. It took several centuries, but eventually I discovered this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did.\u201d</p><p>The low voice filled the air as the double doors to the right of the throne flew open to reveal the creature of myth and legend.</p> <p>Surprisingly, Baine\u2019s human form wasn\u2019t as large as might be expected for a monster who could supposedly transform into a flying lizard with a forty-foot wingspan and an elongated body that weighed in at over a ton. In the past, the Lu demon had often been mistaken for a dragon since it shared the same scaled head with its long snout and mouthful of razor teeth; not to mention they were impossible to kill without magic. But the Lu was half the size of the mythical dragons and they couldn\u2019t shape-shift.</p><p>This particular dragon had chosen a leanly muscular human male body with a narrow face that had delicate, Asian features. His straight black hair fell just short of his shoulders and he was wearing nothing more than a pair of loose dojo pants that allowed a dizzying view of the numerous tattoos that glowed with a metallic shimmer beneath the light of the chandelier. More unnerving, the strange symbols changed colors as they crawled over his pale, perfect skin.</p><p>Almost as if they were alive.</p><p>It was beautiful, hypnotizing. And so distracting that it was all too easy to forget just how lethal this creature truly was.</p><p>At least until you looked into the almond-shaped eyes burning with an amber fire that spoke of vast, primordial magic.</p><p>Enough magic to scorch the world.</p><p>\u201cPor dios,\u201d Santiago growled, and Nefri instinctively stepped between him and the advancing dragon.</p><p>Two alpha males in the same room was always a pain in the neck.</p><p>Folding her hands at her waist, Nefri offered a respectful bow. \u201cBaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNefri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for accepting my humble offering.\u201d</p><p>The dragon held up his slender fingers to reveal the large diamond that shimmered with a white fire. \u201cYou know I can never resist pretty baubles. And I was . . . intrigued.\u201d A hint of a smile curved his lips as he tucked the diamond into the pocket of his loose pants. \u201cYou are one of the few demons brave enough to enter the lair of a dragon.\u201d</p><p>Santiago shifted to stand at her side, his expression tight as he braced himself against the heavy throb of Baine\u2019s power. It was like the constant beat of a bass drum, pulsing through the air with enough force to make the floor tremble beneath his feet.</p><p>\u201cBrave isn\u2019t the word I would use,\u201d the male vampire pointedly chastised.</p><p>The scorching gaze turned toward Santiago, and Nefri tensed. For now Baine was enjoying his role as beneficent host, but dragons were rumored to be fickle and vain with a quicksilver temper.</p><p>Who knew when he might decide he was no longer amused?</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d he demanded of Santiago.</p><p>\u201cThis is\u2014\u201d Nefri cut off her words as Baine gave a sharp wave of his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hear it from the male.\u201d</p><p>Nefri bit her lip. Naturally, Santiago couldn\u2019t offer a bow, or even lower his eyes as Baine slowly circled his rigid body. Instead he tilted his chin and subtly tightened his grip on his sword.</p><p>Stubborn vampire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Santiago,\u201d he said, his voice clear and steady.</p><p>Baine came to a halt directly in front of him, the amber eyes smoldering with an inner fire. \u201cYou don\u2019t fear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Santiago shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d</p><p>The dragon\u2019s tattoos continued to swirl over his body in a dazzling display. \u201cYou disguise it better than most,\u201d Baine murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Baine sucked in a deep breath, as if savoring their scents. \u201cSuch a violent world you live in.\u201d</p><p>Santiago took a wise step backward at the hungry edge in the dragon\u2019s voice. \u201cIt keeps me on my toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d The dragon\u2019s smile widened. In anticipation? Difficult to say. \u201cI miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe violence?\u201d Santiago asked.</p><p>\u201cThe violence. The blood.\u201d Baine moved with lightning speed to stand nose to nose with Santiago. \u201cThe crunch of vampire bones in my teeth.\u201d</p><p>Nefri took a swift step forward, laying a restraining hand on the dragon\u2019s arm. Almost instantly she yanked it back, her fingers tingling with pain from the heat generated by his skin.</p><p>Good lord, it was like touching an open flame.</p><p>\u201cBaine,\u201d she murmured in urgent tones.</p><p>There was a tense beat as the two alphas met stare for stare, then with a throaty chuckle Baine at last turned to meet her concerned gaze.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t play with your toy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to seek your assistance.\u201d</p><p>Baine shrugged, thankfully stepping away from the bristling male vampire.</p><p>Santiago was one goad away from doing something truly stupid.</p><p>\u201cI am always delighted to be of service to a beautiful female, but I no longer interest myself in your world,\u201d Baine informed her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually your knowledge of the past I seek.\u201d</p><p>The dragon paused, inwardly debating her request. At the same time Nefri discreetly moved close enough to make it impossible for Santiago to take an impulsive swing of his sword. He might be more annoying than any vampire had a right to be, but she wasn\u2019t going to let him die.</p><p>Eventually, Baine gave a languid wave of his hand. \u201cYou may continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need information on a spirit who can infect a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Baine tilted his head, eyeing her with a sudden curiosity. Which, of course, was better than hunger.</p><p>Just slightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such a spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps a book in your collection . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the information was available in my library I would know.\u201d He deliberately stroked a finger over the swirling tattoos on his stomach. \u201cDragons have very long memories.\u201d</p><p>Nefri bit her bottom lip. Well that was . . . disappointing. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me more of this spirit.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. Siljar wouldn\u2019t be pleased to know that Nefri had shared the details of the MIA spirit with Santiago, let alone a dragon, but what choice did she have? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The closer they came to locating Gaius, the more she realized they needed information.

Not when Santiago might be harmed.</p> <p>Thrusting aside the vulnerable thought, she met the fiery dragon gaze. \u201cIt was contained by the Oracles by a rift in space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>Santiago moved to stand directly behind her shoulder at Baine\u2019s sharp tone, but he was smart enough to keep the sword at his side.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an exact date,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut it was when the world was still young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Veil,\u201d Baine murmured.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>An odd purring filled the air. Not the cute purring of a kitten, but the lethal vibration of an irritated dragon.</p><p>\u201cI should have suspected the idiots were hiding something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo love lost for the Commission?\u201d Santiago demanded.</p><p>A tiny wisp of smoke curled from one nostril, revealing the dragon\u2019s opinion of the ultimate leaders of demon kind.</p><p>\u201cThey have tried to pass themselves off as impartial judges who rule the demon world with no thought beyond justice.\u201d He made a sound of disgust. \u201cWhen the truth is much less noble.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely no love lost,\u201d Santiago muttered.</p><p>Nefri studied Baine\u2019s finely carved features, sensing his dislike of the Oracles was more personal than irritation with their positions of authority.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t aware of why they created the Veil?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Another wisp of smoke. \u201cTell me more of the creature.\u201d</p><p>She felt the light skim of Santiago\u2019s fingers down the curve of her spine. As if she needed the silent warning to be careful. The very air was heating with Baine\u2019s rising temper.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately I know little more than it was dangerous enough to prompt the Oracles to bar it from the mortal world,\u201d she carefully confessed. \u201cAnd that it\u2019s currently traveling with a vampire named Gaius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe the vampire is infected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaius seems capable of spreading intense emotions among the humans with his bite. Fear, violence, lust . . .\u201d She shook her head in frustration. Until she understood how and why he was infecting humans, she couldn\u2019t risk coming into contact with him. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a deliberate act or a symptom of his own sickness.\u201d</p> <p>The amber eyes widened, as if her words had startled the dragon. Rather amazing considering the beast was rumored to be older than the world and possessed the knowledge of thousands of species.</p><p>Then, without warning, a mysterious smile was curling his lips. \u201cIntense emotion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs something funny?\u201d Santiago growled.</p><p>Turning with a sinuous motion, Baine paced across the narrow room, his chuckle sending a rash of unease over Nefri\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cIt really is the perfect irony,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cDo you know this spirit?\u201d Nefri asked.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to share?\u201d Santiago snapped.</p><p>Nefri elbowed him with enough force to make him wince in pain.</p><p>\u201cSantiago,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Baine slowly turned back. \u201cI must consider what I\u2019m prepared to reveal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Nefri dipped her head in respect. \u201cWe would appreciate any information you can share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver the diplomat, eh, beautiful Nefri?\u201d Baine drawled.</p><p>Nefri shot a chiding glance toward the vampire still scowling at her side. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary when surrounded by impetuous males who love to flex their muscles.\u201d</p><p>Baine sent a mocking glance toward Santiago, at the same time waving a slender hand toward the double doors on the opposite side of the throne. With a faint squeak one door swung slowly inward, as if it hadn\u2019t been opened in centuries.</p><p>\u201cThe hallway leads to a private suite,\u201d Baine told her. \u201cWe will speak again when I\u2019ve made my decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing her companion by the arm, she led him toward the door before he could demand the dragon tell them what he knew.</p><p>There was nothing they could say or do to force Baine to speak. Not even the Hope Diamond could sway him.</p><p>For now they would have to wait until he decided they were worthy of his secrets.</p><p>And pray that it didn\u2019t take until the next millennium.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Santiago allowed Nefri to lead him down the long, shadowed hallway. Not that he was happy about it.</p><p>A dragon. A freaking dragon.</p><p>Like it wasn\u2019t bad enough to be chasing a mysterious spirit and his crazy-ass sire who could infect humans. Now he was trapped in the lair of a dragon.</p><p>\u201cYou have a habit of collecting dangerous friends, cara,\u201d he growled, his wary gaze trying to focus on the paneled walls that seemed to waver in and out of focus. As if they were walking through the strange corridors between dimensions.</p><p>Nefri had the nerve to send him a puzzled frown. \u201cDangerous?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cDragons, Oracles . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaine is hardly a friend,\u201d she interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cAnd the Oracles?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m nothing more than a lowly servant for the Commission.\u201d</p><p>This proud, beautiful woman a servant?</p><p>Yeah, and stars were mere specks in the sky.</p><p>Santiago lifted a hand to brush his fingers down the cool silk of her hair. \u201cYou may have been forced to do things against your will, querida, but you have never been a servant. Not to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fine distinction,\u201d she murmured, although there was a hint of appreciation in the dark, velvet eyes as she halted at a door that abruptly appeared from the shadows. Pausing for a brief second, she reached for the knob and pushed the thick wood door open and stepped over the threshold. Then, with a startled sound, she came to a sudden halt. \u201cGood . . . lord.\u201d</p><p>Without thought, Santiago had his sword lifted and was moving past Nefri to confront whatever had caused her astonishment.</p><p>What he found was . . . nothing.</p><p>At least, nothing beyond a circular room with a domed ceiling that was decorated with paintings of tiny cupids at play. Inlaid with narrow bands of gold, the floor was made of marble that was polished until it glowed beneath a Venetian chandelier.</p><p>The walls were the same marble, but veined with a pale green that matched the velvet upholstery on the chaise lounge near a built-in armoire, as well as the comforter on the large, canopy bed set in the center of the room.</p><p>A little too pretentious for his taste, but he would have bet his last dollar it was perfectly suited to Nefri.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he rasped, stepping further into the room, his gaze searching for a hidden enemy.</p><p>She moved to stand at his side, her expression wary. \u201cThis is an exact replica of my private rooms.\u201d</p><p>Santiago hissed, his mind instantly consumed with the image of the handsome, lethal predator prowling through Nefri\u2019s most intimate territory. \u201cBaine\u2019s been in your bedroom?\u201d</p><p>Her brows lifted at his snarled question, the temperature dropping by several degrees. \u201cThat\u2019s your concern? Whether or not Baine\u2019s been in my bedroom?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t stupid. He knew there was something wrong with his logic. But beyond being a warrior or a vampire, he was a man. And men didn\u2019t think clearly when they were obsessed with a particular woman. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cNo, Santiago, I didn\u2019t entertain a dragon in my bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how is this possible?\u201d he demanded, his gaze taking in each detail of the classically graceful room.</p><p>Again he was struck by just how suited it was to Nefri\u2019s regal yet understated beauty. It was all too easy to imagine her lying on the bed, her hair spread like a river of ebony across the green velvet cover.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s uncanny.\u201d Nefri moved to run a hand over a Chinese vase that stood as tall as Santiago.</p><p>Compelled by his own need to make sure his eyes weren\u2019t deceiving him, Santiago stepped forward to grasp the wooden post of the bed. He could feel the sanded grains beneath his fingers, just as he could catch the scent of polish.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this sliver of another dimension doesn\u2019t overlap the Veil?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, this is an illusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA damned real illusion.\u201d</p><p>She crossed to pull open the armoire, revealing several long robes that she preferred to wear when she was among her clansmen. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Santiago narrowed his eyes. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain how the dragon knew what your bedroom looked like. Or what you wear when you\u2019re home alone.\u201d</p><p>She closed the door of the armoire with a controlled bang, turning to meet his suspicious gaze. \u201cEither he took the image from my thoughts or somehow I\u2019m manipulating the illusion to reflect my preferences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour preference, but not mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your point?\u201d</p><p>Point? He didn\u2019t have a point, dammit. \u201cIt just seems odd.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to waste my energy trying to convince you that Baine is not and never has been my lover.\u201d A cold blast of power rattled the silver candelabra. \u201cQuite frankly my past is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>A wave of possessive satisfaction flared through him at the fierce sincerity in her sharp reprimand. A satisfaction that was swiftly followed by the knowledge he was behaving like an ass.</p><p>Again.</p> <p>With an effort, he reengaged his brain. \u201cI know that,\u201d he admitted with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you pouting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the thought of any other man touching you makes me want to punch something,\u201d he said. \u201cReally, really hard.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at his blunt confession. \u201cThat makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>He moved with fluid speed to stand directly before her, his hand reaching to cup her cheek. Beneath his fingers her skin was cool, but the feel of the satin smoothness sent licks of flame through his body.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze lowered to his lengthening fangs. \u201cSantiago.\u201d</p><p>He stroked his thumb over her lower lip. \u201cI need a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me stop you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her stiff tone. She could glare daggers if she wanted, but he could already catch the sweet musk of her arousal.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to wash my own back, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m annoyed with you.\u201d</p><p>His thumb tugged at her lower lip, allowing him to view the tips of her fully extended fangs.</p><p>The thought of them sinking into his flesh was enough to make him so hard it was painful. Dios. He needed to be inside this woman.</p><p>Now!</p><p>\u201cCan you be annoyed with me in the shower?\u201d he demanded thickly.</p><p>She nipped his thumb, her eyes darkening with the same hunger that thundered through him. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Santiago lowered his head, touching their lips together in the lightest of caresses. \u201cJasmine silk,\u201d he murmured as he caught her lower lip between his teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder I can\u2019t think straight. You have me completely befuddled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou blame me?\u201d Her lips moved against his as she spoke.</p> <p>He gently outlined her mouth with his tongue. \u201cI\u2019m not complaining. I like it very, very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSantiago . . .\u201d</p><p>Her hands lifted as if she was going to put a swift end to his seduction and Santiago gave a low groan. Dios. He could feel her need. He could feel it tugging at things hidden deep in his soul.</p><p>But she was so determined to remain isolated behind her barriers that even accepting his desire became a battle.</p><p>Braced for her rejection, he wasn\u2019t prepared when her hands instead slid beneath his sweatshirt to trace over the tense muscles of his chest.</p><p>He clenched his jaw in delicious agony. Her touch was little more than a brush of her fingers, but it was enough to send a white-hot jolt of pleasure through his body.</p><p>\u201cNefri,\u201d he whispered, his kiss deepening with blatant greed.</p><p>A tiny voice might warn this was a hollow victory, but his body was eager to accept whatever she was willing to offer.</p><p>Trust, loyalty.</p><p>Genuine emotion?</p><p>He had never wanted or needed those things from a lover before. So why now?</p><p>Impatiently ripping off his shirt, Santiago wound his fingers through the satin softness of her hair and pressed impatient kisses over her upturned face. He wanted to taste every inch of her slender body. To wrap himself in her jasmine scent until they were both drowning in satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cNefri, I need to have you naked,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI want to feel your skin against mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is madness,\u201d she muttered as he peeled the sweater over her head and tossed it onto the floor.</p><p>He regarded her with a wry smile, his hand cupping her full breasts and his thumb gently teasing a nipple into a tight bud.</p><p>No bra. He liked it.</p><p>A lot.</p><p>\u201cMadness perhaps, but I no longer care,\u201d Santiago muttered as he lowered his head to close his lips around the tip of her nipple.</p><p>Nefri made a soft sound of surrender as she dug her nails into his shoulders, her body instinctively arching in silent invitation.</p><p>Santiago didn\u2019t hesitate. Tormenting her sensitive flesh with his tongue, he skimmed his hands down the curve of her waist. She tasted of cool power and sweet woman. An intoxicating combination, he decided as he easily dealt with the zip of her jeans and slid them down her hips.</p><p>With a last lingering taste of her nipple, he trailed his lips down the curve of her breast. Then, with a fluid grace he lowered himself to his knees, allowing the tips of his fangs to lightly caress the skin over her taut belly. She shivered, her fingers roughly tugging his hair out of its braid as he pulled her jeans downward, surprised to discover the tiny wisp of lacy . . . what were those under-thingies called?</p><p>Panties. Yes, his fogged mind acknowledged. That was it.</p><p>Panties.</p><p>Hmmm. Tasty.</p><p>Reaching down he yanked off her shoes so he could get rid of the jeans. Tossing them aside, he paused to simply appreciate her exquisite beauty.</p><p>The bit of lace only served to wet his appetite. Like a bow on a much anticipated gift.</p><p>And it was a gift.</p><p>The most precious gift.</p><p>Grasping her hips, he leaned forward to nibble along the edge of the panties. He smiled as she yanked at his hair, her soft groan sweet music to his ears.</p><p>\u201cGood lord,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Tilting back his head, he met Nefri\u2019s smoldering black gaze, her features tight with a stark desire.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d he husked.</p><p>\u201cI . . . yes.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed a chuckle at her rare loss for words and instead lowered his head to slice through the tiny string of her panties with a razor-sharp fang. Barely waiting for the bit of lace to hit the floor, he was tugging her legs further apart to nuzzle a path down her inner leg.</p><p>Slowly he explored the curve of her knee, the muscle of her calf, and the delicate joint of her ankle. At last reaching the tips of her toes, he moved to reverse the same service up the other leg.</p><p>\u201cSantiago, are you deliberately trying to torture me?\u201d she demanded in thick tones.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve promised myself I\u2019m going to taste every inch of you,\u201d he said, recalling every restless day he\u2019d lain awake, haunted by the memory of this woman.</p><p>Unaware of his dark thoughts, Nefri shifted restlessly beneath his lingering touch. \u201cEnough . . . please.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he at last sought out the tender flesh that begged for his touch. \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d</p><p>His tongue parted her, searching for the spot that made her hips jerk forward, and her toes curl.</p><p>\u201cSantiago,\u201d she groaned.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>He spread her even further as he teased the tiny nub hidden in the soft folds. Her fingers stroked restlessly through his hair, the scent of jasmine filling his senses.</p><p>His erection threatened to self-combust at the drugging scent, but with ruthless determination he concentrated on Nefri\u2019s tiny shivers. He wanted the taste of her orgasm on his tongue.</p><p>Only then would he seek his own pleasure.</p><p>Sliding his hands upward, he teased at the hardened peaks of her breasts while his tongue began a steady stroke that had her groaning in quickening anticipation.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop . . .\u201d she commanded, her voice unsteady as her head tilted back in mindless need.</p><p>Stop?</p><p>Hell, a tribe of rabid trolls couldn\u2019t make him stop.</p><p>Sensing her muscles clenching in anticipation, he gave her one long, last stroke that sent her screaming over the edge.</p><p>Holding her hips in a ruthless grip, he coaxed her to yet another climax before he was rising upward and swiftly carrying her toward the bed.</p><p>Tumbling her into the center of the mattress, he followed her downward and positioned himself above her while she was still trembling with her release. Thrusting deep, he claimed her lips in a kiss of sheer possession.</p><p>His eyes closed and a moan was wrenched from his throat.</p><p>This was sheer paradise.</p><p>The slender female body that fit beneath him with absolute perfection. The feel of her slender hands as they swept down his back to grasp his hips. And the potent pulse of her outrageous power.</p><p>This was a woman like no other.</p><p>Rare.</p><p>Exceptional.</p><p>And . . . his.</p><p>With a slow movement he pulled out to his very tip before thrusting back into her silken body. Dios, but he was lost.</p><p>Completely and utterly ruined for any other woman.</p><p>Burying his face in the curve of her neck, Santiago pistoned his hips over and over, keeping his pace steady as she wrapped her legs around his waist. Her nails bit into his skin as she met him thrust for thrust, heightening his pleasure.</p><p>The climax was building and he lifted his head to press tiny kisses over her face.</p><p>\u201cNefri, I can\u2019t wait,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she muttered, cupping his face in her hands as he plunged within her.</p><p>He managed to hold on until he could feel her ripples of satisfaction clenching him, then with a last groan, he lost himself in the fierce orgasm that ripped away all pretense and left him with the unshakable knowledge his life would never be the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just north of Chicago</p><p>Sally woke with a throbbing head and a nasty premonition that she was ass-deep in trouble.</p><p>Like a coward she kept her eyes squeezed shut and tried to will herself back to sleep. If something bad was coming, why be conscious for it?</p> <p>Unfortunately, she was sprawled on a hard cement floor that was giving her a cramp in the neck. And since whatever might be lurking in the dark didn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry to kill her, she grudgingly forced her heavy lids to lift.</p><p>She grimaced. On the up side, the large unoccupied room was thankfully empty of a ravaging horde. On the down side, it was coated in a thick layer of dust that now covered her from head to toe.</p><p>Stifling a sneeze, she managed to rise to her feet, pressing a hand to her aching temple.</p><p>Where the hell was she?</p><p>And more importantly, how did she get there?</p> <p>Her gaze skimmed over the brick walls and the windows that had been boarded over. The floor was cement and the lofted ceiling lined with steel beams.</p><p>A warehouse? A closed factory?</p><p>Taking a hesitant step forward, she desperately tried to remember what had happened. She\u2019d been traveling through the tunnel with Roke, right? And then they\u2019d come to the end of the tunnel even as her powers were running on empty.</p><p>What then? Vaguely she recalled Roke leaving to search the building overhead.</p><p>Had he abandoned her? Or had something happened to him? Was he hurt?</p><p>Or worse . . . ?</p> <p>Before the disturbing thoughts could fully form, she was shaking her aching head. No. He\u2019d come back. Yes. That was right. He\u2019d come back and . . .</p><p>Her heart slammed painfully against her breastbone. Oh, crap.</p><p>He\u2019d come back ready to murder her.</p><p>So had he succeeded? Was this her version of hell? An eternity alone in an empty, dusty warehouse?</p><p>It could be worse, she decided, heading toward the steel door across the barren room. She could be stuck with an arrogant bully of a vampire who had gone from loathing to downright hatred.</p><p>Almost as if the thought of Roke stirred some primitive connection to him, Sally came to a slow halt.</p><p>She sensed him. Not just physically, although she would swear she could feel the icy prickles of his power brushing over her skin.</p><p>But somewhere deep inside her.</p> <p>Her mouth went dry as she glanced around the shadowed room. \u201cHello?\u201d Her voice echoed eerily through the darkness, bouncing off the walls. \u201cIs anyone there?\u201d</p><p>There was the faintest swish of sound before a dark shape was falling from the rafters. She instinctively leaped backward as the shadow revealed itself as Roke.</p><p>Holy crap.</p><p>Had he been hanging up there like a bat?</p><p>With a chilling smile, he folded his arms over his chest. He was still wearing the black jeans and leather jacket from earlier, but his dark hair lay as smooth as polished silk framing his stark, disgustingly handsome face.</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere, witch?\u201d he mocked, the pale eyes glowing white in the dim light.</p><p>\u201cRoke,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cYes, Roke.\u201d His power bit into her skin like tiny shards of ice. \u201cYour devoted love-slave.\u201d</p><p>She winced, rubbing her hands over her arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but I promise you\u2019re going to be.\u201d</p><p>She believed him. The threat of violence was a tangible force. She shivered, hoping he would at least make her death quick.</p><p>\u201cI . . . it wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d</p><p>He curled back his lips to reveal a set of fangs that looked massive to Sally.</p><p>And deadly.</p><p>And . . . painful. Really, really painful.</p><p>\u201cTell me exactly what you did to me,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward, leaning down until they were nose to nose. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d She stumbled back, her heart racing with a fear that threatened to consume her. \u201cI can\u2019t think when you\u2019re looming over me like some avenging angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel?\u201d He gave a derisive snort. \u201cThat\u2019s a first.\u201d</p><p>She held up a pleading hand. \u201cJust back off and I\u2019ll tell whatever you want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d With a glare he took a deliberate step backward, his expression carved in granite. \u201cTalk fast.\u201d</p><p>She cleared the lump from her throat, struggling to think through the panic clouding her mind. \u201cUnless it was a part of my nightmare, you already know I\u2019m not entirely human,\u201d she managed to rasp.</p><p>\u201cYou refused to tell me what blood runs in your veins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I truly don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>The pale, unnerving eyes narrowed. \u201cConvenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvenient. Yeah, real convenient.\u201d Her short burst of laughter echoed eerily through the room. \u201cMy mother was a witch, and before you ask, yes, she practiced black magic,\u201d she bitterly admitted. She\u2019d devoted a lot of energy to burying the memories of her mother. The last thing she wanted was to dig them up and relive them. \u201cShe was, in fact, everything that people fear most in witches. She was vain, selfish, and willing to sacrifice everything for power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA black witch.\u201d He shuddered in disgust.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she hissed, absently rubbing her inner arm. The dang thing still itched. \u201cI knew you would be suitably horrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mystery.\u201d</p><p>He growled in warning. \u201cSally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done,\u201d she snapped, her terror not enough to halt her burst of anger. Did the damned vampire want her story or not?</p><p>\u201cThen finish,\u201d he commanded in icy tones.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she slugged him in the nose when she had him in her power?</p><p>\u201cAfter decades of making enemies my mother decided she needed to expand her power base,\u201d she said through clenched teeth. \u201cOr at least that\u2019s what she always claimed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t she have a coven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did, but she could never really trust that they wouldn\u2019t stage a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d Sally grimaced. Her mother had been as paranoid as she was power hungry. No doubt because everyone hated her guts. \u201cShe wanted a partner of absolute, unquestioning loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive the vampire a gold star,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>There was another flash of fang. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to be a smart-ass.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t. Unfortunately, the more nervous she became the more mouthy she tended to be.</p><p>\u201cYes, a daughter,\u201d she forced herself to answer in reasonable tones. No sense antagonizing the already infuriated vampire. \u201cOr more specifically, me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she chose a demon to impregnate her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood god, no.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cMy mother had a pathological hatred of demons.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, almost as if he were offended by her confession. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because demons spend a great deal of time trying to kill witches,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>He shrugged aside her accusation. Typical. Vampires were allowed to go around killing willy-nilly, but they weren\u2019t so happy when they were the prey.</p><p>\u201cThen how did a demon end up in her bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I could discover my mother performed a secret fertility rite that would not only make sure she would become pregnant, but would lead her to the best candidate to be the\u201d\u2014she felt a ridiculous blush stain her cheeks\u2014\u201cdonor.\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted. \u201cAnd it led her to a demon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cAnd beyond just being a demon, it had to be skillful enough to hide the fact it wasn\u2019t human from a very powerful witch. Not an easy task.\u201d</p><p>He studied her for several seconds. \u201cDidn\u2019t your mother try to track him down after she discovered the truth?\u201d</p><p>With an abrupt motion she turned away from his piercing gaze. Her raw sense of betrayal was something she wasn\u2019t willing to share.</p><p>Certainly not with a vampire who wanted her dead.</p><p>\u201cIt took several years before she actually learned the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t realize when you were born?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was one of those half-breeds who didn\u2019t start showing my demon blood until I hit puberty.\u201d She hunched a shoulder, her stomach cramping at the agonizing memory. \u201cNeedless to say, my sweet sixteenth birthday is one I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d His voice sounded odd. Tense.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does if it helps me determine what sort of demon you are.\u201d</p><p>God almighty. He truly was a masochist.</p><p>\u201cYou want the gory details?\u201d She whirled back to glare at his carefully blank face. \u201cOkay. I was assisting my mother with a spell that demanded a blood sacrifice, so I sliced open my palm. I\u2019d done it a hundred times, but this time . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt healed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, just like magic.\u201d Her lips twisted. She could still remember every detail of that moment. The smell of smoke from the candles protecting their circle. The sound of her blood dripping on the wood floor. The hiss of horror from the woman who\u2019d raised her as the wound had slowly sealed shut. \u201cOnly it wasn\u2019t magic. It was a death sentence.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was still wondering why the heck my hand was healing when my mother hit me with a spell that was intended to eviscerate me on the spot.

She didn\u2019t cry for that terrified girl who\u2019d fled the cottage that night. Not anymore. \u201cIronic, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIronic?\u201d Something dangerous smoldered in the depths of his pale eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a damned mess.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 17</p><p>Roke glared at the female who continued to screw with his emotions.</p><p>Why else would he be feeling pity for her?

And I\u2019m stronger than most women.\u201d She shoved her fingers through her tangled hair, her expression one of self-derision. \u201cOh, and I think I might be aging slower, unless I just have really good genes.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, trying to ignore just how vulnerable she looked with her pale face covered with dust and the purple shadows beneath her eyes.</p><p>This female was his enemy.</p> <p>Period.</p><p>\u201cAnd you can compel others to your will?\u201d he snarled.</p><p>She flinched. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain exactly what it is you do.\u201d</p><p>She heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cOver the past few years I discovered I can, on a rare occasion\u2014a very rare occasion,\u201d she emphasized, \u201cI can influence someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInfluence?\u201d</p><p>She nervously licked her lips, the tiny gesture sending a jarring bolt of desire through him.</p><p>Christ, he had to get rid of the spell.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll admit that it seems to be increasing in potency, but I swear I didn\u2019t think for a minute that it would actually work on a vampire.\u201d She shivered, rubbing her arm as if it bothered her. \u201cI was just so desperate I had to try something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesperate?\u201d He shrugged off her lame excuse. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. Why would you be desperate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d She gave a shake of her head. \u201cI was locked in a dungeon with the threat that a demented vampire who I narced on might track me down at any second.\u201d</p><p>The tiny pang he felt was not guilt.</p><p>It was . . . contempt.</p><p>If she was so terrified of Gaius, then she shouldn\u2019t have joined his demented band of misfits.</p><p>Even if she had been abandoned\u2014no, nearly killed\u2014by her mother and left on her own to figure out the shocking changes going through her body?</p><p>He gave a disgruntled wave of his hand. He couldn\u2019t trust his thinking. Not when he was under the influence of her spell.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll finish this conversation once we\u2019ve returned to Styx\u2019s lair.\u201d</p><p>She backed away, shaking her head even as she dug her fingernails into the sleeve of her sweatshirt, scratching at her inner arm. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t press me, little witch.\u201d His brows snapped together as his frustrated glare shifted to where she rubbed at her arm. It was distracting. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy arm itches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in an angry breath. \u201cProbably because I\u2019m allergic to ill-mannered jerks who get their jollies from intimidating helpless women,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that or you gave me cooties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He leaned forward, his blood heating as the enticing scent of peaches teased at his senses. Damn witch. \u201cYou want to see the last of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take off this goddamn spell.\u201d</p><p>She actually pretended to be puzzled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood, Sally.\u201d He grabbed her by the shoulders, his grasp tight, but oddly careful not to bruise. \u201cTake it off or I promise you that you\u2019ll be very, very sorry.\u201d</p><p>She futilely tried to pull away. \u201cThe spell was broken the moment I passed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a temporary enchantment,\u201d she protested. \u201cIt was fading when we reached the end of the tunnel. By the time I fell asleep it was completely gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014you\u2019re lying. You\u2019re trying to use me in some nefarious plot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNefarious?\u201d she muttered. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He lifted her off her feet, glaring straight into her wide eyes. \u201cYou bitch . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cChill,\u201d she rasped, her dark eyes flashing with irritation. \u201cAnd watch what you call me.\u201d</p><p>Such stubborn courage.</p><p>Such exquisite beauty.</p><p>With a growl, he abruptly dropped her back to her feet, taking a step away from her sweet temptation. \u201cWhat I call you should be the least of your concern.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled before regaining her balance, tossing back her brilliant autumn hair as she glared at him in frustration. \u201cWhat do you want from me? My promise? No freaking problem.\u201d She drew an X on her sweatshirt, directly over her heart. He clenched his hands as the gesture emphasized the soft curve of her breasts. \u201cI cross my heart and hope to die that the spell is gone.\u201d Her hand dropped. \u201cIf it was still active don\u2019t you think I would be making you lead me away from here, not freezing my ass off in this nasty . . .\u201d She glanced around the warehouse where he\u2019d brought her before the sun rose hours ago. \u201cWhere are we anyway?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, grimly allowing the humiliating memories of fleeing through the tunnels to escape with this female to rise to his mind.</p><p>At the time he would have done anything to keep her safe.</p><p>Anything.</p><p>And then he\u2019d climbed out of the tunnel and the driving compulsion had been gone. Just as if a spell had suddenly been broken.</p><p>He shook his head. No. This had to be a trick.</p><p>What could be more clever than to release him from the greater compulsion so he would presume the spell was gone, while all along keeping him tied to her by far more subtle means?</p><p>A Manchurian candidate ready to be triggered when she felt the urge.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>She shivered as his power wrapped around her in icy warning. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, why are you so convinced I\u2019m lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can still feel you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Her words trailed away, her already pale face becoming downright ashen.</p><p>The sight wasn\u2019t reassuring. \u201cNo smart-ass denial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe spell is gone.\u201d She hunched her shoulders, rubbing at her arm. \u201cIt has to be a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a lingering side effect,\u201d she said. \u201cYeah. A lingering side effect. That has to be it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe her excuse.</p><p>He knew because he could actually feel her growing agitation.</p><p>As if it were his own.</p><p>\u201cSally.\u201d</p><p>She scrambled back as he reached to grasp her shoulders, her breath coming in short, painful pants.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know, okay? I told you I haven\u2019t had much practice at being a demon.\u201d She gave a sudden cry, yanking up the sleeve of her sweatshirt. \u201cDammit. Why is my arm itching?\u201d There was a startled silence before Sally released a strangled moan. \u201cOh . . . shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d he growled, wondering if she was trying to distract him.</p><p>\u201cI think I have a disease.\u201d</p><p>She turned her arm to reveal the intricate red scrolling that crawled the length of her inner forearm. The marking wasn\u2019t a disease. Or a reaction to his cooties. Or even the result of a drunken trip to the local tattoo parlor.</p><p>This mark was beneath the pale skin and only one thing could cause it.</p><p>A mating.</p><p>Swearing in several languages, Roke ripped off his leather jacket to glare down at the matching tattoo that marred his own arm.</p><p>The demon in him howled in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cGod . . . dammit.\u201d</p><p>Sally glanced at him in confusion. \u201cAm I dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if I decide to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d She tried to meet him glare for glare but she couldn\u2019t hide her growing fear.</p><p>And for some stupid reason that pissed him off more than the mark of bonding on his arm.</p><p>\u201cNothing about this FUBAR situation is funny,\u201d he roared, moving with lightning speed to slam his hand into the brick wall.</p><p>His knuckles split open beneath the impact and the bricks crumbled to dust. Ignoring the blood dripping onto the cement floor, he slammed his hand into the bricks again, allowing the pain to hold back the blinding fury that threatened to consume him.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Sally cried from behind him. \u201cYou might be immortal, but I\u2019m not so sure I am.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Belatedly realizing his temper tantrum was sending a shower of dust and plaster from the ceiling, Roke turned to glare at his companion. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>She jerkily brushed the dust from her hair. \u201cI haven\u2019t done . . .\u201d She seemed to forget what she was going to say as her gaze shifted over his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He turned back, startled to discover the large hole he\u2019d punched into the wall had revealed the top of an old-fashioned steel strongbox complete with a combination lock.</p> <p>\u201cA safe of some sort,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>What did he care? He\u2019d discovered this forgotten warehouse during his first week in Chicago. It was not only isolated from most humans, but it was far enough from Styx\u2019s lair that he could enjoy his nightly meditation without fear of interruption.</p><p>He\u2019d never given much thought to who had owned it before it was abandoned.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something strange about it.\u201d She moved to stand at his side, her brow furrowed. \u201cI think we should open it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have much bigger things to worry about than some forgotten treasure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in treasure,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with the aura around it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAura?\u201d With a roll of his eyes, Roke reached to rip the top off the safe, ignoring the ear-splitting screech of metal as it was wrenched apart. The sooner he was done with Sally\u2019s latest attempt to distract him, the sooner they could deal with the catastrophe she\u2019d created. Peering into the safe, he made a sound of impatience. \u201cIt\u2019s empty. Are you happy . . . ?\u201d He frowned, blinking as there was a strange shimmer, like the sheen of a soap bubble before it burst to reveal something at the very bottom. \u201cNo, wait. There\u2019s a book.\u201d</p><p>Reaching into the safe, Roke was caught off guard when Sally grabbed his arm in a frantic grip.</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t touch it.\u201d</p><p>He sent her a wary glance. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a spell wrapped around it.\u201d She shivered. \u201cA very nasty spell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you get rid of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without time to prepare a counterspell.\u201d She turned to meet his narrowed stare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019re certain I must be lying.\u201d She folded her arms over her chest, her expression militant. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me, go ahead and touch it.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. As if magic hadn\u2019t screwed up his life enough. He wasn\u2019t about to be turned into a newt. Or worse.</p><p>Of course. If he was a newt, then he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether or not he\u2019d been trapped with this female for the next eternity.</p><p>With a shake of his head, Roke returned to pull on his leather jacket before grabbing Sally around the waist and, with one smooth motion, tossing her over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThis night could truly not get any worse,\u201d he muttered, heading toward the door.</p> <p>\u201cHey, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she protested, slamming her hands against his back.</p><p>His arms wrapped around her thighs, keeping her from kicking him.</p><p>\u201cIf you hope to survive the night, little witch, you\u2019ll keep your mouth shut until I tell you to speak.\u201d</p><p>There was another flurry of fists to his back, hard enough to crack a rib.</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>The woods of Wisconsin</p><p>Gaius stood hidden in the trees that circled the honky-tonk joint. The wooden structure with a brick chimney that belched smoke toward the star-speckled sky was barely adequate to contain the large crowd of humans that gyrated to the blaring country music. Not that they seemed to notice as they chugged their beer and laughed with increasing frequency.</p><p>They were young and arrogant and confident that they were impervious to harm.</p><p>Fools.</p><p>Not one of them sensed that death hovered just out of sight.</p><p>Gaius\u2019s fangs lengthened, the scent of fresh blood overcoming even the stench of brats and sauerkraut. His stomach rumbled. Tasty.</p><p>Somewhere in the back of his mind he knew he shouldn\u2019t be hungry. Hadn\u2019t he fed the night before last? Or was it last night?</p><p>Time was starting to run together. Something that should have troubled him. Just as his filthy, tangled hair and bloodstained clothing should have troubled him.</p><p>Ah well.</p><p>With a shake of his head, he moved forward, wincing as the shouts of drunken revelry turned to shrieks of terror.</p><p>His pace remained steady. They wouldn\u2019t run. They never ran. At least not anymore.</p><p>It was a shame, really.</p><p>What was the point of being a predator if you couldn\u2019t chase your prey?</p><p>Of course, if he were to be completely honest, he wasn\u2019t certain that he had the energy to play the role of hunter. Since Dara\u2019s return he hadn\u2019t been able to rest. Not just because he had to be on guard to protect her, but fulfilling her constant needs was draining.</p><p>Perhaps that explained his incessant hunger. . . .</p><p>Climbing the wooden steps, Gaius entered the building and paused to savor the overwhelming emotions that filled the air. In the far corner the twenty humans cowered together in frozen terror, some crying softly while others gave panicked little moans. None, however, made a move to attack him.</p><p>Passing by the long, waist-high bar, he reached over to grab the bartender, who had been trying to ram his three-hundred-pound body beneath a shelf. With a strength that revealed his was anything but human, he hauled the struggling man over the bar and with one smooth strike had his teeth buried in the thick neck.</p><p>The man screamed, struggling to pull a large knife from its sheath at his waist. Gaius easily knocked the weapon from his hand as he sucked the blood from the bartender\u2019s body, his burning hunger barely assuaged.</p><p>Dropping the corpse, he turned his attention toward the huddled mass, pointing his finger toward a slender, dark-haired female.</p><p>A tender bud of female temptation.</p><p>With a crook of his finger he had her on her feet and walking toward him. Her eyes were blank of emotion beneath his compulsion, but she readily went to her knees and reached for his belt buckle.</p><p>Dara wouldn\u2019t mind. She was too ill to satisfy his needs.</p><p>And as long as he remembered to take four or five of the shivering mortals back to satisfy her strange cravings, she would be happy enough.</p><p>The female wrapped her lips around his aching cock and Gaius allowed the nagging sense of . . . wrongness . . . to melt away.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>The Ozark Mountains</p><p>Nefri perched on the edge of the bed with Santiago seated directly behind her, his legs bracketing hers as he ran a brush through the thick strands of her damp hair.</p><p>It was the sort of casually intimate moment that most lovers shared.</p><p>Except for her.</p><p>She never indulged in love play. It made her feel exposed. Even more exposed than the actual act of sex. After all, sex was a primitive need that could be shared between complete strangers.</p><p>This . . . this was true intimacy. It took a level of faith she was never comfortable offering.</p><p>Until tonight.</p><p>After hours of pleasure, she\u2019d fallen asleep wrapped in Santiago\u2019s arms, only to awaken to his wicked kisses stirring the hunger she had thought sated for the next century.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she could sense the sun setting that they\u2019d at last made it to the long overdue shower.</p><p>Now they were forced to wait for Baine to either reveal his secrets or tell them to go.</p><p>Something that should be making Santiago nuts. He wasn\u2019t a patient sort of vampire (understatement of the century). He should be snorting and fuming and threatening to castrate Baine for forcing him to sit around and wait for the dragon\u2019s decision.</p><p>Instead he calmly ran the brush through her hair, his prolonged silence as uncharacteristic as his lack of irritation.</p><p>\u201cYou seem . . .\u201d She searched for a word that wouldn\u2019t rub against his pride. Men were so sensitive. \u201cPensive.\u201d</p><p>She felt him shrug. \u201cI\u2019m a pensive kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound of disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019re the least pensive man I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve been insulted or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I like your ability to listen to your instincts.\u201d She shifted so she could study his guarded expression. He was dressed in a gray sweatshirt and jeans that had magically appeared in the armoire along with jeans and a lovely peach cashmere sweater for her. His hair had already been brushed and braided, emphasizing the sharp angles and planes of his achingly handsome face. \u201cAnd your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, hmmm?\u201d He smiled with decadent promise, the tips of his fangs visible. \u201cHow much do you like me?\u201d</p><p>A shiver inched down her spine. Her instant reaction was downright indecent.</p><p>\u201cWell enough.\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes smoldered with a rising heat. \u201cI think I can make you like me better than well enough.\u201d His head dipped downward, nuzzling at the sensitive spot at the base of her throat.</p><p>Her hands lifted to press at his shoulders. She had to stop him now or she\u2019d be lost. \u201cSantiago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking about?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The tip of one fang scraped down the line of her collarbone. \u201cYou want to discuss it now?\u201d</p><p>Of course she didn\u2019t.

But if she allowed herself to be distracted, she knew she\u2019d never discover what was troubling him. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He reluctantly pulled back, regarding her with a brooding gaze. \u201cWhy did you leave last time without even saying good-bye?\u201d</p> <p>Nefri froze. Oh . . . lord. That wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d been expecting. If she had, she certainly wouldn\u2019t have pressed him.</p><p>Now she turned to stare blindly at the hand-carved dressing table that had been a gift from a grateful Persian king. Or at least the illusion of her table. Anything to avoid his unwavering gaze.</p><p>\u201cBecause I was afraid if I saw you again I wouldn\u2019t have the courage to leave,\u201d she said, her voice so low only a vampire could have picked up her words.</p><p>\u201cAnd that would have been a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy people needed their clan chief.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what about what I needed, cara?\u201d</p><p>She clenched her hands. Okay, she hadn\u2019t told him the full truth.</p><p>A part of her had fled because it was safer to scurry back behind the Veil and forget about the vampire that made her feel as vulnerable as a foundling.</p><p>But, she truly had needed to return to her people.</p><p>They\u2019d been deeply disturbed to realize that Gaius was a traitor who had taken advantage of their secluded clan to acquire the skills to assist the Dark Lord in ripping apart the barriers between worlds.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. Did he expect her to turn her back on her people? To walk away from her responsibilities?</p><p>The mere thought should have been infuriating, but she found herself actually considering the possibility.</p><p>Could she leave her people to return to this world? Could she give up her leadership to be with the man who had reminded her that there was more to life than just duty?</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what she was going to say, and in the end it didn\u2019t matter as the bedroom abruptly melted around them.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Leaping to his feet, Santiago caught her as the bed disappeared.</p><p>The air around them shimmered, before becoming a long hallway with a set of double doors at the far end.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems that Baine has reached his decision,\u201d she said.</p><p>Santiago grasped her by the shoulders, turning her to meet his resolute expression. \u201cThis conversation is postponed, not finished.\u201d</p><p>She resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Like she doubted for a second the stubborn vampire would press until he had the answer he wanted?</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She gently pulled out of his grasp. \u201cBut later. We shouldn\u2019t keep Baine waiting.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced, but he fell into step beside her, his hand automatically reaching to unsheathe the sword that he\u2019d strapped to his back.</p><p>Nefri held her tongue until they reached the end of the paneled hall. Then, laying her hand on his arm, she halted him from opening the door. \u201cSantiago.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her with a lifted brow. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to keep the dragon waiting?\u201d</p><p>She chose her words with care. \u201cBaine might be one of the oldest, most powerful creatures in several universes, but in some ways he can be almost childish. If you offend him he might very well refuse to share what he knows.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched at her careful diplomacy. \u201cI promise to be on my very bestest behavior. Is that what you want to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would let me deal with the dragon.\u201d She met his deliberately blank expression. \u201cJust . . .\u201d She bit off her words and gave a resigned shake of her head. The vampire would do exactly what he wanted to do. \u201cOh, never mind,\u201d she muttered, reaching to shove the door open. \u201cSo stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStones in glass houses, Nefri,\u201d he whispered into her ear as she stepped past him.</p><p>Ignoring his taunt, Nefri entered the throne room, not surprised to find the dragon indolently sprawled on the large throne. He was again dressed in nothing more than a loose pair of dojo pants, his shimmering tattoos crawling over his skin and his eyes burning with an amber fire.</p><p>\u201cBaine.\u201d She came to a halt and performed a respectful bow. \u201cThank you for speaking with us again.\u201d</p><p>The amber gaze shifted to Santiago, who stood protectively at her side, his sword in hand.</p><p>\u201cI would prefer not to; I certainly have more intriguing matters to claim my attention,\u201d he murmured, his attention turning back to Nefri. \u201cUnfortunately, I have a debt to pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA debt?\u201d Santiago asked.</p><p>Baine shrugged. \u201cA beautiful vampire once saved my life. I will attempt to return the favor.\u201d</p><p>Nefri shook her head as Santiago slid a questioning glance in her direction. She\u2019d never heard rumors of a vampire rescuing a dragon, although she didn\u2019t doubt it would prove to be a fascinating story.</p><p>For now, however, she was far more interested in Baine\u2019s implication that the vampires needed to be saved.</p><p>\u201cAre we in that much danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Nefri shivered at the blunt agreement. \u201cFrom the spirit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than just a spirit. It\u2019s a\u2014\u201d Baine halted, seeming to consider his words. \u201cA creator.\u201d</p><p>Beside her, Santiago stiffened. \u201cA god?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends on your definition of god.\u201d Baine absently touched a tattoo that resembled an ancient Sanskrit mark that briefly appeared on his neck. Nefri suspected that Baine had been considered a god by more than one cult over the centuries. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer worshipped, or even remembered by most, but it did spawn several species of demons.\u201d</p><p>Nefri\u2019s growing concern only intensified. It hadn\u2019t occurred to her that the spirit had family in the world.</p><p>\u201cDemons that still exist?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Baine assured her. \u201cYou\u2019re familiar with Lamsung demons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoul-suckers,\u201d Santiago said in disgust.</p><p>The Lamsung had been forced into a hell dimension centuries before. Few demons were willing to risk their souls to a creature that could drain them for dinner. It was claimed that the Sylvermysts possessed rare swords that were made with the heart of a Lamsung demon and capable of giving them strength through the enemies they slayed.</p><p>\u201cDescriptive,\u201d Baine mocked.</p><p>Nefri ignored Santiago\u2019s prickle of power that crawled over her skin. She didn\u2019t have time for a male pissing match.</p><p>\u201cIs that what this spirit does?\u201d she demanded. \u201cSteal the souls of his victims?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Baine shook his head. \u201cThe feeding of souls is unique to the Lamsung, just as the spirit\u2019s other children have their own special dietary habits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other children?\u201d Santiago growled.</p><p>Baine smiled. \u201cCan\u2019t you guess?\u201d</p><p>The truth hit Nefri with blinding force. What other creature lived off the life force of their victims?</p><p>\u201cVampires?\u201d</p><p>The dragon\u2019s smile widened. \u201cVampires.\u201d</p><p>Santiago wasn\u2019t a philosophical vampire.</p><p>Oh, he was intelligent and well read, and a cunning warrior. But he\u2019d never understood the need to brood and ponder on matters that had no straightforward answer.</p><p>He preferred action to reaction.</p><p>This, however, was enough to make any man hesitate.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying this . . . thing is the creator of vampires?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Baine gave a wave of his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s my assumption.\u201d</p><p>Santiago\u2019s low growl rumbled in his throat. This dragon would be greatly improved by a good ass-kicking. A damned shame he\u2019d promised Nefri to be on his best behavior.</p><p>\u201cAssumption?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cSantiago.\u201d Nefri sent him one of those glances that held a combination of exasperation and warning before turning back to the dragon. \u201cAs you can imagine, this has been a shock.\u201d</p><p>Baine lifted a brow. \u201cDon\u2019t you know anything of your history?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s very little written on the origins of vampires. And the oral history . . .\u201d Nefri gave a lift of her hands. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have to tell you, we\u2019re an arrogant species. It\u2019s not surprising that most believe we were sent to this world by superior beings to become the ultimate rulers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it never occurred to you that you might be a mutation from a more primitive demon?\u201d Baine demanded.</p><p>Nefri shook her head. \u201cMy studies have been slanted toward the mystical rather than the scientific. I\u2019ve never researched evolution.\u201d</p><p>The burning amber gaze shifted to Santiago. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI like the \u2018ultimate rulers\u2019 theory.\u201d</p><p>Baine snorted, a hint of smoke curling from one nostril. \u201cPredictable.\u201d</p><p>Nefri ignored their little interchange, her expression hinting that she wasn\u2019t nearly so calm as she was trying to pretend.</p><p>\u201cWill you share what you know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy knowledge is fragmented and far too much relies on stories I\u2019ve heard secondhand,\u201d the dragon admitted. \u201cI never encountered the actual spirit in person. Thank my own very mysterious gods.\u201d</p><p>Santiago instinctively tightened his hand on his sword. Knowing that the all-powerful dragon was afraid of the spirit wasn\u2019t particularly heartening. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s claimed that the spirit is capable of feeding off any demon, no matter how strong they might be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt feeds off demons?\u201d Santiago rasped.</p><p>\u201cDemons or humans.\u201d Baine shrugged. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be particular.\u201d</p><p>Well, this just got better and better.</p><p>Grimacing, Santiago tried to shove aside the growing list of reasons why he should return to Styx and tell him to appoint another vampire to hunt down Gaius.</p><p>The spirit was an enemy. He needed to approach it as he would any other enemy. Which meant gaining as much intel as he could.</p> <p>\u201cYou said that its spawn had their own means of feeding,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich I assume means it doesn\u2019t drink blood or suck souls.\u201d</p><p>Baine smiled, the amber eyes smoldering with fire. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the . . .\u201d Santiago stilled, cursing himself for being so dense. It all made perfect, horrible sense now. \u201cMierda.\u201d</p><p>Nefri sent him a puzzled glance. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmotion,\u201d he rasped. \u201cIt feeds off emotion.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, easily able to make the same connection that he had. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, not all brawn,\u201d Baine drawled.</p><p>Santiago narrowed his gaze. \u201cI have my moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this creature feeds off emotion, it makes sense that it would inspire fear and lust and violence among humans,\u201d Nefri murmured, speaking her thoughts out loud.</p><p>\u201cAnd demons,\u201d Baine reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes, and demons.\u201d Her brow furrowed. \u201cBut why use Gaius to spread the emotions? Does it need a conduit?\u201d</p><p>Baine tapped a finger on the arm of his throne. \u201cAre you certain it\u2019s Gaius that\u2019s creating the emotions?\u201d</p><p>Nefri gave a hesitant nod. \u201cAs certain as we can be at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis spirit,\u201d Santiago abruptly interrupted, \u201cis it able to take corporeal form?\u201d</p> <p>Baine shook his head. \u201cLike vampires it\u2019s symbiant.\u201d</p><p>Santiago scowled. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must take possession of a body that belongs to another.\u201d</p><p>Santiago glanced toward Nefri. They\u2019d been chasing what they thought were two demons. Was it possible that it was just one and he was being possessed by the spirit?</p><p>\u201cGaius?\u201d</p><p>She chewed her bottom lip. \u201cYou said that the witch claimed he was protecting someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never did see the \u2018someone,\u2019\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she agreed, although her expression remained troubled.</p><p>Santiago didn\u2019t blame her. Right now they could do no more than make wild suppositions that didn\u2019t do them a damned bit of good.</p><p>He turned back to the dragon. \u201cThe most important question is how do we kill it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s what you want?\u201d The amber flames in Baine\u2019s eyes became oddly hypnotizing. \u201cIt is, after all, your ultimate sire.\u201d</p><p>Santiago shook off the dragon\u2019s intrusion into his mind. The bastard was no doubt hoping to enjoy a full-blown spiritual crisis. Unfortunately for him, Santiago was a warrior, not a monk.</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen if it\u2019s left free?\u201d</p><p>A mocking smile touched Baine\u2019s mouth. \u201cStrong emotions have inevitable conclusions. It begins with murder and rape and the always favorite pillaging. Eventually it will disintegrate into war, genocide, and famine.\u201d</p><p>He felt Nefri grow rigid at the stark warning and he instinctively rubbed a comforting hand down her back.</p><p>Not that he had much comfort to offer.</p><p>Dammit, hadn\u2019t they just prevented the end of the world? Now they had to face war and genocide and famine?</p><p>Where was the justice in that?</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer the question,\u201d he reminded the dragon, in no mood to be diplomatic. He snorted. Who was he kidding? He was never in the mood to be diplomatic. But after the past few weeks he was even more impatient than usual. \u201cHow do we kill it?\u201d</p><p>Baine\u2019s tattoos swirled in warning, although his voice remained soft. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>So the mighty dragon knew everything but the information they most needed.</p><p>Predictable.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Baine leaned forward. \u201cBut I do find it intriguing that the Commission chose to imprison the spirit rather than destroying it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Santiago paused. He\u2019d rather have his tongue cut out than admit it, but the oversized lizard had a point.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t the Oracles killed the creature? Because they were demon conservationists who didn\u2019t believe in killing off the potential last of a species? Yeah, right. More likely it was because they didn\u2019t know how to get rid of the thing.</p><p>So instead they sent Nefri to do their dirty work, not giving a shit that she might die in the process.</p><p>Fury raced through him at the same time Baine rose from his throne, his surge of power making the earth shake beneath their feet.</p><p>Instinctively, Santiago shoved Nefri behind him, his sword raised. \u201cDo we have a problem, dragon?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cYour companion is searching for you,\u201d Baine growled, his tattoos darkening. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not alone.\u201d</p><p>Santiago frowned. \u201cWhat companion?\u201d</p><p>Nefri elbowed him in the side. \u201cLevet.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. He wouldn\u2019t call the miniature pest a companion. More like an unwelcome boil on his ass.</p><p>\u201cOur\u201d\u2014his lips twisted as he forced out the word\u2014\u201ccompanion can wait. I still have questions.\u201d</p><p>Baine shook his head. \u201cI have paid my debt.\u201d He shifted his attention to the silent Nefri, the amber flames consuming his eyes. \u201cMy last word of warning, beautiful Nefri, is not to hesitate. With every passing day the spirit grows more powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait . . .\u201d Santiago stepped forward, but even as he moved, the throne room was dissolving around him.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>He held on to Nefri as Baine offered a last mocking wave and the throne room faded to be replaced by the rolling meadow and large tree that was no longer split in two.</p><p>Barely managing to keep his balance at the abrupt change from a polished wood floor to muddy, uneven ground, Santiago\u2019s seething frustration became pure male outrage at the stench of granite and . . . was that brimstone?</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d a French-accented voice proclaimed. \u201cMon dieu. I thought you\u2019d been stolen by leprechauns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeprechauns,\u201d a female voice taunted. \u201cEveryone knows there are no leprechauns.\u201d</p><p>Spinning on his heel, Santiago discovered the stunted gargoyle standing a few feet away, accompanied by a tiny female demon with black, oblong-shaped eyes and razor sharp teeth.</p><p>Gods almighty, the gargoyle had a friend?</p><p>Okay, maybe not a friend, he hastily revised his opinion as the two glared at one another.</p><p>\u201cIt was a metaphor,\u201d Levet informed his companion, his wings quivering with anger.</p><p>The female gave a toss of her long braid, her hands smoothing down the long, white robe that covered her diminutive body. \u201cIt was idiotic,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cDios.\u201d Santiago turned to discover Nefri regarding the tiny couple with a faint smile. \u201cShoot me now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Styx\u2019s lair in Chicago</p><p>Sally didn\u2019t know why she was caught off guard when Roke carried her directly to Styx\u2019s dungeon.</p><p>Did she think making him her temporary love-slave would soften his hatred for her? Or hey, maybe he would be grateful she\u2019d made him betray his people and help her escape?</p><p>Yeah, he should be thrilled-to-freaking-death with her.</p><p>Still, as he entered the house by the hidden tunnel and headed directly to the dungeon, she was overwhelmed by a sudden avalanche of panic.</p><p>What did he intend to do to her? He\u2019d been furious in the warehouse. How did she know he didn\u2019t intend to kill her and leave her body for the scavengers?</p><p>And once she was back in the hexed cell, she would be utterly helpless.</p><p>Pounding his back with her fists, she futilely attempted to kick him in the one place vampires were as vulnerable as any other man.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she shrieked. \u201cI won\u2019t be locked up again.\u201d</p><p>His steps never faltered as he bypassed the curious guards. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for your opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d He ignored her, shoving open the door to the dungeon and heading down the narrow corridor that ran between the line of cells. \u201cRoke, did you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your screechings are audible to half of Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Sally bit her lip. Her hands ached from hitting the unyielding muscles of his back and with every step the cell grew nearer. Soon she would be locked away. Or worse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Abruptly something inside her broke and to her utter humiliation she burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . bastard.\u201d</p><p>Apparently as shocked as she was by her emotional meltdown, Roke slid her off his shoulder so she was standing directly in front of him.</p><p>\u201cSssh,\u201d he muttered, frowning as his thumbs brushed the tears from her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>She sniffed, telling herself that she wasn\u2019t comforted by his gentle touch.</p><p>He was a . . . a . . . cold-blooded leech.</p><p>\u201cYou already have,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He appeared ridiculously outraged by her accusation. \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d</p><p>Was he serious? She lifted her arm to reveal the strange rash on her inner arm.</p> <p>\u201cThis, for one thing.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened, as if angered by her reminder of the crimson mark. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me. That\u2019s entirely your fault.\u201d He lifted his own arm, pushing back the sleeve of his jacket to reveal a matching rash.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t . . .\u201d Her words faltered. Wait. How could he have the same exact rash as her? Was it some side effect from her powers? She hadn\u2019t heard of anything like it. All right, there was the brand between mated vampires that was supposed to be some sort of red tattoo, but it couldn\u2019t be that. Impossible. Abruptly she remembered his fury as he\u2019d ripped off his jacket and her heart stuttered to a painful halt. \u201cOh crap. Is that . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mating mark,\u201d he assured her in icy tones.</p><p>She shook her head, stumbling backward as her brain refused to accept what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that possible? I thought leeches had to exchange blood to become bonded.\u201d She unconsciously ran her fingers over the markings on her arm, as if she could rub them away. \u201cNot to mention lack the homicidal urge to murder each other.\u201d</p> <p>He curled back his lips to reveal his fully extended fangs. Yep. Definitely murder on his mind.</p><p>\u201cObviously your spell triggered the mating instinct.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. Mating instinct. It was primitive. Uncivilized.</p><p>And not at all a reason for her stomach to flutter as if she were . . .</p><p>Excited?</p><p>No. Way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how it happened,\u201d she said, an edge of panic in her voice. \u201cJust get rid of it.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a dark brow, his pale eyes reflecting the overhead light. \u201cAnd how would you suggest I do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She licked her dry lips.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around her body, which continued to shake with uncontrollable tremors. \u201cHow do vampires break the bond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d He held her wary gaze, his expression grim. \u201cA mating is for eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this isn\u2019t a real mating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. Was this some sort of trick? Did he think she\u2019d intentionally tried to trap them together? \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t feel me deep inside you?\u201d His voice thickened, his fingers lightly touching the narrow valley between her breasts. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>An erotic burst of heat speared through her at his touch. A heat that was nearly as shocking as the realization he was right.</p><p>She could feel him.</p><p>His burning frustration. His barely leashed fury.</p><p>His unwanted arousal.</p><p>She\u2019d tried to tell herself that the sensations were just an echo of the spell that had bound them together.</p><p>That it would quickly fade.</p><p>But the words rang hollow.</p><p>He was . . . a part of her.</p><p>\u201cRoke,\u201d she breathed, her heart skipping a beat as he turned smoothly toward the far door.</p><p>\u201cStyx is coming.\u201d</p><p>His muttered words had barely left his lips when the door to the dungeon was flung open with enough force to make the hinges squeak in protest.</p><p>A bare second later the six-foot-five Aztec warrior entered the dungeons, bringing with him an icy tidal wave of power.</p><p>As far as entrances went, this one was a doozy, and Sally instinctively stepped backward, pressing herself against Roke, as if he were a safe harbor in the midst of a gathering hurricane.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d the Anasso roared, the lights flickering in and out to create an unnerving strobe effect.</p><p>\u201cSally, look at me,\u201d Roke commanded in a low voice, grasping her chin to force her to meet his shimmering gaze.</p><p>She struggled to breath, suddenly so cold her teeth were chattering. \u201cI\u2019ll take a wild stab and say he\u2019s pissed,\u201d she managed to mutter.</p><p>He leaned down until their noses were nearly touching, an oddly possessive expression tightening his lean features. \u201cNot nearly as pissed as I\u2019m going to be if you try to use your powers on him,\u201d he rasped. \u201cIn fact, you can consider that particular skill off-line for the foreseeable future.\u201d</p><p>Her fear remained. Full-scale. She was trapped between two angry vampires. There wasn\u2019t a witch alive who wouldn\u2019t be frightened out of her mind.</p><p>But she was female enough to be annoyed by his blatant command. \u201cYou\u2019re not the boss of me.\u201d</p><p>His thumb brushed her lower lip, his gaze searing a path over her stubborn expression. \u201cDon\u2019t push this, witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She became lost in the compelling beauty of his eyes, her annoyance floundering as she felt his fierce tension. This wasn\u2019t just a male need to toss out orders. It . . . mattered to him. \u201cTrust me, I never intend to use it again,\u201d she at last conceded.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he growled. \u201cBecause if you try to bond with another man, I\u2019ll . . .\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cYou\u2019ll what?\u201d</p><p>Without warning he grabbed her face and kissed her with a raw yearning that she felt to the tips of her toes.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me nuts,\u201d he muttered against her lips.</p><p>She clutched at his leather jacket, her knees stupidly weak. \u201cThe feeling is entirely mutual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoke,\u201d a dark, frigid voice broke into their brief moment of madness. \u201cAm I intruding?\u201d</p><p>Releasing his hold on her, Roke turned to face his king, angling his body so she was half shielded behind him.</p><p>Sally blinked in surprise. He couldn\u2019t feel a need to protect her. Could he?</p><p>\u201cI thought you went to speak with the Oracles?\u201d Roke said to the towering vampire who was regarding him with a narrowed glare.</p><p>\u201cThey refused to see me.\u201d He folded his arms over his massive chest, testing the limits of endurance for the black T-shirt that was matched with a pair of black leather pants and heavy boots. \u201cWhich meant I wasn\u2019t in the mood to return to my lair and discover I\u2019ve been harboring a traitor.\u201d</p><p>Sally went rigid at the accusation. \u201cHe\u2019s not a traitor,\u201d she blurted out before she could halt the words.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d The King of Vampires turned his alarming attention in her direction. \u201cMy guards informed me that Roke took you from this cell against my strict orders, and then with the excuse he was taking you to meet with me, he assisted in your escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because I forced him.\u201d</p><p>Styx stepped forward, emphasizing her distinct lack of stature. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her chin tilted even as her brain screamed to shut her mouth. Unfortunately, the two weren\u2019t currently connected. \u201cI\u2019m not completely helpless. And, as you see, he brought me back.\u201d</p><p>Styx studied her for a long, nerve-wracking minute. \u201cSuch a fierce defense of your captor,\u201d he at last murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not defending him.\u201d She hunched a shoulder, well aware she sounded like an idiot. Crap. Could she blame it on the mating? Obviously it was destroying what few brain cells she had left. \u201cI\u2019m just . . . explaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStyx.\u201d With a fluid movement, Roke was shifting to stand at Styx\u2019s side, as if he were trying to distract the large vampire from Sally. \u201cI need to speak with you in private.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, pretending she didn\u2019t notice her treacherous flare of warmth at Roke\u2019s protective gesture. Instead she sent him a warning scowl.</p><p>She\u2019d be damned if she\u2019d be abandoned alone in this dungeon.</p><p>Not again.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re not leaving me here.\u201d</p><p>Styx started to offer a condescending smile at her sharp words only to freeze as his gaze caught sight of the markings on her inner arm. \u201cChrist,\u201d he rasped. \u201cRoke, what have you done?\u201d</p><p>The Anasso reached to grab her arm, but without warning Roke was slamming into the larger vampire, pinning him to the bars of the nearest cell.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her,\u201d he growled.</p><p>A deathly silence filled the dungeon. A silence even more shocking after the unexpected flurry of violence.</p><p>Sally didn\u2019t dare breathe as the two powerful demons glared at one another. Then, curling back his lips to display his enormous fangs, Styx spoke in low, commanding tones.</p><p>\u201cRelease me, brother.\u201d Enough power filled the air to send Roke stumbling backward. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>Roke rammed his fingers through his hair, his jaw clenched so tight it was a wonder his teeth didn\u2019t crack under the strain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDammit,\u201d Roke hissed.</p><p>Styx straightened, his warrior features carved from granite. \u201cYou\u2019re right, we do need to speak.\u201d</p><p>Sally sucked in an unsteady breath as the two men turned, clearly preparing to leave the dungeons without her.</p> <p>\u201cRoke, if you abandon me here I swear I won\u2019t help with the book.\u201d</p><p>Styx halted, sending her a puzzled frown. \u201cWhat book?\u201d \u201cSally,\u201d Roke growled.</p><p>She slammed her hands onto her hips. It was no doubt suicidal to challenge two of the most powerful vampires she\u2019d ever met, but the mere thought of being locked away overcame any claim to sanity.</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>The dark band around the pale, pale eyes narrowed, a sure sign of annoyance. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the only witch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe not, but you\u2019ll never find another who has my power, or my familiarity with black magic,\u201d she reminded him. It wasn\u2019t bragging. The gods knew she hated her connection to black magic. It was the simple truth. \u201cYou need me.\u201d</p><p>For a second they glared at one another in silence, then realizing he was going to eventually need her help, he conceded defeat with all his usual grace.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he growled, turning to stomp his way toward the dungeon door. \u201cShe\u2019s coming with us.\u201d</p><p>Peaches.</p><p>Roke clenched his teeth as they entered Styx\u2019s private study and the large vampire shut the door behind them.</p><p>He was furious with the female. Hell, furious didn\u2019t even cover it. She\u2019d bespelled him, forced him to act against his will, mated him, and now blackmailed him to get out of the dungeons. But, that didn\u2019t keep him from placing a possessive hand on her shoulder as Styx moved past them to lean against a heavy desk that held a computer and several monitors.</p> <p>And it didn\u2019t halt that maddening scent of peaches from making his fangs ache with a desire to sink them deep into her flesh and taste if her blood were as sweet as that tantalizing perfume.</p><p>Folding his arms over his chest, Styx studied Roke\u2019s tense expression before turning his attention to Sally.</p><p>\u201cI should warn you, Ms. Grace, that this room has been hexed,\u201d he said, his low voice edged with warning. \u201cYour magic won\u2019t work here.\u201d</p><p>Roke snorted. \u201cActually, you shouldn\u2019t be so certain, old friend.\u201d His gaze slid to the tiny witch at his side. \u201cMs. Grace is full of surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose she is,\u201d the Anasso murmured. \u201cAre you going to tell me how you two ended up mated?\u201d</p><p>Roke watched in fascination as a blush crept beneath Sally\u2019s pale face and for the first time he considered the fact that despite her sharp tongue and foolish courage, she was extremely young.</p><p>Why did the thought make him feel like a letch? None of this catastrophe was his fault.</p><p>\u201cDo you want the honors?\u201d he growled.</p> <p>Her blush deepened as she warily met Styx\u2019s unwavering gaze. \u201cI\u2019m part demon.\u201d</p><p>The ancient vampire hissed, obviously caught off guard by her confession. \u201cWhat demon?\u201d</p><p>Roke\u2019s lips twisted into a humorless smile. Welcome to my world, bud.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She held up a silencing hand as Styx\u2019s lips parted. \u201cI truly don\u2019t know. But to make a long story short, over the last few years I\u2019ve discovered an ability to . . . coerce people to obey me for short periods of time.\u201d</p><p>Roke made a sound of disgust. \u201cCoerce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s more of an enchantment,\u201d she reluctantly conceded. \u201cBut I\u2019ve only used it once or twice on humans. Until a few weeks ago it was never strong enough to influence demons, and then it was only a hellhound. I never dreamed it could affect a vampire. It was only because I was desperate I even tried.\u201d</p><p>Styx\u2019s gaze transferred to Roke. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when you mated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t notice the bonding until the initial spell was broken.\u201d Roke\u2019s grip tightened on his companion\u2019s slender shoulder. \u201cOr at least, when Sally claims it was broken.\u201d</p><p>With an impatient gesture, Sally lifted her arm, waving the crimson marking beneath his nose.</p><p>\u201cYou think that if there was a way to get rid of this I would hesitate for even a heartbeat?\u201d she squawked. \u201cThe last thing I want is to be tied to a leech.\u201d</p><p>Roke stiffened as her accusation sent a stab of anger through his heart. As if he were . . . what? Upset by her fierce rejection of their bonding? She was only saying what was exactly on his mind, wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>Thankfully his ridiculous broodings were interrupted by Styx.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t exchange blood?\u201d</p><p>Roke shook his head, refusing to acknowledge the ruthless hunger that had plagued him since Sally had trapped him in her spell. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange.\u201d Styx pushed away from the desk, stepping toward Sally. \u201cYou have no idea what demon blood runs in your veins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour magic interferes with my senses. Perhaps your blood . . .\u201d Styx\u2019s words were bitten off as Roke abruptly shoved Sally behind his rigid body, his lips peeled back to emphasize his fully exposed fangs. \u201cShit, Roke,\u201d the ancient vampire muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not tasting her blood,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Styx scowled, the icy throb of his power warning Roke who was in charge.</p><p>\u201cUnless we discover what kind of demon she is, we won\u2019t know how this happened.\u201d He allowed a strategic pause. \u201cOr if it can be reversed.\u201d</p><p>Roke refused to back down. \u201cNo one takes her blood but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Sally protested, kicking Roke on the back of his leg.</p><p>The two men ignored her.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Styx snapped. \u201cFor now we can hope this is the result of her demon powers. If you take her blood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s taking my blood\u2014are we clear on that?\u201d Sally again intruded into their conversation, this time giving Roke a punch to the arm.</p><p>Styx arched a startled brow as he glanced toward the furious witch. \u201cShe\u2019s feisty for such a little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a pain in the ass,\u201d Roke muttered.</p><p>She growled. Not an animal growl. But an I\u2019m-so-pissed-I-could-kill-you growl. \u201cSomeday I\u2019m truly going to turn you into a newt,\u201d she threatened Roke.</p><p>Without warning Styx tilted back his head to laugh with genuine amusement. \u201cI\u2019d go for a cave troll if I were you,\u201d he informed the astonished Sally. \u201cHis vanity could use a few warts.\u201d</p><p>Roke glared at his king. Traitor. \u201cI\u2019m glad you can find humor in this.\u201d</p><p>Styx shrugged. \u201cImagine my reaction when I found myself mated to a pure-blooded Were.\u201d</p><p>An emotion he refused to identify darted through Roke at the thought of this powerful vampire with Darcy. There was no mistaking the fact that the two adored one another and had no embarrassment in displaying their love whenever they were together.</p><p>Not that he wanted that sort of mating, he hastily reassured himself. His heart and loyalty belonged to his clan.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d he said roughly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose it is.\u201d With a grimace Styx reached to grasp Roke\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my brother, we\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d</p><p>Roke avoided glancing at the woman who had turned his life upside down. \u201cWe damned well better,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>There was an awkward silence as Roke felt Sally take a deliberate step away, shaking off his clinging hand.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me about this book,\u201d Styx commanded.</p><p>Resisting the urge to wrap his arm around the female and tuck her back against his side, Roke rigidly concentrated on Styx\u2019s abrupt change in conversation.</p><p>\u201cIt was hidden in a safe that was bricked over in an abandoned warehouse ten miles north of here.\u201d</p><p>Styx nodded, not bothering to ask how Roke had managed to knock through the bricks to expose the safe. \u201cAnd why do we need a witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s protected by black magic,\u201d Sally answered. \u201cDeadly to anyone foolish enough to touch it.\u201d</p><p>Styx curled his lips in the typical vampire reaction to magic. \u201cCan you get rid of it?\u201d</p><p>Sally hesitated before giving a wary nod. \u201cI think so, but the magic was more potent than any I\u2019ve tried to deal with before. It will take time and specific ingredients to prepare a counterspell with enough punch to break through.\u201d</p><p>Styx was speaking before Roke could protest. \u201cDarcy will get what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but I\u2019m not returning to the dungeons,\u201d she warned. \u201cIf you want my help, then you can\u2019t treat me like a prisoner.\u201d</p><p>The Anasso studied her with a narrowed gaze. \u201cI have your word that you won\u2019t try to escape?\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise. \u201cYou trust the word of a witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have your word?\u201d Styx repeated, his voice as hard as granite.</p><p>Sally shrugged, lifting her arm to reveal the mating mark. \u201cI swear I\u2019m not leaving until you get rid of this. Good enough?\u201d</p><p>Styx gave a rueful nod. \u201cGood enough. You\u2019ll find Darcy in the kitchen. Just tell her what you need.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clearly thinking it had to be a trap, the tiny witch backed her way out of the door, never taking her gaze off the massive Aztec warrior.</p><p>Roke watched her wary departure with gritted teeth, telling himself to let her go. The more space between them the better.</p><p>But the instant she was out of sight, his good intentions shattered. With a muttered curse he was heading out of the room, catching his fleeing prey just as she was turning the corner.</p> <p>\u201cSally.\u201d</p><p>Coming to a grudging halt, the witch turned to send him a sullen frown. \u201cWhat do you want? I already gave my word I wouldn\u2019t escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d he said, grabbing her wrist to study the delicate tattoo with a brooding gaze. Mate. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere in the world you could go where I wouldn\u2019t find you.\u201d</p><p>It took a minute for her to realize that their connection meant he would always know where she was. Hell, he would know what she was feeling, and if he truly concentrated, he would know what she was doing.</p><p>The blush faded to a sickly white, her eyes velvet dark. \u201cThen what do you want?\u201d</p> <p>Want? His fangs lengthened. What he wanted was to yank her into his arms and sink his aching fangs deep into her throat. His body wasn\u2019t conflicted. It accepted this woman was now his and it wanted to indulge in all the benefits of a mate.</p><p>But, Styx was right, as much as he hated to agree with the oversized mother hen.</p><p>Besides, he had a more pressing reason for charging after her.</p><p>\u201cIs this spell dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be if I make a mistake in mixing the ingredients or when I cast the actual spell.\u201d She frowned, clearly baffled by his question. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to worry, I\u2019ll create a protective circle before I begin. You won\u2019t be in any danger.\u201d</p><p>He took a step forward, standing close enough to be drenched in her peach-scented warmth. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p> <p>She licked her dry lips. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple. Will you be at risk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe caster is always at risk. Why?\u201d</p><p>His thumb rubbed her inner wrist, lingering on the feel of her racing pulse as his gaze rested on her damp lips.</p><p>Oh . . . hell.</p><p>He was in trouble.</p><p>Ass-deep, never-be-the-same-again trouble.</p><p>\u201cFor better or worse you\u2019re my mate,\u201d he rasped.</p> <p>\u201cSo . . .\u201d Her eyes widened in sudden horror. \u201cOh. Do vampires die if something happens to their mates?\u201d</p><p>He shuddered, unable to even imagine the devastating sense of loss.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ll wish I was dead.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Outside the dragon lair</p><p>Nefri ignored Santiago\u2019s bristling annoyance as she stepped toward the small female demon.</p><p>\u201cYannah. Did your mother send you?\u201d</p><p>Yannah gave a sniff, waving her hand toward the scowling vampire and sulking gargoyle. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to say in front of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Nefri wisely hid her smile as she pointed toward the small copse of trees. \u201cPerhaps we can step over here?\u201d</p><p>Santiago made a strangled sound. \u201cNefri, we don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>Yannah widened her black eyes, the heavy pressure of her magic beginning to swirl through the air. \u201cI\u2019m a messenger from the Commission,\u201d she announced. \u201cEveryone has time for me.\u201d</p><p>Without warning Levet tossed his hands in the air. \u201cThere. You see? How is a man supposed to live with such a bossy creature?\u201d</p><p>Nefri sent a warning glance toward Santiago, who had a sudden glint of amusement in his eyes. \u201cCareful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not saying a word,\u201d he said, an exaggerated expression of innocence on his handsome face.</p><p>\u201cGood choice,\u201d she murmured, turning back to the female demon. \u201cShall we, Yannah?\u201d</p><p>Together they moved over the uneven ground, not halting until they were far enough away to avoid being overheard by even a vampire.</p><p>\u201cWhy must men be so difficult?\u201d Yannah abruptly burst out.</p><p>\u201cI have come to the conclusion it\u2019s a genetic defect of males,\u201d Nefri consoled her companion. \u201cThat would explain why their numerous faults appear to include all species.\u201d</p><p>Yannah gave a slow nod. \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence as they pondered the oddity of the male gender, and then Nefri was giving a shake of her head. \u201cI believe you have a message for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes.\u201d Yannah smoothed tiny hands down her white robe. \u201cMy mother says \u2018That which was lost is found again.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Nefri remained silent, waiting for the rest of the message. At least until she realized that Yannah was staring at her with an expectant expression.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Nefri frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. What was lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d Yannah gave an impatient wave of her hand. \u201cI\u2019m just the messenger.\u201d</p><p>Nefri was careful to keep her expression devoid of her stab of frustration. Yannah might appear to be a child, but she had enough power to destroy them all.</p><p>\u201cVery well. Thank you, Yannah.\u201d She offered a small bow. \u201cI will be sure to tell Siljar that you performed your task with honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must return.\u201d Yannah glanced toward the two men who stood in stiff silence. \u201cYou\u2019ll keep him safe?\u201d</p><p>Nefri nodded, sensing Yannah\u2019s concern was genuine, despite her enjoyment in nagging the small gargoyle. \u201cI will do everything in my power to make certain he isn\u2019t harmed,\u201d she promised softly.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>With a last, longing glance at Levet, the small demon abruptly disappeared, leaving behind the scent of brimstone.</p><p>Nefri gave a faint shake of her head and slowly returned to her companions.</p><p>Why on earth had Siljar sent her daughter to share such a vague message? It wasn\u2019t as if she could actually use it to her advantage. Not when she didn\u2019t have a clue what it meant.</p><p>Instinctively moving to stand beside Santiago, Nefri was prepared for Levet\u2019s scowl as he realized she was alone.</p><p>\u201cWhere did Yannah go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had to return to the Commission,\u201d Nefri said in distracted tones.</p><p>\u201cHmmph. Typical,\u201d the gargoyle muttered, his wings drooping in the moonlight. \u201cShe comes here to pick a fight and then just disappears when she realizes I\u2019m winning.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the grouchy Levet, Santiago reached to tuck Nefri\u2019s hair behind her ear as he studied her with a worried gaze. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said, \u2018That which was lost is found again.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Santiago was predictably unimpressed. \u201cWhat was found?\u201d</p><p>Nefri grimaced. \u201cThat was the message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe entire message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what it means?\u201d</p><p>Nefri shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic,\u201d Santiago growled. \u201cSo are we supposed to wait around for the Oracles?\u201d</p><p>Nefri didn\u2019t hesitate. With every passing minute the danger to the world increased. \u201cNo. We need to find Gaius.\u201d</p><p>Santiago studied her with a searching gaze. \u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure,\u201d she admitted. Siljar had demanded that Gaius be captured, but Nefri wasn\u2019t going to sacrifice Santiago. If push came to shove she would kill her former clansman, and she would do it without hesitation. \u201cBut he has to be stopped.\u201d</p><p>Santiago nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes held as they silently shared their growing concern, then the moment was interrupted as Levet pressed his face against her leg to sniff her jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you smell like dragon?\u201d</p><p>With a low growl, Santiago leaned down to grab the gargoyle by his stunted horn, pulling him away from Nefri as if he was jealous of the tiny creature. \u201cDoes he have to come?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She gave a firm nod. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Levet yanked free of Santiago\u2019s grasp, glaring at the male vampire. \u201cWhat is the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>Santiago scowled. \u201cDo you have to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Levet gave a sharp flap of his wings. \u201cIt is supposed to be farts before tarts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Santiago made a sound of disgust. \u201cOh, for god\u2019s sake, it\u2019s \u2018bros before hos.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not very polite,\u201d Levet protested in shocked tones, his gaze moving to Nefri. \u201cForgive his crassness, ma belle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do my best,\u201d she assured the gargoyle.</p><p>\u201cI need to call Styx and update him,\u201d Santiago muttered, digging his phone out of his front pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the truck.\u201d</p><p>She sent him an overly innocent smile. \u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I insist.\u201d</p><p>With a light touch on Levet\u2019s wing, she steered him toward the rugged path that eventually would lead to the truck parked in the foothills. As much as she enjoyed watching the tiny gargoyle drive Santiago nuts, she didn\u2019t want him pressing his luck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Poking at an angry male vampire was never a good idea.</p><p>\u201cCome along, Levet.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d left the meadow and were traveling down the narrow path when Levet returned to his previous question. \u201cYou were with a dragon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were.\u201d She grimaced, wishing the powerful beast had offered more than vague warnings. \u201cHe revealed this spirit that we\u2019re tracking might be the creator of vampires.\u201d</p><p>The gray eyes widened in shock. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds . . .\u201d Levet shuddered in horror. \u201cSacrebleu, I do not even have the words.\u201d</p><p>Nefri gave a slow nod. \u201cMy thoughts exactly.\u201d</p> <p>Even driving like a bat out of hell (a rather appropriate metaphor for a vampire), Santiago was forced to accept that they weren\u2019t going to reach Gaius.</p><p>They could have ditched the truck and moved faster on foot, but expending that much energy would have meant facing the vampire and a potential god of vampires when they were at their weakest.</p><p>Santiago was impulsive, but he wasn\u2019t suicidal.</p><p>Seeming to come to the same conclusion, Nefri sent him a questioning glance over the head of the ridiculous gargoyle who was perched between them. \u201cCan you sense him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still north of us.\u201d Santiago grimaced. \u201cClose, but too far to pinpoint before dawn.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWe should find a place to rest for the day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOui.\u201d Levet abruptly seemed to come awake, bouncing up and down on the seat. \u201cFinding caves is my specialty.\u201d</p><p>Santiago shuddered. Twelve hours stuck in a damp cave with this aggravating gargoyle? No way in hell.</p><p>Which was exactly why he\u2019d chosen this particular route. Thank the gods.</p><p>\u201cActually Viper has a club not far from here.\u201d</p><p>Nefri blinked, as if surprised by his claim. \u201cAnother club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a dozen or more.\u201d Santiago shrugged. \u201cSome higher rent than others.\u201d</p><p>Her brows drew together, no doubt expecting the usual offering of blood, sex, and violence. \u201cAnd this one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Summerset Club is one of the more elegant establishments.\u201d He sent her a wry grin. \u201cNot one cage or orgy to be found.\u201d</p> <p>He expected a responding smile; instead Nefri studied him with an oddly searching gaze.</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrgies?\u201d He gave a teasing waggle of his brows. Not that he\u2019d ever been into public displays. And now . . . he couldn\u2019t imagine being intimate with any female but Nefri in public or private. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>She refused to be distracted. \u201cThe fighting.\u201d</p><p>He knew what she meant. After spending centuries fighting for his life on a nightly basis, no one had been more shocked than he was when Viper suggested that he manage a club renowned for its cage matches.</p><p>But after spending time in the club, he finally realized it was exactly what he needed.</p><p>\u201cJust the opposite,\u201d he admitted, slowing the truck to take the off-ramp. \u201cIt\u2019s cathartic.\u201d</p><p>She cast a brief glance around the cornfields before returning her attention to him. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in control now,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat means only demons 100 percent willing can enter the cages, and those who try to force a fighter into the matches answer to me. I can also make sure that the opponents are evenly matched and that the battle is ended before irreparable damage can be done.\u201d He took another turn onto a gravel road. \u201cThere\u2019s also a strict policy against masos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMasos?\u201d she asked.</p><p>It was Levet who answered with a wrinkle of his snout. \u201cA demon who gets off on pain, ma belle.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhy do you care if they enjoy being hurt?\u201d</p><p>He offered a wicked smile. \u201cPleasurable pain is an extra charge.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened in distaste. \u201cCharming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo each his own,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>Santiago slowed to a mere crawl, his senses on high alert. For most people this deserted path several miles south of Iowa City would have seemed like a road to nowhere, but he was well aware that there lurked a number of nasty surprises for those who dared to trespass.</p><p>The Summerset Club was one of Viper\u2019s more exclusive establishments and was guarded with better surveillance than Area 51.</p><p>Of course, he\u2019d been a part of Viper\u2019s inner circle long enough that even the lowest ranking vampires would easily recognize him. He hoped that there wouldn\u2019t be any trouble passing through the hidden checkpoints.</p><p>He turned twice more before they arrived at the manicured parkland that surrounded the sprawling colonial building.</p><p>Painted white with black shutters, the central double door was flanked by high, arched windows and a wide porch with fluted columns. The roof was low-pitched with a balustrade that connected the two long wings to the central house.</p><p>Pulling the truck to a halt at the side drive, he shut off the engine. One of the flunkies would move it later.</p><p>\u201cThis is it.\u201d</p><p>They crawled out of the truck and headed toward the door. Or at least, Santiago and Nefri headed that way.</p><p>The ridiculous gargoyle hovered on the drive.</p><p>\u201cLevet?\u201d Nefri murmured.</p><p>\u201cI should try to contact Yannah,\u201d the gargoyle said, his tone indicating that he wasn\u2019t overly eager to confront the female. \u201cI will return at nightfall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to hurry back on my account,\u201d Santiago muttered.</p><p>Levet sniffed, pointing a claw toward Santiago. \u201cYou should take lessons in how to treat a hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you how I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSantiago.\u201d Nefri grabbed his arm, her attention remaining on the three-foot pest. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you at dusk.\u201d</p><p>Levet gave a dip of his head. \u201cBon.\u201d With a flap of his fairy wings, the creature was taking off, no doubt making the surrounding guards wonder if they were hallucinating.</p><p>Santiago gave a shake of his head. \u201cWhy do you encourage him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe truly is a hero.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. And wasn\u2019t that a kick in the fangs?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, well, look what the cat dragged in,\u201d a smooth male voice with a distinct English accent drawled from the side door. \u201cDid you slip Viper\u2019s leash?\u201d</p><p>Santiago jerked around to glare at the tall, slender vampire with light brown hair that was cut short on the sides and layered on top to lay with glossy perfection. His face was chiseled with an austere beauty that Santiago considered arrogant but the females seemed to find enthralling. His eyes were so dark a blue they looked black from a distance and usually shimmered with a wicked amusement that disguised his razor-sharp intelligence.</p><p>As always, he presented the image of the ultimate gentleman. Elegant, perfectly polished. And attired in a black Armani tuxedo that cost more than Santiago had spent in the past century on his clothes.</p><p>With a roll of his eyes, Santiago climbed the steps to stand face to face with the vampire he\u2019d known since his days in the pits.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the only Gladiator who Styx had rescued.</p><p>\u201cGabriel. We need rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The vampire\u2019s gaze shifted over Santiago\u2019s shoulder, an expression of male appreciation settling on his face. \u201cIs this your latest? Nice. Very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d Santiago snapped, plagued with a sudden desire to rip out those blue peepers. \u201cThis is clan chief Nefri.\u201d</p><p>The hint of sexual invitation was abruptly replaced with a bone-deep reverence as the older vampire performed a smooth bow. \u201cMy lady, forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Nefri murmured softly, moving to stand at Santiago\u2019s side, \u201ccall me Nefri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve honored my humble establishment.\u201d Straightening, Gabriel waved a hand toward the open door. \u201cPlease follow me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Santiago didn\u2019t know why he was so discombobulated (who the hell would have thought he would use such a prissy-ass word, even in the privacy of his mind?). He\u2019d known from the moment he\u2019d crossed paths with Nefri that she was more than just a powerful clan chief.</p><p>It was impossible to miss the fact that she was far superior to others.</p><p>But his overriding bitterness at Gaius\u2019s defection behind the Veil had made him ignore his instinct to treat her as a rare treasure. Then, even worse, his male desire had kicked in. It\u2019d insisted that he deny the knowledge that this female was far too good for a former Gladiator who was more comfortable among the dregs of society than royalty.</p><p>And she was royalty, even if she didn\u2019t carry the title of queen.</p><p>A fact hammered home with painful clarity as the vampires and a handful of fey crowded around her in speechless awe. Even among the most aristocratic members of society she was a VIP.</p><p>Hell, they barely gave her enough space to sip the blood that was brought to her in a Baccarat crystal glass on a silver tray. Oh, and then there\u2019d been the scramble among females to assure Nefri they\u2019d have fresh clothing sent from the most exclusive designers, clearly hoping to use this accidental meeting with the Great Nefri to inflate their own standing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a torturous hour of watching the crowd fawn over the always gracious Nefri, Gabriel at last led them down the stairs to the hidden tunnels beneath the building.</p><p>The club didn\u2019t encourage guests to linger during the daylight hours, but there were always spare rooms. Of course, unlike Santiago\u2019s humble establishment, these rooms were the size of most apartments and decorated in soothing shades of gray and silver.</p><p>Discreet, expensive, and sophisticated.</p> <p>Escorting them into the sitting room with a low, velvet sofa and hand-carved coffee table, Gabriel placed a hand over his heart and offered a deep bow. \u201cYou\u2019re certain you have everything you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Nefri assured him with a warm smile. \u201cThis is lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hit the zero on the phone if you want room service,\u201d Gabriel said, the jaded vampire clearly dazzled by Nefri. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, as if Gabriel was having difficulty tearing himself away, then with a last dip of his head, he backed out of the room and closed the door.</p> <p>A thick silence filled the air as Santiago moved to the wet bar that came complete with his favorite tequila.</p><p>Pouring a large shot, he downed it in one gulp. On the point of pouring another, he was halted when Nefri laid a gentle hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cSantiago?\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened on the glass before he was setting it aside and turning to meet her worried gaze. \u201cS\u00ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, wishing he\u2019d managed a couple more shots before she\u2019d interfered. He was feeling . . . raw. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p> <p>Her brows snapped together. \u201cYou\u2019ve barely said a word since we\u2019ve arrived. And you have that\u201d\u2014she gave a wave of her hand\u2014\u201cthat broody male thing going on.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cBroody male thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d She searched his guarded expression. \u201cSomething is obviously bothering you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you . . . it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI thought it was a woman\u2019s prerogative to pretend she\u2019s not upset when she clearly is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She moved a step closer, wrapping him in her sweet jasmine scent. \u201cPlease, tell me.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. Dammit. He wasn\u2019t a \u201ctouchy feely\u201d kind of vampire under the best of circumstances. Unless it was in bed. When his emotions were involved he became as articulate as a grunting orc.</p> <p>\u201cI sometimes forget,\u201d he eventually muttered.</p><p>\u201cForget what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Nefri,\u201d he said. \u201cA creature of myth and legend.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in confusion. \u201cAre you speaking in code?\u201d</p><p>He reached up to yank the leather tie from his hair, ramming his fingers through the thick strands in an effort to relieve the tension throbbing in his head. It didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cVampires all over this world would worship at your feet,\u201d he said, his voice rough. \u201cHell, you\u2019re treated like a queen by a dragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned, as if she was annoyed by his words. \u201cFine, let\u2019s say for argument\u2019s sake that you\u2019re right. What does that have to do with why you\u2019re treating me like I carry the plague?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are . . .\u201d He struggled for the words.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay out of my league,\u201d he finally managed to say, expressing the fear that burned deep in his soul.</p><p>Without warning Nefri was slapping a hand across his mouth, her eyes snapping with anger. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d</p><p>He grasped her wrist and gently tugged her fingers from his face. Now that he\u2019d started, he intended to finish.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t ignore the truth, querida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is that I\u2019m just a vampire with all the flaws and weaknesses of any other,\u201d she claimed, even as she stood there in a blaze of glorious beauty. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you that the Oracles spread rumors to disguise the truth of why they created the Veil.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. Where was she going with this? \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the rumors expanded to include me and my clan when we left this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour power is no rumor. And neither is your beauty,\u201d he countered. \u201cGabriel would have sliced open his throat if he thought it would please you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twisted into a humorless smile. \u201cNot me. His vision of who he thinks I am, or at least who I should be.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around her waist, a white fang nibbling on the fullness of her lower lip. He stifled a groan at the memory of those cherry lips skimming down his body. He was supposed to be concentrating on the reasons to keep this female at a distance, not dwelling on the devastating pleasure she\u2019d given him.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s my fault. Over the centuries it suited me to play the role of the aloof, mysterious clan chief. If people feared me, then it allowed my clan to live in peace away from our enemies.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, bothered by the sense that she was apologizing for some sin she\u2019d never committed. At least not as far as he was concerned. \u201cYou did what was necessary,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI did more than was necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI not only used my legendary reputation to keep my enemies at a distance, but everyone.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. He\u2019d been well aware of the distance she kept between herself and others. But he hadn\u2019t been certain if it had been on purpose or simply a defense mechanism.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She held his gaze, for the first time allowing him to truly see the ancient betrayal smoldering in her dark eyes. \u201cBecause then I could be absolutely certain no one would ever again use me as a tool for their own gain.\u201d</p><p>Before he could halt the need to touch her, Santiago reached to gently cup her face in his hands. \u201cI understand, cara. I truly do.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. He was one of the few demons who actually could make the claim.</p><p>\u201cI was satisfied with my choices until . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>He flinched at the blunt answer, not sure whether to sink to his knees in gratitude or shake some sense into her.</p><p>In the end he simply regarded her with a desperate hope. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou reminded me that I\u2019m more than a clan chief,\u201d she said in low, husky tones. \u201cI\u2019m a woman.\u201d</p><p>A groan escaped his lips as his gaze lowered to the slender curves that emphatically proclaimed her womanhood. \u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>Her hands lifted to rest on his shoulders. \u201cA very lonely woman who was too cowardly to risk sharing herself.\u201d</p><p>He muttered a curse. Just for a few minutes, he\u2019d been determined to do the right thing. To stop his compulsive need to blast through her wary shields and instead return to his role of a protector. Nothing, after all, was more important than making sure they halted Gaius and the mysterious spirit before they could create even more havoc.</p><p>Now, his resolve faltered.</p><p>Because of the edge of vulnerability in her voice?</p><p>Or because he was a selfish bastard who urgently wanted to believe she needed him with the same intensity he needed her?</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>A hint of amusement drove the shadows from her eyes. \u201cAre you seeking compliments?\u201d</p><p>His thumb rubbed her lower lip. \u201cI won\u2019t say no to any you want to offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d She pretended to consider her words. \u201cFor one thing, you\u2019re the only vampire I\u2019ve met who is too stubborn to take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your compliment?\u201d he complained. \u201cI\u2019m stubborn?\u201d</p><p>Her smile widened, revealing a sexy hint of fang. \u201cYour ego doesn\u2019t need for me to tell you that you\u2019re impossibly gorgeous and so sexy that females melt whenever you walk past them.\u201d</p><p>Desire roared through him, searing away his futile attempt at sanity. \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he murmured. \u201cTell me more about how I make you melt.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded, leaving behind an achingly somber expression. \u201cI have no words that explain why it was you, Santiago. It\u2019s more than your courage and loyalty and the goodness in your heart that you try to hide.\u201d Her hands slid over his chest, the light caress sending lightning bolts of pleasure through his clenched body. \u201cIt is\u2014and always will be\u2014you.\u201d</p><p>The world came to a complete, perfect halt.</p><p>She captured the truth in those seven simple words.</p><p>It defined his very existence.</p><p>The knowledge exploded through him with a nuclear force. Bright and shiny and soul shattering.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed.

It was an unconscious reflex, but one that he did on a regular basis. Which proved Styx was right. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Styx held his frustrated glare. \u201cFor now you need to concentrate on yourself.\u201d</p><p>Infuriated by the constant reminder that he was well and truly trapped, Roke slammed a door on his bond with Sally, momentarily succeeding in blunting his awareness of her.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t last more than a few minutes. But it was a tiny win for his ravaged pride.</p><p>\u201cI knew that witch was going to be trouble,\u201d he muttered, a bitterness edging his words. \u201cOf course, all women are trouble in one way or another.\u201d</p><p>Styx blinked, as if startled by his vehemence. \u201cYou don\u2019t like women? Hell, I never considered the possibility.\u201d</p><p>Roke snorted. He wasn\u2019t offended. Immortality meant vampires who weren\u2019t mated often experimented with different genders, different species, and a wide variety of sexual appetites.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m physically attracted to females,\u201d he corrected Styx.</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d Styx said. \u201cNot that I give a damn one way or another, but the female will be bound to you until we can find a way to break the mating. You don\u2019t need any additional\u201d\u2014he searched for a word to cover the hideous situation\u2014\u201cconfusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfusion?\u201d It was Roke\u2019s turn to pace from one end of the office to the other. \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Styx grimaced. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way to free you from the witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, Roke,\u201d Styx murmured.</p><p>Abruptly Roke realized his anger was causing the floor to shake beneath their feet. Unlike some vampires, his own powers had little effect on electrical objects, but he could cause significant structural damage if he lost control.</p><p>With a grim effort, he leashed his powers. That didn\u2019t, however, ease his frustration, which threatened to combust at the least provocation.</p><p>\u201cThis is . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nightmare,\u201d Styx murmured. \u201cI got that.\u201d</p><p>Roke clenched his fists, his gaze trained on the glass cabinet that held Styx\u2019s priceless collection of ancient scrolls. \u201cDid you know my previous clan chief?\u201d he asked abruptly. He could sense Styx\u2019s confusion.</p><p>\u201cGunnar occasionally petitioned my master, but he tended to be a recluse when he visited. I doubt I exchanged half a dozen words with him,\u201d Styx at last admitted. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Roke had to force the words past his stiff lips. Speaking about his former clan chief was always difficult. Even after all these years. \u201cWhen Gunnar allowed me to join his clan he was a stable leader who demanded obedience, but treated us with a justice rarely found in those days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were fortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d Roke agreed. Before the previous Anasso had taken control, vampires had been little better than savage beasts who brutalized one another as easily as they brutalized lesser demons. It was nothing less than a miracle to find a clan that respected one another. \u201cUntil Gunnar found his mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany clan chiefs are mated.\u201d</p><p>Roke curled his lip. \u201cNot to a female who is so vain and needy that she demands constant attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis mate was a vampire?\u201d Styx demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes, but very weak,\u201d he explained, not bothering to disguise his disgust for the female who\u2019d destroyed so much. \u201cHer only true power was her beauty and she used it like a weapon to get her way. Gunnar went from being a strong, decisive leader of a clan no one would dare to attack, to a slave to his lusts who spent so much time pandering to his female we lost everything.\u201d</p><p>He sensed it as Styx moved to stand at his side. \u201cEverything?\u201d</p><p>He gave a restless shrug. \u201cThe mines that made our wealth were allowed to be overrun with humans and the majority of our land was taken by a rival vampire clan, along with our best warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Gunnar?\u201d</p><p>Roke hesitated. The history of his clan wasn\u2019t a secret. But the ultimate fate of Gunnar was something that was never discussed.</p><p>Not by anyone.</p><p>\u201cWhile I traveled to enter the battles of Durotriges he was killed when his lair was struck by lightning and burned to the ground.\u201d He reluctantly turned to meet Styx\u2019s unwavering gaze. \u201cOr that was the story I was given.\u201d</p><p>Predictably the older vampire pounced on his suggestive words. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made no secret of the fact that if I survived the battles I intended to challenge Gunnar to become the chief.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cI fear . . .\u201d</p><p>Styx laid a hand on his shoulder. \u201cRoke?\u201d</p><p>The memory of his beloved sire burned through his brain. The female vampire had been a wisewoman before being turned, and while she had no memory of her past, she possessed an unshakable belief in mystic portents.</p><p>Including an omen that she\u2019d read the night Roke was turned.</p><p>She\u2019d claimed that it meant that Roke would one day be a great leader.</p><p>He\u2019d always humored the ancient vampire, never suspecting she might take matters into her own hands.</p><p>At least not until Gunnar was dead.</p><p>\u201cI suspect that someone made certain there wouldn\u2019t be any chance of me losing that challenge,\u201d he grudgingly admitted.</p><p>Thankfully Styx didn\u2019t press for answers Roke had no intention of giving. Instead he gave Roke\u2019s shoulder an understanding squeeze. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve been so anxious to return to your people,\u201d he said, his words a statement, not a question.</p><p>Roke nodded. \u201cI swore when they made me their chief I would devote myself to protecting them. Instead I\u2019ve abandoned them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t abandon them,\u201d Styx interrupted him, his hawkish features unyielding. \u201cI forced you to remain in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe result is the same. They\u2019re without their leader,\u201d Roke pointed out in sour tones, refusing to console himself with the knowledge he\u2019d left them in perfectly capable hands. Kale might be dependable enough, but it was Roke\u2019s responsibility to be with his clan. \u201cAnd now, for the true cherry topper, I\u2019m mated to a witch who not only sold her soul to the Dark Lord, but who hates vampires.\u201d</p><p>Styx\u2019s fingers tightened to a painful grip. \u201cRoke . . .\u201d</p><p>He shrugged off the warning hand, on a sudden roll. \u201cHell, I couldn\u2019t possibly have been trapped with a worse mate if I tried.\u201d</p><p>The scent of peaches filled the air. No, not peaches . . . scorched peaches. As if the scrumptious fruit had been tossed in a raging fire.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Slowly turning, Roke met the furious glare of his mate, forced to hastily duck as she tossed a heavy crystal vase at his head.</p><p>\u201cRight back at you,\u201d she hissed, tossing another vase. \u201cJackass.\u201d</p><p>Roke groaned. His only emotion should be relief that the female hadn\u2019t been able to use her magic. He would no doubt be missing a vital part of his male anatomy right now.</p><p>Instead, all he could feel was a fierce, searing need to gather the angry Sally in his arms and promise that she would never be hurt again.</p><p>Especially not by him.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Gauis\u2019s lair in Wisconsin</p><p>Gaius struggled to shake off the clinging sense of lethargy that shrouded him in a thick blanket of unconsciousness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hated the sensation.</p><p>He hated it even more when he could sense a presence leaning over his helpless body.</p><p>With a threatening growl, he forced open his heavy lids, relieved to discover he\u2019d taken the precaution of spending the day on a narrow cot in the cellar. The house might be sun-proof, but an enemy could always find a way to break through his shutters and expose him to the deadly rays.</p> <p>Especially when he was so deeply asleep he couldn\u2019t detect an approaching trespasser.</p><p>Surging upward, he discovered Dara standing near the narrow door that was the only entrance to the cellar. She smiled as she slid an affectionate glance over his rumpled hair and naked body.</p><p>\u201cHabibi, are you rested?\u201d she asked in her soft voice.</p><p>He scrubbed a hand over his face, sensing that night had fallen while he\u2019d been unconscious. \u201cHow long have I been asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you returned last eve.\u201d Her smile widened. \u201cYou were always a lazy bug after you overindulged.\u201d</p> <p>He grimaced. He\u2019d done more than overindulge. He\u2019d wallowed in a bloodlust that had been shocking even by his standards. And still he\u2019d remained plagued by a gnawing hunger that refused to be appeased.</p><p>It was only the threat of dawn that had forced him to gather the few remaining mortals and return to his temporary lair.</p><p>\u201cThe humans?\u201d he rasped, assuming something must be wrong for Dara to seek him out.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re safely locked in the attic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s troubling you?\u201d</p><p>Her beautiful eyes shimmered with a strange glow, as if they were being lit from within. \u201cSomething that should have remained hidden is now found,\u201d she whispered, the glow from her eyes filling the cellar with an eerie light.</p> <p>He took an unconscious step backward. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be one of the witches.\u201d Her brows pulled together, her tone absent.</p><p>\u201cI thought we killed the last of them.\u201d</p><p>She pretended she didn\u2019t hear him. Or maybe she wasn\u2019t pretending. Gaius smiled wryly. It seemed the only time Dara truly acknowledged his presence was when she needed something.</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps it\u2019s one of the Oracles.\u201d She gave a slow nod. \u201cYes, that is possible.\u201d</p><p>Gaius went rigid, an icy ball of dread forming in the pit of his stomach. \u201cThey\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But I\u2019ve felt them searching for me.\u201d Dara\u2019s eyes returned to liquid pools of darkness. \u201cThey know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are they searching for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you.\u201d She regarded him with a beseeching plea that arrowed straight to his heart. \u201cThey don\u2019t like vampires returning from the grave. They will seek to banish me from this world.\u201d</p><p>With a reluctance that shamed him, Gaius moved forward to lightly brush a hand over her cheek. As always he was struck by the unpleasant sensation that his hand was passing through air.</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t let that happen,\u201d he swore. \u201cNot again.\u201d</p><p>She moved back, dislodging his hand, but her smile was as warm as the long forgotten sun. \u201cI knew I could depend on you, habibi.\u201d</p><p>Yes. He pressed a hand to his temple, trying to clear the weary fog from his mind. His mate depended on him. It was his duty to do whatever was necessary to protect her.</p><p>\u201cWe must hide,\u201d he murmured, shifting through the various possibilities. They had to lay low until the Commission lost interest. \u201cWe can return to our lair in Italy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, eventually,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut not yet.\u201d</p><p>Gaius frowned. \u201cDara, I don\u2019t have the strength to fight the Commission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to fight the entire Commission,\u201d she assured him. \u201cOnly their two emissaries.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother asking how she could feel the approach of the Oracles, or how she seemed to mysteriously know that they\u2019d sent two emissaries.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted the answers.</p><p>\u201cWho did they send?\u201d he instead demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe female clan chief.\u201d</p><p>Gaius hissed. There was more than one female clan chief, of course. But, there was only one whom the Oracles would send to try and capture him.</p><p>\u201cNefri.\u201d He clenched his hands, pretending the raw stab of guilt was anger. He wasn\u2019t going to admit that he\u2019d abused Nefri\u2019s generous trust. What choice did he have? The Dark Lord had lured him with promises of Dara. Any vampire would betray their people for their beloved mate. \u201cDamn her. How can she know I survived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Oracles, no doubt.\u201d Dara\u2019s features twisted with a bitter fury before her eyes grew distant, as if she were looking at something far away. \u201cNow that is intriguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer companion.\u201d She slowly smiled. \u201cThis promises to be an interesting reunion.\u201d</p><p>Reunion?</p><p>Gaius began to shake his head in bafflement only to freeze as he was struck by the haunting memory of being ripped through the rift by the Dark Lord. At the time his only thought was to scurry away from the raging battle, but he was certain that he\u2019d caught a glimpse of an unconscious Nefri being held in the arms of an all-too familiar vampire.</p><p>\u201cSantiago,\u201d he said, his voice harsh.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Dara\u2019s expression was . . . what? It almost appeared smug. \u201cOur son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gaius paced across the cramped space, hating the sick regret that flowed like acid through him at the thought of Santiago. \u201cNo longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will always be ours, Gaius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He hunched a defensive shoulder. He didn\u2019t want to speak about his son. Of all the sacrifices he\u2019d made, Santiago was the one that would always torment him.</p><p>Feeling the weight of Dara\u2019s stare, he at last muttered a low curse. \u201cI betrayed him when I sold my soul to the Dark Lord and then I abandoned him and he became a slave to the blood pits,\u201d he forced out. \u201cHe\u2019ll never forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s angry and confused,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He gave a sharp, bitter laugh. \u201cHe has every right to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d There was a misty brush against his naked shoulder. Dara\u2019s touch? \u201cBut Nefri has used his emotions to manipulate him into becoming our enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it took much manipulation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t believe that. You know Santiago,\u201d she whispered directly into his ear. \u201cNo matter what you\u2019ve done, if he\u2019s coerced into harming his sire he will be tortured by guilt. It will eventually destroy him.\u201d</p><p>Gaius tried to shut out her words.</p><p>The last time there was a whisper in his ear, the Dark Lord persuaded him to betray his son, his clan, and eventually the entire world.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t be fooled again.</p><p>But then he turned his head to catch sight of the delicate, honey-tinted face and his logic sizzled beneath the burst of intense yearning.</p><p>Once he\u2019d been happy.</p><p>Centuries ago he\u2019d been a powerful clan chief with a devoted mate and a fiercely loyal son he was training to follow in his footsteps.</p><p>He wanted that back.</p><p>He wanted it with a hunger that destroyed any lingering threads of sanity.</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d he at last rasped.</p><p>Dara smiled, pleased with his capitulation. \u201cWe must convince him that he\u2019s still our son and that all we want is to be a family again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe three of us together,\u201d she continued, weaving her web of temptation. \u201cJust imagine, habibi.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s too late? I cut all ties with Santiago when I abandoned him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never too late,\u201d she assured him. \u201cHe\u2019s following our trail even as we speak.\u201d</p><p>He gave a slow nod. \u201cThen, we can speak when he arrives. I can apologize and tell him how much I regret leaving him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, but first you must make him help us,\u201d Dara said impatiently, interrupting his fantasy of the long overdue reunion with Santiago.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked in confusion. \u201cHelp us with what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something that needs to be retrieved and he\u2019s the only one who can get his hands on\u201d\u2014there was a faint hesitation\u2014\u201cit.\u201d</p><p>Gaius flinched. \u201cWe can\u2019t ask him to help as soon as he arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You said yourself that he\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll assume that we just want to use him.\u201d</p><p>Dara studied him with an unblinking gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to wait. Unless you want to put me back in my grave, then we must force him to help.\u201d</p><p>Gaius shook his head. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she swiftly agreed. \u201cBut we\u2019ll need leverage.\u201d</p><p>He paused. Once upon a time he\u2019d been the master of strategy, the one who made the plans and was the driving force that made sure they were accomplished. Dara had always deferred to his stronger will, supporting him with her gentle belief he was always right. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Until that god-awful night when the neighboring vampire clan had come to seek vengeance.</p><p>Now . . . well, she\u2019d obviously changed.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of leverage?\u201d he found himself asking, accepting that for now Dara was in command.</p> <p>\u201cLet me consider.\u201d Her eyes grew distant again, as if she were seeing beyond the cellar. \u201cYes,\u201d she at last murmured.</p><p>\u201cDara?\u201d</p><p>The dark gaze locked on him, sending a chill down his spine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need your medallion.\u201d</p><p>Summerset House</p> <p>Nefri glared at the piles of expensive boxes with fancy bows and silver tissue that were spread across the room. She felt her annoyance rising as each box was opened to reveal yet another slinky gown or scraps of lace that Santiago assured her were negligees. Clothing that ranged from the impractical to the ludicrous.</p><p>Standing across the room, Santiago pulled another box from the stack that had been delivered as soon as the sun had set.</p><p>Tossing off the lid, he pulled out a skirt that was barely long enough to cover her butt and sparkling with silver sequins. \u201cWhat about this one?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed at the amusement shimmering in his dark eyes. The male was taking an inordinate amount of pleasure in displaying one worthless garment after another.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she ground out.</p><p>He reached for a tube of stretchy silk that she assumed was intended to be worn as a dress. \u201cThis one?\u201d</p> <p>She shoved her hands in the pockets of the robe she\u2019d found in the bathroom. Santiago was wearing a matching robe, although he\u2019d left it open to reveal the hard perfection of his bronzed body.</p><p>A body she now knew with a delectable intimacy.</p><p>A blissful shiver ran through her as her gaze slid over the lean, beautiful features that were framed by the hair that was left to fall in a smooth river of ebony over his shoulders and down his back.</p><p>His smile widened, revealing a hint of fang as the air became perfumed with her stirring arousal.</p><p>She gave an impatient click of her tongue. They\u2019d just spent the past ten hours sating their seemingly endless desire. How could she possibly be hungry for more?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re enjoying this,\u201d she muttered in a futile effort to distract herself from the thought of tumbling him onto the nearby bed.</p><p>He flashed his fangs, dangling a minuscule thong from his index finger. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying the thought of you wearing this.\u201d</p><p>Damn the gorgeous, utterly sexy vampire. How was she supposed to concentrate?</p> <p>Wrenching her mind away from tiny undies, half-naked males, and a bed that seemed to be calling her name, Nefri instead waved a disgusted hand toward the piles of discarded clothing. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with the females?\u201d she demanded. \u201cNone of these are sensible.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at the thong. \u201cPerhaps they assumed you would want to dress to please your man, not to be sensible.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cPlease my man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an unfamiliar phrase?\u201d</p><p>With a concentrated burst of her power, she had the thong lying in tatters at Santiago\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a stupid phrase.\u201d</p><p>Santiago tilted back his head to laugh with rich enjoyment. Then, stepping over the piles of boxes, he prowled forward. He halted directly in front of her, reaching to tug a strand of her hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just so easy, cara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d she warned, even as her lips twitched.</p><p>He smoothed the strand of hair behind her ear, his touch gentle but possessive. Something that should have set her teeth on edge, not make her treacherous heart warm with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the females were simply attempting to impress you with their exquisite taste and ability to offer the most expensive gowns,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d She wrinkled her nose, well aware she was overreacting. Unfortunately, the need to track down Gaius and whatever was controlling him was growing more urgent with every passing hour. It made her . . . tense. \u201cAnd I appreciate their gifts, but I have no use for any of it.\u201d</p><p>He glanced toward a red leather bustier that had come complete with a whip. \u201cNot even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSantiago.\u201d</p><p>With a soft chuckle he bent down to press his lips to her forehead. \u201cWhen will you learn you can depend on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepend on you for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d he assured her huskily before pulling back to regard her with a smug expression. \u201cBut in this particular case, I spoke with Gabriel last night and asked for him to find us suitable clothes to continue our journey.\u201d He reached to grab a plain bag from the end of the bed. \u201cTa da.\u201d</p><p>Reaching for the bag, Nefri pulled out several pairs of jeans, both male and female in various sizes, and two matching gray hoodies that would allow them to easily travel without attracting notice among the humans.</p><p>With a roll of her eyes, she tossed the clothes onto the mattress and stripped off her robe. \u201cSo all this was a waste of time?\u201d She waved toward the clothes scattered across the floor.</p><p>His dark gaze made a slow, intimate survey of her slender curves. \u201cHardly a waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are impossible,\u201d she muttered, pulling on the jeans and the smaller hoodie before shoving her feet into the sneakers she\u2019d been wearing when she arrived.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed\u201d, he readily agreed, his smile filled with a lethal charm as he dressed. \u201cBut what would you do without me?\u201d</p><p>She paused. Without him.</p><p>A hollow pain bloomed in the center of her very being. The sort of pain a vampire could die from.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to find out,\u201d she said, her voice so low she wasn\u2019t certain Santiago had heard her until he\u2019d grabbed her by the shoulders and pulled her hard against his chest.</p><p>He gazed down at her pale face, his expression somber. \u201cNefri . . .\u201d</p><p>Whatever he was about to say was interrupted by a sharp knock. For a minute, they stared at one another in silence, each unwilling to end the shockingly profound connection.</p><p>Then as there was another loud knock, Santiago was striding across the room, his curses filling the air. Yanking open the door, he glared at the handsome vampire who was attired in a gray tuxedo. \u201cDammit, Gabriel,\u201d he growled in obvious annoyance. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Unfazed by Santiago\u2019s harsh tone, or the icy power that slammed through the air, Gabriel straightened the cuffs of his white, satin shirt. \u201cThere\u2019s a\u201d\u2014he paused, a wicked amusement in his dark blue eyes\u2014\u201ccreature downstairs who says that he\u2019s your partner.\u201d</p><p>Santiago scowled. Partner? What the hell?</p><p>\u201cLevet,\u201d Nefri murmured, coming to stand at his side.</p><p>Oh . . . hell. He\u2019d forgotten the tiny gargoyle. Again. It had to be one of those Freudian things.</p><p>\u201cA curious companion,\u201d Gabriel said, clearly enjoying the thought of Santiago stuck with such a ridiculous creature.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d Santiago cautioned his host.</p><p>Gabriel smiled. \u201cHe claims to have vital information that you must hear immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Tell him to park his granite ass outside and we\u2019ll be down to speak with him later.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shifted his gaze to Nefri, reaching to lift her hand to his lips. \u201cMy lady, I hope my humble establishment has been . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Santiago wrapped an arm around Nefri\u2019s shoulder, firmly tugging her from Gabriel\u2019s light grasp. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSantiago,\u201d Nefri chided softly. She understood he was an alpha vampire who felt the need to flex his muscles when another alpha was near, but she wasn\u2019t a bone to be fought over. She had muscles of her own that could be flexed. \u201cThank you, Gabriel, for your most gracious hospitality.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel flashed Santiago a condescending smile. \u201cManners are a lost art among the children, I fear.\u201d</p><p>Santiago snorted, then deliberately slammed the door in Gabriel\u2019s face.</p><p>Nefri shook her head. Males. \u201cDo you feel better?\u201d</p><p>His arm tightened around her shoulder and without warning he was swooping down to kiss her with a fierce intensity. She stiffened in surprise, then, sensing his need, she melted against him. This wasn\u2019t about conquering her. Or even staking a claim.</p><p>It was an instinctive need to know she would willingly choose him above all others.</p><p>At last lifting his head, he regarded her with a brooding gaze. \u201cNow I feel better.\u201d</p><p>She went on her tiptoes to nip at his chin. \u201cWe need to find out what information Levet has.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I can convince you to let him wait a few hours?\u201d</p><p>She gave a shake of her head, that strange sense of urgency returning with a vengeance. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can afford to wait.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened, as if he shared her sudden unease. \u201cOh . . . hell.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Styx\u2019s lair in Chicago</p><p>To Sally the bedroom she\u2019d been given looked like something out of a glossy magazine.</p><p>As big as her mother\u2019s cottage, it was decorated in shades of sea foam green and silver. A massive fireplace consumed one wall with another wall lined with arched windows that overlooked a distant lake. The floor was covered by a Parisian carpet and the ceiling was covered with a painting of angels dancing among the clouds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the center of the room was a canopy bed with a pale green comforter that was perfectly matched to the chaise lounge set beside the windows. There was also a hand-carved armoire and a mirrored dressing table.</p><p>Clearly the gig of being the King of Vampires paid well, she wryly acknowledged, trying her best not to be intimidated by her surroundings.</p><p>It was bad enough that Roke had made her feel like the biggest loser to ever walk the earth.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly have been trapped with a worse mate if I tried. . . .\u201d</p><p>Cold-blooded snake.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to be overawed by a mere house.</p><p>Thankfully while she was indulging in a hot bubble bath someone (she was betting on Styx\u2019s lovely mate, Darcy) had made sure she had clean clothing. She chose a pair of black spandex pants that she matched with a white muscle shirt.</p><p>It was the perfect outfit for the hours of meditation she would need while her spell continued to simmer in the kitchen.</p> <p>Or at least, that had been the plan.</p><p>She\u2019d barely pulled on the clothes and run a brush through her damp hair when the silence was destroyed by a sudden knock. She stiffened, already knowing who was on the other side of the heavy walnut door.</p><p>She could actually feel Roke. As if there was a physical connection between them.</p><p>Standing in the center of the room, she wrapped her arms around her waist. It would be futile to try and pretend she was asleep. Roke was a vampire. He could no doubt hear the sudden increase of her heartbeat and the rapid rasp of her breath.</p><p>Besides, he\u2019d already proven he didn\u2019t give a crap about her or her feelings. Even if she was sleeping, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to wake her up.</p><p>While she dithered, there was another impatient bang on the door, and Roke\u2019s voice sliced through the air. \u201cOpen the door, Sally. I need to speak with you.\u201d</p> <p>Comforting her wounded pride with the lovely image of turning the creep into a slimy toad, she yanked open the door to glare at the unwelcome intruder. \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked in sweetly sick tones. \u201cDid you have a few more insults you wanted to share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I did\u2014\u201d His words broke off as his gaze took in her skimpy top and the clinging pants. The pale eyes darkened to smoke, his features sharpening with a hunger she didn\u2019t need their bond to sense.</p><p>His lengthening fangs would have been the first clue.</p><p>Sally blushed, feeling ridiculously exposed beneath that searing gaze. Stupid considering she\u2019d worn far less in public.</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d she prompted, clinging to the door and trying not to do her own share of staring. The arrogant vamp was well aware he was indecently gorgeous. He didn\u2019t need her drooling to stroke his ego.</p><p>He muttered something too low for her to catch before he was retreating behind his facade of stoic self-control.</p><p>\u201cI did some research on the warehouse,\u201d he finished, his voice smooth.</p><p>Sally eagerly latched on to the distraction. Anything not to have to deal with the renegade excitement that fluttered in the pit of her stomach.</p> <p>\u201cWhat warehouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one where the book was hidden.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, not sure where this was going. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t like mysteries.\u201d</p><p>Sally paused, knowing he wasn\u2019t being fully honest. There was some other reason for his sudden interest in the warehouse. Still, the sooner this conversation was over, the sooner he would leave. Why press for an answer he didn\u2019t want to give?</p><p>\u201cWhat does this have to do with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me in, Sally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>With exaggerated reluctance she stepped back, allowing him to enter the bedroom and close the door behind him. Moving past her, he glanced around the room, his gaze lingering on the large bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re comfortable?\u201d he abruptly demanded, acting almost awkward as he turned to study her heated cheeks. \u201cYou like the room?\u201d</p><p>Something dangerous tugged at her heart. Something she was quite ready to disguise behind a surge of annoyance. \u201cDon\u2019t try to be polite, Roke,\u201d she muttered. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened. \u201cDo you want an apology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say what you have to say and get out.\u201d</p><p>There was a tense silence, as if he were battling against some inner demon. Then with a shrug, he flipped open a manila folder he\u2019d been holding in his hand.</p><p>\u201cThe warehouse was previously owned by Lacombe Industries,\u201d he said, his voice carefully neutral. \u201cDo you recognize the name?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThe cosmetic company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He studied the file. \u201cThey were listed as an import-export firm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever heard of them.\u201d She stepped toward him without thought, her bare feet barely making a sound on the expensive carpet. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpike worked his magic on the computer and traced ownership of the company to a\u201d\u2014he flipped through a number of pages\u2014\u201cAnya Dubkova.\u201d</p><p>She gave a loud snort. \u201cA vampire named Spike? Is that a joke?\u201d</p><p>Roke shrugged. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to find it particularly funny, but the rest of us do.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cLeeches.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her brief interruption, he tapped a finger against the file. \u201cIs the name Anya familiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a powerful witch who was the head of the local coven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She felt a stab of relief. The last thing she wanted was to deal with the black magic. There was always a backlash. Not that she was going to admit her reluctance. She\u2019d learned a long time ago never to reveal a vulnerability. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his brows. \u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can get the witch who cast the spell it\u2019s much easier for her to remove it than for me to smash my way past it.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to be removing any spells.\u201d</p><p>Of course not. She swallowed a sigh. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and her entire coven were slaughtered almost thirty years ago.\u201d</p><p>Without warning he pulled out a glossy black and white photo that he shoved under her nose.</p><p>She blinked, plucking the photo from his fingers so she could focus on the image. Immediately she wished she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Her stomach revolted as she took in the sight of the bloody female bodies that were spread across a cement floor. The warehouse? It was impossible to know, and it didn\u2019t really matter. Not with the gruesome tumble of corpses that had clearly been savaged.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t an innocent.</p><p>She\u2019d been raised by a black witch and then eventually wound up in the service of the Dark Lord. She\u2019d witnessed things that still gave her nightmares.</p><p>But this . . .</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cThe massacre caused a panic at the time, according to the newspapers,\u201d Roke said. \u201cOf course, the local police didn\u2019t realize the twelve women were witches. They assumed that a serial killer had collected them together and then murdered them in one bloody spree.\u201d</p><p>Sally shook her head. \u201cNo serial killer could have done\u201d\u2014she shuddered, refusing to glance any closer at the mutilated bodies\u2014\u201cthis. Not to a coven of witches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could?\u201d</p><p>She shoved the picture back into his hand. \u201cIf they were caught off guard, then any number of powerful demons could have killed them.\u201d</p><p>She deliberately didn\u2019t use the word \u201cvampire,\u201d but his jaw tightened as he shoved the photo back into the file and pulled out a newspaper clipping.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a picture of Anya Dubkova before her death.\u201d He waited for her to take the clipping and study the picture of a middle-aged woman with silver hair pulled into a neat bun and a slender body attired in a business suit. She looked like a banker. \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen her?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>Sally lifted her gaze to regard him with a flare of impatience. \u201cDo you know every vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would you . . .\u201d She sucked in a sharp breath, startled by the realization that this man could still manage to wound her. You\u2019d think she\u2019d have developed a thicker skin. \u201cOh, I see. You assume that because she owned the warehouse where the book was hidden by black magic the witches must have been evil.\u201d She wrapped her arms around her waist. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m evil we must naturally be BFFs.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened at her accusation, but his expression remained unreadable. \u201cI\u2019m merely seeking information,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAnd there aren\u2019t so many covens that it would be a huge leap to think you might have crossed paths.\u201d</p><p>She allowed the clipping to flutter to the floor, turning to pace toward the windows. \u201cI avoided witches after my powers became more obvious. I couldn\u2019t risk them suspecting I had demon blood.\u201d She studied the night sky speckled with stars. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t kill me they would certainly have turned me over to my mother.\u201d</p><p>Roke made a low sound and she felt an elusive emotion surge through their bond. It was gone before she could pin it down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow can we find out more about this coven?\u201d he asked, his voice as cool and steady as ever.</p><p>With an effort, she forced herself to turn and meet his pale, guarded gaze. \u201cI doubt that we can.\u201d She hesitated. She\u2019d been taught from the cradle never to speak of the coven\u2019s private business. It wasn\u2019t a simple matter to overcome a lifetime of conditioning. \u201cWitches are by nature secretive and they would have made sure that their private records were protected by a nullifying spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA spell that would be activated by their death,\u201d she reluctantly explained. \u201cWhen they died their records, letters, and any personal information would have been destroyed.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, seemingly bothered by her words. \u201cExcept the book.\u201d</p><p>Oh. He was right. A book that was so dangerous it had to be hidden by black magic was precisely the sort of thing the witches would have made certain was destroyed rather than allowing it to fall into the hands of their enemies.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said with a slow nod.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>A good question. Perhaps even a dangerous question.</p><p>She chewed her bottom lip, unaware of Roke\u2019s covert fascination with the unconscious habit.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t know until I break the spell guarding it,\u201d she at last announced.</p><p>With a speed that was too swift for her to track, he was standing only inches away, his hands grasping her face so he could scowl down at her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d She told herself it was surprise at his abrupt approach that made her heart thunder in her chest and not the cool touch of his hands against her face. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018no\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going near that book until we find out more about what killed the coven,\u201d he growled. \u201cAnd why.\u201d</p><p>She stilled. \u201cYou think the two are connected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already determined that I don\u2019t believe in coincidences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen surely it\u2019s all the more important that we find out what\u2019s in the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The pale eyes shimmered silver in the muted light, a hint of fang showing. \u201cI don\u2019t care if I have to lock you back in the dungeon. You\u2019re not returning to that warehouse.\u201d</p><p>Summerset House</p><p>Santiago led Nefri down the back steps of the club, already sensing the vampires filling the public rooms. The word of Nefri\u2019s arrival had clearly spread like wildfire and every demon in the area was rushing to catch a glimpse of her.</p><p>Thankfully Gabriel had foreseen the impending crowd and had moved Levet to a secluded room beneath the garages with two armed guards outside to make sure of their privacy.</p> <p>Perhaps a bit of overkill, but Gabriel was notorious for his detailed attention to his guests\u2019 comfort, predicting their every need. Just as Santiago was renowned for providing his guests with every wicked pleasure they could desire.</p><p>Using a hidden tunnel to travel from the house to the garage, they took the staircase down to what once had been a human bomb shelter.</p><p>The small square of cement was hardly designed for comfort, but Santiago fully approved of the fact it was secure, with no opportunity for their conversation to be overheard.</p><p>Not only because they needed to discuss the next step in their hunt for Gaius, but because he didn\u2019t need his fellow vampires seeing him in the company of the stunted gargoyle who was impatiently pacing the floor when they entered the room.</p><p>\u201cAh, at last,\u201d the creature muttered, his tail twitching as he came to an abrupt halt. \u201cI have been waiting forever.\u201d</p><p>Santiago rolled his eyes, well aware that it had been less than a half an hour since Gabriel informed them that Levet had arrived at the club. Nefri, however, was swiftly moving forward to pat the tip of his wing.</p><p>\u201cForgive us, Levet.\u201d</p><p>The ugly little face lit with a sudden smile. \u201cHow can I stay angry? You are forgiven, ma belle.\u201d</p><p>Santiago noticed there was no mention of forgiveness for him.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Nefri smiled. \u201cDid you have a reunion with Yannah?\u201d</p><p>Levet heaved a tragic sigh. \u201cNon. She was . . . unavailable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Nefri gave the delicate wing another pat. \u201cJust be patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFah. I have been oh-so patient, but for what?\u201d Levet spread his arms. \u201cHeartache.\u201d</p><p>Santiago took an impatient step forward. He\u2019d been forced to let the ridiculous creature trail along, but he drew the line at discussing the gargoyle\u2019s love life. \u201cYou told Gabriel you had some vital information that couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d he said in sharp tones.</p><p>Expecting the usual raspberry or a rude finger gesture, Santiago found himself frowning when the gargoyle instead gave a somber nod of his head.</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>Okay. This couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShay contacted me.\u201d Levet tapped a claw to his temple, indicating his ability to speak mind to mind with the Chicago clan chief\u2019s mate. \u201cShe said that Viper was unable to reach you.\u201d</p><p>With a muffled curse, Santiago reached into the pocket of his jeans to pull out his cell phone, not at all surprised to discover the battery had been drained.</p><p>Sex with Nefri was not only the most explosive pleasure he\u2019d ever experienced, but it tended to create havoc with electronics. Oh, and created the most dazzling displays of color.</p><p>\u201cDios,\u201d he muttered, aggravated by his dangerous lapse. He should have checked his phone the minute he climbed out of bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a disturbance at your club.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. That was why Viper was trying to contact him? It didn\u2019t make sense. \u201cThere\u2019s always a disturbance at the club. Tonya can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually . . .\u201d Levet\u2019s wings drooped, a disturbing expression of sympathy on his ugly face.</p><p>Santiago shoved the phone back into his pocket, his muscles rigid with a sudden tension. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>He heard Nefri\u2019s soft exclamation of shock, but his focus never wavered from the small demon. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of your waiters called Viper and said that a vampire simply appeared out of thin air in the middle of your club.\u201d</p><p>He hissed. Only two vampires could appear out of thin air. And he\u2019d been in the constant presence of one of them.</p><p>Which left . . .</p><p>\u201cGaius,\u201d he growled. \u201cMierda.\u201d</p><p>Levet nodded. \u201cOui. He appeared and grabbed Tonya. Then\u201d\u2014he gave a helpless lift of his hands\u2014\u201cpoof. They were both gone.\u201d</p><p>Just for a second his savage burst of fury threatened to cloud his mind. Tonya in the hands of that demented freak? Perhaps even now chained to a wall while he tormented her?</p><p>The cement walls shuddered and the fluorescent lights shattered before Nefri laid a restraining hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSantiago,\u201d she murmured softly.</p><p>Leashing his powers with an effort, he met her sympathetic gaze. \u201cWhy?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>She continued to rub his arm in a soothing motion. Trying to tame the rabid beast?</p><p>\u201cWhy Tonya?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed.\u201d His fury remained, but Nefri\u2019s touch gave him the calm necessary to consider the situation with a much needed clarity. Tonya needed a swift rescue, not her employer ranting and raving. \u201cIt makes no sense. Why would he take such a risk to snatch an imp from my club?\u201d</p><p>Nefri nodded, easily following his logic. If Gaius was going to risk being captured, why choose Tonya?</p><p>\u201cDoes she have any special talents?\u201d Nefri asked.</p><p>Santiago shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s related to Troy, the pain-in-the-ass Prince of Imps, so she\u2019s capable of creating hexes powerful enough to ensnare even demons and, of course, she can create portals along with the usual imp talents.\u201d</p><p>Levet waddled forward. \u201cDoes she know secrets?\u201d He pointed a claw at Santiago. \u201cHave you been\u2014what do they say\u2014cooking the books?\u201d</p><p>Santiago glowered at the small demon. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Levet blinked. \u201cWe were guessing why she was kidnapped, were we not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t have any secrets,\u201d Santiago snapped. \u201cAt least none she shared with me. She\u2019s an organized, highly effective assistant who has the beauty of a siren and the soul of an accountant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trust her?\u201d Nefri carefully inquired.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he growled without hesitation, well aware of what she was implying. \u201cTonya would never betray me. I would stake my life on it.\u201d He gave a restless shrug. \u201cBesides, if she was working with Gaius why would he reveal their connection now? There\u2019s no benef it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but her expression remained troubled. \u201cHow long have you known one another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral decades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re\u201d\u2014she searched for the word she wanted\u2014\u201cclose?\u201d</p><p>He sent her a startled glance. \u201cWhat are you asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not behaving as a jealous lover, Santiago,\u201d she gently assured him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen what does it matter how long I\u2019ve known Tonya? I trust her\u2014\u201d His words came to an abrupt halt as he met Nefri\u2019s steady gaze. Dios. There was one reason someone would go to the effort of kidnapping Tonya. \u201cHe\u2019s using her to send a message to me,\u201d he said in rough tones.</p><p>\u201cThat would be my guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow the question is\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Nefri grimaced. \u201cWhat\u2019s the message?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Nefri grimly maintained her composure. Right now Santiago needed her calm, cool logic. Inside, however, she was battling a rising tide of fear.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why Gaius would have discovered a sudden interest in Santiago. Or more likely, the spirit that was controlling him.</p><p>But she did know that Santiago would do whatever was necessary to rescue the female imp. Including putting himself in danger.</p> <p>And there wasn\u2019t a damned thing she could do to stop him. \u201cIt could be that he discovered we\u2019re hunting him.\u201d Santiago spoke his thoughts out loud, his barely leased fury dropping the temperature in the tiny room to near zero. \u201cHe could be hoping to convince me to give up the search in exchange for Tonya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d she prompted, hearing the lack of conviction in his voice.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not Gaius\u2019s style.\u201d With a sharp movement he was pacing back and forth, his hand instinctively reaching to pull out the Roman dagger he kept tucked in his back pocket. \u201cHe can be a hammer when necessary, but he prefers to be subtle. He\u2019s a master of diversion.\u201d</p><p>Nefri grimaced. Gaius had certainly managed to deceive her. He\u2019d hidden his true intentions behind his genuine grief to gain access to her clan beyond the Veil.</p><p>A knowledge that still burned like acid against her pride. But she wasn\u2019t going to allow his abuse of her trust to blind her to facts.</p><p>\u201cYes, if he is actually still in the position to be master,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible he\u2019s no longer making the decisions.\u201d</p> <p>Santiago sent her a grim frown. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me feel better.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to.\u201d</p><p>He continued his pacing, his hands clenching and unclenching until he at last came to an abrupt halt directly in front of her. \u201cNefri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonya is family.\u201d</p><p>She reached to place a hand on his arm, able to sense his distress at Tonya\u2019s capture. It was far more than just the anger of an employer. Or a friend.</p><p>It was deeper. More personal.</p><p>\u201cYou rescued her,\u201d she said softly.</p> <p>He gave a low hiss of shock. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to suspect you truly can read minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I know you.\u201d Her fingers tightened on his arm. \u201cStyx pulled you from the blood pits and Viper gave you a home. They taught you honor and discipline and that a leader cares for those who are vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>He slid the dagger back into his pocket, his eyes dark with painful memories. \u201cIt\u2019s not my story to tell, but she ended up on the wrong side of an argument with a tribe of trolls and was sold to a slaver.\u201d</p><p>Levet gave a violent flutter of his wings. \u201cEvor?\u201d</p><p>The two males shared a rare moment of understanding. \u201cS\u00ed.\u201d</p><p>The tiny gargoyle trembled. Nefri had heard rumors that Levet had been held captive by the brutal slaver, along with Viper\u2019s mate, Shay.</p><p>\u201cA very bad man,\u201d Levet muttered.</p><p>\u201cVery bad,\u201d Santiago agreed. \u201cIf Tonya hadn\u2019t been so strong she would never have survived.\u201d His low growl trickled from his throat. \u201cNow she\u2019s being held against her will again. I can\u2019t leave her in the hands of Gaius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Nefri studied his stubborn expression with open concern. \u201cBut, Santiago\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a trap,\u201d he interrupted her cautious words. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaius will be waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes smoldered with a ruthless determination. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do to prevent that.\u201d</p><p>The fear that she was trying so desperately to control threatened to explode as she glared at him in helpless frustration. \u201cI\u2019m not going to change your mind, am I?\u201d</p><p>His touch was tender as he cupped her face in his hands, but he gave a firm shake of his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She met his gaze squarely, her centuries of experience allowing her to transform the fear into stark resolve. What made a clan chief a leader was their ability to control their emotions rather than be controlled by them. \u201cThere\u2019s no longer any need to try and sneak up on him.\u201d</p><p>Santiago\u2019s expression became guarded. \u201cYou have a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, but we might as well use my medallion to travel,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will save us time.\u201d</p><p>He was shaking his head before she even finished speaking. \u201cI can\u2019t pinpoint his exact location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll travel north until you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNefri . . .\u201d</p><p>She pressed her hand to his mouth, her eyes warning that she wasn\u2019t in the mood to listen to his endless list of reasons why she shouldn\u2019t join him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even bother.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened on her face. \u201cDammit, Nefri, we\u2019ve agreed this is a trap. It would be beyond stupid for both of us to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree of us,\u201d Levet abruptly intruded into the conversation.</p><p>Santiago\u2019s eyes widened in horror. \u201cOh, hell no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the three of us,\u201d Nefri said.</p><p>Dropping his hands, Santiago glared at her tranquil expression. \u201cIs this some sort of punishment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re partners.\u201d She stepped forward to place her lips against the stubborn line of his jaw. \u201cWhich means we stand together. Always.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, clearly torn between his instinctive need to protect her and the understanding that she was a powerful weapon that might very well make the difference between Tonya\u2019s rescue or her death at the hands of Gaius.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were a dangerous female.\u201d Pressing a resigned kiss to her forehead, Santiago headed for the door. \u201cI need to speak with Gabriel before we leave.\u201d</p><p>Gaius\u2019s lair in Wisconsin</p><p>With an appreciative eye Gaius studied the female imp chained to the wall of the cellar.</p><p>He\u2019d never been a lover of the fey, but there was no denying her emerald green eyes and tumble of flame curls could make any man want to spread her legs. Who wouldn\u2019t want to indulge in those lush, delectable curves barely covered by the strapless silver gown?</p><p>And then there was the warm scent of her blood. It was . . . intoxicating.</p><p>His fangs ached as he was struck by a sharp hunger. It had taken a considerable amount of energy to use his medallion to travel to Santiago\u2019s demon club and return with the imp. He needed to feed.</p><p>Unfortunately, he hadn\u2019t brought the female to his lair for a snack. Or even to pleasure him.</p><p>He needed her if he was going to persuade Santiago to accept his offer of reconciliation. And to convince him to assist him in protecting Dara.</p><p>Which meant no tasting the hostage.</p><p>At least not until she\u2019d served her purpose.</p><p>Strolling forward, he crouched down to meet her gaze, enjoying the scent of plums that was spiced with a combination of fear and fury.</p><p>\u201cYou really are remarkably beautiful,\u201d he murmured, his finger drifting over the dewy skin of her cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder Santiago kept you as a companion for so long.\u201d</p><p>She choked back a scream. \u201cI\u2019m his employee, not his companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than that.\u201d His finger shifted to linger on the pulse that hammered at the base of her throat. The moment he\u2019d appeared in Santiago\u2019s club he\u2019d been drawn to the female. \u201cIt\u2019s distant but I can sense his claim on you. He considers you a part of his clan.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, making a visible effort to calm her nerves. \u201cYou\u2019re mental. I\u2019m just a member of his staff.\u201d She futilely tried to arch away from his touch. \u201cSo if you\u2019re expecting to use me to get to him, then you\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d</p><p>Clever imp.</p><p>She had easily realized she was the bait and hoped to trick him into believing she had no value.</p><p>\u201cNo, he will come for you,\u201d Gaius said with an unshakable confidence. \u201cSantiago is at heart a savior.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned, but she didn\u2019t try to argue. \u201cWhat do you want with him?\u201d she instead demanded.</p><p>\u201cOnly for an opportunity to tell him how sorry I am.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed in disbelief. \u201cYou don\u2019t need me for that.\u201d</p><p>Gaius shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s too angry to listen to me unless I can force him to hear what I have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKidnapping me is only going to piss him off. It certainly won\u2019t put him in the mood to listen,\u201d she pointed out, shuddering as his fingers drifted to follow the line of her collarbone. \u201cOr to forgive.\u201d</p><p>Gaius frowned, his fingers moving to squeeze her throat. What did the bitch know? Santiago was his son. That was a bond that couldn\u2019t be broken. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe will listen,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. He\u2019ll listen,\u201d she croaked, sucking in a deep breath as his grip loosened. \u201cBut I\u2019m telling you he\u2019ll be a lot more forgiving if you release me.\u201d</p><p>His fury eased as he was distracted by the softness of her skin beneath his fingers and the scent of plums teasing his nose.</p> <p>\u201cClever and beautiful,\u201d he muttered, lowering his hand so he could cup the ripe temptation of her breast.</p><p>She made a sound of distress. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her reluctance only fueled his stab of lust. \u201cDoes my touch repulse you?\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make you like it.\u201d His grip tightened until she gave a small cry of pain. \u201cI can make you beg for it.\u201d</p> <p>The emerald eyes flashed with hatred. \u201cNot even in a million years,\u201d she spat out, her chin inching higher. \u201cI have royal blood flowing through my veins. I can\u2019t be enthralled, vamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyalty,\u201d he sneered. The imp thought she was above him with her noble blood? He\u2019d teach her just how worthless it was. \u201cSuch a proud imp.\u201d</p><p>He could hear the leap of her pulse as he allowed his powers to fill the cellar.</p><p>\u201cStop . . .\u201d Her magnificent eyes dilated with an uncontrollable lust. \u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, running his tongue up and down his sensitive fang.</p><p>Maybe a small taste wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p> <p>\u201cYes, my beauty?\u201d</p><p>A layer of sweat bloomed on her skin. \u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>He tugged at the hardened tip of her breast. \u201cDo you want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut even as her body trembled with need. \u201cYou\u2019re disgusting.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled with cruel amusement, ignoring his weakness as he deliberately altered his appearance. In the distance he could feel his approaching guests and he intended to reveal the full glory of his new powers.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps this shape will tempt you,\u201d he murmured, giving her nipple a more painful tug. \u201cOpen your eyes, Tonya.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly lifting her lashes, she gave a gasp of shock as she caught sight of his features, which were now an exact duplicate of Santiago.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she breathed, but Gaius didn\u2019t miss the increase in her pulse or the sudden shallowness to her breathing.</p> <p>Her arousal wasn\u2019t entirely due to the lust that pulsed through the air.</p><p>\u201cIs this better?\u201d He leaned down to savor the scent of her heated blood. \u201cAre you in love with your employer?\u201d</p><p>A low groan was wrenched from her throat as she arched toward him. \u201cPlease . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he urged.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she whispered, the chains rattling as she tried to reach for him. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at the sound of soft footsteps on the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou want Santiago?\u201d he cooed.</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d she moaned, panting with the desire that ran rampant through her blood. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He allowed his fangs to scrape down the curve of her throat. \u201cI told you I would make you beg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d a furious voice snapped from the doorway of the cellar. \u201cLeave her alone.\u201d</p><p>Gaius pulled back, but his gaze never strayed from the beautiful imp. It was unfortunate, but Santiago had to be reminded of Gaius\u2019s superior position. Even among family the hierarchy had to be established.</p><p>\u201cBut she is so happy to be with you,\u201d he murmured, turning her eager face so Santiago could see her pleading expression. \u201cShe\u2019s wanted you for a very long time, haven\u2019t you, imp?\u201d</p><p>Santiago took a step forward, his fury a tangible force that beat through the cellar. \u201cShe has no part in this. Just let her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt her,\u201d Gaius assured his companion. \u201cI only wanted your attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have it,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Straightening, Gaius allowed his shape to return to normal, a smile of warm greeting curving his lips.</p><p>First the stick and then the carrot.</p><p>It had always been his preferred style of leadership.</p><p>\u201cMy son.\u201d</p><p>Santiago grimaced, his attention shifting to the imp who curled her shivering body into a small ball on the floor.</p><p>\u201cLet me have Tonya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Gaius stepped forward to block the imp from Santiago\u2019s line of vision. \u201cFirst we talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll release her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>Gaius studied the vampire whom he\u2019d claimed as his son so many centuries ago. There were few changes. A vampire didn\u2019t age. But there was a hardness to the lean features that hadn\u2019t been there before Dara\u2019s death and a icy lack of pleasure in their long overdue reunion.</p><p>Stifling his stab of disappointment, Gaius glanced over Santiago\u2019s shoulder. He could feel a tiny demon just outside the door. A . . . gargoyle? A meaningless pest. He was far more interested in the thundering pulse of Nefri\u2019s power. His brows lifted as he realized she was moving away from the lair, not closer.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your companion going?\u201d</p><p>Santiago grimaced. \u201cShe had a small task to finish.\u201d</p><p>It took a second for Gaius to realize that his former chief wasn\u2019t alone as she moved through the woods that surrounded the house.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cThe humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNefri is surprisingly squeamish for a clan chief. She insisted that they be released.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bother, but they can be replaced,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou never kept a herd before,\u201d Santiago accused him, displaying his aversion for keeping a group of humans or lesser demons caged like animals. \u201cWhy now?\u201d</p><p>Gaius gave a restless shrug. This wasn\u2019t what he wanted to discuss. \u201cI must feed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the torture?\u201d the younger vampire pressed. \u201cDid you develop a taste for pain after you became a slave for the Dark Lord?\u201d</p><p>Gaius flinched, deeply bothered by his son\u2019s icy condemnation. \u201cNo,\u201d he protested, taking a step forward. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me.\u201d</p><p>Santiago stilled. \u201cThen who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDara.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Santiago narrowed his gaze.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Had Gaius gone bat-shit crazy?</p><p>It would, of course, explain his sire\u2019s shockingly filthy appearance and the strange glitter in his dark eyes.</p><p>But Dara? Cristo.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he at last managed to growl, shifting so he could catch a glimpse of Tonya as she shivered on the dirt floor.</p><p>She looked shaken, but unharmed. Not that the sight eased the fury that beat through his blood. Gaius was going to pay for every bruise on her delicate skin.</p><p>A demented joy twisted Gaius\u2019s bloodstained face, filling the air with a dangerous sense of euphoria. \u201cDara,\u201d the older vampire said in a reverent voice. \u201cShe\u2019s been returned to me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Bat-shit crazy.</p><p>Santiago might have felt pity for the pathetic bastard if he hadn\u2019t betrayed everyone who had ever trusted him. Oh, and was even now threatening to destroy the world.</p><p>As it was, all Santiago wanted to do was chop off his head and be done with the nasty business.</p><p>But not yet, a voice warned in the back of his mind.</p><p>Nefri had insisted they needed information. And for now, Gaius was the only one who could tell him what the hell was going on.</p><p>\u201cDara has returned from the grave?\u201d he repeated, making sure he hadn\u2019t misunderstood.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not possible.\u201d He searched Gaius\u2019s expression for some sign he was being controlled by another force. At the moment he couldn\u2019t sense anything but the vampire\u2019s seething madness. \u201cYou watched her burn.\u201d</p><p>Gaius pressed a hand to his unbeating heart. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires aren\u2019t capable of regenerating once they\u2019re dead. They don\u2019t even produce ghosts.\u201d</p><p>An abrupt anger tightened Gaius\u2019s gaunt face. \u201cI was promised this. She is my reward for my faithful service.\u201d</p><p>Santiago hissed in pain. Dara was a lovely, astonishingly gentle female who had blessed them all with her unwavering love. She wasn\u2019t a damned reward.</p><p>\u201cA reward from who?\u201d he forced himself to ask.</p><p>\u201cFrom the Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>Santiago shook his head. He\u2019d known that Gaius had betrayed them to the evil deity for the opportunity to be reunited with his dead mate. But he still didn\u2019t understand why.</p><p>\u201cI know you were grieving, Gaius, but you\u2019ve never been stupid,\u201d he managed to point out, his voice coated with ice, but his weapons still sheathed.

Santiago frowned. It wasn\u2019t the pervasive violence that had choked the air in Louisiana or even the fear around the schoolhouse where they\u2019d found poor Melinda. But it was without a doubt coming from Gaius.</p><p>A new talent like his shape-shifting? Or a warning that the strange spirit was working through him?</p><p>Instinctively he shifted closer to Tonya. If things went to hell he wanted to be near enough to make a grab for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to understand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was my fault.\u201d</p><p>Santiago frowned. \u201cWe all feel guilty for Dara\u2019s death. If I had been there then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gaius abruptly turned to face him, his eyes burning with a bleak regret. \u201cThe attack was my fault.\u201d</p><p>Santiago halted the denial on the tip of his tongue. Maybe this was more than the typical survivor guilt.</p><p>Maybe there was a deeper reason for Gaius\u2019s madness.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p> <p>Gaius turned his head, as if unable to meet Santiago\u2019s steady gaze. \u201cI had decided that our clan had grown powerful enough to expand our territory.\u201d He gave a short, humorless laugh. \u201cAfter all, why be content with Rome when I could rule the entire empire?\u201d</p><p>Santiago lifted his brows in surprise. \u201cAn ambitious plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I intended to begin small.\u201d He waved a dismissive hand. \u201cA simple takeover of the neighboring clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never said anything about expansion,\u201d Santiago accused him, belatedly accepting that he had never truly known this man. \u201cI thought I was your most trusted soldier.\u201d</p><p>Gaius turned back. \u201cYou were my son, not a soldier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t trust me with such vital information?\u201d</p><p>A hint of impatience rippled over Gaius\u2019s face. \u201cOnly because I hoped to achieve my goals without involving you or any other clan member.\u201d</p><p>Santiago shook his head in disbelief. \u201cYou expected the clan chief to hand over his territory if you asked nicely?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI expected a quiet dagger in the back to avoid a messy war.\u201d</p><p>Santiago curled his lip. Assassination. The coward\u2019s choice.</p><p>\u201cEt tu, Brute?\u201d he mocked.</p><p>Gaius waved aside his scorn. \u201cA bloodless . . .\u201d He grimaced. \u201cWell, an almost bloodless coup is always better than war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was to hold the dagger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI approached the neighboring chief \u2019s general,\u201d Gaius admitted. \u201cI had heard rumors the vampire lusted after the chief \u2019s mate. It was a simple matter to convince him that once his chief was dead he could have the mate in his bed. I gave him my weapon to perform the deed.\u201d</p><p>Santiago pulled the pugio from the pocket of his jeans and tossed it in the middle of the floor. The silver blade of the Roman dagger shimmered in the light from the bare bulb hanging from the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cThis weapon?\u201d</p><p>Gaius frowned, as if trying to figure out how Santiago had gotten his hands on the dagger.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed,\u201d he said in a clipped voice. \u201cEven though I wasn\u2019t going to be the one striking the killing blow, I wanted the clan to know who was behind the plot so they would bow to me.\u201d</p><p>Not only a coward, but a delusional coward.</p><p>Idiot.</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cYou trusted a vampire who would betray his own leader?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mistake.\u201d A surge of fury slammed into Santiago with enough force to send him reeling backward before it abruptly shifted to a vast, grinding sorrow. \u201cBut at the time I was blinded by my own arrogance. I was so certain I was stronger and smarter than any other vampire. I felt invincible.\u201d</p><p>Santiago heard Tonya\u2019s soft sobs even as he battled against the urge to fall to his knees beneath the weight of the choking sadness.</p><p>\u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d he asked between gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never know for certain.\u201d Gaius scrubbed his hand over his face, his shoulders bowed with a weariness he could no longer disguise. \u201cPerhaps the general lost his nerve and confessed his sins to his chief, or he was foolish enough to brag of his plans to a fellow clansman. But it was two nights later when we were attacked. Dara was burned, my clansmen slaughtered, and I found that\u201d\u2014he pointed toward the dagger lying on the floor\u2014\u201cstabbed into my pillow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you sold your soul to make up for your bungled attempt to become emperor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDara paid the cost of my conceit,\u201d Gaius said, a visible shudder wracking his thin body. \u201cI would have sold my soul a thousand times over to bring her back.\u201d</p><p>Santiago furrowed his brow, assuming the seeds of his sire\u2019s madness must have been planted in that moment. \u201cEven knowing it\u2019s a futile dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will admit that I began to fear that I\u2019d been taken for a fool. The Dark Lord\u201d\u2014he spit out the name of his former master\u2014\u201cproved to be a disappointment. Or so I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Santiago pressed. Not because he gave a damn. Gaius had proven over and over he was unworthy of Santiago\u2019s forgiveness. But he needed to understand how the vampire could have become infected by the dangerous spirit.</p><p>\u201cI awoke in the warehouse to discover that Dara was with me.\u201d</p><p>Santiago shook his head. He\u2019d been in the warehouse during the bloody battle with the Dark Lord. Even with all the chaos he would have known if Dara was near.</p><p>\u201cYou mean with you in spirit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . . she\u2019s here,\u201d Gaius insisted. \u201cIn this house.\u201d</p><p>Okay, enough. The vampire was either trying to trick him or so Froot Loops that he was imagining his deceased mate had been returned from the dead.</p><p>\u201cI searched the house before coming into the cellars,\u201d he said, his flat tones warning he wasn\u2019t in the mood to be jerked around. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here beyond the humans and Tonya.\u201d</p><p>Gaius hesitated, his eyes shifting toward the open door as he used his senses to search for his missing mate. \u201cShe must have . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The older vampire frowned in confusion before at last giving a shake of his head. \u201cShe must be hiding until we\u2019re certain that you can be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Santiago glared at the man who\u2019d caused so much pain. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who betrayed my people.\u201d</p><p>Gaius winced, holding out his hand in a silent plea. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a night that has passed that I haven\u2019t regretted leaving you behind, my son.\u201d</p><p>Using the legitimate excuse to shift away from the gesture of reconciliation, Santiago edged to the side. Still, Gaius remained poised between him and the silent Tonya. He needed to get closer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t,\u201d Gaius harshly interrupted him. \u201cDara has been returned. We\u2019ll be together as a family again.\u201d</p><p>Santiago swallowed a growl of impatience. Obviously his sire\u2019s insanity went beyond just thinking his mate was hiding nearby if he thought Santiago would ever consider him a part of his family.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you kidnapped Tonya?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Gaius glanced over his shoulder at the trembling imp. \u201cIn part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the other part?\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence before Gaius turned back. Almost as if he was debating how much to confess.</p><p>\u201cDara is in danger,\u201d he at last said.</p><p>Santiago didn\u2019t bother to try and argue that Dara couldn\u2019t possibly be in danger. He could only hope that they were at last getting to the point of Tonya\u2019s kidnapping.</p><p>\u201cIn danger from what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Oracles.\u201d</p><p>Santiago froze. Did Gaius simply sense that he was being hunted by the Commission? Or did someone\u2014or something\u2014whisper in his ear that the powerful Oracles were a danger to his dead mate?</p><p>He carefully considered his words. \u201cWhy would they be a threat to Dara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s not supposed to be here,\u201d Gaius whispered in low tones, acting as if he feared his words might be overheard. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>Santiago studied the vampire\u2019s gaunt face and the shadows beneath his eyes. Despite the blood staining his face that spoke of a recent frenzied feeding, he appeared like a man who\u2019d been starved for weeks, if not months.</p><p>There was more wrong with Gaius than his missing sanity.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>He again held out his hand. \u201cYour forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>Santiago deliberately folded his arms over his chest. Not even to gain information could he offer absolution.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kidnap Tonya for my forgiveness,\u201d he pointed out, his frigid voice making Gaius drop his hand in defeat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are my son,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIf you were so anxious for a reunion you would have contacted me when you first returned from behind the Veil,\u201d Santiago reminded his sire. \u201cNow tell me what you truly want.\u201d</p><p>Gaius hunched a shoulder. \u201cYou will learn to believe me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d Tired of the vampire\u2019s insistence on pretending he gave a damn about his one-time son, Santiago called his bluff. \u201cYou want my forgiveness, then release Tonya.\u201d</p><p>Predictably Gaius shook his head, his hands plucking at the cuff of his dark silk shirt. He didn\u2019t seem to notice the material was frayed and coated with dust. Yet another indication that the vampire was out of his mind.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must . . .\u201d Something moved in Gaius\u2019s dark eyes. Something immense and . . . aware. Like a great beast that was hidden in the shadows, just waiting to pounce. \u201cThere\u2019s a book.\u201d</p> <p>Santiago\u2019s muscles tensed, a sharp fear jolting through him.</p><p>Mierda.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t mistaken. There was something inside Gaius. Controlling him without the older vampire even being aware of the creature.</p><p>Was this the spirit that the Oracles were hunting? The supposed creator of vampires?</p><p>And if it was . . . what the hell was he supposed to do about it?</p><p>For the moment it obviously preferred to keep its presence hidden. And Santiago was happy to pretend he hadn\u2019t caught a glimpse of the terrifying creature.</p> <p>At least until he could determine exactly what it wanted with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat book?\u201d he asked, giving up any rash idea of trying to simply grab Tonya and flee.</p><p>At the moment, he wasn\u2019t sure any of them were going to get out of the cellar alive.</p><p>Or sane.</p><p>\u201cA spell book,\u201d Gaius said, a throb of frustration beginning to beat in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s being protected by black magic. We need to destroy it.\u201d</p><p>Santiago didn\u2019t have to pretend his confusion. This was why he was lured to Wisconsin? Because of a book?</p><p>\u201cI have no immunity to black magic,\u201d he said with a frown. \u201cNeither does Tonya.\u201d</p><p>There was another unnerving flicker of the spirit as Gaius tilted back his head, seeming to be spreading his powers far beyond the cramped cellar. \u201cThere\u2019s a witch,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Santiago struggled against an instinctive urge to reach for his sword. Cristo. His skin was suddenly crawling with the promise of pain. Like he was standing in the eye of a hurricane, just waiting for disaster.</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of witches,\u201d he pointed out. Carefully.</p><p>\u201cOnly one who can break the spell.\u201d</p><p>Santiago grimaced. Only one? So was that good news or bad?</p><p>Impossible to say.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the lair of the Anasso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Anasso?\u201d Santiago made a sound of disbelief. \u201cStyx is protecting a witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSally, Sally, Sally.\u201d Gaius slowly smiled, his eyes once again distant. \u201cShe thought she could double-cross me, stupid witch. But she\u2019s made it all so much easier.\u201d</p><p>Santiago lowered his brows, wondering if Gaius was referring to the witch who had once been his fellow servant of the Dark Lord.</p><p>She must have been desperate if she approached the King of Vampires.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand what you want from me.\u201d</p><p>Gaius studied him with growing impatience. \u201cI want you to get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Styx\u2019s lair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed.\u201d</p><p>Santiago paused, sending a covert glance toward Tonya, who had shifted as far as possible from Gaius, her arms wrapped around her drawn up knees.</p><p>A noose was tightening around his neck and he didn\u2019t have a damned clue how to escape.</p><p>\u201cWhy not you?\u201d</p><p>Gaius\u2019s mocking smile was so familiar that it caught Santiago off guard. Who was in control? Gaius or the spirit?</p><p>Or was it perhaps a strange combination of the two?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not precisely beloved among vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraitors are rarely beloved among any species,\u201d Santiago couldn\u2019t resist reminding him.</p><p>Gaius narrowed his gaze. \u201cSoon you will understand.\u201d</p><p>Santiago hissed at the sudden promise of violence that brushed over him. \u201cIs that a threat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would prefer not to use threats.\u201d Gaius reached down to pick up the forgotten dagger, his nonchalance not fooling Santiago for a minute. \u201cAll I need you to do is get the witch away from the Anasso\u2019s lair. A simple enough task.\u201d</p><p>Right. Sneaking into a lair with a higher grade security system than the Pentagon, not to mention a dozen of the most powerful demons on earth, to snatch a witch who was presumably hiding from the spirit. Yep. Simple as pie.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you use your . . .\u201d He shuddered, forced to recall the creepy sight of walking into the cellar to see himself bent over poor Tonya. \u201cTalent to shape-shift and just become me?\u201d</p><p>Gaius smoothly turned to throw the dagger at the doorjamb, proving that for all his fragile appearance he maintained his impressive strength as the blade sunk hilt deep into the wood.</p><p>\u201cStyx is already aware of my talent,\u201d he snarled. \u201cHe would realize the minute I appeared without your scent that it was me.\u201d</p><p>Santiago lowered his gaze to the gold amulet that hung around Gaius\u2019s neck. He could feel the noose tightening with every passing second.</p><p>He might not know why Gaius was so anxious to get his hands on this mysterious book, or why it had to be Sally the Witch to do the destroying, but he sure as hell knew it couldn\u2019t be for anything good.</p><p>Which meant he had to find a way to stop him.</p><p>\u201cThen why not use your medallion?\u201d he hedged. \u201cThat\u2019s how you captured Tonya, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The tightening of Gaius\u2019s lips proved the vampire had already tried to penetrate Styx\u2019s house. \u201cThe lair is protected by a spell that prevents portals from being created inside the house,\u201d he grudgingly admitted. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>With a regretful glance toward Tonya, Santiago squared his shoulders and spread his feet in preparation for battle.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Gaius frowned at the blunt refusal. \u201cMy son, don\u2019t be a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing foolish in loyalty. I will never betray my clan.\u201d</p><p>Gaius flinched, then the shame on his gaunt face was replaced by a cunning that sent a chill down Santiago\u2019s spine.</p><p>The creature was once again in control.</p><p>\u201cSo easy to say when there\u2019s no cost to that loyalty,\u201d he purred, lifting his hand as if pointing to something above them.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how deep your loyalty runs.\u201d</p><p>Santiago shifted backward, sensing a sudden flow of fury, although it seemed oddly muted. As if it was being funneled away from him.</p><p>Half expecting the ceiling to fall on his head, Santiago instead heard the front door to the lair being wrenched off its hinges followed by the unmistakable blast of Nefri\u2019s power.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSantiago!\u201d Levet called out in warning, then there was a thud, as if he\u2019d been tossed into the wall.</p><p>He had half a second to turn toward the door before Nefri was in the room, her hair floating around her exquisitely beautiful face and her eyes glowing with a mindless rage.</p><p>Her features had been sharpened, the alabaster skin so perfect it shimmered like the finest silk. And her slender body sculpted with the grace of an Amazon.</p><p>She was as nature intended.</p><p>An exotic symbol of pure female power.</p><p>Santiago stood in speechless wonderment. A mistake, as Nefri\u2019s fierce gaze shifted toward the female imp chained to the wall.</p><p>Tonya cried out in fear as Nefri flowed forward, her fangs fully extended and her hands curled into claws.</p><p>\u201cNefri.\u201d He was moving before he could consider the consequences, placing himself between Tonya and the feral vampire. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Nefri slammed into him with enough force to send him flying into the wall, his teeth rattling from the impact. He grimly ignored his cracked ribs and ice that was beginning to form on his skin as Nefri\u2019s fury blazed over him with frigid force.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop her. He\u2019d always known in a head to head battle her strength was greater.</p><p>But he could try to distract her from Tonya.</p><p>After that . . .</p><p>Hell, what did it matter? Chances were good he would be dead. He didn\u2019t really need a long-term plan.</p><p>With that cheerful thought at the forefront of his mind, he launched himself forward, wrapping his arms around Nefri as he struggled to contain her without causing her any injury. He felt her quiver, the sweet scent of jasmine filling his senses as if she were battling against the violence that thrummed through her veins.</p><p>But even as a tiny hope began to form, Nefri was wrapping her fingers around his throat and he was lifted off his feet. He grunted, refusing to reach for his weapons. He wouldn\u2019t harm her. No matter what the cost.</p><p>Instead, he gazed deep into her eyes, allowing her to see the love that was branded onto his very soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A love that he\u2019d never spoken, but had offered in every touch of his hand, in every lingering kiss.</p><p>He could only pray that she\u2019d been able to sense what he\u2019d been too cowardly to say.</p><p>Assuming the creature in control of Gaius was intent on enjoying his slow, painful death, Santiago found himself abruptly dropped as Nefri released her grip.</p> <p>Falling to his knees, he glanced up to discover that she was staring blankly at the far wall, clearly oblivious to her surroundings.</p><p>Then, Gaius stepped between them, staring down at Santiago with a cruel smile. \u201cI will release her on the world, Santiago,\u201d he purred. \u201cI will release her and the only way to halt her rampage will be to kill her.

Or the most gregarious.</p><p>He was, in fact, a taciturn vampire who was as willing to share his feelings as a rattlesnake.</p><p>Tonight, however, there was no doubt of his emotional state. As he paced the carpet of Styx\u2019s study, his moccasins made no sound, but the floor shuddered beneath his feet and the recently repaired chandelier swayed as his power sent tiny quakes through the air.</p><p>Leaning against the massive desk, Styx folded his arms over his chest, his expression one of exasperation. \u201cRoke, I understand your precaution, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roke interrupted, halting his pacing to glare at his king.</p><p>\u201cWhat if the book is important?\u201d</p><p>Still dressed in jeans, a T-shirt, and his leather jacket, Roke shoved a hand through his hair. He\u2019d almost ignored Styx\u2019s text that demanded his presence in the study. Unfortunately, it was difficult to ignore a royal summons.</p><p>\u201cThen it will still be important a month or even a century from now,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Styx muttered his opinion of pigheaded vampires before he pointed an accusing finger toward Roke. \u201cHas anyone told you that the art of negotiation consists of both sides being willing to compromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a negotiation.\u201d Roke allowed Styx to glimpse his unyielding resolve. \u201cSally isn\u2019t going anywhere near that warehouse until we discover why that coven was slaughtered. And who did it.\u201d</p> <p>They matched each other glare for glare, both too alpha to back down.</p><p>Then, with a shake of his head, Styx straightened from the desk. \u201cDammit. I\u2019ll have Jagr do some research,\u201d he snapped, his eyes narrowing in warning. \u201cYou need to concentrate on tracing Sally\u2019s family tree. The sooner you break the mating bond, the better.\u201d</p><p>Roke clenched his jaw, caught off guard by the raw stab of fury at Styx\u2019s callous words.</p><p>Magical trickery or not, the bond felt as real as any other mating.</p><p>Not that he was about to admit as much. To anyone. Instead he shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans. \u201cYou mean I\u2019m actually allowed to leave Chicago?\u201d</p><p>A punishing hint of pain crawled over his skin. A promise of what was possible if he truly pissed off his king.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been a prisoner, Roke,\u201d Styx said, arrogantly discounting his refusal to allow Roke to return to Nevada. \u201cBut why would you need to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I can hop on demon ancestry dot com,\u201d he pointed out dryly. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to pin down Sally\u2019s father, then I\u2019ll need to retrace her mother\u2019s footsteps.\u201d</p><p>Styx scowled, but having already commanded Roke to find a way to break the mating, he could hardly forbid him from taking the steps necessary to discover the source of Sally\u2019s demon blood.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you going alone,\u201d he at last muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Sally with me,\u201d Roke said, pretending the thought of having the exquisite little witch far away from the constant surveillance of Styx and his guards didn\u2019t send a flare of treacherous heat through his blood.</p><p>Who would ever know if he decided to steal a taste of her peach sweetness?</p><p>Dammit, no. She was off limits, he grimly reminded himself. Whether they were being watched or not.</p><p>The towering Aztec gave a shake of his head. \u201cNot good enough.\u201d</p><p>Roke made a sound of impatience. \u201cYou just said I wasn\u2019t a prisoner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to meddle among witches without protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStyx . . .\u201d</p><p>A shrill chirp interrupted Roke\u2019s protest and Styx offered a mocking grin as he reached for the cell phone on his desk and said, \u201cHold that thought.\u201d</p><p>Roke bared his fangs as Styx pressed the phone to his ear, but his seething frustration was forgotten as Styx hissed in shock, a blast of his frigid power nearly knocking Roke backward.</p><p>Shoving the phone into the front pocket of his leather pants, Styx was heading toward the door, a force of nature that could destroy everything and everyone in his path.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>Roke swiftly followed his king out of the study and down the hallway. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpike said that Santiago just arrived.\u201d</p><p>Roke lifted a surprised brow. The last they\u2019d heard, Santiago was hot on the trail of his former sire. \u201cHe has news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect it\u2019s more than that.\u201d</p><p>Styx\u2019s power was making the lights flicker and the priceless portraits tremble on the wall. Instinctively Roke reached to pull free the dagger he\u2019d tucked into the sheath hidden in his knee-high moccasin.</p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Spike told Santiago I was in my study, Santiago said that he was here on an errand from an old friend from Rome,\u201d Styx explained.</p><p>Roke frowned. \u201cDoes that mean something to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaius.\u201d</p><p>Roke instantly understood Styx\u2019s concern. Was Santiago sending a warning or a threat?</p><p>In either case, they needed to be prepared for the worst.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>The vampire pulled out the massive sword strapped to his back. \u201cFind Jagr and tell him to start a search of the grounds.\u201d</p><p>They had reached the stairs when Roke grasped his companion\u2019s shoulder and pulled him to a halt. \u201cStyx.\u201d</p><p>The Anasso sent him a frown of impatience. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Santiago is a trusted brother, but Gaius is his sire,\u201d he reminded his king. In the heat of the moment it was too easy to overlook the obvious. \u201cThat\u2019s a bond not easily broken.\u201d</p><p>Styx\u2019s expression was as hard as granite. \u201cI don\u2019t question Santiago\u2019s loyalty, but I\u2019m not blind to the fact a vampire can be torn by a competing allegiance.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cEither to Gaius, or to Tonya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe imp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been a part of his family for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you realize that you shouldn\u2019t face Santiago alone.\u201d</p><p>Styx grunted as he was neatly cornered by his own admission that Santiago might prove to be a danger. \u201cCristo,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>Pulling out his cell phone, Roke hit Jagr\u2019s number and concisely revealed what was happening with Santiago\u2019s arrival and Styx\u2019s order to start a search of the grounds.</p><p>The Anasso gave a rueful shake of his head before turning to jog up the stairs. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>Roke was swiftly at his side, baffled as he realized they were headed toward the private wing of the house. \u201cThe bedrooms? What could he . . .\u201d With a startled hiss, he came to a halt on the landing.</p><p>\u201cRoke?\u201d</p><p>Roke ignored his impatient companion, his hand lifting to press to his unbeating heart.</p><p>There was a tight ball of . . . what? Fear? Anger? Pain?</p><p>Actually it felt like a strange combination of all three.</p><p>He rubbed the spot in the center of his chest, baffled by the unfamiliar sensation. The feelings were inside him, but they weren\u2019t his.</p><p>Insanity.</p><p>No, wait.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t insanity.</p><p>It was . . .</p><p>\u201cSally,\u201d he growled.</p><p>His muscles suddenly clenched, a fear that was all his own catapulting him into action.</p><p>He moved down the hallway with a fluid speed, absently sensing Styx keeping pace while his concentration was entirely focused on his connection to his mate.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Roke,\u201d Styx commanded.</p><p>\u201cSally\u2019s in danger.\u201d He reached the door to her private rooms and threw it open. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Even prepared, the empty room hit Roke like a blow to the gut. Charging over the threshold, he released his hunter instincts, discovering the scent of a male vampire combined with the rich smell of peaches.</p><p>His mind clouded with pure possessive anger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A male had forced his way into Sally\u2019s room. He\u2019d put his hands on her. And then, he had the balls to try and take her away.</p><p>Roke would see him in hell first.</p><p>Headed toward the open window, he was momentarily distracted by the faint scent of blood. Lowering himself to his knees, he discovered a small red stain on the carpet.</p> <p>The ceiling cracked and the drywall crumbled as his fury went nuclear.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit,\u201d he snarled. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>Wise enough not to startle a vampire on the edge of murder, Styx cautiously hunkered down beside him, his voice soothing. \u201cRoke, it\u2019s only a drop. She\u2019s not badly hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>Styx grimaced. \u201cWhy the hell would he take her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI intend to find out,\u201d Roke muttered, shoving himself upright and through the window in one smooth motion.</p><p>Behind him Styx blistered the air with curses, but Roke never slowed as he hit the ground and followed the scent of peaches through the moonlight that spilled over the manicured parkland.</p><p>Reaching the back gate, he caught the smell of yet another male vampire. This one laced with an unmistakable rot of madness.</p><p>Gaius?</p><p>Not that he gave a shit.</p><p>The need to rescue Sally was thundering through his veins, leaving no room for logical thought or strategies.</p> <p>But as he stepped through the open gate, he was forced to an enraged halt.</p><p>The trail ended.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>There one step and gone the next.</p><p>He tilted back his head to roar with a savage frustration, indifferent to the scamper of terrified wildlife that darted into the nearby woods.</p><p>The sound was still echoing through the trees when Jagr and two of his Ravens appeared from around the corner of the high fence.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Roke demanded.</p><p>Looking every inch the Visigoth chief, Jagr clutched a sword in one hand and a pistol in the other. Not that either was as dangerous as the lethal fangs that were primed for maximum damage.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The ice blue gaze continued to scan the woods that provided privacy for Styx\u2019s lair from his distant neighbors. \u201cI caught a glimpse of him going through the back gate, but before I could get here he\u2019d disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSally?\u201d he managed to rasp between clenched teeth.</p><p>Jagr dipped his head. \u201cThe witch was with him.\u201d</p><p>Styx stepped through the gate, studying the tracks that halted directly in front of them. \u201cGaius must have used his medallion,\u201d he said before turning his attention to Roke. \u201cCan you sense Sally?\u201d</p><p>Struggling against his primitive instincts that rebelled at wasting even a second, Roke forced himself to close his eyes and concentrate on his mating bond. It was there. Oddly . . . muffled. As if something was trying to mask her presence from him. But there was no mistaking his sense of her just a few miles north of them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s muted, but she\u2019s not far,\u201d he said, opening his eyes to watch Jagr and Styx exchange a startled glance.</p><p>\u201cIs the medallion limited in how far it can carry more than one person?\u201d the large Visigoth asked.</p><p>Styx shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2014\u201d Jagr bit off his words as there was an unmistakable shift in the air pressure before the scent of granite filled the air. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>The male vampires turned, their expressions varying from resignation to outright disgust as Levet seemed to step from thin air, closely followed by Yannah.</p><p>Either unaware, or just indifferent, to his frigid reception, the tiny gargoyle gave a violent flutter of his wings, his tail standing at stiff attention.</p><p>\u201cMon dieu\u201d, he breathed, clearly frazzled. \u201cI hate traveling that way.\u201d</p><p>With a superior smile that all females perfected before leaving the cradle, Yannah smoothed the sleeve of her long white robe. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA baby?\u201d Levet puffed out his chest, looking more like a bantam chicken than a fearsome gargoyle. \u201cWhy I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevet, is there a purpose for your unexpected visit?\u201d Styx said as he sternly broke into the brewing squabble.</p><p>Levet immediately forgot his grievances and waddled toward the King of Vampires, his expression troubled. \u201cNefri.\u201d</p><p>There was a collective mutter of unease as Styx glared down at the gargoyle.</p><p>The mystique of Nefri was great enough that the mere thought that she was anything less than impervious to danger was . . . troublesome.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d Styx demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhen Gaius kidnapped Tonya she knew that Gaius was plotting to use Santiago.\u201d</p><p>Styx grimaced. \u201cAnd she was right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d Levet hunched his shoulders, his ugly features scrunched in distress. \u201cWe traveled to Gaius\u2019s lair and Nefri asked me to stay hidden so I would know what was occurring. She wanted to make sure I could go for help in the event that things went . . .\u201d He waved his hands as words failed him.</p><p>\u201cTo hell?\u201d Styx offered.</p><p>The gargoyle nodded. \u201cTo hell.\u201d</p><p>Clever of Nefri to make certain they could be warned, Roke silently acknowledged, but his shattering need to return to his hunt for Sally made him growl deep in his throat. Only the thought that the gargoyle might have some necessary clue to his mate\u2019s rescue kept him from charging through the darkness alone.</p><p>As if sensing his burning frustration, Styx reached to place a hand on his shoulder even as his gaze remained trained on the tiny demon. \u201cWhat does Gaius want with Santiago?\u201d</p><p>Levet wrinkled his snout. \u201cHe pretended he desired a reconciliation, but all he truly desired was for Santiago to sneak into your lair for the witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSally?\u201d Roke stepped forward, his fierce intensity making Levet take a hasty step backward and Yannah move to the gargoyle\u2019s side as if to offer her protection. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the only one who can destroy some spell around a book,\u201d he hurriedly admitted, his hands rising in a gesture of peace. \u201cI do not know any more, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it could be the same book?\u201d Styx muttered in astonishment.</p><p>Roke wasn\u2019t listening.</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe in coincidences.</p><p>Which meant he knew exactly where to find his missing witch.</p><p>The warehouse.</p><p>The warehouse north of Chicago</p><p>Over the years Sally had devoted a ridiculous amount of energy to avoiding a gruesome death.</p><p>Ever since her sweet sixteenth birthday it didn\u2019t matter where she went or how quietly she tried to live, there was always someone or something that wanted her dead.</p><p>So she wasn\u2019t sure why she felt so betrayed to find herself being kidnapped by a strange vampire and taken to Gaius, who was clearly even more demented than the last time she\u2019d caught sight of him.</p><p>Surely the only surprise should have been if she hadn\u2019t been betrayed?</p><p>Still, she found herself glaring at the handsome vampire with the beauty of a Spanish conquistador and the aloof, stunningly beautiful vampire who stood in the corner like a freaking ice princess. As if she could make them feel guilty.</p><p>Yeah, and she was destined to win the lottery.</p><p>With a shake of her head, she turned her attention to her surroundings, feeling a stab of confusion as she realized they were in the same warehouse where Roke had taken her.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Somehow she\u2019d assumed when Gaius had used his medallion to take them away from Styx\u2019s lair they would end up more than a few miles from the dangerous Anasso.</p><p>But then again, maybe he wanted her close. Didn\u2019t the ancient generals stick the heads of their hostages on a pike as a warning to their enemies? Gaius would want her mutilated body close enough so it couldn\u2019t be missed.</p><p>Wrapping her arms around her body, she at last turned to confront the vampire who had so briefly been her commander.</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>Holy crap.</p><p>She\u2019d wished bad things on Gaius. She might even have said a prayer or two that the arrogant SOB wouldn\u2019t survive the battle with the Dark Lord. But allowing her stunned gaze to drift down his gaunt frame covered with clothes a zombie wouldn\u2019t be seen dead in (yeah, really bad pun) and his eyes glowing with a hectic light, she had to admit that he looked like he\u2019d been through worse than even she had hoped for.</p><p>He looked . . . pathetic.</p><p>Of course, she wasn\u2019t stupid. Even pathetic and batty as hell, he was a lethal predator.</p><p>One who could kill her with one strike of his massive fangs.</p><p>Licking her dry lips, she considered a number of spells she could lob at the vampire, only to discard them. Most of them were ineffective against the walking dead. Besides, she needed to conserve her strength until her enemy was distracted.</p><p>That way she could potentially use her powers to escape.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a go-down-in-a-blaze-of-glory kind of gal. She preferred a run-like-hell-and-live-to-f ight-another-day philosophy.</p><p>Keeping that thought firmly in mind, she held herself perfectly still as Gaius prowled forward, slowly circling her as if he\u2019d never seen her before.</p><p>\u201cHello, Gaius. Long time no see,\u201d she said as she at last broke the thick silence, as always her nerves making her babble like an idiot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He came to a halt directly in front of her, his eyes glowing with an odd radiance. \u201cWitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you a thousand times, it\u2019s Sally,\u201d she snapped before she could halt the impulsive words. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard to remember.\u201d</p><p>The vampire shrugged. \u201cYour name doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>Sally sucked in a deep breath, ignoring the heavy scent of vampires that filled the musky air. Wasn\u2019t there some sort of saying about catching more flies with honey than vinegar?</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose it does,\u201d she muttered, pinning a stiff smile to her lips. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, okay? I shouldn\u2019t have gone to Styx, but I\u201d\u2014her smile widened as she was struck by inspiration\u2014\u201cI was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>The lean face remained devoid of expression, but the glow in his eyes flared with something that looked like hunger. \u201cHow very extraordinary that you should be acquainted with my host,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHost?\u201d She wrapped her arms around her waist as a shiver shook her body. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He acted as if he didn\u2019t hear her, the unnerving gaze sliding over her pale face. \u201cPerhaps it was merely fate ensuring that you would be available when I needed you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou . . . need me?\u201d With a frown she glanced toward the male vampire who was hovering near the motionless female, pretending he wasn\u2019t listening to the conversation although his tension was a palpable force in the air. He didn\u2019t behave like an eager accomplice, not even when he\u2019d kidnapped her from her bedroom, but it could all be an act. For now she had to assume he was one of the enemy. At last she glanced back to Gaius. \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring me here to punish me?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head to the side in a distinctly un-Gaius-like motion. \u201cPunish you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor going to Styx.\u201d</p><p>A smile that was more terrifying than reassuring curled his lips. \u201cYou aren\u2019t here for punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>She shifted beneath the glowing gaze, feeling as if he were rummaging around inside her.</p><p>Even worse, she was beginning to suspect that the glow in his eyes was more than just madness or the compulsion she\u2019d first assumed. He looked . . . possessed. As if he had been taken over by another creature.</p><p>It was freaking creepy.</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Gaius (or whoever the heck he was now) turned to point at the hole that Roke had punched into the wall. \u201cBecause of that.\u201d</p><p>Sally was briefly disoriented, as much from the sudden realization that she could actually sense Roke through their bond despite the distance (if she hadn\u2019t been neck deep in trouble she might have wondered what was causing his frantic desperation). As from the struggle to accept that Gaius had some other reason for kidnapping her than mere retribution for tattling on him to Styx.</p><p>\u201cThe safe?\u201d she asked in confusion; then she gave a sudden blink. \u201cNo. The book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated, hoping her sluggish mind would catch up with the rapidly shifting situation. \u201cYou want me to break the spell?\u201d</p><p>Gaius made a sound of disgust. As if she was unbearably stupid.</p><p>He\u2019d get no argument from her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one way to break the spell and destroy the book.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cOnly one?\u201d</p><p>Gaius nodded. \u201cYou die.\u201d</p><p>The words were said with such indifference that it took a second for Sally to react.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She took a stumbling step backward, wondering if this was some hideous nightmare. \u201cNo, I have the counterspell brewing at Styx\u2019s lair.\u201d</p><p>Gaius waved a hand. \u201cA worthless concoction.\u201d</p><p>She pressed a hand to her racing heart, trying desperately to hold back her panic. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d she forced herself to ask. \u201cI can promise you that my brews are more potent than most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no counterspell because it\u2019s sorcery.\u201d</p><p>Sorcery? She shook her head.</p><p>There were all types of magic.</p><p>Spells conjured by witches and wizards, both white and black. Demon magic that called on their natural powers. And the gifts of magic that were bestowed to prophets and other individuals blessed by fate.</p><p>Or cursed.</p><p>But sorcery was supposed to be an ancient magic that came from a place deeper than spells brewed in a cauldron or even the bloody altars.</p><p>It came from the very soul, devouring a piece of a witch\u2019s life force with every use.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI thought it was an urban legend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo legend, although from what I\u2019ve discovered of this world, the magic is not nearly as potent as it used to be,\u201d the creature that used to be Gaius murmured. \u201cStill once the spell is cast it\u2019s unbreakable until the last witch is dead.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth went dry. He spoke with an unshakable confidence. Right or wrong, he truly believed the book was protected by sorcery.</p><p>And that her death was the only thing that could give him what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t cast the spell,\u201d she managed to croak.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d A hint of impatience twisted the gaunt features. \u201cIt was cast at the beginning of time. When witches were in the power of the Oracles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitches in the power of the Oracles?\u201d She made a sound of shock. She\u2019d always been taught that witches had been created out of a human need to balance the growing power of demons and their Commission. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>Gaius shrugged. \u201cBefore the great schism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe great . . .\u201d She abruptly pressed her fingers to her throbbing temples. \u201cNever mind. I still don\u2019t understand what this has to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the truly powerful witches soul-bindings can be transferred from mother to daughter.\u201d His glowing gaze flicked over her slender body, which felt far too exposed by the skimpy muscle shirt and stretchy pants. \u201cAn unbreakable chain.\u201d</p><p>She forgot how to breathe as she accepted the only logical conclusion to his explanation.</p><p>\u201cSo my mother . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was one of the heirs.\u201d</p><p>A shrill, humorless laugh was wrung from her throat. She\u2019d never been truly satisfied with her mother\u2019s claim that she\u2019d chosen to have a daughter to ensure her power base. After all, there was no guarantee that Sally would be born with enough magical abilities to be more than a drain on her resources. It was far more practical to take on an apprentice who was old enough to display the level of her talent and yet young enough to be molded into a loyal acolyte.</p><p>Now she understood.</p><p>Her mother needed a blood heir to pass on her duty.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder she was so anxious to have a daughter,\u201d she muttered, wryly wondering when her mother had intended to tell her the truth.</p><p>Perhaps on that memorable sixteenth birthday?</p><p>What a grand irony that would be.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gaius agreed.</p><p>\u201cHow many heirs are there?\u201d</p><p>Gaius turned toward the gaping hole in the wall, his hatred toward the book pulsing through the air. Sally shivered, taking the opportunity to sneak a quick peek at the two silent vampires standing across the room.</p><p>The female remained impervious to her surroundings, but the male met her glance with a small nod of his head toward the door.</p><p>She frowned. What the hell did that mean?</p><p>That she was supposed to make a run for it?</p><p>That there were more enemies hidden outside?</p><p>That . . .</p><p>Her desperate thoughts were interrupted as Gaius abruptly turned back toward her.</p><p>\u201cThey began with thirteen,\u201d he said as he answered her question. \u201cThe numbers varied over the centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kept track of them?\u201d</p><p>He smiled with a cruel pleasure. \u201cMost of them were kind enough to remain together in the same coven, so when the Dark Lord began to thin the barriers between dimensions I was able to nudge my children into getting rid of them.\u201d</p><p>She knew. The minute he spoke the words she knew that he meant the coven that she\u2019d seen so gruesomely murdered in the photo.</p><p>And he spoke of the massacre as if they were mere bugs being squashed.</p><p>Blessed goddess.</p><p>Her hand shifted to press against her stomach, trying to stifle the churning nausea.</p><p>\u201cThey were slaughtered,\u201d she said in a raw voice.</p><p>The . . . Gaius-creature shook his head. \u201cAll but one.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the lump in her throat. \u201cMy mother.\u201d</p><p>The strange glow in his eyes flared, but prepared for his anger, Sally was rattled when instead it was her own simmering anger and fear that was stoked higher.</p><p>As if Gaius was capable of draining the emotions from her.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have known she had left the coven,\u201d he complained. \u201cBut when the spell remained intact I realized there must be one left.\u201d</p><p>She quivered, trying to regain control of her emotions. Now, more than ever, she needed a clear mind.</p><p>\u201cTwo left,\u201d she absently corrected.</p><p>That horrifying smile returned. \u201cNo. Only one. Now.\u201d</p><p>Profound shock gripped her, crushing any grief she might have felt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She simply couldn\u2019t accept a world without the woman who had given birth to her.</p><p>\u201cYou killed my mother?\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cGaius was kind enough to perform the deed on our way to his lair in Louisiana,\u201d the creature murmured, speaking of Gaius as if he were a separate being.</p> <p>She shook her head.</p><p>Dead.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Gaius dismissed her distress with a wave of his hand. \u201cOnce again I was to be disappointed, but I was growing stronger every day. So long as the book remained hidden it couldn\u2019t do any harm.\u201d Gaius reached over to trail an icy finger down her cheek, tracing the path of her unconscious tears. \u201cBut then it called you here.\u201d</p><p>With a shudder of revulsion she took a hasty step backward, forcing her fogged mind to concentrate on the danger standing directly in front of her.</p> <p>She would work through her grief and regret for her mother if she managed to survive the night.</p><p>Something that was looking increasingly unlikely.</p><p>\u201cCalled me?\u201d she shook her head. \u201cNo, I came because I wanted Gaius out of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been that, it would have drawn you here by some other means,\u201d he assured her. \u201cIt felt my presence. It would have done whatever was necessary to get into your hands.\u201d</p><p>She glanced toward the hole in the wall where she could feel the steady pulse of the black spell.</p><p>A spell that had caused the death of thirteen witches, including her mother. And was now her supposed legacy.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She turned back to the creepy, glowing eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he countered, clearly unwilling to reveal the truth of the book. \u201cOnce you\u2019re dead the book will be destroyed once and for all.\u201d</p><p>Sally braced herself, muttering an attack spell beneath her breath. She didn\u2019t believe it would actually damage the vampire, or whatever the hell was controlling him, but it was all she had.</p><p>Then, even as she felt a massive power beginning to build in the room, Gaius was suddenly turning toward the door, his hiss of annoyance scraping over Sally\u2019s raw nerves.</p><p>\u201cI warned you, Santiago,\u201d he growled, seeming to forget Sally. \u201cNow Nefri will pay for your arrogance.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>Santiago didn\u2019t do helpless.</p><p>After he\u2019d been pulled out of the Gladiator pits beneath Barcelona, he\u2019d sworn that he\u2019d never again be in a position where he was at the mercy of another.</p> <p>A mistake, of course.</p><p>He should have known that the minute he\u2019d made that bitter pledge, it would curse him. Life was nothing if not perverse, and what could be more destined to force him to face his worst nightmare than declaring it could never happen again?</p><p>Now he stood next to Nefri, his muscles quivering as he battled his urge to charge across the floor of the warehouse and rip off Gaius\u2019s head.</p><p>He told himself he was biding his time.</p><p>That was why he\u2019d agreed to kidnap the witch despite his grand pronouncement he would never, ever betray his brothers. And why he was standing here like a damned mannequin while the bastard revealed the truth of his reason for traveling to the warehouse.</p><p>He\u2019d left his clue with Styx on the off-chance that the Anasso would be able to track them. And then positioned himself so he would be able to grab Nefri and escape if the opportunity presented itself.</p><p>Tonya, after all, had been left behind in Wisconsin and by now should have been able to create a portal to take her back to his club. So all he had to worry about was the female standing like a statue beside him.</p><p>But, while he could pretend he had some sort of control over the situation, the moment Gaius glanced in their direction he knew it was an empty lie.</p><p>He\u2019d become a helpless pawn who had not only used his connection to the Anasso to kidnap an innocent young female, but he\u2019d led his brothers to this warehouse all because he was willing to sacrifice everything and everyone to protect Nefri.</p><p>And now . . .</p><p>Now he could sense Styx and at least four other vampires approaching the warehouse and Nefri\u2019s power beginning to swell in an awful tidal wave of looming destruction.</p><p>Rock, meet hard place, a voice mocked in the back of his mind.</p><p>For all his efforts he\u2019d done nothing more than make matters worse.</p><p>So what the hell was he going to do now?</p><p>Styx and his vampires would be breaking through the door in less than a heartbeat. At the same time Gaius would send Nefri into a mindless bloodlust. The battle between the vampires would be epic and violent and lethal.</p><p>Which meant that he had less than a nano-second to choose between two very bad, very awful decisions.</p><p>He picked the very awful one.</p><p>And more importantly, the one that Gaius would never have prepared for.</p><p>Not giving himself time to think, he reached down to snatch a stray piece of rebar off the floor. Then, as Nefri trembled beneath the surge of bloodlust, he stepped behind her and with one smooth motion he slammed the bar against the back of her head to send her crumpling to the ground.</p><p>The blow was hard enough to knock her out, but not hard enough to cause permanent damage. Which meant he would only have a few minutes to come up with a better plan before she was awake and on the rampage.</p><p>Using the fury that boiled through him at being forced to hurt the female he loved, Santiago turned and charged Gaius. With a roar, he pinned the vampire to the wall by the simple process of shoving the rebar through his heart and into the brick wall. Then with a twist he bent the rebar so it would be damned painful for Gaius to pull his way free.</p><p>Without missing a beat, he\u2019d raced to slam shut the steel door that was the only entrance into the room beyond the windows covered by thick boards. Then, grabbing the handle, he yanked it upward, feeling the lock twist until it was jammed.</p><p>Only then did he spin on his heel to return and glare at the creature who\u2019d caused nothing but pain and misery since its arrival in this world.</p><p>Pinned against the wall, the . . . thing seemed impervious to the rebar that was stuck through his heart, his eyes glowing with a hectic light even as the sluggish blood dripped from the hole in his chest.</p><p>But Santiago didn\u2019t miss the grayish hue of his skin and the way his clothes hung on his limp frame, almost as if he were shrinking with every passing second.</p><p>\u201cBrutal, yet efficient. You make me proud,\u201d Gaius taunted. \u201cUnfortunately, it will do you no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done,\u201d Santiago growled, reaching behind his back to pull the pugio from where he\u2019d shoved it into his jeans pocket.</p><p>Gaius\u2019s face remained slack, but Santiago sensed his surprise at the sight of the ancient dagger with its lethal silver blade.</p><p>\u201cYou can kill this host, but I\u2019ll simply take another,\u201d he warned.</p><p>Santiago\u2019s lips stretched into a humorless smile as he pressed the tip of the dagger to the center of his chest. \u201cI\u2019m betting that you can\u2019t take control of me before I stick this in my heart.\u201d</p><p>Gaius hissed, the glowing eyes narrowing at Santiago\u2019s threat. \u201cHarm yourself and I will simply use the witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. You need her dead.\u201d Santiago shrugged. \u201cNot the best qualification for a host.\u201d</p><p>Gaius shifted his head to stare at the mutilated door, his frustration battering against Santiago\u2019s emotions. \u201cYour fellow vampires are swiftly approaching. Once they realize the door is blocked they\u2019ll find another way in.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his teeth against the swell of irritation, savagely reminding himself he was being manipulated. \u201cBut soon enough?\u201d he managed to rasp.</p><p>\u201cTime is meaningless,\u201d the creature smoothly countered. \u201cWe have an eternity.\u201d</p><p>Santiago gave a slow shake of his head, his gaze lowering to where the flesh around the rebar remained a raw, bleeding wound. It should have been healing by now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. You\u2019re starting to fray around the edges,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is . . . why?\u201d</p><p>The hesitation was so brief that it would have been easy to miss. \u201cI need to feed.\u201d</p><p>Santiago gave another shake of his head. Vampires might take longer to heal when they needed to feed. And even begin to look skeletal if they\u2019d been starved long enough.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t begin to decompose.</p><p>Besides, if this . . . thing needed to feed, why wasn\u2019t he feasting on the witch\u2019s tangible fear? Or even his own fury?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need to feed?\u201d</p><p>Santiago narrowed his gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that.\u201d</p><p>Without warning Sally took a step forward, her arms wrapped around her slender waist. \u201cThe book,\u201d she said.</p><p>Santiago jerked his head toward the gaping hole in the wall where Gaius and this witch seemed to be convinced a book was hidden.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He grimaced. He should have suspected the book was the culprit from the minute he noticed Gaius\u2019s impression of a zombie. If the bastard was willing to risk everything to get his hands on it, then it was obviously his kryptonite. \u201cIt must be draining him.\u201d</p><p>Gaius didn\u2019t bother answering. Instead his attention shifted to the sound of footsteps outside the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo away,\u201d Santiago shouted as the steel door shuddered beneath the impact of Styx\u2019s size-sixteen boot. There was another shudder, before the cement above the door began to crack and buckle.</p><p>Roke.</p><p>It had to be.</p> <p>There was no other vampire who had his particular effect on physical structures. The powerful vampire was a walking, talking (okay, not so much the talking) earthquake machine.</p><p>\u201cDammit, go away,\u201d he shouted again, sensing Gaius\u2019s seething anticipation.</p><p>\u201cSantiago, what the hell is going on?\u201d Styx called through the door, his own power making the lights flicker.</p><p>Another crack appeared along the side of the door, making Santiago curse at Roke\u2019s persistence.</p><p>He had to keep them out of the room. Gaius wouldn\u2019t dare take one of them as a host when it might mean he was trapped on the other side with no way to reach Sally or the book.</p> <p>He glanced toward the witch, who was studying the crumbling wall with an odd expression.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a phone?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She blinked, glancing down at her clinging outfit that clearly had no place to hide the clich\u00e9d thin dime let alone a phone. Thankfully she resisted the urge to point out the obvious, and instead caught him off-guard when she squared her shoulders and tilted her chin. \u201cI can reach them.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cA spell . . . oh shit.\u201d He blinked in shock as she turned her arm over to reveal the distinctive tattoo that crawled beneath the skin of her inner forearm. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>A blush touched her cheeks. \u201cRoke.\u201d</p><p>Taciturn, I-am-an-island-so-don\u2019t-screw-with-me Roke mated with a witch?</p> <p>Fairly certain the entire world had gone mad, Santiago gave a nod of his head. \u201cWarn them to back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d She rolled her eyes as yet another crack appeared. \u201cThey haven\u2019t listened to me yet.\u201d</p><p>Trusting that the witch could convince the vampires to halt their assault on the door, not to mention Roke\u2019s seeming determination to bring the roof down on their heads, Santiago turned back to Gaius.</p><p>He hid his stab of shock as he realized that Gaius was a shade paler and several pounds frailer. Mierda. Even his hair was beginning to fall out.</p><p>Like he was a dog with mange.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the book?\u201d he rasped, resisting the urge to reach up and make sure his own hair wasn\u2019t beginning to shed.</p><p>Surely he would sense if the book was starting to make him rot?</p><p>With a slow, deliberate motion Gaius turned back to study him with his glowing gaze. \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d</p> <p>Santiago shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know, don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are some who claim I\u2019m your god,\u201d the creature informed him with an arrogance that he\u2019d clearly bestowed on his children. \u201cWithout me you would never have existed.\u201d</p><p>Santiago was sublimely unimpressed. \u201cGod or not, we\u2019ve done just fine without you for the past few millennia,\u201d he mocked.</p><p>\u201cNot without me\u2014I\u2019ve been sleeping,\u201d the creature corrected him. \u201cBut what if you destroy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan a god be destroyed?\u201d Santiago demanded with a lift of his brows.</p><p>There was a low hiss. \u201cThe Dark Lord proved it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>Santiago made a sound of disgust. \u201cHe was never a true god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd neither are you.\u201d</p><p>There was a calculating pause as Gaius no doubt considered the best way to manipulate Santiago into destroying the witch. The fact he wasn\u2019t using his ability to provoke Santiago into a bloodlust spoke volumes about the power of the book.</p><p>\u201cBut I am your creator,\u201d he at last said, his voice the dry hiss of a viper. \u201cCan you be certain that my end won\u2019t also be the end of all vampires?\u201d</p><p>No. He couldn\u2019t be certain.</p><p>Which was precisely why he wasn\u2019t going to let himself consider the possibility.</p><p>For now he wasn\u2019t going to concentrate on anything beyond destroying this monster and getting Nefri safely back to his lair.</p><p>\u201cSally.\u201d</p><p>He could smell the female\u2019s terror, but with an admirable display of courage, she moved to stand at his side.</p><p>Maybe Roke hadn\u2019t completely lost his mind in choosing this female.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He slid a questioning glance in her direction. \u201cCan you get the book?\u201d</p><p>She chewed her bottom lip. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, only her death can break the spell,\u201d Gaius snarled, the glow from his eyes filling the room with a malignant light. \u201cIf you\u2019re truly determined to get your hands on the book, then you\u2019ll have to kill her.\u201d</p><p>Santiago refused to allow his gaze to waver from the witch\u2019s youthful face. \u201cSally?\u201d</p><p>She was shivering, but with a grim determination she studied the hole in the wall, as if she were actually able to see the strands of magic woven around the opening.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s sorcery, then it can\u2019t be broken by magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill her, Santiago,\u201d Gaius commanded, weakly attempting to stir Santiago\u2019s fear. \u201cShe\u2019s a danger to Nefri.\u201d</p><p>Sally lifted her hand, her breath hissing between her teeth as she sent Santiago a startled glance.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was considering how to get the book, I assumed it was guarded by a spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s sorcery, then it can\u2019t be broken, but it can be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to her,\u201d Gaius sharply interrupted her. \u201cShe\u2019s a witch, my son. Her very essence is a lie.\u201d</p><p>Santiago ignored the disruption. \u201cCan be what?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>\u201cManipulated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Santiago,\u201d Gaius tried again to twist Santiago\u2019s emotions. \u201cShe was created by the Oracles to destroy me.\u201d He lifted a feeble hand. \u201cTo destroy us.\u201d</p><p>If anyone had told Sally that one day she would play the role of hero (or was it heroine?) she would have laughed until she peed her pants.</p><p>All she wanted was to lay low and keep her head buried in the sand when bad things were happening.</p><p>Even her days as the conduit for the Dark Lord had been nothing more than a desperate attempt to survive. She certainly hadn\u2019t drunk the Kool-Aid, and the minute she had the opportunity she\u2019d given up all ties to her former allies.</p><p>Now, however, laying low wasn\u2019t an option. Which meant that she had to somehow figure out a way to manipulate the sorcery spell while keeping the vampire that was pinned to the wall from sensing her considerable power.</p><p>She didn\u2019t doubt for a second that the nasty creature would do whatever was necessary to stop her if he realized she might actually be one of the few witches alive today capable of gaining command of the spell.</p><p>Not vanity, just the simple truth.</p><p>\u201cYou keep changing your story,\u201d she accused the creepy vampire even as she tentatively opened a small crack in her magical barriers. Barriers she\u2019d created and kept wrapped around herself since she\u2019d nearly been killed by her mother. Nothing like a near filicide to keep a girl on her toes. \u201cFirst you said I was born from a long line of witches to protect the book and now you claim I was created by the Oracles to destroy vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Oracles created the first witches, you stupid bitch,\u201d the creature growled.</p><p>Against her will she found her attention captured by his claim. Was it true? Had witches truly been created by the Oracles or was this man just a raving lunatic?</p><p>Allowing a part of her mind to concentrate on unraveling the complex weaves, she sent the vampire a puzzled glance. \u201cCreated to kill vampires?\u201d</p><p>The glowing eyes were turned in her direction, but Sally didn\u2019t have a clue if he could actually see with them. Not that it mattered. If he was like any other vampire, then his senses would be acute enough to pinpoint a roach a mile away even if he was blind.</p><p>\u201cTo contain me and mute our powers.\u201d He spoke the words with the certainty of a true believer.</p><p>Right or wrong, he was convinced that witches had been created by the Oracles as some sort of weapon against vampires.</p><p>Sally frowned. \u201cWhy would they create an entire species to contain you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were jealous of my powers,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cThey wanted me dead, but they dared not kill a god. The best they could do was lock me away with their pathetic magic.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced; Sally was beginning to suspect that she\u2019d grossly overestimated her skills as she realized that the web of magic was more than one spell. It was as if sorcery had taken the incantation of the thirteen witches and used each one to layer the spells one on top of the other. So it wasn\u2019t thirteen times stronger, but thirteen to the thirteenth power.</p><p>On top of that, now that she\u2019d actually opened her barriers she could feel her connection to the damned thing.</p><p>Maybe the creature was right.</p><p>Maybe she had been called by the book to travel to this location at this exact time.</p><p>Weirder things had happened.</p><p>\u201cNot so pathetic,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Easily sensing her dismay, Santiago took a step toward her. \u201cSally,\u201d he prompted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain, but I think the sorcery is more than just a protective spell.\u201d</p><p>The handsome vampire frowned.

It was a definite case of the blind leading the blind since her knowledge of sorcery could fit in a thimble.</p><p>Still, she had to do something. She could sense Roke\u2019s straining impatience. They had about two minutes flat before he smashed his way through the brick walls.</p><p>\u201cI might be able to use the book . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNooooo.\u201d</p><p>The hair-raising shriek came completely out of the blue. Stumbling backward, Sally turned to watch a strange, black mist float out of the mutilated vampire\u2019s body.</p><p>At her side Santiago cursed, pressing the Roman dagger against his chest until she could smell his flesh beginning to burn and a flow of blood stained his T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cStay back,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>The mist seemed to hesitate, as if it understood Santiago\u2019s threat. Then, with a movement too swift for her eyes to follow, it darted across the room.</p><p>With quicker reflexes, Santiago was lunging forward. But as fast as he was, he was a half step too slow as the mist disappeared into the female vampire who had regained consciousness while they were focused on the mysterious book.</p> <p>Time seemed to stand still as the beautiful woman watched Santiago rushing toward her with such an intense sense of loss it was painful to witness. Then, as Santiago reached her, those dark eyes were filled with an unearthly glow and her slender hands wrapped around the gold medallion at her neck.</p><p>Santiago cried out, but he couldn\u2019t halt the inevitable.</p><p>He reached for her, but she was already gone.</p><p>Santiago roared, his fury exploding the overhead lights and coating the walls in a layer of frost.</p><p>Nefri.</p><p>That bastard had taken his female.</p><p>He was going to rip him apart and feed him to the jackals. No wait. That was too quick.</p><p>He was going to . . .</p> <p>\u201cSantiago,\u201d a harsh voice broke through his searing rage. \u201cMy son.\u201d</p><p>With a growl he whirled toward Gaius, who remained pinned to the wall. His former sire looked like death. Literally.</p><p>His gray skin sagged to reveal the sharp angles of his brittle bones. His dark eyes were sunken, although they\u2019d lost the weird-ass glow, and only a few tenacious clumps of hair remained on his head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d Santiago hissed, flowing across the floor, intent on finishing off the vampire he\u2019d once considered his father.</p><p>Gaius\u2019s gaze was pleading as Santiago halted directly in front of him. \u201cPlease, I need to tell you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Santiago made a sound of disgust. Did this vampire truly have the arrogance to believe that after all he\u2019d done\u2014the abandonment, the betrayals, the treachery\u2014that he could ever gain Santiago\u2019s forgiveness?</p><p>But even as he lifted his hand to strike the killing blow, Santiago found himself hesitating.</p><p>Nefri had disappeared using her medallion. Which meant he couldn\u2019t track her. It could take hours, if not days to discover where she\u2019d gone.</p><p>The creature had been inside Gaius for weeks. If anyone would know where it was headed, it would be this pathetic wreck.</p><p>A gut-wrenching pain nearly doubled him over and with a savage anger he slammed his fist into the wall next to Gaius\u2019s gaunt face.</p><p>\u201cWhere did he take her?\u201d</p><p>Gaius flinched, but he refused to be distracted. \u201cPlease, Santiago, I thought Dara had been returned to me. It seemed so real.\u201d</p><p>Santiago pulled back his lips, exposing his fangs in a visible warning. \u201cTell me where he took her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she was an illusion,\u201d Gaius continued, as if Santiago might actually care that he\u2019d been fooled into believing Dara had been returned. Gaius was eager to blame everyone but himself for his weakness. \u201cNothing more than a figment of my imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d Santiago wrapped his hands around Gaius\u2019s too-thin neck. Every second separated from Nefri was like pouring salt on a gaping wound. \u201cTell me where they went or I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should kill me.\u201d Gaius gave a shake of his head. \u201cI no longer matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit.\u201d With an effort, Santiago managed to keep himself from crushing the bastard\u2019s throat. So long as Gaius was wallowing in his bout of self-pity he would be useless. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>Gaius licked his rotting lips. \u201cI need . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need your forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Santiago bit out, willing to say anything to get Gaius to help him track Nefri. \u201cYou\u2019re forgiven.\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes softened with a soul-deep gratitude. \u201cThank you, my son.\u201d</p><p>Santiago tightened his fingers on his sire\u2019s throat. \u201cNow take me to Nefri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d With a visible effort, Gaius lifted his hand to cover the medallion around his neck. \u201cHold on tight.\u201d</p><p>Santiago scowled. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe medallion,\u201d Gaius rasped. \u201cIt will take us to Nefri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he commanded, glancing toward the wide-eyed witch. \u201cTell Styx what happened here. . . .\u201d</p><p>His words were lost as blackness surrounded him and they were being catapulted through a rift in space.</p><p>Mierda.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>It was a gross understatement to say that Roke\u2019s patience was strained. It was, in fact, hanging on by a very slender thread.</p><p>Which was why it was no surprise that it snapped the second he heard Santiago\u2019s roar.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t believe Sally\u2019s soft whispers in his mind (her ability to reach him telepathically was astonishing since it was a rare talent that usually only manifested itself between pairs that had been intimately bonded for centuries).</p><p>He fully believed that the spirit was capable of taking command of a vampire. And he equally understood the logic of keeping the creature contained by shutting him off from available hosts.</p><p>But logic was no contest against the instincts of a newly mated vampire, and the need to get to Sally was a force that wasn\u2019t going to be denied.</p><p>No matter what the consequences.</p><p>He stepped forward, ignoring Styx\u2019s grim presence. Jagr had taken the Ravens to circle the warehouse, making sure nothing could escape, and Levet had thankfully remained at the lair with his odd demon friend. But it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if they\u2019d all stood between him and his goal.</p><p>He was getting to Sally.</p><p>Now!</p><p>He swung his arm, hitting the brick wall with enough force to make the entire building shudder.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Roke,\u201d Styx growled. \u201cYou said that Sally warned us not to enter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hell with that,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019m done waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Styx reached to grasp his wrist before he could widen the crack he\u2019d just created in the wall. \u201cYou\u2019re going to bring the entire building down on our head.\u201d</p><p>Roke yanked his arm free, his fangs throbbing and his temper threatening to explode. \u201cI don\u2019t care what I have to do. I\u2019m getting into that room.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cGot it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I got it,\u201d Styx muttered. \u201cStand back.\u201d</p><p>Lifting his leg, Styx used his Sasquatch-size boot to kick the center of the door. Steel screeched in protest, but with two more kicks the stubborn door at last twisted off the frame, and before Styx could open his mouth to protest, Roke was leaping through the wreckage.</p><p>He had a brief glimpse of Santiago holding on to a vampire, or at least he thought it was a vampire\u2014the pathetic male looked more like a rotting zombie. Then, just as he began to move across the floor, the two vampires simply disappeared.</p><p>Ignoring the bizarre vanishing act, Roke\u2019s attention honed in on the tiny female who stood near the safe hidden behind the crumbling wall.</p><p>The tightness in his chest eased at being able to see her and catch the sweet scent of peaches. But the driving fury at the knowledge she\u2019d been stolen from him, snatched from beneath his very nose, had him storming forward, not halting until he\u2019d wrapped his arms around her slender body.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, but her voice quavered and her body shivered with the terror she\u2019d been forced to endure.</p><p>\u201cI swear, I\u2019ll kill that bastard,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Her hand lifted to his chest. \u201cRoke.\u201d</p><p>He gave a low growl as he sensed she was about to pull away, burying his face in the curve of her neck.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Like he knew? He was running on a primitive impulse and gut need.</p><p>\u201cJust . . .\u201d His hands ran a compulsive path down the curve of her back. \u201cGive me a minute.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Styx cautiously moved to stand at their side, leaving enough space not to set off Roke\u2019s possessive fury. No doubt he sensed that Roke was on a hair trigger. Or maybe it was his bared fangs that gave it away.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d he said to Sally.</p><p>She gave another shiver and Roke tightened his arms around her, his head lifting to watch his Anasso with a feral warning.</p> <p>\u201cThat creature\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaius?\u201d Styx asked.</p><p>Sally nodded. \u201cYes, although it wasn\u2019t really him. He was being controlled by something inside him.\u201d</p><p>Styx glanced toward the safe just visible through the jagged hole in the wall. \u201cHe brought you here to get the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can harm him.\u201d</p><p>Roke glanced down at her in surprise. \u201cA book?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cThat or the magic in the book.\u201d</p><p>Styx matched her grimace, shifting uneasily. Roke sympathized with his king. Any vampire would rather fight an entire tribe of trolls bare-handed than deal with magic.</p><p>\u201cWhy you?\u201d Styx abruptly asked.</p> <p>Sally blinked. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he go to the trouble of kidnapping you if all he needed was a witch?\u201d The towering warrior clarified. \u201cHe had to know it would alert us to his presence here.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, sending a covert glance toward Roke before she returned her attention to the Anasso.</p><p>\u201cBecause the spell is bound to my soul,\u201d she at last revealed.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Roke snarled, a sharp fear spearing through him. He might be clueless when it came to magic, but he knew that having Sally\u2019s soul bound to a spell was a very bad thing.</p><p>Dammit, why had he ever brought her to this warehouse? He should\u2019ve had the sense to return her to Styx\u2019s lair the second he realized he was susceptible to her magic.</p><p>Now . . . He swallowed a curse.</p><p>No. As eager as he might be to blame himself, he knew fate well enough to realize that if it intended Sally to be reunited with the book, there was nothing he could do to stop the inevitable.</p> <p>But that didn\u2019t make him any happier.</p><p>His dark thoughts were interrupted as Styx stepped toward the hole in the wall, his brows drawn together. \u201cSorcery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m the last surviving heir.\u201d She bit her bottom lip, the scent of her lingering terror making Roke twitch with the need to rip the spirit into painful pieces. Several painful pieces. \u201cIf he can kill me, then he can destroy the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s killing you,\u201d Roke snapped.</p><p>She flashed him a weak smile. \u201cThat was my hope.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes locked. His filled with a bleak promise of protection; hers filled with a rueful regret.</p><p>\u201cWhy can this book hurt the spirit?\u201d Styx intruded into their silent exchange.</p><p>Sally shrugged. \u201cI won\u2019t know until I manage to unravel the threads of sorcery protecting it.\u201d</p><p>Roke went rigid. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoke.\u201d She firmly pulled out of his arms, her chin set to a militant angle. \u201cWe have to find out what\u2019s in that book.\u201d</p><p>His hands clenched as he brutally squashed the need to jerk her back into the safety of his arms. Instead he turned his head to glare at his king. \u201cAnd if this is a trick?\u201d</p><p>Styx arched a dark brow. \u201cWhat kind of trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the damned spirit pretended the book could harm him just so we would do everything in our powers to destroy the magic that guards it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sally gave a shake of her head, her nose wrinkling. \u201cThere was no doubt it was being affected by its proximity to the book. It was rotting from the inside out.\u201d</p><p>Roke folded his arms over his chest, his stance warning he was a male about to dig in his heels. \u201cAll the more reason to leave it alone until we know more about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder any other circumstances I would agree with you, amigo,\u201d Styx said, a hint of compassion on his face. \u201cBut in this case, neither of us is in a position to make a reasoned decision.\u201d He nodded toward Sally. \u201cOnly our expert can decide what\u2019s best.\u201d</p><p>She widened her eyes in faux shock. \u201cYou mean I\u2019m allowed to have my very own opinion? Amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSally . . .\u201d Roke began.</p><p>\u201cI have to do this,\u201d the stubborn witch interrupted him before he could even state his case.</p><p>He scowled. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hands in seething frustration. \u201cBecause there\u2019s a creature out there who claims to be the god of vampires and is convinced that his survival depends on my death. I\u2019d rather get him instead of waiting around for him to get me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good offense is truly the best defense, Roke,\u201d Styx said in tones that were clearly intended to be soothing.</p><p>Roke, however, was in no mood to be soothed. He was mad as hell at a fate that would force him into an unwanted mating (with a witch, for god\u2019s sake) and then once his most possessive instincts were fully committed, threaten to take her away.</p><p>\u201cAnd if it was Darcy?\u201d he accused him.</p><p>Styx rolled his eyes. \u201cBy now you should know that my mate charges into danger with nerve-shattering regularity.\u201d</p><p>Roke couldn\u2019t argue. The tiny pure-blooded Were was as irrationally stubborn and uncontrollable as Sally.</p><p>As if to rub salt in a very tender wound, Sally narrowed her eyes, the scent of peaches filling the air. \u201cThis is my decision, no one else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d He squashed a wry laugh as he met her warning glare. He\u2019d been so smugly certain he would be able to choose a submissive, easily trainable mate who would always understand that the duties of his clan came first. What he had instead . . . His heart gave a dangerous twist, something far more potent than a forced mating tingling through his blood. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d he roughly demanded.</p><p>She turned to pace toward the gap in the wall, her hand stroking at the edges of the hole, as if testing the invisible spell.</p><p>\u201cSorcery is similar to magic,\u201d she said slowly, averting her face as if she could hide her uncertainty behind the satin curtain of autumn hair. \u201cBut the spells aren\u2019t connected to a specific incantation or brew or sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s connected to you,\u201d he said in flat tones.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He took a step forward, his hands still clenched. \u201cWhich means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I should be able to peel back the layers of magic like an onion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould be able to?\u201d</p><p>She turned to meet his smoldering glare. \u201cWhat do you want me to say? I\u2019ve never tried to break through sorcery before.\u201d She gave a restless lift of her shoulder. \u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t even believe it truly existed.\u201d Sally then proceeded to tell Roke and Styx the rest of what had occurred in the warehouse before they had broken in as Santiago had asked her to.</p><p>\u201cGod almighty,\u201d he growled, his jaw clenched so tight his teeth threatened to shatter. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the death of me.\u201d</p><p>Without warning her expression hardened, her hands landing on her hips. \u201cNo. That\u2019s one thing I won\u2019t be,\u201d she informed him. \u201cI need everyone to leave before I start\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was standing in front of her, wrapping his fingers around her upper arms in an unbreakable grip before she could even blink.</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so stubborn, Roke,\u201d she muttered, pretending she wasn\u2019t unnerved by his inhuman speed. \u201cIf the book could hurt the spirit, then there\u2019s a good chance it can hurt all vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSantiago looked unharmed before he disappeared,\u201d he reminded her. Not that he would have left even if Santiago had matched his decomposing companion.</p><p>At least not without this female.</p><p>Her lips thinned in annoyance. \u201cI can\u2019t concentrate with you breathing down my neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well give it up,\u201d Styx drawled as he moved to stand beside them. \u201cI recognize that expression. You\u2019d have better luck arguing with that brick wall.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted to continue the quarrel, then catching the determination etched onto Roke\u2019s face, she heaved a resigned sigh. \u201cFine,\u201d she grudgingly conceded. \u201cBut don\u2019t bitch at me when things go to hell.\u201d</p><p>His hand lifted to tuck her hair behind her ear, his touch gentle. \u201cThen we\u2019ll go there together.\u201d</p><p>Beyond the Veil</p><p>Nefri had never been truly defenseless.</p><p>She\u2019d been used, abused, vulnerable, and on occasion, so out of control she\u2019d become no less lethal than a nuclear bomb.</p><p>But she\u2019d always had her powers. Which meant she\u2019d never truly known the terror of being at the absolute mercy of another creature.</p><p>Now she blinked as she glanced around the empty marble building with fluted columns, and a domed roof that was painted to resemble the blue skies no vampire had ever seen. Below her feet was a delicate mosaic and in the center of the building was a fountain that was surrounded by marble nymphs dancing in the spray of water. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a place of meditation, which meant that no one would enter once they sensed her presence. Thank the gods. But she couldn\u2019t hope that the spirit who had taken command of her body would be content to remain secluded.</p><p>Already she could feel her emotions being agitated by the creature, although she sensed he was still weakened. She had to get away from her people.</p><p>Or, if worst came to worst, she would have to end her life.</p> <p>A small price to pay for the salvation of her clan.</p><p>Right. All very noble and completely worthless, she dryly concluded, as long as the spirit was in control of her body.</p><p>For the moment her only hope was that she could find a way to regain command. Or that Santiago would be able . . .</p><p>No.</p><p>The last thing she wanted was Santiago to be in danger.</p> <p>If she tried to reach out for help it would be the Oracles. They were, after all, the ones who\u2019d started this whole mess.</p><p>Trying to clear her mind enough to reach out mentally to Siljar, she was abruptly distracted as a vampire stepped in the room.</p><p>He was a short, bullishly built male with a bluntly carved face and silver hair that was pulled into a tight queue at his neck. Oddly, he was dressed in a velvet tunic and leggings that had been the fashion centuries ago, with a heavy war hammer clenched in one hand.</p><p>Holy hell.</p><p>She would have stumbled backward in shock if she\u2019d been in control of her legs. As it was, she was forced to stand in frozen horror as her former master strolled to a halt directly before her.</p><p>\u201cAh, my blessed daughter.\u201d Theo\u2019s voice rumbled through the thick silence, his pale brown eyes shimmering with the same insatiable greed she remembered with acute revulsion. \u201cAt long last.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she hissed. \u201cYou\u2019re not real.\u201d</p><p>He sneered with pleasure at her swelling fear. \u201cDid you miss me, my beautiful Amazon?\u201d</p><p>Miss him?</p><p>She\u2019d put him in his grave.</p><p>How else was she ever to halt the devastation he was forcing her to wreak on innocents?</p><p>So many killings . . .</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead,\u201d she managed to grit.</p><p>\u201cDead, but not forgotten.\u201d</p> <p>She felt her fear being shifted to fury, the emotion swelling through the air and spilling out of the building. Soon the intense passions would be infecting her people and the spirit would be able to feast to his cruel heart\u2019s content.</p><p>That\u2019s why it had created this vision of her former sire.</p><p>It had rooted around in her mind until it had managed to locate the one memory capable of producing the most intense reaction.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t let you use me.\u201d Grimly she struggled to leash her anger, already sensing the bewildered reaction of her people. \u201cNot again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re such a loyal soldier,\u201d he mocked, looking so real that Nefri could almost sympathize with Gaius\u2019s belief that his mate had been returned to him. \u201cSo eager to please me that you were willing to destroy an entire clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now, Nefri,\u201d he chided. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><p>Against her will the memory of the brutal battle that had killed over two dozen vampires and their human servants seared through her mind, leaving behind an aching sadness laced with a crippling guilt.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Theo laughed, relishing her pain. \u201cDo you hear their screams when you close your eyes?\u201d</p><p>Still locked in her paralysis, she could only tremble as the spirit ruthlessly played her emotions like they were a musical instrument.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you taste their blood?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s still there. The monster inside you just waiting to be released.\u201d</p><p>And that was it.</p><p>Her greatest fear.</p><p>The reason she had traveled beyond the Veil and devoted herself to creating a place of utter peace.</p><p>A Garden of Eden.</p><p>Only I am the serpent, a voice whispered in the back of her mind. The devil just waiting to destroy paradise.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you tired of denying your emotions?\u201d Theo asked, his tone lowering to become a hypnotic murmur. \u201cOf being less than who you are?\u201d</p><p>She desperately tried to block out the insidious voice, hearing the distant sounds of fights beginning to break out among her clan.</p><p>Violence where there had never been any before.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t listen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so proud of you,\u201d her dead master purred. \u201cA beautiful, lethal weapon who could make the world shudder in fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what have you become?\u201d he persisted. \u201cA shallow husk of yourself. A female who is forced to cower behind this Veil as if you\u2019re ashamed of your greatness.\u201d</p><p>Her muscles trembled as she tried to fight against the spirit holding her captive.</p><p>She had to get free long enough to find a weapon. She knew beyond a doubt once the spirit had fed enough to regain its strength it would send her on a bloodbath that would destroy her people.</p><p>She was going to die before she allowed that to happen.</p><p>Caught in the strange, motionless battle, Nefri almost missed the familiar scent that floated on the breeze.</p><p>\u201cSantiago?\u201d she whispered in confusion.</p><p>The vision of Theo briefly wavered, becoming a black mist, as Nefri concentrated on the sense of Santiago approaching the building. Then, with a sharp movement the illusion was coalescing and shifting to block her vision.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d her sire growled. \u201cSend him away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>The pale brown eyes hardened with an ugly anger. \u201cHe\u2019s like all the others, can\u2019t you see that? He only wants to use you.\u201d</p><p>Just a few days ago the cruel taunt would have hit its mark. She\u2019d been manipulated and abused too many times not to harbor a suspicion that anyone trying to get too close wanted something from her.</p><p>Now, however, she didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she said with an unmistakable confidence.</p><p>\u201cWhy else would he be with you?\u201d Theo demanded. \u201cIf he truly cared he would have listened when you insisted you preferred to be left alone.\u201d</p><p>A soft warmth flowed through her heart, replacing the anger and pain and fear that had been coursing from her and pulsing through the air to infect her people.</p><p>\u201cHe cares about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe only wants your power,\u201d Theo snarled. \u201cWith you he can take command of his own clan.

You know I will always be here for you. I will never fail you.\u201d He held out one arm in welcome even as he clutched the seemingly unconscious Gaius in the other. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>What was he doing?</p><p>Did he think she could actually fight off the spirit?</p><p>She might be powerful, but she wasn\u2019t Wonder Woman.</p><p>A cry was wrenched from her throat as her body was suddenly hurtling forward, her fangs fully extended. It was the only warning Santiago had, but it should have been plenty to give him the opportunity to dodge her attack.</p><p>Instead, he stood with an unwavering determination, barely flinching when she rammed into him with the force of a cement truck.</p><p>Her fangs sank in his neck as he wrapped an arm around her waist, his voice barely audible over the terror that pounded through her.</p><p>\u201cNow, Gaius.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>Sally had never actually tried to walk around with an elephant on her back. It wasn\u2019t the sort of thing that even a witch did on a regular basis. But after the past few minutes she was pretty sure she now knew what it would feel like.</p><p>Kneeling in front of the safe, which had been fully exposed by the simple process of Styx and Roke bashing through the remaining bricks, she felt sweat trickling down her face and her muscles trembling in protest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d used magic from the day she\u2019d left her cradle. Maybe even before then.</p><p>She\u2019d perfected the fine art of casting until she could perform them with flawless precision; she could brew potions that were so potent they sold for twice the usual price. And she could sense a spell from a remarkable distance.</p><p>But while she was highly proficient in the usual arts, she\u2019d never actually tried to manipulate magic.</p> <p>It was . . . exhausting.</p><p>Both mentally and physically.</p><p>Each layer of magic had to be carefully unraveled from the complex web, but it wasn\u2019t like they disappeared. She had to maintain her hold on each thread while continuing to loosen the others.</p><p>And all the while, she knew one wrong tug could create an explosion that would destroy even vampires.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, she tried to ignore her rapidly fading strength. Just a little more and . . . a moan was wrenched from her throat as she felt herself beginning to sway.</p> <p>Crap, crap, crap.</p><p>She raised her hands to keep from falling on her face, but she\u2019d barely moved an inch when strong arms wrapped around her and the sensation of cool, euphoric power pulsed through her weary body.</p><p>Roke.</p><p>He was using their connection to give her the strength she needed.</p><p>The debilitating fatigue faded from her mind and she tilted back her head to offer a grateful smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>His lean, compelling face remained hard with disapproval even as he gently brushed a strand of hair from her pale cheek. \u201cSally, you can\u2019t keep going like this,\u201d he said gruffly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d His voice was strained, as if he were barely preventing himself from physically hauling her away from the warehouse. \u201cYou\u2019re going to burn yourself out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop now.\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes smoldered with frustration. \u201cYou can at least rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If I let go . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cLet\u2019s just say bad things will happen.\u201d</p><p>His arm abruptly tightened around her shoulders, his expression resolute. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you? Nothing is going to happen to you,\u201d he swore softly.</p> <p>A treacherous warmth threatened to melt her heart as he regarded her with an unwavering devotion. Her very own hero who would slay her endless parade of dragons.</p><p>Then she was grimly squashing the stupid thought.</p><p>His devotion wasn\u2019t real. It was nothing more than a symptom of the mating she\u2019d forced on him.</p><p>It would disappear the moment they managed to break the bond.</p><p>And she would be an idiot to let herself believe for a second that beneath the sham of their mating Roke considered her anything but the enemy.</p><p>And that if they managed to survive the night, she would soon be alone, with no one to depend on but herself.</p><p>Again.</p><p>\u201cConsidering the fact I\u2019ve had a bounty on my head since I was sixteen, there\u2019s a good possibility that it\u2019s going to be a daily lecture,\u201d she muttered wryly. \u201cOr at least until\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d he broke in, to her reminder this was only temporary.</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do to help?\u201d Styx demanded, keeping guard near the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can help,\u201d she admitted, her concentration returning to the numerous threads that she struggled to keep from slipping her magical grasp. \u201cI have to do this on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not alone,\u201d Roke whispered in her ear, tugging her until her back was pressed against the solid muscles of his chest. \u201cLean against me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart did that terrible melting thing again, but she focused her energy on the remaining weave that protected the book.</p><p>Even with Roke\u2019s added strength she was soon soaked in perspiration, her knees aching from being pressed against the hard floor, and her mind pounding with a headache that wasn\u2019t going to be cured by a couple of extra-strength aspirin.</p><p>Then, she slowly peeled away the last weave to reveal the book that the sorcery had been protecting.</p><p>A book that wasn\u2019t a book.</p><p>\u201cBlessed goddess,\u201d she breathed in shock.</p><p>Roke stiffened. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI removed the last layer of magic.\u201d</p><p>Styx was at their side before she could even blink. Damn vampire speed.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>She instinctively pressed into Roke\u2019s comforting hold. It wasn\u2019t that he was any less intimidating than the King of Vampires. But he was at least . . . familiar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>Styx warily glanced inside the top of the safe that had been ripped off by Roke.</p><p>\u201cCan you sense the book?\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cOh yes.\u201d</p><p>Roke shifted so he could study her troubled expression. \u201cIs it magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a . . .\u201d She bit her bottom lip, struggling to find the words to explain the darkness that threatened to suck them all into oblivion. \u201cA void.\u201d</p><p>Styx turned to stab her with a piercing gaze. \u201cA void?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a black hole that sucks away everything around it.\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been so weary she would have laughed as Styx jumped away from the safe as if he\u2019d been poked by a cattle prod.</p><p>\u201cAre we in danger?\u201d he growled.</p><p>She used her magic to probe the strange void, baffled by the sense that it was pulling in . . . something, but unable to determine exactly what that \u201csomething\u201d was.</p><p>\u201cNot immediate danger,\u201d she said slowly, grimacing at her companions\u2019 matching expressions of aggravation. \u201cHey, that\u2019s all I can promise.\u201d</p><p>Roke absently smoothed a comforting hand down her back. She swallowed a rueful sigh. He was obnoxious and arrogant and bossy beyond bearing, but someday he truly was going to make some female a wonderful mate.</p><p>\u201cSo how was this book able to hurt the spirit?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Hmmm. How to explain what she was sensing to two vampires who made a habit of pretending magic didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really a book,\u201d she at last admitted.</p><p>Predictably Roke frowned in suspicion. He understood a book. Even one that might hold magical spells. \u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hands, searching for the right words. \u201cIt has the physical appearance of a book, but it\u2019s only a focal point for the power.\u201d</p><p>Roke frowned, but not bothering to try and question what a focal point might be, he honed in on the most important detail of her revelation. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain why it affects the spirit.\u201d</p><p>Styx paced toward the door and back, clearly lost in his own thoughts. \u201cSantiago said that the creature feeds on emotion,\u201d he abruptly stated.</p><p>\u201cSo a void . . .\u201d Roke\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOf course. It would starve him.\u201d</p><p>It took a minute for Sally to follow their line of logic, then she gave a sound of shock.</p><p>The void was absorbing emotions.</p><p>A perfect weapon to battle the creature.</p><p>Whether or not it was created to perform some other purpose was impossible for her to say.</p><p>\u201cCan the book, or whatever the hell it is, be moved?\u201d Styx asked, his warrior mind already considering the best way to use their unexpected advantage.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIn theory.\u201d</p><p>Styx nodded. \u201cSo now the question is, how do we track a spirit that can seemingly jump from body to body?\u201d</p><p>It was Sally\u2019s turn to be struck by a sudden fear. Not for herself. But for Roke, who would insist on being a part of the hunt for the spirit.</p><p>\u201cSantiago knows this is the only thing that can hurt the creature,\u201d she hurriedly pointed out. \u201cHe\u2019ll do everything in his power to return him to this warehouse.\u201d</p><p>Styx looked far from pleased by her sensible suggestion. Like all vampires he had the patience of a human five-year-old.</p><p>Or maybe the need to leap willy-nilly into danger was a male thing.</p><p>\u201cSo we wait?\u201d he growled.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWhat else can we do?\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Roke was straightening, dragging her upright so he could wrap her in his arms. \u201cI know what you\u2019re going to do,\u201d he said in tones that made the hair on her nape stand upright.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done your part.\u201d He held her gaze, his expression ruthless. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to return to your rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Styx abruptly nipped her urge to argue in the bud. \u201cIt\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>There was no warning.</p><p>At least none that Sally could detect.</p><p>It was simply as if an invisible doorway opened and an entwined trio of vampires tumbled into the room.</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d she croaked.</p><p>Santiago had endured torture on an epic scale.</p><p>In the Gladiator pits mere survival meant enduring pain that would kill a lesser demon.</p><p>But even prepared, he couldn\u2019t prevent his grunt of agony as Nefri\u2019s fangs sank into his throat and her claws dug deep grooves into his back.</p><p>Cristo.</p><p>He\u2019d known she was lethal, but even without using her innate powers she was a formidable enemy. He would have only minutes before she tired of her game and ended him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Time enough?</p><p>He was about to find out.</p><p>Keeping a death grip on the rapidly dying Gaius, as well as maintaining his hold on Nefri, he braced himself for their abrupt return to the warehouse.</p> <p>He would never, ever get used to traveling through space like a damned Jinn.</p><p>His feet had barely hit the floor when he sensed Styx rushing forward.</p><p>\u201cSantiago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He dropped Gaius so he could hold out a warning hand. \u201cShe\u2019s being controlled by the spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d the Anasso growled. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for the bastard.\u201d</p> <p>On cue Nefri ripped her fangs from his throat, whirling to face the towering vampire.</p><p>\u201cSo. At last I meet the great Anasso,\u201d Nefri mocked, her power beginning to fill the air. \u201cThe King of All Vampires.\u201d</p><p>Styx moved backward, drawing Nefri away.

The small piece of metal had caused untold misery. \u201cKeep it,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cNo . . .\u201d Gaius grimaced, his rotting face a gruesome mockery of the handsome, vital vampire he\u2019d been just weeks ago. \u201cYou must destroy it.\u201d</p><p>He was right.</p> <p>Even if the Dark Lord was dead and they managed to destroy the spirit that was their latest threat, the medallion symbolized evil.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be allowed to remain in the world.</p><p>Santiago reluctantly took the medallion. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Santiago interrupted. He would never be able to fully forgive this man for his betrayals. Not when he\u2019d nearly destroyed the world with his selfish needs. But a part of him now at least understood what would drive a man to such extremes. \u201cI will remember my sire as the man who took me into his lair and gave me a home,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cThe man who taught me the meaning of family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon . . . my son . . .\u201d A shattered moan of relief hissed past Gaius\u2019s lips before the light died from his eyes and he was allowed to escape the slow, painful decay.</p><p>Rising to his feet as Gaius turned to ash, Santiago slipped the medallion into his pocket, determined to honor his sire\u2019s last request.</p><p>Then he turned just in time to witness Nefri sending a blast of power toward Styx.</p><p>The very air sizzled before the power smacked into Styx with enough force to send him flying into the far wall. The entire building shook from the impact, broken plaster cascading down on their heads.</p><p>\u201cYou truly can\u2019t think you can beat me,\u201d Nefri said in genuine incredulity. \u201cI created you.\u201d</p><p>Styx pulled himself from the rubble, dusting the clinging bits of cement from his leather pants. \u201cWhat makes you think I need to beat you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy else would Santiago so cleverly force me back here?\u201d With a sharp thrust of her hand, Nefri\u2019s power again sent Styx crashing into the wall.</p><p>Santiago cursed, knowing that the violent collision with the wall had to be cracking bones and puncturing inner organs. The Anasso, however, refused to betray the slightest hint of vulnerability as he surged upright, allowing his own powers to knock Nefri backward.</p><p>\u201cBecause we have a gift for you,\u201d Styx drawled. \u201cWe\u2019ve removed the protective spells around the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Nefri hissed, her body growing rigid as the spirit belatedly realized the danger. \u201cI won\u2019t be trapped. Not again.\u201d</p><p>Styx smiled. \u201cNot your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFool.\u201d</p><p>With a screech that nearly busted Santiago\u2019s eardrum, Nefri launched herself toward Styx, her power exploding through the room to send them tumbling to the floor.</p><p>Fighting against pulses of frigid energy that threatened to crush him, Santiago forced himself back to his feet. Step by painful step he inched forward, his heart clenched with fear as Styx struggled to hold off the vampire lost in her bloodlust.</p><p>Nefri went for his neck, her fangs instead sinking into the Anasso\u2019s forearm, which he raised to block her. His other hand shot out, gripping her lower face as he prepared to crush her jaws.</p><p>\u201cStyx,\u201d Santiago called. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>The king turned his head to regard him with a furious disbelief. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you damage Nefri the creature will simply take control of you, then we\u2019ll never stop it,\u201d he warned.</p><p>Nefri\u2019s power was off the charts.</p><p>Styx, however, had gained a connection to thousands of vampires who called him their Anasso. If the spirit\u2019s infection could be transferred through his bond to his people . . . mierda.</p><p>Perhaps following his line of reasoning, Styx strained to contain the rabid vampire trying to chew her way through his arm, shifting his attention to Roke and the witch, who were kneeling next to the safe.</p><p>\u201cSally,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>The pretty witch wrinkled her nose as she rose to her feet, reaching into the safe to pull out a book.</p><p>Or at least, he thought it was a book.</p><p>There was a hazy, insubstantial quality to it, as if it weren\u2019t entirely solid.</p><p>Typical.</p><p>Was anything what it seemed to be anymore?</p><p>Carefully she walked forward, an anxious Roke hovering next to her.</p><p>It was only as the witch neared Nefri that Santiago realized the fierce power that had been pulsing through the room had abruptly diminished.</p><p>Was Nefri so consumed by her bloodlust that the spirit had lost control of her?</p><p>Or was the approaching book draining its powers?</p><p>He had his answer when Nefri abruptly turned, her mouth bloody and her eyes glowing.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she snarled, headed straight for the witch.</p><p>With a roar, Roke was shoving Sally behind him and meeting Nefri\u2019s charge.</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d Styx muttered, diving forward to grab Nefri with his one good arm. His other was a mangled mess. \u201cSantiago, help me.\u201d</p><p>Santiago instantly moved to wrap his arms around Nefri, realizing it was going to be impossible to convince Roke not to do his best to kill Nefri.</p><p>The male vampire\u2019s mate was in danger.</p><p>There was nothing he wouldn\u2019t do to protect her.</p><p>Just as there was nothing he wouldn\u2019t do to protect Nefri.</p><p>Trapping her arms against her slender body while Styx looped his arm around her waist, they pulled her away from the infuriated Roke.</p><p>It was a struggle, but the fact that they\u2019d managed to contain Nefri at all was yet another sign that the spirit\u2019s resources were being rapidly drained.</p><p>\u201cSally, finish this,\u201d Styx commanded between clenched teeth.</p><p>The witch tried to step past her bristling mate only to be halted when he grabbed her arm and growled low in his throat.</p><p>\u201cRoke,\u201d she murmured, her expression pleading. \u201cYou have to let me go.\u201d</p><p>He bared his fangs, any sanity lost beneath the primitive instinct to protect his mate. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to end this now,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d a female voice said as a jolt of electric energy penetrated, and then smothered, the power surging from the vampires.</p><p>No one had to turn to know who had so unexpectedly crashed the party.</p><p>Siljar was the only one who could make such a spectacular entrance and overwhelm even the most dominant vampires.</p><p>Slowly the tiny demon moved to stand at Sally\u2019s side, her black almond eyes unblinking and her heart-shaped face somber. Wearing her traditional white robe and her silver hair pulled into a braid, she had the regal bearing of a queen.</p><p>\u201cLet her go, vampire,\u201d she commanded.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>With a glare that should have made the Oracle spontaneously combust, Roke grudgingly released his hold on the witch. Even lost in primordial instincts, a demon understood there was no fighting one of the Commission.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Lifting her hand, Sally gently touched his cheek before turning back to Nefri with a bleak resolution.</p><p>As expected, Nefri went wild as the witch moved forward.</p><p>Styx cursed, grunting as one of Nefri\u2019s arms came free so she could rake her claws down his face.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Santiago, hold on to her.\u201d</p><p>Santiago\u2019s knee shattered beneath the impact of Nefri\u2019s kick, and a rib cracked from the swinging elbow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d he muttered, regaining control of her arms only to have her jerk her head backward to bust Styx\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cTry harder,\u201d the king gritted, spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Together they slowly halted her struggles, her screams of frustration becoming whimpers of fear as Sally pressed the book against her stomach.</p> <p>\u201cIf I die, she dies,\u201d the spirit warned, the glowing gaze turning toward Santiago. \u201cDo you hear me, Santiago?

Then she shifted her attention to Sally.</p><p>\u201cI will need your assistance, witch.\u201d</p><p>Sally grimaced, her face drenched in sweat and her slender body trembling as she continued to hold the strange book against Nefri. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about sorcery,\u201d she said, her voice strained.</p><p>\u201cI will start the weave; I just need you to help hold the threads.\u201d</p><p>It all sounded like gibberish to Santiago, but Sally gave a hesitant nod. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Siljar closed her eyes and held out her tiny hands. \u201cLet\u2019s begin.\u201d</p> <p>Santiago was vaguely aware of Roke moving to support Sally\u2019s swaying body and Styx\u2019s hiss of pain as Nefri gave him another head butt, but his sole focus was on the woman wrapped in his arms.</p><p>He felt her shudder, her skin turning ashen as the witch and Oracle performed their mystical voodoo.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me, Nefri,\u201d he husked. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare leave me again.\u201d</p><p>The glow began to fade from her eyes and for a horrified moment, Santiago thought he was truly losing her.</p><p>No.</p><p>He tightened his arms, silently willing her to survive.</p><p>At first he could feel nothing. As if she\u2019d already slipped away from him. Then, as he stubbornly refused to concede defeat, he felt a . . . spark. The tiniest awareness of the female he adored beyond all bearing.</p><p>A relief so vast it threatened to send him to his knees flooded through him, and ignoring the crowd watching their every move, he gently cupped her face.</p> <p>\u201cHey there, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Her brows drew together as she struggled to focus on his face. \u201cSantiago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She gave a slow, painful nod. \u201cI need . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to promise me.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer despite Styx\u2019s growl of warning, trying to catch her soft words. \u201cPromise you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t let the spirit control me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSiljar is here with the witch,\u201d he tried to soothe, knowing that losing control of her body and power was her worst nightmare come true. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get rid of it.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hand to weakly clutch at his arm. \u201cIf it gets loose again, I want you to swear you\u2019ll kill me before allowing it to use me.\u201d</p><p>A part of him wanted to offer comfort.</p><p>To say whatever was necessary to ease her fears.</p><p>But, a larger part understood he couldn\u2019t lie.</p><p>Not to a woman he intended to spend the rest of eternity with.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes filled with a fear that sent a stab of agony through his heart.</p><p>\u201cSantiago, I couldn\u2019t bear it,\u201d she pleaded, her face still ashen and drawn with weariness. \u201cYou know I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t bear to lose you,\u201d he said with a blunt honesty. He\u2019d intended to save his proclamation of love until a more appropriate time. Like when the current life or death situation was over. Perhaps at a location that could be considered at least a little romantic. And at the very least, he\u2019d intended for them to be alone. Now, he accepted that the time or place was meaningless. If the past few months had taught him nothing else, it was that there was no promise of tomorrow. He wasn\u2019t wasting another second without telling this woman what she meant to him. \u201cYou are my very reason for living.\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes softened with a love that he could tangibly feel flowing between them even as her expression remained set in stubborn lines. \u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He brushed his lips over the chilled skin of her cheek to the corner of her mouth. \u201cAsk me to be your mate. Ask me to stand at your side for the rest of eternity. Ask me to love and honor and respect you,\u201d he husked. \u201cBut don\u2019t ask me to sacrifice you. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be no further sacrifices required,\u201d Siljar said in a weary voice. \u201cAt least not today.\u201d</p><p>Santiago glanced up to discover Roke carrying an unconscious Sally toward the door and Siljar leaning against a pile of rubble. He frowned as he realized the book had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the spirit?\u201d</p><p>Siljar grimaced, her devastating power for once muted. \u201cIt has been sent to the Commission. There are those qualified to keep it imprisoned.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>Nefri regained her balance, although she allowed Santiago to keep a protective arm around her shoulders. She already sensed that there wasn\u2019t a power on this earth that could force him to release his hold on her.</p><p>Besides, she liked the solid weight. It reminded her that after endless centuries of being alone, she now had a companion she not only trusted, but who filled her heart with a joy she\u2019d never dreamed was possible.</p><p>This man.</p><p>This glorious, irreverent, sexy vampire she loved without condition.</p><p>The man she intended to claim as her mate.</p><p>At least once she could be absolutely certain the danger was over.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you destroy it?\u201d she demanded of the Oracle, belatedly noticing that the tiny demon looked as drained as Nefri felt.</p><p>\u201cBecause none of us could be certain what would happen if we did.\u201d</p><p>Styx stepped forward, his arm still healing from her savage attack and his face bloody. \u201cCryptic as ever, Siljar,\u201d he accused her.</p><p>\u201cNot cryptic. The simple truth,\u201d Siljar answered, one of the few demons in the world not terrified of the King of Vampires. \u201cThe creature is dangerous, but it did spawn vampires as well as other species of demons.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cTo destroy it might very well damage its offspring in ways we can\u2019t predict.\u201d</p><p>Nefri gave a grudging nod. Life and death were a far more delicate balance than most people realized.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s in that . . .\u201d She struggled to remember through the haze that had clouded her mind. Hadn\u2019t the witch been pressing something against her? Something that had driven the spirit from her body? Ah, yes. \u201cBook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s trapped in a vacuum between time and space,\u201d the Oracle said. \u201cSo long as it\u2019s properly monitored it won\u2019t be allowed to escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you have thought of that before sending Nefri\u2019s clan into danger?\u201d Santiago asked, as always living on the edge.</p><p>Thankfully, Siljar didn\u2019t appear offended. Instead she gave a lift of her brows. \u201cNefri\u2019s clan?\u201d</p><p>Santiago tightened his arm around her. \u201cOur clan.\u201d</p><p>Siljar smiled in satisfaction. Not the most reassuring sight considering the razor sharp teeth. \u201cThe sorcery created by the witches was enough to hold it prisoner for centuries.\u201d</p><p>Santiago lifted a brow. \u201cSo you had no nefarious purpose in allowing Nefri to lead her people beyond the Veil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came to me with a request for a place of peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Santiago pressed, ignoring Nefri\u2019s frown. He wasn\u2019t fooled for a moment by the Oracles display of innocence.</p><p>The tiny demon gave a dismissive wave of her hand. \u201cAnd we hoped that having her people living beyond the Veil would give us an early warning if the spirit did start to waken.\u201d</p><p>Before Santiago could say something even more stupid than usual, Nefri smoothly cut him off. \u201cBut the spirit never disturbed my clan,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cAt least, not that we ever noticed.\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes suddenly held a deep, unfathomable wisdom. \u201cUnfortunately, we didn\u2019t realize how thin the walls between dimensions had become. The spirit was able to remain hidden while manipulating a handful of vampires into killing the witches, and then slipping past the Veil using Gaius\u2019s medallion.\u201d</p><p>Styx snorted at the understatement. Nefri didn\u2019t blame him. The thinning of barriers had been more than unfortunate. It had been a breath from the apocalyptic.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, and while the spirit was sneaking around, we were all nearly killed by the Dark Lord,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cYou remember that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Siljar squared her shoulders, smoothing her hands down the robe that was once again a pristine white. \u201cThe Commission was concentrating on trying to locate several missing prisoners that escaped through the weakened dimensions while you put an end to the threat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSeveral?\u201d Nefri muttered as the two males hissed in shock. \u201cDo you mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have the medallion?\u201d Siljar interrupted, holding out an imperious hand.</p><p>Santiago hesitated, clearly consumed by a need to demand a further explanation of the missing prisoners.</p> <p>Such as whether they\u2019d been captured or were lurking in the shadows to cause yet another catastrophe.</p><p>Thankfully, her sharp elbow to his ribs helped him recall the dangers of antagonizing a member of the Commission.</p><p>With a grimace he dug into his pocket and pulled out the medallion. Nefri lightly touched his arm, knowing he would be suffering from the loss of his sire.</p><p>No matter what Gaius had done, they\u2019d shared a connection that could never be truly broken.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he muttered gruffly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d Siljar reached up to snatch it from his hand.</p><p>Santiago frowned. \u201cIt needs to be destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be taken care of,\u201d Siljar promised, and with a wave of her hand, the medallion disappeared.</p><p>Whether it was hidden in the folds of her robe, or something more mysterious, was impossible to know.</p><p>Santiago wasn\u2019t satisfied. \u201cTaken care of? Does that mean destroyed?\u201d</p><p>Siljar offered her unnerving smile. \u201cI must go.\u201d She paused to bid Nefri a low bow. \u201cNefri. We are in your debt.\u201d</p> <p>Straightening, the tiny demon disappeared, leaving behind three vampires who were struggling to accept that they had actually survived.</p><p>\u201cSomeday . . .\u201d Styx growled.</p><p>\u201cNot now, Styx,\u201d Santiago said in soft but startlingly commanding tones.</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Styx turned to glare at Santiago, then seeming to catch some unspoken message, he slowly smiled. \u201cRight. I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d</p><p>They watched in silence as the massive vampire left the ruined room in a less dramatic fashion than Siljar. Still, it wasn\u2019t until they could sense the Anasso jogging away from the warehouse that Santiago grasped Nefri\u2019s shoulders and gently turned her to meet his somber gaze.</p><p>His lips parted, but Nefri had been waiting from the moment she\u2019d been released from control of the spirit to offer her apology.</p><p>Not that an \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d actually made up for trying to kill your lover, she wryly admitted.</p><p>\u201cSantiago,\u201d she began, only to be outmaneuvered when Santiago placed his hand over her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>She grasped his wrist to tug his hand away. \u201cBut I need to say I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow at his arrogant tone. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom this point forward, the past is done,\u201d he said, his eyes dark with a plea that tugged at her heart. \u201cThe only thing that matters is the future. Our future.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, desperately wanting to accept his offer.</p><p>How many years had she wasted with guilt and regret?</p><p>How long had she denied her emotions out of fear?</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><p>His smile held an edge of sadness that spoke of his own loss. \u201cWe\u2019ve both spent too long being haunted by events that neither of us could control.\u201d He cupped her face in his hands, his touch tender. \u201cI want a fresh start. Don\u2019t we deserve it?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if they deserved it.</p><p>Her past wasn\u2019t entirely blameless. And the gods knew that Santiago was not an innocent.</p><p>But, deserving or not, her heart urged her to snatch at the happiness with both hands.</p><p>Well, after she\u2019d tormented Santiago just a bit. He\u2019d certainly done his share of tormenting over the past weeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not entirely certain,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>His brows drew together, his struggle against his instinct to toss her over his shoulder and demand capitulation etched on his beautiful face.</p><p>Their combined arrogance and demand for control would make life together a delicious battle.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he at last rasped.</p><p>She offered a faux pout. \u201cYou hit me on the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d His frustration melted to wry amusement. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d she demanded. \u201c\u2018Yes, I know\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He reached to curl her hand into a fist, pressing his lips to her knuckles. \u201cYou can hit me on the head if you want.\u201d</p><p>She trembled, heat exploding through her veins to sear away the lingering chill from the spirit.</p><p>\u201cAs hard as your head is, it would probably break my hand,\u201d she teased, moving forward to press against his lean body.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He smiled with a wicked promise that made her toes curl in anticipation. \u201cWhich means you might as well mate with me instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes perfect sense to me.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her, studying her upturned face with a possessive satisfaction. \u201cYou and I make perfect sense to me. Be my mate.\u201d</p><p>Her heart soared, but there was one last hurdle they had to confront.</p><p>\u201cWhat about my clan?\u201d she reminded him softly. She\u2019d already prepared to step down from being chief. Her people would always have her loyalty, but nothing was more important than Santiago. \u201cEventually I\u2019ll be able to turn the leadership over to another. But for now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to choose between me and your clan, Nefri,\u201d he interrupted her, frowning as if he was baffled she would even suggest the idea.</p><p>\u201cBut your life is here.\u201d</p><p>Without warning he leaned down to kiss her with a blatant claim of ownership.</p><p>One she met with her own claim.</p><p>\u201cMy life is with you,\u201d he said against her lips.</p><p>And that\u2019s why she\u2019d bonded with this vampire out of all the thousands and thousands of men she\u2019d known over the centuries, she silently acknowledged, feeling as sappy as any overhormonal teenage girl.</p><p>He was arrogant and stubborn and possessive to the point of insanity, but he never tried to make her feel like she should apologize for her power.</p><p>He made her feel . . . proud.</p><p>Of herself. Of him. Of the partnership they were creating together.</p><p>\u201cYou could accept living beyond the Veil?\u201d she pressed, needing him to be sure.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The wicked smile widened, giving a flash of fang. \u201cI intend to open a fight club with a few fairies who know how to enjoy an orgy. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSantiago,\u201d she growled.</p><p>He chuckled, brushing his lips over her forehead. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you that you make it too easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I intend to make it very hard,\u201d she warned. \u201cMaybe if I keep you busy enough I can keep you out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>With one smooth motion he scooped her off her feet, cradling her tight against his chest as he headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cBut you like trouble,\u201d he reminded her, his expression promising all sorts of sinful havoc.</p><p>She looped her arms around his neck, the emotions she\u2019d denied for so long flowing freely through her like the finest champagne.</p><p>\u201cActually, I love trouble.\u201d</p><p>Santiago stood with Viper in the corner of Styx\u2019s formal salon.</p><p>It had been three nights since they\u2019d managed to . . . to what? He grimaced. He couldn\u2019t claim they\u2019d defeated the spirit. But at least it was contained and now in the hands of the Commission.</p><p>Since then he\u2019d devoted his time to keeping Nefri tucked in his arms. Not only because his insatiable hunger for her was a constant ache, but because he was determined to make certain she was completely recovered before returning to her duties.</p><p>Unfortunately, Nefri had decided she couldn\u2019t possibly be mated anywhere but in her private lair beyond the Veil.</p><p>So while he was fiercely happy to have her in his bed, he was growing restless to complete their mating.</p><p>Only when they\u2019d shared their blood and bonded on the most primitive level would he be satisfied.</p><p>Tonight . . .</p><p>A tingle of anticipation raced through him as he watched Nefri move through the crowd that Styx had invited to send them off to the Veil.</p><p>He would have refused Styx\u2019s offer of a party if he hadn\u2019t known that powerful vampires from around the world had flocked to the Anasso\u2019s home in the hopes of meeting the mysterious Nefri.</p><p>And if he were being perfectly honest, he enjoyed watching the guests fluttering around her in obvious awe.</p><p>She looked like the perfect ice queen dressed in a silver robe that brushed the floor and her hair falling in a river of ebony satin down her back.</p><p>Aloof and untouchable.</p><p>Until he had her alone.</p><p>Ready heat swirled through him, making him shift in discomfort.</p><p>How much longer did he have to play nice?</p><p>He\u2019d shared his beautiful mate long enough.</p><p>He was ready to get her alone.</p><p>And naked.</p><p>Definitely naked.</p><p>Perhaps sensing he needed a distraction before he went \u201ccaveman\u201d and simply hauled her off, Viper moved to stand at his side.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d his former clan chief asked, looking like a Regency dandy in his ivory velvet coat trimmed in gold thread complete with knee breeches. His long silver hair was pulled back with a matching velvet ribbon and his midnight black eyes held a lazy amusement that didn\u2019t entirely disguise his lethal power. \u201cLiving with a clan chief isn\u2019t easy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNever more sure,\u201d Santiago answered without hesitation, a smile of utter contentment curving his lips. \u201cAnd she\u2019s a very special clan chief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got me there,\u201d Viper admitted. \u201cStill . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving me in the lurch here.\u201d</p><p>Santiago laughed at his companion\u2019s petulant tone. \u201cWhy, Viper, I didn\u2019t know you cared.\u201d</p><p>Viper snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass, but you\u2019re one of the best managers I\u2019ve ever had. Who the hell is going to replace you at the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonya.\u201d</p><p>Viper hesitated, considering Santiago\u2019s recommendation with a frown. \u201cShe has the brains,\u201d he slowly conceded. \u201cBut she\u2019s distinctly lacking the brawn.\u201d</p> <p>Santiago shrugged. He didn\u2019t doubt for a minute that the shrewd imp could easily fill his shoes. And he owed her one. Not only for what had happened with Gaius, but because of the fact he\u2019d failed to realize she\u2019d hoped for more than a mere employer-employee relationship.</p><p>\u201cYou have plenty of brawn,\u201d Santiago pointed out. \u201cWhat you need is someone competent, creative, trustworthy, and capable of remaining calm when everything is going to hell.\u201d He folded his arms over his chest. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t hurt that she\u2019s beautiful enough to make grown demons beg for a smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I can give her a chance,\u201d Viper conceded.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He slapped his friend on the back. \u201cOf course, you\u2019ll need to keep an eye on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there are several other club owners who have tried to lure her away over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd without my charming presence to keep her loyal . . .\u201d</p> <p>Viper was moving toward the nearest door before Santiago could even finish.</p><p>Santiago chuckled, then sensing the approach of his soon-to-be mate, he turned to wrap an arm around her slender waist, tugging her close to his side.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>She readily leaned against him, a serene smile on her exquisite face.</p><p>\u201cWhy was Viper scowling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness.\u201d</p><p>She gave an absent nod, clearly something on her mind. \u201cSantiago . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to miss the club,\u201d he interrupted her, stealing a swift kiss. Just because he could. \u201cAnd before you start worrying about my brothers, I intend to return and visit if and when I find myself missing them.\u201d He gazed deep into her eyes, allowing her to see the love that consumed him. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not busy with my new family.\u201d</p> <p>A smile brighter than the sun spread across her face, her hand reaching to grab his fingers in a tight grip. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you?\u201d He held her tight as the world began to melt away. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Roke drained his glass of blood as he watched Santiago and Nefri disappear from view.</p><p>About fucking time.</p><p>Styx had commanded that he attend the stupid party, despite his foul mood.</p><p>His duty was now officially done.</p><p>Setting aside his glass, Roke was on the point of slipping through a side door when the cool wash of power warned him of his Anasso\u2019s approach.</p><p>\u201cRoke,\u201d Styx drawled. \u201cSurely you\u2019re not going to run away so soon?\u201d</p><p>Forced to halt, Roke scowled at his king, who was wearing a white silk shirt and black dress pants that didn\u2019t make him any more civilized than usual.</p><p>Not that Roke had any room to judge fashion. He was wearing his customary jeans, leather jacket, and knee-high moccasins.</p><p>\u201cI told you I didn\u2019t want to come.\u201d</p><p>Styx smiled, lifting his glass to sip the expensive cognac.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that as soon as Sally is feeling up to traveling you\u2019re free to go in search of her father.\u201d</p><p>Roke\u2019s scowl deepened.</p><p>Pleased?</p><p>Of course he should be pleased.</p><p>He should be dancing with joy.</p><p>He\u2019d been straining at the leash to leave this damned lair so he could track down Sally\u2019s father. How else could he break the mating?</p><p>But strangely, he\u2019d devoted the past three days to ignoring Sally\u2019s pleas to be released so she could begin the hunt, telling himself she was too weak to risk leaving.</p><p>He\u2019d also assured himself that his hesitation had nothing to do with his growing bond with the female and everything to do with the agony of watching her lie as still as death after her battle with the spirit.</p><p>Twelve hours, sixteen minutes, and thirty seconds.</p><p>That was how long she\u2019d been unconscious. He\u2019d counted every tick of the clock as he stood guard by her bed. He wasn\u2019t going through that again.</p><p>Period.</p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d he growled.</p><p>Styx shrugged. \u201cI think we can safely assume that you\u2019ve fulfilled your part in Cassie\u2019s vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d he muttered before giving a shake of his head. \u201cI can\u2019t leave yet. Sally is still weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed fine earlier this evening,\u201d Styx said, his expression suspiciously bland. \u201cIn fact, she came to me to ask for permission to go.\u201d</p><p>Roke\u2019s muscles clenched. Sally had gone to Styx behind his back?</p><p>She was his mate.</p><p>Any discussion of when they would leave and where they would go would be between the two of them.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a female who too often thinks on impulse rather than reason,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>Styx narrowed his eyes. \u201cAll the more reason to get on with finding a way to break the mating.\u201d</p><p>Roke barely swallowed his growl. \u201cI won\u2019t drag a barely conscious female around the countryside without even a clue to where we should start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Styx unexpectedly conceded, his smile worrisome. \u201cThen perhaps you want to return to your clan? Sally is welcome to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even . . .\u201d Roke forgot how to speak as his connection to Sally was abruptly stretched. Just like that. One minute she\u2019d been upstairs and the next she was halfway across the country. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Shoving his way through the crowd, Roke hit the hallway at a dead run.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Styx demanded, easily keeping pace as Roke headed up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cSally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d Styx\u2019s power rattled the paintings on the wall. \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>Roke turned down the hall leading to Sally\u2019s private rooms. \u201cI know when my mate has disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could never have gotten past the guards,\u201d Styx growled, tossing aside the unfortunate vampire who stepped out of his room to see what was going on.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a witch,\u201d Roke reminded him, torn between anger and concern. There was nothing in their bond to indicate she was afraid or hurt. Which meant that she\u2019d probably plotted this abrupt departure. Still, that didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t in danger. Dammit. He should have locked her in the dungeons. \u201cA very powerful witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house has been hexed to prevent magic,\u201d Styx argued, clearly disturbed by the thought that anyone could slip past his defenses.</p><p>\u201cShe did not use magic,\u201d an aggravatingly familiar voice said as the tiny gargoyle stepped out of Sally\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cLevet, now isn\u2019t the time,\u201d Roke snarled, needing to locate Sally\u2019s trail so he could begin the hunt.</p><p>\u201cYou will desire to hear what I have to say,\u201d Levet insisted. \u201cI know where Sally is.\u201d</p><p>Roke halted, reaching down to grasp the gargoyle by the horn. He lifted him until they were eye to eye. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>The fairy wings fluttered in protest, but the gargoyle was smart enough not to press Roke\u2019s temper.</p><p>\u201cI do not know the precise location.\u201d</p><p>The floor rumbled beneath their feet. \u201cLevet, unless you want to become a wall ornament, you\u2019ll tell me exactly what you know.\u201d A hall table tumbled sideways, smashing the priceless vase into a thousand pieces. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asked Yannah to help her escape,\u201d Levet said, his voice several octaves higher than usual.</p><p>\u201cEscape?\u201d Roke\u2019s brows snapped together. \u201cShe was a guest, not a prisoner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she did not recognize the distinction.\u201d</p><p>Roke dropped the beast, disliking the guilt that sliced through his heart.</p><p>He\u2019d only been trying to protect her.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>Thrusting aside the worthless questions, he forced himself to swallow his pride. He could feel Sally, but she was too distant to pinpoint her direction.</p><p>\u201cCan you follow them?\u201d he forced himself to ask the gargoyle.</p><p>\u201cSally? Sadly no.\u201d Levet wrinkled his tiny snout. \u201cBut Yannah. Oui. I can follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019ll take my bike.\u201d</p><p>Styx reached out to grab his arm. \u201cRoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he snapped, not bothering to hide his impatience. Every minute apart was another minute that Sally could be hurt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cBe careful.
