My eyelids wanted to stay closed; my favorite jeans were in the hamper; and there was no milk in the fridge.</p> <p>Worst of all, my cell phone was dead: the shiny, candy red one that I\u2019ll have until it falls into a gutter; the one that has the calendar and reminder bells and is essentially my portable, socially acceptable security blanket.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d my mom said during the drive to school this morning.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I asked. \u201cI could have a huge math test today. There could be a school assembly that I won\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one day, London. You\u2019ll be fine without your phone for one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d I muttered, looking out the window.</p> <p>Now, right now, standing here, I have proof that my mom was wrong. I am not fine without my phone for one day.</p><p>Today is the day that I needed a new T-shirt for gym class. Had it not been dead, my phone, the phone my mom and I programmed together at the start of the year with important little reminders like this one, would have instructed me, in its tiny block lettering, to bring a shirt for Phys. Ed. today.</p><p>Therefore, today is the day I\u2019m standing in gym shorts and my winter sweater, wondering what to do.</p><p>I can\u2019t very well wear a sweater for basketball (which is what we\u2019re playing, according to the board near the locker room door), so I ask Page if she has an extra top. We won\u2019t ever really be friends, but she still responds overenthusiastically. \u201cSure, London, here you go. Forgot your clean shirt again, huh?\u201d</p><p>Again?</p><p>I make a mental note to jot myself a real note later, while at the same time wondering why today\u2019s note didn\u2019t mention bringing a gym shirt.</p> <p>Page interrupts my train of thought. She smiles and hands me a bright yellow oversized tee with a beaming cat on it that reads: HAVE A PURR-FECT DAY!</p><p>\u201cThanks, Page,\u201d I grumble as I take the shirt from her and quickly put it on. It nearly covers the shorts\u2014shorts!\u2014that I\u2019m already wearing. Why my locker contained shorts and not some other warmer, cuter piece of bottom-covering sportswear, I have no clue.</p><p>Note to self: add \u201cbring pants\u201d to note to self, too.</p><p>I feel like Page is watching me. I glance at her and, yep, she\u2019s watching me. We exchange pleasant nods before I throw my street clothes into the locker, slam it, and head out to the gym.</p><p>As I walk, two thoughts run through my mind. First, I wonder whether Ms. Martinez will let me go to the nurse\u2019s office for a Band-Aid to cover the painful heel blister that I can feel grating against my sneaker with every step. And, second, I can\u2019t help but thank my lucky stars that only the twelve other hapless souls with first-period gym class will see me in this hideous ensemble.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, Ms. Martinez is a coldhearted woman.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says, when I ask to go to the nurse\u2019s office before the game begins.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I ask in disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says again, black eyes daring me to argue. She holds her whistle at the ready.</p><p>I\u2019m not stupid, so I don\u2019t press the issue. Instead, I hobble back to the bench, join my teammates, and vow to play through the pain.</p><p>Then halfway through what I can only assume is the lowest-scoring basketball game in high school sports history, a noise ricochets through the echoing gym that all at once makes my arm hairs stand on end, my eardrums seize up, and my teeth chatter.</p><p>For a moment, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.</p><p>Ms. Martinez waves her arms in the direction of the exit, and my classmates begin lazily walking toward the doorway.</p><p>That\u2019s when I get it.</p><p>We are having a fire drill.</p><p>We, the students of Meridan High School, are going outside. All 956 of us. While I, London Lane, am sporting a bright yellow cat T-shirt that says HAVE A PURR-FECT DAY! and too-short shorts for the entire student body to enjoy.</p><p>Yep, it\u2019s a good Friday indeed.</p><p>2</p><p>The gymnasium is close to an exit, so we\u2019re among the first to make it to the safety of the faculty parking lot. Surrounded by the odd assortment of vehicles, from a station wagon here to a cherry red Porsche there, I watch apathetic students saunter out of the concrete block that is our high school, as if they\u2019re impervious to fire.</p><p>Not that I believe there\u2019s a fire.</p><p>My guess is that some moron pulled the alarm to be funny, not having the foresight to realize that he or she would then be forced to stand in the cold for an hour while waiting for the fire trucks to arrive and the firemen to clear the building and finally make the screeching alarm stop.</p><p>It\u2019s windy, and I think I see snow flurries. With every gust, I pull myself tighter into a ball to try to stay warm.</p><p>It\u2019s not working.</p><p>I yank my hair out of its messy knot at the nape of my neck, hoping it will act as a scarf. Immediately, the wind sets flight to my bright auburn locks, and I am both blinded and repeatedly face-whipped.</p><p>As the hordes of students gather, I hear whispers and chuckles, presumably about my outfit. I swear I hear the click of a camera phone, but by the time I peer through my wild mane, the photographer has hidden the evidence. Still, the trace of giggling from the inside of a tight circle of cheerleaders makes me nervous.</p><p>I stare at their backs until Alex Morgan whips her head of shiny black hair in my direction and locks eyes with me. She looks like she took time to apply an extra layer of jet-black eyeliner before evacuating the building.</p><p>Priorities.</p><p>Alex smirks at me and turns back to the huddle, and more giggles erupt from it.</p><p>At this moment, I wish for my best friend, Jamie. The girl has her faults, but she\u2019ll never back down from a cheerleader\u2019s slams.</p><p>Alone with my bare legs and purr-fect T-shirt, I hear bits and pieces of conversations about weekend plans, the \u201ctest we\u2019re missing right now,\u201d and \u201clet\u2019s just take off and drive to Reggie\u2019s for breakfast, since we\u2019re already out here.\u201d I hug my arms to my torso even tighter, partially to shield myself from the weather and partially to obscure the cat.</p><p>\u201cNice T-shirt,\u201d says a smooth male voice, with just a touch of mockery. Using my left hand as a makeshift ponytail holder, I grab all the hair I can catch and turn in the direction of the voice.</p><p>And then time stops.</p><p>I see the smile first. There is an unmistakable sweetness peeking through the teasing. My armor begins to crumble before I\u2019ve made my way up to the eyes; what\u2019s left of it melts away at the sight of them. Sparkling pale cornflower blue with darker flecks, surrounded by eyelashes any girl would envy.</p><p>Looking at me.</p><p>Right at me.</p><p>Even more than his mouth, his eyes are smiling.</p><p>If there was something near me\u2014a piece of furniture, even a nonhostile person\u2014I might reach out and physically steady myself because I feel off balance in his presence. In a good way.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>And then it\u2019s all gone. The shirt, the phone, basketball, Alex Morgan.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing but the boy before me.</p><p>He looks like he belongs in either Hollywood or heaven. I could stare at him all day.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say after who knows how long. I force myself to blink. His face looks familiar somehow, but only in the way that I want it to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wait, do I remember him?</p><p>Please, oh please, oh please let me remember him.</p><p>I thumb through years and years of faces in the album in my brain. This face is nowhere to be found.</p><p>For a glimmer of a second, I\u2019m sad about that fact. Then my optimistic side springs forth. I\u2019m probably wrong. He has to be in there somewhere.</p> <p>Where were we? Oh, the outfit...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting a new trend,\u201d I joke.</p><p>I shift my body so that the wind blows my hair out of my eyes; I force myself to notice something other than his.</p><p>\u201cI like your shoes,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cUh, thanks,\u201d he says awkwardly as he, too, looks down at his chocolate brown Converse All Stars. With not much left to say about shoes, he unzips and removes his tan hoodie.</p> <p>Before I know what\u2019s happening, he\u2019s draping it around my shoulders and it\u2019s like I\u2019m protected from the world, not just the elements. The fleece lining is warm from his body and smells faintly of soap and fabric softener and just... guy. A perfect kind of guy.</p><p>He\u2019s standing a little close to me for being a stranger, now in just his own T-shirt. It looks vintage; I\u2019ve never heard of the band.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say again, as if it\u2019s one of only ten words I know in the English language. \u201cBut aren\u2019t you cold?\u201d</p><p>He laughs, as though that\u2019s the most ridiculous question in the world, and says, simply, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t guys be cold?</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well, thanks,\u201d I say, for the millionth time in two seconds.</p> <p>What is it with me and that word?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really no problem,\u201d he says. \u201cI figured you could use it. You\u2019re turning blue,\u201d he adds, nodding toward my legs. \u201cI\u2019m Luke, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon,\u201d is all I can manage.</p><p>\u201cCool name,\u201d he says with an easy smile. I can see a hint of a dimple in one of his cheeks. \u201cMemorable,\u201d he adds. Very funny, I think.</p><p>A shriek pulls me from my Luke-induced trance.</p><p>\u201cLondon, WHAT are you wearing?\u201d Jamie Connor screams so loudly that at least five people stop their conversations and turn toward us. \u201cPlease tell me you have pants on.\u201d</p><p>I take back my wish for her to appear. She can go away now.</p><p>\u201cShhh, Jamie, people are staring,\u201d I say, pulling her close to me to try to shut her up. I can smell the perfume that my best friend will wear forever.</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you\u2019re kind of a disaster,\u201d she adds with a little laugh. I frown at her.</p><p>\u201cBad morning?\u201d she asks, looping her arm through mine.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I answer quietly, still very aware that Luke is nearby. \u201cI forgot my gym shirt. Again.\u201d</p><p>Jamie gives me a sympathetic shoulder nudge before changing the subject. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to ask who lent you that one. Have you seen Anthony out here?\u201d she asks as she searches the crowd. But then her interest in Anthony comes to a screeching halt when she spots Luke. My Luke.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says to him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says back. He refuses to look right at Jamie; I might like it a little.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asks, head cocked like a curious cat.</p><p>\u201cLuke Henry,\u201d he says, finally focusing on her for a blink. \u201cIt\u2019s my first day.\u201d He looks away again and scans the crowd, as if he\u2019s grown tired of being where he is. I notice that he keeps his head low, like he doesn\u2019t want to attract attention.</p><p>Jamie is not used to boys looking away, and, frankly, with the short skirt and tight top she\u2019s wearing, I\u2019m surprised by Luke\u2019s disinterest. She shifts her weight, pops a hip, and continues.</p><p>\u201cWhat year are you?\u201d Jamie asks.</p><p>\u201cJunior,\u201d Luke answers.</p><p>\u201cCool. Us, too,\u201d she says. I think she might be finished with the questions, but no such luck. \u201cSo, why start on a Friday?\u201d</p><p>Luke glances at Jamie, then his eyes find mine and there it is again.</p><p>He\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have anything better to do today,\u201d he says matter-of-factly. \u201cWe were unpacked. Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see... and where did you come from?\u201d</p><p>Make it stop!</p><p>\u201cI just moved here from Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have an accent,\u201d Jamie points out.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t born there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d Jamie says as she flips her blonde hair out of her eyes. It\u2019s one of her signature moves\u2014one she\u2019ll do in college and beyond\u2014and, best friend or not, my claws are out.</p><p>My posture has obviously stiffened, because Jamie pulls back a little from me to examine my face. She looks at Luke, then back at me again.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she grumbles, and I\u2019m terrified that she is going to state the obvious, but instead, she continues the third degree. \u201cWell, where were you before Boston\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jamie is interrupted by the sudden, quiet calm. Alarm under control, Principal Flowers grabs his bullhorn and herds us back inside in a tone that says he loathes every waking minute spent in our presence.</p><p>Jamie and I look at each other, then burst out laughing at the booming voice coming from tiny Principal Flowers. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019m laughing about.</p><p>When we recover, I look back at Luke. Well, I want to look back at Luke.</p><p>But he\u2019s gone.</p><p>I pan the crowd furiously, but all that stands out in the sea of drab colors are bright red, white, and black cheerleading sweaters. Definitely not what I\u2019m looking for. I feel myself beginning to panic, in that way you do when you lose something you really love, like a favorite watch or pen or pair of jeans.</p><p>We\u2019re moving now, Jamie and I, arm in arm. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s why I\u2019m moving: because Jamie is pulling me forward.</p><p>Finally, I see it.</p><p>My insides do cartwheels when I spy Luke\u2019s T-shirt making its way toward the building. His head hangs low and he walks slowly but with purpose, conveying untouchable coolness. I am thrilled by the sight of him, but then disappointed.</p><p>How could he just walk away like that?</p><p>We had a moment, didn\u2019t we?</p><p>We had a moment, he lent me his hoodie, and he left. And now, he\u2019s walking back to class like nothing happened. Like he never met an interesting, albeit vertically challenged, redhead.</p><p>We had a moment, and now Luke Henry from Boston is over it, and I\u2019m gripping my best friend\u2019s arm so tightly at the sight of his backside that said best friend gives me a look and twists her arm free.</p><p>All at once, my morning dips again, and I feel lower than I did when I discovered that my cell phone was dead. Funny how possibility can lift you. Funny how reality can slam you down.</p><p>I watch Luke\u2019s back from twenty feet behind as he strides down the PE corridor, past the locker rooms and the Driver\u2019s Education and ROTC classrooms, and toward the commons. It\u2019s as if nothing happened. Nothing at all. And who knows? Maybe it didn\u2019t.</p><p>But as Luke Henry rounds the corner and slips out of view, there is one thing I know for sure. One thing that gives me a glimmer of a shard of a bit of hope that we\u2019ll see each other again.</p><p>I\u2019m still wearing his sweatshirt.</p><p>\u201cGood day today?\u201d Mom asks when I jump into the Prius.</p><p>\u201cIt was okay,\u201d I say, turning on the radio. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou seem to have survived without your cell phone. Anything interesting happen?\u201d She drives us out of the school lot and turns toward home.</p><p>Shrugging, I say, \u201cA new guy started today.\u201d</p><p>My mom glances in my direction, then faces forward. I can tell she\u2019s trying not to smile, but her efforts aren\u2019t working.</p><p>\u201cA cute guy?\u201d she asks. I can\u2019t help but smile, too.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to him?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cA little. We had a fire drill and we ended up standing near each other. He\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d</p> <p>My mom is quiet a moment, probably sensing that I\u2019m about to put an end to the conversation. But then, nosy as she will always be, she can\u2019t resist one more question.</p><p>\u201cWas he in your notes this morning?\u201d she asks casually. I consider changing the subject or cranking up the radio even louder, but since she\u2019s one of two people I can talk to about my condition, I turn to face her in my seat and answer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s weird!\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asks excitedly.</p><p>\u201cWell, he wasn\u2019t in my notes this morning, but I had this whole conversation with him and everything,\u201d I say. \u201cIt was bizarre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you just forgot to mention him,\u201d Mom offers. We\u2019re turning into our development now. I shake my head.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say, not wanting to discuss him anymore. In truth, I know there\u2019s no way I would forget to mention Luke Henry.</p><p>We\u2019re almost home when my mom\u2019s cell phone rings from the center compartment. \u201cSorry, honey, I\u2019ve got to grab this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d I say, happy to be left alone to daydream.</p><p>In the middle of the night, pen in hand, the hope seeps out of me. Luke\u2019s hoodie is in the laundry, but his face is almost gone. For three hours, I\u2019ve tried to attach him to my forward memories. I\u2019ve quizzed myself: Do we share a class? Will we go out? Will I know him for years to come? But with the clock counting down to 4:33 AM\u2014the time when my mind resets and my memory is wiped clean\u2014I have to admit that Luke Henry is nowhere to be found.</p><p>He\u2019s not in my memory, which means he\u2019s not in my future.</p><p>When I finally accept it, the truth stings. But there\u2019s no time to dwell on it, and there are only two choices: I can remind myself about someone who is not a part of my life, or I can leave him out of my notes to save myself from going through this all over again tomorrow.</p><p>This late, with my mind just minutes from \u201creset,\u201d it doesn\u2019t seem much of a choice at all. I grit my teeth and grip the pen and do what I have to do.</p><p>I lie to myself.</p> <p>3</p><p>The house is still; it\u2019s early.</p><p>I check out the bedroom, trying to pinpoint differences between two nearly identical pictures: the one I remember from tomorrow and the scene before me now.</p><p>There\u2019s an empty mug with a used tea bag wound around the handle on a coaster on the desk. There\u2019s a sweatshirt hanging over the edge of the hamper like it\u2019s trying to get out. Tomorrow, the mug will be gone. There will be textbooks on the desk; the hamper will be empty.</p><p>I hold a note that explains what I\u2019ve missed. Well, at least the highlights.</p><p>10/17 (Sun.)</p><p>Outfit:</p><p>\u2014Supersoft boy\u2019s hoodie (Fri. note said I got it from the reject pile at school)</p><p>\u2014Black leggings</p><p>\u2014Sherpa boots</p><p>School:</p><p>\u2014Bring Band-Aids for almost-healed blister</p><p>\u2014Bring yoga pants, T-shirt for gym (had to borrow awful clothes from Page Fri.)</p><p>\u2014CELL PHONE (Mom has it in the car)</p><p>Other stuff:</p><p>\u2014J was in L.A. this weekend w/her dad</p><p>\u2014Avoid Page this week</p><p>\u2014Doctor this morning (tripped Fri. in PE)</p><p>I set aside the note and read through similar messages from the past week, paying particular attention to Friday\u2019s comments on clothes and school stuff. Then, still feeling like I\u2019m walking into the world partially blind, I haul myself from bed and start the day.</p><p>On the way to the doctor\u2019s office, Mom takes Hudson Avenue, which cuts through the city cemetery. At the intersection of Hudson and Washington, we get caught at the light.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be late,\u201d my mom mutters under her breath. She drums her hands on the wheel, and I wonder if she\u2019s missing a meeting to drive me.</p><p>I loll my head to the right side and scan the graves. They stand in formation, lines running straight away from me and then curving slightly in the distance.</p><p>The light turns green, and as the car speeds up, a movement catches my eye. Two people, a man and a boy, stop before a tombstone. In my rational brain, I know they\u2019re visiting a lost loved one. Nothing scary. But something about the mourners makes my shoulders tense and sends a shot of electricity through my body. I shiver in my seat; my mother doesn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what you\u2019re going to say when the doctor asks how this happened?\u201d Mom asks, interrupting my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I reply, grateful for the distraction. \u201cI tripped over a ball in gym class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says as we turn into the parking lot. She finds a space and we rush inside. We clear the lobby quickly and then ride the elevator up two floors in silence. All the while, my mind is still in the graveyard.</p><p>4</p><p>\u201cDoctor\u2019s appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I say, smiling my most innocent smile at Henne Fassbinder, school secretary and obvious lover of cats.</p><p>She frowns in response as she types something into my computer file with nails so long they\u2019d have to open a soda can sideways.</p><p>I hop a little, hoping she\u2019ll hurry up. I want to get to my locker before class lets out\u2014fewer opportunities for mistakes that way.</p><p>\u201cIn a hurry?\u201d Henne asks.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I say, trying another smile. She frowns again.</p><p>Finally, Ms. Fassbinder finishes typing and shoves back in her swivel chair. She opens a cabinet and easily locates the file with my name on it and then inserts the note my mom wrote just minutes ago.</p><p>I assume that Ms. Fassbinder will wait until I\u2019m gone to compare today\u2019s handwriting with that from previous days.</p><p>Turning around, I check the industrial clock mounted on the wall behind me. It\u2019s 9:52 AM. The bell will ring in three minutes, and I\u2019m nervous about that, for some reason. I\u2019ve missed PE, study hall, and Pre-calc. Not bad.</p><p>Finally, the secretary offers me a hall pass and I take it, but not before noticing the tiny decorative cats affixed to her nails. It looks like they were innocently walking through bright red cement when it set and trapped them forever.</p><p>Poor cats.</p><p>I hoist my bag onto my right shoulder and bolt from the office. I speed walk across the commons\u2014ignoring the \u201cbadly bruised\u201d ankle noted on my doctor\u2019s excuse\u2014and start up the main hallway bordering the library. Halfway there, the end-of-third-period bell rings and I\u2019m swimming upstream through distracted students, hand-holding couples, and ironclad cliques.</p><p>I try to avoid eye contact with everyone, but sometimes it\u2019s impossible. Page Thomas, looking like a D-list celebrity on her stylist\u2019s day off, approaches from the opposite direction and waves at me with what I consider to be a little too much enthusiasm. For a beat, I have no idea why she\u2019s so happy to see me. I shift my bag to my left arm so that I can cordially wave back as we pass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then I remember.</p><p>Soon she will corner me and ask me to set her up with Brad, from math. Ugh. Who am I, Cupid?</p><p>Where the main hall intersects with the pathways to the math and science wings, Carley Lynch and her circle have the hallway blocked. They\u2019re all in black and red uniforms, and a few squad members are actually taking notes as Carley speaks.</p><p>As I pass by, I notice a little Tigers mascot temporary tattoo high on Carley\u2019s perfect right cheekbone. I imagine her staring in her mirror this morning before school, trying to get the tattoo just so, which makes me giggle to myself.</p> <p>Carley sees my expression and her eyes narrow. She makes a show of scrutinizing my outfit, then proclaims, \u201cHey, loser, props on getting yourself into a semidecent outfit today. Did you buy it at Kmart?\u201d</p><p>Clueless as to where my clothes come from or why Carley hates me so much, I feel a lump rise in my throat. Even though I have the benefit of knowing that I\u2019ll grow more beautiful each day\u2014and that Carley will never look better than she does right now\u2014the comment stings. Just when I think I might lose it in front of the cheerleader cult, someone grabs my hand.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Jamie says softly before pulling me around the squad to my locker.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d I say quietly. Jamie shakes her head as she opens my locker door for me. I unload my book bag and take deep breaths in an effort to brush it off. While I do, Jamie leans against the locker next to mine, looking alarmingly like a hooker.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ma,\u201d Jason Rodriguez says to Jamie as he passes. \u201cNice legs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she says back with a twinkle in her eyes.</p><p>I look at my friend, thinking that I both admire her and worry about her, despite knowing how things will turn out. Jamie is effortlessly surfer-girl pretty, even though she\u2019ll never hit the waves. Her chin-length dark blonde hair looks like she washed it in salt water and then let it dry in the warm sun, and her eyes are ocean green. She\u2019s stick-model thin, tanned, and sporting bare legs under a very short skirt with no tights. In October.</p><p>Down the hall, Jason high-fives his friend; I don\u2019t even want to know if it was about Jamie.</p><p>Jamie will always be that girl: the one boys love to flirt with\u2014not date\u2014and girls love to hate. And I will always be that girl\u2019s only friend.</p><p>\u201cHow did it go at the doctor?\u201d Jamie asks. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you fell again. You\u2019re such a klutz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha,\u201d I say sarcastically. \u201cThe doctor was fine. He didn\u2019t ask much so I didn\u2019t have to lie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, retrieving my Spanish book. \u201cHow\u2019s your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst!\u201d Jamie begins as I slam my locker shut. \u201cI got detention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a History test and I didn\u2019t study, so I gave Ryan Greene\u2019s paper a tiny peek, and all of a sudden, Mr. Burgess was standing over me. Anyway, detention starts at the ungodly hour of seven in the morning, and I have to go for like two weeks. Doesn\u2019t that seem a little unfair to you?\u201d</p><p>Not waiting for me to respond, she continues. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where detention is. I guess I better figure that out before seven tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Jamie is quiet for a second, and then something pops into her brain.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she says, hitting me softly on the arm. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you warn me about Mr. Burgess? About getting caught? You had to see that one coming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t,\u201d I say, shrugging. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t in my note this morning. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Jamie says. \u201cAfter tomorrow, I\u2019ll no longer be a detention virgin.\u201d</p><p>We laugh, but there\u2019s a pit in my stomach. This won\u2019t be the last time Jamie will see the inside of the detention hall. However, it will be the first time she\u2019ll flirt with the detention hall monitor, Mr. Rice, and the beginning of a sordid affair that will end in his divorce and Jamie\u2019s being sent to an all-girls\u2019 camp this summer to learn the difference between right and wrong, with the help of poetry, pottery, and Jesus.</p><p>I shake it off and Jamie rattles on while we move toward Spanish. We\u2019re nearly the same height today because I\u2019m in high boots, but she walks taller, with confidence, and meets the eyes of passing students. I watch their shoes as they go by, imagining who might be wearing them.</p><p>White cross-trainers with laces and swoosh that exactly match the school\u2019s crimson?</p><p>Too easy.</p><p>Cheerleader.</p><p>Adidas tennis shoes with athletic socks?</p><p>Male soccer player in the off-season (noticed the hairy legs).</p><p>Are those bedroom slippers? Come on.</p><p>Ooh, here come some cute red boots. They\u2019re Western meets modern, and I want to borrow them. Who could it be? Maybe next year\u2019s homecoming queen, Lisa Something? She\u2019s trendy.</p><p>Unable to stand the suspense, I look up to find that I\u2019m wrong. The girl in the boots is Hannah Wright. I can\u2019t help but smile, because Hannah\u2019s future is bright: in just a few years, she\u2019ll be a country superstar.</p><p>Too bad I can\u2019t tell her.</p><p>Back to my game, I see brown Converse All Stars coming toward me\u2014actually head-on toward me\u2014but before impact or identification, Jamie tugs me out of the way. We\u2019ve made it to the Spanish corridor.</p><p>\u201cWere you playing that stupid foot game again?\u201d she asks, dropping my arm.</p><p>I shrug in response.</p><p>\u201cWell, you should watch where you\u2019re going. You almost got run down by that weirdo,\u201d she says as we walk into Ms. Garcia\u2019s classroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat weirdo?\u201d I ask, intrigued. This morning\u2019s note mentioned nothing about a weirdo.</p><p>\u201cThat weird guy you were talking to during the fire drill. Jake. No, Jack. Lance? Whatever. You know, the guy who just moved here. He looked like he wanted to talk to you just now, but you were too busy looking at his feet. It doesn\u2019t matter, because you shouldn\u2019t be associating with weirdos. You\u2019re already weird enough as is.\u201d</p><p>Jamie turns and gives me a silly grin before the bell rings and ends our conversation.</p><p>When Ms. Garcia grabs a dry-erase marker and begins writing today\u2019s class agenda, I lean over and whisper gently to my best friend.</p><p>\u201cJamie, you look pretty today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, London,\u201d she says with a soft smile before turning in her seat toward Anthony Olsen, who is very openly eyeballing her legs.</p><p>5</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a dream: I wasn\u2019t asleep.</p><p>Almost, but not quite.</p><p>There, in that space between resting and REM, the image slammed into my head like a freight train. Now I\u2019m sitting up straight, blinking furiously as if that will make my eyes adjust more quickly, breathing heavily, and sweating even though the heater\u2019s turned down low, as it will be every night for as long as I live here.</p><p>Like that gory photo in my Anatomy book that I\u2019ll encounter in a few months and can\u2019t stop thinking about already, the memory won\u2019t go away.</p><p>I want to walk down the hall and crawl into bed with my mom.</p><p>Instead, I try to self-soothe.</p><p>I take at least five deep, calming breaths, maybe more. I identify every dark shape in the room as nonthreatening. Finally, I burrow back inside the still-warm cocoon between two oversized pillows that form an upside-down V at the top of my bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Feeling a little better, I trick my brain into thinking about other things. The annoying doctor this morning; Jamie flirting with Jason; Jamie flirting with Anthony. White shoes, red boots, silly slippers, black shoes, brown sneakers...</p><p>Wham!</p><p>My eyes are open wide once more.</p><p>I try shaking my head. I try thinking of the shoes again. I even try thinking of other unpleasant thoughts, like Jamie\u2019s upcoming... situation.</p> <p>Nothing works.</p><p>Exhaling loudly, I decide to let my mind go. Trying not to think about it is only making it worse.</p><p>I pull the blankets up to my chin and blink into the pitch-black bedroom.</p><p>And suddenly, I\u2019m in a cemetery.</p><p>Being there makes me shiver now.</p> <p>I\u2019m at a funeral. At least I think I am.</p><p>I can\u2019t distinguish much except for hazy black shapes that could be people, and neutral stone beyond them in every direction. In my nostrils: the unmistakable scent of fresh-cut grass. It could be 8:30 AM or 3:14 PM. It\u2019s overcast: I can\u2019t tell.</p><p>I don\u2019t understand the scene, but it makes me feel heavy just the same.</p><p>And alone.</p><p>And afraid.</p><p>I consider whether to turn on the lamp and add details of this memory to today\u2019s note\u2014right underneath musings about the \u201cweirdo\u201d that Jamie mentioned\u2014but, ultimately, I stay where I am.</p> <p>It\u2019s obvious that the mourners today triggered this particular memory. But knowing why doesn\u2019t soften the blow of the harsh underlying reality.</p><p>I remember forward.</p><p>I remember forward, and forget backward.</p><p>My memories, bad, boring, or good, haven\u2019t happened yet.</p><p>So, like it or not\u2014and like it I don\u2019t\u2014I will remember standing in the fresh-cut grass with the black-clad figures surrounded by stone until I do it for real. I will remember the funeral until it happens\u2014until someone dies.</p><p>And after that, it will be forgotten.</p><p>6</p><p>I\u2019m early to study hall.</p> <p>I changed out of my gym clothes quickly in order to dodge Page Thomas\u2019s simple request, which is silly, because I remember when it\u2019ll happen... not today. But still, I rushed. I skipped the pointless trip to my locker near the math corridor and, voil\u00e0! Here I am.</p><p>Early.</p><p>This must be out of character for me, because Ms. Mason is eyeing me like I\u2019m something disgusting she\u2019s been asked to ingest. I smile at her, and she looks away.</p><p>More students arrive. I take the Pre-calc. textbook and workbook from my bag, as well as a red mechanical pencil. Thankfully, none of the other students sit at my table, so I can spread out.</p><p>I begin the homework that this morning\u2019s note said I neglected to do last night. The other students are chatting among themselves, getting in those last bits of gossip before the bell rings.</p><p>\u201cWe meet again,\u201d says a smooth male voice out of nowhere.</p><p>I figure he\u2019s talking to someone at the next table, but I look up from my work anyway.</p><p>Then I suck in my breath.</p><p>The boy standing there across the table, looking like he\u2019s going to sit down with me, is flat-out gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cHi?\u201d I say, more question than greeting.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had study hall this period,\u201d the boy says, casually dropping his bag onto a chair and pulling out the one beside it. He sits down, his eyes never leaving mine.</p><p>Do I know him?</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d I say back, which comes out sounding a little snippy because I\u2019m preoccupied.</p><p>Am I in the right place?</p><p>I scan the faces of my classmates. Andy Bernstein. Check. Hannah Wright. Check.</p><p>Tomorrow is Wednesday, so today is Tuesday. Check.</p><p>Second period?</p><p>Yep, I just had PE.</p><p>The boy is talking again.</p><p>\u201c... because after the fire drill I had to finish orientation, and it took up all of second period, too. But you weren\u2019t here yesterday. Where were you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m tapping my pencil on my notebook now. This conversation is making me anxious. I think back to my notes before answering.</p><p>\u201cAt a doctor\u2019s appointment,\u201d I say, adding no additional clarification.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d the boy says, glancing down at the table for a moment. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to pry.\u201d</p><p>He looks embarrassed. It\u2019s cute.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I say, still tapping my pencil. \u201cI tripped over a ball in gym. My mom thought my ankle was sprained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, just bruised,\u201d I say.</p><p>I\u2019m tapping faster now.</p><p>He\u2019s still looking right at me.</p><p>Right into me.</p><p>Seriously, do I know him?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he says. The bell rings and we\u2019re still staring at each other, him looking amused and me probably looking like I\u2019m going to explode. At least that\u2019s how I feel.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks, with the slightest nod in the direction of my furiously tapping pencil. The acknowledgment of my nervous energy makes me fumble; I lose my grip, and the pencil launches into the air and then falls onto the floor. Feeling like a complete idiot, I scoot back in my chair and bend over to retrieve it. I grab the pencil, and, on my way back up, I spy something interesting.</p><p>Chocolate brown Converse All Stars.</p><p>My heart leaps as I remember this morning\u2019s note. This boy is my weirdo.</p><p>My weirdo is hot.</p><p>Somehow I manage to sit straight and scoot back to the table without completely humiliating myself. I smile at him. He smiles back, and I smile more.</p><p>\u201cSo, you stole my sweatshirt, you know,\u201d he says with a glint in his eye. \u201cYou can borrow it for a while, as long as you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d Evil Eye Mason interrupts with a sharp whisper from her perch.</p><p>\u201c... promise to...\u201d Weirdo attempts to continue in a whisper before Ms. Mason smacks her palm on her desk.</p><p>\u201cMr. Henry!\u201d she shouts. Weirdo\u2019s mouth slams shut, and he grudgingly looks her way. I\u2019m happy to know at least part of his name.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI should hope so. You\u2019re new, so I\u2019ll give you a pass this one time. But understand, son, there is no talking in my classroom. This is a time for studying. Quietly. This is not social hour.\u201d</p><p>A couple of the other girls giggle softly. Ms. Mason kills their giggles with a glance. She reminds me of a bird. A very mean bird.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d the boy says again before pulling a pad and some charcoal pencils from his bag.</p><p>I\u2019m happy for all the information I\u2019m getting. His last name is Henry. He\u2019s new to school. And he\u2019s an artist.</p><p>Before going to work, the boy smiles at me once more. While I\u2019m left gooey from the sentiment, he opens his drawing pad and flips through a few sketches in search of a blank page. I can\u2019t help but notice both that he\u2019s talented and that his subject of choice is... intriguing.</p><p>Ears?</p><p>As if he can hear my thoughts, Mr. Weirdo Henry brushes a stray wave from his eyes and glances at me one final time. He shrugs and smiles slyly, as if to say, \u201cSo what? I like ears.\u201d</p><p>I shrug and smile back. What I\u2019m trying to say without words, and what I hope he understands, is, \u201cHey, we all have our things.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s back to drawing before I can give it another thought, and I\u2019m forced to continue my math homework in silence. But halfway through problem number 3, something dawns on me: the boy\u2019s sweatshirt in my room has to be the one Weirdo Henry is talking about. Apparently it\u2019s not from the reject pile, like my note said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So apparently I lied.</p><p>At midnight, I boot up my laptop. I can type faster than I can scribble. Besides, the note by my bedside is already cluttered with hearts in the margins and flowery words about a boy I just met today.</p><p>10/19 (Tues.)</p><p>Horrible memory popped into my head as I was falling asleep tonight. Worst I can remember, really. Can\u2019t see much... just know I\u2019m in a crowd of people wearing black. Their faces are muddy, and someone is dead. At first, I thought it might be Mom\u2019s funeral, but then I remembered hearing her sobs. She\u2019s there, too. Alive.</p> <p>Can hear the occasional bird, and weeping. The weeping is terrible so I focus on the birds. I think it\u2019s morning, but it\u2019s gray so I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>Terrifying statue of a saintly woman (maybe an angel?) one plot over to the left... carved of green stone and looking like she\u2019s watching us.</p><p>I finish typing and save the file on my computer desktop, naming it, appropriately, Dark Memory.</p><p>I print the page and then place the typed note under the handwritten one; hearts and flowers over the black-and-white account of dark days ahead.</p><p>I climb back into bed and turn off the lights for the second time tonight, thinking of the boy whose first name I don\u2019t know, feeling guilty for thinking of him when there are bigger things ahead.</p> <p>Somehow, amid all the conflicting emotions, sleep grabs my hand and pulls me under.</p><p>And then everything unwritten is gone.</p><p>7</p><p>On the way to school, I consider telling my mom about the funeral memory, until I realize that it might scare her. Not everyone needs to know what\u2019s coming.</p><p>After she drops me off, I head straight for the library. It\u2019s an even-block day, so I have periods 2, 4, 6, and 8: I\u2019ll never be so happy to miss first-period PE. The warning bell hasn\u2019t sounded yet, but I want to arrive early and compose myself for the guy from my notes.</p><p>Mr. Henry.</p> <p>I make my way toward the tables at the back of the library and retrieve a compact mirror from my bag. I use my sleeve to fix my eye makeup and then exchange the compact for my Spanish book.</p><p>I don\u2019t hear him approach. Then, without warning, he\u2019s across from me, leaning on the table, eyes fixed on my face.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I lower the book and my jaw drops. I thought I was prepared, but no. Not for this.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I manage.</p><p>\u201cGood day so far?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I answer truthfully.</p><p>Concern crosses his face, and it warms me. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>\u201cOh, nothing,\u201d I answer. \u201cJust overslept and my mom was annoying and... nothing. Not worth talking about.\u201d</p><p>The bell rings, and he and I are eye-locked. When the shrill tone stops, he whispers, \u201cOkay, but if you decide you do want to talk, you can tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, meaning it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he says back in an intimate whisper, before he\u2019s hushed by Ms. Mason.</p><p>\u201cLuke Henry and London Lane, this is your final warning. No talking!\u201d</p><p>Warmth washes over me at the sound of his name next to mine, and as he searches through his crowded bag for schoolwork, I breathe his name so softly that I can barely hear it myself.</p><p>\u201cLuke.\u201d</p><p>We can\u2019t speak the rest of the ninety-minute period, but his presence makes me feel better. It allows me to forget the frenzied morning and, more important, this morning\u2019s note.</p><p>Halfway through the period, my fingers accidentally brush Luke\u2019s across the table. It feels like someone shot adrenaline directly into my heart; I inhale sharply and quickly move my hand to my lap. Luke glances up at me and smiles, which makes me blush and look away. I hear him chuckle a little under his breath and then turn a page.</p><p>Aware that I can\u2019t seem to remember Luke from tomorrow or the future, all I want to do right now is ditch class and spend the rest of the day getting to know him before he disappears again. Instead, I sit, grabbing glimpses of him every so often, and try my best to act normal.</p><p>I answer the phone before my mom hears the ringtone and scolds me for being up so late.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cWere you asleep?\u201d Jamie asks, more surprised than concerned that she might have woken me.</p><p>\u201cNo, but my mom thinks I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you know I was going to call?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t remember today, only tomorrow on,\u201d I say, rolling my eyes at her, even though she can\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m just kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, tired. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to borrow that supercute green shirt you bought that time your mom took us to the city for your birthday.\u201d</p><p>I am silent. Of course I have no idea what trip she\u2019s talking about from the past, but I think forward to what she\u2019ll wear tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Jamie asks.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m here; sure, it\u2019s fine,\u201d I say in a low tone. \u201cYou\u2019re coming over before school to get it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but remember I have detention, so it\u2019s going to be...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh!\u201d I interrupt. The floorboards are creaking outside my room. \u201cMy mom\u2019s coming. Gotta go!\u201d</p><p>I hang up and toss the phone on the nightstand just as my mom peeks into the room.</p><p>\u201cHoney, it\u2019s late,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI know, I was just going to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Mom gives me a look.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you weren\u2019t talking on the phone?\u201d She smiles in that way that tells me I\u2019ve been caught. And yet, for no particular reason, I deny it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I say, inching under the covers. \u201cWill you turn off the light?\u201d I ask. She does.</p><p>\u201cNight, Mom,\u201d I say, yawning for effect but meaning it, too.</p><p>\u201cGood night, London,\u201d she says, and before I hear her own bedroom door click shut, I\u2019m asleep.</p><p>8</p><p>I\u2019m shivering in my closet, wearing only a bra, tank top, and underwear, wet hair dripping down my back, when Jamie scares the crap out of me by appearing in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she says, with no warning whatsoever.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d I shout, jumping farther into the closet.</p><p>\u201cUptight much?\u201d Jamie teases, taking in the clothes hanging neatly on the racks. \u201cWear this one,\u201d she says, pointing to a plaid miniskirt.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s way too short,\u201d I protest. \u201cI have no idea why I own that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made you buy it,\u201d she says proudly. \u201cI love that skirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have it,\u201d I say, turning away from her and continuing my clothes fit. \u201cWhat are you doing here so early?\u201d I ask casually.</p><p>\u201cYou are so mental,\u201d Jamie says. \u201cWe talked last night. I\u2019m borrowing...\u201d She moves to a row of shirts and quickly looks through them. She locates the sleeve she seeks and yanks the item off the hanger. \u201c... this green shirt today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jamie agrees. She drops her bag and coat to the floor, swaps her own shirt for the green one, then puts herself back together, leaving her shirt in a heap on my closet floor.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want this?\u201d I ask, picking it up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ll get it later. See you in Spanish.\u201d</p><p>And with that, she is gone.</p><p>\u201cLeaving already?\u201d Page Thomas asks anxiously as I slam my PE locker shut. \u201cMan, you\u2019re fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I need to get going,\u201d I say over my shoulder to her. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMonday,\u201d Page corrects me, her voice raining disappointment.</p><p>\u201cOh, right, Monday,\u201d I reply loudly, now all the way to the heavy locker room doors. Page is following me.</p><p>\u201cWait, London?\u201d she asks. \u201cCan I talk to you for a minute?\u201d I sigh, knowing what\u2019s coming.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, with as much enthusiasm as I can muster through my utter disappointment. I want to leave and go meet him.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Page says, beaming. I notice that her icy blue eyes are so light they nearly match the whites. With those and her almost silvery blonde hair, she looks like an ice princess.</p> <p>An ice princess who wears outdated glasses and baggy, mismatched clothes that could one day land her on a makeover show.</p><p>I stare at Page until she speaks.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I feel a little silly asking you this,\u201d she begins, \u201cbut that day when I was on office duty and delivered that note from your mom to your math class, I noticed that Brad Thomas sits next to you and I was wondering if you know if he has a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Brad Thomas. I\u2019ll sit next to him in math for the rest of the year. His handwriting looks like a third grader\u2019s; I know from sneaking a peek at his test to see his score in a couple weeks. Beyond that, he\u2019s definitely not a math genius, either.</p><p>Stalling, I look around to see if anyone\u2019s watching us. My eyes land on Page\u2019s backpack: her name is embroidered there. Page Thomas.</p><p>\u201cYou like a guy with the same last name as you?\u201d I ask randomly.</p> <p>\u201cYep,\u201d Page admits freely, like she planned it that way. \u201cConvenient.\u201d</p><p>More like gross.</p><p>Now Page is the one staring. Expectantly. I know I need to say something, but I\u2019m not sure what. I can\u2019t tell her that I remember what happens to her\u2014that Brad will break her heart\u2014but I need to go. The clock is ticking, and, beyond the fact that I desperately want to meet Luke Henry, I also can\u2019t be late to class. Detention with Jamie and her train wreck is not something I want to witness firsthand.</p><p>\u201cPage, I have to go. I\u2019m going to be late,\u201d I say. Her smile slides off her face, but she doesn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cListen, I don\u2019t really know Brad,\u201d I continue. \u201cWe\u2019re not friends or anything, so I don\u2019t have a clue if he\u2019s dating anyone. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her face is so low it might actually touch the ground. Apparently I\u2019m her only hope, which is ironic, if you think about it. The person who can see the end is the one she\u2019s counting on at the beginning.</p><p>All I want to do is leave, but I feel trapped by Page\u2019s pleading eyes. With no apparent way out, I consider what she\u2019s asking. Would she get over Brad if I told her he was going to humiliate her and break her heart? Probably not. She\u2019d call me crazy and find another way to date him.</p><p>That thought in mind, I surrender.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll try to strike up a conversation with him and get some information. Soon, okay?\u201d</p><p>Page beams and hugs me with a squeal, then takes off. I follow her into the commons, then turn right when she goes straight. I race up the hallway that leads to the library, making a mental note as I go to include the promise in my end-of-the-day recap. I also make a mental note not to obsess about the wrongness of moving this forward.</p><p>Page may not know for sure what\u2019s coming like I do, but every relationship has the potential to fail. Somewhere deep inside, she has to know that\u2019s a possibility. And yet, she\u2019s okay with it. That\u2019s enough for me.</p><p>I try not to think of my own warning sign with Luke\u2014the big flashing one that says YOU DON\u2019T REMEMBER HIM!\u2014but I ignore it for the possibility of a relationship. I guess that makes me a little like Page.</p><p>A boy I don\u2019t recognize accidentally bumps me as he rushes by. He is decent-looking, and I can\u2019t help but wonder: Was that Luke? I watch some of the other male faces blow past, all at once struck by the realization that I don\u2019t have a clue what Luke looks like. He could be walking next to me right now and I wouldn\u2019t know it. What if he thinks I\u2019m a freak for not talking to him? What if he doesn\u2019t like how I look?</p><p>I take cover in the girls\u2019 bathroom to get my anxiety in check. Then, I scan myself in the mirror for anything that might turn Luke off. Thankfully, I\u2019m completely alone as I fix a weird piece of hair and check my teeth, nose, and butt in the mirror.</p><p>The bell rings as I leave the bathroom; I run the rest of the way to the library.</p><p>\u201cTardiness is unacceptable,\u201d Ms. Mason says to me without looking up from her magazine. I move toward the only open seat: the one across from a boy who looks very happy to see me.</p><p>Somehow I know: this is Luke.</p><p>As I sit down, he casually slides a piece of notebook paper across the table, then returns to whatever he was working on. I unpack my schoolwork before reading the page; the wait is excruciating, but I don\u2019t want to seem too eager. When I do read what he\u2019s written, I fight hard to keep my expression in check.</p><p>London,</p><p>It seems we have a problem chatting in class. How about you give me your number and we can try it later?</p><p>Luke</p><p>PS\u2014You look nice today.</p><p>I press my cheek to my shoulder to stifle a snort. Luke wrote the note before I got here; he had no idea how I looked before I sat down.</p><p>For the remainder of the period, I daydream about a future with Luke like normal girls who can\u2019t remember the future might do with a crush. At least that\u2019s the bright side of forgetting him each night: I can wonder.</p><p>Two minutes before the bell, I scrawl my number on the bottom of Luke\u2019s note and pass it back. I am surprised when he risks detention by pulling out his cell phone and saving my number right then and there. Thankfully, Ms. Mason doesn\u2019t notice.</p><p>When the bell rings, Luke and I stand at the same time and walk together to the library doors, close but not touching. Hannah Wright leaves before us and holds the door so it doesn\u2019t slam in our faces. She looks from me to Luke to me again, then smiles encouragingly before turning around. In the hallway, Luke and I turn to go in different directions.</p><p>\u201cTalk to you soon,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I reply. I want to say more, but we are bottlenecking the main hallway, and there is only so much time between classes. Instead, I wave and turn away, forcing myself to walk, not skip, to my locker.</p><p>Later, in World History, Mr. Ellis says he\u2019s going to show a film about Nazi Germany.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s disturbing, but I expect you all to act like mature adults. Anyone who cannot do that will be sent to the office.\u201d</p><p>After study hall with Luke, I\u2019m still feeling more like a giddy schoolgirl than a mature adult. I try to muzzle my permagrin, but it can\u2019t be contained. I turn my head toward the window so Mr. Ellis doesn\u2019t see me smiling and take it the wrong way.</p><p>I\u2019m surprised to discover huge white flakes of snow drifting lazily from the sky. The snow blankets the courtyard like froth on the top of a perfect latte. It\u2019s beautiful and untouched, and it calms me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Giddiness now in check, I look back at Mr. Ellis, who is consulting a notebook on top of his desk. With his pointer finger as a guide, he scans a list. Then he looks up at me.</p><p>\u201cLondon Lane, did you bring your permission slip today?\u201d Everyone in the class turns to look at me. I can\u2019t help but flush because of the attention. For the moment, my grin is gone.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d I say, leaning over to snatch my bag from under my seat. Unless I put it there yesterday and forgot to remind myself, I know the permission slip isn\u2019t inside. Yet I make a show of looking for it.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say after a few seconds. \u201cI guess I forgot it again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to go to the library,\u201d says Mr. Ellis.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, standing up, bag in hand. My face burns as I walk to the front to take the hall pass from Mr. Ellis\u2019s outstretched hand. I leave the classroom, and in the hallway my embarrassment quickly subsides. For forever, this is the type of slipup that I will loathe: the little mistakes that make me seem spastic.</p><p>But not today.</p><p>Today there is snow on the courtyard.</p><p>Today there is Luke.</p> <p>9</p><p>Despite falling flakes obstructing my vision, I see Jamie\u2019s silhouette in the front window as I trudge around the corner to her street.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing that cute coat you bought when we went thrifting?\u201d she asks, even before the front door to her 1970s house is all the way open. \u201cAnd why are you dressed like you\u2019re exploring the Arctic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you watching for me?\u201d I answer her questions with a question as I kick snow off my boots and push past her into the entryway. I start to unravel.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dark,\u201d she shrugs. Jamie will never admit it, but toward me, at least, she\u2019s very protective.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you walk here, anyway?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, tossing wet hair out of my face. \u201cSeemed like a good idea.\u201d</p><p>I finish unwrapping and then neatly stack my winter wear on the entryway bench. But not without grabbing my cell phone in case Luke calls tonight.</p><p>Just as we\u2019re ready to head to Jamie\u2019s room, her mother pops her head around the corner and beams at me. She\u2019s wearing a retro print apron over her power suit.</p><p>\u201cHi, London!\u201d she calls.</p><p>\u201cHi, Susan,\u201d I say with a friendly wave. Jamie rolls her eyes, grabs my hand, and pulls me in the direction of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, sweetheart?\u201d Susan asks as we pass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks for asking,\u201d I call as I\u2019m dragged down to Jamie\u2019s lair in the finished basement.</p><p>Halfway down the stairs, my mom calls to make sure I made it safely. I quickly tell her I\u2019m fine and hang up.</p> <p>Thirty minutes later, I\u2019m on Jamie\u2019s bed, trying not to get bloodred nail polish on her comforter.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have that weird look on your face?\u201d Jamie asks. \u201cYou\u2019re making me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m just happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the weirdo?\u201d Jamie teases.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not weird; he\u2019s hot,\u201d I say back.</p><p>Jamie shrugs.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the deal? Do you remember having babies with him or something?\u201d</p><p>I set down my polish and look at my best friend intently.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say in a whisper. Jamie scoots closer to me. \u201cI can\u2019t remember him at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the point?\u201d she asks, rolling her eyes and looking disappointed. She refocuses on her nails. \u201cWhy bother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the thing,\u201d I say. \u201cIf you think about it, it\u2019s not that he isn\u2019t in my future.\u201d</p><p>That gets her attention. She looks up. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I reread my notes from this week. Monday, I didn\u2019t remember Luke from Tuesday. But then on Tuesday, I talked to him and stuff. See?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh... no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was in my future on Monday, I just didn\u2019t remember it. It\u2019s not that he isn\u2019t in my future....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s probably because he\u2019ll do something bad to you. You\u2019re blocking him.\u201d Jamie sets down her nail polish and looks at me seriously. \u201cLondon, you should stay away from that guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily mean something that bad,\u201d I say, wanting to defend Luke. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s not going to kill me or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Jamie asks.</p><p>\u201cI just know!\u201d I say, not really just knowing. But logically, I remember way into the future, so I assume that I won\u2019t be murdered anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d Jamie playfully shouts, holding up her palms in surrender. \u201cI just think maybe you should aim a little higher.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer, for fear of what\u2019s coming next. I brace myself for the conversation that my note this morning told me we\u2019d have here tonight.</p><p>\u201cTake Ted, for example,\u201d Jamie begins. She means her detention monitor, who also happens to be the Driver\u2019s Education teacher. Who also happens to be married.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d I groan.</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s not nice,\u201d Jamie says with a babyish frown.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s married, Jamie,\u201d I say without looking at her.</p><p>I try to avoid remembering holding Jamie\u2019s hand at the side of her hospital bed after a bottle of pills doesn\u2019t work, but trying not to think of the memory only makes it burrow itself into my brain.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s unhappily married, and he\u2019s a really great guy.\u201d Jamie defends Mr. Rice as I defended Luke. I can\u2019t help but think of her own unhappy marriage to come, of stories of her parents\u2019 unhappy marriage that may have influenced her in some way.</p><p>It reminds me of a note I read this morning from last week.</p><p>\u201cHey, how\u2019s your dad?\u201d I ask casually. Jamie and I will spend a college spring break at his house in L.A. \u201cDidn\u2019t you visit him recently?\u201d</p><p>She gives me a funny look. \u201cWhy are you acting like you know him? You\u2019ve never even met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cAnyway, how was the trip?\u201d</p><p>Jamie eyes me skeptically and applies some polish. \u201cWe already talked about this. The trip was fine. He\u2019s fine. His lame new wife is still lame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if my dad has a lame new wife,\u201d I say under my breath.</p><p>I tighten the cap on the potent red polish. \u201cDo you have any black? My nails are chipped,\u201d I say, surveying the damage.</p><p>\u201cRed on the bottom and black on the top, huh? Very school-spirited of you,\u201d Jamie comments as she digs through a basket of tiny glass bottles in every color. She finds black and tosses it my way. Still, she\u2019s focused.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the dad talk all of a sudden?\u201d Jamie asks, but doesn\u2019t let me answer. \u201cThey\u2019re gone. End of story. Anyway, stop trying to change the subject. I\u2019m serious about Ted. He\u2019s really great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I murmur as I paint.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to meet him after school on Monday,\u201d she says, as if it\u2019s the most natural thing on earth. I stop painting midnail.</p><p>\u201cJamie, seriously, you can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughs like it\u2019s a game.

He\u2019s an adult; you\u2019re a minor. It\u2019s illegal, Jamie. He could get fired and sent to jail.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t. That never happens.\u201d</p><p>That never happens? Do we live in a world where this is so common that Jamie has grounds to say \u201cthat never happens\u201d?</p><p>I ignore her and go on.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only twenty-four,\u201d Jamie answers. \u201cAnd have you not seen him? He\u2019s totally hot.\u201d</p> <p>I think of passing Mr. Rice in the hallway next week: she\u2019s right, he is hot. But that doesn\u2019t make this okay.</p><p>I mentally consult my notes and recall the couple of mentions of guys Jamie has associated with recently. \u201cDon\u2019t you like Jason? Or Anthony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re boys. They\u2019re fine distractions, but Ted is a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe clearly has issues if he\u2019s pursuing a high school girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just any high school girl. And really, London, you can\u2019t change my mind. I like him! Why can\u2019t you just be happy for me?\u201d</p><p>My argument is going nowhere, so I bring out the big guns.</p> <p>\u201cDo I have to tell you how this will end?\u201d I ask softly.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s head whips in my direction. She meets my eyes. In hers, I see a fire blazing.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t tell me that I\u2019m going to get caught cheating, but you\u2019ll happily wreck things with Ted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happily, it\u2019s just that I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she says, holding up a palm. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it. We\u2019ll just see. Okay? We\u2019ll see how things turn out. You could be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I say confidently.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Jamie snaps.</p><p>We are silent for a few moments. I consider the long walk home in the snow, and eventually I take one for the team.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, J, I just worry about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d she says. \u201cBut stop. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, London, listen to me,\u201d Jamie begins, sitting up taller on the bed. \u201cYou can mess with your own business however you want, but keep those memories about me to yourself. It\u2019s weird enough knowing that you know how things will go for me. I\u2019m not one of those people who go to palm readers. I like surprises. Just let me live my life.\u201d Before I can open my mouth, she adds, \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promise sadly.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jamie says with a weak smile.</p><p>I think we\u2019re okay now, but as we walk out of her bedroom to head upstairs for a spaghetti dinner, Jamie mutters, \u201cYou better write that down in your little notebook so you don\u2019t forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I say softly. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>10</p><p>I\u2019m in the cemetery.</p><p>My mother is sobbing to my right. There is a menacing stone angel to my left. Across a semicircle of black-clad mourners, a few faces stand out: an older woman with a white lace handkerchief, a younger woman in a low-cut dress, an imposing bald man who looks like a brick wall.</p><p>My eyes are stuck for a moment on a small black brooch attached to the older woman\u2019s sweater. From where I stand, it looks like a jeweled beetle, and it seems oddly fancy for a funeral. Then again, I vaguely remember reading an article later in life about Egyptians being buried with beetles. Maybe it\u2019s significant to her. Maybe she just likes bugs.</p><p>Tentatively, I inhale, fearing the stench of rotting corpses, but instead I smell two of my favorite scents: grass and rain. Some of the mourners have umbrellas. Some are getting wet.</p><p>I look at the path leading to our gathering: it is dirt and rock, mostly dirt in some places. Because of the rain, there are footprints there. Some small; some large. Lots of footprints.</p><p>I want to walk through the footprints and mess them up, but I don\u2019t. Instead, I stand still in the rain, wondering what\u2019s going on.</p><p>11</p><p>Eyes adjusted to the October morning, I try to read the note in the dark. No go.</p><p>I roll to my side and edge out from under the cozy comforter. Reaching to turn on the bedside lamp that I\u2019ll have for years to come, I knock over a cup of water that I don\u2019t remember leaving on the nightstand.</p><p>Rookie mistake.</p><p>Quickly, I snap on the lamp and mop up the small puddle with my pajama sleeve. The PJs are red thermal; I don\u2019t remember putting them on.</p><p>Situation under control, I sink back against the pillows. Squinting from the light, holding the note inches from my nose, I read.</p><p>10/24 (Sun.)</p><p>Clothes:</p><p>\u2014Red thermal pajamas most of the day</p><p>\u2014Long-sleeved teal sweater and skinny jeans (Mom and I had dinner at Casa de Amigos... spilled hot sauce on upper thigh of jeans... check to see if stain\u2019s out)</p><p>School:</p><p>\u2014Take Span.-Eng. dictionary to Spanish for translation exercise</p><p>\u2014Anatomy quiz (check out study guide by the computer before school)</p><p>\u2014Start on graphic design project</p><p>Other:</p><p>\u2014J was still weird today about Friday\u2019s conversation (told me again NOT to tell her anything about her future)</p><p>\u2014Notes about J &amp; me talking about dads made me curious... snooped in Mom\u2019s room today while she was out. Insane what I found. Envelope in my right desk drawer. Not sure what to do except keep it hidden from Mom for now.</p><p>\u2014Luke didn\u2019t call again today (read back; he sounds awesome minus the no-calling thing)</p><p>I fling off the heavy quilt and plod over to the desk. I grab the study guide from the top and the overstuffed envelope from the drawer. On my way back to bed, my eyes wander to the framed photos of me and Jamie dating back to what looks like junior high. There is a silly collage with photos and magazine cutouts that I can only guess Jamie and I made together. It\u2019s juvenile, but I like it. Without being able to remember for sure, I assume that things were a whole lot simpler then.</p><p>Half an hour later, my mom knocks and I rush to cover up the pile of contraband. When I don\u2019t answer, she opens the door anyway.</p><p>\u201cI knocked,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me quizzically in response to what I can only assume is an expression that is equal parts anger and guilt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be late for school,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll hurry,\u201d I say back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d she asks, a funny expression still plastered on her face.</p><p>You tell me, I think to myself.</p><p>\u201cNothing, why?\u201d I say instead.</p><p>\u201cYou seem... off. You seemed off last night, too,\u201d she says, one hand on the open door and the other on the frame.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not,\u201d I retort. She holds up her hands in surrender.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, London. Just get moving. You\u2019re going to be late.\u201d She turns and closes the door behind her.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, during the ride to school, she interrupts my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cIs this because of that boy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I whip my head in her direction. \u201cDid you read my notes? That\u2019s a total invasion of privacy,\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Mom says calmly. \u201cI most certainly did not read your notes, London Lane. I would never do that. Why would you suggest such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you know about the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon, you told me about him,\u201d Mom says, with an annoying smile.</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, embarrassed. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to talk about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d my mom says, with a little laugh that makes me want to scream. Thankfully, we\u2019ve arrived at the school.</p><p>The moment the car stops in the drop-off zone, I jump out, slam the door, and walk purposefully inside Meridan High.</p><p>As the morning progresses, my hostility toward my mother morphs into anger toward the world. When Jason Samuels accidentally hits me in the shoulder with the basketball during PE, I chuck it right back at him.</p><p>Hard.</p> <p>When Page Thomas dares approach me about her stupid crush, I silence her with one knifelike look.</p><p>When the gorgeous Goth girl who will spend most days in the parking lot for the rest of the year runs into me in the hallway, I don\u2019t apologize.</p><p>And when I throw open the library doors, storm through the metal detectors, and march to my seat for study hall, I\u2019m ready to confront Luke about not calling or just ignore him completely.</p><p>But then he arrives. And speaks.</p><p>\u201cWant to come to my house for lunch today?\u201d he asks, all dimple and blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Jamie is way too nosy. I\u2019ve only opened my bag to put my Spanish textbook in it before class, and she\u2019s managed to log its contents in under two seconds.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say, glancing at the manila envelope before zipping the bag and easing it onto my shoulder.</p><p>Jamie is staring at me. She\u2019s not buying \u201cnothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say, pulling her away from my locker and in the direction of Spanish. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, but it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds interesting,\u201d she says, looping her arm through mine. Jamie and I will always walk like this: arm in arm. It\u2019s our thing and I like it, particularly this morning, when I\u2019m feeling like I need her strength to get through what\u2019s ahead.</p><p>Then again, remembering this morning\u2019s note, I know that she needs my strength today, too.</p><p>Jamie is looking at me expectantly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s some old photos and stuff,\u201d I say quietly, as if it\u2019s a secret.</p><p>\u201cOf who?\u201d Jamie asks.</p><p>\u201cOf my dad,\u201d I say, wincing.</p><p>\u201cYou and the dad thing lately...\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice trails off and she looks ahead to navigate us through the bustling hallway.</p><p>\u201cI found them hidden in a box in my mom\u2019s closet with some of my dad\u2019s old ties and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were snooping around in your mom\u2019s closet?\u201d Jamie asks, totally missing the point.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say without explaining. \u201cAnyway, that\u2019s not the worst part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst part?\u201d Jamie\u2019s pretty eyes are back on me now.</p><p>\u201cHe sent me some birthday cards when I was little,\u201d I say, feeling sick. Exactly three. Exactly three birthday cards that, apparently, my mother hid from me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d Jamie asks, intrigued.</p><p>\u201cJust normal stuff,\u201d I lie. In truth, the cards are depressing. They\u2019re sparse and apologetic.</p><p>But they\u2019re there.</p><p>Jamie and I walk in silence the rest of the way to Spanish, me thinking about my dad, Jamie gripping my arm tightly because I think she knows she needs to right now.</p><p>12</p><p>\u201cIs that him?\u201d Jamie whispers as she leans forward toward me. Our desks are pushed together, head to head. We\u2019re supposed to be translating a Spanish newspaper article into English.</p><p>Instead, Jamie is flirting with Anthony and I am looking at faded photographs that I\u2019ve expertly hidden within the pages of my Spanish dictionary.</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d I whisper back.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure why we\u2019re whispering: we\u2019re supposed to talk during language lab. Ms. Garcia looks at us funny, so Jamie translates the headline of the story.</p><p>EARTHQUAKE SHAKES MEXICO CITY</p><p>\u201cEl terremoto...\u201d She reads aloud in Spanish as she writes the phrase, accentuating the tongue roll to make me giggle. I know she\u2019s trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>I hear Amber Valentine behind me, struggling to pronounce \u201chambre,\u201d or hungry. Giving up, she decides to amuse her partner by saying \u201ctengo hamburger,\u201d and I suspect the reason he laughs so hard at her stupid joke is that Amber Valentine looks like someone named Amber Valentine.</p><p>\u201cLet me see another one,\u201d Jamie commands when she\u2019s finished writing. I offer her the dictionary with the photos inside.</p><p>As she checks them out, I look at the pictures upside down and backward, thinking to myself that my dad looks exactly as I\u2019d imagine him to look.</p><p>He has kind eyes and a huge, openmouthed grin. Clearly, I got my hair color from him, but his skin is ghostlike and freckled, whereas mine is more creamy porcelain, like Mom\u2019s. Wearing 90 SPF sunblock, I am capable of getting a tiny tint of tan; I see from photos that Dad is either white or burned.</p><p>I can almost hear an easy, booming laugh erupting from the worn images. His uniform of choice seems to be faded jeans and untucked shirts, and in it, he\u2019s big and strong, ready to fight off monsters real or imagined.</p><p>Jamie pauses at a photo of my father teaching a preschool-aged me to swim. In the picture, he\u2019s looking at my younger, more scraggly self with a mixture of admiration, curiosity, and blatant love. I feel like I\u2019m going to cry.</p><p>Jamie glances my way and then turns the page.</p><p>\u201cIs this your grandmother?\u201d she asks quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I say, leaning toward her now. She turns the book in my direction and points to the background of a photo of my dad holding baby me.</p><p>There, standing behind us, is someone I hadn\u2019t even noticed.</p><p>Someone I don\u2019t know, but recognize.</p><p>Someone I haven\u2019t met yet, but will.</p><p>My heartbeat quickens as I grab the dictionary and yank it back to my side of the desk island. I lean in closer and closer still, wishing that I had one of those tiny magnifying glass things that diamond dealers use.</p><p>There, in the middle of Spanish, with Jamie staring at me like she\u2019s embarrassed to know me, something clicks.</p><p>The woman in the background of the photo is very clearly my grandmother. She is looking at baby me with such love and devotion that it almost hurts.</p><p>More than her expression, her appearance is the dead giveaway. Her hair matches mine and my father\u2019s, and much of the rest of her is carbon copied in him and sprinkled in me.</p><p>\u201cTwenty minutes,\u201d Ms. Garcia calls to the class, interrupting my analysis.</p><p>Jamie mutters something profane under her breath and grabs our paper. She begins furiously translating.</p><p>\u201cWant help?\u201d I offer.</p><p>\u201cNo, keep obsessing,\u201d she says without looking up.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Jamie has turned in the lab paper we\u2019ll get back next week with a bright red B+ on top, and we\u2019re gathering our things. I\u2019m carefully sliding the dictionary back into my bag, trying not to let any photos loose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are we doing for lunch?\u201d Jamie asks, slinging her bag over her shoulder. Just then, I remember what I\u2019m doing. I straighten up and look at my friend.</p><p>\u201cLuke asked me to lunch today,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, sounding disappointed. I think I see a flash of something in her eyes. Annoyance? Jealousy? \u201cThat\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll go with Anthony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, J.\u201d</p> <p>I notice then that Anthony is leaving in a hurry, and I wonder how she\u2019ll really spend her lunch hour.</p><p>As I walk to meet Luke, my mind is on the photos. One photo, really. One person, specifically: my grandmother.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe that I didn\u2019t recognize her this morning. Now, I consider what that recognition means.</p><p>On one hand, I have an older, wiser role model who (presumably) loves me and might want to bake me cookies and braid my hair. Well, okay, just the cookies.</p><p>But on the other hand, my single future memory of her is the darkest one I\u2019ve got: my grandmother is the older woman wearing the pretty beetle brooch at the funeral.</p> <p>My brain twists and turns as I round the corner to the commons. I see Luke leaning against the far wall, bag dropped to the floor next to him. His eyes are cast down; he appears to be deep in thought. As soon as I wonder what he\u2019s thinking about, his eyes are on mine. He smiles, pushes off the brick wall, and picks up his bag.</p><p>For some reason, my brain chooses that exact moment to figure it out. I stop halfway across the commons. A boy nearly collides with me. Luke looks confused.</p><p>The funeral.</p><p>Grandma.</p><p>Mom.</p><p>There is only one logical explanation. I don\u2019t want to think it but the thought shoves its way to the front of the line anyway.</p> <p>It\u2019s Dad\u2019s funeral.</p><p>My dad is going to die.</p><p>There.</p><p>Thought.</p><p>13</p><p>I am almost completely distracted by Luke by the time we make it through rows of student cars and reach his...</p><p>Minivan?</p><p>He laughs at my baffled expression at the sight of a car usually reserved for soccer moms. Apparently it was his soccer mom\u2019s car before she replaced it with an oh-so-economical SUV.</p> <p>As he starts the engine, Luke confirms that, yes, I\u2019m still fine with going to his house for lunch instead of going out for pizza or something. Apparently his mother has taken his baby sisters shopping for new clothes in the city today.</p><p>Apparently Luke has baby sisters.</p><p>\u201cHow old are they?\u201d I ask, looking around the van.</p><p>\u201cAlmost three,\u201d Luke says. I screw up my face in concentration as I try to figure out the math.</p><p>\u201cAre you wondering whether one of my parents is remarried?\u201d Luke asks with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d I confess. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty huge age difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is,\u201d Luke says. \u201cMy parents had me young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they decided to have more kids later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Luke says. \u201cThey divorced and remarried each other. Then had the twins.\u201d</p><p>I must still have a funny look on my face, because Luke keeps talking.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s weird. Want to hear the saga?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Luke says, smiling. \u201cSo, we lived in Chicago when I was born. My parents were high school sweethearts. They got married young, right after graduation. Can you imagine?\u201d he asks, but doesn\u2019t let me answer.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, they had me when they were twenty-five or something. They were superpoor, so we lived in my grandparents\u2019 basement. My dad was in law school and my mom took care of me and worked nights to help pay for it. I guess they were pretty happy despite the no-money thing.</p><p>\u201cAfter school my dad got recruited by a big law firm in New York. We moved there when I was around five or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lived in New York? That\u2019s so cool,\u201d I say, remembering the city from visits I\u2019ll have as an adult. I can\u2019t wait to go.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was. I mean, I was young, but I remember a lot of it. My mom used to take me around the city. It was really fun. You know how some childhood memories just stick with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I lie, trying to plaster a nostalgic look on my face. Luke pauses and smiles at me. He looks like he wants to ask something, but he doesn\u2019t. Instead, he continues his story.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, the fun didn\u2019t last long. Dad made partner and my parents started fighting because he spent a lot of time at work. Like, a lot. I don\u2019t remember him being home much for a few years.\u201d</p><p>At least you remember him at all, I think.</p><p>Luke exits the freeway and turns right, toward the newer housing development across the highway from mine. I am happy to discover how close we live to each other.</p><p>Luke goes on. \u201cSo when I was about ten, they got a divorce. For two years, I didn\u2019t see my dad at all. He sent cards on my birthday and stuff...\u201d</p><p>Cringe.</p><p>\u201c... and I know he paid child support. We moved to Boston. My mom took a job at a furniture store. She worked a ton and so I spent the summers with my aunt and uncle.\u201d</p><p>Luke pauses again, as if he\u2019s waiting for me to say something. Unsure how to respond, I look back until he is forced to return his eyes to the road. He continues.</p><p>\u201cThen one day Dad showed up with flowers and begged Mom to take him back. Eventually, she did, and he took a job in Boston at a smaller firm and came home at five thirty every night. It was like New York had never happened.</p><p>\u201cIt was all pretty weird, but that\u2019s my parents. Then one day they shock me with news that they\u2019re having twins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say when he\u2019s finished.</p><p>\u201cI know, sorry. That was really long and boring,\u201d Luke says.</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. It sounds like a movie.\u201d</p><p>Luke laughs and says, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure we all have our movie dramas,\u201d in a way that makes me think he can see into my soul.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your parents?\u201d he asks casually.</p><p>\u201cMy mom sells real estate,\u201d I say, eyes on the houses we\u2019re passing.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your dad? What does he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say quietly. Luke glances at me.</p><p>\u201cSorry for bringing it up,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal,\u201d I lie. In truth, it\u2019s a very big deal, particularly today, but it\u2019s nothing I need to share with a potential boyfriend who seems to play no part in my future. I\u2019m relieved when we reach Luke\u2019s house. Luke\u2019s very new, very large house.</p><p>We go in, and after a quick tour of the main level, Luke fixes turkey sandwiches in the kitchen while I scan a mantel in the library bursting with framed photos of him and his little sisters. I feel a little twinge of jealousy at the sight of the happy siblings.</p><p>A particular photo of Luke when he looks to be eleven or twelve catches my attention, then magnetically draws it back the first few times I look away. In it, he\u2019s clearly going through a tough-guy fashion phase. I can\u2019t stop looking at it.</p><p>Finally, I focus on shots of his baby sisters.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re adorable,\u201d I say about the little girls when Luke brings in lunch.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they really are. You should see them in real life. They say the most hilarious stuff.\u201d Luke is beaming, and the thought of him serving as older brother to these two precious ladies feels right. \u201cAnyway, you\u2019ll meet them sometime,\u201d he adds. \u201cHere you go,\u201d he says, offering me a plate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were on a crew team,\u201d I say before taking a bite of the best turkey sandwich on earth.</p><p>He frowns, and I consider that he might have shared that with me already. Instead, he replies, \u201cI need to keep you away from the photos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cute,\u201d I mumble through bread and turkey, admiring a photo of Luke and his teammates. He looks oddly out of place among the Ivy-bound prepsters, but strangely at ease just the same.</p><p>\u201cHa-ha,\u201d he replies sarcastically, and then smiles. \u201cI\u2019m not really into team sports, but crew was pretty fun. You have no idea what cold is until you\u2019ve been dunked in the Charles River at six in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>We share a laugh and then finish our lunches before Luke gives me a guided tour of the rest of the house. It\u2019s gorgeous, and with every new room, I search for traces of him.</p><p>Luke does his homework here. Luke watches TV there. Luke plays video games here. Luke eats dinner there.</p><p>Upstairs, there are four bedrooms bordering a U-shaped balcony that overlooks the main entryway. In one corner is the master bedroom; closest to it is the twins\u2019 bedroom. Next is the guest bedroom.</p><p>And then, we approach Luke\u2019s room.</p><p>My heart races a bit as I take in the dark wood and deep blue walls, which stand in stark contrast to the lightness of the rest of the house. I can see a well-worn guitar leaning against a low chair in the corner. A massive oil painting of a girl\u2019s ear rests against the wall. It\u2019s strange and beautiful at the same time, and I can\u2019t help but wonder who the ear belongs to. Does Luke want to paint my ear?</p> <p>The covers are thrown in a modest attempt at making the bed, and I find myself wanting to run over and smell the pillows.</p><p>Somehow, I manage not to act like a total stalker.</p><p>We\u2019re tight on time, so I don\u2019t get much farther than the doorway, and too soon, Luke is gently guiding me away from the only place I care to be at this second.</p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d he says softly, placing his hand on my back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get you into trouble.\u201d</p><p>I reluctantly agree, but as we make our way back down the grand staircase and out to the minivan, I feel an unmistakable pull from his bedroom.</p><p>There is just so much Luke in that room. I want more of it.</p> <p>We drive back to school in comfortable silence and walk inside hand in hand. Just before parting ways in the middle of the commons, Luke turns to face me.</p><p>\u201cWant to go out on Saturday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, maybe before he\u2019s even finished his question. I grin at him and he laughs at me.</p><p>And then he moves closer.</p><p>I hold my breath, considering that Luke might kiss me right here in the middle of the commons. Just as I\u2019m deciding whether or not I can kiss with an audience, Luke, staring intently into my eyes, raises a hand toward my face. Slowly, softly, he rubs his thumb along my jawbone. I\u2019m hypnotized by the most perfect kind of touch. Oddly, it feels even more intimate than a kiss.</p><p>\u201cTalk to you later,\u201d Luke whispers, before breaking the trance and heading off in the direction of his next class.</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d I breathe after him.</p><p>I stand still, relishing the moment. Then, just before I turn to float to History, a familiar outfit catches my eye. At the other end of the vast common area, Jamie stands in front of the soda machine, staring at me.</p> <p>I wave and she waves back, but there is something missing in her simple gesture. I consider going over and talking to her. But before my feet can move, Jamie turns and leaves.</p><p>14</p><p>\u201cJamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi! Why are you answering like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just surprised that you\u2019re calling, I guess,\u201d I admit.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jamie plays dumb.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed upset today,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d I imagine the guilty look on her face on the other end of the phone. I can hear it in her voice, and that\u2019s enough for me. I\u2019m moving on.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d she says. \u201cHad dinner, watched some TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say anything to your mom about the stuff you found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d I practically shout into the phone. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to her about that,\u201d I add at a lower volume.</p><p>\u201cI hear you,\u201d Jamie says in a way that annoys me. Jamie\u2019s mom will never be sneaky like mine. She\u2019ll support Jamie through everything.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I did it,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cDid what?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cUgh, your messed-up memory is so annoying sometimes,\u201d she says with a heavy sigh. \u201cI met Ted after school.\u201d</p><p>And then, I remember.</p><p>I remember the relationship that will destroy a marriage, ruin a career, and break my best friend\u2019s heart. I recall notes about trying to talk her out of it, and more notes about trying to ignore it.</p><p>I remember the future when it all plays out, and suddenly I feel sick to my stomach. Jamie is stubborn, but I should have tried harder.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jamie. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay? Are you serious? I\u2019m better than okay. He\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but wonder if this is in response to Jamie seeing me with Luke.</p><p>\u201cJamie, I just think you need to really consider what you\u2019re doing. This is a big deal.\u201d I\u2019m trying to sound like a concerned friend and not a parent, but it\u2019s coming out the other way around.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be happy for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ, I want you to be happy. I just don\u2019t think this is right. I\u2019m really worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t be,\u201d Jamie snaps.</p><p>I know she\u2019s pissed, and yet, I have to keep trying. I ignore the notes that told me never to tell Jamie about her future.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to leave his wife, and you\u2019ll just end up hurt. You\u2019ll even try to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSHUT UP, LONDON!\u201d Jamie shouts into the phone. \u201cI told you not to tell me anything, and you wrote it down, so I know you know. Don\u2019t even try to pretend you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say forcefully. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you. But you don\u2019t have to remember the future to know that a grown man only wants one thing from a high school girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a bitch, London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, if you stop acting like a slut.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both silent, and I immediately want to suck the biting words back into my mouth. But it\u2019s too late. My memory is right: Jamie and I won\u2019t talk again for a while after this. Still, I try to fix the situation.</p><p>\u201cJ, I just worry about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to worry anymore.

She ignored me in Spanish (notes say she has all week), then came over after school for a borrowed clothes swap like we were breaking up. Barely spoke to me, then ripped the BFF poster in half!! I feel bad but this is crazy.</p><p>Bright side:</p><p>Luke and I have a date on Sat. night!! Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t talk much in study hall today. He was sketching a giant ear (?) most of the time and then he had to go help his mom at lunch. Think he was about to kiss me before he left! Maybe Sat.</p><p>16</p> <p>\u201cHave I ever changed something that was supposed to happen?\u201d I ask my mom as we pull into the parking lot before school. My head is heavy and it\u2019s only 7:24 in the morning.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe future,\u201d I say, wishing for one second she could read my mind so that I didn\u2019t have to explain it. \u201cMy memories. Have I ever changed a memory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, let me think,\u201d she says, pondering the thought a little too long. Finally, she\u2019s got something. \u201cYou skipped Jamie\u2019s thirteenth birthday party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou remembered that you were going to break your nose,\u201d she says with a chuckle. Not funny, I think, but I stay quiet and listen. \u201cIt was a pool party at the rec center, out on the deck. There were sliding glass doors and you remembered running full force into one of them. So you skipped the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happened?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou missed out on the fun and you broke your nose later that year when you tripped over a stray dog that you brought home.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re idle in the drop-off area, and I need to get out now. She looks over and touches the tip of a nose that looked perfectly fine to me in the mirror this morning.</p><p>\u201cSo, really, I didn\u2019t change anything?\u201d I ask, part dejected and part annoyed. Frankly, I\u2019m having a hard time not asking her why she\u2019s been lying to me all my life, as this morning\u2019s notes reported.</p><p>\u201cI guess not,\u201d my mom says. When I exhale loudly, she adds, \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that you couldn\u2019t, you know. Maybe you just didn\u2019t in that situation. What\u2019s wrong, London?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just feel sick,\u201d I say, because right now, I really do.</p><p>Another parent gives her car horn a gentle tap to politely ask us to move along. My mom glances in the rearview mirror, then looks at me earnestly.</p><p>\u201cYou know, London, the thing is, unless you told me about it or wrote it down, you wouldn\u2019t really know that you were making changes to your future, even if you were. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>I take a moment to consider her statement. Say that right now, I remember that tomorrow I\u2019ll be hit by a bus. I don\u2019t tell my mom about it or write it down tonight, so tomorrow morning that knowledge is lost completely. But tomorrow, I take a different route to school and unknowingly avoid the bus-hitting incident. Then, I\u2019ve changed my future without knowing it.</p><p>I genuinely smile for the first time this morning.</p><p>\u201cIt makes perfect sense,\u201d I say as I release my seat belt and open the door. I wave good-bye, rush inside, and head to my first class.</p><p>Barely inside the locker room, I\u2019m accosted by Page Thomas.</p><p>\u201cHave you asked him yet?\u201d she says, standing awkwardly in her baggy sportswear.</p> <p>I can see a costume in Page\u2019s locker instead of street clothes. I\u2019m dressed in a black crewneck sweater, a black denim skirt, and orange and black striped tights that I found in my dresser. Not a costume, but festive just the same.</p><p>Page stares at me, arms crossed, as if it\u2019s my duty to seal her romantic fate. For a glimmer of a second, I consider telling her the truth. But then, I think of Brad Thomas and what he\u2019ll do to her. I think of her public rejection. I think of the sadness in her when it happens.</p><p>And then I think of myself.</p><p>Underneath it all, I can\u2019t deny that I want to try to change something small to find out whether I might be able to change something big.</p><p>With all this in mind, rather than telling Page Thomas the truth\u2014that I never actually spoke to Brad\u2014I turn to face the girl in the baggy sportswear and spew a lie right to her face.</p><p>\u201cPage,\u201d I say, feigning sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but apparently Brad Thomas is gay.\u201d</p><p>17</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d I call to my mom before closing the front door and joining Luke on the porch.</p><p>This is it: our first date.</p><p>I pored through the notes all day, giggling and gasping right up until the moment I started getting ready. That took an hour, and then I spent the next one toning it down to make it look effortless.</p><p>He\u2019s late, but I don\u2019t mind. He\u2019s here.</p><p>Luke directs me to the maroon minivan in the driveway (which I\u2019m glad my notes warned me about, because otherwise I\u2019d be concerned). He holds the door open for me in a way that\u2019s more natural than forced. He seems to be a gentleman, probably the product of polite parents.</p><p>We settle into our seats and strap seat belts across our bodies. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI got caught up in a painting,\u201d he explains as he turns the ignition and adjusts the heat. \u201cI lost track of time.\u201d</p><p>Annoyance creeps up on me. He was painting? I take a deep breath and shove it away. He\u2019s here now.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he asks, so intimately that I want to grab him. I\u2019m completely over his lateness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, smiling. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter now,\u201d he says, expertly backing out of the driveway onto the quiet street.</p><p>\u201cDo I smell pizza?\u201d I ask, suddenly salivating. Luke glances in my direction and then forward again.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI just picked some up for my family before I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, and shrug to myself as Luke shifts the van into drive and accelerates.</p><p>The radio plays quietly as Luke navigates the streets of my development like he\u2019s lived here for years. Soon enough, we\u2019re barreling north on one of the two highways that run in and out of town.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the movie?\u201d I ask. He had outlined a dinner and movie date for my mom, but I don\u2019t care where we go. I don\u2019t mind if I stare at a blank wall, as long as I do it in Luke\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t lie to your mom,\u201d he says cryptically.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried, and it\u2019s okay if you did,\u201d I say, looking out at the clear, cold night.</p><p>Luke drives and I ride north and north and north of town, and for a fleeting second, I wonder whether I\u2019m that girl in horror movies who walks toward the monster instead of running to safety. I\u2019m breezily allowing this cute guy I don\u2019t remember to take me to the boondocks. Then, as quickly as it arrived, I push the thought away. There is nothing monstrous about Luke Henry. There is nothing frightening about the boy I know from my notes. I feel completely safe in this van that smells like pizza.</p><p>I watch the sky as we drive, and the farther we get from the city, the more stars appear. \u201cDo you even know where you\u2019re going?\u201d I ask, not minding if we get lost. \u201cDidn\u2019t you just move here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI scoped out our destination this afternoon,\u201d he admits.</p><p>\u201cHow very organized of you,\u201d I say, settling back into the seat and feeling totally at ease. I\u2019m completely calm as Luke turns off the highway onto a frontage road, takes a right onto a smaller residential street, and turns right onto a dirt road that winds up a small hill into blackness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel the safest I will feel in years as this stranger eases his mother\u2019s minivan off the gravel and drives slowly across the prairie to the edge of a small hill.</p><p>Luke parks directly in front of a NO TRESPASSING sign on the barbed-wire fence that keeps us from driving off the incline. He kills the engine and the headlights along with it. I take in the twinkling, scattered town below, sprawling across more than twenty miles of land, just because it can.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I thought so,\u201d he says, eyes straight ahead. I like that he likes this town. It\u2019s not for everyone, but it will always be a little part of me.</p> <p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve never been up here before?\u201d</p><p>Good question, I think. \u201cUm, no,\u201d I reply. \u201cIn fact, I have no idea where we are.\u201d</p><p>Luke takes his eyes off the landscape for the first time and settles on me. His hands are still resting lightly on the steering wheel. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty trusting, you know. I could be a murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you could be, but I doubt it.\u201d I say, transfixed by his pale eyes. \u201cI feel too safe with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d he says sweetly. He pauses for a few moments and I think he might lean over and kiss me, but he doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says louder, hitting his hands lightly on the steering wheel. \u201cLet\u2019s get this party started. You hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t think anyone delivers out here,\u201d I say, scanning the barren land around us.</p><p>\u201cNever fear, I\u2019ve got it covered. Just a minute.\u201d Luke pops the back door, gets out, and disappears behind the van. I turn around to see what he\u2019s doing and realize that the middle row of seats is missing. On the third row, there are two throw pillows that look like they were taken from someone\u2019s couch; a soft knitted blanket folded neatly on the seat; and a small cooler on top of the blanket.</p><p>Luke spies me checking out his setup and smiles sheepishly when our eyes meet. My stomach spins at the sight of the dimple on his right cheek.</p><p>He closes the door with a light thud. Instead of getting back in the driver\u2019s seat, Luke opens the automatic sliding door on the far side of the van and climbs in. He\u2019s carrying what looks like a pizza delivery sleeve in his right hand and a plastic bag in his left.</p><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d I say playfully.</p> <p>\u201cCome on back,\u201d he instructs with a laugh.</p><p>Instead of attempting to gracefully climb between our seats, I get out of the van and enter through the sliding door on my side. Crouched down, I walk to the back of the vehicle and sit next to Luke, who has cleared the blanket and the cooler from the third row and propped a pillow on the seatback for me to lean against. From some secret compartment, he retrieves a remote control.</p><p>\u201cWhoops,\u201d he says as he gets up and scoots to the front of the van. He reaches up to the dashboard and turns the ignition, fiddles with the heater and some other controls, then returns to our seat. I hadn\u2019t noticed the drop-down DVD player until now; it illuminates the backseat. A copyright warning is our nightlight as Luke pulls a miraculously warm pizza from the sleeve (apparently he \u201cborrowed\u201d it), retrieves paper plates and napkins from the sack, and grabs sodas from the cooler.</p><p>I recognize the movie from the first five notes of its sound track. As the signature opener of Star Wars scrolls up the tiny screen, I scoot closer to Luke Henry on our makeshift couch in the middle of nowhere. I am the happiest I\u2019ll be in years.</p><p>\u201cI love this movie,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he smiles, still looking at the screen.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might.\u201d Luke looks at me like he can see into my soul, and all of a sudden I feel naked. Breaking the tension, I reach for the pizza at my feet and begin eating. Luke follows suit, and between the two of us, the whole thing is gone quickly.</p> <p>Full and content, we watch the movie in silence. Halfway through, I pull the blanket over my legs. Someone texts Luke but he doesn\u2019t answer; he turns the ringer off and tosses the phone to the front seat. He puts his arm around my shoulders, and we snuggle together like we\u2019ve known each other forever.</p><p>After the movie, Luke makes his way to the front of the van, explaining that he should turn off the car for a little bit to conserve gas.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get us stranded out here,\u201d he explains.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t, either,\u201d he says seriously. \u201cBut I think your mom might.\u201d Instead of rejoining me, Luke pulls open the moonroof and asks me to hand him the pillows. He lines them up against the backs of the driver\u2019s and passenger seats and lies down with his head on one.</p><p>\u201cCome here?\u201d he says, more as a question than a command. The van has grown cold quickly, so I drag the blanket with me as I scoot to the forward section and lie down parallel to Luke. We settle the blanket over both of us, tucking it in around our bodies to trap the heat.</p><p>Luke and I stare straight up through the large window at the winter sky, overcrowded with stars. My teeth begin to chatter and my body starts shaking, but it\u2019s not the cold. Luke moves closer to me and grabs my hand under the covers.</p><p>\u201cThis is nice,\u201d he says softly, after a few moments of silence.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cLike we\u2019ve known each other for a while, right?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I mumble, scooting closer to Luke\u2019s warm shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWant my theory?\u201d Luke asks, carefully rolling onto his side to face me. His eyes look mischievous, like he\u2019s got a great secret to tell.</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d I say, still on my back but facing him instead of the stars now.</p><p>\u201cReincarnation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReincarnation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know what that is, right?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. I\u2019m not dumb. I\u2019m just wondering what that has to do with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my theory is that we were married in some past life. Maybe I was a great king and you were my queen and we were killed by an angry mob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did we do to make the mob so angry that they wanted to kill us?\u201d I tease.</p><p>Luke laughs and continues. \u201cAll right, forget that. Maybe we were just average people living sometime, someplace. Just elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElsetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not even a word,\u201d he says, sidetracked.</p><p>\u201cI know. I just made it up. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, we were married elsetime. Anyway, we died of whatever you die from, let\u2019s say natural causes. But we were in love, so our souls keep finding each other in whatever forms our bodies take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you Hindu or something?\u201d I ask, avoiding the fact that my stomach is in knots from hearing his beautiful theory.</p><p>\u201cNo, we used to be Catholic. But I did have a religion class at my last school that exposed us to different ideas. I think the concept of reincarnation is a good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re Catholic, shouldn\u2019t you believe in heaven and hell and all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I used to be Catholic,\u201d he replies.</p><p>\u201cNo heaven then, huh?\u201d I press on.</p><p>\u201cWho knows until we experience it? I think that heaven and reincarnation are both ways of making us feel better about what happens to people\u2019s souls after death. I hope at least one of them is true. I don\u2019t like to think about being worm food.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t really like to think of death at all,\u201d I reply truthfully.</p><p>We\u2019re both quiet for a few minutes, and then Luke breaks the silence. \u201cI think you\u2019re supposed to save the death discussion until at least the third date.\u201d We chuckle halfheartedly and Luke rolls onto his back again.</p><p>Trying to lighten the mood, I ask, \u201cWhat were our names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur names?\u201d Luke says, sounding confused.</p> <p>\u201cYes, our names. Elsetime. When we were madly in love and married and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds so cheesy when you say it like that.\u201d Luke looks away for a few seconds, and I imagine that he\u2019s blushing, but I can\u2019t be sure.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI like it. Don\u2019t be embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>He looks back into my eyes and we\u2019re locked there for a few moments. And then, before I can worry about what he\u2019s doing, Luke leans over and kisses me. Barely there at first, then more purposeful, the kiss is soft and electric at the same time. It\u2019s so perfect that, before it\u2019s over, I\u2019m heartbroken that I won\u2019t remember it.</p><p>When we part, Luke\u2019s eyes stay on mine. The moment is more intense than even he knows; I look away.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks. \u201cWas that bad?\u201d</p><p>Quickly, I meet his gaze again. \u201cNo!\u201d I say a little too loudly. \u201cNot at all. It was amazing.\u201d I\u2019m glad to be in the dark; I can feel my face flush.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Luke says. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve wanted to do that for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you did,\u201d I reply with a grin. Maybe it\u2019s the acknowledgment of the situation, but at once I feel silly. Luke might, too: he eases onto his back again, careful to leave room for me to cuddle close.</p><p>There\u2019s an awkward silence again.</p><p>Until I throw a rock through it.</p> <p>\u201cSo elsetime... I think my name was Heloise. Or Elizabeth. No, I\u2019ve got it. I was Caroline.\u201d</p><p>Luke waits a beat, and then joins the game. \u201cThat\u2019s a good one,\u201d he responds earnestly. \u201cAnd I was Benjamin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr William,\u201d I interrupt.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s good, too. I was William. I was a stonemason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you were. And I was a housewife raising our three children: Eliza, Mathilda, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRex, after our pet dinosaur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cREX?\u201d I screech. All of the happy nervousness jumps out of me at once; I burst out laughing and can\u2019t stop. I am delirious. Luke laughs with me for a minute and then calms himself and stares in awe as I curl into a ball and nearly hyperventilate. By the time I\u2019ve composed myself, I have tears streaming down my cheeks, and my stomach muscles ache.</p><p>\u201cThat funny, huh?\u201d</p> <p>Residual giggles sneak out of me as I unfold myself and smooth the blanket back across my legs. \u201cPretty funny,\u201d I agree. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019m just easily amused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheap date,\u201d he teases. I lean over and playfully punch him with my left hand, which he grabs and holds for safekeeping.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re surprising,\u201d I say, looking to the sky.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cMost guys don\u2019t make up stories like that,\u201d I say quietly, thinking of the boys and men I will encounter in my lifetime. \u201cEspecially not guys who look like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, most girls who look like you are prom queens,\u201d Luke says, matching my tone. \u201cBut you seem to avoid the spotlight. You have one good friend, and you do your own thing. I like that about you.\u201d He kisses my knuckles and it sends a spark through me.</p><p>\u201cWhere did we live?\u201d I ask softly, gently removing my hand so that I can lie flat and get comfortable. I scoot even closer to his side, if that\u2019s possible. \u201cLet\u2019s see... I believe we lived in... Ireland.\u201d I\u2019ve answered my own question.</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Luke agrees, clearly okay heading back to make-believe. \u201cAnd we farmed potatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were busy,\u201d I murmur, feeling exhausted. The emotions, the laughter, the warmth of Luke\u2019s body, it\u2019s all weighing me down now.</p><p>\u201cYes, we were. Very, very busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had red hair,\u201d I continue, so comfortable I feel like I\u2019m in my own bed. Of course, Luke wouldn\u2019t be there with me, so I\u2019m glad I\u2019m here.</p><p>\u201cYou have red hair now,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll always have red hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. It\u2019s one of the best things about you.\u201d Luke\u2019s words are garbled and I\u2019m spellbound by the even tone of his voice and the vast blackness of the universe above.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I speak in a barely audible tone.</p><p>Luke\u2019s breath is even now, and mine falls into step with his. I am thankful for this day, this boy beside me, and this blanket keeping us warm.</p><p>A distant question forms in the depths of my mind.</p><p>What time is it?</p><p>The question is fleeting, flitting, pushed aside by a more prevalent and wonderful thought: I think I\u2019m falling in love.</p><p>No, I know I am.</p><p>I\u2019m falling in love with Luke.</p><p>I close my eyes from the sheer mass of it all, just for a moment.</p><p>For a few moments.</p><p>For a while.</p><p>And now, I\u2019m in Ireland.</p><p>I\u2019m in the Ireland I\u2019ve seen in movies, at least. Standing in a gargantuan green field with a short stone wall marking perimeters too far off to reach, I know this is our land, Luke\u2019s and mine. The tiny stone cottage behind us with the smoke billowing from the chimney is ours, too. Beside me, Luke wears a thick ivory wool sweater and a plaid scarf, and he smokes a pipe.</p><p>Since when does Luke smoke a pipe?</p><p>More important, what are we doing in Ireland?</p><p>Most important, why is that Tyrannosaurus rex charging toward us, teeth bared and hungry?</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>Oh NO!</p><p>No no no no no!!!!!</p><p>This can\u2019t be happening.</p><p>Somehow, from deep in my consciousness, I realize that I\u2019m asleep. I know this sweater-wearing, smoking, Irish Luke is not the real Luke, the one that already I can\u2019t remember. The thought of him is barely out of reach, but it\u2019s gone nonetheless. Like something you were going to say but forgot and can\u2019t quite grasp again.</p><p>I reach into the pockets of my dream apron and search frantically for the note that I haven\u2019t left myself. It\u2019s not there in my dream; it will not be there when I awaken.</p><p>There is no note.</p><p>There will be no memory.</p><p>Real Luke is gone.</p><p>18</p><p>\u201cWHERE AM I?\u201d I shout, terrified.</p><p>I sit up and pull the blanket to my chest. Whose blanket is this?</p><p>I take in my surroundings.</p><p>I\u2019m in a van.</p><p>I\u2019m in a van with a strange guy.</p><p>I strain my neck to peek out the window and realize that I\u2019m in the middle of nowhere. In a van! Rapists drive vans! Wondering if I\u2019ve been violated, I concentrate on my private parts for any indication of wrongdoing. The parts seem to have remained private, but I can\u2019t be sure.</p><p>Hysteria creeps through my veins and I scream again, louder this time. \u201cWHERE AM I?\u201d</p><p>The stranger startles awake.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he croaks, staring at me like I\u2019m crazy. He blinks his eyes a couple of times, and then shakes his head like he\u2019s waking from a bad dream. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is going\u2014\u201d He sits up and looks out the window. \u201cNo!\u201d he shouts. \u201cOh, no! This is baaaaaaaad. It\u2019s light out!\u201d</p><p>Obviously, I think but don\u2019t vocalize. I don\u2019t want to poke the bear.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d he asks under his breath. He is furiously trying to untangle himself from his half of the blanket I\u2019m holding, so I let it go. He succeeds, and pushes a button to open the sliding door next to him. He hops out of the van, closes the sliding door, and throws himself into the driver\u2019s seat. In moments, the van roars to life.</p><p>\u201cWe gotta go,\u201d he says, adjusting the rearview mirror. \u201cAre you riding back there?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>I consider that it might be easier to jump from the passenger seat if need be, so I move to the front of the van. I keep my hand firmly wrapped around the door handle as mystery boy backs away from a barbed-wire fence and toward a dirt road.</p><p>\u201cLondon, are you okay?\u201d he asks, once we\u2019ve turned onto a paved residential road. At least he knows my name. And he looks to be my age. It\u2019s possible that I managed to willingly get myself into this situation, and then forgot to write a note.</p><p>\u201cLondon?\u201d he asks, looking at me with eyes I didn\u2019t know anyone other than movie stars possessed. His voice sounds almost fearful. This calms me slightly, which is good, because I think I\u2019m approaching a major panic attack.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I answer, before looking away from him and out the window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he says. When I don\u2019t respond, he adds, \u201cYour mom must be really strict, huh? I hope you aren\u2019t in serious trouble.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re silent as we ride, and then we\u2019re turning off the highway toward my housing development. My shoulders begin to relax with the realization that this stranger is at least driving me home. The terror has subsided. I must know this person; I just need to get home and ask my mom who he is or look in my spiral notebooks to figure it out.</p><p>And then, new terror sets in when I consider that sleeping in the middle of nowhere in vans with strange boys isn\u2019t something my mother will condone. Nor is coming home at\u2014what time is it, anyway?\u20147:14 in the morning. As the boy rounds the street corner to my house, I can almost see it breathing with motherly rage.</p><p>We\u2019re barely into the driveway before the front door flings open and my mom is rushing to meet me. The car hasn\u2019t stopped before she begins tugging at the door handle.</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d the boy whispers as he struggles to put the van in park so that the automatic locks will release. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, London,\u201d he says once again, and I feel bad for him this time.</p><p>\u201cBoth of you, in the house!\u201d my mom barks at me and the stranger. He tentatively turns off the engine and unbuckles his seat belt. I mimic his movements and follow him and my mom inside. My mom storms through the front entryway to the living room and stops abruptly in the center of the room.</p><p>\u201cSit!\u201d she orders when we hover on the fringe. I take a seat on the far edge of the chocolate leather couch, and the boy sits in the middle. He leaves a decent amount of space between us but doesn\u2019t wimp out by sitting at the opposite end. The guy has guts.</p> <p>\u201cFirst of all, let me just state the obvious,\u201d my mom begins, with measured restraint. \u201cYou\u2019re both grounded.\u201d I wonder how my mom has the authority to ground Mr. Mystery, but she continues. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the phone all night with your mother and father, Luke.\u201d</p><p>Luke? Nice name.</p><p>Mom goes on. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that I had to meet new members of our community under these circumstances. But I think that you\u2019ll find your father\u2019s current state even more unfortunate. He was out looking for the two of you all night. He is not happy.\u201d</p><p>Luke groans next to me and hangs his head.</p><p>The berating continues. \u201cI\u2019ll call them on your way home so they know you\u2019re safe. But first, will one of you please tell me where on earth you were this whole night? I tried to call and text a million times.\u201d</p><p>I take out my cell and find five texts and eight missed calls. \u201cI turned it off,\u201d I mutter, looking down. As I replace the phone in my pocket, Mom folds her arms across her chest and the room grows silent. I look at Luke. He raises his eyebrows expectantly, as if he thinks I\u2019m going to explain the situation to my mother. As if I can explain the situation to my mother. He has no idea.</p><p>I am mute.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d he whispers at me harshly before turning to face my mom.</p> <p>\u201cWe were out past Old Fox Road, just north of town,\u201d he says. \u201cI planned this whole dinner-and-a-movie thing. My minivan has a DVD player and we ate pizza and looked at the stars. It was no big deal... until I guess we fell asleep. I\u2019m really sorry, Mrs. Lane.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he hisses at me when he glances my way and sees my openmouthed stare.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I missed what might have been my best date ever.</p><p>I turn to my mom, mouth still slightly ajar, and the ice melts. I see in her eyes the realization. She understands now that I don\u2019t remember the evening. Keeping up the fa\u00e7ade for Luke\u2019s benefit, she asks, \u201cIs that true, London?\u201d Her look tells me to agree.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I breathe, finding myself desperate to be alone with Luke and have him retell every minute of the night. Judging by his expression of sour lemons with a dash of confusion, I doubt he\u2019s interested in reliving the fun just yet. I doubt that I told him anything about my faulty wiring. I doubt it, but I can\u2019t be sure.</p><p>My mom speaks again. \u201cOkay, then. Because I trust my daughter, and because you seem like you come from a nice family, Luke, I choose to believe that this was an honest mistake, and we\u2019ll leave it at that. I don\u2019t love the fact that the two of you were so far out of town alone, but I can\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t explore the outskirts of the area a time or two myself when I was your age.\u201d</p><p>My mom smiles, and Luke\u2019s expression is now confused. He doesn\u2019t understand why this woman has just turned compassionate. She puts on her Tough Mom hat again and adds, in a harsher tone, \u201cBut you\u2019re still grounded. Luke, you\u2019d better get home; your parents are worried.\u201d</p><p>With that, she leaves the room and heads to the kitchen. I know that this is her way of letting me say good-bye to Luke without her watchful eye on us.</p><p>I walk him to the door. Before he leaves, he turns and eyes me skeptically.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened back there?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I begin, because I am. \u201cI just froze. I\u2019ve never done anything like this before.\u201d I say it because I think it\u2019s true.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m some degenerate or something. My parents are going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d I say again, stepping closer to him. He grabs my hand and smiles down at me through his thick eyelashes, and my heart sputters.</p><p>\u201cWas it worth it?\u201d he asks seriously.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, looking up at him. Standing here, holding the hand of this gorgeous being even for these few moments, is worth every bit of it. \u201cDo you think so?\u201d I ask in return.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d he says, brushing a strand of hair from my face. He bends down and lightly skims my lips with his, then whispers in my ear, \u201cSee you soon, prom queen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>19</p><p>It\u2019s 2:39 in the morning.</p><p>My heart is racing.

Still not speaking. Try asking her to help with finding Dad (read back and look in the big envelope in the desk). Also, try to think of a plan to help end her tragic relationship.</p><p>Mom. See the big envelope mentioned above.</p><p>Luke. SUPERHOT BOYFRIEND! He\u2019ll be there before school with coffee and food of some sort; don\u2019t worry about breakfast. Dating almost three and a half months. Supergood kisser. Flip through notes and check out the photos all over the room. See Saturday\u2019s note about a party at his friend Adam\u2019s house. Today, we went to the movie Elephant Bride and it was really stupid but the day was fun anyway. I beat him at a fighting video game before the movie. I was the Red Warrior.</p><p>Held hands the whole movie and shared popcorn; he called me a popcorn hog. Went to his house after and he played his guitar for me for a while until Mom called and told me to come home for dinner. We kissed before I got out of the car. Yum. Oh, he drives a minivan\u2014 don\u2019t hold it against him.</p><p>20</p><p>What I\u2019m really thinking right now is \u201cwhoa.\u201d What comes out of my mouth, miraculously, is a simple, sultry, \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey yourself,\u201d he says, backlit and beautiful, standing on my porch with a lidded coffee cup in his hand. I can see his breath in the frigid air as it escapes his mouth.</p> <p>There is something overwhelming about the moment. His unwavering gaze, effortless smile, and obvious ease, combined with the February sunrise, make me feel like my legs might give out underneath me.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asks gently.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I say, in a measured tone that I\u2019m surprised I\u2019m capable of using. I follow him from the porch to the minivan idling in the driveway.</p><p>I thought I was prepared.</p><p>This morning, I read months of notes. I flipped through dozens of photos.</p><p>But Luke in real life is something else.</p><p>Luke in real life is something no amount of notes could prepare me for. My living, breathing boyfriend is amazing.</p><p>Trying to act as if I remember being here before, I slide into the passenger seat and buckle my belt. Once I\u2019m settled, Luke gestures to a coffee waiting for me in the passenger cup holder.</p><p>\u201cThere are muffins in the console,\u201d he says casually as he backs out of the driveway. I open the compartment between us to find breakfast from what will be my favorite bakery until it goes out of business in a few years.</p><p>I know from notes that this has become our ritual: Luke driving me to school each day, often surprising me with morning treats. But thanks to my lack of proper memory, it feels like a first for me today, and I love it.</p><p>\u201cJamie ever call you back yesterday?\u201d Luke asks as he drives. My notes didn\u2019t say I called her, but they would have if she\u2019d called back.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, pretty sure that I\u2019m telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cBummer.\u201d</p><p>Too soon, we\u2019re pulling into the student lot. Even though we\u2019re one of the first cars there, Luke turns into a space in the back row.</p><p>\u201cEasy escape,\u201d he says when I look at him quizzically. He puts the gearshift in park but leaves the engine running and the heat pumping. I wonder whether Luke always parks in the back and make a mental note to include that tonight so I don\u2019t wonder again.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. If anything, I\u2019m hot in this jacket.\u201d</p><p>He turns down the blower.</p><p>\u201cYour hair looks good like that,\u201d he says, as easily as someone I\u2019ve been dating for a while might. He takes a slow sip of his coffee, and I find myself wishing my own nearly empty cup would magically refill itself.</p><p>I grab a smooth strand of hair. I must have flat-ironed it last night; I didn\u2019t wash it this morning.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, gazing into his blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s new?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I have no idea, so I talk about my best friend some more. \u201cI\u2019m worried about Jamie,\u201d I begin cryptically, hoping to draw out information if I\u2019ve already discussed this particular issue with Luke. According to my notes, I haven\u2019t. Then again, notes could be wrong.</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d Luke asks innocently, taking another drink. The parking lot is starting to fill around us, but we are in our own world.</p><p>\u201cCan I tell you something in confidence?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOf course. You know you can trust me, London.\u201d</p><p>I do know that, I think to myself.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I begin. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says, as if it\u2019s a given.</p><p>I sit for a moment, looking into Luke\u2019s expectant eyes, trying to think of a way to buffer what I\u2019m going to say. Instead, I finally just blurt it out. \u201cJamie is having an affair with a teacher. A married teacher.\u201d</p><p>Luke doesn\u2019t make a sound, but his jaw drops slightly, and then he recovers. \u201cWow,\u201d he says, clearly letting the news settle in his brain.</p><p>\u201cI tried to talk her out of it, but she\u2019s too stubborn to listen,\u201d I continue.</p><p>\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cIt started around the time we met.\u201d</p><p>I think I see a speck of hurt flash across his eyes\u2014maybe because I didn\u2019t tell him sooner. I\u2019m surprised myself that I haven\u2019t, but it\u2019s not really my secret to tell. And here now, sharing it anyway, I can\u2019t help but feel a bit guilty.</p><p>\u201cWhich teacher?\u201d Luke asks, and all at once I\u2019m defensive.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, calm down,\u201d he snaps back, making me wonder whether we\u2019re going to have our first fight. \u201cJust asking,\u201d he says, looking toward the line of cars pulling into the lot.</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s just a sensitive subject. No matter how stupid she is sometimes, Jamie is still my best friend. But I didn\u2019t mean to bite your head off.\u201d Luke looks back into my eyes and smiles. I can see we\u2019re okay, but just to make sure, I add, \u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Rice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriver\u2019s Ed.?\u201d Luke asks. I nod.</p><p>\u201cI guess I can see that,\u201d Luke says. \u201cHe\u2019s young and all. At least it\u2019s not Mr. Ellis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw, gross!\u201d I squeal, and we chuckle a little at something that really isn\u2019t that funny, but it lightens the mood just the same.</p><p>A car parks in the space on Luke\u2019s side and two girls get out, looking enviously at him and then scowling at me. As they walk toward the school, I remember that one of them is going to get pregnant at the end of next year. I feel like shouting after her, \u201cUse protection!\u201d</p><p>Instead, I keep the conversation going.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know what to do. I want to find a way to end their relationship without having Jamie know it was me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat, you mean like telling on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way, yes,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she gets in trouble?\u201d he asks softly. Luke drains his coffee cup and I admire his profile.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that. But I want it to stop, and Jamie isn\u2019t willing to listen to me. In fact, she\u2019s not even speaking to me because I told her that I was worried.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a tough one,\u201d Luke says sincerely.</p><p>\u201cI know. But I\u2019ll figure it out. There\u2019s got to be a way,\u201d I say more to myself than to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you however I can,\u201d he replies, even though I think he knows I was talking to myself, too.</p><p>Luke grabs my hand over the center compartment and squeezes it gently. The lot is nearly full now.</p><p>\u201cWe should go in,\u201d he says, sounding disappointed.</p> <p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d</p><p>He turns the key and the van is silent. I unbuckle my belt and yank my backpack off the floor in front of my feet. Opening the door, I feel a frigid blast of wind that\u2019s in stark contrast to the warmth of the van. I hop out, slam the door, and shiver my way to the front of the car to meet Luke. He looks unfazed.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he replies with a shrug. \u201cThis is no match for the Charles,\u201d he adds, confusing me.</p><p>Luke grabs my hand and we walk quickly toward the building. His fingers are calloused, and I wonder if it\u2019s from playing guitar.</p><p>Halfway through the lot, a car is pulling into one of the few vacant spots. It is a blue four-door sedan that someone\u2019s mother might drive. Then I realize that Brad from math is driving it. I wave. He glares at me in return.</p> <p>What I did to Brad to provoke such disdain, I have no idea. But right now, walking hand in hand with my perfect boyfriend on a sunny, crisp February morning, I don\u2019t care about Brad from math.</p><p>I don\u2019t care about anything at all, except Luke.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t switch partners?\u201d Jamie asks Ms. Garcia, none too discreetly. A few of our classmates are staring at me to gauge my reaction.</p><p>\u201cMs. Connor, as I\u2019ve told you now a half-dozen times, the partner you chose at the beginning of the year is the partner you will have until the end. I don\u2019t want to hear another word about it.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Garcia turns her back on Jamie and starts writing today\u2019s class agenda on the whiteboard. Jamie rolls her eyes and trudges back to her desk, which she picks up and plunks down with a loud bang so that it\u2019s facing mine.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she mutters as she flops into her seat.</p><p>\u201cHi, J,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me,\u201d she snaps.</p> <p>\u201cI have to: we have an assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen only talk to me in Spanish,\u201d she commands.</p><p>\u201cHola, Jamie,\u201d I say as a joke. She doesn\u2019t laugh, opting to roll her eyes again instead. I decide to try a new tack, courtesy of this morning\u2019s note.</p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cAsk your precious Luke for help,\u201d Jamie says loudly, without looking up from our assignment.</p><p>\u201cI want to track down my dad.\u201d</p><p>Jamie flinches a little. Her face softens. Still, her response is bitter: \u201cGoogle him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried,\u201d I say, without knowing whether I have already.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so transparent,\u201d Jamie says, still not looking at me. Not sure what she means, I keep quiet. She sighs, and glares right into my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to be all casual, but what you really want is for me to look in my mom\u2019s files, right?\u201d she asks, acting put out. And yet, there\u2019s a slight softness to her tone; I know I\u2019ve got her. I can\u2019t pinpoint why, but Jamie will always agree to help me. Maybe she figures I\u2019m lost without her. In many ways, I am.</p><p>Still, I have no idea what files she\u2019s talking about.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019re getting at? You want me to look up your dad\u2019s information in my mom\u2019s legal files?\u201d</p><p>The word legal makes it click. Jamie\u2019s mom will be a divorce lawyer for many years; she probably handled my parents\u2019 split. Letting Jamie assume this was my plan all along, I agree.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me,\u201d I say, looking as sheepish as possible without actually feeling that way. \u201cListen, Jamie, I know you\u2019re mad at me and that\u2019s fine, but this is important. I don\u2019t remember my father at all. You know that. But I want to, and I really need your help. Will you help me?\u201d</p><p>Sure, I started the conversation to get Jamie to talk to me, but ultimately, I do want to find my dad. This is the best of both worlds.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jamie says with a shrug, before refocusing on our assignment.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whisper across the table island at her.</p><p>She ignores me completely for the rest of the class.</p><p>21</p><p>It\u2019s nearly bedtime, and my mom is still out showing houses. Despite being angry with her about what she\u2019s been hiding from me, I feel sorry for her for having to be out so late.</p><p>Pajama-clad, face washed, and teeth brushed, I retrieve the envelope from my desk drawer. The metal clasp is worn from being opened and closed many times.</p><p>I know I found the items inside three and a half months ago. I know I haven\u2019t done much with the information.</p><p>Emptying the photos and cards onto my bedspread, I slowly, meticulously look through them. Vacation photos, shots in the backyard, holidays. We seem happy.</p><p>Looking at my father\u2019s face, I can\u2019t help but recall the one memory I have of him from the future. The one that plagues me.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how I got there. I\u2019m just there, among dozens of mourners experiencing various states of grief.</p><p>The brick wall of a man holds back his tears, the younger man with the eighties hairstyle weeps freely. Wet from the rain, stricken with grief, my grandmother crumbles. Beside me, my mother sobs, looking young... vulnerable. A woman in a low-cut dress tries to keep her composure, probably for the sake of the small boy in front of her. Footsteps crowd the muddy path like bread crumbs leading to sadness. Even the stone statue to my left cries for the unknown guest of honor.</p><p>I grab my notebook and read back about how I used to think it was my father\u2019s funeral. I scoff at myself now, remembering my father arriving late, standing near the back\u2014far from both my mother and his own\u2014and fighting back emotion as the priest I can\u2019t hear delivers his message.</p><p>I remember willing myself to look away, and seeing the caretaker in the distance, watching us. Watching me.</p><p>He\u2019s standing in front of a toolshed disguised as a mausoleum and he smiles. It\u2019s not an all-out smile; it\u2019s the one you use when you want to make someone feel better and smiling is all you can do.</p><p>It makes me want to run over and kick him, but I don\u2019t. Instead, I stare back until he tosses his cigarette to the ground and saunters inside the shed.</p><p>The funeral is over and my father is gone.</p><p>Grandma is gone.</p><p>Everyone is gone.</p><p>And still, even as I turn to follow my mother, I can\u2019t see the grave. Try as I might, I can\u2019t look down. Somewhere deep inside, I won\u2019t let myself remember who is in the hole in the ground.</p><p>My thoughts turn to Luke. Is it him?</p><p>It can\u2019t be him.</p><p>Why would my father return after years of absence to attend a funeral for my boyfriend? And my grandmother? It doesn\u2019t fit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s not Luke.</p><p>And yet, when I flip through my spiral-bound substitute for a proper memory again, one truth becomes clear: the darkest memory showed up when he did.</p><p>Exhausted from the day and the weight of what\u2019s coming, I gather the photos and cards before me into a neat stack and ease them back inside the manila envelope. I fold down the clasp to hold it shut, replace it inside the desk drawer, and set my notes on my nightstand.</p><p>After scooting under the covers, I reread the note I left myself, just to make sure everything\u2019s there. I add a few details about the memory, and a question: How is Luke involved?</p> <p>The garage door begins to open; my mom is home. Instead of waiting to say good night, I put the note on my nightstand, click off the lamp, and roll to my side, facing the wall.</p><p>Two questions volley back and forth in my mind:</p><p>Why can\u2019t I remember Luke?</p><p>Whose funeral is it?</p><p>I\u2019m watching the tennis match with my eyes closed when my mom eeks open my door and whispers, barely audibly, \u201cGood night, sweet London.\u201d</p> <p>Her words are like a sleeping pill; they instantly relax me.</p><p>Soon, the tennis match is over.</p><p>It\u2019s love\u2013love.</p><p>No resolution.</p><p>22</p><p>Walking alone from the locker room to the gymnasium, I am lamenting the fact that it\u2019s Thursday. Thursdays are odd-block days: ninety minutes each of my least favorite classes.</p> <p>No Luke to enjoy.</p><p>Then again, no Jamie, either.</p><p>I am pondering what to do about Jamie as I lean into the bar across the middle of the massive gym door and set foot onto the gleaming court. It\u2019s loud and alive with squeaking sneakers and shouts and pants, and the sensory overload distracts me to the point that I don\u2019t see it coming.</p><p>Before I have time to jump, duck, or even flinch, my thoughts are obliterated by the weight of a massive rubber ball slamming into the right side of my face. The momentum knocks me sideways and then off balance. I trip over my own feet and fall, without even a smidgen of grace, to the ground.</p><p>A loud, embarrassing \u201coof\u201d comes out of my mouth as my hip hits the floor first, followed by my ribs, and then my head. My right ear rings and my cheek tingles and burns at the same time; hand to cheek, I realize that the rubber ball left a pattern on my skin.</p><p>I brush the hair that I haven\u2019t had the chance to pull back into a ponytail from my face, then blink once to clear the water from my eyes. With one good ear and only partial vision, I experience the fallout.</p><p>Everyone in first-period PE is laughing at me. Some try to hide it; others are actually pointing in my direction. Jerks. I struggle to get back on my feet, but my senses are still off, and it\u2019s a lot more difficult than it should be. I feel a little drunk, and, yes, I know what that feels like. I remember it.</p><p>Once I finally make it to my feet and the crowd begins to scatter, my eyes catch Page Thomas\u2019s. There\u2019s a nasty smirk on her face as she quickly looks away. Before I have too much time to dwell on it, a shrill whistle blows. Ms. Martinez commands the room, and I grudgingly join one of two teams.</p> <p>For the rest of the period, I try to defend myself as best I can through an excruciating \u201cgame\u201d that should be banned from high school and general play forever.</p><p>It is nothing but pain and humiliation.</p><p>It should be avoided at all costs.</p><p>It is the reason this morning\u2019s note warned: stay alert first period.</p><p>It is hell on earth.</p><p>It is dodgeball.</p><p>Hours later, during Ms. Harris\u2019s lecture on the hippocampus in Human Anatomy, Ryan Greene keeps glancing at me from across the aisle. My face and ego still sting from this morning, but I\u2019m smiling and I can\u2019t stop. It hurts my cheeks, and Ryan is gawking\u2014probably because the hippocampus isn\u2019t that exciting\u2014but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>I saw Luke before class.</p><p>\u201cSomething funny, London?\u201d Ms. Harris interrupts. She\u2019s stopped writing midsentence and is holding the blue dry-erase marker in midair. One of her perfectly curvy hips is popped to the side, and a manicured hand rests there, waiting.</p><p>She looks a little like one of the cheerleaders did earlier today. That\u2019s concerning, seeing as how Ms. Harris is a teacher and all. Shouldn\u2019t she reserve judgment?</p><p>Though I\u2019m fairly certain that the majority of them are as bored by the anatomy of the brain as I am, the students in my line of sight now look annoyed at the interruption. More likely, they\u2019re just annoyed Ms. Harris turned around.</p><p>\u201cLondon? Is there a joke?\u201d she asks again when I don\u2019t speak. She tosses her dyed red hair and I wonder if she\u2019s jealous that mine is real.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ms. Harris,\u201d I say quietly. I try to think of something depressing, but the smile hangs on.</p><p>Ms. Harris stares at me, unblinking, for what feels like days. When she seems convinced that I\u2019m either a bad seed or insane, she sighs and turns back to the whiteboard.</p><p>The rest of the students right themselves on their stools, and I relax, too. I take a deep breath of stale science-wing air and loosen my grip on the metal table.</p><p>My happy moment ruined, I focus on what Ms. Harris is saying, most of it completely snore-inducing. But then, she says something that grabs my interest.</p><p>\u201c... possible that we store different types of memories in different parts of our brains.\u201d</p><p>Intrigued, I sit up a little straighter. I need to hear what she\u2019ll say next.</p><p>She turns and writes \u201cTypes of memories\u201d on the whiteboard. Just as she\u2019s underlining her header, the bell rings.</p><p>\u201cClass dismissed.\u201d</p><p>A little over an hour later, Mom is driving in the opposite direction of home, looking determined.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut for a snack,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d I protest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to eat. But I think we need to spend some time together.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>Mom pulls into a diner and parks, and we walk inside and seat ourselves as the sign instructs. Once the waitress has taken our drink orders\u2014diet for Mom, regular for me\u2014Mom strikes up a conversation.</p><p>\u201cGood day?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>The waitress delivers our drinks, and my mom unwraps our straws and puts them in the glasses. She takes a sip as she waits for me to respond.</p><p>\u201cI got hit in the face with a ball in gym,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says. Another sip. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarley Lynch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she do this time?\u201d Mom asks.</p><p>\u201cShe just made some comment about my outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou know she\u2019s just jealous of you, London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know, Mom. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Jamie there?\u201d my mom asks casually.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cStill fighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d I say, rolling my eyes.</p><p>A family scoots into the next booth over, and I watch them settle themselves as my mom speaks in a quieter tone. For that I\u2019m grateful.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to get snippy, sweetie. Jamie will come around; she always does. And Carley is jealous because of a boy. Christopher something. They went out for a while and broke up, then you asked him to a dance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI asked a boy to a dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a turnabout dance where the girls ask the boys.

Anyway, you weren\u2019t interested in him after that one date, but Carley\u2019s always held a grudge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe used to talk more,\u201d Mom says, with a hurt look in her eyes. I\u2019m guilty of putting it there. I don\u2019t say anything back.</p> <p>The waitress returns and asks what we\u2019d like to eat. Mom orders a plate of onion rings for us to share; I love onion rings. The waitress moves to the next table over, and I watch the father order for his family. I\u2019m aware of my envy as he chats with his daughter and son.</p><p>\u201cWhen did Dad leave?\u201d I ask my mom out of the blue. Her eyes grow wide as she swallows the soda she\u2019s just sipped.</p><p>\u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d she asks. I shrug.</p><p>\u201cIs that what\u2019s been bothering you lately? You want to know about your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say.</p> <p>Mom fidgets in her seat a little and then clears her throat.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says softly. \u201cI\u2019ve told you this before and I\u2019ll tell you again. Your father and I weren\u2019t meant to be together. We didn\u2019t get along, and he left when you were six. That\u2019s really the end of the story.\u201d</p><p>I think back to my notes.</p><p>\u201cMy memory went crazy when I was six. Do you think Dad leaving us traumatized me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve considered that,\u201d Mom admits, looking incredibly uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cSo, what, you just fell out of love with each other?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>My mom doesn\u2019t meet my gaze when she replies, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we never heard from him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says. The letters at home tell me that she\u2019s lying, but I hide my anger. I press the issue.</p><p>\u201cHe never tried to talk to me or anything?\u201d</p><p>I swear I see a flash of guilt in my mother\u2019s eyes when she answers. \u201cNo, honey, I\u2019m sorry, he never did.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t believe you, I think.</p><p>And then our onion rings arrive.</p><p>When I get home, I try calling Jamie. She picks up on the third ring.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to stop stalking me,\u201d she says sharply.</p><p>\u201cHi to you, too,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, I got your message earlier. I\u2019ve gotten all of your messages. When I\u2019m ready to talk to you, I\u2019ll call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Jamie, don\u2019t you think we should just talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you even remember what it is, London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say quietly. My notes are resting on my lap.</p><p>\u201cBut not really,\u201d Jamie snaps at me. \u201cSee, you get to go to sleep and forget everything. I don\u2019t have that luxury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a luxury,\u201d I protest.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, I have to go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, J, are we ever going to talk again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, London, are we?\u201d</p><p>Click.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Luke asks over the phone.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I lie.</p><p>\u201cNo, really, what is it? I can hear it in your voice.\u201d</p><p>I smile weakly. Why can\u2019t I remember you?</p><p>\u201cBad day,\u201d I reply, shrugging, though he can\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Luke presses. I decide to let him in a little.</p><p>\u201cMy mom and I aren\u2019t really getting along, and she made me go and talk about my feelings after school. Then I tried to call Jamie and she basically cut me off and hung up on me. I\u2019m really sick of her drama,\u201d I say bitterly, remembering forward to what I would consider some unnecessarily long arguments in the future. \u201cShe\u2019s just so self-absorbed. Everything is about her. It drives me crazy sometimes!\u201d</p><p>Luke laughs a little.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I reply angrily.</p><p>\u201cNothing, I\u2019ve just never heard you mad. It\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not cute!\u201d I playfully shout at him. He laughs harder, and I join in. When we stop, Luke asks, \u201cSeriously, though, what can I do to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just nice to talk to you,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cThis helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t call sooner,\u201d Luke says softly, sending chills down my spine. \u201cI was painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal,\u201d I say, shrugging again. \u201cI was eating onion rings and talking about feelings with my mom anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about the...\u201d Luke abruptly stops talking on the other end of the phone. \u201cJust a second,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I hear Luke\u2019s hand moving over the mouthpiece, and then a woman\u2019s muffled voice. Luke\u2019s reply is louder but equally jumbled.</p><p>Soon enough, he\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, returning to the conversation. \u201cThat was my mom. She wants me to get off the phone. She said it\u2019s too late to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, trying not to sound disappointed, even though I know that my mom would feel the same way. \u201cOkay, I guess we can catch up tomorrow then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Luke says.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet dreams, London.\u201d</p><p>He disconnects the call.</p><p>In the darkness, I stare at my phone for a few minutes, reveling in the warm feeling I got from the short conversation with Luke. I know I need to add details of the call to the note on my nightstand, but I don\u2019t want to move just yet.</p><p>When I\u2019ve finally willed myself to turn on the light and spoil my Zen moment, my annoying ringtone sounds again, and my heart leaps.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I say quickly.</p><p>\u201cI forgot to tell you that you looked really pretty today,\u201d Luke says in a whisper.</p><p>In the darkness, I feel my face flush.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>For a few seconds, we are quiet. Every muscle in my body is tense, in a good way; it\u2019s excruciatingly intimate. I\u2019m lying in my bed, clutching the phone like a lifeline, hearing nothing but Luke\u2019s measured inhale and exhale and my own quickening heartbeat.</p><p>If he were here right now, I\u2019d kiss him. \u201cWell, I guess I should go. My mom might come back,\u201d Luke whispers, breaking the moment.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I answer, unable to say more.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cOkay, bye, Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, London,\u201d he says before hanging up, the sound of my name from his lips sending chills through me again.</p><p>I clutch the phone to my chest and exhale sharply, then sit up and snap on the small lamp at my bedside. I update tonight\u2019s note, and, as I\u2019m doing so, my own mom pops her head into my room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m finishing up,\u201d I answer, without looking at her.</p><p>\u201cSleep tight,\u201d Mom says.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, London,\u201d she says.</p><p>I sigh deeply and say halfheartedly, \u201cI love you, too.\u201d My eyes are still on my paper.</p><p>I resume writing, and sometime before I finish chronicling my call with Luke and turn out the light, my mom silently disappears.</p><p>23</p><p>Across the aisle from me, Jamie\u2019s floral shoulder bag is packed and ready. There are five minutes left in class, and she\u2019s making no effort to appear like she\u2019s still paying attention. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wonder whether she\u2019s trying to get detention again.</p><p>The thought makes me sick.</p><p>Jamie has successfully ignored me all period, a task made easier by the fact that today wasn\u2019t a lab day. No partnering. No practice drills. No joint assignments.</p><p>No speaking to each other.</p> <p>The bell rings, and Jamie stands so quickly, it makes me jump. She turns to face me and plunks something down on my desk.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she says, then turns and exits the classroom.</p><p>In fifteen seconds, the room is empty. Even Ms. Garcia is in her attached office, prepping for next period.</p><p>Slowly, I unfold the small piece of ripped notebook paper. There is no note; no nothing. Just a phone number.</p><p>I know what it is, though.</p> <p>Even mad at me, Jamie came through.</p><p>Now it\u2019s up to me to decide whether or not I want to contact my father.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I can be fixed?\u201d</p><p>My mom looks at me sharply, surprised. We\u2019ve been eating dinner, up until this point, in silence.</p><p>\u201cFixed?\u201d she asks. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that you\u2019re broken. You\u2019re special.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at her G-rated look on life.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever, Mom,\u201d I reply curtly.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you think of this?\u201d Mom asks, ignoring my tone.</p><p>\u201cAnatomy,\u201d I reply. I take a bite of chicken and then continue. \u201cMs. Harris talked about storing different memories in different parts of the brain. Easy stuff, like knowing your name or riding a bike or math, goes in one place; experience-type memories go in another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say math is easy,\u201d Mom jokes. It annoys me.</p><p>\u201cIt is for me,\u201d I say sharply. \u201cMaybe your math is stored in the harder part. Anyway, that\u2019s not the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Mom says. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously that means that only one part of my brain is messed up. Not all of it. So I\u2019m wondering if I can have the messed-up part fixed.\u201d</p><p>And then I\u2019ll know what happened in the past, I think, but don\u2019t say. And maybe I\u2019ll stop remembering what\u2019s going to happen in the future, too.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it works that way,\u201d Mom says quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cBecause one of the experts we\u2019ve seen is a neurologist. Do you know what that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dense, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon, I\u2019ve about had enough of your tone. I was just going to say that he had an MRI done on your brain, and nothing looked out of the ordinary. He said that your brain is perfectly healthy. No parts are \u2018messed up.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI\u2019m finished.\u201d</p><p>I push back from the table, take my plate to the sink, and leave my mom to finish eating alone, which only bugs me every step of the way upstairs.</p><p>24</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready,\u201d I whisper, even though whispering isn\u2019t necessary. We are totally alone.</p><p>Nearly inaudible music plays from Luke\u2019s bedroom stereo, and the late-afternoon sun is on the other side of the house, making the room dim.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d Luke asks. The hairs on my arms stand on end.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer quickly. Then I add, \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no rush,\u201d he offers. \u201cWe can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it has to be today,\u201d I say, in a bossier tone than I mean.</p><p>Luke laughs and picks up his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here goes,\u201d he says.</p><p>He dials the number from the scrap of paper, and I bite the fingernail on my right pointer finger in anticipation. I imagine one ring, then two, then...</p><p>Luke\u2019s eyes widen and his posture stiffens. Less than one second later, he relaxes again. He makes a face as he disconnects the call.</p><p>\u201cWrong number,\u201d he says, disappointed.</p><p>\u201cLike the voice mail was for someone else?\u201d I ask, needing clarification.</p><p>\u201cNo, like the number was disconnected. It might have been your dad\u2019s number way back when your parents divorced, but he\u2019s changed it since then.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, muffled squeals erupt from the direction of the kitchen, and Luke and I instinctively move to sit in beanbags. We know\u2014him from experience and me from my notes\u2014that his mother will come in without knocking to see what we\u2019re up to. Innocently crank-calling my estranged father might look questionable if we\u2019re doing it from Luke\u2019s bed.</p><p>In fact, anything done while lying on Luke\u2019s bed might be met with a raised eyebrow from Mrs. Henry, and a motherly inquisition is not what I need right now.</p><p>Luke clicks on the TV just in time for the interruption, and his mom finds us enjoying a documentary about ice fishing. She invites us to the kitchen for an afternoon snack, and we oblige because there\u2019s nothing left to do on the dad front for now.</p><p>After nachos, we settle into the oversized living room couch to be entertained by two matching almost-three-year-olds. I know I\u2019ve spent time with them before, so I try to hide my utter amazement at the carbon copies before me. How odd it must be to see yourself in someone else.</p><p>Luke\u2019s miniature sisters layer on every piece of dress-up clothing their little bodies will hold and act out a play about \u201cmonkeys and mommies at the zoo.\u201d We give them a standing ovation, and then explain to them what a standing ovation is.</p><p>Next up is a game of skill called \u201cline up the stuffed animals.\u201d Like little ants, the girls move from storage bin to line and back again, carrying armfuls of stuffed bears, elephants, giraffes, and more. Once completed, a Great Wall of \u201cStuffies\u201d extends from the fireplace to the arched doorway. After consulting each other for all of five seconds, they divide the territories: the left half of the living room, which includes the couch, is for \u201cbigs,\u201d while the right half is strictly for \u201cprincesses.\u201d</p><p>When Big Luke leaps off the couch and jumps into twin zone, he\u2019s met with screams and giggles and general joyousness that\u2019s contagious. I can\u2019t help but join in for a while, tickling and laughing with either Ella or Madelyn, I can\u2019t be sure.</p><p>Soon enough, it\u2019s nearing dinnertime, and Luke\u2019s father arrives wielding a massive box and a warm hello for all of us. Mr. Henry is a handsome man, and I can see Luke in him. For a moment, I let my mind wander, wondering whether Luke will have the same salt-and-pepper hair and lightly weathered face when he\u2019s his father\u2019s age.</p><p>Back in reality, the girls are opening the box with their father\u2019s help, and I can\u2019t help but feel a pang of jealousy at their relationship. I move to the couch and watch the simple moments that kids with fathers in their lives take for granted. One twin\u2019s tiny hand rests on her daddy\u2019s shoulder as he cuts open the top; another doll face lights up like it\u2019s Christmas morning as her father makes his way through packing peanuts and bubble wrap.</p><p>At its core, the box holds a handmade wooden rocking horse, painted pink and ready for riding.</p><p>But after one ride each, the real appeal is the massive, fortlike shipping box.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a car!\u201d the twin I think is Ella shouts right into Luke\u2019s face. Her eyes are so bright, how could he not help her inside and vroom her around the carpeted room? The girl that has to be Madelyn wants a ride, and Ella wants another. And now it\u2019s: \u201cMy car!\u201d \u201cNo, my car!\u201d \u201cNo, MINE!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clearly adept at solving minibattles, Mr. Henry disappears and then emerges again with a box cutter, some packing tape, and a handful of markers. Ten minutes later, there are two equally wonderful cars, each ready to transport its twin to \u201cthe mall,\u201d \u201cGrandma\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cschool,\u201d as she wishes.</p><p>Ella sits tall and holds tight to the sides, surveying the scenery in her imagination. Madelyn opts to lounge back in the car, making it more like a moving bed, which enables her to stare at the ceiling. As Luke scoots her by my feet, I giggle at her serene expression, and wonder what she could be thinking about while lying there staring up at the sky.</p><p>And then something happens. A piece snaps into place.</p><p>Luke stops his parade float and turns to face me.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just jumped, like something scared you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, GO!\u201d Madelyn commands from inside the box, when she realizes that her chariot has stopped.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d Luke says gently to his sister. \u201cJust a minute.\u201d She does as he says, and Luke eases off the floor. He sits down next to me on the couch and takes my hand.</p> <p>\u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d he asks softly. \u201cYou look really pale.\u201d He brushes a stray piece of hair out of my face, and I think I catch Mr. Henry grinning at us.</p><p>\u201cI feel sick,\u201d I say, louder than I mean to, grabbing the attention of two parents and twin toddlers. Now the whole Henry family is eyeing me, with varying degrees of curiosity and concern.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to lie down, London?\u201d Mrs. Henry says, in a way that makes me want to check my reflection. I can\u2019t look that bad.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay,\u201d I reply. \u201cI think I just need to go home.\u201d</p><p>Luke stands, and the twins protest in unison. Mrs. Henry quiets the girls, while Mr. Henry walks us to the door. Outside, I take a deep breath of freezing air, and, though it burns my lungs, it helps. Luke holds open the door of the van for me and kisses my cheek before he closes it.</p><p>We spend the ride in silence, Luke glancing at me every so often with concern on his face. When we pull into my driveway, he offers to come in.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, wanting nothing more than to run inside.</p><p>\u201cIs your mom home at least?\u201d he asks, squinting toward the lighted window in the dining room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she is,\u201d I say, turning and adding, \u201cthanks,\u201d before slamming the door without so much as a kiss. I jog up the porch steps before Luke has the chance to get out of the car. Once inside the house, I go straight up to my bedroom, close the door, and get in bed fully clothed. Pulling the covers up to my neck, I squeeze my eyes shut and try to control my erratic breathing. I let my mind go to the damp cemetery; I let myself feel that I am there, standing in the midst of a sea of black.</p><p>I know from my notes that I\u2019ve had some version of this funeral memory for a while. It has been building and growing in the depths of my brain, quietly reminding me that sometime, someone will die.</p><p>But until tonight, \u201csomeone\u201d is all I knew.</p><p>Then Luke\u2019s baby sister lying sweet and serene in a shipping box lit the fuse, and here I am seeing it plain as day: the smaller than usual hole in the ground before me, open wide and already swallowing a tiny coffin fit for the miniperson surely lying inside.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u201d is a child.</p><p>As if it couldn\u2019t get worse, another thought punches me in the gut and beats me down to the point where I consider I might never get up again.</p> <p>It\u2019s hazy\u2014a long time from now\u2014but I do remember being pregnant.</p><p>What if it\u2019s my child?</p><p>Isolated and terrified by what I remember, I pull the covers up tighter under my chin, because it\u2019s all I can think to do.</p><p>My mom isn\u2019t here; my dad is long gone. The only person in my life right now is a boy I can\u2019t remember. And someday in my future, I will bury a child.</p><p>It is all too much.</p><p>25</p><p>On the way to Spanish, I check out the Winter Formal posters peppering the hallways; the event is tomorrow night. I know from notes that Luke is taking me, and after spending the last class period with the boy I\u2019ve apparently been dating for nearly four months, I\u2019m fine with that.</p><p>Tense, but fine.</p><p>In Spanish, we have a substitute teacher, and Jamie partners with Amber Valentine for pronunciation drills, leaving me to fend for myself against an angry senior TA named Andi who clearly had other plans for the period. I\u2019m not sure what the prerequisites are for obtaining a teacher\u2019s assistant gig, but obviously they don\u2019t include being good at the subject you\u2019re assisting with; Andi\u2019s accent is worse than mine.</p><p>She\u2019s rolled her eyes at me seventeen times and counting, according to the scratch list on my notepad. My revenge is not telling her about the green food particle wedged between her two front teeth.</p><p>After class, I rush to catch up with Jamie.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, when she realizes that I\u2019m walking next to her toward the lunch hall.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says flatly.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d I ask, hoping to start mending fences.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she says, in an even flatter tone, if that\u2019s possible. This is not the day for reconciliation.</p><p>\u201cListen, Jamie, I just wanted to thank you,\u201d I offer.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d she asks, disinterested and avoiding eye contact. I think she just stepped farther away from me.</p><p>\u201cFor the number. My dad\u2019s,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Jamie says as she turns in the opposite direction and leaves me standing still in the middle of the busy hallway.</p><p>26</p><p>Squeaky-clean, and clothed in a red cocktail dress that shows a little more skin than feels natural today, I tap the tune of \u201cChopsticks\u201d on the antique table.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wreck your polish,\u201d my mom cautions from across the kitchen, nodding in the direction of my freshly painted nails. She\u2019s leaning against the counter, watching me as she sips tea from a steaming mug.</p><p>I stop tapping but don\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous about the dance?\u201d Mom asks, making conversation.</p><p>I hear the grandfather clock in the living room chime once for the half hour. He\u2019ll be here any minute.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I say, tossing a curl over my shoulder. In truth, it\u2019s not the dance I\u2019m nervous about. It\u2019s my life.</p><p>Trying to push away the darker thoughts, I focus on the notes before me, spread across the table like the diary of an amnesiac. I used the afternoon to study up on Luke as best I could, cramming more for this date than I will for the SAT later this year. Even still, I could forget something. That thought makes me uneasy; I read on.</p><p>My mom and I both jump at the sound of the doorbell.</p><p>\u201cWant me to get it?\u201d Mom asks when I stay frozen in my seat.</p><p>\u201cHuh? Oh, no, I\u2019ll go. I mean, I\u2019m dating him, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, you are,\u201d she says warmly. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a very nice boy. You look beautiful, London. Have fun tonight.\u201d</p><p>I walk toward the kitchen doorway as if my feet are lead and continue down the small hallway leading to the entryway. I turn right, open the door, and there he is.</p><p>There... he... is.</p><p>Luke.</p><p>Tall but not too tall, trim but not buff, perfect hair, glorious eyes, looking comfortable in his simple black suit, even though I know from the notes that he\u2019s more partial to rocker chic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019s holding a gigantic canvas with a bow wrapped around it.</p><p>\u201cInstead of a corsage,\u201d he says, offering me a painting of what appears to be my ear. I can see the shadow of the healed piercing that I\u2019ll reopen in college.</p><p>Wisps of just the right color hair tucked behind. The tiny pitch at the top.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your elf ear,\u201d Luke says, grinning. I can\u2019t help but laugh and self-consciously touch the body part in question.</p> <p>He takes a step closer. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite ear,\u201d he whispers into my left lobe, sending chills down my spine. He stands back again and regards my ensemble. \u201cYou look great,\u201d he says without hesitation. \u201cNice shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, grinning with my whole body. Most guys don\u2019t notice footwear. \u201cYou look nice, too. I expected a band T-shirt under your jacket or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw...\u201d Luke says with a laugh, showing off a prominent dimple on his right cheek.</p><p>I carefully lean the painting against the foyer wall and grab my coat. Luke offers me his hand, and just as we\u2019re ready to leave, my mom makes a perfectly timed appearance to wish us well. I could kiss her for being armed with a digital camera and for forcing us to stop and pose before we take off.</p><p>Luke leans over and gets the door for me, and once we\u2019re out of my mom\u2019s earshot, he bends down and whispers, \u201cThe dress is hot.\u201d</p> <p>Shivers run down my spine, and I am thrilled that I get to spend the whole night\u2014well, almost the whole night\u2014with him.</p><p>Luke drives to school, and because the dance is in the gym, we park in the teachers\u2019 lot. Even though it\u2019s allowed tonight, it feels scandalous.</p><p>Inside, the disco lights rage and the music is one notch higher than deafening. Scanning the room, I see Carley Lynch surrounded by Alex Morgan and some other cheerleaders, all wearing dresses so low-cut that I\u2019m embarrassed for them.</p><p>In the opposite corner, I spot Jamie just as her eyes catch mine. Our gazes hold steady for a moment, and then she looks away. In a lovely black dress, she is standing to the right of a boy I don\u2019t recognize.</p><p>A second passes before my hurt wanes and I remember that Jamie and I will continue to be friends long after this evening. She might not know it right now, but she doesn\u2019t hate me.</p><p>I follow her eye line, and my stomach lurches a little when I realize that now she\u2019s staring at Mr. Rice, who is chaperoning tonight. I consider that I might actually be sick when he gives her an inviting look no married teacher should ever throw in the direction of a sixteen-year-old girl.</p> <p>Luke must have noticed, too. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s dance,\u201d he says, before I can get lost in my thoughts.</p><p>We move to the center of the dance floor and are immediately awash in a sea of sparkling stars, courtesy of the disco ball. I drape my wrists over Luke\u2019s shoulders, and all at once, the strength of his arms around my waist, combined with the melodic song we\u2019re swaying to, makes me fantasize about marrying him.</p><p>This could be our song.</p><p>I let the smooth lyrics carry me away, and I enjoy the moment and the fantasy until it heads down the road toward children. And then the darkness is there, my mind asking questions I don\u2019t want to answer.</p><p>Is the dead child mine and Luke\u2019s? Is that why I don\u2019t remember him? Because what we share together will be too painful?</p><p>I pull Luke closer and smash my cheek into his shoulder, squeezing my eyes shut in an effort to make the darkness go away. Somehow he knows to hold tighter, too, and though he doesn\u2019t see the tear escape my eye, he rubs my back as if to say: \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>I never want to let go.</p><p>Luke and I dance like we\u2019re glued to each another for three slow songs, before the DJ speeds things up.</p> <p>My ears fill with a remixed version of a disco classic that will play at practically every wedding and party I\u2019ll attend for the rest of my life. The brave kids dance, while those who are either too cool or too awkward move to the outskirts. I\u2019m not sure which group we\u2019re in, but we slowly make our way to the fringe.</p><p>\u201cWant some punch?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be asking you that?\u201d Luke asks back.</p><p>I shrug and Luke agrees. \u201cI\u2019m going to say hi to Adam, but I\u2019ll meet you for a roll in the snow,\u201d he says, pointing to a group of benches decorated with fake snow.</p><p>Laughing and shaking my head, I walk to the punch table and grab two clear plastic cups. I wait my turn, fill them, and move to a snowy bench and sit down.</p><p>Gabby Stein, from PE, and her date, Christopher Osborne, are sitting on a bench two over from mine. Both look at me like I smell like dirty socks. Neither knows it yet, but Christopher will be valedictorian when we graduate next year.</p><p>Right now, however, despite looking uncannily like Superman, Christopher is nothing but a small, helpless animal that\u2019s fallen prey to Gabby\u2019s boa-constricting embrace. I can\u2019t help but long for the PDA police as I quickly look away and wish like crazy for Luke to hurry up.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Luke says when he finally settles in next to me. \u201cAdam\u2019s chatty tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d I say, handing Luke his punch. He chugs it and sets the cup in the snow next to a bunch of other empty cups littering the faux outdoors.</p><p>\u201cHaving fun?\u201d he asks. His eyes wander to the make-out session two benches down, and he quickly looks back at me.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I always have fun with you,\u201d I reply, feeling slightly guilty for my use of the word always.</p><p>\u201cDance not your scene, though?\u201d he prods, reading my mind.</p><p>I let out my breath and laugh. \u201cNot really, no. I mean, it was fun for a few minutes. The slow dances were nice. But these shoes are killing me and I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>He laughs with me, then stands and pulls me up with an easy swoop. \u201cLet\u2019s go, then,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me just run to the restroom first,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll wait for you by the doors,\u201d he replies, kissing me gently before I make my way to the girls\u2019 bathroom closest to the gym.</p><p>Inside, there are at least five girls admiring themselves in the massive mirror over the sinks. Without catching any eyes, I find an empty stall and then scoot through satin and tulle to a free sink.</p><p>Washing my hands, I feel someone\u2019s stare in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cI know you never asked him about me,\u201d Page Thomas says in her most accusatory voice.</p><p>This is why I should never come to social events: I am not social. I\u2019m definitely not going to prom.</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d I say, pretending not to have heard. Maybe I can stall her long enough so that I can dry my hands and leave.</p><p>\u201cYou should be,\u201d she says, eyes narrowed, face puckered. She spins around, her white-blonde hair trailing after her, and leaves the bathroom.</p><p>I\u2019m finished, and the other girls are now staring at me. So, I\u2019m forced to follow Page.</p><p>At the end of the hall, Luke is waiting for me. Brad is there, too, waiting for Page. Luke leans against the wall, looking like a suit model. Brad is staring curiously into the trophy case.</p><p>Luke\u2019s presence must have registered with Page, because she whips around and sees me behind her. She rolls her eyes at me, turns forward, and quickens her pace. When she reaches Brad, she grabs his hand and pulls him back inside the gym.</p><p>I can\u2019t be sure, but I think I hear her mutter a particularly unkind word about me as they go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaking friends tonight, huh?\u201d Luke says with a sympathetic smile. He is holding my coat open for me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he says, once I\u2019m wrapped and ready.</p><p>He grabs my hand, and we rush through the wind toward his minivan, away from it all. In the bitter darkness, my mind wanders to a question that, according to my notes, I\u2019ve been hoping to answer: Did I change anything with Page, or is she headed down the path toward embarrassment and heartbreak, courtesy of Brad from math?</p><p>Even though she clearly has it out for me, I silently hope that somehow Page\u2019s fate will be different from what I saw those months before. However nasty she may be, no one deserves that pain.</p> <p>27</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure she\u2019s not home?\u201d Luke whispers as he eyes the front of my house from the driver\u2019s seat of his van.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure,\u201d I reply at normal volume. \u201cWhy are you whispering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Luke whispers. He looks at me and flashes a huge, cheesy grin, turns back to the house, and says, \u201cI feel like she can hear me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not home!\u201d I yell, to prove the point.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at a movie,\u201d I answer flatly.</p><p>Suddenly, I\u2019m nervous. Luke and I have been dating for several months. Does he expect something? Do I?</p><p>Knowing that I could obsess to death about this, I decide to go for it and leap out of the van. Before I slam the door behind me, I turn to Luke and ask: \u201cAre you coming or what? I need a grilled cheese.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and kills the engine, then follows my lead. We\u2019re inside the warm entryway in no time, removing our jackets and shoes. I can\u2019t help but wonder what would happen if I just kept going, removing my dress....</p><p>\u201cShe left all the lights on. Are you sure she\u2019s not coming back soon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLuke! What are you so afraid of?\u201d I playfully shout at him. He\u2019s looking back toward the living room to make sure that my mom isn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I know I\u2019m being crazy. I just doubt your mom would want us here alone together this late at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, first of all, are you from the fifties or something? And second of all, it\u2019s not that late. It\u2019s only...\u201d I glance at the ornate wall clock mounted over the piano in the adjacent room. \u201cIt\u2019s not even nine o\u2019clock. My curfew is midnight. And, third of all, even if she doesn\u2019t want us here alone, she\u2019ll never know. She\u2019s at a movie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time will it be over?\u201d Luke asks.</p><p>\u201cTen thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019m leaving before ten thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say, grinning.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Luke says gently. He\u2019s standing over me now, finally calm, rolling up the sleeves of his untucked white dress shirt. The look of him makes my breath catch.</p> <p>I take a step forward so our faces are just inches away. Before I think too much about what I\u2019m doing, I stretch up on tiptoe, take Luke\u2019s face in my hands, and plant a firm kiss on his soft lips. He doesn\u2019t pull away; instead, he bends down slightly, low enough that I don\u2019t have to stay on my toes. He wraps his arms tightly around my waist, and I feel his strong palms press into my lower back. My hands move to the back of his neck. I lose track of time and place and just let go and enjoy the increasingly heated kisses.</p><p>My heart races, and the thought of shedding clothing comes to mind again. I lean into Luke, and, lip-locked, the two of us stumble backward, until his back thuds into the closed front door. I smash against his chest and it feels like warm marble. He moves his hands into my hair and I breathe heavier as I keep kissing, kissing, kissing him.</p><p>The five phones connected to the landline scream in unison and scare Luke and me apart as if we\u2019ve been caught by some chastity alarm. Realizing the source, and feeling silly both for being startled and for the hormone surge, I nervously laugh, and he joins in.</p><p>I take two steps backward, trip over my shoes, and fall to the floor, which sends me into hysterics. Unable to breathe, I roll into a ball of embarrassment, and Luke joins me on the floor, sitting at first, then lying and staring at the ceiling.</p><p>The phones finally stop ringing. I manage to compose myself.</p><p>\u201cI love your laugh,\u201d he says once I\u2019ve calmed down.</p><p>\u201cThanks, I love to laugh,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s one of my favorite things about you. Remember how spastic you were on our first date? It was cute.\u201d</p><p>Good to know, I think to myself.</p><p>\u201cTell me more,\u201d I say, as perfectly comfortable on the Persian rug as I\u2019d be lying on a couch or a bed. We are head to head, with our bodies at angles: if someone observed us from overhead, they\u2019d see a V.</p><p>\u201cMmmm, you want to know the reasons why I love you?\u201d he asks casually, as if he\u2019s said those words to me before. But if I\u2019m remembering my notes correctly, this is the first time.</p><p>My heart is threatening to break free from my chest, but I present a calm exterior. \u201cYes, a list, if you will.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a quiet chuckle.</p><p>\u201cThere are too many reasons to have a complete list, but I\u2019ll name a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, go on,\u201d I say, attempting to remain steady when I feel like bouncing. I hold my breath.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s the obvious. You\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, obviously,\u201d I reply flatly, masking the fact that my stomach just did cartwheels.</p><p>\u201cI love your hair. This sounds crazy, but when I first saw you in that ridiculous outfit with your long red hair flying out all over the place, I just wanted to touch it. It\u2019s soft, and it always smells good. In fact, hold on....\u201d Luke leans over and buries his nose in my hair. He takes a deep breath, then returns to his back.</p><p>\u201cAh, the best,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>\u201cYou are a total weirdo,\u201d I joke. He ignores me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see... what else? I love you because you\u2019re the type of person to befriend a new guy on his first day of school. Oh, and speaking of friends, I love that you haven\u2019t given up on Jamie, even though she\u2019s mad at you and not being very cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s worth it,\u201d I say in her defense.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I mean. You\u2019re not into cliques and all that crap. You\u2019re mature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. What did you say about laughing fits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, there are those. Most of the time, you\u2019re mature.\u201d Luke pokes me in the ribs and grins before facing the ceiling once again.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d I prompt him. \u201cThis is fun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d Luke says, folding his left forearm behind his head. He looks to the wall where his painting leans. \u201cI like that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s strange that I like to paint ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, a little. But I like strange,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, London,\u201d he says, rolling to his side to face me and propping his head on his hand. \u201cI think it\u2019s just the whole package. I can\u2019t pick you apart. I just love all of you. I think I always have.\u201d</p><p>I wonder what he means by \u201calways\u201d as he brushes my face with his hand and we are quiet for a moment. It doesn\u2019t sit quite right, but, not wanting to ruin the moment, I say, \u201cI love all of you, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The words are weighty, but I mean them, and I think Luke does, too. And, strangely, for their heaviness, I feel light. This feels easy.</p><p>We lie here, Luke and I, inhaling each other\u2019s breath and listening to the ticktock of the clock, when a very unpleasant gurgling growl erupts from the depths of me.</p><p>\u201cWas that your stomach?\u201d Luke asks, looking down at my abdomen.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I blurt out, before launching into a fresh wave of delirium. \u201cI... told... you... I... was... hungry!\u201d I manage to say between gasps for breath. He shakes his head at me and then slowly stands up. The sight of him towering above me in all his gorgeousness steals my giggles.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you a grilled cheese,\u201d he says, offering me his hands.</p><p>\u201cFinally!\u201d I say back, allowing him to pull me from the floor. Once I\u2019m standing, I shiver: the cold from the tile beneath the rug made it through me.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019m going to go grab a sweatshirt. You make yourself comfortable in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>I run up the stairs and search my bedroom for something fuzzy and warm. Nothing in plain view, I hit the closet light and start pulling folded items from the shelf. I evaluate my options and settle on a tan hoodie that I know from my notes is Luke\u2019s.</p> <p>Checking my reflection in the mirror, I decide to take the extra minute to pull my hair back into a ponytail. As I wrap the hair tie once, twice, then three times, my eyes scan the room, seeing it as Luke might.</p><p>If I let him come up here tonight.</p><p>The bed is beautifully made: Mom must have tidied up after we left for the dance. The throw pillows are lined up just so.</p><p>There is a photo of Luke and me in a dark wooden frame on the desk. I don\u2019t remember when it was taken.</p><p>In the corner, the hamper is empty.</p><p>On the nightstand are the lamp and an empty coaster where a used tea mug sat earlier. My mom really must have cleaned....</p> <p>Wait.</p><p>For a blink, I look back to the nightstand in the mirror. Then I turn around on the stool to see it firsthand.</p><p>It looks so... bare.</p><p>Because it is.</p><p>Because it is!</p><p>My pulse quickens as I quiz myself.</p><p>Where are my notes?</p><p>Did Mom move them? Did she put them away?</p> <p>No, she wouldn\u2019t do that. Or would she? I stand and rush across the room. I check the nightstand drawer and the desk drawers, too.</p><p>I chew my pointer fingernail, thinking. I turn slowly around the room, scanning every surface.</p><p>Did I take them somewhere?</p><p>Where would I take them?</p><p>Where did I have them last?</p><p>My breath sucks in almost before I fully realize what\u2019s happened.</p><p>I know where my notes are.</p><p>They\u2019re right where I left them.</p><p>Right where I was reading them before Luke picked me up tonight.</p><p>Right where I sent Luke to hang out.</p><p>They\u2019re in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I shout, running out of my bedroom and down the stairs, as if it will make any difference. \u201cLuke!\u201d I shout again in vain.</p><p>I know even before I\u2019m down the stairs that he\u2019s already seen them.</p><p>No answer comes from the direction of the kitchen. I quicken my pace and nearly slip on the polished hardwood while rounding the corner to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I say again, to his back. He faces the table and doesn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d I try a gazillionth time.</p><p>He turns, holding a single letter in his hands.</p><p>I stand, frozen, staring at him.</p><p>Finally, he speaks.</p><p>\u201cI wondered how you did it,\u201d he says.</p><p>Still frozen, I\u2019m confused.</p><p>\u201cDid what?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cHow you remembered me this time,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve caught you a few times, forgetting things. But most of the time, you seem... normal. You seem to recognize me each day.\u201d</p><p>My furrowed eyebrows rise as my eyes widen with the shocking confirmation that he knows.</p><p>Luke knows. For a moment, it\u2019s almost a relief. I don\u2019t have to work so hard. I don\u2019t have to...</p><p>Wait, Luke knows?</p><p>Then, I realize. For four months now, the boy before me has been lying to me.</p><p>He\u2019s as bad as my mother.</p><p>Is there anyone in my life who isn\u2019t deceiving me?</p><p>The relief is gone; the anger is here. My shoulders fall and my arms draw close, as if to protect myself from the world. Blood rushes to my face and my ears pound. My heart races.</p><p>I find it difficult to speak. But finally I\u2019m able.</p><p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d I ask, boiling.</p><p>\u201cYes, London, I knew,\u201d he says, smiling hesitantly, as if he doesn\u2019t know whether he should.</p><p>The smile sends me over the edge. My hands tighten into fists, and I feel the urge to scream at the top of my lungs.</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d I hiss, putting a hand on the counter to steady myself. I think of the cards from my father. The betrayal from my mother. And now this.</p><p>\u201cSince we were eleven,\u201d Luke says matter-of-factly, fueling the fire that\u2019s already raging in my veins.</p><p>\u201cLuke, what the hell are you talking about?\u201d I shout. I stare at him, feeling wronged. I want him to leave. But I want him to explain first.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he begins. \u201cDo you remember...\u201d He sweeps his hand over the pile of papers. \u201cDo you remember me mentioning that I spent a few summers with my aunt and uncle?\u201d</p><p>Glad that I took the time to study my notes today, I mutter, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you also remember that you went to day camp at the YMCA when you were younger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you did. And so did I. My aunt and uncle live here, London. Or at least my aunt does. They\u2019re going through a divorce. One of the reasons we moved here was so my mom could be closer to her sister.\u201d</p><p>I exhale loudly. I\u2019m still gripping the counter with one hand; the fingernails on the other are about to draw blood from my palm. Jaw clenched, I imagine myself biting through my own molars. Luke reads my body language and gets the hint.</p><p>\u201cAll that\u2019s beside the point,\u201d he says. \u201cThe point is that we went to the same camp for a summer. We were friends. You were my only friend. And I\u2019m pretty sure I was your only friend back then, too.\u201d</p><p>Luke pauses to make sure that the information is settling in. I stare sharply at him, and he takes my silence as a cue to go on.</p><p>\u201cNone of the other kids gave me the time of day, because I didn\u2019t live here. And of course, there was the dodgeball incident.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows slightly without speaking a word. I am livid, but also curious.</p><p>Luke shrugs like it was no big deal. \u201cWe were all playing dodgeball and one of the bigger kids purposely hurled the ball at my face when the counselor wasn\u2019t looking. My nose broke, but I have a high tolerance for pain, so I picked a fight with the kid and smiled as he pummeled me. I thought it would make me look cool. Instead, everyone thought I was a freak. Everyone except you.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at the compliment. I\u2019m not giving in that easily.</p><p>\u201cI noticed you the first day of camp. I watched you reading alone in the corner, keeping to yourself. I wanted to talk to you but I was chicken. And I seriously wanted to touch your hair back then, too. I wasn\u2019t kidding about that earlier.\u201d</p><p>Remembering our conversation on the rug, I experience a different kind of heat for an instant. Then I remember that, just like my mother, my boyfriend is a liar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I cross my arms over my chest, and Luke anxiously clears his throat. I think he knows he\u2019s about to get kicked out, so he races through the rest of the story.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, you came up to me after the fight and helped me. You gave me your sweater to stop the bleeding. It was totally ruined. I thought it was poetic or something to give you my sweatshirt that day outside the gym,\u201d he says as an aside, gesturing to the hoodie I\u2019m wearing. \u201cBut of course, you didn\u2019t get that,\u201d he adds.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it!\u201d I shout.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Luke says. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d He shifts and I check the clock. I hope with all my might that my mother doesn\u2019t come home and interrupt our conversation.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost ten,\u201d Luke says.</p><p>\u201cI can tell time,\u201d I fire back at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say harshly. \u201cBut finish first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, anyway, at camp, the day after the fight, I came up to you and said hello, and you didn\u2019t remember who I was. At first, I was hurt. I thought you were pretending not to know me. Like you were too cool or something. But you were nice, and chatty. So, I thought you had amnesia or something. I asked you if there was something wrong with your brain. You said, \u2018No, is there something wrong with yours?\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>One corner of Luke\u2019s mouth turns up a little as he remembers the exchange. He waits a beat, and then continues.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I kept asking in different ways, and finally you pulled me to a corner and told me that you had a big secret. That you remembered the future but not the past. You made me swear not to tell anyone, and I never did.\u201d</p><p>Luke pauses, and I stare at him silently. Realizing he\u2019s not getting props for secret keeping, he goes on.</p><p>\u201cSo, every day, we\u2019d meet each other again. We had a lot of the same conversations over and over. But we had a lot of new ones, too. Sometimes we\u2019d sit in the bottom of one of those climbing things that looked like Swiss cheese, and try to figure out who the kids were by the shoes they had on. It was really fun. You were good at that game.\u201d</p><p>I am taken aback by the realization that the \u201cfoot game\u201d I\u2019ll play forever came from my childhood relationship with Luke. I\u2019m curious about that, but I hold back. Anger is easier right now.</p><p>Luke\u2019s smiling wistfully, which makes me even madder. I roll my eyes and let out my breath, and he gets it. Nostalgia wiped clean from his face, he goes on. \u201cWhen I moved here I thought maybe you\u2019d remember me. But then, especially that night we fell asleep in the van... I knew for sure.\u201d</p> <p>There is a little tug on my heart when I hear the sadness in his voice. But I hold my ground.</p><p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon, I\u2019m really sorry for not telling you sooner,\u201d he says, taking two slow steps toward me, like he\u2019s approaching a wild animal.</p><p>Instinctively, I edge backward, away from the guy I couldn\u2019t get close enough to minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re sorry for lying,\u201d I say harshly. \u201cFor betraying me. For taking advantage of my situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little extreme,\u201d Luke says with a small laugh. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve pretty much been lying to me, if you think about it.\u201d He almost smirks now, which sends me into a tailspin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same!\u201d I shout at him. \u201cYou have no idea how it feels to completely forget every single day. I wake up not knowing what I wore to school the day before, let alone what stupid things I may have said or done. I remember things that no one\u2014no one\u2014should have to anticipate experiencing. Horrible things. Things that are going to happen to me...\u201d</p><p>Tears are streaming down my face now. Luke takes another step toward me and I put up a hand to stop him. I keep ranting through the sobs.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got enough going on, and now this. My best friend has gone off the deep end. My mom is lying to me, and apparently you\u2019ve been lying, too.\u201d</p><p>Something hits me and I interrupt myself.</p><p>\u201cWait, if I knew you, why didn\u2019t my mom tell me that when she met you again? Or was that just another one of her lies? Were you in this together?\u201d</p><p>Luke looks down and away. His cheeks flush.</p><p>\u201cI never met her in person, and she wouldn\u2019t know my name because I went by something else back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, curious despite my anger.</p><p>\u201cL.J.\u201d Luke says sheepishly. \u201cI thought I was tough, and that all tough guys went by their initials.\u201d He takes another step.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I command, finding no amusement in Luke\u2019s childish confession. \u201cWhatever your name is or was, the point is that you lied. You could have pieced together some of my past for me. You could have actually helped me, Luke. Can\u2019t you see that? But you didn\u2019t. You willingly deceived me. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do that to me. To someone you supposedly love. To someone who thought she loved you.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s face falls and he\u2019s silent for a few seconds. Then he brushes away two tears that escape his blue eyes. He looks helpless, and part of me wants to hug him.</p><p>Instead, when I can control myself enough to speak again, I say, almost choking, \u201cJust go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon, I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t think it would upset you this much. I wasn\u2019t trying to...\u201d His voice fades and his head hangs for a moment. Then he looks up at me and our eyes hold steady. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want you to have to feel self-conscious around me.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and back out of the kitchen doorway so that he can leave. His shoulders are slumped as he walks by me on the way to the foyer.</p><p>From the kitchen, I hear him put on his shoes and then open and quietly close the front door behind him. I hear the van start and rev; when its gentle hum fades into the night, I crumble to the kitchen floor.</p><p>Despite it being after midnight, my hushed ringtone sounds from beneath the pillow for the third time in an hour. There are voice mails waiting to be deleted once I can touch my phone without accidentally answering his call.</p><p>It\u2019s amazing how much stuff one can accumulate after dating someone only four months. A mini-mountain of notes and photos are piled high in the fancy hatbox from my closet. The hatbox is meant for mementos. Instead, it will be a time capsule never intended to see the light of day.</p><p>Girls the world over will be envious of my ability to dole out the perfect heaping of revenge to the boy who wronged me. Done crying now, I summon the ability that I and I alone seem to possess, and channel what surely would be Jamie\u2019s sound advice were she here to give it.</p><p>\u201cForget him,\u201d she\u2019d say.</p><p>\u201cGood plan,\u201d I say aloud.</p><p>Sweeping away the sweetness and focusing on the bad, I smash the hatbox pile to make room for the last few items. Before closing the lid, I add the note scratched in barely dry ink, explaining what he did to deserve this fate should I uncover the box in the future.</p><p>The note for my mom is on the kitchen table: the one that summarizes the breakup and instructs her never to speak of Luke again.</p><p>The job is almost complete.</p><p>I delete the voice mails without listening to them and erase his number from my cell. When I\u2019m positive that my mom is out cold, I sneak to the basement to hide my failed relationship among old kitchen appliances, boxes of notes from years gone by, and worn toys littering the junk closet beneath the stairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t linger to consider the ramifications of erasing Luke from my thoughts. Instead, I switch off the basement lights, hurry back up the stairs, and scoot deep beneath the covers. I think of Luke until I fall asleep.</p><p>Sleep comes too quickly tonight.</p><p>28</p><p>A hand grips my left elbow just as I\u2019m getting ready to retrieve my Anatomy book from the depths of my locker. The note said I didn\u2019t finish my homework this weekend, so I need to do it in study hall.</p> <p>I wince at the elbow grip, not because it\u2019s rough but because my arm still hurts from when I managed to fall on it during first-period PE, playing volleyball, of all things. You don\u2019t even move that much in volleyball, yet I dislodged a tiny piece of elbow bone. At least that\u2019s what it feels like. It\u2019s probably just another bruise.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d I say, spinning to face the grabber. I don\u2019t know who I was expecting, but surely it wasn\u2019t him.</p><p>The gorgeous boy drops his grip on my arm and recoils like he\u2019s been burned. In his perfect blue eyes, I see confusion, anger, hurt, and even a touch of pleading. I don\u2019t recognize him, but I wish I did.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you,\u201d he says softly. His voice is smooth and oddly relaxing.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s not your fault,\u201d I say, rubbing my elbow. \u201cI fell on it in gym class. I\u2019m a bit of a klutz.\u201d</p> <p>The boy smiles a sad smile then, and a hint of a dimple appears on his right cheek. My stomach flips over, and suddenly I\u2019m very aware of myself. I shift awkwardly from one foot to the other.</p><p>Realizing that I\u2019m staring, I break my gaze and turn back to my locker to get the book I was after in the first place.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you with something?\u201d I ask, still facing the locker in an effort to appear nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d the boy says quietly.</p><p>I stuff the book, a notepad, and a spare pen from the top shelf into the oversized gray and white striped shoulder bag I found in the hall closet this morning, and slam the locker door shut. The hall is crowded now, and the girl with the locker next to mine exhales loudly as she tries to get to her own belongings. The boy is blocking her way.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d he says to her when he realizes his blunder.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d She shoves her way past him.</p><p>The boy has moved to block my way now, and I begin to rethink my desire to remember him. There\u2019s a slightly creepy sense of urgency about him.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask, wondering whether there\u2019s something wrong with him. Is this kid going to freak out on me? Is that why I don\u2019t remember him?</p><p>Gripping my bag like a security blanket, I take a step to the right to try to move around him, but he anticipates my move and blocks me again. He bends slightly and looks directly into my eyes before speaking.</p><p>\u201cNo, London, I\u2019m not okay. We have one fight and that\u2019s it? You won\u2019t return my calls. You weren\u2019t home yesterday when I came by. We need to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>When he finishes, he straightens slightly but doesn\u2019t stop with the eye contact. I don\u2019t know what to do, so I opt for honesty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I don\u2019t even know you.\u201d I smile weakly as if to console a friend.</p><p>It\u2019s like a lightbulb turns on in the boy\u2019s head. He stands completely straight and his eyes narrow. He shakes his head and then looks at me with even more venom.</p> <p>\u201cReal mature, London. Thanks a lot,\u201d the boy hisses. He turns and strides down the main hall in the direction I need to go.</p><p>The girl with the locker next to mine giggles as she passes; she\u2019s heard the whole conversation. \u201cI\u2019ll take him if you don\u2019t want him.\u201d</p><p>I wait until there\u2019s no sign of the boy before I weave my way to study hall. As I move, I review what happened and end up just as confused. I open the massive library doors and walk through the metal detectors, happy to have one whole class period to ponder the situation.</p><p>And, oh yeah, do my Anatomy homework.</p><p>But then, as I approach the bank of tables reserved for study hall, I realize my bad fortune.</p><p>The brooding boy sits alone at the only table with any free seats.</p><p>Of course he does.</p><p>Surprisingly, the gorgeous freak is otherwise engaged all period long, so I manage to finish my homework with time to spare. Even so, I can\u2019t help but notice the huffs and snorts coming from the boy as he writes furiously in his notebook. Angry much?</p><p>Now, as I sit packed and ready to leave the moment the bell rings in forty-four... forty-three... forty-two seconds, the boy is still writing. I can\u2019t help but watch the muscles on his toned left forearm flex as he moves the pen across the page. His worn T-shirt looks baby-soft and hangs perfectly across his shoulders and chest. I find myself wanting to touch the waved lock of hair that peeks out from behind his right ear....</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the boy snaps as he looks right at me. Several other clock-watching students turn in our direction.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I whisper, looking back to the industrial wall-mounted clock that tells me I\u2019ll be free from this uncomfortable situation in twenty... nineteen... eighteen... seconds.</p><p>I hear the boy rip the pages he\u2019s been working on from his notebook, which strikes me as odd, since I\u2019d think he\u2019d want to keep them safe until class.</p><p>Finally, the bell rings, and I stand so quickly to leave that I practically knock my chair back.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he says in a softer tone. Instead of running, I turn to face him.</p><p>\u201cPlease read this,\u201d he says, offering me what I realize now is a letter. It\u2019s folded in half, with my name written on the outside.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say as he brushes past me, leaving me confused and alone in a barren library with a warm and oddly familiar scent lingering behind him.</p><p>I skip the trip to my locker before math, opting instead to arrive early and see what on earth this boy could be so mad at me about.</p><p>Minutes later, I realize that being early was a good choice.</p><p>Dear London,</p><p>First off, let me just say that I love you. Keep that in mind as you read on....</p><p>My name is Luke Henry and I\u2019ve been your boyfriend since I started at Meridan in October. You don\u2019t remember me in your future for some reason we haven\u2019t sorted out yet, but I\u2019d like the chance to find out why.</p><p>You\u2019re really mad at me right now, and rightly so. I never told you that we\u2019d met, but we had. When we were younger, we went to camp together. I was fascinated by you and how, every day, you\u2019d befriend me again even though you didn\u2019t remember me from the day before. You were my first real crush, and now you\u2019re my first real love.</p><p>After the Winter Formal on Saturday night, I found the notes that you used to remember me and I told you the truth. You were right when you said that I\u2019d been lying to you for all this time. I\u2019m so sorry, London, and all I want is the chance to redeem myself. I have no idea why I did it. Maybe I thought you\u2019d think I was a stalker. Maybe I just wanted to see if you\u2019d ever wake up and know who I was.</p><p>You didn\u2019t.</p><p>But, London, we\u2019re good together. I don\u2019t want to lose you. I made a huge mistake, but I hope that you can consider forgiving me. Because like I said in the beginning, I love you, London Lane.</p><p>Always.</p><p>Luke </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>* *</p><p>After school, a floral hatbox sits before me with its innards exposed. Luke\u2019s apology letter in one hand and a photo of a happy couple in the other, I feel like my innards are exposed, too.</p><p>My mom didn\u2019t seem surprised when I asked her about him. She led me right to the hatbox, with a look that bordered on patronizing.</p><p>\u201cWell, that didn\u2019t take long,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet,\u201d I replied, grabbing the hatbox and taking refuge in my room.</p><p>Now, in a word, I\u2019m thrown.</p><p>I started at the beginning, and after reading about the first few times Luke and I spoke, I was ready to dial his number and accept his apology right then and there.</p><p>But then I read on, with his betrayal in mind. Every seemingly pleasant moment filtered through this new lens of lies became darker\u2014dirtier. He was keeping a secret from me the whole time, never letting me know the real Luke.</p><p>Then again, I was keeping a secret from him, too.</p> <p>In a way, we were both at fault.</p><p>Still, his lie was worse.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>My cell phone rings beside me and I know that it\u2019s him, even though the number isn\u2019t stored in my phone. I consider ignoring the call, but can\u2019t help but answer.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d A smooth voice breathes into the phone, sending chills down my spine. Why did he lie? If I wasn\u2019t mad at him, I could be staring into his blue eyes right now.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say back.</p><p>\u201cI know you said that you needed time, but I had to call,\u201d Luke begins.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not exactly giving me space,\u201d I say, determined not to be charmed so easily. Gorgeous or not, he hurt me.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says softly, sounding helpless. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do anything,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cI said I needed space to figure this out, and if you really care about me, you\u2019ll respect that.\u201d</p><p>I wince and think he might have, too, although I can\u2019t be sure. He\u2019s silent for a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cOkay, London,\u201d he says finally, with a sadness that breaks my heart a little. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>Instead of telling him \u201cnever mind,\u201d like I desperately want to, I simply say, \u201cThank you, Luke,\u201d and disconnect before I make any promises I might not be able to keep.</p> <p>Leaning against my bed with the gutted hatbox before me and chronicles of our relationship littering the floor, I can\u2019t help but cry. I don\u2019t want to be sensible. I don\u2019t want to think about things. I don\u2019t want to have to forgive him.</p><p>I don\u2019t want him to have lied in the first place.</p><p>I shove the debris off my legs and climb up onto my bed, lying facedown in my pillow and sobbing for who knows how long. I don\u2019t hear her come in but my mom appears, smoothing my hair and patting my back and telling me it\u2019ll all be okay.</p><p>No, it won\u2019t, I think to myself.</p><p>It won\u2019t be okay at all.</p><p>29</p><p>Life blindsided me this morning.</p><p>It\u2019s barely past seven o\u2019clock on a Wednesday, and already I\u2019m tired. It seems everything is wrong, so I focus on something small.</p><p>Page Thomas.</p><p>Yesterday\u2019s note says that she served as a captain in gym class. When I was the last person on the bench, Page told Ms. Martinez and the class that she\u2019d rather play one person short than have me on her team.</p><p>Nice.</p><p>I moved on to reading about Luke, but then something in a note from four months ago caught my attention. It was around the time Luke moved to town:</p><p>Bring yoga pants, T-shirt for gym (had to borrow clothes from Page Fri.)</p><p>Yesterday, Page wouldn\u2019t have lent me a square of toilet paper, let alone a shirt. I remember her tomorrow and there\u2019s no way she\u2019d lend me anything then, either. Curious, I spend the next hour searching through notes for entries about her. And what I realize is this:</p><p>I saved Page Thomas.</p><p>Okay, sure, it wasn\u2019t from a forty-story building sent up in flames or anything. But, looking back now, I see clearly there was a time when I remembered Brad breaking Page\u2019s heart. Demolishing it, actually.</p><p>But this morning, when I think of Page and Brad, I remember them together until I can\u2019t remember them at all. I\u2019ll hear at the senior party that they\u2019re going to college together; that\u2019s the last they\u2019ll be in my life.</p><p>As far as I can tell from notes, things changed when I lied about Brad not liking girls. Page was forced to find another way into Brad\u2019s arms, and it seems to have made all the difference.</p><p>So, yes, I am friendless. And, yes, I\u2019ve been wronged by an apparently gorgeous and wonderful guy. I\u2019m living with a mom I can\u2019t trust and dreading the worst kind of heartbreak imaginable in the form of a dead child.</p><p>My life is screwed up, to say the least.</p><p>But the tiny smidgen of a tidbit of a crumb of a shaving of sunshine on this bleak Wednesday morning is that I saved Page Thomas from heartbreak. With one simple decision months ago, I changed something for the better.</p><p>And if I can help her, surely I can help myself.</p><p>I have the metal door positioned in a way that allows me to keep watch on Jamie Connor\u2019s locker across the hall without being obvious about it. I\u2019m staring into the magnetic vanity mirror, waiting. Of course, I look like I\u2019m in love with myself, but no one is paying attention to me anyway.</p><p>Because I can see what\u2019s behind me, I know that the boy I\u2019m assuming is Luke, thanks to photos in my bedroom this morning, walked by earlier, slowly, hesitantly, like he wanted to stop.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He\u2019s waiting; that\u2019s good.</p><p>Finally, a familiar blunt blonde haircut catches my eye, and I turn to confirm that Jamie has arrived. She\u2019s in too-tight faded jeans and a hot-pink top that seems innocent enough from the back but which I know, without having to look, is low-cut in the front.</p><p>I slam the metal door so that the lock catches securely and ease my way across two lanes of students, eyes on Jamie\u2019s back the whole time. Once I reach her, I have to clear my throat before she notices me standing at her side.</p><p>\u201cHi, J,\u201d I say brightly.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she mutters, turning back to her locker.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cDo you care?\u201d she says, not turning around.</p><p>\u201cOf course I care, Jamie, you\u2019re my best friend!\u201d She glances at me, then back to the locker.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d she says. \u201cOr am I too much of a slut to be your friend anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie, that\u2019s not fair!\u201d I say. Jamie slams her locker door and turns to face me. Her eyes are cold, vacant.</p><p>\u201cNo, London. No, it isn\u2019t,\u201d she says bitterly, before walking off toward her first class.</p><p>My face flushes, and I\u2019m so mad that I want to chase after her and shake her and tell her everything I know that she doesn\u2019t. But just then, the bell signaling the start of the period rings, and chasing down Jamie might mean detention with her boyfriend, I mean Mr. Rice. So instead, I rush to the library.</p><p>Ms. Mason glares at me for being late, and Luke sits up expectantly when I fall into the chair opposite him, but something about my body language tells them both to back off. I work on Spanish homework the whole period and leave quickly when the bell sounds. I can feel Luke\u2019s disappointment, and guilt creeps through me until I remember this morning\u2019s notes. This is the guy who lied to me for four months. Four months. He deserves a little indecision. He deserves to sweat it out a bit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Skipping the trip to my locker, I settle into my seat in Spanish and watch the door.

Jamie had the last word, and it was a nasty one. My anger subsides because it has to, and it\u2019s replaced by sadness. I can\u2019t help but feel that my best friend has abandoned me.</p><p>And I get it, at least a little. I know she\u2019s upset. I know she\u2019s jealous of Luke. I know she wishes I didn\u2019t disapprove of her boyfriend, if you want to call Mr. Rice that.</p> <p>But getting it doesn\u2019t make it stop hurting.</p><p>Forever, I will share my thoughts and feelings with Jamie. Forever, except for right now. And right now, I really need her.</p><p>She should be here to exchange notes about whether or not to forgive Luke. She should be here to whisper with me about my dad. She should calm me\u2014just by being nearby\u2014about things too awful to know. She should willingly partner with me for stupid pronunciation drills.</p><p>But I\u2019m alone, not just for pronunciation drills. For everything. Every morning when I wake up and learn this anew, a fresh wound will open\u2014until the day Jamie decides to forgive me.</p><p>And then we\u2019ll be fine again.</p> <p>Because that\u2019s how I remember it.</p><p>30</p><p>The house line rings twice before my mom answers it. I can hear her muffled voice from the kitchen below my bedroom. A minute later, there\u2019s a quick knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cLondon, are you up?\u201d she whispers through the door.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mom, I\u2019m awake. Come on in,\u201d I say from my seat at the desk. I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t hear me moving around earlier. I\u2019ve been up for hours.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a woman on the phone for you,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWeird,\u201d I say before pushing back in my desk chair and walking to the telephone table in the hallway. I pick up the receiver and wait until my mom makes her way down to the kitchen and hangs up the other extension.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, this is London. Who\u2019s this?\u201d I say, twirling the phone cord around my index finger.</p><p>\u201cThis is Abby Brennan. We met a few months ago?\u201d</p><p>My mind is blank. I\u2019m silent.</p><p>\u201cYou came to my house? You were looking for your grandmother, Jo Lane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d I lie into the phone. I have no clue. This was not in my notes. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you,\u201d the woman says kindly. I can hear a child\u2019s voice in the background, singing a song about snakes on parade. \u201cChelsea, Mommy\u2019s on the phone, honey. Sorry about that, London.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t hear the little girl\u2019s response, but I don\u2019t hear the snake song anymore, either.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m calling because I remembered the name of your grandmother\u2019s retirement home in the city. It\u2019s been driving me crazy for months, and finally this week it came to me.\u201d</p><p>My stomach tightens into knots. I\u2019ve been reading notes all morning; how did I miss this?</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I say to the woman, hoping to sound casual.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s called Lingering Pines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d I say robotically, even as my mind spins out of control.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I just wanted to let you know. When you speak to her, please tell Jo that the house is being well taken care of. Give her our best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I say mindlessly before telling the woman good-bye and hanging up the phone.</p><p>In the remaining forty-five minutes before school, I carefully dress, apply makeup, and flat-iron my hair, all the while pondering what just happened.</p><p>Somehow, I clearly managed to figure out that my grandmother\u2019s name is Jo Lane. Then, apparently I went to Abby Brennan\u2019s house looking for said grandmother. And now, I guess that my grandmother, Jo Lane, is in a nursing home.</p><p>Called Lingering Pines.</p><p>In the city.</p><p>What I don\u2019t get is, why? Why wouldn\u2019t I chronicle all of this for myself?</p><p>All I can fathom as I apply a top layer of lip gloss is that when I researched my grandmother, I felt that I\u2019d come up empty. All I can rationalize is that I didn\u2019t want to torture myself with knowing that I failed. All I can figure is that I gave up.</p><p>But now I have the name of my grandmother\u2019s nursing home. I can contact her, if I want to. And she might lead me to my father.</p><p>Looking in the mirror, I smile at my reflection. I feel powerful with this new information, with my stick-straight hair; long, dark lashes; and fitted black button-down.</p><p>And feeling powerful is a good thing, because apparently there\u2019s a boy in my life who needs to be reminded to never, ever wrong me again.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans for tonight?\u201d my mom asks hours later at dinner.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, avoiding direct eye contact. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll watch a movie.\u201d</p><p>Really, I can\u2019t wait to Google Lingering Pines and call to confirm that my grandmother is a resident. After that, who knows?</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be too late,\u201d Mom says. \u201cIt\u2019s only two houses.\u201d</p><p>I shrug; she can stay out all night for all I care.</p><p>\u201cI bought some popcorn,\u201d Mom offers, trying a little too hard.</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks,\u201d I say, scooping up the last of my peas and wishing she\u2019d leave already, or at least stop watching me eat. I give her a broad, cheesy (fake) smile that, thankfully, she buys. Mom walks across the room, kisses the top of my head, and grabs her keys.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019d better get going, then. Have a good night, sweetie. Let\u2019s do something fun tomorrow, just us girls, okay?\u201d She pauses by the door to the garage, waiting.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mom,\u201d I say reassuringly so she\u2019ll leave. Seconds later, it works.</p><p>Hastily, I rinse my plate and put it in the dishwasher before skipping up the stairs and waking up my computer from sleep mode. In less than a minute, not only do I have the number for Lingering Pines, but I\u2019m halfway through the photo gallery of images of its sweeping grounds, happy residents, and well-maintained facilities. Though I assume that the people in the pictures are models, I carefully inspect each photo just in case, then print the main page and some of the photos for reminders.</p><p>I have the jitters as I ponder what I\u2019m about to do. Step one: find Grandma. Step two: find Dad.</p><p>Before I have the chance to talk myself out of it, I open my cell phone and dial the main number for Lingering Pines. The tone sounds long and lonely. I picture a dated phone waiting unattended, its shrill call going unnoticed over too-loud TVs shouting from the patients\u2019 rooms.</p><p>I wish for a receptionist to pick up the second before she does. Except that it\u2019s a recording telling me that Lingering Pines is closed, and to please call again tomorrow or dial one for the nurse\u2019s station.</p><p>Apparently the elderly residents of Lingering Pines Retirement Community are only open for business between the hours of 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM daily.</p><p>Feeling that this isn\u2019t earth-shattering enough to disturb a nurse, I hang up. I store the number in my contacts, allowing myself to imagine for a moment what it would be like to have a grandmother to call and visit sometimes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Later, long after I\u2019ve left high school behind, I will envy my friend Margaret\u2019s relationship with her grandmother. I will cry when she dies of cancer, not because I\u2019ll know her that well but because I\u2019ll see Margaret lose a little piece of herself when the sweet old woman goes.</p><p>Nothing left to do on my grandmother search this evening, I turn off the computer, wash the day from my face, and head downstairs to make popcorn and watch a movie, just like I told my mom I would.</p><p>In the kitchen, I get out the kernels and the mini-kettle. I scan the directions on the popcorn container, then add the oil and kernels to the pan, turn on the stove, and start slowly turning the crank. The first kernel explodes, then the second, then twelve or twenty or fifty more. Concentrating on nothing but the span of time between the tiny explosions so as not to burn my precious popcorn, I barely notice the sound from the front entryway. In fact, by the time I pause to listen, I wonder whether I heard anything at all.</p><p>Then it\u2019s there again: a timid knock at the front door.</p> <p>Not the doorbell.</p><p>A knock.</p><p>Still holding the handle of the popcorn pan, I glance at the clock. It only feels like midnight. Really, it\u2019s 6:58, a perfectly appropriate time for accepting visitors on a Friday night. If only I were expecting visitors.</p><p>Immediately, I wonder if today\u2019s outfit worked; I wonder if it\u2019s Luke. I find myself hoping that it is, even though I\u2019m still hurt by his actions.</p><p>I set the popcorn aside and hurry from the kitchen. I switch on the porch light and wish our door had a peephole.</p> <p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d I call.</p><p>There is a pause, and I consider backing away from the door and calling my mom to come home. Maybe it\u2019s not him. Finally:</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Luke.\u201d</p><p>I suck in my breath. Then I wait a beat and open the door.</p><p>The waves of Luke\u2019s hair are rustling in the winter wind and his cheeks are flushed from the cold. He briefly removes one hand from his jeans pocket to wave hello without speaking the word itself, and then replaces his hand. He looks boyish and a touch embarrassed to be here, shuffling his feet as I open the door wider.</p><p>I wrap my arms around my torso to shield myself from the frigid outdoors, but it doesn\u2019t really help. I\u2019m freezing, but I don\u2019t mind.</p> <p>Luke is here.</p><p>He looks around, and then suddenly his blue eyes are on mine, invading my space and my soul. I feel self-conscious from his piercing stare, but no part of me wants to break free from it, either.</p><p>\u201cIs your mom here?\u201d Luke asks, in a tone both soft and strong. Feeling weak, I tighten the grip on my torso for support.</p><p>\u201cNo, she went...\u201d</p><p>Before I can finish my sentence, Luke is up the entryway step, kissing me.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>His palms are on either side of my face, and the few feet that were between us have shrunk to inches. One inch, maybe.</p><p>I drop my arms in surrender, then slowly wind them around this boy before me, tight and then tighter still. Luke kicks shut the front door behind him, lips still locked on mine, and we kiss each other like one of us is dying.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay away from you,\u201d he whispers when he finally takes a break to breathe. He\u2019s staring directly into my eyes with his forehead pressed against mine, and his hands are still holding tight to my face, as if to keep me there and ensure that I look at him right back.</p><p>To ensure that I see him. And, boy, do I.</p><p>His eyes look pained yet determined. I can see in them that he\u2019s not letting go, and I know for sure now that I don\u2019t want him to, either.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stay away from me, then,\u201d I whisper back, placing my hands gently over his and lowering them to my neck and then my sides. The movement relaxes him a little, and I can tell that his angst is waning.</p><p>\u201cDo you forgive me, London?\u201d Luke asks, his eyes still cutting into me.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d I say truthfully.</p><p>Yes, he lied to me. But he loves me, and I love him, and people make mistakes. I can\u2019t see him in my future to know for sure, but I believe he\u2019ll learn from this. He seems to be that type of person.</p><p>Luke is kissing me again now, softer this time. I try to think of nothing and just enjoy the moment, but I can\u2019t help but wonder when my mom will return.</p><p>The house shifts, and I jump away from Luke like we\u2019ve been caught.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, looking around.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say, peeking behind me just to make sure. \u201cI just thought my mom was back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say, so forcefully that he laughs. \u201cNo,\u201d I say again softer, this time moving two steps toward him and taking his right hand in mine. \u201cStay for a little while.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m embarrassed and excited at the same time, and there must have been a suggestive edge to my words, because now Luke blushes a little.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go upstairs?\u201d he asks, squeezing my hand tighter.</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d he asks, bending a little to look curiously into my face.</p><p>At a loss for a gentler response, I just come out with it.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re not doing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what? You mean that? Sex?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s still staring right at me as he says it, and now I\u2019m the one turning red and feeling childish for even mentioning it.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think we were going to,\u201d he says, eyes holding steady. How is he so cool right now? Has he had this conversation a million times before? I\u2019m about to respond when he interrupts me by adding, \u201cAt least not tonight.\u201d</p><p>My stomach flutters.</p><p>\u201cGood, glad we\u2019re clear on that,\u201d I say, turning to head up to my room, still holding his hand.</p><p>Behind me, Luke says, \u201cI did tell my parents that I\u2019m spending the night at Adam\u2019s tonight.\u201d</p><p>Halfway up the stairs, I halt, and turn to face him.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, looking a little devious.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you planning to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the van.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d be out for the night. You and Jamie could have made up or something; you could have gone to her house. I thought I might need to stalk you a little harder,\u201d he says with a laugh.</p><p>A slow smile creeps across my face. The gesture is sweet: Luke risked getting in trouble with his parents and spending all night in his van just to try to win me back.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure my mom won\u2019t be home for a while. At least you can stay in the warm house until she comes back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Luke says as I turn and finish the climb, pulling my delinquent boyfriend behind me to the top of the stairs, down the hallway, and into my bedroom, and shutting the door behind us.</p><p>31</p><p>\u201cWhere did you park?\u201d I whisper with a sudden sense of urgency as I listen to the garage door open and close downstairs.</p><p>\u201cDown the street; I was stalking you, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the closet,\u201d I whisper back, making a snap decision that I hope I won\u2019t regret later.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious? I can just go,\u201d he offers, but he\u2019s moving toward the closet as he speaks.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to stay. But hurry up; my mom will be upstairs in a minute,\u201d I say, simultaneously kicking a massive pile of notes under the bed and scanning the bedroom for any visible traces of boy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hear the sink running in the kitchen; she must be getting a glass of water. Glancing at the clock, I wonder whether my mom will think it\u2019s weird if I\u2019m asleep just after nine. Maybe. But I have no other way to get rid of her quickly, so I bolt across the room and throw myself under the covers. I try to breathe easier and look peaceful, even though my heart is racing.</p><p>Mom\u2019s footsteps are growing louder, and with only seconds left, I whisper a barely audible \u201cshhh\u201d to Luke.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe there\u2019s a boy in my closet right now! What am I thinking?</p><p>No time to ponder my stupidity. The door opens slowly and I freeze. I\u2019m facing the wall, but I keep my eyes closed anyway, just in case she rushes over to check whether I\u2019m faking.</p> <p>Highly unlikely.</p><p>\u201cNight, London, I love you.\u201d My mom\u2019s whispered words float through the night air so softly that they\u2019re barely there. Is this her nightly ritual? I can\u2019t help but feel a pang of guilt at the deceit that\u2019s happening under her nose.</p><p>Then again, she\u2019s been deceiving me for years.</p><p>After the door quietly taps the frame and I hear my mom slowly release the handle; after her footsteps disappear into her own room; after the water rushes to wash toothpaste and face soap down the drain; after the TV in her room sounds; after that, I wait five more excruciatingly long minutes.</p><p>And then I tiptoe to the closet.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d I whisper to Luke. It\u2019s pitch-black. I can\u2019t see anything.</p><p>From the back corner of the closet comes his smooth voice.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>I hear him climb to his feet and watch his perfect self materialize from the darkness.</p><p>Instead of stopping, Luke walks until his warm body is pressing against mine in the closet doorway.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says again, even smoother this time, if that\u2019s possible, before planting a long and borderline inappropriate kiss on my lips.</p> <p>Perhaps we\u2019re both charged by the exhilaration of being bad, or maybe it\u2019s the pitch-blackness that drives us, but soon enough we\u2019re on the floor of my walk-in and a few articles of clothing aren\u2019t exactly where they should be.</p><p>I stick to my earlier promise of not doing... that. But for at least an hour, maybe more, Luke makes it very, very difficult.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to sleep,\u201d I say when my breathing has finally slowed to the point that I can speak. I\u2019m lying on Luke\u2019s bare chest, which is strangely comfortable, considering it\u2019s hard as a rock.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says softly, leaning down to kiss the top of my head before beginning to untangle his longer limbs from mine.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my shirt?\u201d I ask, surprisingly at ease being literally and emotionally exposed to him.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d he says, tossing it my way.</p><p>Once we\u2019re both dressed, Luke in what he wore this evening and me in pajamas, we walk toward my bed.</p><p>\u201cSleep here with me, okay?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll take the floor in the closet,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cjust in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she won\u2019t come in,\u201d I promise, without really knowing whether we\u2019ll be caught.</p><p>\u201cHow about this: I\u2019ll lie here until you fall asleep, then I\u2019ll go in the closet so she doesn\u2019t find me in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Too tired to argue, and anxious to be out before my memory resets at 4:33, I climb back in bed. This time, I scoot close to the wall and leave half the bed for Luke. He joins me under the covers and immediately we\u2019re snapped together like Legos.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to write a note. I need to write this down or I\u2019ll forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please do,\u201d Luke says. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to freak out again and make me explain things to your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d I say, elbowing him. He laughs quietly and I do, too, remembering the note from the day after our first date. Luke read that note and many of the others earlier tonight.</p><p>\u201cHmm, just a sec,\u201d Luke says, reaching his outside arm toward the nightstand and retrieving my cell phone. He frees his other arm from under me, quickly types a message, and hits send. Immediately, my phone buzzes to alert me that I have a new text.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d I ask after Luke sets the phone back next to the bed.</p><p>\u201cThe boy in the closet is your boyfriend. He loves you and will tell you all about last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute,\u201d I say, feeling my eyelids droop and sleep approach. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to tell me about the last hour in the closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll re-create it for you tomorrow,\u201d Luke says, pulling me closer and breathing in my hair. \u201cI really do, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d I ask in a sleepy haze.</p><p>\u201cI really do love you, London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Luke.\u201d</p><p>32</p><p>The text said there was a boy in my closet, but all I found is this note.</p><p>Dear London,</p><p>You snore.</p><p>I heard your mom leave, so I escaped. I\u2019ll come back in a while with coffee and officially announce my presence. If she comes back, you might want to tell her I\u2019m coming so she knows we\u2019re okay.</p><p>Read up... all of your notes are under your bed.</p><p>You were too tired to write a note last night but here are the highlights (I\u2019ll fill in the holes later):</p><p>\u2014I begged your forgiveness (you\u2019ll read about why)</p><p>\u2014Thankfully, you forgave me</p><p>\u2014We spent hours reading your notes\u2014 you said that was a great way for me to get to know the real you</p><p>\u2014As previously mentioned, you snore... and talk in your sleep</p><p>\u2014I promised to reenact certain... other things</p><p>Last night was amazing. I wish you could remember it, but I\u2019ll do my best to remind you. Oh, and PS\u2014you are the best kisser ever.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Luke</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we happy this morning?\u201d my mom says when she returns from the grocery store and sees my permagrin. I stuff a bite of a bagel into my mouth, but it doesn\u2019t help, so I just shrug in response.</p><p>\u201cDare I ask?\u201d she says, which is really asking, isn\u2019t it? Mom pours herself some coffee and leans against the counter, gazing at me, mug in hand.</p><p>\u201cLuke and I made up,\u201d I say matter-of-factly, once I\u2019ve swallowed the biggest bite imaginable.</p><p>\u201cAhh, I see,\u201d she says with a knowing look.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming over this morning,\u201d I add, gesturing to my outfit as if it needed explanation. Every Saturday I can remember is spent in pajamas, until noon at least. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hang out today.\u201d</p><p>I think I see a touch of hurt flash across my mother\u2019s eyes, but in an instant, it\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, London,\u201d she says, pushing off the countertop and topping off her cup. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go into the office and catch up on some work, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I say, thrilled that Luke and I might be alone in the house for a while. The notes I read painted a picture of a boy so appealing that I find myself wanting to be unsupervised. Except, of course, that he lied to me, but his note said we made up. I\u2019ll count on him to walk me through the evening minute by minute.</p><p>As if on cue, the doorbell rings, and I practically run to the entryway to answer it. Flinging it open, I nearly gasp at the boy standing there in the bright sun. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sure, there were photos, but they didn\u2019t do him justice.</p><p>Luke is holding two to-go cups of coffee, but instead of coming in, he stands on the porch.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Quickly, I run and tell Mom that we\u2019re going to the mall\u2014hey, it could be true\u2014then grab my jacket, cell, and wallet.

He hears my footsteps and turns to face me, eyes bright and beautiful.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I say, bounding out of the house and taking the coffee from his outstretched hand. He kisses me lightly on the cheek and whispers, \u201cDid you get my note?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, and it comes out more intimate than I meant, but it feels just fine.</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says, in a way that makes me squirm. We walk to the van, buckle up, and pull out of the driveway, headed to who knows where.</p><p>And, honestly, I don\u2019t care.</p><p>Coffee in hand, highway before me, gorgeous boyfriend to my left, this day is bound to be good.</p><p>33</p><p>Eight hours later, under the setting sun, I\u2019m standing at the cemetery entrance wondering how it came to this. The chill shooting down my spine makes me rethink my decision to head in alone. I gesture to Luke in the van, and he quickly kills the engine and appears at my side.</p><p>I grab his hand and it gives me the will to move.</p> <p>The scene before me reminds me too much of the funeral in my notes and emblazoned in my brain, a vision now so confusing it hurts.</p><p>It was sweet of Luke to take me there, to Lingering Pines Retirement Community. He had read all about it last night and explained on the way that meeting my grandmother in person would be best. He had printed a map, and he bought travel snacks when he left my house. He\u2019d also gone home to shower and change his clothes so that his parents wouldn\u2019t worry.</p><p>During the drive, Luke talked through every giggle-inducing, glow-generating, lust-inspiring detail of the night before. At times, I wanted to tell him to pull off the road so that I could jump across the center divider and have my way with him.</p><p>He told me about me: all the notes he\u2019d read and thoughts he had about what my life must be like.</p><p>Luke talked about us meeting as kids, about being drawn to me from childhood. About the shoe game.</p><p>We chatted and sipped lattes and ate M&amp;M\u2019s and peanut butter crackers, and I was calm and happy and loved.</p><p>But then we arrived.</p><p>What I saw of Lingering Pines was the reception desk, where a fat young nurse checked a computer and called her supervisor before pulling me aside to whisper in my face with onion breath that Jo Lane had in fact lived there for five years until she moved on.</p> <p>\u201cWhere did she go?\u201d I asked innocently, not getting it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to be the one telling you this, but Jo passed last winter,\u201d the young nurse said. \u201cShe died,\u201d she added, probably because of my dazed look.</p><p>That\u2019s about the point when I felt myself being strapped onto a roller-coaster ride that I didn\u2019t stand in line for. After having the wherewithal to glean as much additional information as possible, Luke guided my stupefied self back to the van and drove me far away from Lingering Pines, never pressing too hard but letting me know he was there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, London,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know her,\u201d I said back, my mind reeling. The miles flew by then. We were headed home, and I was not only empty-handed but downright mystified as well.</p><p>The questions in my mind were the same then and now.</p><p>How can she be dead? She\u2019s in my future. Am I wrong about the woman at the child\u2019s funeral? Is it someone who just looks like my grandma? I need to check that photo again. Maybe I should show it to my mom. Maybe my grandma has a sister. A twin sister.</p><p>Each thought stands in turn in front of my mind\u2019s eye for a mental audition, but no one gets the part. No thought is just right.</p><p>\u201cThanks for bringing me here,\u201d I say quietly, cutting through the silence as Luke and I move straight down the center aisle of the graveyard.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Luke says softly. He keeps his eyes on the sea of stone going by. Our feet crunch on dirt and rocks as we walk, and I\u2019m desperately trying to remain rational, to not picture zombies digging themselves up from underground or ghosts whispering in my ear.</p><p>Unsure of exactly what I\u2019m looking for, my eyes instinctively seek the familiar: the groundskeeper\u2019s shack disguised as a mausoleum.</p><p>Tracking my gaze, Luke squeezes the hand he holds tight.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where the smoking guy will be, right?\u201d he asks. His simple question gives me a strange sense of calm. Belonging, even. From reading my life, Luke not only understands me, but he remembers, too. In a way, he has become the closest thing to a memory I might ever have.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say with a nod, keeping my eyes focused there.</p><p>I\u2019m so absorbed that I see the movement from inside that anyone else might have missed in the dying light. \u201cLet\u2019s go over,\u201d I say, pulling Luke off the main path and onto a smaller branch cutting through graves toward the shed. I lift my hand to knock, but the door opens before I get the chance.</p><p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d says a cherub-faced man with a beard like Santa Claus\u2019s. \u201cHow can I help you kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I begin timidly, trying to find my words. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a grave. My grandmother\u2019s grave, actually. I didn\u2019t know her, and we were wondering whether there\u2019s some sort of directory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA directory, huh? The only directory you\u2019ll find here is locked in my noggin,\u201d the man says with a kind smile and a tap, forefinger to temple. \u201cMy mind is like a steel trap: it never lets anything out. What was your grandmother\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>I glance at Luke before turning back to Santa.</p><p>\u201cJo Lane,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cShe died last winter,\u201d Luke offers.</p><p>Santa scratches his head, muttering, \u201cLane... Lane, hmm...\u201d I watch; the caretaker seems familiar to me. Maybe it\u2019s just that he looks like Santa Claus.</p><p>Luke and I catch gazes again, and just as I\u2019m wondering whether Santa\u2019s brain isn\u2019t as advertised, his weathered face brightens.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it. Aisle thirteen, plot two hundred forty-seven. Or is it two hundred forty-eight? Follow me, please.\u201d He steps onto the path and leads us in the opposite direction from which we came. We follow, farther away from the safety of the main walkway, right into the thick of death.</p><p>As Luke and I gingerly step behind the crunch, crunch, crunch of Santa\u2019s work boots, at least one of us wonders about the sanity of someone who chooses to work at a cemetery. As he moves, Santa mutters under his breath about Jo Lane\u2019s funeral.</p><p>\u201cSad turnout, that one. Only just the man and the priest. Poor woman.\u201d</p><p>Blameless, I\u2019m guilty just the same.</p><p>I\u2019m preoccupied by the eeriness of the passing graves, now that it\u2019s officially dark outside. Low-hanging trees make it even darker. It feels like the dead of night, even though it\u2019s barely six thirty.</p><p>Abruptly, the caretaker stops moving, and Luke grabs my waist to keep me from running into the old man.</p><p>\u201cHere she is, two hundred thirty-seven,\u201d Santa says, gesturing to the simple rectangular granite grave marker at his feet. I can\u2019t help but think that he\u2019s standing on my grandmother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper, edging closer to the stone.</p><p>\u201cNo trouble,\u201d Santa says, turning back toward the shed. \u201cTake your time; I\u2019ll close up when you leave.\u201d</p><p>I hear his boots crunch away as my eyes lock on the piece of stone like it\u2019s going to grow a mouth and tell me all the answers.</p><p>WIFE, MOTHER, GRANDMOTHER, FRIEND</p> <p>JOSEPHINE LONDON LANE</p><p>JULY 10, 1936\u2014DECEMBER 10, 2009</p><p>Tears sting my eyes for a woman I never knew. My namesake, apparently. Luke wraps his arm around my shoulders and pulls me close to his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer truthfully. I feel like I\u2019m outside the scene, watching it unfold instead of living it.</p> <p>We stand there a short while, and when it feels right, I take a step back.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I say to Luke.</p><p>He quietly leads me back the way we came, through the graves and toward the caretaker\u2019s shed. It\u2019s impossible for me not to picture the darkness: I can see the younger, handsome, and seemingly out of place groundskeeper smoking now, consoling me from afar. In my memory, I\u2019m looking at him from the direction we\u2019re now facing. In my memory, I am standing way over...</p><p>My heart leaps and my feet stop as I see it: the green stone angel who cries that day in the future.</p><p>Luke turns to face me and asks what\u2019s wrong. Instead of answering, I take off running.</p><p>\u201cLondon?\u201d Luke calls after me.</p> <p>I hear him running, too; I\u2019m reassured by the heavy thud of his steps in my wake. At least if I hit a tree or encounter a ghost, he\u2019ll find me quickly.</p><p>My North Star in the expanse of graves, the crying angel stands tall above her silent neighbors, keeping watch in the night.</p><p>As I approach, the butterflies in my stomach breed and multiply in fast-forward. My side aches from sprinting, and vomit threatens to rise in my throat. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the exertion or the anticipation that\u2019s making me feel sick, but I swallow hard to keep it at bay.</p><p>Soon enough, I am at the angel\u2019s base. Instead of lingering, I turn in the direction I remember, facing the location of the funeral in my mind.</p><p>Instead of the nothing I expect\u2014the vacant plot waiting for the helpless being, the child\u2014there is something.</p><p>Slowly, trying to catch my breath, I creep toward it, my mind clicking and spinning and working on the problem it can\u2019t seem to sort out. Until there it is.</p><p>The answer.</p><p>I find myself standing in the exact spot as in my dark memory, facing not a freshly dug hole but a tasteful, polished headstone surrounded by mature plantings. Light from the street lamp outside the iron fence bounces just right; I can read the ornate lettering plain as day.</p> <p>I swallow back bile as Luke stomps up next to me. At least I think it\u2019s Luke. I don\u2019t turn to check.</p><p>\u201cI lost you back there for a second,\u201d his familiar voice pants as he catches his breath.</p><p>Staring, I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019m still breathing at all.</p><p>I stand motionless, eyes locked on the letters. Out of my peripheral vision, I see Luke read them, too, then glance up toward the groundskeeper\u2019s shack in the distance and to the green angel to the left.</p><p>\u201cWait, is this...\u201d His voice trails off midquestion, and, finally, he joins me in the realization. \u201cWhoa,\u201d is all my boyfriend says, before taking my hand and staring right along with me.</p><p>When the groundskeeper approaches and scolds us for running through the cemetery and disturbing the peace, I turn to realize that it is him.</p><p>He\u2019s older now, fatter and bearded, but were he smiling in sympathy instead of scowling and annoyed, he would look the same. I can see now what I couldn\u2019t see before: I can see him beneath the years.</p><p>Luke and I grudgingly agree to leave, but not before I take one last long, hard look at the engraving that will derail my life forever.</p><p>SWEET BABY BOY</p><p>JONAS DYLAN LANE</p><p>NOVEMBER 7, 1998\u2014MAY 8, 2001</p><p>34</p><p>It punches me in the gut once more, just like the first time I read it and the time after that.</p><p>The funeral was in the past.</p><p>The past.</p><p>And I remember it.</p><p>I was so focused on the who that I completely missed the when.</p><p>Walking toward the cemetery gates, my head spins so much it aches. Inside the van, Luke cranks the heat and we begin to defrost as we drive in silence toward my house. I am paralyzed by emotion. Not until we exit the freeway and turn left into my development does Luke speak.</p><p>\u201cYou have to talk to your mom,\u201d he says.</p><p>I watch the houses that I remember from tomorrow go by and wonder whether a part of me remembers them from yesterday, too. All the rules to my world are being challenged with this one discovery. The simplicity of knowing what\u2019s coming isn\u2019t so simple after all.</p><p>I find myself wanting to call Jamie. Wishing I could. I shake off the thought and watch the houses some more.</p><p>As Luke pulls into my driveway, the porch light blinks on. I glance at the dashboard clock and realize that it\u2019s nearly eight o\u2019clock, which is not so strange, except that I left before eleven this morning and haven\u2019t called since.</p><p>\u201cShe must be worried.\u201d Luke says what I\u2019m thinking.</p><p>\u201cShe should be,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cGo easy on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d I reply weakly before I slide out of the van and head inside to confront my mother and discover the truth about my missing memories.</p><p>35</p><p>\u201cWho was Jonas?\u201d I ask again, somehow guessing the answer but needing confirmation.</p><p>My mother\u2019s eyes share a mixture of shock and sorrow that makes me want to look away.</p><p>But I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWho was he, Mom?\u201d I ask a third time, softer now.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know...\u201d She looks down at her hands. I stay still, watching her realize that how doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Mom lifts her gaze once more, but though her head is high now, her posture has cracked.</p><p>\u201cJonas was your brother,\u201d she says in a near whisper.</p><p>I am silent, unable to ask her to go on, but she does anyway.</p><p>\u201cHe died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I was at the cemetery. I saw his tombstone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy...\u201d She stops herself. \u201cWell, that part doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you how I ended up there after you tell me what happened to my brother,\u201d I say, a tear racing down my cheek, \u201cand why you lied about him. Lied about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, London, I didn\u2019t lie. I kept a very sad truth from you. I thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, that I should be blissfully stupid my whole life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I could save you the pain,\u201d Mom says, touching her hand to her cheek in anticipation of tears to come. I can see that I\u2019ve exposed an old wound. A very deep, painful one.</p><p>\u201cSomething terrible happened to him a long time ago,\u201d Mom begins, glancing at me every so often but mostly watching the patterns in the carpet, as if they\u2019re feeding her lines. \u201cYour brother was taken. And killed.\u201d</p><p>I inhale sharply. \u201cWho did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never knew.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s shoulders are heaving now, and I\u2019m the parent for a moment as I walk over to the couch and hold her in my arms. She cries on my shoulder for a brother I can\u2019t remember.</p><p>I want to know more, but I can see that talking about it is devastating to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she composes herself, she pulls back, hands on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to deceive you, London, you have to know that,\u201d she says, looking right into me. \u201cYou lost your memory of the past, and I saw that as the one bright spot in all the darkness.

A little.</p><p>I break free from my mother\u2019s grasp and move to one of the cushiony chairs opposite the TV.

I know you want to understand your life.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I look into my mom\u2019s dark eyes. For the first time, I understand the tinge of anguish that will always be there, even during happy occasions.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember him. I don\u2019t remember anything. But she remembers all of it.</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s more than wanting to understand. I think I need to hear about him. I think it might help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asks, confused.</p> <p>Finally, I share with my mom what\u2019s been building, what I know from notes that I\u2019ve kept from the one person I should have opened up to long ago.</p><p>\u201cI want you to tell me everything, because I think it might help me remember my past,\u201d I say.</p><p>My mother sighs and rubs her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLondon, you\u2019ve been to doctors who have tried to jog your memory. I even took you to a hypnotist once. Why do you think that my telling you the story of your brother\u2019s death will change things now?\u201d</p><p>And here it is: the moment of truth. I check the clock on the wall for no particular reason. Then I shift in my seat, and pull myself tighter into a knot. I take a deep breath, and, finally, I tell my mother what she needs to hear.</p><p>\u201cMom, I remember Jonas\u2019s funeral.\u201d</p><p>Written 2/19; include in notes every night.</p><p>This morning I woke up remembering a memory I\u2019m sure will stay with me forever. It\u2019s a funeral... it was my brother Jonas\u2019s. It\u2019s the one past memory I have.</p> <p>Mom kept it from me for years. She wanted to protect me. It\u2019s hard not to be mad at her, but I try not to be. She didn\u2019t think I needed the pain on top of the stress of the memory thing. She has to live with it every day and didn\u2019t want me to have to, too.</p><p>Mom wasn\u2019t there when it happened but told me the story. Jonas and I were with Dad. I was six and Jonas was two. We were at the grocery store and Dad went over to get a cart. He left us in the car alone for two minutes. He just walked across the parking lot, and when he came back, Jonas was gone.</p><p>I guess Dad told Mom I was screaming about a van and pointing at one leaving the parking lot, so Dad jumped in the car and chased it. She said it\u2019s all he could do. But after a couple of blocks, the van made a light that turned red as Dad and I approached. He tried to floor it. There was an accident. Mom says our car was demolished; I was hurt pretty badly. I was in a coma, and early one morning, at 4:33 a.m., I died. Obviously, they brought me back, but Mom thinks that\u2019s why my brain resets then.</p><p>After that, apparently my normal memory was gone. I didn\u2019t remember the accident. I didn\u2019t remember Jonas.</p><p>Mom kicked Dad out. She blamed him for losing Jonas and seriously hurting me. He probably blamed himself, too.</p><p>I asked Mom about the birthday cards from Dad in the manila folder in the desk drawer. I found them in her closet last fall. She was a little mad about the snooping, but she said that Dad tried to get in touch three times, but each time she told him to leave us alone. She explained that she was very bitter then. She just seems sad now. Maybe Mom and Dad should talk. I might need to talk to Dad, too.</p><p>Two years after he was kidnapped, police found a few of Jonas\u2019s bones and his clothes in the mountains west of town. We buried him then. That\u2019s the funeral I remember.</p><p>I\u2019m writing this down so I can leave it for myself every night. I know it will be hard to read each morning, but it\u2019s important. I owe it to Jonas.</p><p>I owe it to my brother to remember him.</p><p>36</p><p>By all accounts, it\u2019s a beautiful April morning.</p><p>Tomorrow is Monday, so today is the weekend.</p><p>I sit on a swivel chair at the glass-top table on the patio, drinking a latte that my mom made unprompted. The sun is up on the other side of the house, so I sit in the shade with a light breeze rustling my unkempt hair.</p><p>I\u2019m still wearing pajamas\u2014a supersoft T-shirt and lightweight drawstring shorts\u2014with fuzzy fleece slippers that I don\u2019t remember breaking in on my feet.</p><p>I\u2019ve just finished a delicious toasted bagel with cream cheese, and I\u2019ve just read through a pile of notes about a megawonderful boy named Luke. Apparently I\u2019ve been dating him for almost six months. It\u2019s too nice a day to dwell on the fact that I don\u2019t seem to remember him, backward or forward.</p><p>I sigh, in the manner of Snow White before the whole apple thing, and pick up the other letter that was left on the nightstand this morning. It is weathered and smudged, and I can\u2019t help but wonder how many mornings I\u2019ve read the words before me now.</p><p>Sighing again, I shake my hair out of my face, take a slow sip of latte, and smooth the page. The words hit me like a sledgehammer.</p><p>Tears upon tears splat onto the lined pages in my hands as I discover a nightmare come true. Quickly, I wipe away the salt water so it won\u2019t fade the ink. Because even as my chest caves in and makes me hate the chipper birds and everything else, I know that I needed to read this today, and I need to read it again tomorrow.</p><p>For me, reading is remembering.</p><p>37</p><p>\u201cDoes it ever get easier?\u201d I ask my mom before I open the door to the Prius. We are sitting in the drop-off area at school. My eyes are red and puffy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, London,\u201d my mom says softly, placing a hand on mine. \u201cFor me, time lessens the pain. I don\u2019t know how it will be for you. It\u2019s new to you every day.\u201d</p><p>My mother looks tormented as she says this. I don\u2019t answer. She hesitates like she wants to say something, like she\u2019s debating with herself. The side that wants to speak wins.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, I think you should consider getting rid of that letter,\u201d she says carefully.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon, think about it. Jonas wouldn\u2019t want you to be so hurt on his behalf every morning. He wouldn\u2019t want you to grieve for him anew each day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? He was a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA happy baby! A baby who giggled constantly and made you laugh and was your biggest fan. I\u2019ll show you the videos again, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are videos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, London,\u201d Mom says quietly. \u201cAnyway, the point is that I know his little soul wouldn\u2019t want his big sister to be so miserable.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I unbuckle my seat belt and open the door, ready to go inside.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I owe it to him,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cTo remember him today and every other day.\u201d I\u2019m quoting myself from the note I read this morning, but it\u2019s how I feel.</p><p>My mother sighs deeply.

London Lane, are you in there?\u201d</p><p>I look up to find two rows of gawking students and a slightly agitated Mr. Hoffman staring at me expectantly.</p> <p>I completely missed the question, but after a quick glance at the board, I know what he asked.</p><p>\u201cF prime,\u201d I mutter, thankful that I managed to remember the benign parts of this morning\u2019s briefing in addition to those very, very cancerous ones that were distracting me in the first place.</p><p>\u201cVery good, Ms. Lane. Feel free to zone out again,\u201d Mr. Hoffman says, with a wink that tries too hard to be cool.</p><p>Poor Mr. Hoffman. He will never succeed.</p><p>A girl with poodle hair in front of me leans back so far in her creaky, overused chair that her locks rest on the pages of my open notebook. The tangled tresses obscure nothing, since I\u2019ve taken no notes. My blank notepad and mechanical pencil are props, like the backpack in the basket below my seat and, quite frankly, the schoolbooks inside of it.</p><p>I brush her hair off my paper anyway, and she twists around with a stern look on her face. She combs her fingers through her hair as the bell rings.</p> <p>I gather my things and head toward the door of the classroom, then merge into the swarm of students buzzing from this class to that one.</p><p>When I make it to my locker, I see Jamie across the hallway, standing on her own. I adjust the metal door so I can see her reflection in the mirror.</p><p>Jamie shuffles a few books around, then sets her bag on the floor and grabs a lip gloss off the top shelf. After carefully applying it, she hoists her bag on her shoulder and slams her locker shut.</p><p>She turns in my direction and hesitates. Just as I think she\u2019s going to come talk to me, she turns on her heels and walks off down the hall. When she\u2019s gone, I slam my own locker shut and follow her, twenty paces behind, wishing all the way we were arm in arm.</p><p>Jamie is eyeing me suspiciously across our desk island. We\u2019re supposed to be working together to create a fictitious travel itinerary for a two-week vacation in Mexico. It\u2019s busywork, and normally I\u2019d be all for it.</p><p>Later in life, I\u2019ll do a lot of traveling. But today, I\u2019m not interested.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I hiss at her. I\u2019m not in the mood.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she says, taken aback by my atypically harsh response.</p> <p>I pull the Mexico travel guide toward me and randomly open it to the section on Isla de Mujeres. I can\u2019t help but laugh. I remember being there. With Jamie. A slightly more weathered but still gorgeous Jamie.</p><p>Flipping through the hotels section, I come across photos that give me the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. A hotel on a private island, surrounded by the clearest, bluest ocean imaginable.</p><p>It reminds me of Luke\u2019s eyes, staring into me this morning in study hall.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile more broadly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Jamie asks bitingly.</p><p>\u201cNothing, this hotel just looks nice,\u201d I say, turning the book to show her.</p><p>I wonder whether right now I\u2019m planting our getaway idea deep in my subconscious. I wonder whether somehow a little piece of me will remember today when Jamie and I finally do plan the trip.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Jamie is shrugging, looking at the glorious hotel. \u201cI\u2019ve seen better.\u201d</p><p>I take back the book and start working on our assignment. Jamie sits quietly for a few seconds, then surprises me with a question.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I look up at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been crying,\u201d she practically whispers, checking to make sure no one else is eavesdropping. I like that she\u2019s concerned about embarrassing me.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, shrugging myself this time. \u201cI\u2019ve had some stuff going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jamie says, looking down at her lap. For a moment, I think my memory is wrong, that it won\u2019t take another few weeks for us to make up. But then, as quick as it was there, Jamie\u2019s compassion is gone.</p><p>\u201cThe period is halfway over. Give me that. I\u2019ll do it,\u201d she says, grabbing the book from me. Immediately, she goes to work on a faux itinerary for a trip that she doesn\u2019t know she\u2019ll eventually take... with me.</p><p>As I watch my best friend work on our joint assignment alone, I feel strangely invigorated. I know she wants to ask me what\u2019s wrong. I know she cares that I\u2019m upset. I know she misses me.</p><p>And knowing all that motivates me.</p><p>I\u2019ll get my best friend back.</p><p>But first, I\u2019ll break up the relationship that will do nothing but cause her heartache.</p><p>38</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Luke asks.</p><p>\u201cJust drive,\u201d I say. \u201cTurn left at the light.\u201d</p><p>Luke does as I instruct, and then protests. \u201cI thought you wanted to hang out after school. Not go on a stakeout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d I say. I point as I command, \u201cTurn right and then slow down. I need to look for the house number.\u201d</p><p>Written on a scrap of paper is 1553 Mountain Street. It\u2019s amazing what you can find in the phone book.</p><p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d I say, reflexively ducking down in my seat. \u201cThe white one on the right. The one with the black shutters. Pass it and park down the street.\u201d</p><p>Luke shakes his head but does as I ask. He pulls the van into a spot and puts it in park. I reach over and turn down the radio, even though it\u2019s already low. Then I turn it off.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d have to have bionic ears to have heard that, you know,\u201d Luke laughs.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d I say to him, craning my neck to see the house behind us.</p><p>\u201cHere, try this,\u201d Luke says, flipping down the passenger-side visor and revealing a mirror. I adjust it and see the house without turning my head.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he says, looking at me curiously. \u201cSo, what now? What are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching the house,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Luke asks.</p><p>\u201cThe Messenger,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cThe Messenger,\u201d he repeats flatly, leaning back in his seat and staring out the window at nothing.</p><p>A car pulls into a driveway a few houses in front of us, and a woman struggles to carry two armfuls of bags inside. The wind doesn\u2019t want her to make it. It blinds her with her own hair and presses against her shoulders.</p><p>I try to explain the situation to Luke.</p><p>\u201cI need to figure out who Mr. Rice\u2019s wife tutors,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know she\u2019s a tutor?\u201d Luke asks.</p><p>I roll my eyes at him and reply, \u201cBecause I do. Jesse Henson will tell me next year that Mrs. Rice is a better math tutor than Ms. Hanover is a teacher.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho is Jesse Henson?\u201d Luke asks, totally missing the point.</p><p>\u201cJust a girl in my math class next year,\u201d I say, annoyed. \u201cShe\u2019ll sit next to me. She\u2019s chatty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what, you want to find out who Mrs. Rice tutors now so you can tell that kid about her husband?\u201d Luke asks, finally seeing the light.</p><p>I nod once.</p> <p>\u201cBut won\u2019t the person just tell Mrs. Rice it was you who told?\u201d Luke asks, confused.</p><p>\u201cNot if I\u2019m smart,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he says, and I wonder whether he means it. Luke strums his hands on the steering wheel like he\u2019s bored.</p><p>Nothing is happening at the Rice house, and I\u2019m growing less and less excited about my mission by the second.</p><p>Sighing, I change the subject.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think of hypnotism?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think about it,\u201d Luke says, looking at me now with his soft blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, do for a minute. Do you think that I could be hypnotized to remember more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore what? Past or future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither one,\u201d I say, but I don\u2019t really mean it. Remembering the future feels normal to me. The one past memory in my brain is like a splinter. It doesn\u2019t belong.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a hypnotist could jog your memory about me,\u201d Luke mutters, looking back to the street.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say, focusing again on the house behind me. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to date someone who remembers you every morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Luke says. \u201cThen again, maybe you\u2019d get bored with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I reply. \u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s up to you,\u201d Luke answers. His noncommittal comment bugs me. I glance his way to roll my eyes at him, and then I look back at the house.</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>\u201cI want whatever you want, as far as your brain is concerned. I love you no matter what,\u201d Luke says, and when I turn to face him, our eyes lock.</p><p>I wonder whether my heart keeps time even when my head doesn\u2019t. Maybe that\u2019s why I feel so much for Luke right now, even though I technically just met him this morning in study hall.</p><p>Something catches my eye and ruins the moment. A white car zips past us, and I can only assume that it\u2019s being driven by someone who can\u2019t see the future dangers of reckless driving.</p> <p>It turns without slowing into the driveway in front of the white house with the black shutters: 1553 Mountain Street.</p><p>The Messenger has arrived.</p><p>I wait excitedly as the person turns off the car, gets organized, and opens the door. Forgoing the mirror, I turn in my seat to get a better look just as long blonde hair appears from the car.</p><p>I focus and then groan.</p><p>The Messenger is Carley Lynch, making things a touch more complicated. Originally, I was just going to \u201cencourage\u201d the Messenger to stumble upon Jamie and Mr. Rice. Now, with Carley involved, I need to modify the plan.</p><p>Carley Lynch would never take a suggestion from me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Luke asks an hour later, tossing a small decorative pillow up in the air and catching it over and over again. I want to grab the pillow and throw it out the window.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, remembering plenty of instances when Carley will make her feelings known, ranging from times she\u2019ll merely scowl at me to those special occasions when she\u2019ll bitingly comment on my clothes, walk, or general existence.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just remember what you\u2019ll do and do that?\u201d Luke presses, still tossing the stupid pillow.</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I shout at him. \u201cDo you think I\u2019d be worrying about this if I remembered how to solve it? My memories of Jamie and Mr. Rice end much later, and very badly. What I\u2019m trying to do now is change all that. I\u2019m flying blind here, buddy. Perhaps you could help me out a little instead of playing catch with that stupid pillow.\u201d</p><p>Just then, Luke\u2019s most recent toss lands in his hands, and instead of releasing it again, he sets the pillow aside.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, sitting up and looking right at me. \u201cCome sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d I say, like a mad little girl. But somehow, Luke\u2019s sweet eyes and gentle smile sand off my rough edges. Soon enough, I\u2019m lounging with him on my bed, brainstorming the path that will lead to the premature demise of Jamie\u2019s affair.</p><p>We\u2019re still on my bed when my mom knocks once and comes into my room at 9:45. She\u2019s home late, and, frankly, I\u2019d forgotten about her. I\u2019d forgotten about dinner and time and everything else.</p><p>\u201cOh, Luke!\u201d Mom says. She looks at him splayed out on top of the covers.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re hatching a plan,\u201d I explain when she shoots a warning glance my way. It\u2019s not much of an explanation, but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice, but why don\u2019t you continue this tomorrow? It\u2019s getting late,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Luke asks, leaning over so that he can see the clock on the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cAlmost ten,\u201d Mom answers.</p><p>Quickly, Luke scoots to the edge of the bed and throws on his shoes.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mom\u2019s going to freak.\u201d</p><p>Luke stands and then squats down in front of me and kisses me on the lips right in front of my mom.</p><p>Gutsy. I like it.</p><p>Then he throws on his jacket, waves good-bye to both of us, and hurries out of the room. I hear him bound down the stairs and out the door, closing it with a slam behind him.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say to my mom when we\u2019re alone. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how late it got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie,\u201d she says, smoothing my hair. \u201cLuke is a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I really like him,\u201d I say. \u201cI think I love him.\u201d</p><p>I wonder whether my mom is going to give me a lecture on young love and chastity and all that humiliating stuff, but she doesn\u2019t. Instead, she surprises me by saying simply, \u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>After a hug, she leaves me alone in my room feeling happy about the day and wishing that I could hold on to it forever.</p><p>Instead, I get to work. Without Luke\u2019s hotness to distract me, and with the help of my notes, I brainstorm. In the end, it\u2019s crystal clear: I\u2019ll make the gossip superhighway work for me.</p><p>With the unwitting assistance of Gabby Stein, future valedictorian Christopher Osborne, Alex Morgan, and, ultimately, Carley Lynch, I\u2019ll save Jamie.</p><p>That is, if all the dominoes fall as they should.</p><p>39</p><p>Following detailed instructions from this morning\u2019s note, I shove the folded paper into Gabby Stein\u2019s locker seconds before students start arriving to dress down for gym. Without being too obvious about it, I watch Gabby find the note, read it, and blush.</p><p>In that moment, I know that domino number one will fall: Gabby will go to the Driver\u2019s Ed. room at lunch looking for Christopher. Unless there is some uncontrollable coincidence, he obviously won\u2019t be there. But I know from notes that Jamie and Mr. Rice will be.</p><p>That\u2019s gossip too rich for Gabby to keep to herself.</p><p>Five periods later, I arrive early to Brit. Lit., anxiously awaiting the arrival of Gabby and my next domino, the evil Alex Morgan.</p><p>Gabby shows first, and I know by looking at her that she saw them. She\u2019s practically bursting with her newfound secret. I try to hide my excitement as Gabby furiously whispers to Alex the second she arrives. Then, before the bell\u2014before Ms. Jenkins can remind her about the \u201cno texting in class\u201d rule\u2014Alex types and sends a message on her cell phone that I can only hope is meant for Carley. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After school, I ask Luke to drive me to an address from this morning\u2019s note.</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>Luke drives but doesn\u2019t seem happy about it. When we arrive, he pulls into a space down the block and points to the house in question. In minutes, a white car zips into the driveway. Carley Lynch gets out.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you looking for this time?\u201d Luke asks.</p><p>I squint to be sure, and then I answer.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d I say, pointing.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Carley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Carley. Her expression. Her posture.

It\u2019s not something you see every day. Students are whispering; Carley Lynch\u2019s friends are consoling her at the top of the main hall.</p><p>It\u2019s all a bit unnerving.</p><p>When I arrive at Spanish, I find that Jamie is already there, leaning on top of her desk with her chin on her arms. She looks like she\u2019s been crying.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, J?\u201d I ask softly as I sit down next to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asks, without looking at me.</p><p>I think forward to whispers about Jamie in the hallway. To a hostile courtroom. A testimony. A conviction.</p><p>I lie.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Jamie, but seriously, fight or not, you can talk to me. I\u2019m always here for you.\u201d</p><p>Jamie looks at me with red eyes and a puffy face. The bell rings, and Ms. Garcia starts a Spanish-language movie. A few minutes in, Jamie turns to face me again.</p><p>\u201cWe got caught,\u201d she whispers. Fresh tears well up in her eyes. \u201cThe police took him away this morning. That bitch Carley Lynch told the principal. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the best news you\u2019ve heard all day.\u201d</p><p>I hold her gaze for a while and then whisper back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d I say honestly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>She looks away and doesn\u2019t speak for a moment. Then, finally, she does.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Jamie whispers, so softly I barely hear. Her chin sinks back to her arms.</p><p>I remember notes telling me Jamie\u2019s rule about sharing her future. If there will ever be a time to break the rules, it\u2019s now.</p><p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I whisper, \u201cit\u2019s all going to work out okay. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Luke and I hold hands as we cut across the parking lot at lunch. There\u2019s a strange absence of wind, and it makes me feel even more unsettled than I already do. It\u2019s too calm for the turbulent day.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe they got caught,\u201d I say to Luke as we climb into his van.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d he says with a funny look on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI feel really bad for her. I mean, I read my notes; I was pretty upset about their thing. But I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to jail. And poor Jamie. She has to go to court. And everyone is going to make fun of her. I remember it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are worse things you could remember,\u201d Luke says.</p><p>\u201cThere are worse things I do remember,\u201d I say back, recalling the note about my brother this morning. Right now Jamie\u2019s mistake doesn\u2019t seem so big.</p><p>\u201cGood thing it\u2019s the end of the year,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Luke asks as we pull out of the lot.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll die down by next year,\u201d I report. \u201cJamie\u2019s going to be back to normal by then. Mostly.\u201d</p><p>I sigh the heavy sigh of knowing what\u2019s to come.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice out,\u201d Luke says, changing the subject. \u201cWould a picnic make you feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, imagining lying in the grass, staring at him all lunch period. \u201cYes, I think it would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to ask Jamie to come with us?\u201d Luke offers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea.\u201d I pull out my phone and text the invitation; Jamie immediately writes back. Progress.</p><p>Home for lunch; forgot a book. Thanks though. Really. It means a lot.</p><p>I smile and text back. Anytime, J.</p><p>\u201cIs she coming?\u201d Luke asks.</p><p>\u201cNope, it\u2019s just us.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, I\u2019m waiting for Luke in his minivan in the grocery store parking lot while he buys food.</p><p>I wish he\u2019d hurry up.</p><p>The springtime sun beats down on me through the windshield, and the heat and the stillness slow my breathing, relax my muscles, and muddy my focus. I\u2019m in a daze as I watch a young mother carry her baby inside the store and come out a few minutes later with a box of diapers. A tall man and a short woman rush through the automatic doors, the man checking his watch as he walks. Two children, seemingly without supervision, run through the parking lot and into the store. I wonder where their mother is as I roll my heavy head to the left.</p><p>A face in the van window yanks me back to reality.</p><p>In a minute, I will realize that the woman is probably the mother of the two rambunctious boys I\u2019ve just seen. In a minute, I\u2019ll note that her van in the next space over nearly matches Luke\u2019s, and that she was \u201cjust checking out the newer model,\u201d as she\u2019ll shout to me as a means of explanation. In a minute, my pulse will edge back down to resting.</p><p>But right now, I am rigid. I am terrified of the woman\u2019s big face, flanked by hands cupped so she can see inside the tinted windows. Right now, I am irrationally locking the doors and scooting my body away so that the stranger won\u2019t get me.</p><p>Stranger?</p><p>Get me?</p><p>Even as I think it, I know it\u2019s crazy.</p><p>But then something falls into place.</p><p>I see myself as a little girl. My dad is across the lot, pulling a cart from the return. I\u2019m in the backseat. A toddler is strapped in across from me. It\u2019s my brother, Jonas. I\u2019m playing peekaboo with him. He\u2019s giggling.</p><p>A woman knocks on the window on my side. She seems friendly. She has a nice smile. \u201cI\u2019m a friend of your mommy\u2019s,\u201d I hear her say through the glass. \u201cOpen the door so I can say hi,\u201d she says sweetly. \u201cYou can see my puppy,\u201d she says, holding open a big bag with a tiny dog inside.</p><p>I love dogs, especially tiny ones. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I unbuckle my belt.

He doesn\u2019t like strangers. I turn around to see the man taking him out of his car seat. Jonas doesn\u2019t like it; he\u2019s crying and kicking.</p><p>Then his cries are getting quieter because he\u2019s going away.</p> <p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d I scream as I watch my mommy\u2019s friend and the man put Jonas in a van. I\u2019m never supposed to get out in a parking lot but I do anyway. \u201cDaddy!\u201d I scream and scream until he hears me and runs.</p><p>Daddy listens to what happened and drives fast and chases the van, but we hit a car and that\u2019s all I remember.</p><p>Tears are running down my cheeks when Luke rejoins me in the car.</p><p>\u201cTake me home,\u201d I say quietly, and he does.</p><p>41</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Mom says as she rushes toward me. When she reaches the chair where I\u2019m curled in a ball, wrapped in a woven blanket and otherwise attempting to shield myself from the world, the back of her hand instinctively flits to my forehead.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a fever,\u201d I say, shaking her off. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I just need your help.\u201d</p><p>She takes a step back in her business suit and heels and looks at me warily.</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go to the police,\u201d I say matter-of-factly, my voice slightly muffled since the blanket has crept up toward my mouth. I push it away and sit up.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would we\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know who did it. I know who took Jonas. I remember them.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not surprised by the look of shock on my mother\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, them. A man and a woman. I can see them. I can help the police find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down, sweetie,\u201d my mom says, sitting on the couch to my right. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>I do, and the tears are unleashed again. It\u2019s all my fault.</p><p>\u201cHoney, it\u2019s okay,\u201d my mom whispers, reaching over and stroking my hair. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did!\u201d I wail. \u201cI unlocked the doors! It\u2019s my fault he\u2019s gone. It\u2019s my fault he\u2019s dead!\u201d</p> <p>I pull the blanket back to my face and cry until there\u2019s nothing left.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d my mom says, over and over, and I feel like shaking off her kindness. I don\u2019t deserve it. How can she still love me, knowing I\u2019m the reason Jonas is dead?</p><p>Will she still love me when she hears the rest of the story?</p><p>\u201cMom, that\u2019s not all,\u201d I say through my tears. As terrible as the past memory is, it\u2019s done. What I haven\u2019t shared is the part in the future that hasn\u2019t happened yet. It weighs on me so heavily that I sink lower into the chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, London?\u201d Mom says in a hushed tone, brushing back my hair and wiping away my tears as they\u2019re replaced by new ones. \u201cYou can tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>Desperate to tell someone, I open my mouth and creak out the words.</p><p>\u201cLuke is going to die, too.\u201d</p><p>In a voice so low that my mom has to crouch to hear me, I tell her the future memory that seeing the criminals\u2019 faces has triggered.</p><p>I tell her that it must be in five or six years, judging by my reflection in the storefront window on a city street I don\u2019t recognize. Luke is there.</p><p>I\u2019m clutching a torn piece of paper with an address scrawled on it. We\u2019re watching, until someone emerges. We\u2019re curious. We plan to tell the police.</p><p>A man leaves the brownstone; he\u2019s wearing knockoff dress shoes and a blazer so that he doesn\u2019t look like a kidnapper and a killer, but then and now, I know the truth.</p><p>The man veers off the cobblestones to a side street, then again into an alley. We follow without meaning to, and, with just a couple of wrong turns, the bustling city that felt safe doesn\u2019t seem that way anymore. Luke and I turn back, but it\u2019s too late.</p><p>The man knows we\u2019re there.</p><p>\u201cWhat gives?\u201d he shouts at us. He seems drunk or high. He\u2019s definitely unstable.</p><p>We say nothing for a moment. Then, like that idiot in a horror movie, words that I want to vacuum back in fly out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou took my brother,\u201d I blurt with false conviction.</p><p>\u201cLondon,\u201d Luke whispers harshly, squeezing the hand he\u2019s holding. Luke is sensible.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think, huh?\u201d the man says, edging closer to us.</p><p>I know with every fiber of my being that we\u2019re in the worst kind of danger. This was the wrong move.</p><p>The man is chewing a toothpick, tossing it side to side in his mouth like he doesn\u2019t have a care in the world.</p><p>Instinctively, Luke takes a step forward as if to shield me. The man is no more than ten feet from us.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d I say quietly to Luke. I\u2019m terrified. I step back and tug on his hand.</p><p>Without warning, the man reaches around his back, up and under his jacket, his right hand emerging heavy.</p><p>He has a gun.</p><p>I shiver as I describe this part to my mom, and she moves to the very edge of the couch so that she can touch my knee for support.</p><p>My cell phone buzzes as a text comes through, and I know without looking that it\u2019s Luke. I ignore it.</p><p>\u201cGo on, it\u2019s okay,\u201d she encourages me.</p><p>I tell her that the man points the gun at us and holds it steady. Of course the murderer has a gun. How could we be so stupid?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you leave now, can I?\u201d the man asks, eyes narrow and dark.</p><p>He takes another step, gun still pointed, and Luke must know what\u2019s coming, because at that moment, he does something heroic. Or stupid.</p><p>Luke drops my hand, shoves me away toward the mouth of the alley, and shouts, \u201cLondon, run!\u201d at the top of his lungs.</p><p>And I try.</p><p>But the bullets stop me.</p><p>My mom\u2019s hands are covering her mouth now as I tell her the rest: the world going silent after the shots stop; the rhythmic footfalls of the man fleeing the scene; the minutes when I believe I\u2019m dying, lying faceup staring at a starless city sky. The guttural groans that pull me from my trance and drag me toward my dying boyfriend.</p><p>I pause to take a few deep breaths and then tell my mom about Luke\u2019s final moments. No last words. No sentiments. Just Luke, gasping for air, raw terror in his eyes.</p><p>42</p><p>I blubber my way through the end of the story, nose running, eyes overflowing, shoulders heaving. It\u2019s contagious, and my mom and I cry together for the past and the future.</p><p>When there are no more tears, my mom startles me by standing and slapping her thighs as she rises.</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d she commands me. I am now so buried in the cushions someone might mistake me for furniture.</p><p>\u201cGet up, London,\u201d she says again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can,\u201d she says, leaning over to help me. When she finds one of my hands, she grabs tight and tugs. I can\u2019t help but stand.</p><p>\u201cYou were right, we need to go to the police,\u201d she says, drying my cheeks with her hands. \u201cYou were right. We need help. We\u2019re going to fix this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so huge, I don\u2019t know if we can,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cWe can,\u201d my mom says, in a voice so strong I almost believe her.</p><p>She leaves me standing alone in the center of the living room for a moment and then zips back into the room, keys in hand.</p><p>Before I have time to think about it anymore, my mom is pulling me toward the car.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>One good thing about living in a small town is that it\u2019s possible that, way back in high school, your mother was friends with the man who is now police captain. It means that he might listen to you when others might not.</p><p>\u201cSo you just remembered all this?\u201d Captain Moeller asks, looking back and forth between me and my mom.</p><p>Captain Moeller may have a potbelly and a bald head, but he\u2019s got a kind face and, frankly, he\u2019s our only hope.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say sweetly. \u201cI remember the day of the kidnapping now very clearly. I could help a sketch artist. Or look in a book?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019d be a lot older now,\u201d the captain says softly.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know what I see.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like to try,\u201d my mom says warmly. After exhaling loudly, Captain Moeller gets up. He grabs a binder from the shelf and tosses it on the small table in the corner. Then he retrieves two more, each filled with photos, from the outer office.</p><p>\u201cStart there, London,\u201d he says, then turns to my mom and offers her coffee. She agrees, and he leaves us alone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to help,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cJust try,\u201d my mom whispers back, bringing her chair over to join me at the table. She eyeballs the faces of criminals with me, even though she wouldn\u2019t know the culprits if they walked up to her at the bank.</p> <p>The captain returns and does paperwork while my mom and I examine the photos of criminal after criminal. An hour later, my butt hurts from the hard chair, and I\u2019ve got nothing except that creepy feeling you get from looking at people who might want to do you harm.</p><p>I want to go home and forget all of it. I want to watch a Disney movie to scrub my brain clean. But I know now that I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve regained these horrible memories; all I can do is try to change the ones that are yet to come.</p><p>\u201cHow about doing a sketch?\u201d I offer again.</p><p>\u201cLike I said before, the couple you remember will be much older now. It probably won\u2019t do any good,\u201d Captain Moeller says.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you try that age-progression software on it?\u201d I ask. I\u2019ll watch way too many crime dramas in my lifetime. \u201cDo you have that here?\u201d</p><p>The captain laughs a little.</p><p>\u201cSmart kid you have there, Bridgette,\u201d he says to my mom.</p><p>\u201cShe sure is,\u201d Mom agrees.</p> <p>Captain Moeller looks back at me. \u201cYes, we have that here,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure it would work with a sketch. And besides, our sketch artist has gone home.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the industrial clock behind his head, as does my mom.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jim, I\u2019m sorry to keep you,\u201d Mom says. \u201cYou need to get home to your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Bridgette,\u201d he says with compassion in his eyes. \u201cAnything for you. I remember the incident like it was yesterday.\u201d</p><p>I break away mentally and force myself to remember anything that might help the situation. There is one thing: the piece of paper. The problem is that I remember it from the future.</p><p>My mom chitchats with the captain as I ponder ways to get him interested in the address. In the end, lying wins.</p><p>\u201cBack when it happened, when they took Jonas, the woman dropped a piece of paper with a note on it in our car,\u201d I blurt out. Both adults snap to attention, Mom because she knows I\u2019m lying and Captain Moeller because he seems to be the type of person who responds to carrots.</p><p>\u201cWhat did it say?\u201d the hound dog asks.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not positive, but I think it was an address. There was something about Beacon Street. I remember because I thought it said \u2018bacon\u2019 at first.\u201d I blink twice like an innocent child. My mom\u2019s lips purse but she doesn\u2019t say anything. \u201cI really like bacon,\u201d I add, feeling idiotic as soon as the words leave my lips. Thankfully, Captain Moeller ignores that part.</p><p>\u201cNo city?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, shrugging. Does he expect this to be handed to him on a silver platter?</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll look into it,\u201d he says before his phone rings. He answers, talks briefly, and hangs up. My mom stands to leave. I follow suit. The captain walks us out and shakes both our hands. We leave, dejected and exhausted.</p><p>Halfway home, before we\u2019ve finished ordering our drive-thru meals, Mom\u2019s cell rings. She answers, listens for a moment, and then pulls out of the restaurant sans food. We\u2019ve turned around and are heading back toward the station before I have time to ask why.</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019ll explain when we get there,\u201d my mom says, sitting straight and gripping the wheel like it might fly off at any moment.</p><p>Captain Moeller is waiting for us at the front desk.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming back,\u201d he says as the three of us rush to his office. I wonder what the hurry is.</p><p>Once we\u2019re settled, he explains.</p><p>\u201cI did a quick search on Beacon, London, and it turns out it\u2019s a street in the city,\u201d Captain Moeller begins. \u201cA squad there has been keeping an eye on a building on that street... suspicious activity, I guess. A friend down there was still at his desk: he told me that a man and wife recently rented the space\u2014it\u2019s an office downtown in that older area\u2014and anyway, there have been odd complaints, so they\u2019ve been watching it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat type of complaints?\u201d Mom asks, and I notice that she is clutching her purse like a life vest.</p><p>\u201cCrying children late at night... in a business registered as a pawnshop,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cThe squad has done routine checks twice now and there\u2019s no sign of wrongdoing. But like I said, they\u2019re keeping an eye out.\u201d</p><p>Captain Moeller stops talking a moment and clears his throat.</p><p>I\u2019m confused. My mom might be, too. I can\u2019t be sure.</p><p>\u201cWhat does all this mean, Jim?\u201d she says aloud. \u201cWhy did you want us to come back down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s touchy, and maybe I\u2019m wrong, but this new information piqued my interest,\u201d the captain says, leaning back in his chair and running a hand through what hair he has left. He checks the clock and continues.</p><p>\u201cYou never did an autopsy on Jonas\u2019s body, did you, Bridgette?\u201d</p><p>The question slugs my mom in the gut, and she looks visibly hurt for a split second. Then she recovers.</p><p>\u201cNo, you know that, Jim,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were his clothes\u2014definitely his clothes\u2014and with the decomposition, we decided it was enough.\u201d</p><p>My mouth is ajar now. Hasn\u2019t my mom seen a single crime drama? Maybe she just wanted it to be over. Maybe she just needed to believe, to bury him and move on.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d Mom asks, seeming agitated now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Kids late at night... at a pawnshop that the locals say isn\u2019t open in the daytime. It\u2019s just suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what you mean, Jim,\u201d my mom barks, and suddenly Captain Moeller sits straight in his chair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the pawnshop is a front for an illegal adoption agency. I think they might be stealing and selling kids.\u201d</p><p>My mom\u2019s jaw drops. \u201cSelling kids?\u201d she asks, clearly horror-stricken.</p><p>Captain Moeller rubs his eyes. \u201cIt happens more than you\u2019d think. People can\u2019t have them on their own, and they get impatient because regular adoption takes too long. They turn to illegal baby brokers and fork out thousands to buy Junior, no questions asked.\u201d</p><p>My mom is quiet for a full two minutes before acknowledging the possibility. Finally, she dares to say it aloud: \u201cYou think they stole Jonas and sold him to new parents.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Captain Moeller replies. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get your hopes up, but if that were the case...\u201d</p><p>Mom grabs my hand before interrupting.</p><p>\u201cJonas could be alive.\u201d</p><p>43</p><p>My eyes are still closed, but I\u2019m awake now. The air in the room has shifted.</p> <p>\u201cLondon?\u201d my mom whispers. I ignore her. She whispers again, but not to me. The sound is softer, as if she\u2019s turned to someone in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cI guess she overslept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess so,\u201d the voice whispers back. I wish everyone would shut up. It can\u2019t be time to get ready for school already.</p><p>\u201cLondon, it\u2019s time to get up, honey. You\u2019re going to be late for school,\u201d my mom says in a singsong voice.</p><p>Finally, I let loose a long, audible groan and open my eyes.</p><p>My room is bright with the morning sun; apparently I forgot to shut the shades last night. The clock reads 7:00. Ugh. My mom stands in the doorway with a funny look on her face, blocking another person from view.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask, showing my displeasure.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, London,\u201d she says awkwardly, ignoring my question. \u201cDo you want to read your notes?\u201d</p><p>I furrow my eyebrows at her, and she smiles like a pageant contestant.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I grumble. \u201cWho\u2019s with you?\u201d</p><p>The mystery visitor shifts and the floor creaks. I sit up in bed and try to see around my mom. She stays where she is for a few seconds, then throws up her hands.</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll catch you up,\u201d she says, entering the room and sitting down on the desk chair. The visitor tentatively steps into the room, bearing coffee and a bag of something I hope is a scone. I admire his striking features, piercing eyes, flawlessly messy hair.</p><p>\u201cHey, Luke,\u201d I say, with undertones of seduction that I hope fly over my mother\u2019s head.</p><p>From my right, Mom gasps. Not the reaction I\u2019d expected.</p> <p>Luke looks surprised. Then thrilled. Then skeptical.</p><p>\u201cYou remember him?\u201d my mom asks.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I say, throwing her a look that says I think she\u2019s lost it.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Luke asks. Now I\u2019m furrowing my eyebrows at him, too. What is wrong with everyone?</p><p>\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t looked at your notes yet today?\u201d Mom asks incredulously. I wish she\u2019d leave us alone, because I can think of a better way to spend the few minutes we have before school.</p><p>\u201cIs that coffee for me?\u201d I ask Luke, arms outstretched. Then I answer my mom: \u201cNo, not yet. Why? Why are you acting so weird?\u201d</p><p>She lets loose a silly, girlish giggle, and Luke and I can\u2019t help but laugh with her. When we all compose ourselves, I ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d which sends my mom into hysterics once again.</p><p>Luke crosses the room, hands me my coffee, and sits next to me on the bed. He kisses my cheek and says softly, \u201cYou remember me.\u201d</p><p>I think of Luke tomorrow; I remember him from next year.</p><p>\u201cI get the feeling that I didn\u2019t before,\u201d I say, matching his low tone. Through her laughter, my mom excuses herself and leaves us alone.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Luke says, eyes bright. \u201cBut you do now, and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let me catch up,\u201d I say, grabbing the stack of notes off the bedside table. After I\u2019ve reviewed them, my mood has changed.</p><p>\u201cLuke, we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this about yesterday?\u201d he asks, looking hurt.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, thankful for the details. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty serious.\u201d</p><p>Luke tenses and shifts to face me. \u201cYou\u2019re not breaking up with me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say with a little laugh, brushing his hair out of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust go ahead,\u201d Luke says glumly.</p><p>I take a deep breath, and slowly, carefully, I tell Luke the story of the memory that I know, from my notes, came back to me yesterday. I still remember it today, so I don\u2019t need to look back at my notes to explain everything. I\u2019m detailed but to the point, never wavering until the very end.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, my eyes welling up with tears. Luke and I will have a great relationship. We\u2019ll talk about marriage, but he won\u2019t get the chance to propose. Instead, he\u2019ll die.</p><p>The color drains from Luke\u2019s face, but he doesn\u2019t cry with me. Instead, he\u2019s still, pensive.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I ask after I\u2019ve dried my tears.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Luke says, still immobile. He holds his coffee cup awkwardly by his left leg. I take it from him and set it on the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for telling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t be,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d rather know.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure I feel the same way about my own end, but I don\u2019t admit as much. Luke continues.</p><p>\u201cI think knowing about it is better, because then maybe I can avoid it. We can avoid it together,\u201d he says, with forced strength.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I say, looking into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously. Okay, yes, this is pretty intense. I\u2019m a little... I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t quite process it all right now. But don\u2019t you think the advance warning gives me the advantage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Luke, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really. You changed something with Page. You\u2019ve changed other things, too. You can change this. It won\u2019t happen,\u201d he says with authority, as if he\u2019s trying to convince himself. I guess that\u2019s the best anyone can do with this information.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d I say calmly.</p><p>\u201cI am right,\u201d he says, his voice increasing in volume. \u201cYou\u2019ll change your future. You\u2019ll save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we just won\u2019t go down the alley. Trust me, it won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>Luke hugs me tight and kisses me with such strength that I almost buy his story. But when he releases me, I see it flash across his eyes.</p><p>Fear.</p><p>Hoping to distract him, I offer my notes so that he can read up on yesterday\u2019s events while I get ready for school. As I shower, I can\u2019t help but wonder whether I did the right thing by telling him.</p><p>Then again, maybe he\u2019s right.</p><p>Maybe knowing how to avoid bad situations is enough.</p><p>Reaching for my fluffy white towel hanging on the hook, I think one thought over and over again: Please, be enough.</p><p>44</p><p>Jamie looks at me in Spanish class without grimacing, but the rest of the day is bleak. I float through school in a fog, asking myself questions I can\u2019t answer: Is my brother alive? Will Luke die the death I remember? Will I ever get to meet my father? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Surprisingly, the dad thing is heaviest today. I remember bits of him. I want more.</p><p>I want a dad.</p><p>I want my dad.</p><p>Before bed, I trudge in slipper-clad feet to my desk to power down my laptop. Just as I reach for the mouse, a message box pops up.</p> <p>LJH6678: Hi. Are you awake?</p><p>I recognize Luke\u2019s screen name immediately; he\u2019ll have it for as long as I know him.</p><p>LondonLane: Yep, just getting ready to go to bed.</p><p>LJH6678: I won\u2019t bug you. Just wanted to say good night.</p><p>LondonLane: You\u2019re not bugging me!</p> <p>I stand in front of my desk, staring at the screen, waiting. After a few seconds, he types back.</p><p>LJH6678: I\u2019m glad you told me.</p><p>LondonLane: Are you? I\u2019m still not so sure about it.</p><p>LJH6678: It was the right thing to do.</p><p>LondonLane: If you say so!</p><p>The tiny screen is blank for a bit. I check the clock and shift from one foot to the other before leaning over to type.</p> <p>LondonLane: I should sleep....</p><p>LJH6678: Okay.</p><p>LJH6678: Wait London? I have a question.</p><p>LondonLane: Okay?</p><p>LJH6678: I\u2019ve been thinking about all of this today, about you remembering our whole relationship.</p><p>I slide down into the chair so I can read easier and type faster.</p><p>LondonLane: And?</p><p>A little butterfly pokes me under the rib as I hit enter and wait for Luke\u2019s response.</p> <p>LJH6678: And I\u2019ve been wondering whether you remember everything.</p><p>I ponder the question for a moment, then type.</p><p>LondonLane: I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t remember everything. I remember the future the way you remember the past. You remember the really good and bad and forget some of the middle, right?</p><p>LJH6678: Sure.</p><p>LondonLane: Same with me. Why?</p><p>LJH6678: Do you remember us having sex?</p><p>My hand flies to my mouth, and I look around my room for eavesdroppers, even though I know I\u2019m alone. My stomach won\u2019t stop doing somersaults.</p><p>Luke learned that he\u2019s going to die young today and all he wants to ask me about is sex?</p><p>LJH6678: Well?</p><p>LondonLane: Truth?</p><p>LJH6678: YES!</p><p>LondonLane: Yes.</p><p>LJH6678: Not fair.</p><p>LondonLane: I know but listen. In the way that you probably choose not to think about things that you don\u2019t want to remember, I do the same. It helps things be a little bit... surprising.</p><p>LJH6678: Still not fair. When is it?</p><p>LondonLane: Not telling.</p><p>LJH6678: Seriously, not fair.</p><p>Checking the time again, I lean back in my chair and stretch. The day is wearing on me. I need sleep.</p><p>LondonLane: Luke, I have to go to bed.</p><p>LJH6678: I know, I know. Me, too.</p><p>LondonLane: See you tomorrow?</p><p>LJH6678: Want a ride?</p><p>LondonLane: Of course.</p><p>LJH6678: I\u2019ll bring you treats if you tell me the date.</p><p>LondonLane: You\u2019ll bring me treats anyway.</p><p>LJH6678: I\u2019m going to have to work hard to surprise you, London Lane.</p><p>LondonLane: Yes, you are.</p><p>LJH6678: Night, beautiful girl.</p><p>LondonLane: Night, Luke.</p><p>45</p><p>It\u2019s the last day of my junior year but it might as well be the first. I know the layout of the school from next year, but everything else is gone.</p><p>There is no math class tomorrow to remind me where I sit today. There are no locker trips next week to tell me where mine is located now. Luke can\u2019t exactly escort me around like a guide dog.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay?\u201d Luke asks as he grabs my hand. He looks almost as nervous as I feel. We\u2019re walking in from the student parking lot carrying matching half-empty lattes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay. My mom wrote it all down for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was cool of her,\u201d he says. \u201cHas she heard anything yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet,\u201d I say, feeling a heaviness in my chest that might not ever go away.</p><p>\u201cAt least I can get you to your first class safely,\u201d Luke says, pulling me up the main hallway. We stroll in easy silence, Luke angling me over a couple of times when I almost collide with other students. He laughs when he realizes that I\u2019m looking at their shoes. He walks me to the door of my Pre-calculus classroom and kisses me good-bye.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say back, wanting to handcuff myself to him and make him sit through all my classes with me. Instead, I force myself to go in.</p><p>After class, I hit my locker for a book to read in study hall. Luke reminded me to bring one, since Ms. Mason apparently gets mad when we talk to each other.</p><p>As I approach, I find Jamie standing there waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says softly when I stop in front of the metal door.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say. We\u2019re both silent; I stare at my lock. Without tomorrow as reference, the combination isn\u2019t coming to mind. I pull out my cell, where it\u2019s stored.</p><p>\u201cThirty, twenty-two, five,\u201d Jamie says before I have the chance to look it up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll always have my back,\u201d I reply, spinning the dial.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve always had mine,\u201d Jamie says.</p><p>I look into her eyes and know that this is it: we\u2019re okay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for getting so mad at you about... everything,\u201d Jamie begins.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the awful things I said,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what you said?\u201d Jamie asks.</p><p>I cringe at that part in the notes. \u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cI forced myself to remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was cool of you,\u201d Jamie says. She waits a beat and then gives me a quick hug.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d she whispers into my hair.</p><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Jamie says playfully as she pulls away. \u201cYou can\u2019t even remember me. How can you miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I remember you,\u201d I say. \u201cDo you want to know all the things I remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jamie shouts with a laugh. \u201cKeep your fortune-telling to yourself!\u201d</p><p>Jamie and I link arms and start down the main hall. We laugh together as we walk, and I can\u2019t help but feel overwhelmed by Jamie\u2019s loyalty. Before we part, she turns to face me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s never fight again,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d I reply, knowing that really, other than small disagreements in college, we won\u2019t.</p><p>It makes me realize how much I appreciate Jamie\u2019s willingness to trust me without knowing. She can\u2019t see what\u2019s coming. For Jamie, our relationship is a gamble. And yet she sticks with me. She keeps rolling the dice.</p><p>I stroll into the library for the last time this year, happy that my best friend is betting on us.</p><p>46</p><p>Hours later, after walking into the wrong classroom twice, seeing a little too much of Mike Norris (the boys\u2019 bathrooms near the History wing aren\u2019t properly labeled!), lunching with Luke, and handing in a year-end graphic design project that I could have purchased for $29.95 from CheatersRUs.com, for all I know, the school day and the school year are over.</p><p>Luke drives me home, holding my hand across the center console all the way. I feel like more than the year is ending, but I have my forward memories to prove that it\u2019s not. Still, there\u2019s something bittersweet about our kiss good-bye.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stay up too late tonight,\u201d he calls before I close the door.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I say, laughing and trying not to think of why he wants me to be well rested. I know, but I won\u2019t write it down tonight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Some things should be a surprise.</p><p>Inside, I\u2019m shocked to find my mother, home early, sitting alone at the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cHow was your last day?\u201d she asks, forcing small talk.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cI made it to all of my classes, eventually. I handed in that project. It went as well as possible, I guess. What\u2019s up, Mom?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey want us to come down to the station,\u201d she says nervously.</p><p>\u201cThey know something?\u201d I can feel my brain pulling together pieces from memory and notes to form a complete picture.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mom stands, ready to leave.</p><p>We drive in silence the twelve minutes it takes from the garage to the parking lot in front of the police station. We wait two minutes to see Captain Moeller. When we\u2019re all settled in his office, he tells us that they have conclusive results.</p><p>I move to the edge of my seat. My mom covers her mouth with her hand, presumably to thwart an impending scream.</p> <p>We wait.</p><p>Captain Moeller clears his throat.</p><p>I want to jump across the messy desk and rip the words from his voice box.</p><p>Finally, he speaks.</p><p>\u201cThe boy you buried isn\u2019t Jonas.\u201d</p><p>Captain Moeller\u2019s words hang in the air; I can almost see them floating there. No one speaks. No one moves. When I can\u2019t take the tension anymore, I ask the totally irrelevant question: \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA Baby Doe, probably from another state. He wasn\u2019t in our missing children database.\u201d</p><p>Finally, sound comes from my mother\u2019s mouth in the form of a gasp.</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d Captain Moeller says to my mom.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s next?\u201d she asks through the fingers over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWe reopen the search for Jonas,\u201d Captain Moeller says.</p><p>My mom looks a little like she\u2019s in shock. She doesn\u2019t reply, so the captain keeps going.</p><p>\u201cI took the liberty of having the team use the aging software on the old photo we had of Jonas. We can put that image out over the wire and get people in the area on lookout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he\u2019s not in the area?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll distribute it nationally, too,\u201d he says to me.</p><p>\u201cCan I see it?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says. The captain rifles around on his desk for a bit and unearths a thick, worn file. I wonder how many times it\u2019s been opened over the past decade.</p><p>Captain Moeller pages through the file and pulls out an eight-by-ten photo.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d he says, sliding it across the desk. My mom leans in to see but doesn\u2019t touch. Tears silently flow down her cheeks; she\u2019s so quiet I barely know she\u2019s there.</p><p>Captain Moeller hands her a tissue and leaves us alone. When he\u2019s gone, I pick up the photo for a closer look.</p><p>For some reason, a strange calm washes over me at the sight of him: my brother. My shoulders loosen and I exhale slowly.</p><p>It feels right.</p><p>He seems familiar.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember him? From the future?\u201d my mom asks in a voice so weak it\u2019s like she\u2019s a mouse.</p><p>Excited for a moment, I rack my brain for a memory of my brother\u2014any memory other than the horrific one of him being taken.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom, I don\u2019t,\u201d I say. It causes her tears to flow faster. Instead of comforting her, I continue to stare.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing there, and yet...</p><p>There\u2019s something.</p><p>Like that punch line of a joke you forget by the end, there\u2019s something.</p><p>And to me, right now, something is just fine.</p><p>47</p><p>Luke parks directly in front of a NO TRESPASSING sign on the barbed-wire fence that keeps us from driving off the incline. He kills the engine and the headlights along with it.</p><p>The town twinkles below, and I inhale the warm evening through the open windows.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring me here to kill me?\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d he says warmly. \u201cThis is a do-over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf our first date,\u201d he says, staring into my eyes. \u201cWe fell asleep; you forgot to write it down. I\u2019ve told you about it. You\u2019ve probably read about the morning after...\u201d</p><p>My cheeks flush.</p><p>\u201c... but you didn\u2019t experience it. So I\u2019m doing it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awesome,\u201d I say, without thinking too much about it. Luke grins sheepishly and heads to the back of the van to get some pizza.</p><p>After dinner and a movie, Luke suggests stargazing and I wholeheartedly agree. He rolls up the windows, since the night air is growing chilly, and we lie together under the blanket Luke thought to bring, staring up through the moonroof to the universe above.</p><p>\u201cWe should talk about it,\u201d Luke says, face to the stars.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d I ask, but I think I know what he\u2019s referring to.</p><p>\u201cAbout you suggesting we break up.\u201d</p><p>I scoot closer to him, if that\u2019s possible.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I want to break up, I just said that it might be better. For you. It might change the future so that you don\u2019t get killed.\u201d I say the words without conviction.</p><p>\u201cBeing without you would never be better for me,\u201d Luke says, facing me. His tone is serious. \u201cDo you understand that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, because I do. Maybe I\u2019m selfish, but I give in a little too easily. I don\u2019t really want to let him go. Maybe deep down I have more faith in my ability to change things than I\u2019m willing to admit.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s forget all about it,\u201d Luke says as he grabs my hand.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d I whisper, kissing him lightly on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cSo did you remember this night already?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cProbably, but I guess I didn\u2019t want to spoil it,\u201d I say truthfully. \u201cI didn\u2019t include it in my notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you remember the summer?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d he teases.</p><p>\u201cPoor baby!\u201d I say. \u201cBut you have things that I don\u2019t. You remember when we met; I\u2019ll never know what that felt like.\u201d</p><p>Luke turns and kisses me gently and then a little more forcefully before we settle back to look at the stars. I snuggle close to the boy I don\u2019t ever want to lose, hoping that somehow I\u2019ll save him.</p><p>The memory of his death is still there, but so is hope. Right now, in Luke\u2019s arms, I feel confident and capable. I will save this boy. I will know the man.</p><p>Luke and I stay nestled together until he nudges me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better get going,\u201d he says gently. I guess I dozed off. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you fall asleep without a note again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I ask, stretching. I kiss him on the cheek and add, with a sly smile, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry, Luke. I\u2019ll remember you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>48</p><p>6/15 (Wed.)</p><p>Outfit:</p><p>\u2014Navy shorts and spotty tank</p><p>\u2014Red two-piece</p><p>\u2014White flip-flops (lost one at the lake)</p><p>IMPORTANT:</p><p>Police found Jonas\u2019s kidnappers (they are \u201ccooperating,\u201d whatever that means).

Didn\u2019t work, but there\u2019s something there... not sure what it is. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Other stuff:</p><p>\u2014Spent all day with Luke... floated on inner tubes at the lake.

How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just fine, Pumpkin. What\u2019s new with you?\u201d</p><p>He does that, I\u2019ve noticed: diverts the conversation to me. He doesn\u2019t talk about himself; not yet, at least.</p><p>But he will.</p><p>I rub my fingers over the delicate beetle brooch that was my grandmother\u2019s. A note from last week said that it arrived in the mail shortly after our last phone call.

Enjoying the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Pumpkin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d he says quickly, as if fathers can\u2019t be upset. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that my note today said Mom called you... about Jonas\u2019s kidnappers.\u201d I feel funny talking about Mom; I know by the way Dad will look at her at my graduation that he still loves her deeply.</p> <p>\u201cYour note said that, huh?\u201d Dad asks with a strange tone to his voice. My condition is still weird for him. He hasn\u2019t lived with it for all these years.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cAnyway, I was just wondering how you\u2019re feeling about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019m feeling a mixture of things, London,\u201d he begins. \u201cProbably like you and your mom are.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m silent, so he continues.</p><p>\u201cYour mother said that the kidnappers are giving out names and addresses of the people who bought the babies, so that\u2019s encouraging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they haven\u2019t heard anything about Jonas specifically?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dad answers, adding, \u201cyour note didn\u2019t tell you that part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019d say that the way I\u2019m feeling is both heavy and hopeful,\u201d my dad says, which is exactly how I\u2019d describe my own emotions right now. \u201cI don\u2019t know, London. Most bad things in life take a while to sort out, but eventually they get sorted. Believing that there will be resolution to all of this has helped get me through some pretty rough years.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what to say; we\u2019re both quiet for a few moments. Then I switch it up.</p><p>\u201cTell me something about him,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>\u201cAbout Jonas?\u201d Dad asks, as if he doesn\u2019t know who I\u2019m talking about.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say patiently. \u201cJust something nice. Something I might not know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Dad says as he pages through his functional memory. \u201cHe loved sweet potatoes?\u201d</p><p>I laugh and Dad laughs and it feels almost normal for a moment.</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d I say through giggles. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe always chewed on your mother\u2019s cell phone.... No wait, I\u2019ve got a good one! Jonas loved bouncy balls. He\u2019d waddle through the house, collecting any ball he could find, whether it was a real one or just something like an orange that looked like a ball. He\u2019d say, \u2018ba, ba,\u2019 and point to whatever round object he wanted until someone gave it to him.</p><p>\u201cAt Christmas your mom decorated the tree a few weeks before the big day. It was when he was about a year and a half. He was so good; he didn\u2019t touch the ornaments, despite the fact that most of them were round.</p><p>\u201cFinally comes Christmas morning, we\u2019re handing out gifts from under the tree, and I think Jonas thought, \u2018Oh, so this is the day we get to touch them!\u2019 He toddled on over and grabbed as many ornaments as he could, then proceeded to try to bounce them on the hardwood floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey broke?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Dad says with a chuckle. \u201cThey were your mother\u2019s vintage ornaments. They shattered into little pieces all over the floor. Jonas loved the noise but was a bit more careful around bouncy balls after that.</p><p>\u201cAnyway...\u201d Dad says, his voice trailing off.</p><p>\u201cGood story, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he replies, sounding nostalgic. \u201cMaybe we\u2019d better cut this short today. I\u2019ve got some work to do outside and I don\u2019t want to keep you from that boyfriend of yours. What\u2019s his name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I say, knowing that he\u2019ll start remembering Luke\u2019s name soon.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Dad replies. I have a feeling that the story about Jonas made him sad, and that he doesn\u2019t much feel like talking anymore. And that\u2019s okay.</p><p>I understand, because more than he could know, I understand him. It\u2019s all there, in this delightfully warped brain of mine. It\u2019s all there before he says it. It\u2019s all there before he does it.</p><p>I adore my father, and that adoration is based mostly on the relationship I know we\u2019ll have eventually. Because of that, cutting one call short doesn\u2019t bother me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dad, we can pick this up next time,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSounds good. Same day next week?\u201d</p><p>The corners of my mouth turn up; we\u2019re on our way to better.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad,\u201d I say. \u201cSame day next week.\u201d</p><p>There is silence for a few seconds, and then:</p><p>\u201cI love you, Pumpkin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Dad.\u201d</p><p>In the middle of the night, the memory rips me from a dead sleep. I switch on the lamp and wait for my eyes to adjust, then throw off the covers and run.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I whisper loudly. She doesn\u2019t stir.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I say in a quiet speaking voice. Nothing.</p><p>I move closer and put my hands on her shoulders. I shake her lightly. When that doesn\u2019t work, I shake her harder and raise my voice. \u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>She gasps, shoots upright, and blinks wildly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she shouts. Her gaze moves from me to the door to the far wall to the window and back again.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say, sitting down on the edge of her bed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you. Nothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>She checks the digital clock on her nightstand. \u201cThen why are you waking me up at two in the morning?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I hold up the photo of Jonas.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t exactly what he looks like,\u201d I say as my eyes well up with tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s confused for a blink, and then it\u2019s clear.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d she whispers, asking to be sure.</p><p>\u201cI know because we\u2019ll meet him, Mom,\u201d I say, and as I do, I let myself remember him coming to our house at Christmas. I remember my parents joking about keeping the ornaments away from him, and his warm and wonderful laughter.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right?\u201d my mom asks, in an even lower tone, as if she\u2019s afraid to speak it.</p> <p>I nod my head. \u201cYes,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Mom asks again.

We were squeezed in with hundreds of other kids at the Weezer show (awesome, btw), and without saying a word or touching me or anything, Luke told me that he wanted us to be alone.</p><p>Suddenly, I got emotional thinking about how important the little moments with Luke are. Sure, I can remember many more from the future. But right now, it\u2019s new. Who knows, maybe that was the first time he\u2019s ever looked at me in exactly that way. And in less than two hours, it will be gone forever.</p><p>I was dwelling on that when I got home. I reread all my notes from high school so far, trying to soak up the stuff I forgot. But instead of reminiscing, I realized something major: I\u2019m a lot stronger than I used to be.</p><p>Before this year, my past memory and parts of my forward memory were blocked, probably because of my brother\u2019s death\u2014 at least what we thought was his death\u2014 and Luke\u2019s future death. Not to mention my dad\u2019s part in everything. Then Luke\u2019s presence somehow helped me start to remember. He started a chain reaction that ultimately gave me back my brother and my father, which made my relationship with my mom better, too. In some ways you could say he gave me back myself.</p><p>I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve had some of these thoughts before, but as far as I can tell, I\u2019ve never written them down quite like this. Even though it\u2019s late, I\u2019m doing it now, because I have so much to be thankful for: a mother who loves me; a father who\u2019s in my life again; an amazing best friend; a brother I\u2019ll meet again soon.</p><p>And a gorgeous, supportive boyfriend who helped me realize that being normal is overrated.</p> <p>This note is to remind me of all of my gifts, from the people in my life to the ability that I and I alone seem to have. Because, yes, maybe I\u2019ll always forget the past. But what I need to remember most is this:</p><p>I can also change the future. </p> </body></html>"]
