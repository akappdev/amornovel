Literally.</p><p>By the age of twenty, he\u2019d fractured his left arm twice\u2014once in a schoolboy brawl at Eton, and then again during an army training drill. Cracked ribs ... he\u2019d lost count of those. Fists driving through barroom haze to connect with his face had snapped the cartilage in his nose a few times, leaving him with a craggy profile\u2014one that was not improved by his myriad scars. Since sometime around his thirtieth birthday, the little finger on his right hand just plain refused to bend. And in damp weather like this, his left knee throbbed with memories of marching through the Pyrenees and surviving the Battle of Nivelle unscathed, only to catch a Basque farmer\u2019s hoe to the knee the next morning, when he left camp for a predawn piss.</p><p>That left knee was on fire tonight, sizzling with pain as Rhys trudged through the granite heart of Devonshire, leading his horse down the darkened road. The moisture in the air kept dithering between fog and rain, and the night was thick with its indecision. He couldn\u2019t see but a few feet in front of him, which was why he\u2019d decided to dismount and lead his horse on foot. Between the poor visibility and the surrounding terrain littered with chunks of stone and boot-sucking bogs, the risk of fatal injury was too great.</p> <p>For the horse, that was. Rhys wasn\u2019t in the least concerned for himself. In fact, if he thought this godforsaken moor had any chance of claiming his own life, he\u2019d cheerfully saddle his gelding and charge off into the gloom.</p><p>But it wouldn\u2019t work. It never had. He\u2019d just end up with a lamed or dead horse, another broken rib perhaps, and the same curse that had haunted him since boyhood: unwanted, undeserved, and wholly wasted good luck.</p><p>No matter what misfortune befell him, this or any night, Rhys St. Maur was doomed to survive it.</p><p>The wind\u2019s low moan played his spine like a fiddle string. Behind him, the gelding balked. With a reassuring shush for the beast\u2019s benefit, Rhys marched on, turning up the collar of his coat to keep out the mist.</p><p>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil...</p> <p>He\u2019d been walking through this valley for a long, long time. Trod so far into death\u2019s shadow he\u2019d felt his feet turning to dust in his boots, the breath in his lungs burning acrid as sulfur. A living ghost, that\u2019s what he was. He\u2019d returned from war to a newly inherited barony, and his sole duty now was to haunt the English aristocracy. Hulk awkwardly in the corners of their parties, terrify their delicate young ladies, and cause the gentlemen to rub their temples self-consciously as they tried not to stare at the gnarled scar marring his own.</p><p>As Rhys rounded a sharp curve in the road, a vaguely familiar sight emerged from the gloom. If he\u2019d read his landmarks right, this had to be it. The tiny village of Buckleigh-in-the-Moor. At this distance, just a meager constellation of amber pinpricks against the black night.</p><p>The horse, scenting straw and safety, picked up his pace. Soon the cluster of stone and cob buildings came into focus. It must not be as late as it felt. A fair number of the cottages still showed light through their windows\u2014yellow eyes peering out from beneath thatched-roof hats.</p><p>He halted in the center of the road. Wiping the moisture from his eyes, he squinted in the direction of the old inn. Fourteen years he\u2019d been gone, but the same sign still creaked on its chains above the door. It read, in retouched gilt letters, The Three Hounds. Below the words, the pictured trio of dogs remained at perpetual attention. A burst of coarse laughter rattled one of the inn\u2019s unshuttered windows. Old Maddox was still doing a brisk trade, then.</p><p>Though his mount stamped with impatience, Rhys stood motionless facing the inn. Finally, he tilted his face to the sky above it. Fog covered the village like cotton wool, obscuring the craggy tors that loomed high on the steep slope beyond. Without their ominous shadow, the village of Buckleigh-in-the-Moor\u2014this hated place he\u2019d been running from since before he could remember\u2014almost appeared ... quaint. Charming. Welcoming.</p><p>And at that fool notion, Rhys almost laughed aloud.</p> <p>This place would not welcome him.</p><p>No sooner had he formed the thought, than the inn\u2019s front door swung out on its hinges, tossing a shaft of light and warmth into the courtyard. The dull wave of laughter he\u2019d heard earlier now swelled to a roar of excitement\u2014one punctuated with a crash of breaking glass.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard son of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>Ah, now that was the sort of reception he\u2019d been expecting. But unless the old superstitions were true and some witch had foretold his arrival, Rhys knew the words couldn\u2019t have been meant for him. No one was likely to recognize him at all\u2014he\u2019d been just seventeen years old when he\u2019d been here last.</p><p>Pulled forward by curiosity and the smells of ale and peat smoke, he approached the open door, stopping just outside.</p><p>The tavern was cramped, and much as Rhys remembered it. Just big enough to hold a small bar, a half-dozen tables, a mismatched assortment of chairs and stools, and\u2014on this particular occasion\u2014complete pandemonium.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! Pound \u2019im good!\u201d</p><p>Two neckless apes faced off in the center of the room, spitting and circling one another as the onlookers pushed aside tables and chairs. The taller of the two brutes took a clumsy swing that caught nothing but air. The momentum carried him into a startled onlooker\u2019s arms. That man took exception and shoved back. Within seconds, the room was a blur of fists.</p> <p>Standing unnoticed in the shadowed doorway, Rhys shifted his weight. An echo of bloodlust whispered in his ear. As a younger man, he would have hurled himself into the thickest knot of violence, eager to claw and punch his way back out. Just to feel the surge of his racing pulse, the slice of broken glass scoring his flesh, the tang of blood in his mouth. The strange, fleeting sensation of being alive.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t that young man anymore. Thanks to the war, he\u2019d had his fill of both fighting and pain. And he\u2019d long given up on feeling alive.</p><p>After a minute or two, the peripheral scrabbling defused. Once again the two louts faced off, huffing for breath and clearly hungry for more. They chuckled as they circled one another, as though this were their typical Saturday night fun. It probably was. Wasn\u2019t as though life on the moor offered a wealth of amusements other than drinking and brawling.</p><p>Now that he studied their faces, Rhys wondered if the two might be brothers. Or cousins, perhaps. The taller one had mashed features, while the shorter sported a beaky nose. But their eyes reflected the same empty shade of blue, and they wore identical expressions of willful stupidity.</p><p>The shorter one picked up a low stool and taunted his opponent with it, as if baiting a bull. The \u201cbull\u201d charged. He threw a wild punch over the stool, but his reach fell short by inches. To close the gap, Bull grabbed a brass candlestick from the mantel and whipped it through the air, sucking all sound from the room.</p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>Beak threw aside his stool, and it smashed to splinters against the hearth. With Bull\u2019s attention momentarily diverted, Beak dove for a table still set for a meal. Half-empty dishes and bread crusts were strewn over white linen.</p><p>Rhys frowned. When had old Maddox started bothering with tablecloths?</p><p>He stopped wondering about it when Beak came up wielding a knife.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you to raise a club to me, you whoreson,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Everyone in the room froze. Rhys ceased leaning against the doorjamb and stood erect, reconsidering his decision not to intervene. With a brass club and a knife involved, someone was likely to get seriously injured, or worse. As tired as he might be of fighting, he was even more weary of watching men die.</p><p>But before he could act, a series of sounds arrested him where he stood.</p><p>Crash. A bottle breaking.</p><p>Plink, plink, plink. Glass bits trickling to the floor.</p><p>Thud. Beak collapsing to the table unconscious, rivulets of wine streaming down around his ears.</p><p>\u201cHarold Symmonds, you\u2019ll pay for that wine.\u201d A slender, dark-haired woman stood over Beak\u2019s senseless form, clutching what remained of a green-glass bottle. \u201cAnd the tablecloth too, you great lout.\u201d She shook her head and tsked. \u201cBlood and claret will never come out of white linen.</p><p>\u201cAnd as for you, Laurence\u2014\u201d She wheeled on the second man, threatening him with the broken bottle\u2019s sharp glass teeth. Though he was twice as big as the barmaid and a man besides, Laurence held up his hands in surrender.</p><p>In fact, every man in the room had gone still. As though they all feared the harsh discipline this tiny barmaid might dole out. Interesting. To a man like Rhys, who\u2019d spent several years commanding soldiers, that snap to attention spoke volumes.</p><p>Jabbing the bottle at Laurence, the barmaid backed him up against the wall. \u201c\u2019Twas your own master who brought that, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d He stared at the candlestick in his fist. \u201cIt\u2019s Gideon\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the inn\u2019s.\u201d She wrenched the brass club away from the stunned brute and curled her arm, lifting it to eye level. \u201cBut Gideon delivered it. Hauled it and its mate all the way up from Plymouth just last week. The set came very dear, and I\u2019ll thank you to keep your grimy mitts off the bric-a-brac.\u201d</p><p>The thing must have weighed a stone, but it cost her no effort to heft the candlestick up on the mantel with one hand and nudge it back into place.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she said to herself, apparently satisfied with the symmetry. Standing back, she threw the jagged remnants of the bottle into the fire, and a wine-fueled blaze surged in the hearth.</p><p>The reddish flare illuminated the woman\u2019s face, and Rhys got his first good look at her.</p><p>Holy God. She was beautiful.</p><p>And young.</p><p>And ... and beautiful.</p><p>Rhys had never been especially good with words. He couldn\u2019t have described exactly what it was about this woman that made her appearance so striking. He just knew he\u2019d been struck.</p><p>She had pale skin and dark hair coming loose from a thick plait. Her figure was slight, yet feminine. Her eyes were large and wide, but to discern their color he would\u2019ve had to stand much closer to her.</p><p>He wanted to stand much closer to her.</p><p>Especially now that she was no longer armed.</p><p>Fury radiated from her slender form as she propped her hands on her hips and scolded the assembly. \u201cIt\u2019s the same damned scene, again and again.\u201d Her tone was sharp, but the voice beneath it was husky, warm. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, this inn is all we\u2019ve got in Buckleigh-in-the-Moor. I\u2019m trying to build a name for this place, make it a respectable establishment for travelers. Now tell me, how am I to make this inn fit for the Quality, what with you overgrown clods destroying my dining room once a fortnight?\u201d</p><p>She swept an angry glare around the room, silently confronting each offender in turn. When her gaze collided with Rhys\u2019s, he noted the first crack in her veneer of poise. Her eyelashes fluttered. That was the extent of her visible surprise. The rest of her remained granite-still as she said, \u201cAnd all this in front of a guest.\u201d</p><p>Rhys sensed every head in the room swiveling to face him. But he couldn\u2019t have torn his gaze from the barmaid\u2019s if he\u2019d tried. Jesus, what a woman.</p><p>Between the travel and the damp, his body had been grousing at him all night. He wouldn\u2019t have believed one more part of him could stiffen ... but evidently it could. His riding breeches pulled snug across his groin. He\u2019d gone hard enough to rival that brass candlestick. He hadn\u2019t reacted so intensely to a woman since he\u2019d been a randy youth. Perhaps not even then. His heart pounded. Blood surged through his veins, carrying orders to his every limb. He felt his whole body tightening, mustering strength, readying for a purpose. A very specific, very pleasurable purpose.</p><p>Damn. He felt alive.</p><p>Still holding his gaze, she said steadily, \u201cNow put this place to rights.\u201d</p><p>Rhys blinked. He didn\u2019t recall this woman\u2014he couldn\u2019t possibly have forgotten her\u2014but had she somehow recognized him? Was she calling him out for his gross negligence as lord? It would be a fair enough accusation. If there was anything that needed putting to rights in Buckleigh-in-the-Moor, the responsibility should be his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But as the men before him lurched into motion, scraping chairs and tables against the slate floor as they dragged the furniture back into place, Rhys realized her words hadn\u2019t been meant for him. He was almost disappointed. He would have liked to put things to rights for her. Starting with that mussed dark hair.</p><p>With an impatient sweep of her fingers, she tucked a lock behind her ear. \u201cWelcome to the Three Hounds,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you coming in, or aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, he was coming in. He was most definitely coming in.</p> <p>Rhys stepped forward and closed the door behind him.</p><p>Before he could acknowledge her welcome, the barmaid\u2019s attention jerked away. \u201cNot there, Skinner. Left side of the hearth.\u201d</p><p>Skinner hurried to obey. All six burly feet of him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a horse outside,\u201d Rhys said, once he had her attention again.</p><p>She nodded and summoned a twiggy youth from the bar. \u201cDarryl, see to the gentleman\u2019s horse.\u201d To Rhys she said, \u201cWill you drink whiskey, sir?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust ale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve rabbit stew and mutton pie.\u201d</p><p>His stomach rumbled. \u201cI\u2019d welcome both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a seat, then.\u201d</p><p>Rhys crossed to a table, lowered his weight onto the most sturdy-looking of the chairs, and accepted a tankard of ale from her hand.</p><p>He sipped at the cool ale, watching the barmaid and her band of reformed pugilists clear the room of debris. No wonder this place still did a brisk business. To Rhys\u2019s recollection, old Maddox had never kept barmaids this fair, nor this fierce.</p> <p>She kept stealing looks at him, even as she swept broken glass from the floor and rolled up the soiled linen tablecloth. There was an intriguing softness to her gaze.</p><p>That couldn\u2019t be right. Perhaps she was looking at someone else. Under the guise of stretching, Rhys rotated his neck and turned an unhurried glance about the room.</p><p>No. There was no one else.</p><p>Strange.</p><p>Everything about the woman\u2014her bearing, her voice, the reactions she inspired\u2014declared her strength. But her eyes were telling him something else. They spoke of hopes and fears and vulnerability, and Rhys had no idea why she\u2019d be revealing all that to a complete stranger, least of all him\u2014but he knew one thing. Those looks she kept giving him contained more direct human contact than he\u2019d known in years.</p><p>She was touching him. From across the room, with her hands otherwise occupied, she was touching him. He felt it deep inside.</p><p>Rhys sipped his ale and pondered the queer nature of fate. He was a steadfast believer in destiny. There was no other way to explain the fact that his heart still beat. In his eleven years in the light infantry, he\u2019d spent battle after battle charging headlong into the bloody fray, eager to meet his death. Only to be cruelly disappointed, when fate spared him once again. He simply could not die. But for once, maybe for once his wretched good luck was about to throw him a true boon.</p><p>As she bent to sweep splintered wood from the corner, he observed the gentle curve of her neck, the loose strands of hair at her nape. He could spend a very pleasant minute winding that lock of hair about his finger, counting how many times it would wrap around. Five, he guessed, or maybe six.</p> <p>When she straightened and their eyes met again, he raised his ale in a silent salute. She smiled shyly before looking away. Odd, because she didn\u2019t seem the shy type.</p><p>As if to prove the point, she called across the room, \u201cLaurence, get Harry back in the nook where he belongs. He\u2019s bleeding on my flagstones, and I just scrubbed them yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Meredith.\u201d</p><p>Meredith. The name pulled a thread in his mind, but the memory unraveled before Rhys could grasp it.</p><p>Laurence slid an arm under the moaning heap that was Harry Symmonds and shouldered the unconscious man to his feet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018Meredith\u2019 me.\u201d She shooed them toward a secluded alcove with her broom. \u201cSo long as you\u2019re going to behave like boys, it\u2019ll be Mrs. Maddox to you.\u201d</p><p>The ale soured on Rhys\u2019s tongue. Mrs. Maddox?</p><p>Ah, hell. This young, strong, beautiful woman was married to old Maddox? Not a barmaid after all, but the inn\u2019s landlady. So much for fate throwing him a boon. He should have known better. There\u2019d be nothing so beautiful for him on this earth.</p><p>A trencher of stew and a wedge of mutton pie appeared on the table before him. Rhys dug in, keeping his gaze stubbornly trained on the food rather than his lovely server. He didn\u2019t pursue married women, no matter what sort of looks they threw him. Not to mention, if she was married to Maddox and making eyes at Rhys, the woman must be not only fickle, but daft and half-blind in the bargain.</p><p>He was hungrier than he\u2019d realized, and he cleaned both plates in a matter of minutes. He\u2019d always been a fast, efficient eater, even more so since the army. More than once in the year since he\u2019d inherited the Ashworth title, he\u2019d looked up from a finely laid London dinner table to discover his table manners the object of intense, horrified scrutiny. Just another of his acquired traits that sent English ladies groping for their vinaigrettes.</p><p>He bolted the rest of his ale and carried the empty tankard to the bar for refilling. Mrs. Maddox had disappeared for the moment, and a gap-toothed young man stood behind the counter. Rhys recognized him as the youth she\u2019d charged with stabling his horse. What was his name again? Dylan? Dermott?</p><p>\u201cDarryl Tewkes, at your service, sir. Will it be another ale?\u201d</p><p>The young man took the tankard from Rhys, and his left eye creased at the edge as he did it. Rhys couldn\u2019t tell if it was a wink or some sort of nervous twitch. The latter, he hoped, when the eye flashed shut a second time. He had an amusing look to him, this Darryl Tewkes. Sharp nose, pointy ears. Like one of the piskies old moorfolk still believed in.</p><p>\u201cYours is a fine horse, sir,\u201d Darryl went on, handing him a mug of fresh ale. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him settled in well. He\u2019s unsaddled, watered. I\u2019ll go back out to brush him down and give him hay in a minute or two.\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded his approval and raised his drink.</p><p>\u201cDoes he have a name, sir? The horse?\u201d</p><p>He wiped his mouth with his cuff. \u201cNo.\u201d He never named them, not anymore.</p><p>\u201cWill the gentleman be staying long in the neighborhood?\u201d Darryl asked.</p><p>\u201cJust one night.\u201d</p><p>At the outset, Rhys hadn\u2019t been sure how long he\u2019d stay. But now he knew\u2014one night of this place was all he could take. In the morning, he\u2019d ride up the slope and take a long, slow look at what he\u2019d come to see. And then he\u2019d leave. Surely he could hire a steward or land agent to come tend to any matters here that needed attention. That was what titled gentlemen of means did, wasn\u2019t it? Where he\u2019d go after that, Rhys had no idea. Wherever fate took him, he supposed.</p><p>\u201cOne night?\u201d Darryl\u2019s eye gave an eager twitch. \u201cSir, you must stay more than one night. One night isn\u2019t anywhere long enough to see the local attractions.\u201d</p><p>Rhys frowned. Attractions? There were local attractions?</p><p>The younger man\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cI give tours to travelers,\u201d he said, his face brightening. \u201cTwo hours, or half a day. Best value for your coin is my full-day Mystic Moor excursion, complete with guided commentary and a picnic lunch.\u201d</p><p>Rhys chuckled at the image of genteel travelers picnicking in the shadow of Bell Tor. He hoped they took precautions against the ravens. He cleared his throat and asked, \u201cWhat sort of attractions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, it\u2019s a mystical trip through time, you see.\u201d He made a grand, expansive gesture. \u201cI\u2019ll start by taking you round to the ancient burial cairns, and the abandoned tinners\u2019 works from centuries past.\u201d</p><p>Rhys was well familiar with those sights. They looked remarkably like random piles of stone.</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s the old monks\u2019 crosses. And Bell Tor, of course. On a clear day, you can see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven more rocks?\u201d Rhys grunted, still unimpressed.</p><p>\u201cOh, but that\u2019s nothing. I haven\u2019t yet told you the best part of the tour. The haunted ruins of Nethermoor Hall.\u201d</p><p>Now he had Rhys\u2019s attention. \u201cHaunted ruins, you say?\u201d</p><p>Darryl settled both elbows on the counter and leaned forward, as though he didn\u2019t dare speak too loud. \u201cYes. Nethermoor Hall. The cursed House of Ashworth. Generations of evil flourished in that house. Till one summer night fourteen years ago, when it burnt to the ground in an unholy conflagration. My tour ends there, just as the hour turns toward dusk. Sometimes, if you listen sharp, you can hear the crackle of flames, or catch a whiff of brimstone on the wind. That blaze was the judgment of God, folk say. After that night, the family was never heard from again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d Rhys asked, surprised to hear the question come from his lips. He had to credit the younger man. Darryl did have a knack for spinning tales. \u201cI mean, you spoke of haunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes. Well, the old Lord Ashworth\u2019s ghost hasn\u2019t been seen. He never returned to Devonshire. Died just last year, somewhere in Ireland, I think. Lady Ashworth, she died several years before the blaze. There are some folk here\u2014the ones with the touch\u2014who\u2019ve seen her ghostly form hovering high above the ruined house. As though she\u2019s still pacing the upstairs corridors. But it\u2019s the son people see most often.\u201d</p><p>Rhys choked on a mouthful of ale. \u201cThe son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. He was a wild youth, always making trouble. Churned up the moor with his reckless rides. Folk say he had bit of devil in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he died in this fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot precisely. He nearly perished\u2014should have died, by accounts. But even though he survived, it\u2019s like he left a ghostly imprint on Nethermoor Hall. People spy his phantom wandering the place, especially on warm summer nights. They\u2019ve even seen him gallop across the moor on a spectral horse, flames licking at his heels.\u201d</p><p>Rhys blinked at the youth, unsure whether to be amused, bemused, offended, or ... mildly concerned. Outlandish as Darryl\u2019s tale might be, parts of it held the faint ring of truth. All these years he\u2019d spent feeling half alive, could it be because he\u2019d left some ghost of his adolescent self behind? He shook his head to dispel the fool notion. This Dartmoor fog must be creeping in through his ears, muddling his brain.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Darryl leaned forward and waggled his eyebrows. \u201cThe tour. Are you man enough? Do you dare risk an encounter with Rhys St. Maur, the living phantom of Bell Tor?\u201d</p><p>A smile tugged at Rhys\u2019s lips. Now this could prove amusing. Before he could decide just how to respond, a figure joined Darryl\u2019s on the business side of the bar.</p><p>Meredith.</p><p>Mrs. Maddox, he corrected himself.</p><p>\u201cDarryl,\u201d she said, clouting the youth on the back of the head, \u201cyou idiot. This is Rhys St. Maur. Lord Ashworth now. You\u2019re talking to your \u2018living phantom,\u2019 live and in the flesh.\u201d</p><p>Darryl\u2019s pale face went whiter still as he stared at Rhys, jaw working to no audible effect. At least his eye had finally ceased twitching.</p><p>The youth swallowed hard as Rhys braced his arm on the bar and leaned forward. Until their faces were just inches apart. And then, when he was certain Darryl was paying very close attention, he lowered his voice and whispered ...</p><p>\u201cBoo.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cI ... You\u2019re ...\u201d Darryl stammered. \u201cI mean to say, it isn\u2019t ...\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll see to him, Darryl.\u201d With a tone that would brook no argument, Meredith shooed the addlewit groom from the bar. \u201cBack to the stables you go.\u201d</p><p>Rhys was staring at her. To avoid staring back, Meredith quickly looked away, making a show of straightening bottles. So far, she\u2019d made do with furtive glances, but she\u2019d gaze at him all night long if she could, exploring his every contour and shadow. Cataloging all the ways he\u2019d changed and all the ways he hadn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hair was the first thing she\u2019d noticed. Or rather, the lack of it. He kept it shorn close to his scalp now, and that had thrown her for a moment when she\u2019d seen him in the door. All her memories of Rhys featured long waves of dark hair pulled back with a bit of leather cord. Or falling loose in roguish locks over his brow. He\u2019d tried to hide his face sometimes back then\u2014the new bruise purpling beneath his eye, or a fresh split in his lip.</p><p>He seemed to have given up on hiding his injuries now. His face was a map of scars she didn\u2019t recognize, but she blessed those healed wounds. They told her she wasn\u2019t dreaming this time. This was truly Rhys St. Maur sitting there on the stool, one elbow propped on the counter. Huge and defiant and rugged and\u2014holy God\u2014right there in front of her. In the flesh. After fourteen years.</p><p>\u201cI know you,\u201d he said slowly. His tone made it a question.</p> <p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Desperate to disguise her shock, Meredith reached for his empty tankard.</p><p>His fingers tightened over the handle. Large, roughened. Strong.</p><p>Her gaze snapped up to his, and again he snared her with those gorgeous eyes. In all the years she\u2019d spent living on the Nethermoor estate, Rhys St. Maur had never looked at her like this. He\u2019d scarcely looked at her at all. Now she could see that his eyes were wild and beautiful, just like the rest of him. Deep, rich brown streaked with amber. Like the finest cognac, or ...</p><p>\u201cBrandy,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>His brow lifted. A thick scar split it in two.</p> <p>\u201cCare for a brandy?\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cCool night out there. A man needs something more than ale to warm him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he?\u201d His lips quirked in a sensuous way.</p><p>She cursed silently, realizing the flirtatious implication of her words. That hadn\u2019t been her intent. Not that she found it repulsive, the idea of ... warming Rhys St. Maur. To the contrary, fantasies of doing just that had steamed her bathwater for years. \u201cI ... I only meant ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Thank you, Mrs. Maddox. But I don\u2019t drink spirits.\u201d</p><p>Well. He might not need a drink, but Meredith did. She reached for a bottle under the counter\u2014her private reserve\u2014and poured herself a generous amount.</p><p>\u201cI know you,\u201d he said. Not a question this time. His voice was deeper than she recalled, and it reached different places inside her. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you, but I know you.\u201d</p> <p>She tilted the glass of gin slowly, taking a fortifying swallow before answering. \u201cMeredith Lane,\u201d she finally said, giving him her maiden name. \u201cYou likely don\u2019t recall, but my father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cManaged our stables. Of course I recall.\u201d He cocked his head and narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re George Lane\u2019s girl? Impossible. When I saw that girl last, she was nothing but freckles and bone.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks heated. He did remember her. Not precisely the way she\u2019d have wished to be remembered, but it was something.</p><p>\u201cMerry Lane,\u201d he said, his voice gone soft. A low chuckle caught in his throat. \u201cCan\u2019t believe it. You\u2019re little Merry Lane.\u201d</p><p>The warmth in her cheeks was a full blush now. That was the only notice he\u2019d taken of her as a girl\u2014her silly, sentimental name. If they crossed paths in the stables, he\u2019d say it with a mocking lilt in his voice as he impatiently brushed her aside.</p><p>Run along home, Merry Lane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Merry Lane anymore.\u201d Wiping down the counter with a rag, she kept her tone light. \u201cThat\u2019s the magic of being gone from the neighborhood fourteen years, my lord. Things change in your absence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they do, Mrs. Maddox. So they do.\u201d Suddenly serious, he cleared his throat. \u201cYour father ... He\u2019s still living?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUpstairs as we speak. He oversees the inn\u2019s stables now, with Darryl\u2019s help. Though we seldom shelter anything finer than pack ponies and the occasional traveler\u2019s mount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to wait. He\u2019ll be sleeping now, but tomorrow you can ...\u201d She paused. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you mean to stay the night here. It is the only inn for miles.\u201d</p><p>Please stay, a fool voice inside her pleaded. Please don\u2019t walk away again just yet.</p><p>\u201cYes, for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the one night?\u201d Not that it mattered. Whether he stayed one night or ten, he was sure to leave again eventually. There was nothing for him here. His inherited lands were largely worthless moorland. Nethermoor Hall itself was a burnt-out ruin, and it ought to stay that way.</p><p>\u201cJust the one night.\u201d He gave her a slight, self-effacing smile. \u201cIf you\u2019ve a room for a living phantom, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind Darryl Tewkes,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cHe\u2019s been embroidering that tale for years. He plies it on all the travelers passing through, trying to entice them to stay in the neighborhood an extra night. More money for the inn, you know, as well as for his pocket. He even has some of the cottagers along the touring route making souvenirs to sell. Miniature stone crosses and the like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow enterprising of him. An industrious employee, a capable young wife ... Old Maddox seems to have done quite well for himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man\u2019s six years in the grave. Depends on your point of view, whether that\u2019s doing well or not.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tensed. \u201cYou\u2019re widowed.\u201d</p><p>She nodded in reply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d She fumbled with the glass she\u2019d been wiping clean. Devil take it, she was a widow, an innkeeper, and turning thirty in two summers. How did he make her feel like an awkward girl again? \u201cI mean, it\u2019s been years. I\u2019ve been widowed longer than I was married, by now. And he left me the inn, so we get by well enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe? Have you children?\u201d</p><p>The familiar pang came and ebbed in a heartbeat. She shook her head. \u201cNo. Just me and Father. And Darryl, since his aunt died. And all the villagers, for that matter. We had to find a way to get by, didn\u2019t we? The primary local employer deserted us fourteen years ago.\u201d</p><p>Rhys stared at his ale a moment. Then he lifted it and drank in silence.</p><p>He looked chastened, and she rued the bitterness in her tone. But he should know the truth\u2014it hadn\u2019t been easy. The late Lord Ashworth had been a right bastard, but at least he\u2019d paid wages on occasion and given the local merchants some custom. After Nethermoor burned down and the family deserted the region, the village was left at loose ends. There was very little agriculture in the area, this being the rocky heart of the moor. Buckleigh-in-the-Moor lost an entire generation as the young men left town, one by one. The new war prison at Princetown gave some work for a time. Others went further, to Exeter or Plymouth. Those few who remained in the village relied on what wages the Three Hounds could provide\u2014as Darryl did\u2014or else made a living through shady dealings.</p><p>Speaking of shady dealings ... As if she\u2019d called him in from the cold with the thought, Gideon Myles strolled through the door.</p><p>The assembled men greeted him with a rousing cheer, to which Gideon responded with a gallant tip of his low-brimmed cap. As always, he took a moment to savor his notoriety, vigorously shaking the outstretched hands of several men. All too soon, however, his keen eyes sought her out. Meredith knew better than to wait for him to approach.</p><p>\u201cBack in a trice,\u201d she told Rhys, hurrying out from behind the bar. Rhys was only passing through, just staying the night. He and Gideon Myles had no business with one another, but only trouble could result if they met.</p><p>Gideon greeted her with a roguish grin. He was a young man\u2014at least three years her junior\u2014but he\u2019d never lacked for arrogance. He was also far too handsome for his own good. \u201cWell, well,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you look eager to see me? And for good reason, too. I\u2019ve a cask of Madeira for you this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d she said distractedly, darting a glance at Rhys. \u201cCan we go outside and discuss it in the courtyard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe courtyard? I just came in. It\u2019s cold as a witch\u2019s cunny out there, and near as damp.\u201d His eyebrow arched, and he lowered his voice to a suggestive murmur. \u201cUnless you wanted a bit of privacy, in which case I\u2019d suggest a different location ...\u201d</p><p>She blew out a frustrated breath. Now was not the time for flirtation. Pulling him aside, she said, \u201cYou can\u2019t unload the wagon tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I know the mist\u2019s a bit thick, but by the time the men load up the ponies the weather\u2019s sure to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. You mustn\u2019t load the ponies, either. I mean it, Gideon. Tonight won\u2019t do. You can pull the wagon into the barn, and we\u2019ll cover it with blankets and such. Darryl will sleep atop it, for safekeeping.\u201d</p><p>He made a scornful sound in his throat. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust Darryl Tewkes to guard my drink while I went out to piss.\u201d His eyes went serious. \u201cIt\u2019s a valuable take tonight, Meredith. I\u2019ve two men out there already, armed with pistols and shot. It\u2019s too risky not to transport the goods immediately.\u201d</p><p>Even worse. Two men with guns? She hesitated, casting a glance toward the bar.</p><p>\u201cAs usual,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s more than Madeira in it for you. You know I pay handsomely for the use of your father\u2019s ponies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. But you don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand your eyes keep straying to that gent by the bar. Great ugly fellow, isn\u2019t he? Where\u2019d he come from?\u201d His voice darkened. \u201cHas he frightened you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. He\u2019s just a traveler.\u201d Inspiration struck, and she added, \u201cSo he says. If you ask me, he\u2019s on errand from the Lydford magistrate. Best not to give him any reason to suspect, you know? Wait until morning, after he leaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t transport these goods in daylight. And the Lydford magistrate\u2019s been in my pocket for well over a year.\u201d Gideon shrugged out of his coat and tossed it to a waiting man. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll introduce myself. Add his drinks to my account, will you?\u201d</p><p>Meredith tried to protest, but Gideon was already halfway across the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Gideon Myles,\u201d he announced, tossing his cap on the counter beside Rhys\u2019s elbow.</p><p>Rhys looked up from his ale. \u201cShould I know that name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay you should. But then, modesty\u2019s never been one of my virtues.\u201d</p><p>With a reluctant sigh, Rhys braced his hands on the edge of the bar and stood. Meredith saw a flicker of hesitance cross Gideon\u2019s features. Gideon was a big man by most measures, but Rhys dwarfed him with his shadow alone.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d Rhys said, stacking his arms across his massive chest. \u201cYou want to show me your enchanted cave and sell me a bottle of piskie dust.\u201d</p><p>And now Gideon\u2019s face went blank with confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re implying,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cbut I know I feel like hitting you for it.\u201d</p><p>This was hopeless. Meredith had no choice but to step in.</p><p>\u201cPardon the interruption,\u201d she said to Rhys. \u201cMr. Myles is our local ... dry goods carrier.\u201d She ignored Gideon\u2019s expression of offended pride. He\u2019d understand the reason for her falsehood soon enough. \u201cGideon, this is Rhys St. Maur. The new Lord Ashworth.\u201d</p><p>The entire room went still. Conversations died mid-syllable. The name Ashworth had the same effect as the sound of that brass candlestick whipped through the air. It was a dangerous sound. A threat.</p><p>\u201cAshworth,\u201d Gideon repeated, staring down Rhys with vengeful eyes.</p><p>Rhys stood impassive and said evenly, \u201cYes. I believe we\u2019ve established our names, Mr. Myles.\u201d</p><p>A grumble spread through the room. Chair legs scraped slate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Gideon asked.</p><p>\u201cWhatever I please. I don\u2019t answer to you.\u201d</p><p>Meredith knew she had to draw a close to this scene, and fast. She\u2019d only just tidied up from the first brawl. And now Gideon had two men outside armed with pistols, and a wagonload of smuggled goods he\u2019d no doubt kill to protect.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s only here for the night,\u201d she announced to the room. \u201cAnd I was just going to show him to his accommodations. Mr. Myles, our trade will wait for tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>There, she told Gideon with her eyes. Now do you see why you can\u2019t go unloading that wagon tonight?</p><p>He did. But he wasn\u2019t happy about it. He struck a petulant pose. \u201cDarryl can show him upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my inn. He\u2019s my guest.\u201d She turned to Rhys. \u201cIf you\u2019d follow me, my lord?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for his reply, just turned and headed for the back stairs and hoped he\u2019d follow. He did. The ancient bowed planks groaned beneath his weight, and the stairway suddenly felt too narrow.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to make trouble for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble,\u201d she replied, slowing her pace. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t mind my asking, why are you here?\u201d</p><p>She heard him sigh. \u201cHonestly, Mrs. Maddox?\u201d Creak. \u201cI\u2019m asking myself the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough.</p><p>\u201cYour room\u2019s just here,\u201d she said, leading him down the corridor. She waited to the side, holding the door open for him to enter.</p><p>He strode a few paces to the center of the bedchamber and turned a slow circle, surveying his accommodations. Meredith held her breath, wondering what he\u2019d make of them. She\u2019d only finished redecorating the room this week. It was the opening salvo in her campaign to remake the Three Hounds into a quality establishment. A real inn, the type where well-heeled travelers would plan to break their journeys, not just reluctantly stop over if they\u2019d broken a carriage wheel.</p> <p>Meredith sighed as she went to start a fire. She really hadn\u2019t the slightest notion what she was doing. Just this afternoon, she\u2019d stood in the center of this room, feeling terribly proud of the new ruffled drapes and quilted counterpane. The blue china vase above the mantel added a touch of elegance, she\u2019d fancied.</p><p>Now that she saw the small bedchamber from Rhys\u2019s perspective, she noted the exposed rafters overhead, the dingy walls, the choking tang of peat smoke from the hearth .... It all looked hopelessly meager and drab. She could only imagine how it appeared in a titled gentleman\u2019s eyes. Who was she fooling, anyway?</p><p>\u201cDarryl will bring up your bags. Shall I tell him to act as valet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rhys said quickly. She thought she saw him shudder. \u201cNot necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the washstand in the corner.\u201d Please don\u2019t chip the new porcelain.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe serve breakfast downstairs in the morning. And if there\u2019s anything you need in the meantime, you\u2019ve only to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He tipped his gaze to the ceiling. \u201cThis room is rather ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrafty,\u201d she finished. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll send in Darryl overnight to add peat to the fire, and there\u2019s an extra blanket in the chest. But then you might become overheated, in which case there\u2019s always the window.\u201d She felt, with distinct horror, that she was blathering on like a bedlamite, but she couldn\u2019t seem to stop. \u201cI know the room must be poor indeed, compared with what you\u2019re accustomed to, but I do hope you\u2019ll find it adequate to your ...\u201d</p><p>He turned to her and smiled.</p><p>And suddenly she had no more words.</p><p>\u201cAdequate?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIn the army, I grew more accustomed to sleeping on hard ground than anything. My rooms in London were barren and cold.\u201d He looked around the bedchamber. \u201cI can assure you, this is the finest bedchamber I\u2019ve known in years. True luxury. I\u2019ll sleep well tonight.\u201d</p><p>His words made her heart float in her chest. Blast it. She couldn\u2019t start yearning for him. Well, she\u2019d started yearning for him as a girl, but she couldn\u2019t afford to take the practice up again now. He was leaving in the morning.</p><p>\u201cIn fact,\u201d he said lightly, crossing to the window and peering out, \u201cI\u2019m so pleased with this room, I think I could kiss you for it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord. Now that wouldn\u2019t help with her yearning problem.</p><p>His head jerked up, as though he\u2019d surprised himself with the words. Of course he had. They were a ridiculous notion. The last time he\u2019d looked at her, he\u2019d seen naught but freckles and bone.</p><p>Confirming the foolishness, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s strange.\u201d</p><p>She tried to laugh, but couldn\u2019t. He was drawing too near. Her pulse thundered in her chest as those giant boots carried him across the old, creaking oak floorboards. Floorboards she\u2019d scoured with sand on hand and knee just a few days ago. Her shoulders still ached.</p><p>His deep brown eyes searched hers as he drew to a halt. \u201cI think I\u2019d very much like to kiss you.\u201d He reached out and plucked a stray lock of her hair from where it lay on her shoulder, twisting it slowly between his finger and thumb. \u201cWhat do you say, Merry Lane? Show me a proper welcome home?\u201d</p><p>She could make a joke, or step away. She knew well how to deflect a man\u2019s advances. Down in the tavern, she did it all the time. For each of the few men she\u2019d taken to her bed since her husband\u2019s death, she\u2019d refused dozens more. But she\u2019d spent her girlhood dreaming of this particular man, staring down at her with exactly that glimmer of desire in his eyes, speaking precisely those words to her.</p><p>I think I\u2019d very much like to kiss you.</p><p>It was simply all too much. In a flutter of nerves, she blurted out, \u201cIs there anything else you require, my lord?\u201d</p><p>At her brisk tone, he recoiled instantly. \u201cNo.\u201d He turned away, but not before she caught a wounded flash in his eyes. He rubbed one palm over his short dark hair. \u201cNo, I apologize. That was ... wrong of me. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Meredith stood there for a moment, watching him return to the window.</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn back around as he said, \u201cYou\u2019d best leave me, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>So she slipped out the door and drew it shut behind her. Then she punched the doorjamb with a low growl.</p><p>Damn, damn, damn. In all her life, she\u2019d never been so frustrated with herself. She\u2019d just let slip the opportunity\u2014the one single chance she\u2019d ever have\u2014to share a kiss, and most likely a bed, with the man she\u2019d wanted since she\u2019d scarcely understood what wanting meant. Not only that, but she\u2019d given him the wrong impression with her refusal. Now he thought she found him unattractive and unkissable, when nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>Gideon was still downstairs in the bar. She needed to see his wagonload of goods stowed safely in the horse barn. Not to mention, finish serving her customers without losing more furniture in the process.</p><p>But Rhys would leave tomorrow. She would never have this chance again. She worked so hard for this place. Every day, all day. Didn\u2019t she deserve one night for herself?</p><p>She rapped firmly on the door.</p><p>When he opened it, she spoke quickly, before she could lose her nerve. \u201cYou could,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could kiss me. I wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her jaw in his hand and tilted her face to his. It was only then that she realized she\u2019d addressed her fearless speech to his coat button.</p><p>His thumb stroked her cheek tenderly, and she let her eyes close. He did it again, dragging his thumb from her cheekbone to her jaw. Just that gentle brush of his skin against hers had her whole body humming.</p><p>Unable to bear the anticipation a moment longer, she opened her eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t kiss her.</p><p>\u201cThank you for that.\u201d He touched a fingertip to the corner of her mouth before releasing her. \u201cGood night, Mrs. Maddox.\u201d</p><p>Before she could bid him the same, he\u2019d closed the door.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>If only stone could burn. In the thin gray dawn, Rhys stood before the gutted shell of Nethermoor Hall. After such a long absence, he hadn\u2019t known what to expect. He\u2019d fantasized about finding the place just a scar on the moor, a still-smoking pile of cinders and lime. But those hopes had been disappointed. For unlike the roofbeams, floors, and passageways, Nethermoor\u2019s exterior walls had been built of stone. And damn it all, stone didn\u2019t burn.</p><p>Much of the once-great house\u2019s masonry had disappeared into the Dartmoor mist, no doubt scavenged for new construction. But here and there, an orderly stack of stones persisted\u2014the corner of a room, an arched doorway leading from one nowhere to another. Fourteen unforgiving winters had scrubbed the remaining rocks of soot, and they appeared as weathered and permanent as so many granite tors pressing up through the moor\u2019s endless swaths of gorse.</p><p>Time and rain could do their worst for centuries. A conflagration could consume the surrounding heath. But Nethermoor Hall would never completely go away, because it was made of stone, and stones were forever.</p><p>Turning away from the house, Rhys walked the short distance to where the stables had once stood. Where the fire had begun. Little remained to mark the site, save a low border of rocks outlining the foundation. The place had grown over with moss and sedge. He kicked at a blackened piece of metal on the ground. An old bridle loop, perhaps. Or maybe a bit. An icy shiver crawled over his neck.</p><p>Behind him, his gelding whickered uneasily. The horse didn\u2019t like the place any more than he did. Maybe he should have given more credit to Darryl\u2019s tales. Maybe the scent of singed horseflesh did linger on the breeze. Did the perk of the horse\u2019s ears mean he caught the faint echoes of equine screams?</p><p>Rhys shuddered. In the years since leaving Nethermoor, he\u2019d heard the death cries of many creatures, human and inhuman. But none were as eerie or chilling as the sounds this place had etched on his memory\u2014the crisp, rhythmic crack of a whip kissing hide, the whoosh of a wind-fueled blaze, and those panicked screams of trapped horses.</p><p>Darryl Tewkes was right. Rhys should have died with those beasts fourteen years ago. He\u2019d been courting death every day of his life ever since. But he was the human equivalent of a goddamned boulder. Huge, hard, indestructible. He\u2019d weathered the daily beatings in his youth, the countless schoolyard and tavern brawls, the ravages of battle. He was starker, meaner, and scarred for his pains, but still here.</p><p>Still here. Standing in front of this hellish pile of rocks and misery he\u2019d inherited.</p><p>If only stone could burn.</p><p>A bitter taste filled his mouth. He turned his head, intending to spit, but found himself doubled over and retching instead. God damn it. Eleven years in the infantry, and he\u2019d never once vomited in battle.</p><p>Get up, the voice inside him said. The cold, commanding voice he\u2019d never been able to silence, even with a hundred cannons thundering in his ears. Get up. No matter what struck him down\u2014fist, shot, bayonet\u2014he somehow always staggered to his feet, ready to take more. Get up. On your feet. Stand, you miserable piece of filth.</p><p>Rhys stood.</p><p>Slowly turned.</p><p>And left, without looking back.</p><p>He was tempted to ride straight on to Lydford, leaving Buckleigh-in-the-Moor behind him without so much as a farewell. But he had to return. He\u2019d left his bags at the Three Hounds, for one. His horse hadn\u2019t been fed, and neither had he.</p><p>Most of all, he needed to see Meredith again. He owed her an apology for that boorish proposition last night. Simply because she\u2019d been the only soul in the village to greet him with civility, it didn\u2019t follow that she\u2019d eagerly fall into bed with him. He couldn\u2019t think what had possessed him to even suggest it. He\u2019d been so tired and bleary-eyed, and just a bit drunk on those soft, shy glances. He\u2019d simply wanted to get close to her and stay there for a while, and learn if her hair smelled as lovely as it looked. And afterwards, sleep. Sleep and forget, instead of spending the night tossing and cursing the rafters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Naturally, she\u2019d refused him. As well she should. And she\u2019d mustered the generosity to knock on his door and grant him a sort of absolution, but she hadn\u2019t been brave enough to look him in the face as she gave it. Still, he couldn\u2019t resist stealing a touch.</p><p>God, her skin was pure joy to touch. Fresh and smooth, like the underside of a leaf.</p><p>One glance in the washstand mirror this morning had revealed his lunacy. He was a hideous, cut-up wreck of a man. What could a woman like her possibly want with a fellow like him? Except money, perhaps. Not that she was the type to accept coin for her favors, but he didn\u2019t want her thinking he was the type to pay for them. He didn\u2019t use women that way anymore.</p> <p>No, she deserved an apology. He wasn\u2019t especially good at making amends, but he\u2019d do what he could. Greet her with a civil good morning, thank her for her hospitality, and pay her triple what he owed. And then he\u2019d ride straight out of the village and never trouble her again.</p><p>The gelding picked its way along the narrow, well-trod path. It wasn\u2019t the most direct route back to the village, but it was the safest, as evidenced by the cross-shaped stone markers placed by monks centuries ago. A man who wandered off the safe path risked stumbling into a bog and becoming trapped in waist-deep peat and muck. As a child, Rhys had known the lay of these slopes better than he\u2019d known his ciphers, but he didn\u2019t trust his memory enough to risk miring his horse today.</p><p>It was full morning by the time he descended into the small valley that cradled Buckleigh-in-the-Moor. Sunlight chased the mist into dark hollows and nooks. Considering the harshness of the surrounding terrain, this truly was a well-favored spot. A brisk stream had carved this gorge over millennia, and aside from the ready water source, the valley offered some protection from the brutal Dartmoor winds. The village even claimed a few dozen trees to its name, and they grew reasonably straight\u2014an unusual occurrence on the windswept moors.</p><p>As he reunited with the main road and entered the village proper, however, Rhys noticed what he hadn\u2019t been able to see last night. Very little had changed in this village. Too little had changed, as a matter of fact. There were no new buildings. Neglected cottages had fallen into disrepair. Just as Meredith had told him, the village had not prospered in the Ashworths\u2019 absence. A thorn of guilt pricked him deep inside.</p><p>He turned toward the inn. Like most buildings in town, its foundations were stone, but its walls were fashioned from cob, a cured mixture of earth and straw. Slate shingles gave it a sounder roof than the usual thatch. With a gleaming coat of fresh limewash and green-painted shutters, the inn was by far the best-kept structure in the town, and the largest. Even at this early hour, the courtyard buzzed with activity. It was clear to Rhys that the Three Hounds was not only the physical center of the village, but its social and commercial center as well. And little Merry Lane now managed it all. Remarkable.</p> <p>In the courtyard, he dismounted and walked his gelding toward the stables. A hunched figure rushed to meet him, hobbling with the aid of a wooden crutch.</p><p>\u201cLord Ashworth! By God, it is you. Merry told me you\u2019d come back, but I could hardly believe her.\u201d The old man leaned on his crutch and tipped his hat, revealing a flash of silver hair beneath.</p><p>\u201cMr. Lane,\u201d Rhys said, catching his breath. \u201cIt\u2019s ... it\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t. It was hell to see George Lane as he was now\u2014bent, aged, crippled and scarred. In Rhys\u2019s memory, he\u2019d remained a man in his prime of life, an expert horseman gifted with an even temper and a steady hand. The Nethermoor stables had been Rhys\u2019s refuge in his youth, and Lane had always been kind to him. When fire broke out in the stables that night, it was George Lane who dragged Rhys\u2019s barely conscious form from the blaze. Once Rhys was safe, the stable master worked valiantly to save the horses. He succeeded in a few cases, but failed in most. During his last rescue attempt, a burning rafter had fallen on his leg.</p><p>Rhys had been sent to relations in Yorkshire immediately following the fire, and in the years since he\u2019d never so much as written to inquire after his old friend\u2019s condition. Probably because he\u2019d suspected, rightly, that his friend\u2019s condition would be just this. He was maimed for life.</p><p>That little thorn of guilt was swiftly growing tendrils and vines, twining his innards in a stranglehold.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the horse in.\u201d Smiling, the old man balanced his crutch under one arm and reached for the reins with the other. \u201cYou go on in and have breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Rhys reluctantly handed him the reins. He wished Lane would allow him to do the labor of unsaddling and grooming the horse, but he wouldn\u2019t insist. He\u2019d known many soldiers crippled in battle, and he\u2019d learned to never second-guess their abilities.</p><p>Besides, George Lane couldn\u2019t be too hampered by his injuries. He still kept an immaculate horse barn, from what Rhys could see as he followed him to the stable door.</p><p>\u201cNo need to come in,\u201d Lane called to him, holding him off with an outstretched hand. \u201cYou know I\u2019ll take excellent care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Rhys said, wondering why the man didn\u2019t seem to want him in his stables. Well, it could have something to do with the fact that his last stables had burned to the ground. If he were George Lane, Rhys wouldn\u2019t trust himself in there either, come to think of it.</p><p>He propped his shoulder against the wide post of the doorway and spoke into the darkened interior. \u201cIt\u2019s a large barn you\u2019ve got here. Your daughter told me it\u2019s mostly pack ponies you keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Lane replied. \u201cI started breeding them a decade ago, from a few wild ponies I brought in off the moor. They\u2019re well-trained now, and hardy. We rent them out as they\u2019re needed, to local farmers and such.\u201d</p><p>Rhys shook his head. What a waste of the man\u2019s skill. \u201cI wonder that you don\u2019t keep posting horses.\u201d To expedite travel, private and public coaches changed horses frequently. If the Three Hounds offered posting horses for hire and exchange, the inn could draw a great deal more business.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to,\u201d the man answered, \u201cbut I\u2019ve no suitable breeding stock. Hard to gather that kind of coin, especially in a village where folk pay their debts with eggs more often than shillings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d Rhys startled as something prodded the back of his knee. He wheeled to find a pair of long-eared hounds nosing at his boots. \u201cGo on,\u201d he told them, feinting a kick. \u201cI\u2019ve no scraps for you.\u201d</p><p>Though oddly, he could have sworn he smelled fresh-baked bread.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just being friendly,\u201d a feminine voice said. \u201cIt\u2019s me they\u2019re after.\u201d</p><p>Meredith stood before him, both arms wrapped around a large woven basket. A bounty of yeast rolls peeked out from beneath a printed muslin cloth. Rhys\u2019s stomach churned with awakened hunger.</p><p>Damn, his whole body was churning with awakened hunger.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still here,\u201d she said. \u201cThought perhaps you\u2019d left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. And then I came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how this inn got its name,\u201d she said, watching the dogs nip the tassel of his boot. \u201cMaddox only ever kept two hounds. When he was drunk, he used to tell smart-mouthed travelers the third hound was in the pie.\u201d She spared him a fleeting glance before calling past him into the stables. \u201cFather, I\u2019ve told you, leave that work to Darryl. You\u2019re not supposed to be straining your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m brushing down the finest gelding in Devonshire. It\u2019s a pleasure, not a strain. And Darryl\u2019s gone to fetch water.\u201d</p><p>Rhys heard her release a frustrated sigh. Her brow creased with concern. \u201cFather, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rhys laid a hand to her shoulder and drew her away from the door. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t tell a man what he can\u2019t do. He\u2019ll only be more determined to prove you wrong.\u201d</p><p>Her face couldn\u2019t decide what expression to take. Her brow was more than a mite annoyed with his interference, and her cheeks were turning an embarrassed pink. But her lips twitched at the corners as though she might cry, and her eyes ...</p><p>Her eyes were just beautiful. They made him too stupid to hold his next thought. If it hadn\u2019t been for the mountain of bread between them, he would have embraced her then and there.</p><p>Embraced her, of all things. What an idea. Where were these fancies coming from? Meredith Maddox was a beautiful woman, and there was no denying that he craved her body more than he craved a peaceful night\u2019s sleep. Any man with a pulse would feel the same. But this wasn\u2019t just lust. He\u2019d never experienced such longing simply to take a woman in his arms and keep her there. He\u2019d wanted to kiss her last night, and he\u2019d never been much for kissing at all. It smacked of romance and innocence and all those other things that had nothing to do with him. His past encounters with women had borne a remarkable resemblance to his fights\u2014impulsive, brutish, and never very satisfying.</p><p>What he wanted with Meredith was different. This strong, self-sufficient woman had awakened a tender impulse inside him. He was responsible for the state of her life. For the state of this village, in fact. It was his fault that it was barely dawn, and she\u2019d already been working hard for hours. His fault that she had to play caretaker to an invalid father by day and constable to a band of unruly drunkards by night. Every hobbled step her father took, each tiny callus on her hand, every spot of blood on her dainty white tablecloth ... all of it was his own damn fault.</p><p>\u201cThere was a doctor last year, passing through,\u201d she said softly, gazing unfocused at the bread. \u201cHe examined Father in exchange for free room and board. His heart\u2019s weak, the man said. If he doesn\u2019t slow down ...\u201d</p><p>Rhys gave her shoulder a light squeeze. \u201cI\u2019ve known your father almost as long as you have, Merry. Horsemanship is in his blood. It is his life. He\u2019d rather die than slow down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know it, but ...\u201d She looked up at him and gave a one-shouldered shrug, as though he\u2019d understand without any words.</p><p>And he did. Suddenly, Rhys understood everything. The reason he\u2019d survived the past fourteen years and finally made his way back to this village. The reason he couldn\u2019t leave it now. The way to redeem his whole wasted life.</p><p>It all made perfect, unquestionable sense.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it Sunday?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied in a bewildered tone.</p><p>He looked about the courtyard. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the people in church? Where\u2019s the vicar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no vicar anymore. He left twelve years ago, when your father ceased paying his living. A curate comes out once a month from Lydford to hold services.\u201d</p><p>He swore softly. This made things a touch more difficult.</p><p>She gave him a cheeky smile. \u201cWhat is it? Feel the need to confess your sins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell. That would take years.\u201d And he didn\u2019t particularly want forgiveness. No, he just wanted to make things right. \u201cConfession isn\u2019t required, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRequired for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage.\u201d</p><p>A roll tumbled from her basket, and the hounds scrabbled over it at their feet.</p><p>When she spoke, her voice was strangely brittle. \u201cYou\u2019re engaged to be married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I will be, soon.\u201d Before breakfast, he hoped. God, he was hungry. If she lost another roll from that basket, it would never reach the hounds.</p><p>\u201cAnd you intend to marry your bride here? In Buckleigh-in-the-Moor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the village church isn\u2019t the grandest, but it\u2019ll do. Wouldn\u2019t make sense to go elsewhere, now would it? Travel would be hard on your father.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look of utter bemusement. \u201cYou wish to be married here. In this remote village. Simply so my father can be a guest at your wedding.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, I thought you\u2019d want him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord, why on earth would I care if my father attends your wedding?\u201d</p><p>The corners of Rhys\u2019s mouth twitched with amusement. Hell, he suspected he was close to grinning, and he didn\u2019t grin. Ever. But he was rather looking forward to learning how it felt.</p> <p>Awareness sharpened her gaze. \u201cOh no,\u201d she said.</p><p>Oh, no?</p><p>Oh no, indeed. That wasn\u2019t the reaction he wanted. This would all be much easier if she\u2019d simply accept the rightness of it. The inevitability.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t him she\u2019d focused on. Her gaze trained on a spot somewhere behind his left shoulder. \u201cHere comes your welcoming committee.\u201d</p><p>He turned around. Coming toward him were the two brawling apes from last night\u2014Bull and Beak to him; he couldn\u2019t remember their real names\u2014surrounded by a dozen other men. Rhys recognized some of them from the inn yesterday, but other faces were new.</p> <p>To a one, they all carried flaming torches.</p><p>\u201cAshworth,\u201d Bull said, \u201cwe\u2019ve come to escort you out of the village. For good.\u201d</p><p>Inside the stables, Rhys could hear the ponies growing restless and uneasy. He was uneasy, too. He couldn\u2019t abide open flames this close to a horse barn. But the band of fools holding the torches ... they inspired nothing in him but derision.</p><p>\u201cHarold and Laurence Symmonds, what the devil are you doing with torches?\u201d Meredith asked. \u201cIt\u2019s full daylight, you idiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo inside to your father,\u201d Rhys murmured to Meredith. \u201cMake certain he\u2019s safe. I\u2019ll handle this.\u201d</p><p>She disappeared into the stables.</p> <p>Rhys stepped toward the center of the courtyard. \u201cVery well. You\u2019ve got my attention. Now say what it is you mean to say.\u201d</p><p>Harold Symmonds spat in the dirt. \u201cThe Ashworths were a scourge on this village. Fire burned Nethermoor Hall to the ground fourteen years ago and drove your folk from the moors forever. You should have stayed away, too. Now we\u2019re here with these torches to show you, fire will run you off the moor again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Rhys said, scratching his neck. \u201cAnd yet I seem to be standing in place.\u201d</p><p>A gunshot cracked through the air.</p><p>Rhys wheeled around, searching for its source. He didn\u2019t have to search hard. Gideon Myles stood in the doorway of the stables, smoking pistol in hand.</p><p>\u201cYou peat-for-brains idiots. I\u2019ve a wagonload of\u201d\u2014he threw a glance at Rhys\u2014\u201cof dry goods in this barn, and I\u2019ll put a lead ball in each of you before I\u2019ll allow you to burn it down around my ears.\u201d</p><p>The mob was abashed.</p><p>\u201cIt was all his idea.\u201d Laurence jabbed a thumb toward his companion.</p> <p>\u201cIt was not, you lying cur!\u201d</p><p>Here they went again.</p><p>Laurence made a sweeping gesture with his torch, sending men leaping backward to avoid being singed. The two faced off, circling one another in the middle of the courtyard. Their band of followers, who\u2019d clearly come on this errand for its amusement value, seemed happy enough to attend another fisticuffs in lieu of a lynching.</p><p>This time, Rhys was not going to stand back and watch. He stepped between the two men and grabbed each of them by the shirtfront. He grimaced as the torches\u2019 greasy smoke assailed his nostrils. One flex of his arms, and he could bash their skulls together and put an end to the whole scene. But he couldn\u2019t keep addressing every problem with violence. He didn\u2019t want to live angry anymore. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said, easing his grip. \u201cThat\u2019ll be enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFire! Fire!\u201d</p><p>The panicked shout rose up behind him. Before Rhys could register its origin, a wave of ice-cold water sloshed over his head, dousing him to the skin. The shock of it froze him in place for a moment. An icy rivulet crawled down his back, and he shivered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d a meek voice behind him said. Rhys recognized it as belonging to Darryl Tewkes. He turned around, and there the youth was, twitchy eye and all.</p><p>\u201cSo sorry,\u201d he stammered again. \u201cI was aiming for the torches, you know.\u201d</p><p>With a gruff sigh, Rhys shook himself. Water droplets flew everywhere. He took the fizzling torches from the two men, turned them wrong-end-up, and stubbed them in the dirt.</p><p>\u201cListen up, every one of you.\u201d The sound of gunfire had drawn gawkers, and had the whole village listening now. Damn it, he hated making speeches. He tried to keep his voice even. \u201cYou can bring your torches and your guns and your\u201d\u2014he rolled his eyes and flapped a wet sleeve at Darryl\u2014\u201cpails of cold water, and whatever else you please. You can\u2019t intimidate me. Fire, gunshots, drowning ... I\u2019ve been through each, and I\u2019ve survived them all.\u201d</p><p>He stared down Harold and Laurence. \u201cYou fancy yourselves good in a fight? I fought for eleven years with the Fifty-second, the most decorated regiment in the British Army. Light infantry foot guards, the first line to attack in any battle. Fought my way through Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium. At Waterloo alone, I personally gutted seven members of Napoleon\u2019s Imperial Guard. And those are just the ones I killed up close.\u201d</p><p>Calmly, he turned to Gideon Myles. \u201cYou want to play with guns? I can do that, too. Rifle, musket, pistol ... take your pick. I can clean, assemble, and load any one of them in under a minute. I don\u2019t waste black powder, and my aim is true.\u201d</p><p>And since he had the town\u2019s ear, he went on, \u201cI\u2019m also impervious to idiocy, I\u2019ll have you all know. A couple of Portuguese peasants once found me bleeding in a field, shot through the shoulder in a skirmish. Dragged me back to their henhouse and kept me there for the better part of a week, just sticking a poker between the slats every so often to jab me in the side and judge if I was dead yet.\u201d He turned to Darryl. \u201cYou there, with the bucket. Do you know how to say \u2018water\u2019 in Portuguese?\u201d</p><p>Darryl shook his head no.</p><p>\u201cNeither did I, damn it. And yet I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m bloody well indestructible. Add to that, I\u2019m Rhys St. Maur, your legendary living phantom, and you sure as hell can\u2019t scare me off my own cursed estate.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Rhys had spoken all the words he intended to say. No one seemed to know what to do next. Harold, Laurence, Gideon Myles, Darryl ... they all just stood there, gawping at Rhys, then gawping at one another. Band of bloody fools.</p><p>A yeast roll bounced off of Harold Symmonds\u2019s forehead, breaking the collective trance.</p><p>\u201cGo home.\u201d Meredith was suddenly next to him, still holding her basket of bread with both hands. Her voice rang through the courtyard. \u201cGo home, all of you.\u201d</p><p>One by one, the villagers turned and left. Myles disappeared back into the stables, presumably to resume keeping watch over his precious wagon. It struck Rhys that the man was inordinately protective of a load of \u201cdry goods.\u201d</p><p>He released his breath slowly, feeling the tension in his muscles dissipate as well.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d She looked him over from crown to boots. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for that scene.\u201d</p><p>He wrung the water from his shirtfront, standing back so as not to drip on her bread. \u201cDon\u2019t be. Wasn\u2019t your fault. And I needed a bath.\u201d</p><p>He looked up to find her frozen in place, her eyes riveted to his sodden shoulders and chest. He couldn\u2019t quite name the look in her eyes, but he suspected it was revulsion. With his shirt clinging to his body and his hair matted to his head\u2014not to mention the fact that he\u2019d just been met by a torch-bearing mob\u2014he must have the look of a gothic monster.</p><p>\u201cA bath,\u201d she said suddenly, shaking herself to life again. \u201cYes, of course. I\u2019ll have water drawn and heated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t. The pump will do well enough for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you please, then.\u201d She turned to leave.</p><p>He caught her arm. \u201cI ... Merry, I\u2019m sorry to bring you so much trouble. I\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d make it up to all of them. To be sure, some of the residents of Buckleigh-in-the-Moor were right fools, and he\u2019d never win any popularity contests here. But the majority of the villagers had to be decent, honest souls, and they had good reason to view him with suspicion. They\u2019d all come around in time.</p><p>Meredith bit her lip. Her cheek dimpled with a fetching, lopsided smile. \u201cYou bring all sorts of trouble, Rhys St. Maur, and you always have done. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of Harold and Laurence and the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain you will.\u201d She seemed to be taking care of the whole village. This inn, the travelers, her invalid father, the lives and fortunes of all these idiot men.</p><p>But who was taking care of her?</p><p>He asked, \u201cHave you eaten your own breakfast yet?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head no.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this, then,\u201d he said, backing away. \u201cI\u2019ll wash at the pump. You find us a morsel to eat. And then we\u2019ll sit down to breakfast together and fix our wedding date.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>As she laid the table for breakfast, Meredith refused even to think about Rhys\u2019s words to her outside. Surely her ears had deceived her. There was no way in Creation that he meant to propose marriage to her after a single night at the Three Hounds. Her accommodations were nice, but not that nice. She didn\u2019t even have any ham or bacon. Until Mrs. Ware came in, there\u2019d be no meat to serve except cold mutton pie. Just rolls and the whortleberry jam. And fresh cream and boiled eggs, and coffee made with cool spring water. Here was one consolation: The Three Hounds brewed the best coffee in England, or so a well-traveled guest had once proclaimed. Not that Meredith could know from experience. The farthest from home she\u2019d ever been was Tavistock.</p><p>She\u2019d just finished setting the table for two when Rhys entered the dining room, freshly bathed and dressed in a clean shirt and breeches. His hair was so short, it was already dry. She wanted to run her fingers over it, to see if it felt soft like goose down, or blunt, like clipped grass.</p><p>Lord, what was she thinking? That scene in the courtyard had made it perfectly clear that for Rhys\u2019s own safety and the harmony of the village, she needed to feed him and send him on his way. Today. No hair-stroking would be involved.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you be seated, my lord?\u201d She tried for a breezy, casual tone. \u201cDo you care for coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. And please, just call me Rhys,\u201d he said, settling onto a wooden stool. \u201cNot enough people do.\u201d He accepted the mug of coffee she handed him. Their fingers brushed in the exchange, and the sensation was electric.</p><p>He took a fearless swallow of the scalding brew. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, plunking the mug to the table, \u201cwhen does this curate come into the village next? How soon can we be married?\u201d</p><p>That electric tingle became a full-body shock.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can. I\u2019m quite frequently serious. Do you think I\u2019d enter into marriage lightly?\u201d</p><p>A startled bubble of laughter escaped her. \u201cWhat else can I think, when you\u2019ve just walked through the door yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as though I\u2019m a stranger to you.\u201d He sipped his coffee again. \u201cYou\u2019ve known me since you were a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore last night, I hadn\u2019t laid eyes on you in fourteen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d A little smile crooked his lips. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it destiny. We\u2019re fated to wed.\u201d</p><p>Meredith felt as though she\u2019d been wedged into an old wine cask and set rolling down the rocky slope of Bell Tor. Rattled, disoriented. Just a bit drunk.</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to marry you.\u201d And she didn\u2019t, not anymore. They needn\u2019t discuss the scraps of foolscap she\u2019d covered with \u201cMeredith St. Maur, Lady Ashworth\u201d when she was twelve. \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry at all.\u201d As a widow, she owned this inn outright. That wouldn\u2019t be the case if she took a husband. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He said calmly, \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned over the years, it\u2019s that fate doesn\u2019t care what we want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t believe in fate.\u201d She hugged herself tighter still.</p><p>\u201cFate doesn\u2019t care whether we believe in it, either. That\u2019s the devil of it.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cMeredith. Lay down that shield you\u2019re making with your arms and come sit with me.\u201d When she hesitated, he lifted a brow. \u201cIt\u2019s only breakfast.\u201d</p> <p>Was it?</p><p>As she sat down, he picked up a knife and buttered a roll. \u201cYou\u2019d understand what I mean about fate if you\u2019d lived through a war in my boots.\u201d</p><p>The words settled like stones in her chest. \u201cWas it true? Everything you said out there in the courtyard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and more.\u201d He bit into the roll, taking two-thirds of it into his mouth in one bite.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ...\u201d Heartbreaking. \u201cRemarkable, that you\u2019ve survived.\u201d She felt in that moment how close she\u2019d come, so many times, to never seeing him again. And it made her want to take him upstairs and pin him to the bed that moment. Make love to him just once, before he went away again.</p> <p>\u201cAh, well.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cNot so remarkable, really. Tried my best to leave this earth at every turn, but God and the Devil kept sending me back. Neither wanted me, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I just wanted you more.</p><p>To avoid speaking the words aloud, she tore off an unladylike hunk of bread and chewed it noisily.</p><p>Pushing his coffee aside, Rhys reached into his coat pocket and withdrew two coins. He let them clatter to the table, where they lay like brass checkers on the blue-and-white gingham weave. On closer inspection, they weren\u2019t like any coins she\u2019d ever seen. She picked one up and held it to the light, twisting it back and forth between her thumb and forefinger. The disc was irregular and crudely stamped. On one side a horse\u2019s head stood out in relief; on the reverse, she found a horse\u2019s tail.</p><p>She laughed at it. \u201cAre these foreign money from your travels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019re tokens that indicate membership in an elite gentlemen\u2019s society known as the Stud Club. Possession of one of those coins gives a man breeding rights to Osiris, England\u2019s most valuable stallion. The club rules state the tokens can\u2019t be bought or sold or given away. They can only be won or lost in a game of chance. There are only ten of them in the world, and at the moment I own two. Do you know how I came by them?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cFate, pure and simple. Through no merit of my own, I was spared while other men\u2014better men\u2014fell.\u201d He propped an elbow on the table and cast a glance through the window. The bright morning sun made him squint, wrinkling the scar tissue on his temple.</p><p>Taking one of the coins in his hand, he said, \u201cThis one belonged to an officer in my battalion. Major Frank Brentley, from York. He was a good man. His wife traveled with the company, and she mended my shirts for me. He never drank, but he was a gambler through and through, always dicing or playing cards. Story was, he\u2019d won this token drawing blind at vingt-et-un. Said he was blessed with good luck all his life.\u201d</p><p>He tapped the coin on the table. \u201cWell, his good luck ended at Waterloo. We had the left flank of the line, and a voltigeur came out of nowhere. One moment Brentley was next to me, the next he was flattened by a rifle shot at close range, his gut ripped open at the seams.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing with great care, Meredith put down the bit of bread she\u2019d been holding.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not proper breakfast conversation, I know. Anyhow, after I killed the French guardsman, I carried Brentley out of the action. Tried to make him comfortable. He pulled this token from his pocket. \u2018Have to play me for it,\u2019 he said. \u2018That\u2019s the rule. Heads or tails?\u2019 Then he died, and the coin rolled out of his hand, and it was too smeared with blood to make out the stamp on either side. But I\u2019d won the coin toss, hadn\u2019t I? It\u2019s the way my life goes. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve got a coin with \u2018Life\u2019 stamped on one side and \u2018Death\u2019 on the reverse, and no matter how many times I flip it into the air, it always comes up heads.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the other token. \u201cThis one belonged to Leo Chatwick, the Marquess of Harcliffe, the Stud Club\u2019s founder. Another good man. Had it all\u2014youth, wealth, good looks. Universally admired. Murdered in cold blood almost two months ago now, while walking the wrong part of Whitechapel. Beaten and robbed by footpads. Or so most believe. His killers were never caught.\u201d</p><p>Meredith winced. \u201cHow dreadful. Was he a very close friend of yours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that lesson. I don\u2019t make close friends.\u201d</p><p>The words made her ache with empathy, but they also twanged her pride. He\u2019d take a wife, but not a friend? The compliment implied by his proposal grew fainter still. Whatever reason he had for wanting to marry, it seemed to have more to do with these queer brass coins than it had to do with her.</p><p>With his massive, scarred hand he picked up a boiled egg and tapped it with the edge of his spoon until a web of tiny cracks covered the brown speckled surface. The measured caution in his movements entranced her. She couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m barren,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cMost likely. I was married for four years and never conceived.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, peeling the shell from the egg. \u201cMaddox was ancient. Doesn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just him.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cI\u2019ve had lovers since.\u201d</p><p>His face shuttered. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>What would he make of her now? She lifted her chin, refusing to feel shamed. \u201cHave I succeeded in changing your mind? Perhaps not so fated to be, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my meaning. I\u2019m just sorry you\u2019ve been lonely. I\u2019m a bastard for staying away so long. The fact that you\u2019re barren is of no importance. The last thing I want is a child. And you have my word, I\u2019ll not rush you into ... consummation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The breath left her lungs. She picked at the tablecloth. \u201cWell, there went my prime inducement for accepting you.\u201d</p><p>He looked puzzled. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when you offered a kiss last night ... you weren\u2019t just being generous?\u201d</p><p>Her face heated as she nudged the saltcellar in his direction. \u201cNo, Rhys. Generosity had nothing to do with it. At all.\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a moment, then shrugged. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>Why did he act so surprised? Surely he must be the recipient of a great deal of female attention, wherever he went. How could a woman not be attracted to him?</p><p>She watched as he picked up the naked, quivering egg he\u2019d so painstakingly shelled. He halved it with a single snap of his jaws. The muscles in his cheek worked as he quickly downed the remainder. What an intriguing combination of tenderness and power he embodied. She imagined herself bared and white and trembling before him. So slowly, carefully revealed, and then ... devoured. Just thinking of it made her a little bit afraid, and aroused beyond measure.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t wish to ... to get children,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhy on earth do you want to marry?\u201d When men took an interest in her, bedding was usually foremost in their minds. And it wasn\u2019t as though she had money or influence to offer. Not enough to sway a peer of the realm, at any rate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take care of myself. Quite capably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. And you take care of your father, and this inn, and the whole blasted village too. Things that should be my responsibility, now that I\u2019ve inherited. I can\u2019t allow you to continue working so hard. I\u2019m the lord of this place now, and I\u2019m going to assume my role in the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDid you not notice the mob that greeted you this morning? The villagers don\u2019t want your help. They want you gone.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a mob, it was a band of fools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may be fools, but they\u2019re big, strong fools. They could make real trouble for you, if they wished. And Gideon Myles is no simpleton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon Myles.\u201d He snorted. \u201cWhat is that man to you?\u201d</p><p>Was that sudden edge in his voice jealousy? It shouldn\u2019t thrill her, but it did. Straight down to her toes.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a business associate. And a friend.\u201d And a smuggler who won\u2019t hesitate to use violence, if it suits his purpose. She cleared her throat and continued, \u201cExactly what are your plans, Rhys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan to marry you.\u201d</p><p>That thrill shot through her again. \u201cOther than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan to live up to my responsibilities as lord. Give the village some means of support. It will take time, but I\u2019ll rebuild the estate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebuild? Rebuild Nethermoor Hall? Whyever would you want to do that?\u201d She knew what kind of childhood he\u2019d endured in that house. Why would he wish to rebuild it? Not to mention, no matter how much he wished it, Gideon Myles and his associates would never allow such a thing to occur. \u201cAnd how do you think you\u2019ll accomplish the construction? The local men will never work for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will if I pay them enough.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThe older ones still hate your father. The younger ones, what few there are, have grown up hearing all manner of superstition and tales. They\u2019ll be afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if I can\u2019t find local labor, I\u2019ll just have to bring in workers from Plymouth or Exeter, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will cost you dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve some lands in the North I plan to sell. And I\u2019ve lately come into some money. Not enough to restore Nethermoor Hall to full grandeur, but wisely invested it\u2019ll put a house together and leave enough left over to live on.\u201d</p><p>And if the investments weren\u2019t wise and they failed, what then? He\u2019d be bankrupt with no source of rents or income. He\u2019d leave again. Somehow every possibility ended with him leaving again.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t need to do this anymore when you marry me,\u201d he said, looking around the room. \u201cWork, I mean. I\u2019ll provide for you and your father both.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of her father, she felt a sharp twist in her chest. Drat him, he was making this so difficult.</p><p>\u201cBut I like the work here,\u201d she protested. \u201cI\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve done with this place, and I\u2019ve plans to do more still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could do far more as the lady of the manor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys ... you\u2019re being so na\u00efve.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cMe, accused of na\u00efvet\u00e9. I must say, I never thought that day would come. I\u2019ve a mind to engrave the date on a plaque.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten what life\u2019s like out here. Right now it\u2019s a pleasant summer\u2019s morn, but you must recall how winter gets. It\u2019s harsh, lonely, desolate. You can\u2019t actually want to live here again. And we\u2019ve learned to survive without a lord. Just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the devil not?\u201d Meredith certainly would, if she were Rhys.</p><p>\u201cCircumstances would only pull me back. It\u2019s fate.\u201d</p><p>With a low groan, she propped her elbows on the table and buried her face in her hands.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me,\u201d he said, leaning forward. \u201cI know. But when a man treads the border between this world and the next as often as I have, he starts to see the hand of fate everywhere. Sometimes in bright flashes, other times subtler shades. It\u2019s like discovering a whole new color, one most people just can\u2019t see. But I see it.\u201d He pulled her hands from her face. \u201cWhen you look at me, your eyes shine with it. I\u2019m telling you, this is meant to be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her heart fluttered. \u201cAnd what makes you so sure of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d He gestured at the breakfast laid out on the table between them. A few rolls, small earthenware crocks of butter and preserves. Two mugs of coffee and a dish of fresh cream. The plates were scattered randomly; crumbs dotted the checked tablecloth. The scene hardly looked like an omen of fate to her, but then\u2014she thought she grasped his meaning. The warm light shone on them both with familiar intent, leaving them nowhere to hide their imperfections from each other. She hadn\u2019t even pinned her hair properly this morning. To any casual observer, they would look like a couple having their thousandth breakfast together, instead of their first.</p><p>His warm gaze caught hers. \u201cIt just feels right, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>It did. It did. It was the rightest thing she\u2019d ever felt, and utterly terrifying.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight it,\u201d he said. \u201cMarry me.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t fight it? But he wasn\u2019t fighting fair. He\u2019d been gone for fourteen years, and now he strolled in one morning making promises to fulfill all his responsibilities and never leave again? Asking her and the village to abandon their hard-won security and place their futures right back in Ashworth hands? He offered a dream, but he\u2019d force her to give up her safe reality to grasp it.</p><p>She just couldn\u2019t take that chance. Not on the basis of one almost-kiss and some invisible glimmer of \u201cfate.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to say the words. \u201cNo, Rhys. I can\u2019t marry you.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes flared, and his hand balled into a fist. For a moment, he almost looked angry. Strange, after he\u2019d remained so cool and collected before the riled-up villagers. Here was a flash of the Rhys she remembered from all those years ago: wild, angry, untamed. Irresistible.</p><p>Just a few seconds later, he\u2019d suppressed that hot flare of emotion. His jaw relaxed, and he smoothed the tablecloth with his palm.</p><p>Of all the reasons why he needed to leave Buckleigh-in-the-Moor, this was the most compelling. She couldn\u2019t bear to see this place beat the spirit out of him forever.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She stood on weakened legs. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a long day ahead of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I will, Mrs. Maddox.\u201d He looked resigned as he rose from the table. \u201cThat I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I have Darryl saddle your horse?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no. I\u2019ll let him rest today.\u201d</p><p>She frowned with confusion. \u201cSo ... you mean to stay another night, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean to stay permanently.\u201d</p><p>Flustered thoroughly now, she sat back down. \u201cDid you not hear me, my lord? I\u2019m sorry if I was unclear, but ...\u201d God, did she even have the strength to refuse him twice? Once had been difficult enough.</p><p>He smiled and headed for the door. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Merry Lane, I heard you. I know you said you can\u2019t marry me. But I also know you will. Just not quite yet.\u201d</p><p>After Rhys disappeared upstairs, Meredith kept herself busy. It wasn\u2019t difficult. There was always work to be done, and this morning, the more mindless the task, the better. She\u2019d only just cleared the breakfast table when Mrs. Ware came in to start the day\u2019s cookery. There were tablecloths to iron and pewter mugs to scrub. Tomorrow afternoon the mail coach came through, and depending on the weather and condition of the roads, sometimes the driver stopped at the Three Hounds to rest the horses and allow passengers to take refreshment.</p><p>Before the noontime rush, she took a moment to rest. She picked up one of the newspapers Gideon had brought in the night before and opened it, smoothing the creased paper against the bar counter. Ostensibly the papers were for the inn\u2019s guests, but Meredith was the only one who read them. She read them all, every page. All those years of the war, she\u2019d scoured them for any mention of Rhys. In the weeks following a battle, she would sometimes find an account of his regiment\u2019s bravery or a list of casualties that mercifully did not include his name. Today, it felt as though she should snap open the paper and find the headline RHYS ST. MAUR RETURNED TO DEVONSHIRE. Perhaps if she saw the words in print, she\u2019d start to believe it was true. Though she doubted even the reporters of The Times could find a logical explanation for that scene over breakfast this morning. Perhaps the headline ought to read: IMPOVERISHED LANDLADY REFUSES LORD\u2019S OFFER OF MARRIAGE.</p><p>Underneath that, in smaller letters, BOTH COMMITTED TO BEDLAM.</p> <p>\u201cLeft your cask of Madeira in the storeroom.\u201d Gideon Myles appeared. He plunked a ceramic figurine on the counter. \u201cAnd this washed up in a cove near Plymouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it now?\u201d Meredith took the china shepherdess in her hand and examined it in the light. It was finely made and carefully painted. Exquisite.</p><p>Fragile.</p><p>\u201cAstonishing,\u201d she said, \u201cthat such a thing would survive being tossed about the waves and thrown up against a rocky shoreline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Gideon said innocently, his mouth tipping in a grin. The man was devilish handsome, and he knew it. Not only knew it, but made use of it. As an intermediary between Devonshire\u2019s coastal smugglers and the markets of Bristol, London, and beyond, Gideon used that roguish charm to line his pockets, warm his nights, and generally have an ungodly amount of fun.</p><p>\u201cRather a miracle,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThought she would look well in one of your redecorated rooms. Add a touch of class, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she will.\u201d She smiled down at the shepherdess. \u201cVery thoughtful of you, Gideon. I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>His brow quirked. \u201cHow grateful?\u201d</p><p>Impossible flirt. \u201cPint-of-ale grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. Was hoping for straight-to-bed grateful. But I won\u2019t turn down the drink. Next time, I\u2019ll bring a string of bloody emeralds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect those wash up in coves too often,\u201d she said, sliding him a tankard of ale.</p><p>He gave her a devious smile. \u201cJust have to know where to look.\u201d He threw back half his ale in one draught, and when he lowered the drink, his demeanor had changed. He stacked his arms on the bar. \u201cWhat\u2019s Ashworth doing back in Devonshire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, silently letting her know he didn\u2019t believe her ignorance for one moment.</p><p>Meredith shrugged. \u201cWell, he\u2019s inherited the lands now, hasn\u2019t he? Only natural that he\u2019d stop by to have a look at them.\u201d With a careful air of indifference, she added, \u201cPerhaps he wants to start fulfilling his role as Lord Ashworth.\u201d</p><p>Gideon coughed. \u201cWhy would he want to do that? I might just as soon take up the old vicar\u2019s legacy.\u201d</p><p>He forced a chuckle, but Meredith caught the wounded glint in his eyes. Gideon Myles had been orphaned as a small boy when his parents fell victim to a fever. The vicar had taken him in, sheltered and educated him for many years. But when the living dried up, the clergyman left the village and abandoned Gideon to fend for himself at the age of thirteen.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you like to be a vicar?\u201d she asked. He laughed again, and she protested, \u201cNo, I mean it. I think you\u2019d be better suited to the clergy than you credit. For all you cultivate that roguish image, you\u2019ve a good heart beneath.\u201d She laid a fingertip on the ceramic lamb kneeling at his mistress\u2019s feet. \u201cAnd a quick mind, as well. You\u2019re far too intelligent to be engaging in petty crime as a profession.\u201d</p><p>He looked away, and she thought she caught a blush rising on his throat. \u201cOptions are limited in these parts, aren\u2019t they?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a devil\u2019s life for me. But lately I\u2019m becoming far too acquainted with celibacy.\u201d</p><p>She laughed off his suggestive glance, knowing the words were just idle flirtation. As she\u2019d told Rhys, Gideon was a business associate and a friend. Nothing more. Granted, he was a strapping man with a natural drive, and he probably wouldn\u2019t refuse an invitation to her bed. But she liked him too much to risk ruining things for a night or two of pleasure. That\u2019s why the few lovers she\u2019d taken since Maddox died were all travelers passing through. No risk of emotional attachment.</p><p>Looking back, maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019d always been so drawn to Rhys. He was always in motion\u2014running, riding, brawling, fighting his way across the Continent. He was a man who\u2019d never allow anything to hold him in one place.</p><p>Except now he was back, vowing to do just that\u2014stay in one place.</p><p>\u201cHe said he wants to rebuild Nethermoor Hall.\u201d The words slipped out.</p><p>With a violent curse, Gideon plunked down his tankard. \u201cWhy the devil would he want to do that? It\u2019s worthless moorland up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it, but Rhys said ...\u201d Her voice trailed off as she realized her slip.</p><p>His eyes flashed. \u201cOh, Rhys said? On cozy terms with him, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like that,\u201d she replied tartly. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right it is my business.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cMy business. My livelihood. I can\u2019t afford his presence here, Meredith. Neither can you. Ashworth\u2019s already put me a day behind schedule. If he stays in the neighborhood, my trade is finished. If I can\u2019t keep up my trade, you won\u2019t have cheap stores for this inn. If the inn suffers, the whole village suffers. That man is nothing but trouble for Buckleigh-in-the-Moor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d She frowned, scrubbing at a water spot on the countertop that had been there for years and wasn\u2019t likely to go away anytime soon. \u201cAnd I tried to tell him as much, but ...\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t complete that sentence. I tried to tell him as much, but he insisted it was destiny that I marry him.</p><p>Mistaking her silence for genuine concern, Gideon stayed her wrist with his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry. He won\u2019t be in the village long. One way or another, I\u2019ll see to it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, knowing he would. And his protective touch was kind, she supposed, but it did nothing for her. Not like Rhys\u2019s touch last night. She still felt that light caress tingling on her cheek.</p><p>It feels right, doesn\u2019t it?</p><p>She shook herself.</p><p>Gideon said, \u201cIf no man in the neighborhood will work for him, cart for him, or sell to him, he\u2019ll be forced to give up soon enough. And if he doesn\u2019t ... well, there are other ways of convincing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike those torches this morning?\u201d</p><p>Cursing, he cocked his head and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI meant ways that involve real men and real weapons. Not a pair of inbred apes and a simpleton stable boy with his water pail.\u201d</p><p>She pointedly ignored his mention of violence and weapons. \u201cSpeaking of Darryl, I\u2019d best call him and Father to their noon meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you call all the way to Nethermoor, then? Always knew you were a clear-spoken woman, but that would astonish even me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Darryl\u2019s not up at Nethermoor. I just saw him, not ten minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Darryl. Your father.\u201d He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cMy father? Up at Nethermoor? What\u2019s he doing up there?\u201d</p><p>Gideon shrugged and tipped his ale. \u201cBetter ask him that, hadn\u2019t you? Or your friend Rhys. It\u2019s the two of them up there together. My man just brought me the news.\u201d</p><p>Meredith put aside her rag.</p><p>\u201cNot that I mind. The Symmonds boys are loading the ponies as we speak. We\u2019ll take them out toward Two Oaks and then around the long way. Ashworth and your father can stay out there all day, so far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I have something to say about it.\u201d She jerked at her apron strings, her fingers clumsy with nerves. Her father should not be out on the moor in the midday sun. That sort of exertion could endanger his health.</p><p>Gideon was right. Rhys\u2019s presence here was nothing but trouble for them all. She would go tell Rhys St. Maur to let her father be, pack up all his silly proposals, and leave the village today. And then she would somehow excise him from her imagination and get on with her life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had to move on, and so did she.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Straining under the midday sun, Rhys hefted a chunk of lichen-crusted moorstone from its bed of gorse. A bead of sweat trickled down his bare back as he carried the rock up the sloping grade, then tossed it to the ground with a grunt, nudging it into place with his boot. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s big enough?\u201d he asked, wiping his brow and squinting at the ground. The stones formed almost three sides of a rectangle now. A few more hours\u2019 work, and he\u2019d have a completed outline for the foundation. \u201cMaybe I ought to make it wider.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s already near as big as the inn,\u201d George Lane said. \u201cThought this was meant to be a cottage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d The finest damn cottage ever built.</p><p>And once Meredith saw it, she\u2019d know he was serious about being here to stay. About marrying her. Not that he could claim to be surprised by her initial reluctance. As a suitor, he had little to recommend him aside from a bit of money in the bank. He surely wouldn\u2019t convince her on the basis of his fine looks and pretty manners. But once she saw the proof of his commitment to rebuilding the Hall and the village, she\u2019d change her mind. She was a clever woman, and she understood when a situation would work out to her benefit. She\u2019d married Old Maddox, after all, and Rhys would never believe that had been a love match.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you plan to put the door?\u201d Lane asked, limping his way around the nearly finished rectangle.</p><p>\u201cOver there.\u201d Rhys jerked his head as he hefted another stone. \u201cFacing northeast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAway from the ruins, then? Well, I don\u2019t blame you for keeping that sight at your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAway from the wind,\u201d Rhys countered.</p><p>The old man\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cAs you say.\u201d</p><p>Rhys chucked his stone in line with the others. He knew superstitions ran deep as granite here on Dartmoor, but surely George Lane didn\u2019t believe any of Darryl Tewkes\u2019s absurd ghost stories? \u201cI mean it,\u201d he said, wiping his brow. \u201cThat flat there\u201d\u2014he pointed to a level area nearby\u2014\u201cis the most logical place for new stables. The stable master\u2019s cottage ought to face it, don\u2019t you think? And I\u2019m guessing you\u2019d rather be upwind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStables?\u201d Leaning on his crutch, Lane slid the soft felt cap from his head and twisted it between his old, scarred hands. \u201cYou mean to rebuild the stables?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean to rebuild it all,\u201d Rhys told him evenly. \u201cStarting with the stables. I\u2019m a member of a club, you see. It\u2019s called the Stud Club. Membership includes breeding rights to a stallion called Osiris.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOsiris.\u201d The old man\u2019s hands began to shake. \u201cThe Osiris, the great thoroughbred champion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve heard of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard of him?\u201d Lane laughed. \u201cIn his prime, the sporting papers were filled with nothing but talk of that stallion. I heard he\u2019d been sold to a lord, though, some time back.\u201d He scratched the back of his neck. \u201cWhat was his name ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarcliffe. Leo Chatwick, the Marquess of Harcliffe. He\u2019s dead now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Did you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the loss of your friend, then.\u201d</p><p>Rhys shrugged. \u201cWe weren\u2019t close. Be sorry for him, not me.\u201d He walked some distance away and propped his boot on another chunk of stone, rocking it back and forth to work it loose from the soil. This one was rather square, he noted, and not too firmly stuck\u2014he\u2019d wager it belonged to the old house. Must have tumbled this way after the fire.</p> <p>He decided to leave it be.</p><p>He moved on to another rock instead and gave it a swift kick, jarring it loose. \u201cAnyway, as fate would have it, I now control a one-fifth share in that stallion, and I plan to breed a few mares to him next year. I\u2019ll be needing stables. And a stable master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ...\u201d Lane paused and sniffed. \u201cDo you mean me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there any other candidates around?\u201d Rhys made a show of turning his neck, surveying the barren landscape.</p><p>Releasing a slow, wheezing breath, George Lane picked the largest boulder available and sat down, sliding his crutch to a rest beside him. \u201cI\u2019m crippled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d Of course he knew. That much was Rhys\u2019s own damn fault. \u201cI mean to hire grooms, of course. You won\u2019t need to do the heavy work, merely supervise. There\u2019s no one else in these parts experienced in keeping and training horses of that caliber.\u201d</p><p>Lane swore softly under his breath. But when Rhys stole a glance at him, he could see the old man was smiling.</p><p>\u201cPosting horses,\u201d Lane said suddenly. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose you\u2019d be of the mind to breed some of those? \u2019Twould be a great help to Merry, with the inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t see why not.\u201d Rhys ceased working at the stone and crossed to sit near the old man. \u201cBut you won\u2019t have to worry about your daughter any longer, either. That\u2019s why I\u2019m making the cottage so large.\u201d</p><p>The old man frowned. \u201cMust be the old age, Rhys. I\u2019m not following you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis house is for you, eventually. But in the short term, all three of us will have to call it home. While the Hall is being rebuilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe three of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, me, and Meredith.\u201d Best have out with it now, Rhys figured. The old man would find out soon. \u201cMr. Lane, I\u2019m going to marry your daughter.\u201d</p><p>He had to hand it to fate. Wedding Meredith was a perfect solution. Beautiful in its simplicity, just like the cloudless sky above. With that exchange of vows, Rhys would take responsibility for not only Meredith\u2019s well-being, but that of her father and the village, too. He could see it all now. With the stables, they\u2019d raise both racing and draft horses, to be sold for a profit. Once he rebuilt Nethermoor Hall, he\u2019d be able to provide employment for half the village and give custom to the rest. The inn could continue, he supposed ... they\u2019d simply hire an innkeeper to look after it.</p><p>Rhys had so many plans spooling through his mind\u2014years\u2019 worth of them. Perhaps enough to fill decades. It was a foreign sensation, planning more than a day in advance. It felt good. He\u2019d heard gentlemen of his station, fellow heirs to the peerage, refer to their estate responsibilities as burdens. Oddly enough, today Rhys felt markedly lighter.</p><p>Lane stared at him in silence for some time. First one bushy eyebrow rose, then two. \u201cMarry her. You plan to make Meredith your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was more like the universe had planned it for him, but Rhys wouldn\u2019t quibble.</p><p>\u201cHave you told Merry that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Lane cocked his head, peering into the distance behind Rhys\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThat would explain why she looks so flummoxed.\u201d</p><p>Rhys turned on his heel to see Meredith cresting the rise, striding purposefully toward them with a basket threaded over her arm. The wind pulled strands of her dark hair loose, whipping them in all directions. As she drew near, she impatiently brushed the stray locks aside.</p><p>\u201cJust what is going on here?\u201d She addressed her question to Rhys.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m building a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA house? Whose house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur house. Well, at least a temporary one. Just a stone cottage. It\u2019ll take time to rebuild Nethermoor Hall. Years, maybe. I\u2019ll need to hire an architect, master craftsmen. So I reasoned we\u2019ll live here while it\u2019s under construction, and afterward, it can be your father\u2019s.\u201d He jabbed a thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the flat. \u201cWe\u2019ll be building the stables just over there, you see.\u201d</p><p>She stared blankly at the direction he\u2019d indicated. Then her gaze fell to the unfinished rectangle of stones.</p><p>Perhaps she didn\u2019t see.</p><p>He said defensively, \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t look like much yet. Just give me a few days. Once I start on the walls, you\u2019ll have a much better picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re planning to build an entire house by yourself? With your own two hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... yes. If I have to. I\u2019d prefer to hire local men to help, but after that display this morning, I gather they won\u2019t be too eager to accept.\u201d</p><p>Not at first, at least. But just like Meredith, once they saw that Rhys was here for good, in multiple senses of the term, the villagers would welcome his presence in the neighborhood. Or at least they\u2019d welcome the wages he could pay.</p><p>In the meantime, he\u2019d work alone. This was how he\u2019d gained his men\u2019s respect in the infantry\u2014he\u2019d never asked an enlisted soldier to do anything he wouldn\u2019t do himself. Not polish a buckle, not dig a grave. And he\u2019d certainly never hesitated to lead a charge into battle.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he told her, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. How much of a kitchen do you think you\u2019ll need? Do you want it facing the hillside, or the downslope? Considering the winds, it might make more sense to have the hearth on the hillside. Less heat lost that way. But then the downslope is nearer the leat, and you\u2019d be that much closer to the water source.\u201d</p><p>She put a hand on his arm. He stopped talking, instantly. The pressure of her hand on his bare skin ... he liked it. He liked it far too much.</p><p>\u201cI said I can\u2019t marry you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI recall it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll convince me to change my mind, simply by wooing my father?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>George Lane called out, \u201cMerry, we\u2019re going to breed prize racehorses! And Rhys here has plans to breed posting horses for the inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? Is that what \u2018Rhys here\u2019 said?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a cool, flinty glare that was no doubt meant to be intimidating, but Rhys had seen and laughed in the face of too many intimidating glares to be affected.</p><p>What did affect him, greatly, was the firm squeeze she gave his wrist.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d she said quietly, her gaze flitting toward her father. \u201cAlone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d</p><p>Meredith\u2019s body hummed with sensation as Rhys steered her aside, laying a hand to the small of her back. To be accurate, his hand was so big it covered more than the small of her back. His thumb lodged just under her shoulder blade, and his little finger rode the swell of her hip.</p><p>Once they were a few steps away, he turned to her and asked, \u201cNow what did you want to discuss?\u201d Good Lord, how was she supposed to think clearly, with him looking like this? Stripped to the waist, sweating, his muscles bulging from use and his skin burnt to a reddish-bronze by the sun. She tried dropping her gaze, but that was a mistake. His buff breeches clung to his hips and thighs like a coat of limewash.</p><p>With great effort, she pulled her attention back up to his eyes. The sun was so strong today, she had to squint, so she shaded her brow with one hand.</p><p>\u201cRhys, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m building a house. Laying the foundation.\u201d</p><p>She looked over at the carefully aligned rectangle of stones. In the background, the ruined remains of Nethermoor Hall stood sentinel on the hillcrest. How could he truly wish to build a new house here, in the shadow of that awful place?</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t good for my father,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s an old man, and he\u2019s been hobbled for fourteen years. He\u2019s not supposed to engage in strenuous activity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one doing the strenuous activity. He\u2019s only advising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter\u2014you\u2019re keeping him out here under the hot sun all day. That alone is a strain. Not to mention, you\u2019re filling his head with talk of stables and racehorses ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe he\u2019s excited about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meredith had to admit, her father did look happier and healthier than he had in months. Enthusiastic, even. But if this horse breeding scheme fell through, he\u2019d be devastated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain he is excited, and that\u2019s the problem. You\u2019re getting him all agitated about things that may never come to pass. It\u2019s not good for his heart.\u201d</p><p>And it\u2019s not good for my heart, either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not setting him up for disappointment. I\u2019m preparing him for eventualities. You\u2019re the one becoming agitated about things that won\u2019t come to pass.\u201d He chucked her under the chin. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, Merry Lane.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease ...\u201d When he said such things, with sincerity in those warm brown eyes, he made her want to believe him so desperately she could barely stand. \u201cPlease don\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>Not even Maddox had called her Merry, nor her lovers since. Her lovers hadn\u2019t called her anything at all. Well, the one nice gent had called her \u201clove,\u201d and then there\u2019d been that haunted-looking soul who\u2019d called her \u201cSally\u201d over and over again, then wept noisily in her arms for an hour afterward. That had been awkward. He\u2019d put her off the whole business for a year.</p><p>It had been a long time since she\u2019d felt a man\u2019s arms around her. And Rhys had some very fine arms. They could probably wrap around her twice.</p><p>Focus, Merry Lane.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too familiar, and you know it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even answer to Lane anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cWe should do this properly. I\u2019ll not call you by your Christian name till we\u2019re married. And even then, only after the novelty of calling you Lady Ashworth wears off.\u201d He smiled. \u201cMight take a month or two.\u201d</p><p>Who would have guessed it? The man could be downright charming when he wished to be.</p><p>And all too often, she could be a complete fool. \u201cY-yes, but ... That is, I mean ...\u201d She stammered a bit, dropping her eyes in an effort to gather composure. The effort failed.</p><p>A puckered scar on his chest snagged her attention. Near his right shoulder, about the size of a shilling and just as round. It must have been a musket ball wound. She got lost in that scar for a moment, wondering what had become of the ball. Was it still lodged somewhere within that dense, powerful shoulder? Or had it ripped straight through? In either case, it was a miracle his arm hadn\u2019t separated from the rest of him, and that he still had the use of the limb at all.</p><p>Abruptly realizing she was being rude, Meredith lifted her face to his. With relief, she noted he wasn\u2019t looking at her, either. He was staring intently, thoughtfully\u2014perhaps almost wistfully?\u2014at something beyond her. Which was odd, because she knew there was nothing behind her but rocks. For a moment, she resisted the urge to turn around.</p> <p>But then she gave in to temptation and turned away. Just as she\u2019d suspected, there was nothing to see but the same eternal moorland\u2014sloping gorse mottled with boulders. A harsh, endless landscape in shades of gray and brown and muted green, capped by a sky so endless and blue, she imagined an ocean couldn\u2019t rival it for depth or hue.</p><p>Not that she\u2019d ever been near an ocean.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty.\u201d He sounded surprised. \u201cThis place. Over the years, I\u2019ve never remembered it that way, but it\u2019s ...\u201d He sighed roughly. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Meredith stared, trying to imagine this vista through the eyes of someone who hadn\u2019t grown up looking at it every day of her life. She thought of the adjectives travelers used: forbidding, eerie, lonesome. Even some of the villagers avoided the high moorland for years at a time. Up here, there were no trees, no shelter from the wind and sun. No mercy. There was a reason they\u2019d built the war prison not twenty miles away. Despite the brilliant colors and vast expanse, to most this place resembled a jail made of emptiness rather than walls.</p><p>It took a certain courage, to look on this landscape and call it beautiful.</p><p>\u201cIt is beautiful,\u201d she said, turning to face him. And so was he. Rugged, scarred, wild ...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so, too. Since you\u2019ll be looking on this view the majority of your days, once it\u2019s finished.\u201d His smile was a flash of white in his tanned face.</p> <p>Beautiful. He was a beautiful, enormous, impossible fool of a man.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said slyly, \u201cif I had a few laborers, I wouldn\u2019t need your father out here at all. Surely you have some influence with the local men.\u201d</p><p>She did. But that wasn\u2019t the point. \u201cI know you mean well. But you can\u2019t expect to simply ride back into Buckleigh-in-the-Moor one night and have the village on your side the next morning. The name Ashworth is a curse in these parts. People still remember your father\u2019s misdeeds, even if you\u2019ve forgotten them.\u201d</p><p>He grew pensive, tight. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten them.\u201d</p><p>She cursed herself silently. Of course he wouldn\u2019t have forgotten them. They\u2019d been beaten into him but good. Even now, he probably still bore marks from them, somewhere under all those battle scars.</p><p>He said, \u201cI promise you, I remember my father\u2019s misdeeds as clearly as I recall my own. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been spared all these years, so I can return and set accounts to rights.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, his mood lightened. He smiled and stretched. The muscles of his abdomen rippled, drawing attention to the line of dark hair dividing them, like the old Roman leat scored the rock-solid moor. Meredith\u2019s mouth went dry.</p><p>He said, \u201cI ought to be working. Come now, Mer\u2014\u201d He raised an arm, his biceps flexing as he scratched the back of his head. \u201cMrs. Maddox. Surely you can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for goodness\u2019 sake,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cWould you please put a shirt on while we\u2019re speaking?\u201d</p><p>His face went red. \u201cOf course. I beg your pardon.\u201d Loping a few yards up the incline, he crouched to gather a scrap of white. As he bent, she noted a larger, uneven scar on the back of his shoulder. The answer to her question. Evidently that musket ball had ripped straight through.</p><p>A little shudder passed through her as Rhys strode back, yanking the shirt over his head and letting the linen drape loose about his waist.</p><p>There, now maybe she could think. Maybe. The sun was beating down on them both, but she knew she had only him to blame for her overheated condition. There was nothing to do but retreat and regroup.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this further tonight,\u201d she told him. \u201cBack at the inn. Dinner will be at six. See that you\u2019re not late. I\u2019ve brought you a packed luncheon in the meantime.\u201d She thrust the basket at him, and he took it, surprised. \u201cBe certain my father drinks enough water and finds some shade, or I\u2019ll have your hide. The weather\u2019s fair, but if there\u2019s a mist or a storm, you\u2019re both to stay right here, do you understand? I\u2019ll send men out to you. You\u2019ve been gone from these moors far too long to find your way in the dark. That\u2019s all I need, is for the two of you to go wandering into the bog.\u201d</p><p>He flicked a bemused glance toward the bright, cloudless sky. A chuckle rumbled from his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, her wits fraying at the edges. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re speaking like a wife already.\u201d</p><p>She made a dismissive gesture. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? And there you go again.\u201d</p><p>With a low growl of frustration, she turned to walk home.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a complaint,\u201d he called after her. \u201cI rather liked it.\u201d</p><p>So did she. So did she. And that was the most impossible thing of all.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>That evening, Rhys was halfway through his third plate of stew before he paused to draw breath. The day of heavy labor had left him ravenous and exhausted, but in a good way. An honest, productive way. With a pleasantly full belly, he sat back in his chair and watched Meredith as she went about the honest, productive business of running the inn. He shook his head. It wasn\u2019t right. His own day\u2019s labor was over, and she had hours yet to work. Had she even taken her own dinner?</p><p>Tonight she had a small group of travelers to tend\u2014a middle-aged man and two younger ladies. Rhys supposed one was the man\u2019s wife and the other his wife\u2019s sister or cousin or some such. But just watching them interact, damned if Rhys could pick out which was which. The man didn\u2019t favor either lady with particular attention or regard. Pathetic. What a waste of matrimony. Once Meredith was his wife, he\u2019d make certain every man in the room knew she belonged to him.</p><p>For this evening, however, he was forced to content himself with watching his future wife tend her customers\u2014serving them steaming plates of food and mugs of hot tea, chatting briefly with them about their journey. He hated that she\u2019d been forced to work so hard, but she clearly took some pride and enjoyment in it.</p><p>She gave him a smile as she passed his table on her way back to the bar. A sweet, fleeting curve of her lips\u2014and an accidental one, if her quick correction to seriousness was any indication.</p><p>As soon as Meredith left the travelers, down swooped Darryl Tewkes like a carrion bird. \u201cWill you fine gentlefolk be staying long in the neighborhood?\u201d He pulled up a stool to their table, crowding the ladies together. \u201cWe\u2019ve all manner of fascinating sights here in Buckleigh-in-the-Moor. I\u2019d be glad to tour you around, in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSights?\u201d the man asked through a mouthful of beef. \u201cWhat sights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, it\u2019s a mystical journey through time, you see.\u201d</p><p>Rhys drowned his groan with a large swallow of ale. He listened to Darryl launch into his now-familiar speech: the tinners\u2019 works, the cairns, the stone crosses, the tors ...</p><p>\u201cAnd best of all ...\u201d The gawky youth lowered his voice. \u201c... the haunted ruins of Nethermoor Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaunted?\u201d The two ladies echoed him in unison, then looked to one another wearing matching expressions of horrified glee.</p><p>They had to be sisters.</p><p>\u201cAye, the cursed house of Ashworth,\u201d Darryl continued, leaning in close.</p><p>Rhys cleared his throat and pushed back, scraping his chair legs against the flagstones.</p><p>Darryl froze. The two young ladies went so pale, they might have been ghosts themselves. After a long moment, Darryl raised his head and gave Rhys a chagrined, twitchy look, as if asking permission to continue.</p><p>With a quirk of his neck, Rhys picked up his ale and pointedly moved on, ignoring them all. Let Darryl Tewkes tell his fantastic stories while he could. Soon the name Ashworth would mean something different to this village. Something other than a curse, or a macabre sightseeing attraction for travelers passing through.</p><p>He caught sight of Meredith at the bar. She was smiling and flirting with a hunched old man as she poured him a glass of gin. Her hair was falling loose from its braid again, and heavy locks dipped and swooped as she bent to retrieve a glass or stretched high to replace the bottle on its shelf.</p><p>God, she was a joy to watch. He\u2019d grown accustomed to the idea of marriage very quickly, for a man who\u2019d shuddered at the very notion for the whole of his adult life. That, more than anything, proved it must be destiny.</p><p>Even now, as he watched those dark strands working loose from her plait, his fingers ached to stroke her hair. He\u2019d never taken time to do such a thing with a woman before. Perhaps he\u2019d felt the lanky strands of a harlot\u2019s hair slithering over his bare skin a time or two, but he\u2019d never wanted to touch it on purpose.</p><p>He wanted to touch Meredith everywhere. Caress her brow with the backs of his knuckles\u2014the callused pads of his fingertips were too rough. Curl his fingers in that hair, bury his face in it. Wake early on a Sabbath morning just to lie abed for hours and count every strand. A man could do that with his wife, couldn\u2019t he? Sprawl out on the mattress, tuck her head against his chest, and stroke her hair for the sheer pleasure of it? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d just need to keep his shirt on.</p><p>He silently cursed himself for that mistake. What had he been thinking, letting her see his bare torso, all the scars he\u2019d accumulated over the years? The look on her face as she asked him to put on a shirt ... She must have been disgusted. He could tell by the guarded, wary glances she kept throwing him.</p><p>Meredith ducked behind the bar and lined up four glasses for filling. Rhys started toward her, eager to make a better impression tonight.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think it.\u201d</p><p>Gideon Myles stepped in front of him. Rhys had to admit, the man had bollocks, to try that move with him.</p><p>\u201cLeave her be. She\u2019s not for you,\u201d Myles said in a low voice. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in this village for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? I\u2019ve a title and a pile of legal papers that say otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve a pistol.\u201d Myles\u2019s hand went to his waistband.</p> <p>Rhys waved his hand dismissively. \u201cYes, yes. Saw it this morning. I wasn\u2019t impressed then, either.\u201d He eyed the man closely, taking his measure. Average height, lean, and probably about five years Rhys\u2019s junior. His eyes held the hungry gleam of ambition, and pure arrogance fueled his swaggering step.</p><p>Rhys didn\u2019t like him. At all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very protective of those dry goods you carry, Mr. Myles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy trade is none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think it is. As the lord of this place, unlawful activity is my concern. And my concern ... well, that\u2019s your problem, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re transporting smuggled goods through this village, and you\u2019re worried I\u2019ll put a stop to it.\u201d</p><p>To his credit, Myles didn\u2019t even try to deny the charge. He coolly raised his eyebrows. \u201cAnd ...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re right. I will put a stop to it.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cLike hell you will. Stay out of my way, Ashworth, and I\u2019ll make no trouble for you. This is business, not personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s personal to me.\u201d Rhys took a small step toward him, forcing Myles to take a small step in retreat. \u201cIf you trafficked in French goods during the war, in even the smallest amount\u2014it\u2019s personal, indeed. Your \u2018trade\u2019 could have purchased the lead that ripped through this shoulder.\u201d He thumped his hand over the old wound. \u201cMissed my heart by inches.\u201d</p><p>The younger man set his jaw. \u201cCan\u2019t blame that one on me. If I\u2019d paid for that ball, it would have found its mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Forget me. Let\u2019s speak of others, then. How many casks of brandy do you think it took to fund each bayonet or saber that skewered one of my men in battle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Gideon\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cAbout as many as it took to keep these villagers from starving to death after you left Devonshire.\u201d</p><p>Touch\u00e9.</p><p>They stared at each other for a moment.</p> <p>\u201cGuess you were right,\u201d Myles finally said. \u201cIt is personal.\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cVery well, then. You have a week to get out of my village. Or I will personally make certain you leave.\u201d</p><p>Rhys just laughed and shook his head. \u201cYou and what army? Oh, wait\u2014I forgot. Armies can\u2019t kill me, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week.\u201d Myles backed his way to the door, pausing just before he left to add, \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a week. Don\u2019t let me catch you here.\u201d</p><p>The moment Gideon Myles left, Rhys ceased caring about him. As if he\u2019d allow some petty smuggler to dictate where and when he could be on his own land. What a joke.</p><p>He strolled over to the bar and sat down on one of the stools. He watched as Meredith tapped a fresh cask of wine. The defined muscles in her arms made a stark contrast with her delicate features and small frame.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a girl to help you in the evenings?\u201d he asked, looking about the room. \u201cA barmaid?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head as she poured. \u201cNot at the moment. My regular girl gave birth not a few weeks ago. Don\u2019t know yet whether she\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen does the post come through next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight I beg a few sheets of paper and some ink?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him, just shrugged as she left to deliver the glasses of wine. But a few minutes later, two leaves of heavy, cream-colored paper materialized on the bar before him, along with a quill and a small pot of ink.</p><p>\u201cWho are you writing?\u201d she asked, leaning both elbows on the bar. \u201cA friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d In fact, Julian Bellamy might very well be an enemy.</p><p>Along with Rhys and the Duke of Morland, Bellamy was one of the three surviving members of the Stud Club. He\u2019d been the closest to Leo, and, by all appearances, had been devastated by his friend\u2019s tragic death. Since the murder, Bellamy had seemed a man possessed, determined to hunt down Leo\u2019s killers and bring them to justice.</p><p>In recent weeks, however, a new witness had surfaced. If the whore who witnessed Leo\u2019s killing could be believed, Bellamy might have had something to do with the death.</p><p>Rhys would have preferred to ask Morland to send his belongings out to Devonshire. He and Rhys had exchanged more punches than words as schoolboys, but he now counted the man as a friend, of sorts. But the duke was currently honeymooning at his Cambridgeshire estate, leaving Rhys no choice but to write Bellamy. Murderer or not, there was no one else in London he could ask.</p><p>He worked slowly; with his stiff fingers, he had to take care if he wanted his penmanship to be legible at all. After half a page, he dropped the quill and paused to shake out his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you switch to your left?\u201d</p><p>He looked up to see Meredith back at the bar.</p><p>She nodded at his gnarled right hand. \u201cWhy do you still try to write with it? You favor your left, anyhow.\u201d</p><p>How did she know that? It was true, Rhys had favored his left hand from his youth. But he\u2019d been beaten for attempting to write with it. So he\u2019d switched to his right, and then he\u2019d been beaten for his poor penmanship. So he\u2019d practiced in secret, spent painstaking hours laboring over a paper and quill, until his awkward scratchings became effortless, flowing script.</p><p>And then he\u2019d just been beaten for something else.</p><p>\u201cCare for gin?\u201d Meredith held the bottle poised above an empty glass.</p><p>\u201cThank you, no.\u201d</p><p>With a little shrug, she tipped the bottle and poured anyway. After filling the glass to halfway, she put aside the bottle and raised the glass to her own lips.</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you much?\u201d she asked from behind the glass, casting a pointed look toward the room behind him.</p><p>Rhys threw a casual glance over his shoulder, having formed a good expectation of what he\u2019d see. He was right. Everyone in the room was staring at him. Their eyes were filled with hatred, fascination, fear, or all three. He recognized more than a few men from the torch-bearing mob that morning. Over by the hearth, Harold and Laurence Symmonds glared at him over tankards of ale.</p><p>\u201cAre they brothers or cousins?\u201d he asked, tilting his head to indicate the bull-headed, beak-nosed pair.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d At his obvious confusion, she explained, \u201cTheir mother took up with a pair of brothers. No one was ever able to sort out who belonged to whom. But yes, they\u2019re brothers or cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplains a few things,\u201d Rhys muttered. He turned back to Meredith and shrugged. \u201cThe staring doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019m used to it. They\u2019ll come around, in time.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t agree or disagree, just sipped her drink.</p><p>\u201cWhen we announce our engagement,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019ll come around that much faster.\u201d</p><p>She sputtered into the glass.</p><p>Rhys resumed writing his letter. \u201cStill so surprised? I told you, it\u2019s fate. As suitors go, I know I haven\u2019t much to offer you at the moment, but that\u2019s why I\u2019ve started the cottage. Made good progress on the foundation today. It should be large enough for all three of us, if I build two stories.\u201d He scratched the back of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019ll take some time, though, collecting that much stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She raised her eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019ve a great pile of stone, just sitting there atop the hill.\u201d</p><p>She meant the remains of Nethermoor Hall, of course. And she was right\u2014the crumbling heap was a ready supply of building material. But somehow, Rhys just couldn\u2019t stomach stealing rocks from his hellish past to build the house of his future. The cottage was meant to be a fresh start.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather save that for rebuilding the Hall,\u201d he lied. \u201cI\u2019ll gather moorstone for the cottage. Or quarry some granite out of the slope, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhy not just use cob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCob?\u201d Odd, he hadn\u2019t thought of that. Down here in the village, most of the buildings were fashioned from the traditional walls of packed earth.</p><p>\u201cOnce you have the stone plinth, all you need for a cob house is soil and straw,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier, and cheaper by far. And built right, it will last centuries.\u201d She looked up at the ceiling. \u201cIt\u2019s what I plan to use, when I have the chance to expand this place.\u201d</p><p>He looked up in surprise. \u201cYou have plans to expand the inn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have all sorts of plans for this inn.\u201d</p><p>He signed his letter, folded it, and shoved it in his pocket. \u201cTell me about them.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a mocking look. \u201cI\u2019m shocked you\u2019d ask, seeing as how they\u2019re fated to never come to pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor me. I\u2019d like to hear them anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She set a second glass on the bar and filled it halfway. Despite his dislike of liquor, Rhys didn\u2019t object. It was beginning to feel awkward, letting her drink alone. He didn\u2019t want to interrupt her or argue the point, so he accepted the glass and took a cautious sip.</p><p>Fire ripped down his throat.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he said, coughing. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Plymouth gin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a local brew. Cures all ills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCauses them, do you mean?\u201d He took another slow sip and found it burned less this time. \u201cGo on, then. You were telling me about your plans.\u201d</p><p>She refilled her own glass. \u201cAs I said, I plan to add a new wing when I have the chance. And by \u2018chance,\u2019 I mean funds, of course. Guestrooms on the upper floor and a proper dining room and parlor below. It\u2019ll adjoin the building just there,\u201d she said, indicating the direction with a jut of her chin. \u201cAcross from the stables. That way, the courtyard will be enclosed on three sides instead of two.\u201d</p><p>Rhys sipped thoughtfully as she went on, detailing her plans for quality furnishings and finer dining room fare. The Three Hounds was well-situated, she explained, positioned on the only road traversing this part of the moor. The inn six miles down the road currently took most of the travelers\u2019 business, but Meredith meant to change all that.</p><p>\u201cWith the war over, more people will be taking pleasure tours. There\u2019s no reason why the Three Hounds shouldn\u2019t have a slice of that pie.\u201d Her whole face became animated as she continued describing her plans. \u201cWith finer accommodations, larger rooms, some posting horses ... this place could be a real destination. A stopping place for gentlefolk passing through on their way to tour points west. Why should they not break their journey here and explore Dartmoor, too? As you said earlier, the moor can be a pretty place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful. I believe I used the word beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did.\u201d She gave him a shy smile. \u201cBeautiful, then.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes tangled and held. Rhys took a deep, slow drink from those lovely eyes. They made him feel refreshed. Washed clean, as much as a man like him could ever be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The longer he stared at her, however, the further the smile faded from her face.</p><p>In a nervous gesture, she moistened her lips with her tongue. Then she gave herself a little shake and announced to the room, \u201cHome time, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>The last few stragglers roused themselves from their stools and lumbered out the door, grousing as they went. One of them yawned, and Rhys could not help but do the same.</p> <p>\u201cYou must be exhausted,\u201d Meredith said briskly, wiping her hands on her apron after straightening the last of the chairs and latching the door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have kept you up so late, blathering on about my silly plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not silly plans. They\u2019re quite sensible ones.\u201d</p><p>Together they moved toward the back staircase. And even though they were plans she\u2019d never need to put into action, he admired the cleverness and spirit behind them. He admired those qualities even more than he admired her lovely hair and eyes\u2014and that was saying something. \u201cYou truly do have it all worked out, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. And I\u2019m proud of that. I\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve accomplished with the Three Hounds so far, but I know I could do so much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain you could.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you see ...\u201d She swallowed hard as they stopped at the door to his room. \u201cThe village, the inn, my father, me ... we\u2019ll all be just fine without you. You can leave, Rhys. Go live your life, and leave us be.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her words, he leaned one shoulder against the doorjamb. He wasn\u2019t going anywhere. \u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The words just tumbled out, and Rhys had no idea where they\u2019d come from. He didn\u2019t recall ever speaking those words to a woman before. Damn, everything with Meredith felt new. Or maybe he was just so green.</p><p>The gin. He blamed the gin. Liquor always made him maudlin and impulsive.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Rhys St. Maur,\u201d she said, grinning, \u201cwas that flirtation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t know how to flirt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome now, be truthful.\u201d She reached for the edge of his shirt collar and played with it coyly. Her voice husky, she said, \u201cAll this talk of marriage and destiny and fate\u2014it\u2019s all just a ploy to get into my bed, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Was he really that drunk, or did she sound hopeful?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said honestly. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Though Holy God, the very idea of taking her to bed had him reeling. Pictures filled his mind. Wild, depraved pictures, like the etchings soldiers carried in their boots and bartered for greater value than gold. And thanks to the damned flames of gin licking away inside him, Rhys was powerfully tempted to act those pictures out, in the flesh. In her flesh. He wanted to find her softest, most secret place and lodge happily there, all night long.</p><p>Vulnerability flickered across her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you want me?\u201d</p><p>Hell. Of course he wanted her. He wanted her so badly, his ears ached from clenching his jaw so tight. He wanted her so much, he could have pushed against this doorpost like Samson and brought down the whole damned inn.</p><p>But he\u2019d made that mistake yesterday\u2014pushing too hard, too fast.</p><p>He forced a casual smile. \u201cI\u2019m saving myself for the wedding night.\u201d</p> <p>Her burst of surprised laughter drew his gaze to her mouth, and there his gaze gladly lingered. She had lovely lips. A dusky pink shade, richer red toward the center. The lower one plumper than the top. Hers was a pretty face, but not a soft one. Her cheekbones sat high and proud. She had a determined set to her brow and jaw, and her chin tapered to a decisive point. But her mouth was a soft, lush, vulnerable curve in the midst of all that strength and resolve.</p><p>He wanted\u2014no, needed\u2014to taste it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered, standing straight and framing her delicate face in his big, gnarled hands. \u201cI won\u2019t take you to my bed just yet. But I\u2019ll take that kiss tonight.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>And take it he did, before Meredith even had time to draw breath. He pressed his lips to hers quickly, as if she might change her mind if he gave her the chance, or as if he might change his. The timing was off, and their lips mashed together at the wrong angle, and her eyes were still open.</p><p>For a moment, she felt fourteen again. Awkward, uncertain. Painfully aware of everything but the joy of being kissed.</p><p>But then he tilted her face a degree, and his mouth shifted a fraction against hers. She remembered to close her eyes.</p><p>And suddenly, they fit. Suddenly, this kiss was everything. And she still felt fourteen again, but in that blissful, giddy way of tumbling headlong down a rocky slope with no thought for caution, no purpose but to chase exhilaration and joy.</p><p>Rhys St. Maur was kissing her.</p><p>And it was wonderful.</p><p>They remained that way for an improbably long time, mouths pressed together in tender innocence. He made no move to part her lips or explore her mouth with his tongue, though she would have gladly allowed it. If he\u2019d wished, he could have taken everything. But he didn\u2019t even try. He just kissed her softly, over and over again. The corners of her mouth. Her top lip, then the bottom. Sweet little sips of gin and heat.</p><p>When at last he pulled back, she instinctively raised her hands to cover his, pressing them tight against her face and forbidding him to release her. The thought struck her that she could have been touching him all the while. She could have been stroking his hair, or smoothing her palms over the hard planes of his shoulders and chest.</p><p>Damn, she was a fool.</p><p>But she settled for this, dragging her thumbs over the back of his hands, tracing the delicate crooks between his fingers, and finally encircling his thick, corded wrists as she opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat was ...\u201d He looked down at her with a strangely puzzled expression. \u201cThat was nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Quite.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hands from her face. She reluctantly released his wrists.</p><p>With a self-conscious clearing of the throat, he reached behind him, groping for the latch. \u201cWell, it\u2019s late. I suppose I\u2019d better be ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>To hell with feeling fourteen again. And to the devil with \u201cnice.\u201d</p><p>With decisive speed, Meredith grabbed him by the collar, hauled herself up on tiptoe, and kissed him, hard.</p><p>He stumbled back against the door, and the moment of shock jarred his lips apart. She slid her tongue straight through that window of opportunity. That was all it took. Now he really, truly kissed her back. Mouths open, teeth clashing, tongues tangling. Desire evident.</p><p>Yes, at last. This was what she\u2019d been wanting\u2014this frenzy of wild tastes and rough textures. The slick heat of his tongue, the scrape of his whiskers, his heady male scent. Rhys St. Maur, the man. And her body responding to his, all woman.</p><p>Growling deep in his throat, he slid his hands around her waist and fisted them in the back of her dress, lifting her up and against him. Her whole body pressed flush to his. Her breasts squashed flat against his chest, and she could feel every deliciously solid inch of him.</p><p>Until, with a regretful moan, he lowered her to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Her voice was breathless, but she hoped her eyes communicated the proposition with greater success.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m well,\u201d he said, nodding absently. \u201cVery well indeed.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly, clinging to his neck. There was no doubt that Rhys St. Maur was all man, but in rare moments he had this sweet, uncertain, boyish look on his face. It endeared him to her all the more.</p><p>She bit her bottom lip and swayed gently in invitation. \u201cI meant, what do you think? About tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think\u201d\u2014he unlaced her arms from his neck and squeezed her hands before releasing them\u2014\u201cthat tonight, I\u2019ll have very vivid dreams.\u201d</p><p>To her disappointment, he found the door latch and slid it open. Before stepping inside his bedchamber, he dropped one last kiss on her cheek. \u201cAnd for once, I might enjoy them.\u201d</p><p>Five mornings later, Meredith sat in that same bedchamber, watching Rhys sleep. The first rays of dawn seeped in through the window. Gray, watery light, not yet gold. The white linens reflected it with a fuzzy glow, but the rest of the room remained in murky shadow.</p><p>A cock crowed in the courtyard. From the bed, Rhys answered with a low, soft snore.</p><p>Meredith released her breath and quietly adjusted her posture on the chair, just hoping the sun would rouse itself before Rhys did.</p><p>She hated resorting to this kind of spying, but she couldn\u2019t think of any other way to assess his ... health. Over the past week, she\u2019d developed a powerful suspicion that Rhys had suffered a war injury to his male anatomy. Why else would he have resisted that clear invitation the night they\u2019d kissed? Not to mention the subtler ones she\u2019d issued every evening since.</p><p>Part of her couldn\u2019t believe he was even still here. Contrary to all her arguments and the application of common sense, he\u2019d forged ahead with this cottage plan. Every night she\u2019d thrown him flirtatious glances in the bar. Surely he\u2019d come to his senses and leave any morning, she reasoned. She wanted one night with him first.</p><p>Last night had been the final indignity. He\u2019d come in from another day of hard work up on the moors. Damp from the pump, but still glowing with the day\u2019s exertion. Wildly attractive. He\u2019d sat down at his usual table, eaten his usual three plates of food whilst enduring the suspicious glares and muttered curses of the villagers. Then he\u2019d approached her at the bar to apprise her of the day\u2019s progress.</p><p>\u201cFinished fitting together the plinth today,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cNow that the foundation\u2019s done, I\u2019ll start preparing the earth for cob. I\u2019ll need to hire ponies from you tomorrow to haul up a load of straw. If all goes well, tomorrow I\u2019ll be able to start the first rise.\u201d He\u2019d yawned the grizzled, lazy-yet-lethal yawn of a lion. \u201cI think I\u2019ll turn in early tonight, unless you need me.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she needed him, all right. She\u2019d wanted to lean over the bar and kiss that sleepy mouth, right in front of the whole room. The sweet, bloody fool was building a house of stone and earth with his own two hands. For her father. How could she not want to kiss him? How could she not want to do far more than that?</p><p>Instead, she\u2019d whispered shamelessly, \u201cShall I come to your room after I lock up?\u201d</p><p>And though he\u2019d sucked in his breath, and his eyes had fair blazed with desire, he\u2019d bid her a polite good evening and retreated upstairs. Alone.</p><p>Something had to be wrong down there. Red-blooded men\u2014and Rhys was a fine specimen of a red-blooded man in his virile prime\u2014just didn\u2019t walk away from invitations that obvious.</p><p>Gradually, the room warmed with weak, yellow light. She blinked, bringing the picture before her into focus.</p><p>His huge frame overflowed the bed\u2014the same bed that would have felt lonely and half-empty if she\u2019d slept in it alone. He slept on his side, linens bunched about his legs and waist. From the glimpse of bare chest and leg, she could tell he was likely nude. But drat it, it was impossible to see what she needed to see from this vantage.</p><p>She rose from the room\u2019s single chair and crept toward the bed, hoping to get a closer look. Then she froze in place as he emitted a harsh, guttural sound. It was the sound of a man dealing a blow. Or taking one.</p><p>He thrashed suddenly, tangling in the bedsheets as his elbow jabbed the pillow. \u201cNo,\u201d she heard him moan. Then more forcefully, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She stood there, immobile, not knowing what to do. Should she wake him? Did she dare? If he were reliving some fight or battle in his dreams, he might lash out at her in confusion. Perhaps she should just leave him. No one ever suffered long-term effects from a nightmare. If he woke on his own and saw her there, he might feel violated or ashamed.</p><p>His breathing came fast and shallow now. He ceased wrestling the pillow and flipped onto his back, his fists clenched at his sides. They were the size of millstones. His teeth were gritted, the tendons strained and bulging along his neck. A low, inhuman growl rumbled from his throat and forced its way through his teeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meredith\u2019s heart ached. She didn\u2019t know what form of agony he was enduring in that dream, but she knew she couldn\u2019t stand by and watch him suffer a moment longer. In her girlhood, she\u2019d been witness to his pain and never done a thing about it. There\u2019d been nothing she could have done, then. How exactly did a reedy waif of a servant\u2019s daughter protest the lord\u2019s maltreatment of his own son?</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t a girl any longer, and she could do something to ease Rhys\u2019s suffering now.</p><p>She crept to the bedside and crouched by his sleeping form. \u201cHush,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cHush. You\u2019re safe, Rhys. All is well.\u201d</p> <p>She forced her fingers to cease trembling and laid one hand to his shoulder. At his sharp wince, she almost withdrew the touch. But she kept shushing and soothing in quiet tones and simply kept her hand there, pressed lightly against his heated flesh, until the tension in his body released. When his fists uncurled at his sides and his breathing steadied, she withdrew her hand and began to breathe again herself.</p><p>For a quarter hour or more, she knelt there, watching him return to a peaceful slumber and allowing her own heart rate to slow.</p><p>He released a soft sigh in his sleep, one that melted her deep inside, and his lips curled in a little half-smile. She wondered if she was in the dream he was having now. She hoped so. He gave a little groan\u2014one that hinted at pleasure, not pain.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t resist any longer. Stealthily, she tugged at the folds of the bedclothes, drawing them loose from his midsection. And then she lifted the side of the sheet and bent her head to peek beneath.</p><p>No, no war injury. None that would inhibit his normal male function, at any rate. Whatever scars covered the rest of his body, these parts of him were healthy indeed. Perfect. As if his organ could sense her interest, it jerked for attention. Arousal rushed through her on the receding tide of anxiety. Just looking at him, she felt heat building in the hollows of her knees.</p> <p>He made a sudden movement, and she dropped the sheet. She pulled her gaze back up to his face just in time to watch his eyes snap open\u2014dark, intense, furious, dangerous. The hairs on the back of her neck lifted, and her heart battered her ribs. She had the suspicion a fair number of Napoleon\u2019s soldiers had witnessed this very same look in Rhys\u2019s eyes, and it was the last thing they\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s Meredith.\u201d</p><p>He blinked a few times. Comprehension drove the violence from his eyes. \u201cChrist,\u201d he muttered, sitting up on one elbow and rubbing a palm over his face, then over his shorn hair. \u201cYou surprised me. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Nothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d She almost laughed, remembering her reason for the visit. \u201cEverything is perfectly well. I\u2019m sorry to wake you, I just ... heard noises, and I was concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d With a glance at his exposed chest, he swore again. He shrugged to the far side of the bed, diving under the bed linens and jerking them up to his chin.</p><p>And now she did laugh. She couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cHave I offended your modesty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I\u2019m offending yours. I don\u2019t want to disgust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisgust me? How could that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other day. You asked me to put on a shirt.\u201d He drew the sheet tighter about his chest. \u201cI know it must look repulsive ... you know, with all the scars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Rhys.\u201d She buried her face in her hands for a moment, then removed them and decided to just be honest. \u201cI asked you to put on a shirt because you\u2019re the most distractingly attractive man I\u2019ve ever seen, and I could barely speak two words of sense for the sight of you. I don\u2019t find anything about you repulsive.\u201d</p><p>He blinked some more. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>She sat on the edge of the bed, in the empty space he\u2019d created by moving over. \u201cAs for scars ...\u201d She reached for the top of the bedsheet and pulled. He allowed the linen to slip from his grasp, and she drew it down to reveal his chest, marked by battles of various sorts. \u201cSurely you can\u2019t believe they\u2019re disgusting. Don\u2019t you know how women feel about scars, Rhys? Haven\u2019t your lovers been fascinated by them?\u201d</p> <p>His breathing grew thready as she drew a fingertip across his collarbone.</p><p>He said, \u201cThere haven\u2019t been any lovers. Not for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo long?\u201d Emotion rose in her throat. She swallowed hard, trying to keep her heart down in her chest where it belonged. Rhys was one of the most intensely sensual men she\u2019d ever known. She\u2019d sensed it even as a girl. It was what had drawn her to him, at an age where her own feelings of desire were just beginning to stir and coalesce. She\u2019d always been fascinated by him, but more than ever in her fourteenth summer. That year he\u2019d left for Eton an overgrown boy and returned a young man. She couldn\u2019t help but marvel at his wildness, his strength, his body\u2014these same broad shoulders she traced with her touch now. She let one fingertip wander the small valley carved between his shoulder muscle and his biceps.</p><p>What a grave injustice, that this beautiful man had been deprived of physical affection and pleasure for years. And yet, she could not deny the swell of possessive joy in her breast, to know he belonged to her in some sense. She would be his first, after so long. He would always remember her. She would make certain of that.</p><p>Flattening her hand, she swept a palm down his biceps, flipping her wrist to caress him with the backs of her fingers as she drew her hand back up.</p><p>\u201cMeredith ...\u201d There was a warning in his voice. But none of the strength coiled in these formidable muscles marshaled to push her away.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d she told him, stroking his arm again. \u201cLet me touch you.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed against the pillow, and his eyes fluttered closed.</p><p>Behind his eyelids, Rhys saw tulips. An endless field of red tulips, and a sky the brilliant blue of aquamarine. He\u2019d spied that field on a pleasant spring morn, marching through Holland with the Fifty-second. A light breeze had teased his hair ... almost as sweetly as Meredith now caressed his skin. That field of flowers had been the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever seen, so beautiful it made even his healed wounds ache. He\u2019d led his men straight through it, unable to resist. Striding through that field of a million cheery blossoms all facing the sun at his back, he\u2019d felt as though they were welcoming him into their midst. He waded knee-deep in that beauty, bathed in it\u2014as if it could wash away all the ugliness of war. This must be what heaven is like, he\u2019d thought. I\u2019d best look and breathe my fill of it now, because God knows I won\u2019t be enjoying it after I die.</p><p>It was only when he\u2019d halted and glanced over his shoulder that he\u2019d seen the truth: the piercing glint of a hundred bayonets stabbing the blue sky in unison. His entire battalion of bedraggled soldiers, crunching through the field, mowing down the tulips with boots and bloodied stumps of bare feet. He\u2019d been welcomed by the beauty of God\u2019s creation, and he was leaving grim destruction in his wake. Because he was a violent brute, and that was what he did.</p><p>Meredith\u2019s caress ... ah, this was pure heaven. And he knew the longer he allowed her to touch him thus, the further he was treading heedless into that pristine, alluring beauty, insensible of the damage he could cause. But he just couldn\u2019t bring himself to stop her. Not yet.</p><p>He kept his eyes closed. She swept her hand down his arm again, and arousal rushed through his body, gathering in his groin and clamoring for release.</p><p>\u201cWomen find a man\u2019s scars irresistible,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWe\u2019re drawn to them, to the mystery.\u201d Her fingers found the neat round entry wound where the ball had passed through his shoulder at Vitoria. She traced the puckered scar, pressed a thumb against it. A hint of humor lightened her voice. \u201cThink of ... think of nipples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNi\u2014\u201d Holy God. \u201cDid you say ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNipples. Aren\u2019t men hopelessly fascinated with a woman\u2019s nipples?\u201d</p><p>He could not have spoken for other men, but suddenly Rhys could think of little else.</p><p>She said, \u201cA man\u2019s scars are the same for us. We can\u2019t help but wonder about them, the color and texture. We long to explore them\u2014not just with fingers, but with lips.\u201d</p><p>Her lips grazed his shoulder, and his eyes flew open. A loose lock of her upswept hair brushed his chest as she kissed his old, healed wound. He wanted to catch that dark ribbon of hair in his fingertips, but he couldn\u2019t move. If he dared move, she might stop.</p><p>Don\u2019t stop. Don\u2019t stop.</p><p>She trailed warm kisses across his chest. Sweet, tender, feminine. And so damned erotic, he was already hard as a gun barrel and primed to fire.</p><p>Pressing one last kiss to the scar at his temple, she lifted her head and straightened. He couldn\u2019t have imagined the expression on his face, but the smile on hers told him she liked it.</p><p>His gaze slipped downward, and he realized suddenly that she wasn\u2019t even dressed. Her thin linen nightrail slid down one shoulder. The graceful contours of her throat and collarbone drew his eye downward still. He glimpsed her small, firm breasts swelling beneath the sheer fabric.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cLike nipples.\u201d</p><p>Her smile widened. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His fingers went to the ribbon tie at the neckline of her shift. Grasping one frail lace of satin, he undid the simple bow with a slow, agonizing pull. He let his hand fall back so he could enjoy how the fabric gaped to reveal a hint of flesh. Then she rolled her shoulder, and the muslin eased down to bare one breast.</p><p>He was stunned immobile for a moment, mesmerized by the milky perfection of her flesh and its rosy pink undertones. And by her lovely pert nipple, just a few shades darker than her skin. As he watched, her areola ruched and puckered, pushing her nipple into a tight bud. A bud that begged to be plucked, sucked.</p><p>A soft groan escaped him as he propped himself on one elbow and reached for her with his other hand. Her breast was so small and delicate, and his hand was so big and ugly\u2014if he cupped her, he wouldn\u2019t see anything of her at all. Where would be the good in that? Instead, he brushed the back of one fingertip along the underside of her breast. Her skin shivered and rippled into gooseflesh. He almost drew back, but her soft sigh of pleasure encouraged him. He stroked the place again, then drew a wide circle with his thumb, tracing the outer edge of her areola. She was the softest thing he\u2019d ever touched. His mouth watered.</p><p>As if she could sense his need, she leaned forward, meeting him halfway. \u201cYes,\u201d she urged. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a kiss to the underside of her breast, tasting her skin with a furtive swipe of his tongue. And it was paradise. The stuff of a laudanum dream. Pleasure so acute it verged on madness. The spicy-sweet scent of her skin intoxicated him. Against his mouth she was cool and perfect, like honeydew. And it was a very good thing he was going to marry her, because he knew from just this one first taste that he would never, ever get enough.</p><p>\u201cTake down your hair.\u201d He said it in an authoritative voice of command that really wasn\u2019t suited to use with his future wife, but damn\u2014he wanted her to obey, and he wasn\u2019t taking any chances asking nicely.</p><p>She did obey, hastily pulling free the ribbon that tied her plait. Her bared breast jounced deliciously as she unbraided her hair, then shook it free. Those thick locks tumbled about her shoulders and chest, dark and sensuous as sable. A curve of creamy skin, capped by her pale, taut nipple, peeked out through the fall of hair draping her breast.</p><p>Add in that flirtatious smile and the tender invitation in her eyes, and ... Jesus. Fields of tulips, aquamarine skies\u2014they had nothing on Meredith. She was the most beautiful, perfect thing he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>He sat up in bed. \u201cI should go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?

Take the morning to rest, enjoy yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI enjoy working on the house.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a coy look through lowered lashes. \u201cMore than you\u2019d enjoy me?\u201d</p><p>He scanned the room for his shirt and breeches. There they were, on a hook by the door. Damn it, why had he left them so far away? He nodded toward them. \u201cCould you be so good as to hand me my clothes?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo, I could not be so good. I\u2019m beginning to wonder why I\u2019m still wearing anything.\u201d</p><p>She moved to draw her chemise down the other shoulder. He covered his face with one hand and groaned into it, debating the wisdom of giving her exactly what she deserved and rising from bed naked, crude erection and all. Instead, he pulled the sheet free and wrapped it around his waist as he stood, throwing the tail over his shoulder so it draped like an ancient Greek\u2019s toga. It made him feel stately and philosophical, which helped in the battle to tamp down his lust.</p> <p>He crossed the room to dress. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to happen. Not this morning. I apologize for taking the liberties I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys,\u201d she said as he pulled the shirt over his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for apology. We\u2019re both adults. We want each other. There\u2019s no reason we shouldn\u2019t have some fun. It needn\u2019t mean anything more than that.\u201d</p><p>Whipping the sheet from his waist, he reached for his breeches and pulled them on with impatient tugs before turning to face her. \u201cMeredith. You\u2019re my future wife. When I make love to you for the first time, it is damn well going to mean something. To me, at least.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, obviously surprised. Dropping her gaze, she threaded her arms back through the sleeves of her shift and tied the ribbon with shaking fingers.</p><p>Rhys took a deep breath and composed himself. See? He was such a destructive brute. He\u2019d barely touched her, and he was hurting her already.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not angry.\u201d He grabbed his boots and sat on the opposite edge of the bed. \u201cI ... I\u2019m just not especially good with words. I want to explain this, but it may not come out right. Will you let me try?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged her acquiescence.</p><p>He began cramming his right foot into its boot. \u201cI\u2019ve torn apart a lot of things in my life. Too many. I\u2019ve been in the business of death for years now, and there\u2019s only one thing I\u2019ve never successfully managed to destroy. You\u2019re looking at it.\u201d He began on the left boot, working more slowly. His stiff knee made it tricky. \u201cThis body has survived blows, musket balls, bayonets, grenades, and whatever else God and Napoleon could find to hurl at it. I\u2019m simply fated to live. There\u2019s no other explanation. And now that I\u2019ve come to terms with that, I\u2019m done tearing things apart.\u201d</p><p>He plunked his booted feet on the floor and turned to face her. \u201cI want to build something now. Can you understand? Every day for years, I\u2019ve woken up thinking, this is the day I die, or kill trying. Now I wake up and think, this is the day I start mixing the cob. I\u2019m working myself to bones out there on the moor, sweating and piling rocks and digging in the dirt. Each morning I\u2019m greeted by new aches and pains, heaped atop a lifetime of injuries. But it\u2019s all worth it. I\u2019m going to build that house with my own hands, from the foundation to the roof. I\u2019m going to do it for us, and I\u2019m going to do it right, so it lasts forever. Can\u2019t go raising walls on a shaky foundation. Can\u2019t go slapping thatch over rafters so thin, they\u2019ll topple with the first winter storm. Do you know?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with us. I mean to build something with you. Something that will last. Much as I want you, I don\u2019t want to rush and bollocks it up. We\u2019re meant to be together, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I know you don\u2019t believe that yet.\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll keep building\u2014stone by stone, plank by plank, kiss by kiss\u2014until you do. And yes, I\u2019ll wake up stiff and aching for you each morning. But it\u2019s worth it.\u201d He reached out and tilted her face to his. \u201cYou\u2019re worth it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went wide. \u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>He stood and reached for his waistcoat. \u201cWhat I am is indestructible. And I\u2019m not going anywhere, Meredith. You\u2019re stuck with me now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cHere you are. Coddled eggs and toast.\u201d Meredith laid the plate in front of her father. He frowned at it. \u201cThought I asked for fried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d She propped her hands on the waistline of her green serge skirt and stared at the plate. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting old, Merry. But not so old I can\u2019t remember what I said five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>She plunked the salt down in front of him. \u201cJust eat them. Eggs are eggs.\u201d</p><p>His bushy eyebrows rose as he lifted his coffee. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you this morning? You\u2019re not your usual self.\u201d</p><p>No. No, she wasn\u2019t. What a morning. Thank goodness Rhys hadn\u2019t shown his face for breakfast. She wouldn\u2019t have known what to say to him. And considering her state of distraction, she probably would have served him burnt porridge with a side of soap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Father.\u201d She moved back to the stove and cracked two eggs into a buttered pan. \u201cI\u2019m just a little tired, that\u2019s all. Perhaps I\u2019m not sleeping enough of late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t slept enough in years, Merry. You\u2019re always working yourself too hard. Things will improve, now that Rhys is back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not engaged to Rhys.\u201d Just how many times would she be forced to say those words before someone believed them?</p><p>\u201cEven if you aren\u2019t. He\u2019ll give me a post, and I can support you for a change. The way it should be. You can rest.\u201d</p><p>Meredith shook her head. As if she would allow her crippled, aged father to perform manual labor while she sat idly by. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rest. I want to keep my inn.\u201d</p><p>Rhys had truly moved her earlier, with his little speech about building the house, and constructing it to last. The excitement shining in his eyes had been wonderful to see. She understood just what he meant, because she felt the same way about the Three Hounds. No, she hadn\u2019t built it from the ground up, but she\u2019d worked herself not just to the bone, but to the marrow to make the inn what it was today. She was damned proud of it, too.</p><p>This place represented independence, security, friendship, personal satisfaction ... a home. Everything she\u2019d ever wanted in her life, save one thing.</p><p>Rhys St. Maur.</p><p>And now, miracle of miracles, it seemed that Rhys wanted her, too. But only if she agreed to marry him. Only if she gave up the inn.</p><p>He simply didn\u2019t understand. Her responsibilities extended beyond caring for her father. The Three Hounds was the financial and social heart of the village. Everyone in Buckleigh-in-the-Moor depended on it, and depended on her to manage it.</p><p>She slid the fried eggs onto a plate, then placed it in front of her father, switching out the coddled ones for herself. After pouring herself a mug of coffee, she sat down across from him. For a few minutes, they ate in silence.</p><p>When the eggs had fortified her sufficiently and she felt up to addressing the subject, she said, \u201cFather, listen to me. Please don\u2019t get carried away with wild ideas. We can\u2019t be sure Rhys is here to stay. He\u2019s a gentleman having a lark pushing stones about the countryside. When the amusement wears off, what then? He may decide his \u2018fate\u2019 lies elsewhere and leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d She lowered her voice and tried again. \u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed, Father? Everyone who can leave this place, does.\u201d</p><p>His brow creased. \u201cWhen did you become so jaded, Merry?\u201d</p><p>Ten years ago. When I married a man several years your senior, just to put a roof over our heads.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jaded. I\u2019m being realistic. Someone has to be.\u201d Unfortunately, it seemed that someone must always be her. It certainly wouldn\u2019t be Rhys, with his strange insistence on destiny. Would fate get the laundry done?</p><p>She pushed back from the table. \u201cMrs. Ware will look after anything else you need. I\u2019d best gather the linens for Betsy.\u201d</p><p>She went upstairs and gathered the bedclothes from each room, beginning with her own cramped, simple quarters, and continuing to her father\u2019s slightly larger room, then proceeding through every guest room, whether they had been occupied in the past week or not. Meredith knew that people of means typically traveled with their own sheets, but she made it a point to dress the beds in clean linens, as a matter of aesthetics and pride.</p><p>She saved Rhys\u2019s bedchamber for last, telling herself to invade the unoccupied room, whisk the sheets from the mattress, and make a quick retreat. But of course, the corner of one sheet snagged on the bedpost, and she had to climb atop the mattress to tug at it ... and deuce it, the sheets were pitifully clean, when by all rights they should have been marked with passion.</p><p>And she was so very tired.</p><p>For a moment, she contemplated flopping onto the bed, snuggling into what lingered of his spicy male scent, and taking a long, luxuriant rest. She could all too easily imagine him lying next to her. She had a fair amount of practice imagining that. Except now, she had the benefit of much more information. She knew how his body fit against hers, solid in every place she was soft. She knew how his skin felt to the touch\u2014weathered and sun-warmed atop his forearm, supple as kid on the inner side of his wrist.</p><p>She knew the taste of his kiss.</p><p>Oh, Rhys.</p><p>With a sharp yank, Meredith pulled the stubborn sheet free and roused herself from her fantasy. She understood dreams, sometimes even reveled in them. She wasn\u2019t jaded, like her father had suggested. But she knew where to draw the boundary between dreams and reality.</p><p>The familiar titter of the washerwoman\u2019s laughter floated up from the courtyard. Meredith tied the dirty linens in a bundle and went to the window, calling to catch Betsy\u2019s attention. She stuffed the heap of linen through the window, and Betsy swooped quick to catch it in her basket\u2014a move that earned her appreciative calls from a few of the men nearby.</p><p>\u201cExcellent aim, Mrs. Maddox!\u201d Darryl waved to her from the stables. The hounds yipped and wrestled at his feet.</p><p>Meredith smiled in return, but didn\u2019t linger to join the fun. Instead she left the window to hurry downstairs. She\u2019d caught sight of Robbie Brown rolling into the courtyard with his wheelbarrow of peat for the fires. She\u2019d need to assemble his payment in coin and bread. After that, she\u2019d speak with Mrs. Ware about the day\u2019s meals, depending on what sort of meat the Farrell boys brought in.</p><p>She had an inn to run and a village to support.</p><p>When she entered the public room, she found it near full already, despite the early hour. A few travelers were taking a light meal before continuing on their journey. Village men were meeting over coffee to gossip and discuss trade. Even Harry and Laurence were here, eating breakfast.</p><p>She stopped in her tracks. What were the Symmonds boys doing here? The two of them never saw this side of noon, unless they\u2019d been up all night keeping watch for Gideon. And last night, she hadn\u2019t even needed to chase them out at closing time. They\u2019d gone home unusually peaceably, at the early hour of half-ten.</p><p>\u201cRough night, boys?\u201d Hands propped on her hips, she approached their table.</p><p>Harry looked up from a plate laden with eggs, bacon, rolls and jam. \u201cSuppose you could say that.\u201d He exchanged glances with Larry, and the two began chuckling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Their laughter was echoed from a few other tables. Meredith slowly pivoted, taking the measure of her clientele. Now that she noticed it, a fair number of these men never darkened her door before midday.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked sternly. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>The laughter only grew.</p> <p>\u201cRough night indeed, Mrs. Maddox,\u201d Larry said around a mouthful of eggs. \u201cBut the rough morning ... now that belongs to your friend Ashworth.\u201d</p><p>Dread seeped through her limbs. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Her voice shook a little, and she firmed her jaw to compensate. \u201cHarold and Laurence Symmonds, tell me this instant. What have you done to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, Mrs. Maddox,\u201d Skinner said from the next table over. He winked at her over his coffee. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hurt the man none.\u201d</p><p>Harry muttered, \u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>The room broke into laughter again, but Meredith didn\u2019t wait to sort it out. With a hasty word to Mrs. Ware as she passed through the kitchen, she tore out the back door of the inn and made a straight path up the rocky slope\u2014the most direct route to the ruins of Nethermoor. If Rhys had hired the ponies, he would have to lead them up the circuitous footpath. Perhaps she could beat him there and intercept whatever unpleasant surprise Harold, Laurence, and the others had planned for him. How long had it been since he\u2019d left that morning? An hour, perhaps? She would have to hurry.</p> <p>After twenty minutes of hard walking and scrambling over uneven ground, she reached Bell Tor and skirted the ancient stacks of granite. Despite the warming sunlight, she shivered as she neared the ruins of Nethermoor Hall. Just over this crest was the flat where Rhys was building his cottage. Panting for breath and clutching her side, she climbed up those last few steep, rocky yards ...</p><p>And found heartbreak waiting for her on the other side.</p><p>A half-dozen dappled ponies roamed the shallow depression, grazing happily on sedge and gorse. Their unloaded burdens of straw were stacked neatly in a pile, ready to be mixed with earth. And the foundation of Rhys\u2019s cottage\u2014the stones he\u2019d spent a week hauling from the surrounding area and painstakingly fitting together to form a level, unshakable plinth\u2014completely destroyed. Scattered to all corners of the moor.</p><p>Her heart twisted in her chest. So hard, she forgot all about the cramp in her side.</p><p>Rhys was there, stripped down to his shirt and breeches, clearing the area. Methodically picking up the stones one by one, then sorting them into piles by size. Preparing to build it all again.</p><p>She watched him in silence for a few minutes. When she approached, she could tell he sensed her presence. He didn\u2019t greet her, however. He refused to meet her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Rhys. I\u2019m ...\u201d Her voice caught. Really, what could she say? \u201cI\u2019m so sorry this happened. I know you put so much work into it.\u201d</p><p>So much work, and so much heart.</p><p>He gave a diffident shrug as he kept right on working. \u201cI was worried I\u2019d made the thing too small, anyhow. Now I can enlarge it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat good would it do to get angry?\u201d With a low grunt, he plucked a small boulder from the ground.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it would do any good, but it would certainly be natural.\u201d</p><p>He tossed the stone aside easily, as though it were an apple core. It landed with a resounding thud. \u201cI\u2019ve wasted most of my life being angry. Never changes a damn thing. I just end up hurting everything around me.\u201d</p><p>Meredith hurt for him. She watched as he continued clearing and sorting the stones. His motions were brutish, and barely controlled. It couldn\u2019t be healthy for him, holding his emotions in like that. If his unleashed anger inflicted damage on everything around him, what damage was it doing to him, when he kept it inside?</p> <p>\u201cRhys ...\u201d</p><p>With a rock balanced in either hand, he strode over to confront her. His eyes burned into hers. \u201cTell me one thing.\u201d</p><p>She mutely nodded her acquiescence. As if she could refuse.</p><p>\u201cDid you know they were planning this? Is that why you came to my room this morning, tried to keep me in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cGod, no.\u201d Of all the horrid notions ... no wonder he couldn\u2019t bear to look at her. \u201cRhys, it wasn\u2019t like that. I had no idea. You must believe me.\u201d</p><p>With a rough sigh, he heaved the rocks aside. First one, then the other. \u201cI believe you. Just had to ask.\u201d</p><p>Before he could turn away, she caught his wrist. \u201cStop for a moment. Please?\u201d</p><p>He stopped.</p><p>The wind gusted, tangling her skirt around her legs and forcing her to raise her voice. \u201cI had no idea they\u2019d do this last night, but I suspected they\u2019d try something soon. You must understand, they\u2019re concerned. I\u2019m concerned, too. I heard what you told me earlier, about needing to build something here. And I understand, more than you could know. To you, this rebuilding plan is some kind of redemption, but to everyone in the village ... it\u2019s a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA threat? How can it be a threat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve built a livelihood here, just barely. Mainly due to the inn, and Darryl\u2019s little business touring the travelers, and ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Gideon Myles\u2019s smuggling ring.\u201d</p><p>Her voice failed her. He knew about Gideon?</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. Myles and I had a not-quite-friendly chat just before he left town last week. Just how involved are you with that business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d She swallowed hard. What use was there denying it? \u201cNot very.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a queer look as he backed away, returning to his pile of stones. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d hoped. But this morning made me wonder.\u201d</p><p>A queasy feeling churned her innards. She recognized it as guilt. And why should she feel guilty, simply because she\u2019d done whatever she could to ensure the village\u2019s survival?</p><p>\u201cRhys, try to understand. Our livelihood as a village ... it\u2019s a delicate balance, and you\u2019re threatening to topple it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTopple it? I want to rebuild it, on something more solid than ghost stories and smuggled brandy. My ancestors supported this village for generations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but this generation doesn\u2019t understand. There\u2019s already a betting pool down at the tavern. The men are all laying wagers on how long it\u2019ll take you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d His voice went dark. \u201cWhat date is your money on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a gambler,\u201d she said, hoping a little smile would lighten the mood. \u201cYou\u2019ve been gone for so long. It\u2019s hard for people to believe you\u2019re serious when you say you\u2019re here to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what else I can do to convince people\u201d\u2014his pointed look told her he meant the one particular person standing before him\u2014\u201cthat I\u2019m truly here to stay. Other than to stay. And keep building up these stones, no matter how many times they knock them down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou truly mean that? No matter what they do, you\u2019ll remain here on the moor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a damned boulder.\u201d An ironic smile quirked his lips. He ran a hand over his hair, then wiped his brow with his sleeve. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way. It\u2019s not like I have something better to do.\u201d</p><p>Was that meant to reassure her? It didn\u2019t. Perhaps it helped convince her he wasn\u2019t leaving anytime soon, but it certainly didn\u2019t make her any more inclined to marry him.</p><p>Marry me, Meredith. It\u2019s not like I have something better to do.</p><p>\u201cJust the same,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d rather not rebuild this foundation a dozen times. I suppose I\u2019ll start camping out here to guard it. You\u2019ve need of your guest rooms anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut here? At night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a soldier. I\u2019ve camped in worse conditions than these.\u201d He looked around the rubble. \u201cMuch worse.\u201d</p><p>Her gut told her he wasn\u2019t exaggerating. But even if he could endure it, she hated the thought of him staying out here in the cold when she had warm beds and hot food at the inn. Not to mention, the open moor was dangerous at night. Dark, damp, perilous. In protecting the cottage, he\u2019d only be endangering himself. Next time Gideon\u2019s supporters got up to their mischief, the house wouldn\u2019t be their target. Rhys would.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be another way,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. If there is, I\u2019m certain you\u2019ll think of it. You\u2019re cleverer than I am.\u201d</p><p>And with that he went back to work, lifting stone after stone. He began to arrange some of them into a line.</p><p>With a defeated sigh, Meredith sat down on one of the largest boulders. She didn\u2019t feel up to walking back just yet. She was fatigued and frustrated and boiling angry on Rhys\u2019s behalf. Those Symmonds boys had better have cleared out by the time she returned, or she\u2019d be breaking bottles over both their heads.</p><p>For the moment, she simply sat and watched Rhys, and the controlled wrath in his movements as he hefted and slung the rocks from one place to the other. Beneath his shirt, his muscles bulged and flexed. His face was a mask of grim determination. When stone cracked against stone, Meredith felt the echo reverberate in her spine, but he didn\u2019t even flinch.</p><p>What must it be like, to possess that kind of power? If only she had the strength to build walls with her own two hands ... She\u2019d have already built her new guest wing for the inn.</p><p>An idea began to form in her mind.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re building with cob,\u201d she said thoughtfully, \u201cthere\u2019s a great deal of waiting involved. You have to build it in rises, you know. So the walls don\u2019t buckle or crack. Just a few feet of height at a time, and you\u2019ll need to let the walls settle between each rise. A week, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain I\u2019ll find ways to keep myself busy hereabouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. But the ideal would be to have two buildings going up at the same time. While one rests, you add a layer of cob to the other. And the reverse.\u201d</p><p>He propped one boot on a stone and looked up at her. \u201cAre you saying I should build two cottages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She leaned forward, suddenly excited at the brilliance of the scheme. \u201cI\u2019m saying we should become partners.\u201d</p><p>One eyebrow rose. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what I\u2019ve been suggesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness partners, not ...\u201d Her hands fluttered. \u201cJust hear me out.\u201d</p><p>Purposely mute, he made an expansive gesture of invitation.</p><p>\u201cYou want to build your cottage, but you don\u2019t have laborers. I want to add on to my inn, but I lack the funds. We\u2019ll work together and build both at the same time.\u201d She rose from her stone perch and began pacing back and forth. \u201cI\u2019ll convince the men to work for us, and I\u2019ll provide all their meals during construction. You\u2019ll pay the wages and material costs. Once they\u2019ve completed a rise on one building, they\u2019ll switch to the other while it settles and cures.\u201d</p><p>He scratched his neck and peered toward the horizon. \u201cWhat\u2019s the advantage to me, financing an addition to the inn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gesture of good will.\u201d She ceased pacing and went to stand before him. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? The villagers are afraid you\u2019re going to disrupt their lives with these plans to rebuild Nethermoor Hall, and then leave them in worse straits than ever. If they see the improvements to the inn occurring at the same time ... well, they won\u2019t worry so much. No matter what happens with you and your house, Buckleigh-in-the-Moor will have come out for the better. And if the two of us are working together, they\u2019ll stop fighting you every step of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey?\u201d He cocked his head and looked her up and down. \u201cAm I truly to do this because \u2018they\u2019 won\u2019t worry so much? Or are we talking about you and your own concerns?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She inhaled slowly. \u201cI ... I don\u2019t know. Both, I suppose. Does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d He studied the grit under his fingernails.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Rhys.\u201d The wind whipped a strand of hair into her mouth, and she drew it back with one hand. \u201cEither way, it\u2019s going to take you just as long to build a cottage. But if you\u2019ll allow me, I think I can persuade the local men\u201d\u2014and Gideon too, if she played it just right\u2014\u201cto give you a chance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou really think they\u2019ll take work with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I approach them about it? Yes. This village is more than those dozen brutes who camp out in the tavern each night. There are several cottagers in the area scraping out a living from the moor, supporting families, many of whom have been here since your father\u2019s day. They\u2019d jump at an offer of work, if it\u2019s presented favorably.\u201d</p><p>He released a deep sigh. \u201cVery well, then. You have me convinced. We\u2019re partners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness partners.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply\u2014just gave her a knowing half-smile and stuck his big, powerful hand into the gap between them.</p> <p>Meredith did the same, and they shook hands in a brisk, very businesslike manner. And then, for an extended moment, neither one of them let go.</p><p>\u201cWalk with me,\u201d she heard herself say, in an embarrassingly wistful tone. When his chin ducked in surprise, she released his hand and continued, \u201cI mean ... I\u2019ll see about assembling a workforce tomorrow. For today, why don\u2019t you rest? Walk back down to the village with me. We\u2019ll take the long way, along the stream. It\u2019s a fine day for a walk, and it will give us a chance to talk.\u201d She added swiftly, \u201cAbout the construction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of the ponies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send Darryl for them later. They\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, he wiped his hands on his breeches and picked up his coat where it lay nearby. Slinging it over his arm, he said, \u201cAll right, then. Lead the way.\u201d</p><p>She set an unhurried pace across the ridge, and he followed.</p> <p>\u201cMind the path,\u201d she told him, guiding him around the edge of the bog. He\u2019d been away so long, she worried he might forget where to step. On the surface, it merely looked like a patch of damp land, dotted with scrubby patches of heather. However, beneath the unthreatening wreath of loam lay a spring\u2014the source of the stream that flowed down these slopes and straight through the heart of Buckleigh-in-the-Moor. Peat and muck covered the spring two yards deep, and this bog was the sad end of many an unsuspecting creature with the bad fortune to misstep and become mired.</p><p>As they turned down the slope, the waters gathered and funneled into a steady trickle, draining the layers of surrounding peat. The ground was firm and safer now, and they walked two abreast as they followed the winding, ever-widening stream.</p><p>From his easy gait, Meredith could sense that much of the angry tension in his body had dissipated. Good. Back at the cottage site, he\u2019d been so tightly wound and obviously hurting, she\u2019d been afraid for him. Or afraid for the rocks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been years since I walked this way,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it looks the same as it ever did. Has it changed any, in your view?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe landscape? No.\u201d He gave her a playful look. \u201cBut my companion\u2019s a damn sight lovelier than before.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks blazed with a blush so fierce not even the cool breeze off the stream could soothe it. To say her adolescence was awkward rather understated the matter, but still ... it burned her pride to know he remembered. \u201cI know, I know. Back then, I was all freckles and bone.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou were, but that\u2019s not what I meant. Even freckles and bone, I\u2019m certain you were lovelier than my horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Different companion. Yes, I see.\u201d To disguise her embarrassment, she forced a laugh. \u201cBut that was a beautiful horse. My father still reminisces about that gelding. Finest beast he ever kept, he says.\u201d</p> <p>Rhys lapsed into silence.</p><p>Meredith breathed with relief. It seemed her secret was safe, then. She\u2019d followed him along this route many times as a girl, always taking great pains to remain hidden from view. It hadn\u2019t been too difficult\u2014she\u2019d been a reedy little thing with wild hair, always dressed in faded homespun. She\u2019d likely blended right into the moor like a clump of gorse.</p><p>Even as they followed the path, she measured the distance by the old landmarks that had been her hiding places. The boulder standing sentinel atop a crest, the bowl-shaped depression where the river took a sharp curve, the twisted hawthorn tree surrounded by heather in its full violet bloom.</p><p>Skylarks spiraled in the sky above them. The further they walked, the closer they drew to a destination familiar to them both: the waterfall that tumbled into a steep gorge, gathering in a secluded pool beneath. That pool had been Rhys\u2019s escape in his youth, during his breaks from school. Meredith\u2019s escape, too, though little he knew it. She\u2019d followed him many a summer afternoon, watching in secret while he stripped bare and plunged into the cool, clear water. At the time, the pull had been youthful infatuation and simple curiosity. But she\u2019d grown into a woman since those days. As they drew nearer to that hidden pool, true desire swirled and eddied in her blood.</p><p>\u201cEnough about me,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me more about you.\u201d</p><p>This was a new development, too. Logically, a vigorous young man on the brink of seventeen had taken no interest in a spindly, underdeveloped pest of a girl. But Rhys noticed her now. As they walked, he asked her questions about her father, the inn, her life over the past fourteen years. Meredith wasn\u2019t used to talking about herself. While tending bar, she was always the one listening. She would have thought there little to tell, but nerves loosened her tongue, and somehow she found plenty to rattle on about. Rhys walked beside her, silent and attentive, taking care of her in small ways. Steering her around a rock, helping her over the crossing when the first bank grew too steep to navigate.</p><p>\u201cAnd Maddox?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat of him?\u201d</p><p>He kicked a small stone out of their path. \u201cHow did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I come to marry him, you mean?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAfter the ...\u201d She paused, then decided there was no use talking around it. \u201cAfter the fire, my father\u2019s convalescence was prolonged. For several years, the Ashworth estate paid him a pension. I took care of Father, and we lived well enough on the annual amount. But then the money stopped coming, around the same time the vicar\u2019s living dried up. I was eighteen and frantic. I didn\u2019t know what to do, but I needed to find some way of bringing in food, or we\u2019d starve.\u201d</p><p>Meredith didn\u2019t like remembering those desperate times. A lump formed in her throat, like congealed porridge\u2014which was what they\u2019d eaten, sometimes twice a day. In her distraction, she neglected to choose her steps carefully. Her foot landed awkwardly on the path, and she stumbled.</p><p>Rhys\u2019s hand shot out to grip her elbow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d she told him, steadying herself. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t release her arm, however. Rather, he slid his hand down to capture hers. When she gave him an inquiring look, he merely said, \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>So they walked on hand-in-hand, wading through a bank of ferns. The whole moor greened up around the stream, and the banks were saturated with rich color, slick with moss. The fertile aroma of wet earth clung heavy here, too strong for even the wind to scrub away.</p><p>\u201cI went to Maddox,\u201d she said, \u201cto offer my services as a groom in the stables. I knew how to do a stablehand\u2019s work, of course. You know I practically grew up in the Nethermoor stables, and Father taught me everything. To show Maddox I could do a man\u2019s work, I went dressed in men\u2019s clothing\u2014breeches, boots.\u201d</p><p>Rhys chuckled. \u201cAnd how did that work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as I\u2019d hoped.\u201d She smiled to herself, remembering the way Maddox had searched her appearance with those rheumy blue eyes of his. As though he were mentally sifting through decades\u2019 worth of life as a male, trying to recall the perspective of a virile man in his prime.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t take me on as a stablehand,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut he offered me a post as a barmaid. Thought my pretty face would help sell pints.\u201d Perhaps she should have been offended, but she hadn\u2019t been. For the first time, she\u2019d tasted the power inherent in womanhood. She recalled it had felt oddly gratifying, to find some use for the slight breasts and hips she\u2019d been growing.</p><p>\u201cAnd ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told him I\u2019d rather not be a barmaid, but I\u2019d marry him if he liked.\u201d</p><p>Rhys coughed. \u201cYou proposed to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered, matter-of-factly. \u201cFather and I needed more security than a barmaid\u2019s wages would provide. And I\u2019ve never regretted it. Maddox was kind to me, and I was a help to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when he died, he left you the inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did. And in the six years since, I\u2019ve made the inn my own. In the end, it worked out well for everyone.\u201d</p><p>They heard the falls before the ridge came into view. Meredith felt it as much as she heard it: the low, dramatic rush of sound. This was not the trickling melody of the stream, but rather its ominous percussion. The sound of water forced to a crisis, hurtling into the unknown.</p><p>Rhys made a contemplative noise. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s fate for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFate?\u201d Meredith laughed. \u201cYou sound like the old moorfolk, so superstitious. How can you believe in that nonsense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I not? Do you think it\u2019s all just random, then? No rhyme or reason to the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I believe in hard work and hard choices. I believe people reap what they sow.\u201d</p><p>They came to a halt as they neared the falls. The drop was so steep and unexpected. From their vantage upstream, it looked as though the stream simply hit a wall of glass. Still holding hands, they advanced onto the rocky outcropping that bordered the falls.</p><p>\u201cLooks much as I remember it,\u201d he said, peering down over the edge.</p><p>Edging forward until her toes met the lip of stone, Meredith followed his gaze. The water plummeted straight down, pounding into a circular pool some ten feet below. A lush oasis of greenery encircled the water\u2014trees, shrubs, ferns. Leafy branches hung over the pool, shading all but the center, where a round column of sunlight pierced the darkness.</p><p>Even in full daylight ... even to a woman nearing thirty, with a dozen menial tasks awaiting her at home and precious little energy for fancies ... it looked enchanted. This pool was like a sparkling, precious gem, sewn into the seam of the earth\u2019s foundation garments. From her girlhood, the sight had never failed to stir Meredith\u2019s imagination and emotions. Her heart began to beat a little faster.</p><p>Rhys seemed affected by the beauty, too. His voice became husky. \u201cYou say you believe people reap what they sow?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, look at this place,\u201d he said, gesturing down at the secluded pool. He turned to her, raising his free hand to cradle her cheek. \u201cLook at you.\u201d</p><p>Before she could protest the utter impossibility of his directive, he dropped a light kiss on her lips. Then another.</p><p>When he spoke again, his voice came from somewhere deep. Well hidden. \u201cThis very moment has to be the work of fate. Because I swear to you, there\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve done in my life to deserve it.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, and she clung to him, dizzied by the height of the drop, and the pounding of the falls, and the soft, delicious heat of his lips on hers. How did he do this to her? She\u2019d been mad for him as a girl, but she\u2019d chalked that up to youthful infatuation. She\u2019d tracked the events of his life religiously for a decade, but she\u2019d told herself that was idle curiosity. And now ... now she desired him so much she could scarcely stand, but surely that was only lust. Wasn\u2019t it? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as fate, Rhys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re mine. And I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>Her world started to spin. She pulled away from his embrace. \u201cYou can\u2019t honestly claim to live by such a belief. Just waiting to see what destiny brings?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged, picking up a pebble at his feet and lobbing it into the pool. \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve learned, over the course of my life. Fate is fate. Things will happen the way they\u2019re meant to happen. It\u2019s pointless to resist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPointless?\u201d</p><p>Meredith blinked at him. His argument was starting to chafe her pride. She didn\u2019t appreciate the insinuation that all her work and sacrifice over the past ten years had been pointless. That no matter whether she\u2019d married an arthritic innkeeper or spent her days foraging for roots and slugs, she would still be standing here, with Rhys, at this moment. She wanted him to recognize the effort she\u2019d made to hold this village together. Not only recognize it, but respect it. And she wanted him to see that he could make his own fate anywhere. With his strength, determination, rank, and wealth, he could have so much more than the rural life he envisioned in this place.</p><p>Somehow, she needed to shock him out of this blind, persistent belief in destiny.</p><p>She cast a brief glance sideways, over the edge of the outcropping. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s my destiny to fall into that pool.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s ridiculous about it? You said yourself, if it\u2019s meant to happen, it will happen. I\u2019ll fall into that pool. And what then?\u201d</p><p>He retreated a pace, running a hand through his hair. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat then, Rhys?\u201d Her eyebrows rose. So did her voice. \u201cShould I just be still and wait for my destiny? Would you just sit back and wait to see if I\u2019m fated to drown?\u201d She inched away from him, closer to the edge. \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s pointless to resist.\u201d</p><p>Recognition flashed in his eyes. \u201cMerry Lane, don\u2019t you dare\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFate is fate,\u201d she said.</p> <p>And then she took a large, retreating step ... into nothing.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Meredith wasn\u2019t there anymore. Rhys\u2019s bones weren\u2019t, either.</p><p>And what he rationally knew must have passed in an instant, seemed a bloody eternity. An eternity during which, of all absurd things, he found himself pondering science.</p><p>He\u2019d never understand the principle of gravity. How was it that his heart soared into his throat, at the same time the earth was tugging her body down?</p><p>For that matter, the earth was taking its damn sweet time with the tugging.</p><p>Splash.</p><p>Finally. Oh, thank God. Splash was good. Splash was much, much better than thud. Or crack.</p> <p>He was jarred into motion. Maddeningly, his first motion was to sink to his knees with relief. But a half-second later, he\u2019d scrambled to the edge of the overhang and stuck his head over, scanning for a glimpse of her in the darkened pool. If she\u2019d drifted left, been caught beneath the falls ... she\u2019d be churned and tumbled by the force of the cascade, with no escape.</p><p>But no. He caught sight of her to the right. The light fabric of her dress billowed beneath the clear surface, like the reflection of a cloud. She\u2019d been spared the rocks and falls. But the pool was deep there.</p><p>Damn teasing woman. She knew how to swim.</p><p>Didn\u2019t she?</p><p>Without tearing his eyes from the pool, he tossed his coat aside and began yanking at his boots. Surely any moment now he\u2019d see her break through the surface. She\u2019d smile up at him, taunting and triumphant, those silver eyes flashing like flints.</p><p>Any moment now.</p><p>\u201cMeredith,\u201d he bellowed, pulling his right boot free. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. You\u2019ve made your point. It isn\u2019t funny.\u201d He faltered with the left boot. Damn stiff knee always made it harder. Still she didn\u2019t surface. Perhaps she was tangled in weeds. Or maybe she\u2019d hit her head on the way down.</p><p>He wanted to curse, but he didn\u2019t. No breath to waste. By the time he finally had off with both boots, exertion and panic were driving the air from his lungs. With a ragged gulp to refill them, he dove after her.</p><p>The cold smacked him first. Then the wet seeped in. He fought the impulse to flail about the surface, instead letting the weight of his body pull him deeper.</p><p>Into the dark.</p><p>He opened his eyes to the stinging water, straining to make sense of the murky shadows. With Herculean effort, he forced himself to be still and turn a slow circle in place.</p><p>Rocks.</p><p>More rocks.</p><p>Shaft of sunlight, bubbles from the falls.</p><p>Empty darkness.</p><p>Meredith.</p><p>In one stroke, he was at her side. Throwing an arm about her waist, he powered their way up with the other, until they broke the water\u2019s glassy surface from beneath. From her first splash to their surfacing, the entire ordeal had probably lasted thirty seconds. Rhys felt like thirty years had been added to his age.</p><p>Kicking fiercely, he pushed them to the pool\u2019s edge, where it was shallow enough for him to stand. He set Meredith on a boulder submerged just below the water\u2019s surface, cradling her head and shoulders in his arms while the water did what it would with her billowing dress.</p><p>She did not move. Her eyes were closed.</p><p>Sputtering, he pushed the hair back from her face and bent his head to check for breath. Warmth puffed against his cheek.</p><p>\u201cMeredith.\u201d He gave her a shake. \u201cMeredith, wake up.\u201d</p><p>Some vestige of his battle mentality asserted itself. There was once a time when he\u2019d been cool and collected in such situations. He checked her for obvious signs of injury, looking in vain for signs of swelling or blood.</p><p>When that yielded no discoveries, he resorted to frantic shaking again. \u201cJesus, Meredith. Don\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open. Straightening her arms, she brought herself to a sitting position on the boulder. Her legs dangled free in the water.</p><p>A faint smile nudged the corners of her lips. \u201cIf that was a test of faith,\u201d she said evenly, \u201cI think you failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ... You ...\u201d Rhys shook a finger at her. \u201cDamn it, you know that was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFate?\u201d</p><p>And now he swore. Violently, crudely, punching at the water as he did. Rhys knew anger. He\u2019d lived angry, to one degree or another, nearly all his years. But never before had he felt so enraged and so relieved in equal measures. The combination was so dizzying, so confusing ... he couldn\u2019t even speak, or think.</p><p>Only act.</p><p>When she laughed at his rage, he wedged between her floating legs, pulled her lithe form flush against his angry bulk, and quieted her mouth with his own. No tenderness. No caution. Just raw emotion and need.</p><p>Now then, Merry Lane, he thought as he drove her jaw wide and made his best attempt at possessing her with his lips and tongue and teeth, just you try to laugh at this.</p><p>She didn\u2019t laugh. No, she moaned with pleasure and clutched him to her shivering body. Gave back as good as she received, catching his tongue and pulling him deeper into the kiss. They battled with lips and teeth, each working to persuade the other. Eventually the argument slowed, deepened, became more of a thoughtful discussion, and then ... and then, delicious accord. They moved in a rhythm, his tongue stroking hers, and she clung to him, throwing her arms around his neck and wrapping her legs around his hips. They fit together so perfectly, as though they\u2019d been fashioned just for this. Even she couldn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>He let her up for a quick breath, as a test.</p><p>\u201cRhys,\u201d she breathed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>And then he kissed her again, triumph surging through his body and centering in his groin. He was hopeless with words, couldn\u2019t sing worth a damn. Even the way he ate his food sent women fleeing. But when he kissed her, she went pliant in his arms. This mouth was good for something.</p><p>Their garments were soaked through, matted to their skin. He could feel every contour of her body, every rib and nipple and fingertip. And by the way she ground her pelvis against his, he assumed she could feel every hardened ridge of his. Despite the coolness of the water, heat smoldered between their bodies. Her thin muslin skirt and petticoat swirled around them on the water\u2019s surface, leaving her bared beneath.</p><p>Her leg twined around his, and he thrust his hand under the water to grip her thigh. Encouraged by her soft moan, he slid his palm up the underside of her leg and cupped her backside. And once he\u2019d gone that far ... he couldn\u2019t stop himself. He reached between her thighs to touch her sex.</p><p>Their kiss slowed now. He took his time, exploring her mouth gently with his tongue. Tracing her folds lightly with his fingertips. She shifted in his arms, giving him freer access, and he slid a finger inside her heat.</p><p>God, more mysteries of science. How could she possibly be wetter than water? But she was. Wet, warm, slippery, inviting. For him.</p><p>For him.</p><p>Gasping, she tore her lips from his. \u201cCan you feel that?\u201d she whispered, pressing kisses to his jaw and ear. \u201cCan you feel how much I want you? I\u2019ve wanted you for so long.\u201d</p><p>If the evidence weren\u2019t currently sheathing his finger, he could hardly have believed that she wanted him at all. But what did she mean, for so long? He\u2019d barely been back in town a week. Though he\u2019d give her that\u2014it had been a damn long week.</p><p>Releasing his neck, she burrowed one hand in to the space between them, cleaving his waistband from his chilled abdomen. The wet fabric didn\u2019t have much give, but her agile, slender fingers slipped into the gap and worked slowly downward. He froze, one finger still buried inside her. Her breath came hot against his ear. At last, her fingertips grazed the swollen head of his cock.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>She swirled a finger around the tip, and pleasure exploded inside him. He bit her shoulder to hold himself back.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d She licked his cheek. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry ...\u201d The word struck a chord in him. \u201cSay you\u2019ll marry me.\u201d He knew she was reluctant, but he had this one advantage. She wanted him. Against all sense and reason and laws of nature, she wanted him. He\u2019d intended to wait for marriage, but he\u2019d settle for a betrothal. Hell. Right now, he\u2019d settle for just about any syllable out of her mouth that rhymed with \u201cyes.\u201d</p><p>He drew his finger out of her sheath, then plunged it deeper. \u201cSay yes. Say it now.\u201d</p><p>Now. Please let it be now. And then he could take her, right here. Slide straight into that slick, inviting heat. And for once in his life, it might feel right.</p><p>\u201cSay yes.\u201d He added a second finger, pushed deeper still.</p><p>\u201cI ...\u201d Panting, she let her head fall to his collarbone. \u201cI can\u2019t marry anyone. My father. The inn. The village ... They all depend on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them depend on me.\u201d He cinched his free arm about her waist. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of everything. I\u2019ll protect you, and your father, and the village. I\u2019d never allow you to come to harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys ...\u201d</p><p>He nudged back, forcing her to lift her head. The doubt was plain in her eyes. Why couldn\u2019t she believe him? Perhaps it was too much to expect, after only a week\u2014but damn. It still hurt that she didn\u2019t.</p><p>And then, a horrible thought struck. Maybe she didn\u2019t believe him because she knew it was a lie. He had allowed her, and her father, and the entire village to come to harm, long ago. He\u2019d allowed them to suffer for the fourteen years since.</p><p>Could it be she knew something of the truth? He\u2019d never spoken about that night, not to anyone.</p><p>With deep regret, he withdrew his fingers from her body and took her by the waist, setting her back on the boulder. She bit her quivering lip, and he rubbed his hands up and down her arms to warm them. He tried, very hard, to ignore the tight knots of her nipples, thrown into stark relief by her wet gown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMerry ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking!\u201d The voice came from somewhere above.</p><p>Rhys started. \u201cWhat? Who the\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHullo!\u201d the call came once more. \u201cHullo, down there! I\u2019m up here. But don\u2019t you worry, I won\u2019t peek!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Darryl,\u201d she muttered through chattering teeth. \u201cI\u2019d know that voice anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, Rhys looked up to see Darryl Tewkes edging his way along the overhang, both hands pressed to cover his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking!\u201d he repeated. \u201cI know you may very well be indecent, so I\u2019m not looking. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>The youth took a step closer to the edge.</p> <p>\u201cLook!\u201d Meredith and Rhys shouted as one.</p><p>Darryl froze.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Darryl,\u201d she said. \u201cOpen your eyes. We\u2019re clothed, we just had a ...\u201d She gave Rhys a wry smile. \u201cA mishap.\u201d</p><p>That was one way to put it.</p><p>\u201cOh. All right, then.\u201d The youth uncovered his eyes. He glanced down at his feet, mere inches from the edge, and jumped back with a shout.</p><p>Rhys shook his head, chuckling. The fool would be twitching all day now.</p> <p>Grasping a mossy stone for leverage, he hoisted himself out of the pool. Thanks to the cold water, his arousal had flagged rather quickly, all things considering. In fact, he suspected his bollocks might have drawn up into his ribcage.</p><p>He extended a hand to Meredith, and she took it. Pulling her out was no easy task, with the weight of her sodden petticoats and gown complicating matters, but they managed it together, and soon enough she stood dripping on solid ground. The sprigged muslin of her gown was all but translucent, hugging her every bump and curve.</p><p>Confronted with this sight, poor Darryl Tewkes just didn\u2019t know what to do with himself. He raised a hand to his eyes again, then thought better of it and forced the hand back to his side. Eventually he settled for staring up at the sky.</p><p>\u201cMy coat\u2019s up there on the outcropping,\u201d Rhys called. \u201cGive it here, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Certainly.\u201d Darryl did as asked. Except that he nearly tossed the coat straight into the pool. Only a quick, acrobatic snag from Rhys saved it from a watery end.</p><p>He exhaled with limited forbearance. \u201cTewkes, I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re all headed back to the inn. Why don\u2019t you walk around the falls and meet us down here? And bring my boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The youth disappeared once again, and Rhys took the opportunity to drape his coat securely about Meredith\u2019s shoulders.</p> <p>When Darryl emerged through the trees, she asked, \u201cSo what\u2019s this about? Why are you after us?\u201d Her complexion went to ash in an instant. \u201cIt\u2019s not Father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Darryl assured her. \u201cNo. But Lord, I\u2019ve been walking all over this moor, looking for the two of you. There\u2019s a man down at the inn. Quite fancy sort, just come in this morning from London.\u201d A twitching eye turned on Rhys. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for you, Lord Ashworth.\u201d</p><p>When they reached the Three Hounds after another quarter hour of walking, Rhys was fairly certain who they\u2019d meet. So it was no shock to enter the tavern and spy Julian Bellamy occupying the corner table.</p><p>What was a surprise, however, was Bellamy\u2019s companion. He had a girl with him. A very pretty girl, who couldn\u2019t be older than twenty. She had curled yellow hair and an innocent blush that seemed at odds with her lush figure. On closer inspection, that blush looked to be painted on. Strange. Rhys wouldn\u2019t have figured Bellamy to be traveling with a doxy. From all evidence a few weeks ago, the man was in unmitigated, unrequited love with Lady Lily Chatwick, the Stud Club founder\u2019s grieving sister.</p><p>When Bellamy caught sight of Rhys, he rose from the table and met him in the center of the room, directing his friend to remain seated. From the table, the girl gave Rhys an uneasy look.</p><p>He was used to those looks. And with his still-damp breeches, muddied boots, and bits of moss clinging to his coat, Rhys supposed he must look a fright. Even more so than usual.</p><p>\u201cI know I asked you to send my things from London,\u201d he said, greeting Bellamy with a nod. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t expect a personal delivery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrived not a moment too soon, it would seem.\u201d Bellamy cast a disapproving glance at Rhys\u2019s bedraggled attire. As always, the man himself was turned out in stylish, tailored velvet. \u201cGood Lord, what have they done to you out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working. It\u2019s what we simple country folk do. Not all of us can afford to spend our time swanning about London in the latest fashions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the Three Hounds, sir.\u201d Meredith appeared at Rhys\u2019s side, surprising him with her speed. She\u2019d entered by the back way to discreetly change into dry clothing, and she\u2019d certainly done so with haste. She\u2019d woven her damp hair into a single plait hanging down her back, and she wore another of her simple frocks, this one a cinnamon color.</p><p>Beneath that dress, her skin would still be cool to the touch. She would taste of spring water, crisp and sweet. Perhaps she was still wet for him, even now.</p><p>As if she could hear Rhys\u2019s lascivious thoughts, she cleared her throat in rebuke. To Bellamy she said, \u201cCan I bring you and your lady friend some refreshment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandy for me,\u201d Bellamy said. He spoke over his shoulder. \u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d The yellow-haired girl perked, abandoning her examination of her fingernails. \u201cRaspberry shrub would be lovely.\u201d</p><p>Meredith choked on a laugh. \u201cAs a general habit, we don\u2019t do pink and bubbly in this establishment, but I think I\u2019ve a bottle of cordial somewhere. Will that do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Meredith gave Rhys an amused glance as she headed for the bar. \u201cDo have a seat, the three of you.\u201d</p><p>By the time Rhys and Bellamy settled themselves at the table, she was back, bearing a tray with a tumbler of brandy, a skinny glass of cordial, and a pint of ale, which she set before Rhys. He loved that she knew what he\u2019d drink without asking. But he hated that she was serving them, when by all rights she ought to be a lady, with a fleet of servants to wait on her.</p><p>And damn, what kind of gentleman was he, allowing her to serve him this way? Belatedly, he pushed back from the table and stood. It was a meager gesture of respect, but it was something. As she lingered over the task of distributing drinks, Rhys could tell she was curious just what this conference was about. So was he, for that matter.</p><p>\u201cJoin us.\u201d Rhys offered the chair next to his. \u201cMr. Julian Bellamy, this is Mrs. Meredith Maddox. She\u2019s the proprietor of the Three Hounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to speak privately,\u201d Bellamy said. He shot a glance at Meredith. \u201cWith all due respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s also my future wife.\u201d Rhys pulled out the chair. \u201cAnd if this is about Leo Chatwick\u2019s murder, she already knows as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>He chanced a look at Meredith. Her eyes had gone the dark gray of thunderclouds, and they were twice as agitated. He shrugged, well aware that he wasn\u2019t playing fair. Now she had a choice: Accept the label of future wife, or abandon all curiosity about the conversation.</p><p>He stood there, poised with the empty chair, awaiting her decision.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my inn,\u201d she said finally, taking the chair from Rhys\u2019s grasp. \u201cI\u2019ll sit where I please.\u201d</p><p>And sit she did.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cThis is Cora Dunn. She\u2019s the one who found Leo after the attack and brought him to my home.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so this was the prostitute who\u2019d witnessed the murder. And she\u2019d found more than Leo\u2019s senseless form, if Rhys remembered the story right. When they first learned of the murder, it had been assumed Leo was alone when he was attacked. There was no way to confirm it, however, since the whore who recovered his body had disappeared.</p><p>But just two weeks ago, the remaining members of the Stud Club had all been together in Gloucestershire when a stunning revelation was made: Not only had the prostitute been found, but she reported that Leo had been with another man when he was attacked\u2014and his companion\u2019s appearance closely matched that of Julian Bellamy.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Rhys said to the girl. \u201cWho was Leo with that night?\u201d</p><p>She twisted her glass of cordial by the long, slender stem. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, do I? A man who looked a great deal like Mr. Bellamy here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he wasn\u2019t me,\u201d Bellamy interjected.</p><p>\u201cCould have been,\u201d Cora said, sipping her cordial. \u201cI saw him in a darkened alley, you know, and his face was smeared with blood. Don\u2019t know as I\u2019d recognize the gent now, were we sitting face to face.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy swore under his breath. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this. I set the fashion for brainless young bucks of the ton. They ape my hair, my attire, my mannerisms. Lots of young men look like me. This one wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course I don\u2019t believe so.\u201d The girl bit her lip. \u201cBut the two of you do look remarkably like. And his clothes were beautiful.\u201d Propping her chin in her hand, she went on wistfully, \u201cHad a waistcoat of velvet with gold stitching. That stitching glittered, even in the dark. What I wouldn\u2019t give to have embroidery half so fine.\u201d</p><p>A fit of coughing overtook Meredith. She reached for Rhys\u2019s ale and helped herself to a long draught.</p><p>When she attempted to slide it back, he told her, \u201cKeep it.\u201d To Cora, he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you start again. Tell us everything that happened that night, from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was in Covent Garden, in my usual place for the evening. Each lady has her usual place, you know. A hackney stopped right in front of me, and this splendid-looking gent beckoned me inside. Fair hair, light eyes, fine features. I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d she said, directing the comment at Meredith, \u201cit\u2019s not often we get one so handsome as that.\u201d</p><p>Meredith looked completely nonplussed by the \u201cwe\u201d in that sentence, but she merely tilted her head and said, \u201cGo on, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, he complimented my bonnet, which I was quite proud of. I\u2019d just replaced the ribbons a day before. When I said, \u2018I thank you, sir,\u2019 he told me to call him Leo. And then he asked me if I\u2019d like to see a boxing match over in Whitechapel. He\u2019d made plans to attend with a friend, he said, but the friend cried off.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy gave a low groan of culpability. \u201cThat would be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally, I told him, I stay far clear of the East End. That\u2019s for low-class girls, the ones what work the docks. But he was so handsome, and he asked so prettily. And I\u2019d never seen a boxing match, not a real one, so ...\u201d She lifted her eyebrows. \u201cOff we went. On the drive, he was ever so kind to me. Let me drink brandy from his flask. I didn\u2019t even know then that he was a lord, but I could tell he was true Quality. Not from his clothes or his accent, but just his manners.\u201d Cora\u2019s eyes fell, and she traced a groove on the tabletop. \u201cHe treated me like a person, Leo did. Like a sweetheart even, not just a whore. Sometimes I still can\u2019t believe he\u2019s dead. Like to broke my heart, though I\u2019d scarce known him a few hours and we hadn\u2019t even ...\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t finish the thought. No one at the table needed her to.</p><p>Bellamy cleared his throat. \u201cYes, that was Leo. Always considerate of others, regardless of their station. Most fair-minded man I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you went to Whitechapel,\u201d Rhys prompted.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Cora went on. \u201cAnd that boxing match was a sweaty, smelly business. All the men shouting and shoving and carrying on. Didn\u2019t like it at all, but at least it was finished quick. Afterwards, the whole crowd was milling about. Leo was foxed on brandy and giddy from the fight.\u201d She turned to Meredith again and murmured low. \u201cYou know how men are. They get riled up by the violence. Makes \u2019em randy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meredith gave the girl a patient smile. Behind it, he could tell she was chewing a mouthful of unspoken remarks. Rhys wished he could look forward to going to bed with her tonight, just to hear all the thoughts she was so obviously keeping to herself.</p><p>Of course, that wasn\u2019t the only reason he wished they were sharing a bed tonight. Nor even the main reason.</p><p>\u201cLeo took me round the corner. He started talking very sweet to me. What a lovely girl I was, and how lucky a man would be to enjoy my favors.\u201d She laughed a little. \u201cI told him he didn\u2019t need no luck with me, just a shilling or two. He laughed and kissed me on the cheek and promised to give me three. Well, I thought he meant to just duck into a dark corner and lift my skirts, like most of them do\u2014but no. He said he wanted to take me home with him, and would I be lovely to him there? A real bed, he wanted!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFancy that,\u201d Meredith murmured.</p><p>\u201cLeo sent a boy to call the hack. While we were waiting there, a gent called out to him from the shadows. Leo seemed to recognize who it was. He told me to wait right under the streetlamp, and he\u2019d be just a few paces away. The two of them went round the corner to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiscuss what?\u201d Bellamy asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, do I? Couldn\u2019t make out the words. But they were discussing it angrily, I could tell that much. Then it got very quiet, and I started to prickle all over. Thought perhaps they\u2019d forgotten me, and I\u2019d be lost all alone in Whitechapel. All I had to my name was the half-crown sewn into my stays for emergencies.\u201d She drained the rest of her cordial, as if for courage. \u201cSeemed like ages I stood there, not knowing whether to follow after them or not. And then suddenly I heard sounds. Horrid sounds. Punches, blows, cries. Worse than the boxing match.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little shudder. \u201cWere it anyone else, I would have run home that instant. But I\u2019d grown so fond of Leo, and I was ever so scared ... I turned into the alley and let loose with a scream.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone went silent. Rhys supposed, like him, the others were waiting to see if she\u2019d demonstrate.</p><p>Fortunately for Meredith\u2019s cordial glass, the girl didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt took a few moments before I could make out a thing, what with the dark and shadows. But there were two big, coarse-looking men standing there. And at their feet, Leo and his friend were moaning on the ground. I screamed some more. The two men took off running the other direction, disappeared at the end of the alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you recognize them if you saw them again?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, and a blond ringlet bobbed against her cheek. \u201cThey ran away so fast. All I know is that they were big and brutish and fearsome, like ...\u201d Her gaze darted toward Rhys, then quickly away. She cleared her throat. \u201cOh, and one was bald\u2014I remember his head gleaming in the moonlight. And the other ... well, I heard him shout to the first as they ran away. Sounded Scottish. That\u2019s all I know.</p><p>\u201cBesides, all my cares were for Leo. I went to him. He was knocked cold. His friend looked to be in bad shape, too, but he could speak. He told me to go for a hack, and then he gave me an address.\u201d She looked to Bellamy. \u201cYour address.\u201d</p> <p>Rhys and Bellamy exchanged a look.</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cSo I ran back to the street, and as luck would have it, Leo\u2019s boy had just returned with the hack. I made the driver come help me. Told him there were two gents as needed a doctor and quick. But by the time we rushed back to the alley, the dark-haired man had vanished. Only Leo was there.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed again, and a tear streaked down her cheek, trickling through the fine dust of face powder. Bellamy pulled a square of white linen from his pocket, and she accepted it wordlessly.</p><p>\u201cWe brought him to the cab, and I tried to keep him warm. He was shivering and so pale. His breathing was all rattled. \u2018Don\u2019t die,\u2019 I told him, over and over. \u2018Don\u2019t die, Leo, please don\u2019t die just yet.\u2019\u201d She sobbed into the handkerchief. \u201cBut he did. He died right there in my arms. And I kissed him, I couldn\u2019t help it. I tell you, it broke my heart clean in two. Only a few hours, and I was half in love with the man.\u201d</p><p>She cried noisily.</p><p>Rhys averted his eyes. Perhaps it was all the lingering arousal and emotion from their encounter at the pool, but he was strangely moved by Cora\u2019s story. He was glad Leo had some tenderness as he went, even if from a stranger. Charm and fine looks helped him to the end. Most men who died by violence weren\u2019t so fortunate. How many times had his own wounded, broken body been dragged from a tavern floor or battlefield? And never once had he awoken to find a little blond angel hovering over him. Hell, Cora couldn\u2019t even look at Rhys without flinching. The thought of her weeping over his battered form ... it made him laugh.</p><p>The laugh stuck in his throat, and he harrumphed around it.</p><p>He risked a look at Meredith. She caught his gaze, and her knee grazed his beneath the table. Then stayed there, lightly pressing against his leg.</p> <p>It could have been an accident. But he didn\u2019t believe in accidents.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Bellamy said. His suspicious expression was at war with red-rimmed eyes. \u201cYou were so in love with Leo. But you didn\u2019t neglect to strip his pockets, did you?\u201d</p><p>Cora wiped her nose. \u201cWell, I needed coin for the hackney. And he had promised me three shillings, and ...\u201d She shrugged away a great portion of her sentiment. \u201cI\u2019m just a whore, aren\u2019t I? Alive or dead, he could spare a few coins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept,\u201d Rhys said, reaching into his coat\u2019s breast pocket, \u201cone of those coins wasn\u2019t a coin at all.\u201d</p><p>From his pocket he withdrew one of the brass tokens that represented membership in the Stud Club. He laid it on the table, then slid it toward Cora with one fingertip. \u201cYou recognize it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She picked it up, peered at it, laughed at it a little. \u201cQueer little thing, isn\u2019t it? At first, I didn\u2019t know what to make of it. Didn\u2019t figure it was worth anything. I just held on to it in my purse until Jack offered me a guinea for it in trade. I grabbed at the chance, took the next coach home to see my mum in Dover. That\u2019s where your friend found me again.\u201d</p><p>Jack d\u2019Orsay wasn\u2019t precisely a friend, but neither Rhys nor Bellamy argued the point.</p><p>\u201cAfter that night with Leo ...\u201d Her gaze fell to the token, and her voice went soft. \u201cI wanted a change from that world, you know? Working as a Covent Garden girl ... it wasn\u2019t how I planned my life to be.\u201d</p><p>All four of them stared at the table in awkward silence.</p><p>Finally, Rhys said, \u201cThat\u2019s the way of things. Fate laughs in the face of all our plans.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy banged the table with the side of his fist. \u201cWe have to find that man who took Leo into the alleyway. Obviously he was lured into an ambush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. Sounds as though this stranger and your friend were both victims.\u201d This came from Meredith. \u201cThey were both injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was clearly feigning,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cAnd culpable to some degree. Otherwise, why would he have disappeared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Meredith replied, unintimidated. \u201cI agree, you\u2019d best find him and ask. But I doubt you\u2019ll find him here on Dartmoor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it, too. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d He turned to Rhys. \u201cI\u2019m going back to London to see what I can learn. I need a place for Cora to stay. A safe place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean here?\u201d Rhys asked.</p><p>Bellamy nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow wait a minute,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cI run a respectable establishment. The Three Hounds isn\u2019t that kind of inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay all her expenses,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cShe won\u2019t need to ply her trade. She just needs a place to stay. If Leo\u2019s killers knew she was a witness, she could be in danger.\u201d He turned to Rhys. \u201cI thought the inn would be ideal, unless you have someplace else in mind. Have you a personal residence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll stay here.\u201d Meredith rose to her feet, suddenly every inch the welcoming landlady. \u201cCome along then, Cora. You must be fatigued. We\u2019ll find you a room and leave the men to their conversation.\u201d</p><p>Cora rose from the table, and Meredith beckoned her with a motherly hand. \u201cMr. Bellamy, will you be needing accommodations as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, then. The Three Hounds is delighted to welcome you.\u201d The tone in her voice, however, was not a very convincing rendition of delight. \u201cI\u2019ll prepare a room for you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can have mine,\u201d Rhys said. To her confused frown, he added in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019ll be camping out on the moor from now on. To discourage a repeat of this morning\u2019s events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich events?\u201d she whispered. \u201cThe ones at your building site, or the ones ...\u201d Her eyes flashed up toward the bedchambers.</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>Her frown deepened.</p><p>After the ladies left them, Bellamy shot Rhys a strange look. \u201cYou\u2019re marrying? After Leo\u2019s death ... when we discussed Lily\u2019s future, you said you didn\u2019t want to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. Not then.\u201d And he still had no interest in marrying Leo Chatwick\u2019s grieving twin sister. Lily was a refined, elegant lady\u2014in the royal line, if he correctly recalled. Rhys wasn\u2019t the man for her.</p><p>Neither was Julian Bellamy, a fact that explained the man\u2019s persistent ill humor. If ever there was a man who discussed his childhood less willingly than Rhys, it was Bellamy. No one knew where he\u2019d come from, and Rhys himself couldn\u2019t have cared less. But where a lady of Lily Chatwick\u2019s rank was concerned ... even Rhys knew such things mattered. Greatly.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me that in the past week, this widowed landlady has somehow changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy riffled his unkempt shock of hair. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. She\u2019s a comely enough bit of goods, but ... a trifle hard around the edges, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that? Because she challenged you?\u201d Rhys chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s a strong woman.\u201d And sweet, and soft, and secretly vulnerable, and like hot silk between her thighs. But he preferred to keep those sides of Meredith to himself. \u201cShe works hard, and she won\u2019t brook any nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could see that.\u201d</p><p>Rhys flexed his hand until his knuckles cracked. \u201cA man like me has no use for delicate porcelain types.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint acknowledged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Lily?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy sighed roughly. \u201cDelicate. As porcelain. Leo\u2019s heir will arrive from Egypt in a matter of months, and she\u2019ll have to vacate the house. I don\u2019t know what Lily expects to do then, but she refuses to discuss it. Says she\u2019ll deal with it on her own.\u201d He finished off his brandy with an angry draught. \u201cOn her own. What is the world coming to, with these modern women? A man can\u2019t tell them what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it,\u201d Rhys muttered, still thinking of Meredith\u2019s frown. If she was unhappy about his decision to stay on the moor, she could easily change it by marrying him. After that incident in the pool, he knew he\u2019d never make it through another night under the same roof without bedding her.</p><p>\u201cLily\u2019s after me to cease hunting for Leo\u2019s killers. Says it\u2019s useless.\u201d Bellamy shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019ll stop. Not until I find the men responsible and see them hanged. Or worse.\u201d He looked to Rhys. \u201cThat\u2019s where you come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. I\u2019m the \u2018worse.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, these past weeks have been fruitless. I\u2019ve been searching for two nameless, faceless brutes ... not an easy task. Cora\u2019s story has given me new hope. It\u2019s much easier to find a dandy than two common ruffians. There are fewer of them, to start, and gold embroidery does stand out in a crowd. I\u2019ll find him, mark my words. And when I do, I\u2019ll send word to you. We\u2019ll need to get the truth out of him. And you promised to lend muscle, if you recall.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI recall.\u201d He tapped his stiff finger against the tankard. When he\u2019d made that offer, he\u2019d have picked a fight with anything big and angry, just in hopes of losing for a change. \u201cBut things are different now. I have responsibilities here. And I think I\u2019m done with brawling.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy leaned over the table and drilled him with a look. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll come out of retirement for this. You\u2019re a member of the Club, and Leo was our founder. You owe him that much, to avenge his death.\u201d</p><p>Uncertainty quirked the corner of Rhys\u2019s mouth. Just what did he owe Leo Chatwick? This Club of his had done nothing for him. But it was Leo\u2019s murder that had finally convinced Rhys of the futility of chasing after death. If Leo hadn\u2019t been killed, Rhys might not have returned to Buckleigh-in-the-Moor for years. This one chance at redemption might have been a long time coming.</p> <p>Perhaps he did owe Leo a great deal.</p><p>\u201cFind the man first,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>During his brief stay at the Three Hounds, Mr. Julian Bellamy did precisely one thing to endear himself to Meredith. He left before dawn.</p><p>By contrast, she\u2019d expected Cora to sleep until noon\u2014wasn\u2019t that what ladies of the night must do? So the girl\u2019s appearance during morning baking was a true surprise.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, Mrs. Maddox.\u201d</p><p>Meredith lifted a board lined with risen yeast rolls and sneezed at a puff of flour. \u201cMr. Bellamy has already left for London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I gathered as much.\u201d</p><p>Cora was all fresh-faced innocence this morning. No paint or powder to obscure her fair complexion, and her blond hair was styled in a simple knot. Her china-blue muslin day dress was low-cut and in want of a fichu, but otherwise unremarkable in style or quality.</p><p>And despite all this, she was still a very pretty girl. Perhaps prettier than she\u2019d been yesterday. Which made Meredith think the girl would be trouble.</p><p>She didn\u2019t like having Cora in the inn, but she liked the alternatives less. There was no way this harlot was staying in any private residence\u2014be it a London town house or moorland hovel\u2014belonging to Rhys. Meredith might have refused the man\u2019s offer of marriage once or twice, but she wasn\u2019t resigning all interest in him. Not after yesterday at the pool, when she\u2019d been inches away from making years of fantasies come true.</p> <p>She wrenched open the oven door, and a wave of heat swamped her. Sweat beaded instantly on her brow and neck. Her defenses were momentarily stripped. Memories rushed in.</p><p>His strong arms anchoring her in the pool. Their tongues, mating with wild abandon. The hot, swollen tip of his arousal gliding under her touch, silky as twice-milled flour.</p><p>His fingers, so thick inside her ...</p><p>She thrust the bread into the oven and banged the door shut. Focus, Meredith. Her torrid daydreams had already scorched the first batch of rolls.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast is over,\u201d she told Cora, wiping her hands on her apron. \u201cAnd the noon meal will be awhile yet. But there will be fresh bread in a few minutes. Do you take coffee or tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s chocolate?\u201d</p><p>A pretty face and a taste for sweets? Trouble. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tea, please.\u201d</p> <p>When Meredith moved to put the kettle on, the girl intervened. \u201cOh, let me do it, ma\u2019am. When I lived in London, I always made tea for the girls in the house. I\u2019ve a knack for it.\u201d</p><p>Meredith surrendered the kettle. As she watched the girl fill it with water and place it on the hob, she cleared her throat and brought out her sternest voice. \u201cListen, Cora. We both know this discussion is coming, so we may as well have it over with now.\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s eyebrows arched in surprise, as if she\u2019d no idea what Meredith was going to say. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my inn, and it\u2019s a respectable establishment. The local men who come in here of an evening\u2014they\u2019re going to take quite an interest in you. But even if you are a friend of Lord Ashworth\u2019s, I warn you now, I won\u2019t abide any mischief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m not wanting any mischief. I know Mr. Bellamy said he\u2019d pay my account, but I\u2019d rather work for my keep.\u201d</p><p>Meredith narrowed her eyes. \u201cI thought I just told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not that kind of work.\u201d The kettle rumbled. Cora plucked a towel from the table and wrapped it about her hand before removing the kettle from the hob. \u201cThat life was never what I wanted. I hardly know how it happened. I was living in Dover\u2014that\u2019s where I was raised. My mother worked as a seamstress there, and one day she sent me to the market. I was dallying with friends on my way home, and a fancy gent drove by in a splendid coach. Handsome as anything, he was. He opened the door and called me a pretty little thing and asked, would I like to ride with him to London? Why certainly I would. Always wanted to see London, what girl didn\u2019t?\u201d She frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s the tea?\u201d</p><p>Meredith motioned toward the tea caddy.</p><p>Biting her lip, Cora measured tea leaves into the pot with childlike concentration. She was such a strange mix of girl and woman. Meredith couldn\u2019t decide which she was feigning: the innocence, or the worldliness.</p><p>\u201cSo you went with him to London ...\u201d she prompted, vaguely wondering why she was even taking an interest.</p><p>\u201cI went with him to London. And when I arrived there, I was a whore. The handsome gent shoved me out in Covent Garden and tossed me a shilling.\u201d She gave a matter-of-fact shrug as she covered the tea leaves with steaming water and set them to steep.</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirteen.\u201d</p><p>Meredith gasped. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Thirteen and alone in the world, with no other way of earning bread, no coin to go home ... I didn\u2019t think my mother would even want me back.\u201d A little smile curved her lips as she stared down at the tea. \u201cBut she did. When I went to see her just last month, she told me she\u2019d prayed for me every single day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she had.\u201d Meredith poked at the fire. Smoke stung her eyes, giving her a convenient excuse to blink away a tear. The girl\u2019s story was undeniably moving. Stirring enough to blow years of accumulated dust off her maternal instincts. She might be barren, but the Three Hounds worked like a magnet for unwanted adolescents in need of a friend. First Gideon, then Darryl. Now this girl, too.</p><p>She took the towel from Cora\u2019s hand and prepared to remove the rolls from the oven. \u201cAnd how old are you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen, ma\u2019am. And I don\u2019t want to go back to that life, I don\u2019t. Please let me work for you, Mrs. Maddox. By the time I leave here, mayhap I\u2019ll have prospects for better employment. Perhaps Mr. Bellamy or Lord Ashworth would see fit to furnish me with a character reference, and I could find a post in service. Could send my mother some money from time to time, and she wouldn\u2019t have to worry where it come from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can see you\u2019ve thought it all through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLay awake half the night, ma\u2019am. I suppose that\u2019s why I overslept.\u201d</p><p>Meredith offered her a fresh roll, and Cora accepted it eagerly, crying out in alarm when it singed her fingertips. Meredith smiled at the ensuing juggling act, and at Cora\u2019s bubbly, girlish laugh.</p><p>\u201cIs there jam?\u201d she asked hopefully, her cheeks flushing pink.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, there is. And honey too.\u201d And the next time she saw Gideon, Meredith would ask him to bring round some chocolate.</p><p>As she retrieved the pots of sticky sweetness, Meredith thought of herself at Cora\u2019s age. She\u2019d already been caretaker to her invalid father and the family\u2019s only potential wage-earner. All that, plus desperate and hungry. Fortunately, thanks to her father and dear late mother, she\u2019d had some skills and education. Sometimes she\u2019d suspected Maddox of marrying her out of pity. Or perhaps simply because she knew how to read and write and do sums better than most anyone in the village. Certainly better than Maddox himself.</p><p>She\u2019d been lucky. By contrast, Cora had found herself friendless, penniless, uneducated, and transplanted to an unfamiliar city at the age of thirteen ... after being crudely indoctrinated into womanhood by some passing \u201cgentleman\u201d with a high-sprung carriage. It was remarkable that she\u2019d survived at all, and her tale certainly explained why she acted like a girl who was thirteen-nearing-thirty.</p><p>It made a tragic sort of sense that a child stripped of innocence might cultivate another, more willful na\u00efvet\u00e9 to replace it. She thought of Rhys, and his stubborn belief in fate. What lies would an abused boy tell himself, rather than believe he\u2019d somehow earned such vile treatment?</p><p>Cora poured two cups of tea, and Meredith took a cautious sip. \u201cNot bad at all,\u201d she said, savoring the rich warmth spreading down her throat. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you coffee next. There\u2019s an apron hanging on a nail, just the other side of the onion bin.\u201d</p><p>The girl clapped her hands together. \u201cYou\u2019ll allow me to work for you?\u201d</p><p>Meredith nodded as she took another sip of tea. She wanted to give the girl a chance, and there was no doubt she could use the extra help. Once the new construction started, she\u2019d have a crew of hungry men to feed. And those hungry men would be earning wages, a portion of which they\u2019d slide right back across the bar at the end of the day.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be my new serving girl,\u201d she said. \u201cYour day starts at breakfast, and then you\u2019ll help Mrs. Ware with the cooking until the noon meal. Your afternoons will be your own from two to five, and then it\u2019s back to tend the bar until close. How does that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it sounds lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely?\u201d Meredith chuckled. \u201cWe\u2019ll consider this first week a trial. Innkeeping is difficult labor. You may not take to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I will.\u201d Cora\u2019s cheeks dimpled with a grin as she looped the apron over her arms. \u201cI\u2019m stronger than I look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt it. We women usually are.\u201d She slid a bowl of risen dough in the girl\u2019s direction and demonstrated the way to form rolls. \u201cBut mind you, this isn\u2019t London. Some of the men hereabouts are of a rough sort. If they give you any trouble, you\u2019re to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t go wandering the countryside on your own. The moor can be dangerous if you don\u2019t know your way. If there\u2019s anywhere you need to go, the stable hand will take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment, he won\u2019t.\u201d A deep voice interrupted them. \u201cDarryl\u2019s occupied putting up my mare.\u201d</p><p>Meredith turned to spy Gideon standing in the doorway between kitchen and tavern. Leaving the rolls to Cora, she hurried to meet him. God, she hoped he hadn\u2019t ...</p><p>\u201cNo. No wagon today,\u201d he said, answering her unspoken question. \u201cI\u2019ve come on horseback, just to suss matters out. Brought your newspapers, though.\u201d He held them aloft. \u201cThere\u2019s a fine bottle of port in my saddlebag, and ...\u201d His gaze drifted over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAnd bloody hell, who is that?\u201d</p><p>She looked over her shoulder at Cora. The girl was covered in flour to her wrists, industriously pulling the yeasty dough and shaping it into knots. The lumps of risen dough bore a marked resemblance to her pale breasts, overflowing her bodice in two healthy scoops as she leaned over the table.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Cora,\u201d she said, turning back to Gideon.</p><p>His unshaven throat worked. \u201cShe looks like a harlot.\u201d</p><p>Meredith pulled him through the doorway, out from the girl\u2019s hearing. \u201cWell, she was. Until recently. Now she\u2019s my new barmaid.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cYou\u2019re taking in whores? I thought this wasn\u2019t that kind of inn. You\u2019re always talking about making the Three Hounds a respectable establishment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt is respectable. As I said, she\u2019s not working that trade anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. So this is your new charity project, rehabilitating fallen women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s a friend of Lord Ashworth\u2019s, and she needs a place to stay.\u201d</p> <p>His jaw clenched. \u201cAshworth\u2019s still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere in the inn? No. Here in the neighborhood? Yes.\u201d</p><p>Gideon swore. \u201cSo he\u2019s moving his personal whore into the inn. And what\u2019s next? Don\u2019t let him get cozy here, Meredith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not his whore.\u201d She sighed. This wasn\u2019t how she\u2019d hoped to break the news of the construction partnership. \u201cSit at the bar,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you something to eat, and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Back in the kitchen, she praised Cora\u2019s progress as she poured a mug of tea and heaped a plate high with hot rolls and a cold leg of chicken from the night before. She set both mug and plate before Gideon on the bar. As was the case with most men, his mood usually improved after a meal.</p> <p>\u201cNow listen,\u201d she said as he fell on the food, \u201cI won\u2019t hear anyone speaking that way of Cora. She had a bad lot of luck when she was younger, and circumstances forced her into a less-than-honorable occupation. Which makes her not so different from some smugglers I know. Anyhow, she won\u2019t be taking any customers here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d He washed down his third roll with a gulp of tea. Craning his neck, he curved his gaze around Meredith to gawk through the kitchen doorway. \u201cOld habits and all that. With looks like hers, she won\u2019t lack for offers. What if she just gets bored? What if she takes a fancy to some traveler who pays her a few compliments, and takes him to her bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she wouldn\u2019t be much different from me, now would she?\u201d Side-stepping to block his view, she said icily, \u201cFor a man with no aspirations to the clergy, you\u2019re frightfully judgmental today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t like it. She\u2019s trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of my favorite people are.\u201d</p><p>When he failed to respond, she studied him close. He\u2019d downed four rolls and the chicken now, and he still had that gleam of hunger in his eye. So here was the explanation for his ill humor. He wanted Cora. He desired the girl, and he was annoyed with himself for it.</p> <p>To be truthful, Meredith was a mite annoyed with him, too. She was used to Gideon making eyes at her over his mug of tea. But Cora was younger, prettier, and decidedly more buxom. She supposed a man couldn\u2019t look at her without his mouth watering, any more than he could stand dry-mouthed before a juicy, well-seasoned roast of beef.</p><p>Still, it hurt her pride a bit.</p><p>\u201cThe men will be brawling over her every night,\u201d he said, a mulish set to his jaw. \u201cIf both Symmonds boys survive the week, I\u2019ll be shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be too worn out to brawl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be working.\u201d</p><p>He made a dismissive snort. \u201cNot likely. While Ashworth\u2019s still in the area, I can\u2019t resume with the wagons. The men are on furlough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be working for me. And for Lord Ashworth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMeredith,\u201d he growled. \u201cTell me you\u2019re joking. And do it fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d She told him of the building scheme, all the while enduring his cool glare\u2014one that only grew colder by successive degrees, the more she explained the plan. By the time she finished, she would have sworn frost had crystallized on his eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cYou must understand,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cI\u2019ve been saving money for years now, both thick and thin, and it would have taken me another decade to raise the funds Lord Ashworth can pull from his coat lining. I have to take this chance, can\u2019t you see? This is my one opportunity to improve the inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s rebuilding Nethermoor Hall, for Christ\u2019s sake. What\u2019ll become of my goods up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not rebuilding the Hall. He\u2019s building a cottage nearby. During construction, we\u2019ll be able to give you honest work, hauling legitimate supplies. As for the other ... well, the man can only be in one place at a time. When they\u2019re busy putting a rise on the inn, you\u2019ll be able to come and go from the moors as you please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith whom? You\u2019ve stolen my workforce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it will take some doing, but you\u2019ll make it work. Gideon, you don\u2019t have a choice. Lord Ashworth\u2019s not going to leave easily. He\u2019s determined to see that cottage built.\u201d She twisted an apron string about her finger. \u201cHe\u2019s building it for Father. I can\u2019t say no.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t tell him Rhys was also ostensibly building the cottage for her, as his bride. No point in mentioning it. To that much, she\u2019d already said no.</p><p>\u201cAnd once these little construction projects are finished? What then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll leave.\u201d The truth of it sank in her gut and weighed heavily there. \u201cI\u2019m certain of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because it\u2019s a certainty. The man\u2019s been absent fourteen years. A whim brought him back, and the next fickle breeze will chase him off again. I just hope your building\u2019s raised before it happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be,\u201d she said, shifting defensively. \u201cWith the amount of money he\u2019s spending, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d call it a whim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an aristocrat. Their whims may be expensive, but they\u2019re whims just the same.\u201d</p><p>Sniffing, she reached for his plate, stacking the silver and mug atop it. He wasn\u2019t saying anything she hadn\u2019t been telling herself since the night Rhys walked into this bar. But he said it very convincingly, and it was only just now she\u2019d let herself realize how very much she wished they were both wrong.</p><p>Gideon leaned on the bar. He spoke with quiet intensity. \u201cThere are two kinds of people, Meredith. Ones who are made to stay in one place, and ones who aren\u2019t. We\u2019re the first kind, you and me. God knows, we could have left this village in our dust and gone on to bigger things, better things. But we didn\u2019t, either one of us. Because we care about this godforsaken place, even if it never gave a damn for us. We\u2019ll cling to the breast that weaned us, trying to wring milk from a granite teat, and don\u2019t try to tell us it\u2019s futile, because we already know. But we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cAs for Ashworth ...\u201d He made a gruff sound in his throat. \u201cHe\u2019s the other kind, Merry. The leaving kind. You\u2019d do well to remember it.\u201d He looked over his shoulder at the tavern, glancing from roofbeams to hearth. \u201cYou\u2019ve poured years into this place. Work, sweat, blood, tears. What would you do to protect it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d She didn\u2019t even think the word, just spoke it. \u201cAnything in my power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said ominously, \u201cI know you would. And you know I feel the same about my trade. To protect my livelihood, I\u2019d do anything in my power. The only difference between us is, I travel armed.\u201d</p><p>The door creaked open.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t the famous Gideon Myles. And his much-touted pistol.\u201d</p><p>Rhys stood in the tavern entrance. He took up so much of the doorway that only a few meager scraps of sunlight framed his imposing silhouette. Slow, heavy strides carried him into the room, and Meredith\u2019s heart bounced with each one.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Myles,\u201d he said, propping one elbow on the bar, \u201cit\u2019s my experience that men who are always bragging about the size of their firearms are compensating for other\u201d\u2014he raked Gideon with a derisive glance\u2014\u201cdeficiencies.\u201d He turned to Meredith. \u201cGood morning, Mrs. Maddox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied stupidly.</p><p>Yes. It was a very good morning, now.</p><p>Rhys looked magnificent. Fresh-scrubbed, clean-shaven, and turned out like a gentleman from head to toe\u2014topcoat, cravat, waistcoat, trousers, boots. How had he managed it, camping out on the moor? She had visions\u2014delicious visions\u2014of him bathing in the stream, shaving in the glassy reflection of the pool. But why? For what earthly purpose?</p><p>Though her brain puzzled over the mystery, the rest of her had no question. She knew in her blood he\u2019d made the effort for her. And that made him the most powerfully arousing sight she\u2019d ever beheld. He smelled of soap and wild sage and clean male skin. She stared hard at the snow-white tangle of linen at his throat. Her fingers itched to get at that knot, wrest it open, wend inside his shirt, and lay claim to all within. He was like one big elaborately wrapped gift that she longed to tear open.</p><p>She laughed silently at the irony. All that care he\u2019d put into his dress, with the ultimate result that she wanted him immediately, completely naked.</p><p>His fingers, so thick inside her ...</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for church?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The word jarred her. \u201cCh-church? Did you say church?\u201d And no. She was absolutely ready for something, but church wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>\u201cIt is the first Sunday of the month, is it not?\u201d</p><p>She nodded in disbelief. This was the reason he was all dandied up? For church?</p><p>As if in confirmation, the church bell began to toll.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re ready,\u201d he said, \u201cI thought you might walk over with me.\u201d</p><p>Meredith drew in her breath with an audible hiss.</p><p>A lazy, lopsided smirk eased its way across Rhys\u2019s face.</p><p>Oh, he was a sly devil. Dressing to seduce, and then tempting her with the one chaste activity that would make them an official pair in the eyes of the village. Walking to and from church together was something courting couples did. Hereabouts, it was tantamount to announcing an engagement.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need me to walk with you,\u201d she protested. \u201cYou can see the church from the front door. It\u2019s paces away, just across the road. You can\u2019t get lost.\u201d</p><p>Gideon spoke up. \u201cYou heard the lady. She\u2019s not walking anywhere with you. Why don\u2019t you walk straight out of town?\u201d</p><p>Perfect. Just what she needed, a contest between Rhys and Gideon to see who could piss the farthest. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll go this morning. I ...\u201d She put a hand to her temple. \u201cI have a touch of headache.\u201d</p><p>Rhys didn\u2019t answer, just slowly circled the counter to her side of the bar. Meredith braced her hands on the polished wood as he came to stand behind her, a little closer than was friendly. A long, silent moment passed, and the tempo of her pulse doubled. What did he mean to do?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t even certain she\u2019d felt it, at first. The sensation was more quiet than a whisper, more subtle than insinuation. Just the ghost of a caress tracing her lowermost left rib. The feeling intensified as it scraped over the vulnerable notch between waist and hip. Then snaked over the small of her back, insidious and tantalizing.</p><p>With sudden clarity, she realized what was happening. This storm of wicked sensation was all the result of one simple, deceptively innocent act. Rhys had her apron string between his fingers, and he was giving it a tug.</p><p>Slowly, surely ... with an unwavering purpose she felt from the arches of her feet to the tingling roots of her hair ... he was pulling the string loose.</p><p>There was a moment of tension. The length of rolled muslin drew taut. Quivered, resisted. At last, the knot surrendered.</p><p>And she was completely undone.</p><p>Confident hands rose to her shoulders. Hooking a finger under each strap, he drew the untied apron down her arms. She began to tremble by the time he reached her elbows. To disguise it, she took the task from him, shrugging the apron over her wrists.</p><p>Her tongue was thick as she swallowed around it. Awareness prickled over every inch of her flesh.</p><p>\u201cMeredith.\u201d His deep, insistent voice fell on her nape. \u201cWalk with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Maddox?\u201d From the kitchen, Cora\u2019s bright voice clashed through her desire. \u201cWas that the church bell?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meredith clutched the discarded apron to her chest, as if she needed to cover herself for modesty\u2019s sake. He\u2019d removed nothing but this scrap of flour-crusted muslin, yet she felt bared to the skin.</p><p>Cora walked out from the kitchen, and drew up short when she came face-to-face with Rhys. The girl swallowed hard. \u201cGood morning, my lord,\u201d she told her slippers, apparently unable to look him in the face. \u201cI ... I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>Bless him, Rhys tried not to look offended. But Meredith\u2014who had no problem looking him in the face for hours on end\u2014thought she caught a fleeting wince.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, Miss Dunn,\u201d he said gently. \u201cThat was indeed the church bell. I was just preparing to walk over. If Mrs. Maddox will join me.\u201d</p><p>Meredith twisted the apron in her hands. \u201cBut the baking ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs all finished, ma\u2019am.\u201d Cora smiled.</p><p>\u201cIs it now? That\u2019s convenient.\u201d Rhys cocked an eyebrow. \u201cThe resourceful Miss Dunn has finished the baking. You\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>He offered Meredith his arm.</p> <p>She stared at it.</p><p>A tense silence filled the room, expanding like a bubble until it encompassed them all\u2014Meredith, Rhys, Gideon, Cora. No one seemed willing to prick it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m new to the village,\u201d Cora finally put in, even as her voice faltered. \u201cI\u2019d be obliged if you\u2019d show me the way to the church, my lord. That is ... if you reckon they\u2019d allow a girl like me inside.\u201d</p><p>Meredith wanted to bury her face for shame. A whore-turned-serving girl was correcting her manners.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Rhys said, clearing his throat. He offered Cora the same arm Meredith had declined. \u201cWe\u2019ll do this, Miss Dunn. I\u2019ll step over the threshold first. If the ground doesn\u2019t open up and suck me down to hell straightaway, it ought to be safe for you.\u201d</p><p>With a brave smile, Cora cautiously linked her arm with his. \u201cThank you, my lord. That\u2019s very good of you, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p> <p>The two of them started for the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all walk together,\u201d Meredith blurted out. Hurrying round the bar, she nudged Gideon from his stool and jammed her arm through his. \u201cAll four of us.\u201d</p><p>When he tried to withdraw his arm, she dug her fingernails into his sleeve. She knew he hadn\u2019t darkened the church door since the old vicar left, but he would fall to his knees in prayer today. Even if she had to knock his legs out from under him.</p><p>Tugging Gideon forward, Meredith shut up the tavern, then hurried to keep step with Rhys and Cora as they entered the courtyard. What a party they made: a lord, a whore, a smuggler, and a widow, all walking to the church. It was like the prelude to some bizarre, blasphemous joke that would only sound more humorous with successive pints of cider.</p><p>As it was, Meredith had a hard time not releasing a drunken giggle as they stepped through the entrance. Surprisingly enough, the earth did not open to swallow them all in one efficient gulp. As had been the custom in Buckleigh-in-the-Moor since long before Meredith\u2019s time, the men occupied one side of the church, and the ladies sat opposite. She took it upon herself to separate Cora from Rhys\u2019s arm and herded her down a narrow wooden pew. Across the aisle, her father and Darryl sat in one of the first rows. Father caught her eye and gave her an approving nod.</p><p>When Rhys took his seat at the end of the same pew, Meredith worried for a moment that his colossal bulk would act as the trigger for a catapult, launching Father and Darryl into the air.</p><p>It didn\u2019t, but there was a creaking moment of concern.</p><p>Gideon didn\u2019t join their group. He eased into the row behind, crossing his arms over his chest. His surly expression matched his posture of disrespect.</p> <p>It did something strange to her insides, just gazing at them all, seated so close together. Despite their differences and their ambivalence toward one another, she cared for all four men, in different ways. She liked having them all in her sights at one time.</p><p>Darryl drew her attention with a frantic wave. His eyes shilling-wide, he pointed at Cora. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d he mouthed.</p><p>\u201cCora,\u201d she said back. \u201cNew barmaid.\u201d</p><p>The youth stared, his jaw gone slack with sentiments that had no place in a house of God.</p><p>Darryl\u2019s weren\u2019t the only eyes fixed on Cora, either. Throughout the sanctuary, every man\u2019s eyes held a look of fascinated rapture. Every woman\u2019s gaze burned with envy. Church and tavern attendance were likely to go up during Cora\u2019s stay, she\u2019d wager.</p><p>When the curate took the pulpit, she noticed that he and Rhys exchanged little nods of greeting, as though they\u2019d been already introduced. Perhaps Rhys had taken it upon himself to greet the clergyman earlier\u2014it would make sense that he had, if he were determined to start fulfilling the role of local lord.</p><p>Perhaps he truly did mean to stay.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s words echoed in her ear. He\u2019s the other kind, Merry. The leaving kind.</p><p>Despite all the excitement and confusion of the morning, as the service began, she remembered why she so rarely attended anymore\u2014for the same reason she read her newspapers standing up. As hard as she labored day in and day out, if she sat still for more than three minutes at a stretch, her body interpreted it as an invitation to doze. During the first reading, somewhere between \u201cbegat\u201d and \u201cspake,\u201d it was as though her chin grew a thick coating of lead. Her neck muscles simply refused to hold it up.</p><p>\u201cMeredith Maddox.\u201d</p><p>She jolted awake. Was that her name she\u2019d just heard? Surely this curate hadn\u2019t developed the habit of chastising sleepy congregants from the pulpit.</p><p>\u201cAnd Rhys St. Maur,\u201d the curate went on, \u201cboth of Buckleigh-in-the-Moor. If any of you know of any cause or just impediment why these two persons should not be joined together in holy matrimony, ye are to declare it. This is the first time of asking.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>The entire assembly went dead silent. No one was sleeping now. And Meredith had never been more awake. Banns. He\u2019d told the curate to read the banns, announcing their intent to marry in front of the entire village. In front of her father. In front of Gideon Myles. Of all the presumptuous ...</p><p>With a loud harrumph, the curate turned the page of his liturgy and began to intone the psalm in a low, sonorous voice. No one stood. No one sang. When the curate paused, no one joined the response.</p><p>And since they were all so clearly waiting for her to make a scene, Meredith decided to oblige them. She rose in her pew and confronted Rhys across the aisle. \u201cYou had him read the banns? What on earth would possess you to do that?\u201d</p><p>Did he mean to simply circumvent her? Persistence in a suitor was one thing. Complete disregard for a lady\u2019s willing acceptance was another.</p><p>\u201cThey have to be read three times,\u201d Rhys said, as if it should be obvious. \u201cHe only comes here once a month. If we\u2019re to be married with any sort of reasonable speed, I thought ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you on about? We aren\u2019t engaged!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cBut we will be married. Call it faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ...\u201d Her hands balled into fists at her sides. \u201cYou are impossible.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to his prayer book and read with beatific calm, \u201c\u2018With God, nothing shall be impossible.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Meredith turned into the aisle. She couldn\u2019t remain there a moment longer without profaning the place.</p><p>She stormed straight out of the chapel, and the entire congregation followed in a thunder of footsteps. Not surprising. Church service happened once a month, but melodramas like these were the stuff of the annual fair.</p><p>\u201cMeredith!\u201d Rhys called to her as she hurried down the church steps and turned into the road. Unfortunately, his strides were worth three of hers. He caught her arm and wheeled her to face him. \u201cYou can\u2019t run away from this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he talking about?\u201d Gideon appeared at her side, breathless. \u201cHave you agreed to marry this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted, snatching her hand from Rhys\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to kill him for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Once she\u2019d mastered her voice, she repeated. \u201cNo, there is no violence necessary. And no, I have not agreed to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but she will,\u201d Rhys said with a saintly expression. \u201cSo it has been written.\u201d He looked down at the open prayer book he still carried in his hand and flipped a page.</p><p>\u201cQuote to me one more time from that book,\u201d Meredith said, leveling a finger at him, \u201cand you invite its desecration.\u201d</p><p>His mouth snapped shut. So did the book.</p><p>By now the entire village\u2014churchgoers and the rest\u2014had assembled in the road to watch the commotion.</p><p>\u201cLa!\u201d exclaimed Cora, watching from a few paces away. \u201cThis is so romantic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is nothing,\u201d Darryl whispered to her. \u201cJust wait until I take you on a tour of the moors. We\u2019ve ancient burial cairns and haunted ruins ... It\u2019s a mystical journey through time.\u201d</p><p>The girl cooed softly. \u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing about this is romantic!\u201d Meredith cried, running a hand through her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s oafish, and ... and overbearing. Not to mention, insulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsulting?\u201d Rhys echoed. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be proposed marriage as some sort of eventuality of fate, regardless of how I might feel about the idea? Simply because the man in question has nothing better to do with his time?\u201d She turned to Cora. \u201cPerhaps that meets your definition of romance, but it doesn\u2019t square with mine.\u201d</p><p>Rhys cocked his head. \u201cSo that\u2019s the problem,\u201d he said wonderingly. \u201cYou\u2019re holding out for romance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you meant. You want romance. You want to be wooed.\u201d He looked to the horizon, whistled softly, and muttered an oath that surely wouldn\u2019t be found in the pages of his prayer book. \u201cI\u2019m no good at that.\u201d</p><p>Gideon arched a brow. \u201cToo bad for you.\u201d</p><p>Thoroughly exasperated, she looked from one man to the other. \u201cListen, the both of you. I don\u2019t intend to marry anyone. That inn across the road is the heart of this village. And my heart is in that inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve pledged to fund improvements to the Three Hounds. A new wing of guest rooms, no less. And in time, a stable of posting horses.\u201d</p><p>A murmur of interest swept the crowd.</p><p>Rhys continued in a voice for all to hear, \u201cThere\u2019ll be work to be done, wages to be earned. With Mrs. Maddox\u2019s help, I plan to ensure the well-being of the inn, and of the village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d Gideon seethed, \u201cbut I\u2019ve been doing both those things for some time now. Looking after the inn and the village. With Mrs. Maddox\u2019s help.\u201d He puffed his chest. \u201cNo one wants you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may not want me, but they\u2019ve got me. Which means this town has no more need of you.\u201d</p><p>The crowd hushed.</p><p>Red surged up Gideon\u2019s throat, spreading up his face, all the way to his hairline. \u201cDon\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rhys said, \u201cYou can go, Mr. Myles.\u201d</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t, Meredith wanted to protest. It didn\u2019t matter whether or not the place needed him; Gideon needed this place. The smuggling trade wasn\u2019t the half of it. Even though he\u2019d grown to a man, that abandoned boy still lived inside him, craving family, friendship, acceptance. He didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d find them anywhere else. If Rhys backed him into a corner ... there was no telling what he\u2019d do.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s hand went to cover the pistol jammed in the waistband of his trousers. His index finger tapped in an ominous rhythm.</p><p>\u201cGideon, no. You\u2019re better than that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAm I?\u201d He flicked Meredith a glance. \u201cLet\u2019s have her decide, shall we? She knows best what\u2014or whom\u2014this village needs. Who will it be, Meredith? Lord Ashworth? Or me? Seems this place isn\u2019t big enough for the two of us.\u201d</p><p>Wonderful. How could he put her in such a position? The eyes of the village were on her now. This wasn\u2019t the time to appear hesitant or unsure. Meredith drew a shaky breath and clasped her hands together to keep them from trembling.</p><p>\u201cThis village needs an inn,\u201d she said, speaking to the crowd. \u201cA respectable establishment, fit for quality guests. Men may come and go. But this road we\u2019re standing on will always be here. It\u2019s our one resource, and it will bring us a steady stream of travelers with coin to spend. We just need to be ready to serve them.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the assembled villagers began to nod.</p><p>She tilted her head toward Rhys. \u201cWe need Lord Ashworth to fund the improvements.\u201d She gestured at Gideon. \u201cWe need Mr. Myles to haul the supplies and stores. And we need every willing, able-bodied man to join in the labor.\u201d</p><p>Lowering her voice, she turned to Rhys and Gideon. \u201cGentlemen, if this village isn\u2019t big enough for the two of you ... I suggest you begin the work of enlarging it.\u201d</p><p>She turned and walked briskly toward the inn.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Gideon caught up and grabbed her by the elbow. \u201cHow long will it take, this building scheme?\u201d</p> <p>She looked skyward for the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t know ... two months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive or take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, then,\u201d he said through his teeth. \u201cBecause I know this is important to you, I\u2019ll give you two months. See that Ashworth is gone at the end of them. Or it\u2019s God\u2019s truth, Meredith ...\u201d His eyes went gunmetal gray. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>He turned on his heel and stalked off to the stables, leaving her with nothing but a cold certainty that he meant that threat. At the horse barn door, he stopped for a moment before disappearing inside. \u201cTwo months.\u201d</p><p>Rhys came to stand beside her, laying a hand to the small of her back. \u201cWell, glad to know that\u2019s all settled. Good. He\u2019ll be here for the wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Meredith was seriously beginning to wonder if he hadn\u2019t taken a grenade to the head during his time on the Peninsula.</p><p>\u201cTwo months. That\u2019s what Myles said, wasn\u2019t it? We\u2019ll be married in two months. Next month will be the second reading of the banns, and then a month after that, the third. We can be married that very Sunday.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him. \u201cFor the tenth time, I haven\u2019t agreed to marry you. And didn\u2019t you hear Gideon just now? He will kill you.\u201d</p><p>He made a derisive sound. \u201cHe might try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ... and infuriating!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget indestructible. And here\u2019s something else. I\u2019m your future husband.\u201d He cast a glance around the crowded courtyard. \u201cAll of Buckleigh-in-the-Moor knows it now, so you might as well get used to the idea. In the meantime, I\u2019ll do my best with the romance.\u201d</p> <p>He lifted her hand and brought it to his lips, pressing a warm kiss to her knuckles. And despite all her attempts to keep a disapproving expression on her face, below the neck she melted to mist.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be wooed,\u201d she said feebly. And completely unconvincingly, even to her own hearing. \u201cGo away, damn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll go.\u201d He backed away, grinning ear to ear. \u201cI\u2019ll go. But I\u2019ll be back. With flowers.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>After three weeks of camping on the moor, Rhys had learned to enjoy the solitude at night. In the army, there had always been men about. Even though officers slept in tents, he could always feel the bodies crushed around it, hear the noises of men snoring, coughing, frigging themselves to sleep. Truthfully, it hadn\u2019t bothered him. The alternative was to be left alone with his memories, and those were far less pleasant than any rude sounds created by men or war.</p><p>But now he kept vigil with something other than memories of the past: plans for the future. And as such, Rhys didn\u2019t mind being left alone at all.</p><p>There were still sounds enough to fill the night. The soft howl of the wind, the screeches of ravens and owls, the strangled hiss of the peat fire. Once asleep, he probably added his own nightmare-induced cries to the chorus, but here was another benefit of isolation: There was no one around to hear.</p><p>He and the men had completed two rises on the cottage now. The walls stood two feet thick and five feet high, so far. They formed a solid box with no entrance or window. The holes for doors and window glass would be sawed once the house was complete. After they laid the next rise, Rhys wouldn\u2019t be able to vault in and out of the structure any longer. He\u2019d have to get a ladder, he supposed, or make his bed on the ground nearby.</p><p>But for now, he slept inside his house. Tonight he lay face-up on his pallet of blankets, staring at the four earthen walls rising up around him and the empty gray sky overhead. It was one of those strange, misty nights where a thin fog trapped the moonlight close to the earth, but no stars shone through.</p><p>To others, he supposed the unfinished cottage might resemble some sort of mausoleum, but Rhys had never felt more alive. He could scarcely sleep at night for the plans tumbling through his mind. Plans for cottage furnishings and plans for the new stables, and some disconnected wonderings about whether the Duke of Morland would sell him a mare suitable for breeding with Osiris. And all sorts of plans for Meredith.</p><p>Which parts of her body he\u2019d like to stroke, and which to kiss. Which parts might respond more favorably to a lick ...</p><p>Just as that pleasant image was carrying him off to sleep, Rhys was startled awake by a loud sound. A new sound.</p><p>There it was again. A noise like rocks clacking together, or the scraping of chain. Too clumsy to be the work of any nocturnal creature.</p><p>He rose from his pallet and strode over to the corner where he\u2019d left an old crate. Planting one boot on the crate, he grasped the top of the wall with his hands and vaulted up to sit on the packed-earth wall. He scanned the darkness. Nothing caught his eye, but the sound reached his ears again. This time, more like a distant bang. And was that an inhuman howl, or a trick of the wind?</p><p>Finally, he turned toward the hillside and looked up to the rise where the ruins of Nethermoor Hall could still be glimpsed, presiding over the gloom. A strange wisp of white light came into view, bobbing briefly on the crest of the hill before it disappeared again.</p><p>With a rough grunt, Rhys shoved himself off the wall. His boots punched the ground, and he hit the trail a moment after. Most likely, he\u2019d find nothing but wind and mist, or perhaps some bats making mischief. But he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep until he\u2019d investigated.</p><p>His long strides ate up the rocky slope, and soon he\u2019d reached the top of the rise. His view of the ruins was unobstructed now\u2014at least, not obstructed by rocks anymore. A frothy mist still swirled about the place, weaving through the arches and spiraling up the lone remaining chimney.</p><p>\u201cHullo!\u201d he called out as he reached the edge of the burnt-out hall. \u201cSomeone there?\u201d</p><p>No answer. Not that he\u2019d been expecting one.</p><p>And there it was again\u2014the light. Darting and dancing in the mist, like a mischievous little piskie. That sight would have been enough to send most moorfolk fleeing for their snug thatched-roof huts. Local legend told of many an unsuspecting fellow being \u201cpiskie-led\u201d into danger.</p><p>But Rhys didn\u2019t believe in piskies or ghosts. If anything was playing tricks on him, it was just the fog. Or perhaps his memory. A lot of bad memories lived here.</p><p>Crouching, he threaded his body through the remains of a window and entered the ruin. Despite the glow of the moonlight, he wished he\u2019d brought a torch. It was darker here, inside the old walls. As though the stones sucked all the moonlight into themselves and devoured it.</p><p>Intrigued by another flash of light, he entered a mostly intact corridor. He searched his mind in vain for any memory of this place\u2014it was long and narrow, with no doors opening off it, save the two on either end. Most likely it had connected the main house with the servant quarters. He\u2019d never wandered there, never been friendly with the servants. With the exception of George Lane, he\u2019d spoken to the servants as little as possible, save the occasional churlish word when absolutely necessary. If they didn\u2019t know him, or didn\u2019t like him, his boyhood logic had argued, they wouldn\u2019t ask inconvenient questions or try to interfere.</p><p>Suddenly the wind picked up, gusting through the narrow tunnel with an almost human scream. Rhys picked up his pace, spurred by the wind\u2019s icy bite on his neck.</p><p>He stumbled a little on a bit of rock, and he swore. Why was he letting this place spook him? After all, wasn\u2019t his the spirit supposedly haunting the place? He should find nothing here to scare him, not anymore.</p><p>But against all reason, his head began to spin. He put a hand against the wall to steady himself, closing his eyes to the dark.</p><p>The more the wind blew and echoed through that corridor, the higher his hair raised along his scalp. He heard the echoes of his father\u2019s shouts, his mother\u2019s keening wail, his own startled cries. And those horses ... God, the screaming horses. Nausea churned in his gut.</p><p>Enough of this. Enough. Mysterious piskie lights be damned.</p><p>Rhys turned on his booted heel and started back down the corridor the way he\u2019d come. At some point his determined stride became a jog. He tripped over the same damn stone he\u2019d stumbled over before, this time sprawling to the ground. His knee skidded on gravel, and grit dug under his fingernails.</p><p>Stand, the voice inside him said. On your feet, brat.</p><p>Just like always, he obeyed, scrambling to his feet and running for the entrance of the corridor. Only when he reached open air did he let himself slow. He stood doubled over, hands braced on his knees, drinking great lungfuls of moorland mist. Why had he ever returned to this cursed place?</p><p>A loud clanging behind him made him jump.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d he demanded, whirling around. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>No answer. No lights. No more wind, it seemed.</p><p>Just a sudden, sharp blow to the back of his head.</p><p>The night suddenly had stars.</p><p>And the old bastard kept after him, even as he slumped to the rocky ground. Up. Get up. Stand and take another, you sniveling son of a whore.</p><p>As he spun into unconsciousness, the voice mercifully faded. And even the stars behind his eyelids went dark.</p><p>The Three Hounds was enjoying another profitable night. Meredith smiled with satisfaction at the sight of the packed public room. The men had finished the second rise on the inn\u2019s new wing today, Rhys had paid out the weekly wages, and tomorrow was Sunday, a day of rest. All were in good spirits. And with Cora behind the bar, the spirits were flowing freely.</p><p>As for Cora herself, she was laughing at something one of the men said. Her back was to Meredith, and the room was too noisy to hear, but those blond ringlets dangling from her upsweep shook merrily. All good, all good. Meredith was very pleased with how Cora\u2019s employment was working out. The girl was a bit childlike and dreamy, perhaps. But she\u2019d revealed herself to have a surprisingly good head for sums and a cheerful, friendly manner with the travelers.</p><p>And of course, she had a way with the men.</p><p>Cora possessed a soft, feminine allure that acted like a lodestone for every pair of bollocks in the vicinity. Even Meredith found herself captivated, trying to understand just what it was about the girl. It wasn\u2019t simply her pretty face. No, it was that air of wonderment she carried. She received every word a man spoke as the most fascinating bit of information imparted to humankind since the Ten Commandments, greeting the news with wide, round eyes and those slender bronze arches above them, and\u2014most importantly\u2014that breathy, feminine coo of interest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a talent, that. One Meredith had never mastered. And Cora seemed happy to discover that this talent had more honest applications than whoring.</p><p>A few reedy strains of music wafted over the din. As she made her way to the bar, Meredith spied Darryl in the corner, sawing away at his fiddle with more enthusiasm than skill.</p><p>Music, friendship, merriment, drink, flirtation\u2014the Three Hounds was a nightly party of late. The community spirit pleased Meredith greatly, as did the influx of coin. The only thing missing from the scene was Rhys.</p> <p>True to his words after church three weeks ago, Rhys had indeed been wooing her. In his own gruff, rough-hewn way. Though by night he camped out at the cottage site, he came down to the inn for dinner every evening, always bringing her some small treasure from the moor. Wildflowers were hard to come by in September, but somehow he\u2019d conjured up a few. Other days he\u2019d brought a sleek raven\u2019s feather, or a polished stone from the stream. Once, during the turning of earth for cob, he\u2019d found an odd little bronze clasp that looked worn by centuries. From the Romans\u2019 time, they\u2019d decided as they hunched over it in the light, turning it this way and that. If not earlier.</p><p>And then one night he\u2019d come in late, well after dark, plainly exhausted from a long day of labor. He\u2019d grasped her by the shoulders and pressed a warm, firm kiss to her forehead.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I have today.\u201d</p><p>That kiss had been her favorite gift of all.</p><p>And oh, how it made her yearn for more. But for all that his hard work and sweet gestures were chipping away at her own reluctance, she\u2019d yet to make a dent in his. No matter how she tempted him, directly or indirectly, after his dinner he always left and retreated to the high moor. It disappointed her, and not only because she\u2019d much rather have him sleeping in her bed. Rhys was missing out on all this nightly camaraderie. He would never truly become a part of the village and be accepted by the locals if he didn\u2019t mingle with them outside of work. Give them a chance to take his measure, not just his coin.</p> <p>Was he even giving her that chance? Even in their private conversations, Meredith realized, he always encouraged her to do most of the talking. It was only just becoming clear to her that for all she knew about him, Rhys was a difficult man to truly know. What was it he\u2019d said?</p><p>Like a damned boulder.</p><p>She\u2019d yet to find his cracks.</p><p>\u201cHow are you faring?\u201d she asked Cora as she reached the bar. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go have a cup of tea in the kitchen? I\u2019ll do the serving for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Cora blew a stray hair from her face. \u201cShall I make enough for you, too?\u201d</p><p>Meredith shook her head. \u201cNo, but my father might like a spot of tea brought up to his room. And a slice of buttered toast, perhaps.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be glad to, Mrs. Maddox.\u201d</p><p>Someone opened the door, and a cool burst of wind swept through. Meredith thought, not for the first time that evening, about Rhys sleeping out alone on the barren moor. Was he cold? Was he hungry? Was he safe? She couldn\u2019t help but worry about him.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord,\u201d Cora muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>A cheer rose up from the assembly. Meredith glimpsed Gideon by the entrance as the crowd parted around him. True to his word, he hadn\u2019t interfered with the construction plans\u2014he\u2019d even helped on occasion, hauling wagonloads of lumber and straw, along with increased amounts of ale and foodstuffs to keep the workers fed. But Meredith suspected his increased presence in the neighborhood was mostly selfish in motivation. Gideon wanted to keep a watchful eye on his smuggled goods and his enemy.</p><p>Tonight, however, he appeared to be here to have fun. Wearing a devil-may-care grin, he worked the crowd with his usual charm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like Mr. Myles?\u201d she asked Cora.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what I think of him. I can tell he doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d She wiped her hands on her apron. \u201cStruts around, orders me about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, girl,\u201d Gideon called from across the room. \u201cLook lively and pour me a brandy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee?\u201d Cora whispered. \u201cAnd the way he stares at me ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all stare at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like he does. I think he knows what I was. You know, before.\u201d</p><p>Meredith bit her lip, wishing she\u2019d never said anything to Gideon about Cora\u2019s past. \u201cTrust me,\u201d she soothed, \u201cit\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t like you. He likes you too much, that\u2019s all. You have the poor man turned arse over ears, and he\u2019s scrabbling to pretend he\u2019s still in control.\u201d</p><p>Gideon approached the bar, eyeing Cora with a lustful gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you in tonight?\u201d Meredith asked.</p><p>\u201cFor one cause and another, I feel like celebrating.\u201d His eyes never left the barmaid. \u201cThought I ordered a brandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pour it for you,\u201d Meredith interjected. \u201cCora was just going off for her break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, was she now?\u201d His jaw slid back and forth, as though he were chewing on a decision. \u201cIn that case ...\u201d</p><p>He turned, went to the largest table in the center of the room, and upended it with a spectacular crash. Meredith gasped, and Cora gave a little shriek. The men who\u2019d been huddled on stools around it all leapt to their feet. Of course, this being Gideon, they didn\u2019t argue back. But no one in the tavern\u2014Meredith included\u2014knew what the devil he meant to do.</p><p>Gideon shoved the now-vertical table to the far edge of the room, kicking the vacated stools to the sides as he went. Then he strode back to the bar. His boots echoed off the flagstones with each swaggering step. Meredith had known the man from childhood, but she\u2019d never seen such determination in his eyes, nor such raw, open yearning.</p><p>\u201cIf Miss Dunn isn\u2019t tending the bar\u201d\u2014in an explosion of agile strength, he vaulted the countertop and slid over to their side, landing between Meredith and Cora\u2014\u201cthen she\u2019s free to dance.\u201d He swept her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cOh, la.\u201d Cora\u2019s cheeks blazed red.</p><p>Well, Meredith thought to herself. Wasn\u2019t it romance the girl had been wanting?</p><p>\u201cTewkes!\u201d Gideon called, his eyes never leaving Cora\u2019s face.</p><p>In the corner, Darryl startled. \u201cAye, Mr. Myles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat fiddle you\u2019re holding. Play it.\u201d</p><p>And play it he did, lurching into a wild reel of dubious melody.</p><p>\u201cNow, then. Let\u2019s see if you can keep step.\u201d With a wide grin of encouragement, Gideon danced Cora right out from behind the bar and into the space he\u2019d cleared at the center of the room.</p><p>The men crowding the perimeter roared their approval, hiding their envy with varying degrees of success. Meredith knew they were probably all wondering why they hadn\u2019t come up with the idea themselves. Because they weren\u2019t Gideon, of course. And even if they had thought of it, none of them were so ingenious, so crafty, or so devilishly arrogant as to try.</p><p>Gideon and Cora hadn\u2019t made but a few sweeping twirls of the room, however, before the men\u2019s collective intelligence drew a new conclusion. Cora might be taken as a partner, but there was one other woman in the room.</p><p>Several pairs of ale-merry eyes turned on Meredith at once.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she laughed as Skinner came toward her, his huge mitts outstretched. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t dance.\u201d</p><p>But Gideon\u2019s outlandish display had emboldened them all. Despite her protests, Meredith found herself swept out from behind the bar and spun from partner to partner as Darryl\u2019s frantic fiddling went on. The faster they turned her, the more gaily she laughed. In the center, Cora looked similarly flushed and breathless with enjoyment. Those who weren\u2019t dancing clapped and stomped. Meredith began to fear the uproar would bring down the roof.</p><p>But then, Darryl\u2019s fiddling died a quick, mournful death, and a fresh gust of night wind froze them all in place.</p><p>Rhys stood in the tavern door. Meredith briefly wondered if the man was capable of making anything other than a dramatic entrance. Was it his sheer size, or the intensity he exuded? It certainly wasn\u2019t her imagination. Everyone in the room was transfixed.</p><p>Meredith rejoiced. His timing couldn\u2019t have been better. Rhys could join the party, socialize with villagers, and perhaps even smooth things over with Gideon. Thanks to Cora, the smuggler was in good spirits tonight.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, my lord.\u201d Though everyone else in the room remained frozen, Meredith put out her hand and crooked her finger in invitation. \u201cCome dance with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother time perhaps.\u201d</p><p>He staggered in from the night, wearing a strange expression on his face. His complexion was unnaturally pale. He looked just like the living phantom of Darryl\u2019s stories.</p><p>With one hand pressed to the back of his head, he reeled to a halt. His glassy eyes shifted from Meredith to Cora and back. \u201cAre either of you ladies handy with a needle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Meredith asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve something that needs stitching up.\u201d He pulled his hand from his head. In it, he grasped a wad of torn fabric, soaked through with blood.</p><p>At the sight, Cora shrieked. Gideon slipped a protective arm about her waist.</p><p>Rhys just stared at the bloodied rag for a moment, blinking.</p><p>Meredith started toward him. She knew that expression. Any tavernkeeper would.</p><p>He was going down, hard.</p><p>And before she could reach him, he did. His eyes rolled back in his head, and he slumped to the floor, landing with a thud that rattled the candlesticks.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>When Rhys came to for the second time that evening, he found himself slumped over a chair. The chair was backward. His legs straddled the seat, and his bare chest rested against the back. Another moment, and he\u2019d recognized his surroundings as the kitchen of the Three Hounds. He looked down to see two of the eponymous animals curled at his feet.</p><p>He blinked, and they became four.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>The dogs\u2019 ears twitched at his low cry of pain. All eight of them.</p><p>Someone was digging a needle into his scalp. His eyes told him it couldn\u2019t be Meredith, because two of her were currently adding peat to the fire.</p><p>The heat from the blaze swam before his eyes and warmed his bones, but the smoke made him gag. Rhys swallowed hard. The last thing he wanted was to retch in front of her.</p><p>\u201cOh, Rhys. Thank God you\u2019re awake,\u201d she said, noticing his next wince of pain. She took a cup from the table and waved it under his nose. \u201cLocal gin? Cures all ills.\u201d</p><p>At the smell, his stomach clenched. He declined with a careful shake of his head. \u201cJust a drop of water, if you would.\u201d</p><p>She offered him a battered tin cup, and he managed to take it in one shaking hand and lift it to his lips. \u201cSorry I interrupted the party.\u201d</p><p>Meredith pulled up a stool and sat next to him. \u201cYou gave us a fright. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought I saw a light up at the ruins. I went up to investigate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone? Unarmed?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and took another sip.</p><p>\u201cAnd ... what did you find?\u201d</p><p>Was it a trick of his bashed-in brain, or did he discern a strange note in her voice? As though she already had in mind the answer to her question.</p><p>A jab to his scalp sent the thought right out of his head.</p><p>\u201cJust one more, my lord.\u201d Cora\u2019s voice, thin with concentration. \u201cHold very still, if you please.\u201d</p><p>Rhys gritted his teeth against the pain. He\u2019d known enough pain in his life that it was sort of like crossing paths with an old acquaintance in the road. The hurt came, he acknowledged it with a jerk of his head, and then they parted ways. \u201cFound nothing but shadows, and caught a rock to the head for my trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see who did it?\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little. Only a little, because laughing hurt like the devil. \u201cCan a man see the wind? Could I grab hold of the mist? A gust of wind must have knocked a stone free. Those old walls are crumbling more with every gale.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you certain there wasn\u2019t someone there?

The moorfolk have their suspicions, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, and Gideon Myles has a passionate wish to see me dead. I know that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>Meredith circled behind him. \u201cYou do have a nice hand with stitching,\u201d she told Cora.</p><p>With a hint of pride in her voice, Cora replied, \u201cMy mum was a seamstress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bleeding\u2019s stopped. Well done. Cora, you may go close up the tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mrs. Maddox.\u201d</p> <p>Once Cora had left, Rhys heard the trickle of water. Then he felt a cool cloth pressed to his aching pate. Her fingers teased through the hair at his brow, creating ripples of sweet pleasure to counteract the pain.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep your hair cut so short?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou used to wear it long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarted shearing it close in the army. Because of the lice. Now I\u2019m just used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her fingers stilled. \u201cWell, it made Cora\u2019s work easier tonight. No amount of stitching could save your shirt, though. Went straight into the fire.\u201d She removed the damp cloth and applied a fresh one. \u201cWhen did this happen? Gideon came in tonight just a short while before you did, and he was in an unusually good mood. That is, until you stumbled through that door. He seems to have disappeared now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I was unconscious. Could have been seconds, could have been hours. But I doubt Myles had anything to do with it.

And I didn\u2019t see anyone. It was just an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you don\u2019t believe in accidents.\u201d</p> <p>Before he could argue, liquid fire tore across his scalp.</p><p>He yelped with pain. \u201cWhat the devil was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLocal gin. I told you, it cures all ills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. You might have given me warning at least.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound in her throat. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll give you a warning, Rhys St. Maur. Wind, fog, ghost, or man ... it matters not. You shouldn\u2019t be sleeping out on the moor alone. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>Rhys rested his chin on the back of the chair as the pain receded and the room came into sharper focus. He liked having her fuss over him, loved the concern in her voice. \u201cI\u2019d say you don\u2019t need to worry about me. But I rather enjoy it that you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I worry.\u201d She swabbed his neck and shoulders clean, then went to the washbasin and began to rinse her hands. \u201cJust the same as I\u2019d worry about Darryl or Cora or Father, or ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Just the same as you\u2019d worry about them?\u201d He turned to face her and noticed that her hands were shaking as she washed. \u201cOr do you worry about me differently?\u201d</p> <p>The soap slid from her grasp and landed in the basin with a splash. \u201cRhys ...\u201d</p><p>After a month of coming to understand Meredith Maddox, he knew better than to press the issue just now. He rose from his chair, slid a towel from its hook, and dried her hands himself. \u201cYou\u2019re trembling,\u201d he said. \u201cCome sit close to the fire. Let me look after you for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fit to stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fit for much of anything.\u201d He gave her his best stab at a cavalier grin. \u201cHasn\u2019t stopped me yet.\u201d</p><p>After seeing her seated by the fire, he took up the still-steaming kettle. \u201cI see Cora\u2019s made tea.\u201d He poured her a cup.</p><p>She took the cup from his hand and lifted it to her lips. \u201cI\u2019d prefer the gin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you would. And I\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t drink quite so much of it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed at him over the teacup\u2019s rim.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re concerned for me. I\u2019m not allowed to worry about you?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed her mouthful of tea. \u201cYou should stay here tonight. With me.\u201d</p><p>God. He didn\u2019t think any part of his body could throb more forcefully than his wounded pate. But he was proven wrong.</p><p>With a rough sigh, he drew up a stool and sat across from her. \u201cWhat are we to each other?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cYou want to discuss the state of our relationship?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of man enters this sort of conversation willingly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man who\u2019s tired of sleeping out on the moor alone.\u201d And not because he was worried about falling rocks or ghosts or Gideon Myles, but because he wanted her. He wanted her more than he\u2019d wanted anything in his life, and he wasn\u2019t sure how much longer he could stay away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends, Rhys. And I think I\u2019ve made it clear that we could be ... closer friends, whenever you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCloser friends,\u201d he repeated thoughtfully, reaching out to catch a loose strand of her hair. \u201cHow close?\u201d</p><p>She set aside her tea, then inched forward on her chair. His heart began to pound, just from her nearness.</p><p>\u201cVery close,\u201d she whispered, leaning in. Her lips brushed his. \u201cBody to body.\u201d Another kiss. \u201cSkin to skin.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop himself. He slid both hands to her waist and pulled her into his lap. She straddled his hips, locking her arms around his neck. Their mouths came together, open and willing and ready to meld into one.</p><p>And even though his eyes were closed, for a moment Rhys felt like his double vision had returned\u2014because her hands were everywhere. There had to be more than two of them. He felt her grasping at his shoulders, cupping his face, clutching his neck. Not to be outdone, he cinched his arms around her and pulled her flush against his bare chest, anchoring her there with his forearms while his hands slid up to her hair.</p><p>Ah, her hair. So abundant, so soft. He thrust his hands in that thick, dark mane, sifting the strands through his fingers, and then grasping big handfuls close to her scalp and twisting, just a little, to repay her for that trick with the gin.</p><p>She moaned around his tongue. Bracing her hands on his shoulders, she rocked her hips.</p><p>And now it was his turn to moan.</p><p>She made a slow circle with her pelvis, grinding against his arousal. Much as he hated relinquishing his grip on her hair, he slid his hands to her hips and grabbed tight, dragging her over his hard length again. He needed this, he needed more of it ... He just needed, so damn much. To feel good, for a change. To make her feel good, too.</p><p>He had a fresh head wound, and she\u2019d been working hard from dawn to dusk and beyond\u2014but all he could think of was getting under her skirt and working her all night long.</p><p>She writhed against him as they kissed, her motions increasingly frantic. He guided her hips with his hands, pressing her closer, increasing the friction, setting a firm, brisk rhythm.</p><p>Close friends, had she said? Well, Rhys was getting all kinds of close. And judging by the little mewling sounds she made in the back of her throat, so was she. Now it was just a race to the finish, and by God he wanted her to win. He wanted to give her pleasure even more desperately than he craved his own release. And he craved his own release more than he wanted air.</p><p>With a sudden gasp, she pulled back. \u201cWe can\u2019t, not here,\u201d she panted. \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d</p><p>He sat stunned, open-mouthed, his lungs seizing and his loins painfully bereft of contact.</p><p>\u201cCome along.\u201d She tugged at him.</p><p>After a moment, he released a curse and a sigh. Ten seconds ago, if she\u2019d shoved aside her petticoats and hiked up her skirts, he would have buried himself in her warm, wet body without a moment\u2019s hesitation. But a few seconds of separation and the renewed pounding in his head, combined with the prospect of that long flight of stairs ... There were just enough obstacles to his bounding lust that his tortoise-like intelligence managed to catch up. \u201cIt isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI know. Too many clothes between us. Let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d She kissed his neck.</p><p>His hands went to her shoulders. \u201cNo,\u201d he repeated, pushing her back. \u201cIt still won\u2019t be enough. Body to body, skin to skin. It\u2019s not enough. I don\u2019t want ... friendship without clothing. I need a marriage.\u201d</p><p>She traced the line of his jaw. \u201cWhy must you always be thinking of the future? Just think of tonight.\u201d</p><p>Damn his eyes, how ironic. For so many years he\u2019d never considered the future. Not once. In fact, he\u2019d spent a great deal of effort and spilled a great deal of blood\u2014his and others\u2019\u2014trying to ensure there wouldn\u2019t be a future, not for him. And now ... now he had plans and desires, and a half-built cottage up on that slope. A future. He couldn\u2019t simply give that up, collapse it all to one fleeting night of pleasure with no promise of more.</p><p>\u201cI am thinking of tonight.\u201d His voice was a low rasp. \u201cI am thinking\u2014in shameless detail\u2014of taking you upstairs, stripping you bare, and doing unspeakable things to you all night long. Touching you everywhere. Tasting you everywhere. And I know, as sure as I know my own name, it still won\u2019t be enough. I will want you again tomorrow, and then the day after that, and again and again and again. That\u2019s why I need those vows. I need to hear you say you\u2019re mine forever before I have you at all. Because I know I will never, ever get enough.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. A whole parade of emotions marched through those silvery eyes. Surprise, desire, vulnerability, disappointment ... something he fancied might be genuine affection.</p><p>\u201cHow can you say such things to a woman and not take her directly to bed?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s cruel, I tell you. Cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cruel, cruel world,\u201d he teased. In a serious tone, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s not only about bedding you, I hope you know. I want to take care of you. I can\u2019t bear to see you working so hard.\u201d He cast a glance around the humble kitchen. \u201cOnce we\u2019re married, I\u2019ll rescue you from all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be rescued from all this. This is my life. I enjoy working here, just as you\u2019ve enjoyed building that house.\u201d Her hand went to his wounded head. \u201cIf anyone needs rescuing, it\u2019s you. You\u2019re in danger here, the longer you stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep telling you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep telling me you\u2019re indestructible. And I\u2019m telling you, I just scraped your unconscious body off the floor.\u201d Her hands laced behind his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t go back to the moor alone. Stay with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He stood, setting her on her feet as he did. \u201cI should be going.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t imagine staying under this roof without bedding her. And this night was not going to be their first night. Just as well. With his throbbing head, he wouldn\u2019t have been in top lovemaking form.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right out there,\u201d he assured her. \u201cJust two more weeks, two more rises\u2014and the walls will be done. The paring and timbers ... another week, maybe. Then all it will need is some thatch and a few coats of limewash. Well, and window glass, doors, shutters. And furnishings. I\u2019ll be making some trips to Plymouth over the next few weeks, to place orders.\u201d</p><p>Calming, she made a slow circle of the room. \u201cThere are things I\u2019ll be needing for the new guest rooms, too.\u201d She smoothed her hair with her hands. \u201cWhen you go, may I send a list with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>She began ticking items off on her fingers. \u201cOld Mr. Farrell will make me the furniture, but I\u2019ll be needing mattresses. And washbasins, chamber pots, fabric for bedding and curtains ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait, wait. I know nothing about fabrics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know nothing about Plymouth. I\u2019ve never been farther than Tavistock. And ...\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t really know what a guest of quality expects, anyhow. I mean, I try to ask roundabout, when travelers come through. But you\u2019re a lord. You\u2019ve traveled all over England and the Continent besides. You\u2019ll know far better than I how to select quality goods.\u201d</p><p>The idea struck him\u2014so swift, so brilliant\u2014his head ached with it. A smile pulled at his mouth as he massaged his pounding temple. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to come with me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cTo Plymouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not to Plymouth. If you want guest rooms fit for people of quality, you ought to go where they go, shop where they shop. You\u2019ll come with me to Bath.\u201d</p><p>Oh, it was so beautiful\u2014that bright shimmer of excitement in her eyes, before her practical nature doused it.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad? I can\u2019t go to Bath. It must be two days\u2019 journey in either direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hire a coach to drive us straight through. If we leave before dawn, we can manage it in one day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what of the inn? Who\u2019ll take care of the inn?\u201d</p><p>Rhys looked toward the bar. \u201cWho\u2019s taking care of it right now? You said yourself Cora\u2019s doing well. Between her and Darryl and your father, they\u2019ll manage without you for a few days.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms. \u201cWe can\u2019t travel alone together. It\u2019s not proper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho in this village is going to care? But if you\u2019re anxious about how it will look to strangers, we\u2019ll present ourselves as a married couple at the hotel. For appearances only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor appearances only?\u201d She arched a brow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be a perfect gentleman. You did want romance.\u201d Oh, yes. This was how he was going to get everything he wanted. Meredith\u2019s body and her troth. By giving her a taste of her future life as Lady Ashworth.</p> <p>\u201cA perfect gentleman? Truly?\u201d She leaned one hip on the counter. \u201cDo you really think you\u2019ll be able to spend all day with me in a private coach, then night after night in the same room, with one bed, and still resist temptation?\u201d</p><p>He pretended to think on it. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come with me, then?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, I\u2019ll come with you. Fool that I am. I\u2019d like to see Bath once in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only the beginning,\u201d he told her. \u201cThere are so many places we could travel together. We could see the country, Merry. The Continent too, if you like. There\u2019s a whole world out there to be discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. There\u2019s a whole world out there. And the one place I\u2019m interested in discovering with you is the underside of a bedsheet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand they have bedsheets in Bath.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cOne night, Rhys. Your perfect gentleman act won\u2019t last. You\u2019ll be sharing my bed before the night\u2019s out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on it. Because I know your innkeeping aspirations won\u2019t survive a day beyond the borders of this village. Before the night\u2019s out, we\u2019ll be officially engaged.\u201d</p><p>There. The battle lines were drawn. They just stood there for a moment, gazing at each other and letting all that pent-up sensual excitement prickle over and around and between them, like electric fluid in a thundercloud.</p><p>\u201cThis is fun,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d He gestured into the space between them. \u201cJust this.\u201d</p><p>It was fun. It was near-unbearable, the tension between them, and possibly doing irreparable damage to his breeding organs. But it was also wonderful, and something he\u2019d never experienced before. She wanted him, he wanted her, and the air around them just smoked with it. This was the force making him feel so alive, so driven, so directed toward a goal.</p><p>Because she was his future. And somewhere, deep down, despite all her protests, she knew it too.</p><p>With a dry smile and a mock salute, he turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cRhys?\u201d</p><p>He stopped. An absurd hope bloomed in his chest, that maybe she\u2019d finally acknowledge it, give in. The trip to Bath could be their honeymoon.</p><p>\u201cTake the hounds with you?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep better if I know you\u2019re not alone.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and whistled to the dogs. Not quite what he\u2019d been hoping for, but he\u2019d take it. For now.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>\u201cOh, ma\u2019am. It does look well on you. You\u2019d hardly know it was a strumpet\u2019s gown.\u201d \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Meredith fretted in the predawn darkness, twisting and turning before the mirror. This was the largest looking glass in the inn\u2014the one adorning her finest guest room\u2014and still she couldn\u2019t get a sufficiently reassuring view.</p><p>Proper-sized mirrors, she mentally added to her shopping list.</p><p>It had been two weeks since Rhys had issued the invitation to Bath. Why had she waited until the last possible moment to pack?</p><p>\u201cThe color\u2019s lovely,\u201d she said, running her hands over the ruby-red silk. Did genteel women truly wear such colors? \u201cAre you absolutely certain I won\u2019t look like a whore? That wouldn\u2019t do at all.\u201d She threw Cora a guilty look. \u201cThat is ... I beg your pardon, dear.\u201d</p><p>Cora smiled. \u201cNo need, Mrs. Maddox. I understand perfectly.\u201d</p><p>Did she? Well, in that case, Meredith wished the girl would enlighten her. For she scarcely understood herself at all. Here she was leaving tomorrow morning to travel alone with a gentleman for several days, with the express purpose of making love to him several times, and no intention to allow said activities to culminate in marriage. And she was concerned that a red dress might make her look the tart?</p><p>She tugged up on the neckline. \u201cI need a fichu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, ma\u2019am. The cut is not so very low, and your ...\u201d The girl\u2019s voice died, and she cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t have so very much to put on display.\u201d Meredith smiled, patting her modest bosom. \u201cOf course, you\u2019re right. And you\u2019ve done a fine job with the fitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much to alter, save the hem. You and the owner had quite similar measurements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t your dress, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I never had anything half so fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where did it come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Mr. Bellamy had me staying at the Blue Turtle in Hounslow, there was a lord and his mistress stopping over. Well, the two of them had a noisy row right in the middle of the courtyard, in the wee hours of the morning. He\u2019d cast her out into the cold, then flung her dresses out the window.\u201d</p><p>Cora shook her head. \u201cThat was the scene that made me realize I never wanted to be any man\u2019s whore again. The lady who owned these dresses, she had what all us girls wanted\u2014a wealthy protector to buy her nice things and treat her well. And still, when he had no more use for her, he cast her out like rubbish. I didn\u2019t want that to ever be me.\u201d</p><p>A little smile curved Cora\u2019s lips. \u201cEvidently, the fancy lady had too much pride to pick her garments out of the mud. She simply left them on the ground and ordered her carriage, and that was that. So I gathered them up, brushed out the dirt as best I could. I planned to make them over for myself someday, but they suit you better.\u201d She carefully folded a leaf-green muslin frock edged with ecru lace and laid it in Meredith\u2019s trunk. \u201cThere\u2019s this, too, for the daytime. And a traveling cloak.\u201d</p><p>Touched, Meredith caught the girl in a warm hug. \u201cThank you. You\u2019ll have the dresses back, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did leave the excess inside the seams, just in case,\u201d Cora admitted, reaching to undo the row of tiny closures down the gown\u2019s back.</p><p>As Cora helped her change from the red silk gown into her plain, serviceable traveling habit, Meredith drilled the girl on all the details of minding the inn. Where to find the extra stores of Madeira if wealthy guests happened through, how to start watering down the drinks a good hour before closing, and where to find Skinner\u2019s mother if he had one of his bad nights.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so anxious, ma\u2019am,\u201d Cora said, packing away the silk gown. \u201cWith Mr. Lane and Darryl and Mrs. Ware all helping, we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Meredith wished she could tell her to call on Gideon Myles in an emergency, but she couldn\u2019t trust him anymore. They\u2019d scarcely spoken two words in the weeks since Rhys\u2019s \u201caccident\u201d at the ruins. Much as Meredith hated to believe Gideon was responsible, it was the only explanation that fit.</p><p>As Rhys said, his attacker certainly could have finished the job, so clearly the incident had been meant as a warning. Not just a warning to Rhys, but a warning to her. Only a few weeks remained of the two months\u2019 grace Gideon had extended. The other night, she\u2019d worried aloud to Rhys that Gideon might make good on his threat to kill him, if he didn\u2019t leave the village soon.</p><p>Rhys had only laughed, much to her dismay. He refused to see Gideon as a threat. While Meredith had no doubt that Rhys would come out the victor in a fair fight between the men, this wasn\u2019t an army skirmish or a boxing match. Gideon had time to bide, knowledge of the terrain, loyal men to assist him. The ambush at the ruins proved all too well that Rhys was not as indestructible as he claimed. As she knew from experience, she couldn\u2019t bear to stand helplessly by while he courted death.</p><p>There was a knock at the door just as Meredith finished tying the traveling cloak in front. Before she could even call, \u201cCome in,\u201d her father entered.</p><p>\u201cFather.\u201d She kissed his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re up early.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course I am. Did you think I wouldn\u2019t see you off?\u201d He patted her arm. \u201cAnd I wanted to talk to you, just a minute, before you go.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, making a great effort not to openly cringe. She hoped he didn\u2019t mean to discuss the implications\u2014moral or otherwise\u2014of her traveling alone with Rhys. They\u2019d never spoken of Maddox, not in any marital context at least, and though Meredith supposed her father must know she\u2019d taken a few lovers since her husband\u2019s death, they\u2019d mercifully never discussed that, either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll carry your valise down, Mrs. Maddox.\u201d With that, Cora left them alone.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit,\u201d she said, guiding him to the bed.</p><p>He sat beside her on the edge of the mattress, using his arms to settle his weight. The worse of his crippled legs extended at an awkward angle. Since the fire, when his leg was crushed by the weight of a burning rafter, he\u2019d never regained the ability to bend it properly at the knee. Her heart twisted in her chest. After so many years, she suspected he\u2019d learned to ignore his injuries better than she had.</p><p>The old man\u2019s face was very grave. \u201cMeredith ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay,\u201d she said, clasping his hand. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to go, only say the word, and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d He gave a gravelly chuckle. \u201cGo, child. Enjoy yourself. I wish I\u2019d been able to do this for you, for your mother. You deserve a holiday far grander than this. What I wanted to say was just ...\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cRhys is a good man, Merry. He\u2019s had a hard time of it, but his heart is in the right place. Give him a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Father,\u201d she whispered. A bittersweet smile tugged the corners of her mouth. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019d like nothing better. It\u2019s Rhys who doesn\u2019t believe in chance.\u201d She squeezed his hand and whispered, \u201cMay I ask a favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you happen to see Gideon while I\u2019m gone, make this little speech to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to leave?\u201d Rhys appeared in the doorway, dressed for travel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Father stood and greeted him warmly. Meanwhile, Meredith took advantage of the diversion to discreetly swipe at her eyes. If Rhys did leave Buckleigh-in-the-Moor, her father would be so disappointed.</p><p>Between Rhys, Gideon, her father, the inn, the village\u2014Meredith felt her loyalties stretched in too many directions of late. At night, she lay wrung out and restless in her bed, racking her mind for a solution. A way to keep everyone happy and secure. No answer had come to her yet.</p><p>Farewells were exchanged in the first gloom of dawn. Rhys handed her into the carriage, settling her on the front-facing seat. He spoke a few words to the coachman, heaved his weight onto the opposite bench, gave the carriage roof a smart rap ... and then they were under way. The hounds yipped after them, chasing them all the way out of the village. Poor beasts, they\u2019d probably miss Rhys far more than they\u2019d miss her. They\u2019d grown quite attached to him in recent weeks.</p> <p>Meredith\u2019s stomach danced with every swaying motion of the coach, and excitement fizzed through her veins. She stretched her fingers inside her traveling gloves, and the seams chafed her work-roughened hands.</p><p>Here we go, she told herself, as the village\u2019s last thatched roof rolled past. This is really happening. She was truly departing Buckleigh-in-the-Moor, and not for a half-day\u2019s bartering in Tavistock, but for an indulgent stay in Bath. Best of all, she was going there with Rhys. She resolved to leave all her worries in the village, where they belonged, and simply enjoy these precious days. A giddy smile stretched her face, and she unglued her gaze from the small window in order to share it with him.</p><p>He was asleep. Arms folded, chin tucked to his chest. Boots propped possessively on her seat, but thoughtfully well clear of her skirts. The coach swung into a turn, and a low, soft snore rumbled from his chest.</p><p>She pressed her wrist to her mouth to keep from laughing.</p><p>Well, he was a soldier. She supposed he could nap anywhere. And since she knew his sleep to be all-too-often disturbed by unpleasant dreams, she didn\u2019t want to rob him of his well-earned rest. Not presently, anyhow. If she had anything to say about it, he\u2019d be getting little sleep in Bath.</p> <p>But for her part, Meredith could scarcely bring herself to blink. As dawn warmed the countryside, she kept her face pressed to the window glass, the better to greedily consume every detail. She\u2019d never passed by this route before, and she might pass a lifetime without traveling it again.</p><p>After some time, the carriage lurched to a halt. Rhys woke with a start. His boots hit the carriage floor with a jarring thud.</p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s well,\u201d she assured him quickly. \u201cI believe we\u2019re stopping to change horses.\u201d</p><p>He glanced out the window. \u201cWe\u2019re nearing Exeter. That\u2019s good. Shall we climb out and stretch?\u201d</p><p>They walked a bit, away from the inn, strolling through the fringe of a wooded glen that bordered the lane. It amazed her, what a short distance they\u2019d traveled and yet how many plants grew here that she did not know by name.</p><p>\u201cWe never talk about you,\u201d she said, taking his arm. And their opportunities to do so might be dwindling by the day.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course there is. You\u2019ve traveled all over. What\u2019s the most beautiful place you\u2019ve ever been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere you are.\u201d</p><p>She blushed like a girl, despite herself. \u201cThis from the man who claims no talent for romance. No, be serious. I truly want to know. French mountain ranges? A Belgian cathedral? The open sea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTulips.\u201d He lifted his chin and stared hard into the thickening trees. The pause grew so lengthy, Meredith wondered whether he meant to say anything else. Perhaps he just had a particular fondness for tulips.</p><p>\u201cA whole field of them,\u201d he finally said. \u201cIn Holland. Red tulips, in endless waves. And a clear blue sky overhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d A dull note landed on the word was. Looking over his shoulder, he said, \u201cI believe they have the new team harnessed.\u201d</p> <p>And that was the end of that.</p><p>As the coach got under way a second time, he stacked his arms on his chest and propped his boots beside her, as though he would sleep again. But this time, she did not hesitate to interrupt.</p><p>\u201cTulips,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they\u2019re the most beautiful sight. What about the ugliest?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cEven if I could decide between the many contenders for that distinction ... I\u2019d never answer you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever? Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you should never witness the hell of war. You shouldn\u2019t even hear about it secondhand. That\u2019s the whole reason we were fighting, to spare innocent people like you such ugliness. I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll personally acquaint you with it now.\u201d He turned his head to the window. End of discussion.</p><p>She sighed, wishing he wouldn\u2019t close himself off to her. If he only knew how much of his pain she\u2019d already witnessed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your service. For fighting. I\u2019d imagine you don\u2019t hear that enough.\u201d At least, he likely hadn\u2019t heard it from anyone in the village, including her. \u201cYour regiment was England\u2019s most decorated, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read it in the newspaper once.\u201d Or twice. Or several dozen times.</p><p>\u201cI had the honor to serve with many good, valiant men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were one of those good, valiant men. You led them.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m here. Far too many of them aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t dare admit it, but she knew every last ribbon and medal and citation he\u2019d been awarded. They numbered almost as many as his scars. The thought that he\u2019d incurred them all with the vague idea he\u2019d be sparing her and others a bit of ugliness ...</p><p>\u201cI admire you,\u201d she said.</p><p>The poor man. He looked utterly panicked. As if she\u2019d lobbed him a snarling weasel, rather than an honest compliment. Actually, he probably would have dealt with the weasel more handily.</p><p>\u201cTruly, Rhys. I admire you. And I wish you\u2019d allow yourself more credit for everything you\u2019ve accomplished, instead of throwing it back on fate all the time.\u201d She gave him a sly smile. \u201cAnd to that end, I think I\u2019ll honor you by hanging a plaque in the tavern, engraved with your name and rank. Our local war hero.\u201d</p><p>He just laughed and rubbed his eyes. \u201cThere are all kinds of courage in the world, and most of it takes place far from battlefields.\u201d His gaze caught hers, warm and honest. \u201cThat whole inn is a monument to your bravery, Meredith Lane Maddox. And I\u2019m going to buy you every ribbon in Bath.\u201d</p><p>Oh. A lump formed in her throat. And her heart ... her heart just melted. It meant so much, that he recognized the hard work and love she\u2019d poured into that place.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He leaned forward until his knees knocked against hers. \u201cWhat\u2019s troubling you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a bit fatigued,\u201d she lied.</p><p>He crossed to sit beside her, putting an arm about her shoulder and drawing her head to his chest. She breathed deeply, enjoying his comforting male scent.</p><p>\u201cThere, now,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen sleep. You\u2019ve all day to rest.\u201d</p><p>They fell into an easy, companionable silence, which somehow spoke more eloquently than any of their conversations. Impulsively, she reached out to take his free hand in hers. Their fingers tangled. His thumb settled over her wrist, and her pulse pounded against it. She couldn\u2019t help but lean against him and snuggle into his warmth, under the guise of sleeping. But she was doing no such thing. She was wide awake, unwilling to miss a single moment. Scenery in entirely new shades of green was flitting by outside, and she might never have another chance to view it, but she couldn\u2019t be bothered to lift her cheek from his lapel. Instead, she closed her eyes, scrupulously memorizing each sensation he caused within her. Every yearning, every thrill, every ache.</p><p>This, too, was the experience of a lifetime.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>With dry roads in their favor, they reached Bath just as the late summer sun kissed the horizon. Rhys was well pleased with the fair weather, and with his fair companion. Meredith remained pasted to the window as they drove through the city, eyes wide and lips parted. As though it were not enough to look her fill of the surrounding landscape\u2014she must drink and breathe it, too.</p><p>He watched her as intently as she watched the scenery rolling past, smiling to himself all the while.</p><p>When they arrived at the hotel, he was forced to abandon the pleasant occupation of noting her every gasp of wonder and reluctant blink. After procuring the finest suite of rooms, as previously arranged, he directed the footmen to unload the valises. He reserved for himself the pleasure of handing Meredith down from the coach.</p><p>\u201cGood heavens,\u201d she breathed, staring up at the hotel\u2019s Roman-styled fa\u00e7ade, all Bath stone columns and carved balustrades.</p><p>\u201cIt gets even better inside.\u201d</p><p>She said not a word as a servant led them through the entrance hall, up a carpeted staircase, and down to the very end of the corridor. Rhys allowed her to pass through the door first, then followed her into the suite. The servants followed soon thereafter, and he exchanged a few words with them as they deposited the baggage.</p><p>Once they\u2019d left, he turned to Meredith. There she stood in the center of the sitting room, a smudge of gray wool and dark hair against the cream-colored walls and carpet. She just remained there, perfectly still, hands clasped and eyes wide. Silent.</p><p>Rhys frowned. Her amazement had been entertaining to view earlier, but this continued silence was beginning to concern him. \u201cMerry? Are you well?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI may cry.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cIs that good or bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201d She swallowed hard, then pressed both hands to her cheeks as she tilted her neck to view the elaborate carved ceiling.</p><p>He took a step toward her. \u201cIs there something wrong with the rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>Now he was thoroughly confused.</p><p>She finally took pity on him and explained. \u201cRhys, this suite is ... stunning. Elegant. Palatial. It\u2019s enough to throw me into abject despair. If these are the sort of accommodations to which people of rank are accustomed, how can I ever hope to appease them at the Three Hounds? Why, one of the inn\u2019s new bedchambers would likely fit in that closet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d Sniffing, she turned to him. \u201cJust look at this place. How can the inn ever hope to compete with establishments such as these?\u201d</p><p>So. The superior quality of the place had her upset, not some deficiency. Smiling with relief, he crossed to her side and slid an arm around her shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry. You\u2019re not competing with establishments like this one. This is one of the grandest hotels in all England. A resort for the country\u2019s wealthiest lords and ladies. The Three Hounds is a coaching inn. Even the nobility have modest expectations when it comes to coaching inns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cI see. So I still have some hope of meeting those \u2018modest expectations\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Tsking softly, he squeezed her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re already exceeding them.\u201d When her shoulder muscles remained tense under his fingers, he added, \u201cI\u2019ve ordered a hot bath and a hot meal sent up. I know you find this suite devastating in its refinement, but try not to fling yourself off the balcony.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and brightened instantly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know I\u2019m being ridiculous.\u201d Turning in his embrace, she kissed his cheek. \u201cThank you. It\u2019s simply magnificent.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s better.\u201d He released her, giving her an affectionate pat on the backside, and she immediately left his side to begin a closer inspection of a decorative alcove.</p><p>\u201cShould I call for a servant to help you unpack?\u201d he asked, crossing to their baggage where it sat by a large wardrobe. \u201cOr do you trust me to play lady\u2019s maid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you like,\u201d she muttered distractedly, craning her neck to peer atop a high shelf and testing its cleanliness with her fingertip.</p> <p>Rhys doubted she\u2019d heard a word he\u2019d said, but he took it upon himself to unpack the valises. The army had given him years of experience in packing and unpacking quickly. After shrugging out of his greatcoat, he set to work. He shook out and refolded their inner garments, then hung his coats next to her gowns. Of course, he had separate closets planned for the cottage, but he had to admit\u2014he liked seeing their clothing mingled in the same wardrobe, her stockings nestled next to his cravats. It looked right, and\u2014if a hulking brute of man like him could say such a thing\u2014it looked sweet.</p><p>It also aroused him something fierce.</p><p>As he worked, Meredith made a slow circuit of the sitting room. She stopped to peer at each small object, inspected each stick of furniture and decorative detail. He could sense her making mental notes, storing up ideas and inspiration to bring home to the Three Hounds.</p><p>\u201cI could never hang velvet drapes at the inn,\u201d she lamented, fingering the edge of one dark blue curtain. \u201cThe dust would be horrible.\u201d Her head tilted. \u201cBut I do like the way they\u2019ve hung these draperies near the ceiling and let them fall almost to the ground. Makes the window appear larger than it is. I\u2019ll have to remember that.\u201d</p><p>Chewing her lip with concentration, she wandered off into the bedchamber.</p> <p>Rhys sighed. When was she going to realize that a return to innkeeping wasn\u2019t in her future? With an impatient yank, he dragged a pale, gauzy shift free of her valise. He wished she would cease paying so much attention to the furnishings and spare a thought for him.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>Her exclamation of surprise tugged him across the room. From the arch separating sitting room and bedchamber, he spied her at the side of the bed.</p><p>The enormous bed. The carved mahogany posts were hung with rich draping, and the bed itself was a billowing cloud of snow-white pillows and counterpanes.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat a bed. I\u2019ve never seen its like.\u201d Placing both hands flat on the mattress, she leaned forward, testing its softness and give. As she bounced her arms up and down, her bosom and backside teetered cheekily, as if in invitation.</p><p>Rhys\u2019s hands fisted in the tissue-thin muslin, wrinkling it irrevocably. He cleared his throat. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>She turned and looked at him. Her dark eyebrows rose, as though she expected him to go on.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have a damn thing else to say. The only word in his brain was yes. Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>Well, and perhaps the word now.</p><p>She knew it, too. Those slender brows arched with amusement. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, hiking her heavy traveling skirt and lifting one hip onto the mattress. \u201cIt is indeed a remarkable bed.\u201d</p><p>Transferring her weight to that hip perched on the edge of the bed, she slowly reclined sideways, stretching out her arm as she did. It was a slow, sinuous motion, like that of a cat stretching into a patch of sun. Propping herself on an elbow, she made her body one long, dark ribbon of femininity unfurled atop the fringed white cushions.</p><p>At last. Now he had her complete, undivided attention.</p><p>His heart battered his ribs, threatening to splinter apart the old, imperfectly healed bones. Other parts of him stiffened to iron.</p><p>She gave him a coy, seductive smile. \u201cWon\u2019t you join me?\u201d</p> <p>Rhys\u2019s mouth went dry. Despite all his intentions to wait, to tease, to ply her with ruthless, exquisite temptation, and finally seduce her into a formal engagement ... they\u2019d been here five minutes and he was the one with yes on his lips. Yes, yes, yes. He could not have said anything else.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless to resist,\u201d she said in a sultry voice, picking open the top button of her jacket. \u201cWe both know you\u2019ll give in.\u201d She hooked her finger under the second button and gave it a playful tug. \u201cI\u2019m a woman, Rhys. When it comes to the bedroom, my will is stronger than yours.\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little. But the words gave him pause.</p><p>On instinct, he should have dismissed the idea out of hand. No one\u2019s will was stronger than his. That was why he\u2019d survived so many fights. Hadn\u2019t he spent eleven years in the infantry, always charging into the first wave of blood, hoping to meet a stronger opponent? The man who would knock him to the ground and finally end it all, at last.</p><p>It had never happened.</p><p>Until now. And it wasn\u2019t a man threatening to vanquish him with sabre or musket, but a woman. A woman with curves of satin and a spine of pure steel. Give in, she said. My will is stronger than yours.</p><p>On this point, he suspected she was right. His resolve was quickly softening, even as his groin went rock-hard. Wasn\u2019t this precisely what he\u2019d spent a lifetime chasing? Sweet, blessed defeat?</p><p>And to find it on such a lush, silky field of battle ...</p><p>Destiny whispered in his ear. She was beautiful, and she was his for the taking. Whether it happened today or next year, this was fated to be.</p><p>He would have her. Today. Yes.</p><p>Yes, yes, yes. And now.</p><p>With a deep, resonant sigh, he stepped toward her.</p><p>Her expression changed quickly, from one of seduction to one of surprise. Despite her teasing, she hadn\u2019t expected him to give in.</p><p>He stopped. He hadn\u2019t expected her to be surprised.</p><p>Tenderness warmed her eyes. In a generous, fluid motion, she reached out a hand and beckoned. \u201cOh, Rhys,\u201d she whispered. The words were so soft they might have been a caress. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>A sharp rap at the door halted him mid-step.</p><p>God damn it. Fate was playing cruel games with him tonight.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be our dinner,\u201d he said. He muttered to himself, \u201cBlast it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur dinner. And our bath?\u201d She rose to a sitting position.</p><p>Our bath. Well, there was a happier thought.</p><p>Rhys twisted the muslin in his hands, wondering which would be worse\u2014answering the door with a wad of frilly muslin in front of his groin? Or greeting the servants with an obvious erection?</p><p>Smiling at his predicament, Meredith saved him by answering the door herself. Rhys took his turn studying the draperies as a parade of maids bearing steaming pitchers marched through the suite, each adding her cargo to the rapidly filling tub. He pretended to admire the view of the park as a manservant wheeled a small table into the sitting room, whisking away silver dome after silver dome to reveal a feast.</p><p>\u201cThank you, that will be all.\u201d Meredith\u2019s voice. And then the soft snick of the door.</p><p>Releasing his breath, Rhys turned to her. Grinning sheepishly, he held up the abused, twisted nightrail for her inspection before tossing it aside. \u201cYou won\u2019t be needing it anyway.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cI won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cSo, how do we proceed? Do we eat first? Bathe?\u201d Sparkling eyes met his. \u201cNeither?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner first,\u201d he said, drawing two chairs up to the table. \u201cThen bath. Once I have you in bed, I\u2019m keeping you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I like the sound of that.\u201d Her cheeks pinked as she settled into her chair and raised a glass of wine. \u201cShall we have a toast?\u201d</p><p>He raised his own claret. \u201cTo the lovely Mrs. St. Maur, Lady Ashworth. And to a most enjoyable honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cBe serious, Rhys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am perfectly serious.\u201d He waited for her defensive laughter to cease. \u201cAs far as society\u2019s concerned, you\u2019re here in this room as my wife. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, this night is the beginning of forever.\u201d</p><p>She made a strange sound in her throat as she studied her wine. At length, she put it down. The glass met the table\u2019s surface with a clink.</p><p>\u201cMeredith, what is the matter?\u201d</p><p>She picked up her knife and fork and began to eat.</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d he insisted. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just ... I\u2019m not your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be.\u201d He jabbed at a hunk of beef, and his fork screeched across the plate. \u201cListen, Meredith. Life\u2019s made you cautious, I know. And I know I was gone for fourteen years and I\u2019ve only been back for a matter of weeks. Some reluctance is understandable, and I\u2019ve been prepared to wait it out. But surely by now you have to know I\u2019m not just some randy traveler passing through the inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know that.\u201d She chased a pea around her plate.</p><p>\u201cDo you? I\u2019ve had the banns read, twice, in front of the whole village. Threats, vandals, rocks to the head\u2014I\u2019ve endured all of these in recent weeks, and none of them have shaken my plans to rebuild Nethermoor, nor my belief that we\u2019re meant to marry. But you still don\u2019t trust me on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what? Marriage?\u201d She raised her eyebrows and her voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me on the subject either. If you did, you\u2019d offer me a real choice in the matter. I don\u2019t recall ever being asked if I\u2019d like to marry you, simply told that it\u2019s inevitable. Instead of a proposal, I get ... autocratic commands and prophetic pronouncements. Where\u2019s the trust in that?\u201d</p><p>Rhys shook his head. \u201cEat,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe bathwater\u2019s going cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Let\u2019s not argue.\u201d She gave him a self-effacing smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll laugh about this in the morning.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. Was that what she thought? That everything would change by the morning? Maybe this was the source of her reluctance. She thought that his determination to marry her would disappear once he\u2019d purged the lust from his system.</p><p>Well. He\u2019d simply have to prove to her that those fears were groundless. And the way to do so was to make love to her tonight, make it very, very good, and show her none of his intentions had changed the next morning.</p><p>Not exactly a chore, that.</p><p>He ate quickly, as always. When he looked up from his plate, he found her watching him, circling the rim of her wineglass with a fingertip.</p><p>\u201cAre you finished?\u201d he asked, wiping his mouth with a linen napkin.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She rose from her seat.</p><p>\u201cNow, can we make the bath just as speedy as the meal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we bathe together, we can.\u201d</p><p>Rhys rather liked that suggestion. Parts of him liked it very well indeed.</p><p>He ushered her over to the bathing area, where she spent a good minute cooing over the glazed ceramic tiles and painted washbasin while she removed her hairpins at the vanity.</p><p>While her attention was diverted, Rhys took the opportunity to quickly and discreetly undress. No matter how many times she assured him she wasn\u2019t repulsed by his scars, that she found his body\u2014against all reason\u2014attractive, he still felt apprehensive about revealing all of himself. She\u2019d seen him shirtless, but full nudity was another thing altogether. Between the lamps and the mirrors and the glittering white tile, there was simply too much light bouncing around, eager to illuminate his every flaw and imperfection.</p><p>And his body had a great many flaws and imperfections.</p><p>Once bared, he crossed the room silently and moved to stand behind her at the vanity. There was a mirror there, and she didn\u2019t startle. She must have watched him approach. Placing his hands on her shoulders, he pivoted her away from the mirror, not wanting to see his own damaged face staring back at him. She leaned back against him, settling her weight against his bare chest.</p><p>Rhys sucked in his breath. He reached his arms around her, and with stiff, clumsy fingers, he yanked at the closures of her traveling jacket. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sighing, she leaned forward and lowered her arms so he could shake the jacket free. He cast it aside and started on the buttons of her crisp, high-necked chemisette. Her breathing came more quickly now. His fingers worked lower, and lower still, and her breasts rose and fell. As though they were as eager to be displayed as he was to view them.</p><p>When he\u2019d eased the last tiny button free, he drew the halves of her chemisette to the sides, baring her creamy neck and chest, her small breasts covered by the frailest layer of muslin and supported by tightly laced stays. The dark valley between her breasts held secrets and suggestions.</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d he breathed, moving his hands to the small of her back so he could loosen the knot of her laces. He\u2019d wanted to do this for so long. So many nights he\u2019d lain awake dreaming of it\u2014first on the rocky ground, then on the stony plinth, at last on the wood-planked floor. Every night, he\u2019d tried to ignore the uncomfortable surface beneath his weary bones by filling his mind with thoughts of her. The gentle curves of her body, the exquisite softness of her skin.</p> <p>And here she stood before him, half bared and fully willing, and he couldn\u2019t work the damn knot. It wasn\u2019t the tightness of the tapes or the limitations of his mangled hands. He was nervous as hell. Unable to make his fingers work, yet impatient to taste her, he bent his head and kissed the side of her throat.</p><p>She gasped, letting her head roll to the side.</p><p>Taking what she offered, he kissed his way up the elongated slope of her neck. Licking and nibbling at her delicate skin, suckling the tiny pearl of her unadorned earlobe.</p><p>\u201cOh, Rhys,\u201d she sighed, tilting her head back.</p><p>The way she moaned for him ... it made his blood catch fire.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she said, craning her neck a bit more. \u201cJust look at the scrollwork on that ceiling.\u201d</p><p>He froze. That was it. She\u2019d just found the cure for his nerves.</p><p>\u201cTo hell with the damned ceiling,\u201d he growled, tugging angrily at the ends of her laces.</p><p>She gave a sharp intake of breath as he momentarily cinched them tight. The knot gave way to him this time, and the stays fell away from her body.</p><p>\u201cTo the devil with tiles and drapes,\u201d he said, whirling her to face him. He pulled down the neckline of her chemise, ripping it just a little in his effort to expose her breasts.</p><p>She swallowed hard, then gasped. Her eyes went wide as she took in the sight of her ruined shift and exposed bosom. Then the sight of him, naked and aroused.</p> <p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he told her, snaking his hand inside her chemise to palm her breast. He squeezed. \u201cClose your eyes. Stop examining everything. Just feel.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed.</p><p>He fumbled open the closures of her skirt and pulled it down over her hips. Then he divested her of her petticoats. Garters and stockings too\u2014taking caution and pleasure in rolling the flannel sheaths down her slender, shapely legs.</p><p>Then she stood before him in only her chemise, her eyes still closed. He left her for a moment. Tracing a slow circle around the room, he extinguished all but a few candles.</p><p>There, much better.</p><p>\u201cRhys?\u201d Her long, dark lashes trembled against her cheeks. \u201cMay I open my eyes now? I promise not to speak of tiles or ceilings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d With a swift yank, he widened the rent in her chemise until he could draw it over her shoulders and pull it downwards, all the way to the floor.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s two shifts you\u2019ve ruined now,\u201d she joked, curling into herself to hide her nakedness.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a dozen more tomorrow, but for tonight ...\u201d He gently pulled her arms away from her body. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn to admire the most beautiful, exquisitely crafted thing in this suite.\u201d</p><p>And he did. He brushed a fall of dark hair away from her breast, pushing it behind her shoulder so it wouldn\u2019t obscure his view. And then he stood back a pace and took a long, unhurried look at her body, from her elegantly turned toes to the arrow-straight part of her dark, shining hair. Tongues of candlelight licked over her pale skin. Her slender arms hung straight at her sides, bracketing the sensuous curves of her breasts and hips. As he watched, the rosy points of her nipples gathered to tight nubs. Between her thighs, a triangle of dark curls and shadow guarded her sex.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen a woman so beautiful in his life. And that wasn\u2019t an exaggeration. Rhys simply hadn\u2019t seen all that many unclothed women, and most of those he had seen, he\u2019d purposely tried not to examine too closely. Even so, he\u2019d wager that women of Meredith\u2019s loveliness were rare indeed.</p><p>Hell, even if they numbered in the thousands\u2014she was the only one for him.</p><p>As he stared, his already-stiff cock hardened further. Until it literally pained him to look at her. Fortunately, life had gifted him with a formidable tolerance for pain.</p><p>\u201cRhys, please,\u201d she said, twisting with impatience. \u201cThe water will have gone stone-cold.\u201d</p><p>He could only hope. A stone-cold bath was what he needed right now, if he was to keep from spilling his seed all over the floor.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Gently, he took her by the hand. \u201cCome, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m opening my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He helped her into the deep copper tub, testing the water first with his hand. It had gone a bit cool, but the tepid temperature felt good, considering the warmth of the evening.</p><p>He stood behind her as she eased into the bathing tub.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you joining me?\u201d she asked, quickly sinking up to her neck in the lukewarm water.</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d he said, crouching beside the tub and handing her a sponge. \u201cIt\u2019s not big enough for two.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth quirked. \u201cIt is, if we sit close together. I thought that was the idea. We were going to make this fast.\u201d</p><p>Rhys worried it would all be over before it started.</p><p>She put a hand to his cheek and pressed a sweet kiss to his lips. \u201cPlease. I want to bathe with you.\u201d</p><p>A little groan escaped him. How could he refuse? Rising to his feet, he swung one mighty leg over the curved copper lip of the bathtub and plunged it into the cooling water. A wave surged from the spot, splashing water onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cNever mind it,\u201d she said.</p><p>So he managed to swing his other leg in, with the effect that he straddled her legs, and his rampant arousal bobbed right above her face. It didn\u2019t seem to trouble her any, but just to be safe, he lowered himself into the water without delay, sending another, larger wave of water splashing out.</p><p>\u201cRhys, do you forget I\u2019m a widow? It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve never seen a man unclothed before.\u201d She reached for the soap and sponge, rubbing them together to form a thick, sweet-scented lather. \u201cAlthough I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say you\u2019re by far the most pleasing man I\u2019ve ever beheld.\u201d</p><p>She ran the sponge down the slope of his shin. He jerked with surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Are you ticklish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied curtly, as if she\u2019d accused him of something dastardly and weak.</p><p>She soaped his leg again, and once again his knee jerked.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI think you are ticklish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I am,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you are?\u201d Reclining against the neck rest, she raised the sponge to her own arm and lathered it from shoulder to wrist. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose ...\u201d His voice trailed off as she tilted her head and soaped her neck. He stared, entranced, as a rivulet of foam trickled down between her breasts. Beneath the surface of the water, his erection throbbed. \u201cI suppose I never had the occasion to find out.\u201d</p><p>Her hand froze, trapping the sponge against her chest. \u201cYou never had the occasion to find out? I find that hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve never bathed with a woman before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but surely you needn\u2019t bathe with a woman to\u2014\u201d She sat up abruptly, causing a little splash of her own. \u201cYou said it\u2019s been a long time for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He drew out the word.</p><p>\u201cYears, you said.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>Rhys had to think about it. \u201cEleven? That sounds about right.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cEleven years. You haven\u2019t made love to a woman in eleven years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever \u2018made love\u2019 to a woman, precisely. But I tupped a fair number when I was a youth. Whores, mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly,\u201d she echoed, beginning to soap her other arm. She seemed too distracted now to make a true performance of it, but that didn\u2019t keep Rhys from enjoying the show.</p><p>\u201cAye, mostly.\u201d He hoped his honesty didn\u2019t offend her, but he didn\u2019t see any way around it. This was his wife-to-be. If she asked him a question, he would tell her the truth.</p><p>About most things.</p><p>He cleared his throat and continued, \u201cMy first was a local girl, at Eton. She was curious, and I was ... sixteen. But the experience was so damned horrid for us both, I kept to whores after that. No more virgins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how did \u2018no more virgins\u2019 become \u2018no more women\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Dipping his head, he scooped water in his cupped hands and sloshed it over his face and neck. When he surfaced, he shook himself and said, \u201cI joined the army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I\u2019d formed the impression that even soldiers can find time for women. You know, at least an hour or two here and there, over the course of a decade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He suddenly realized that he might be making himself sound rather pitiful. Or worse, less than virile. He hastened to add, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I stopped wanting women. Don\u2019t misunderstand. But I spent most of those years fighting or recovering from injuries, so my options were limited by circumstance. And more than that ... I guess I just decided I\u2019d rather not lie with women who didn\u2019t truly want me.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cWhat woman in her right mind wouldn\u2019t want you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, uncertain how to explain it to her. To be sure, he\u2019d had offers. Made by all the wrong women, for all the wrong reasons. Soldiers\u2019 widows looking for a warm tent and strong protector. Married ladies of the ton who wanted to be tupped by a big, strapping, scary-looking brute, but who were just snobbish enough to eschew the footmen. Whores who couldn\u2019t afford to be choosy.</p><p>He thought of Leo Chatwick, who could pick up a harlot in Covent Garden and have her half in love with him before the hour was out. Perhaps if Rhys possessed that sort of talent, he could have stomached paying for sexual pleasure. But the harlots seldom came to him willingly, and even when they did, they didn\u2019t care to linger.</p><p>\u201cOnce I\u2019d gone that long without bedding any women, it seemed worth waiting to bed the right woman.\u201d Just in case it needed saying, he added, \u201cThat\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her face softened, set aglow with candlelight. \u201cRhys, that\u2019s terribly sweet.\u201d</p><p>Sweet? Well, he supposed he\u2019d take sweet. It was better than pitiful.</p><p>She lifted one of her legs from the water and propped it atop his bent knee. Despite the cool temperature of the bath, he could have sworn drops of water sizzled between them.</p><p>When she leaned forward to soap her ankle, he took the sponge from her hand. \u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d</p><p>Taking time to enjoy it, he dragged lather over every inch of her soft, supple calf and thigh. When he\u2019d finished the first leg, she lowered it back beneath the water and lifted the other for his attention. As he stroked her, she hummed low in her throat.</p><p>Emboldened, he slid the sponge up her inner thigh. She caught his wrist and pulled his hand higher. Over the smooth slope of her belly, all the way up to her breasts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWash them, too,\u201d she urged.</p><p>He obeyed, stricken mute with lust as he swirled white foam over each milky breast and pale pink tip. He teased her nipples to peaks with the rough sponge, then ran soap along the vulnerable, hidden curve beneath each breast.</p><p>Then, casting the sponge aside, he cupped her breasts in his bare hands. His fingers slicked over her soapy skin, and he clamped his thumbs tight over her puckered nipples to anchor them. She moaned her approval as he stroked and kneaded, but when he slid his fingers down toward her sex, she stayed his hand.</p> <p>Hell. He\u2019d done something wrong. Gotten too greedy. She didn\u2019t want him to\u2014</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d she said, her lips curving in a seductive smile. She reached for the sponge and soap.</p><p>His turn? Was she serious? He was about to spill in the bathwater, just from washing her. He didn\u2019t think he could tolerate being on the receiving end of such ministrations.</p><p>But apparently she didn\u2019t mean to ask his permission.</p><p>Puffs of scented white foam bloomed as she squeezed the sponge. She began with his arms, washing each from wrist to shoulder. The jasmine fragrance calmed his nerves. Sensations rippled and slid over his skin. God, it felt so ... so good. There was no other word for it. Just pure, simple, straightforward good. Damn good. She had him so relaxed, he thought he would dissolve into the bathwater.</p> <p>Until, stretching forward, she swabbed him under the arm. He flinched and bolted upright.</p><p>\u201cI knew it. You are ticklish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I am.\u201d</p><p>Looking pleased with herself, she kept right on working, lathering his chest, neck, shoulders, legs. And he loved every moment of it, even when she teased the bottom of his foot and he convulsed with shock and laughter, and they lost half the bathwater onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Grasping her waist with both hands, he pulled her to him. Her legs bent and doubled, forming a wall between his chest and hers. He wrapped his own big legs around her, planting his heels at the base of her spine. And then he kissed her, long and hard and deep. Tasting each of her lips in turn and exploring her mouth with his tongue. She tasted of wine and spice, and just faintly of soap. Both intoxicating and innocent. He went dizzy with the knowledge that tonight he needn\u2019t hold anything back.</p><p>Grasping his shoulders, she pulled up and repositioned herself until she knelt between his legs. He kissed her again, and oh, God. Now her firm, soapy breasts pressed to his chest, slipping and rubbing against his scarred flesh.</p> <p>She wriggled one hand between them, and Rhys felt her slender fingers close over his erection. Pleasure jolted through him as she gently stroked. Up, then down.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he said hoarsely, tearing his lips from hers. \u201cStop. It\u2019s been eleven years. If you keep that up, I won\u2019t last eleven seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, pressing little kisses to his mouth and jaw. \u201cI know. It\u2019s all right. Let me do this for you first, and then we can take our time.\u201d She sat back on her heels, still stroking him. \u201cLet me touch you, Rhys. I\u2019ve been wanting to touch you. You feel so good.\u201d</p><p>He groaned as her fingers explored his full length, tracing each vein and ridge, skimming over the swollen, sensitive crown. Rhys dug deep down inside himself, fairly down to the beds of his toenails, searching for the willpower to grab her hand and make her stop. It was a fruitless search.</p><p>\u201cMerry ...\u201d Damn it, he thought he\u2019d finished with these one-sided sexual encounters, where all the enjoyment was on his end. \u201cI want to pleasure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you will.\u201d Her eyes danced with ripples of silver. Her fist tightened around him, and she began to pump faster. \u201cBelieve me. This is for my pleasure as much as it is for yours.\u201d</p><p>He doubted that. As her hand sweetly massaged, he couldn\u2019t even put words to the sensations coursing through his body. No, no words. Just hoarse sighs and ragged moans. She worked him in a steady rhythm, and he reveled in the newness of it. All the ways it felt different from when he pleasured himself. Her hand was smaller and so much softer than his own. Her grip wasn\u2019t as tight, and her pace was slower than he would have set. Still, he fought the instinct to thrust his hips or urge her faster. Instead he closed his eyes and forced himself to be patient, to submit to her rhythm and the bliss mounting by steady, slow degrees.</p><p>Another small surrender, so torturous and yet so sweet.</p> <p>\u201cGod.\u201d He gripped the sides of the tub, and every muscle in his body went rigid with the effort of restraint. \u201cYou have to stop,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. \u201cYou have to stop now, or I can\u2019t ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. Just let it happen.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have a choice anymore. Free will had ceased to exist. The crisis building in his loins was as inescapable as destiny itself, and twice as powerful.</p><p>With one last snarling growl, he let the climax take him. His hips bucked off the tub\u2019s copper base, and he jerked into her tight fist, spurting jet after jet into the tepid water.</p><p>When the waves of pleasure subsided, he stared unfocused at the ceiling as he tried to catch his breath. All the while, she kept caressing and stroking him, smoothing those talented fingers over his spent body. He couldn\u2019t believe the small miracle of it: that she not only wanted to touch him, she would keep doing so willingly, after the deed was finished.</p><p>And he felt the same about her. He wasn\u2019t filled with self-loathing and a sudden, irresistible urge to yank on his clothes, toss a coin on the table, fling himself on a horse and ride away so hard, so fast, he just might finally outrun himself. No, he wanted to stay right here, and a team of draft horses couldn\u2019t have dragged him away. He would touch and caress and kiss and stroke and lick and pleasure her all night long. Just as soon as some strength returned to his limbs.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d he said moments later, still blinking up at the ceiling. \u201cThat is remarkably fine scrollwork.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and leaned forward to kiss his cheek.</p><p>He sat up with sudden purpose. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of this bath.\u201d</p><p>Beside the tub were two pitchers of clean water for rinsing. He stood up and raised one over his head, quickly dousing himself clean, then shaking like a wet dog.</p><p>\u201cRhys!\u201d she squeaked, holding her hands up as a shield.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re already wet.\u201d He stepped out of the tub and directed her to stand in the center. Hefting the second pitcher in one hand, he told her, \u201cNow turn your back to me, hold up your hair, and be still.\u201d</p><p>She did as he asked, and he rinsed her slowly, allowing just a trickle of water to escape the pitcher as he moved it over her shoulders and neck. When the water cascaded down the elegant curve of her spine, she shivered and laughed. He poured water over the taut, pale globes of her backside, watching gooseflesh ripple over her skin.</p><p>\u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she turned to face him. He dashed water over her collarbones. Then, with great concentration, he applied a small trickle to each of her breasts in turn. Carefully aiming the stream, he poured water directly over her nipple. Between the chill of the bath and this new stimulation, the round nub puckered tighter than ever. Which was, of course, exactly his hoped-for result.</p><p>Still holding the half-empty pitcher at his side, Rhys bent his head and sucked that lovely pink nipple into his mouth. She jolted with surprise, but he slid his free arm around her waist to steady her.</p><p>Damn, but he\u2019d been waiting to do this forever. And thanks to her selfless efforts in the bath, now he could take all the time he pleased. Alternating between her breasts, he sucked and licked those delectable buds, pressing his face close to breathe in the fresh, clean scent of her skin.</p><p>Curling her fingers around his shoulders, she released a low, breathy moan. And though he\u2019d just experienced a devastating climax not five minutes ago, Rhys felt his loins beginning to stir again.</p><p>Reluctantly, he pulled away from her breasts. Her nipples were darker and harder than ever. They looked like a pair of tightly furled rosebuds, glistening with dew. He moved the pitcher over her belly and poured a stream of water straight over her navel. The water quickly overflowed the small depression, channeling down to her pelvis and between her legs.</p><p>She gasped and stiffened. Her fingernails bit into his shoulders.</p><p>Evidently she\u2019d liked that.</p><p>With measured caution, he pressed the pitcher\u2019s curved lip to the top of her mound, just above the triangle of dark curls that concealed her sex. Little by little, he tilted the pitcher forward, until a trickle of water came forth, coursing straight over her intimate flesh.</p><p>This time, she cried out.</p><p>He tilted the pitcher a bit more, increasing the flow of water. Her hips tilted and she spread her legs, until the tiny stream ran between the folds of her sex. Her throaty sounds of delight echoed off the tiles.</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d he asked. He knew the answer, but he wanted to hear her say it. Over and over, not just once.</p><p>\u201cIt feels so ...\u201d\u2014she gasped as he tilted the pitcher farther still\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t even describe it.\u201d</p><p>His chest swelled with a primitive, male sort of pride. \u201cI\u2019m out of water,\u201d he said, crouching to set the pitcher aside.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her whimper of disappointment was brief. \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s best. I\u2019m getting cold. I think there are towels in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>He knelt before her, pressing his mouth to her core.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Meredith shrieked. And very nearly fell on her arse. It was a fortunate thing she already had her fingernails hooked into his shoulders like talons. Still, he had to clutch her waist with both hands to keep her from losing her balance completely.</p><p>Once he had her steadied, he reapplied himself to his task, caressing her most intimate flesh with his tongue. Gently ... so gently, his attentions felt just like the water had. Warm, subtle, unrelenting in their tenderness.</p><p>His hands left her waist, sliding down to her sex. Using his thumbs, he carefully parted and spread her feminine folds.</p><p>\u201cRhys.\u201d Her voice tweaked. \u201cI\u2019ve never ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush. Neither have I.\u201d The words sent huffs of delicious warmth rushing over her skin. \u201cSo neither of us will know if I\u2019m doing it wrong.\u201d</p><p>He swirled his tongue over the swollen bud of nerves at the crest of her sex, and Meredith nearly lost her footing again.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said between gasps, \u201cI\u2019m quite certain you\u2019re doing it right.\u201d</p><p>No more joking now. He went silent with concentration, exploring her thoroughly with his lips and tongue. Meredith moaned and sighed. She\u2019d never felt pleasure this acute, so intense her bones threatened to melt with it. And it was so, so right that he would be the one to give her this feeling. He\u2019d always been the one man to spark fiery sensations in her, even when she\u2019d been barely more than a girl.</p><p>Patiently, with tender care, he worked her closer and closer to release. The muscles in her thighs began to tremble, and the copper tub seemed to undulate beneath her feet.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI ...\u201d His tongue flickered over her, and for a moment she lost the power of speech. \u201cRhys, I don\u2019t know how much longer I can stand.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, simply hooked one arm under her thigh, until her leg rested on his shoulder. Then he framed her waist tightly between his arms, supporting her weight.</p><p>In this pose, with one leg planted in the inch of remaining bathwater and the other leg thrown over her lover\u2019s shoulder ... Meredith felt a bit like a stork. She also felt very much on display. This posture revealed her most intimate places, spreading them wide to his examination and view. He pulled back for a moment, and she could feel him looking at her. Anticipation swirled in her blood, centering between her legs in a rapid, needy pulse.</p><p>After what must have been merely a moment but felt like an eternity, his open mouth covered her sex, and he circled his tongue, and everything exploded into pure, bright pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He held her tight as she came, never letting her weaken or fall, and all the while he kept up the slow, gentle swipes of his tongue, bringing her wave after wave of bliss.</p><p>Later, she scarcely remembered how they made it to the bed. He must have carried her, seeing as how her limbs had ceased to function. She recalled snuggling into a plush towel as she hit the mattress, and the way the heat of his body cocooned her shortly thereafter. They must have slept that way for a while. It was sheer joy just to lie next to him at last, nestled into his broad chest and pinned by the weight of one brawny forearm.</p><p>So much pleasure, and still they\u2019d hardly begun.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t clear whether he woke her, or she woke him, but Meredith came to consciousness through a thick, cottony fog. Her limbs were so entwined with Rhys\u2019s, she had a tricky time of it, sorting out which strands of the knot belonged to her and which to him. She supposed it didn\u2019t really matter.</p><p>As her eyes fluttered open, his lips covered hers. Oh, how lovely, to be kissed awake. She closed her eyes again, wanting to prolong the drowsy haze. He began slowly, brushing light kisses over her mouth, cheeks, temple, and brow. The softness of his kiss was in delicious contrast to the hardness of his male organ, which pressed insistently against her thigh.</p><p>Wriggling in his embrace, Meredith reclaimed the use of her arms. She kissed him back\u2014first lightly, then deep\u2014and as they kissed, she ran her fingers over every inch of him she could reach. Through his short hair, over the nape of his neck, down the sculpted planes of his shoulders and back. A low moan rumbled through his chest when she flicked a thumbnail over his nipple. Encouraged, she did it again.</p><p>How could a man live to the age of one-and-thirty without knowing he was ticklish? To think that no nursemaid, no friend, no lover\u2014for God\u2019s sake, no parent\u2014had ever touched him in a playful manner. To know that he\u2019d lived with constant physical violence and not the slightest scrap of physical affection ... Her heart broke for him all over again, just as it had when she was a girl.</p><p>But she was a woman now, and determined to make up for lost time. Before they left this bed, she would touch him everywhere. Tenderly, desirously. With not only fingers, but lips and tongue, too. He was uncharted ground\u2014practically virgin territory, she thought dryly to herself. But not after tonight. She meant to explore every inch of his body, noting every spot that elicited a laugh, a sigh, or a moan.</p> <p>And somehow, by the grace of God, she would make him understand that he deserved this. He deserved to be kissed, stroked, pleasured, held.</p><p>He deserved to be loved.</p><p>Fully awake now, they lay side by side, facing one another. Meredith propped her head on one elbow and reached her other hand between them. It didn\u2019t take long to find what she was seeking. It was a big enough target, after all. Not exactly the proverbial needle in a haystack. She\u2019d been delighted to learn that her memories of his body hadn\u2019t been some combination of time\u2019s distortion and her youthful inexperience. Over the years, she\u2019d compared every man in her life to her memories of Rhys. Here was just one more way those other men had come up lacking.</p><p>She stroked him slowly, watching his eyes flutter with pleasure beneath closed lids.</p><p>\u201cGod, that feels good,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou sound so surprised,\u201d she teased. Gentling her tone, she asked, \u201cWas it really so bad before?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe first time? Hell, yes.\u201d He opened his eyes. Brushing a strand of hair behind her ear, he said, \u201cWorse for her than for me. Poor girl screamed like she was being murdered. We didn\u2019t even finish. Everything about it was just ... wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure she wasn\u2019t enjoying herself?\u201d Meredith smiled. \u201cMaybe she was just the screaming sort. Some women are.\u201d</p><p>His brow creased. \u201cAre you the screaming sort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly, inwardly resolving not to make so much as a peep. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how would you know some women are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI own an inn, Rhys. The walls aren\u2019t very thick.\u201d</p><p>She slid her hand further down, reaching to cradle his heavy sac in her hand and delighting in his low groan of pleasure. He clasped her hip and pulled her against him, grinding his thick shaft against her belly. She threw a leg over his narrow hips, opening herself to him. A clear invitation.</p><p>Still he hesitated.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she assured him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a virgin or a screamer. Everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be better than fine.\u201d His hand ranged over her hip, and he reached down to stroke her cleft, probing with his fingers to test her readiness and groaning with satisfaction when he found her quite ready indeed. He slid his thumb to her pearl and gently massaged. \u201cThis has to be so damn unbelievably good that you want to do it again, and again, every day for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery day?\u201d she teased. \u201cSuch stamina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be making up for a lot of lost time.\u201d Pausing, he gave the appearance of serious consideration. \u201cEvery day for the next decade, at least. After that, it will depend on the state of my joints.\u201d</p><p>She threw back her head and laughed.</p><p>When he began to kiss the hollow of her neck, Meredith decided this was the time. She grasped his erection firmly and guided it to the damp, needy ache between her legs.</p><p>She stretched; he nudged.</p><p>And then he was inside her, just an inch. They drew a shaky breath together.</p><p>Now an inch more.</p><p>She bit her lip to keep from moaning. Truth be told, he was big, and she was very out of practice, had never given birth. She was probably as tight as a widow could be. It hurt, but deliciously so.</p><p>They stared into one another\u2019s eyes as he fed her another inch of his length, then two.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded, breathless. \u201cGive me just a moment? Just like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d He gritted his teeth through a few beats of her pulse. \u201cGod, I can\u2019t wait, I ... I need more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>A gasp took the rest of her willing reply, as he clutched her hip and thrust.</p><p>Meredith buried her face in his shoulder. I will not scream. I will not scream.</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she squeaked through clenched teeth.</p><p>After a moment\u2019s rest, she dragged in a deep breath, then released it slowly. He rocked against her, in the gentlest of thrusts. Their natural moisture spread, easing the way. When he thrust again, she could tell he slid deeper than he\u2019d intended. A groan rumbled from his chest, loosening her tense muscles.</p><p>And then, suddenly, it wasn\u2019t painful anymore. It was very, very good.</p><p>She worked against him, struggling to take him deeper, desperate for more. More heat, more friction. The firm slide of him against her taut, sensitive flesh.</p><p>She lifted her head and opened her eyes so she could watch his expression as they established a rhythm. Slow. Steady. Devastating. With each thrust, he sank a bit deeper, stretched her body a bit wider, prodded her one step closer to the brink of ecstasy.</p><p>His face was a mask of concentration\u2014eyes intent, brow furrowed, lower lip folded under his teeth. He seemed to be gauging her reactions just as carefully as she was watching for his.</p><p>\u201cIs it good?\u201d she asked, breathless.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes. You feel so ...\u201d He grit his teeth as her intimate muscles squeezed in response. \u201c... so much better than my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hands feel good to me.\u201d</p><p>Laying a hand over his, she dragged his touch from her hip to her breast. He cupped the small globe easily in his palm, kneading gently. Pleasure spread through her body as he chafed his thumb over her hardened nipple. A lusty sigh eased from her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou like that.\u201d He thumbed her nipple again.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She tightened her leg over his hips and flexed her thigh, drawing him deeper into her.</p><p>Relaxing her neck, she rested her head on her arm and simply stared into his beautiful eyes as together they worked their hips back and forth. In and out. \u201cThis is wonderful, Rhys. I\u2019m so glad we\u2019re doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I. Believe me. Another week of holding back, and I think I would have imploded.\u201d One eyebrow arched. \u201cIs it strange that we\u2019re talking so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange? Perhaps it\u2019s not usual, but it doesn\u2019t feel strange in the least, not to me. It feels ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d His breath hitched as he rocked his hips and sank deeper than ever. \u201cIt just feels right.\u201d Another thrust. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord. It did. Of course it did.</p><p>His eyes drilled into hers, demanding and intense. Even with his arousal wedged against her womb, she felt more deeply penetrated by his gaze. There was desire there, and need ... and just the faintest glimmer of fear. He gave another powerful buck of his hips. \u201cAdmit it. This is right, you and me. Meant to be.\u201d</p><p>A voice within her shouted for caution, urged her to put up a wall of defense. Don\u2019t, the voice said. You\u2019ll reveal too much, risk heartbreak and worse.</p><p>Go to the devil, she told it back.</p><p>Rhys was inside her, and next to her, and surrounding her with his embrace, and he needed so damn much. The man had suffered a lifetime deprived of affection, and he clung to all this destiny nonsense because\u2014uncertain, wounded soul that he was\u2014he couldn\u2019t bring himself to ask for hers. This was why he\u2019d never offered her a choice. He was too afraid she\u2019d say no.</p><p>She would not force him to ask. Not when she longed to give him everything. Affection, pleasure, a gentle lover\u2019s touch.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed, curling her arm around his shoulders. Stretching her neck, she brushed a kiss against his lips. \u201cYes, Rhys. It feels right.\u201d She kissed those strong, sensuous lips again, then again, running her fingers through his feathery hair as she did. \u201cUtterly ... perfectly ... absolutely right. We belong like this.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her thoroughly, taking her mouth with feverish, driven passion. With a low groan, he rolled her onto her back and sank in deep.</p><p>Very deep. So deep, she gripped his shoulders in shock. In their side-by-side position, he obviously hadn\u2019t penetrated her fully. No, there was definitely more of Rhys to be had. And now he gave it all to her, thrusting hard, working deeper, until his hips met against hers and the breath left her lungs.</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d he asked, bracing himself on his elbows.</p><p>She managed a nod.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Thrust. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t stop.\u201d Thrust. \u201cGod help me, I can\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He thrust again, and his pelvis ground against hers. And she came, just like that. The feel of his strong body, the ragged need in his voice, all the emotion in her heart\u2014she was overwhelmed, in every sense. The pleasure swept her in a hot, unrelenting rush, and she clung to him, riding it for all it was worth.</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d The tight growl of his voice told her he was close, too. \u201cGod.\u201d He fell on her, lowering his weight to hers. \u201cHold on,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cHold me tight.\u201d</p><p>She did as he asked, as she wanted to do. Locked her arms around his neck and wrapped her legs over the tree trunks that were his thighs. She cinched her intimate muscles, holding him tight there, too.</p><p>And then, when she\u2019d gripped him in every way imaginable\u2014he let go. The force and tempo of his thrusts increased. His mouth fell on hers, and he probed wildly with his tongue as he took her faster, harder, deeper. As though there were something he desperately needed, something that resided at the very center of her being\u2014and to get at it, he would break her apart.</p><p>Tearing his mouth from hers, he reared up a bit. Just enough that she could see his face. His eyes were unfocused, and his lips contorted with pleasure. And as the inevitable approached, an incoherent rush of words tore from his chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s so ... Damn, it\u2019s ... Merry ... Christ.\u201d</p><p>Joy swelled in her breast, and she nearly laughed with it. Because she knew the next thirty seconds were going to be the best of Rhys St. Maur\u2019s decade, and she was just so happy to be there, along for the ride.</p><p>He growled as he came, collapsing onto her and burying his face in her neck. She released her grip on his shoulders and soothed his back with caresses down his spine. Her fingers slipped over the sheen of perspiration as he shuddered in the aftermath of his release.</p> <p>Eventually, she felt his breathing slow to a natural rhythm, washing gently over her ear. His arousal softened inside her. And yet the tremors in his muscles didn\u2019t abate.</p><p>\u201cOh, Rhys.\u201d As the realization dawned, she hugged him tight. \u201cOh, Rhys.\u201d</p><p>He was trembling. This big, strong, indestructible warrior was trembling in her arms. If there\u2019d been any hope of protecting her heart, it slipped away that instant.</p><p>She was lost to him. Always had been.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he murmured, releasing a deep sigh of satisfaction.</p> <p>She cradled his head, kissed his ear.</p><p>\u201cWas it\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she assured him. \u201cIn every way.\u201d He rolled to the side, and she teased a fingertip along the whiskered edge of his jaw. Arching an eyebrow saucily, she asked, \u201cSo ... every day? Truly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice. For the first year, twice a day. At least.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and gave him a pensive look.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, reaching out to playfully muss her hair.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just wondering whether that includes today. And if so ...\u201d She rose up on her elbow and peered at the clock. \u201cHow much time is left before midnight?\u201d</p><p>The bed shook with his laughter. His arm shot out, flattening her to the mattress. With a flex of his biceps, he rolled her in close, nestling her snug against him. \u201cTime enough, Merry. Don\u2019t you worry.\u201d His big hand stroked through her hair. \u201cWe have all the time in the world.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, she wished blind faith came so easily to her.</p><p>With a sudden burst of energy, she climbed atop him, stretching her body out over his. With her arms stacked on his chest, her toes hit him just about mid-shin. The hair on his legs tickled the arches of her feet. \u201cI\u2019ve just realized something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent a shockingly inadequate amount of time tasting the area between here\u201d\u2014she stroked a finger over his Adam\u2019s apple\u2014\u201cand here.\u201d She traced a line to the soft spot just below his ear. \u201cUnless you have a complaint, I plan to remedy that immediately.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNo complaint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d She bent her head to his throat and touched her tongue to the underside of his jaw. The beginning of what would be, if she had her way, a sleepless night spent exploring every inch of his body.</p> <p>They might not have all the time in the world, but they definitely had tonight. And she was going to make the most of every second.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Awareness filtered in some time well after dawn. When she woke to bright sunlight leaking through her eyelashes, Meredith kissed the forearm wrapped protectively about her chest. It was worth the lost time, just to wake up in his arms. She couldn\u2019t even remember the last time she\u2019d slept through a sunrise. This was a luxury indeed. One to which she could too easily become accustomed. Rhys stirred, nuzzling her hair. They lay on their sides, nestled like spoons in a drawer. At least one part of him was awake and ready to greet the day. The hard ridge of his arousal prodded her hip.</p><p>She wriggled her bottom just a little, teasing him. From the way his breath caught in his throat, she suspected he was awake. For all she knew, he might have been lying awake that way for hours, hard and patiently aching for her.</p><p>And in that case, he could wait a few minutes more. Keeping her eyes shut tight to feign sleep, she casually stretched and nestled deeper into the hard contours of his body. He dropped a kiss against the back of her neck, as if to test her wakefulness. Remaining immobile was a struggle, but she managed it. His hand came to life where it lay draped casually over her breast. He drew a lazy circle around her nipple, then tweaked it with a pinch. She couldn\u2019t help but moan.</p><p>He knew she was awake. She knew he was, too. But they kept up the little game they were playing. Somehow they\u2019d tacitly agreed on the rules. Eyes closed. No words. Just touch and a steady, inexorable progress toward joining. It was a game they would both win.</p><p>She parted her legs a few degrees, and his erection slid between her thighs. The two of them lay that way for a moment, savoring that last bit of anticipation. She was wet for him, and he was impressively hard. A little tilt of her pelvis was all it took. He glided into her slippery cleft in one smooth thrust.</p><p>Though her breathing came fast, Meredith forced herself to be boneless. As passive as possible. She hoped the mounting tension of their game would drive him past the point of tenderness. All night long, they\u2019d guided one another through an exploration of different positions, taken thorough tours of each other\u2019s anatomy. He\u2019d loved her with a sweet, earnest purpose that touched her heart. But this morning, she wanted him to be the aggressor. She needed to feel all the strength and power in that big, hard body. She wanted to be overwhelmed.</p><p>When the wait became unbearable, she broke the rules and whispered, \u201cTake me.\u201d</p><p>His teeth scraped her shoulder. With a low growl, he flipped her onto her stomach, wedging her legs apart with his thighs. He gave her just what she wanted, driving into her hard. So hard, she grabbed the pillow to muffle her cry. The bed creaked and rattled with each stroke.</p><p>Yes. Yes. This was exactly what she craved. To feel powerless beneath him, utterly at his mercy. She\u2019d spent so much of her life being strong. Marshalling all her available fortitude to run the inn, take care of her father, look after the village. And she\u2019d built up formidable shields to protect herself and those around her. It was a relief and a joy to be dominated, to relinquish all power and feel those barriers stripped away by someone she knew and trusted.</p><p>Someone she loved.</p><p>He rose up between her legs, grasping her hips in his massive hands and lifting her to her knees. His fingers curled around the cheeks of her backside, guiding her motions, spreading her open for his deepening thrusts. By the light smack of his thighs kissing hers and the roughened quality of his breath, she suspected he was watching their joined bodies. She wished she could watch, too.</p><p>He clutched her hips tighter still, kicked into a faster rhythm. \u201cCome for me. Do it now.\u201d</p><p>Releasing the pillow, she slid one hand down her belly, between her legs. She pressed the heel of her hand against her mound and curled her fingers back, so they teased his shaft with every stroke. The pressure of her palm just where she needed it, the very proof of his own need, hard and hot against her fingertips\u2014she hurtled headlong into a soul-shaking climax, crying out against the pillow.</p><p>He followed her seconds later, and together they collapsed to the mattress. He lay half atop her, half to the side. His breath was a rasp against her ear. She loved the heat and the weight of him, pinning her limp, wrung-out body to the bed. She could get used to this. She really could.</p><p>For the first time since Rhys had mentioned marriage over boiled eggs and coffee, Meredith let herself believe, just for a moment, that it might truly be safe to get used to this.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said after a minute or two, rolling onto his back, \u201cI think I\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d She propped her chin on one arm, tried to sound nonchalant. All the while, her heart was hammering the mattress.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to find a bishop,\u201d he said. \u201cGet a special license. There\u2019s no bloody way we\u2019re waiting another fortnight for that curate to come back.\u201d</p><p>She collapsed to the bed with relief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take the coach and set off for London today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys, we can\u2019t do that. Father\u2019s expecting me back on schedule. And we\u2019ve all those things to buy for the inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor our house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. That, too.\u201d</p><p>His brow creased. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why can\u2019t we\u2014\u201d</p><p>She kissed him, for no other reason than to cut short that question.</p><p>So strange. Ten minutes ago all she\u2019d craved was for Rhys to take control, to leave her no choice, to overwhelm her senses completely. And never during their lovemaking had she felt anything other than cherished and safe. But an elopement ...?</p><p>\u201cI was promised a tour of Bath,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cThere was talk of ribbons and romance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there was.\u201d He gave her a smile, and she felt its warmth deep inside.</p><p>She loved him. After last night, there was no more denying it, not even to herself. And nothing would make her happier than to marry him. There were obstacles, yes. The inn\u2019s future, Gideon\u2019s threats ... but from such a great distance, those obstacles seemed smaller now. Surmountable. Between them, surely she and Rhys had the strength and wits to sort it all out.</p><p>There was only one matter left to settle. Would marriage to her make Rhys happy? Not just satisfied in bed or at peace with his obligations, but truly happy? He deserved real contentment. With all this blind allegiance to the concept of destiny, she wasn\u2019t sure he even knew what he wanted anymore. Given the choice, would he truly prefer a cottage in rural Devonshire to the opulent life he could be leading elsewhere? Would he honestly prefer her to the elegant ladies he could have?</p><p>His words kept echoing in her mind: It\u2019s not like I have something better to do.</p><p>But he did. With his rank and wealth, he had so many options, and this holiday was likely to remind him of them. Before she could marry him, she needed time to observe, to gauge his thoughts and feelings in a setting outside their village.</p><p>\u201cI just want to spend time with you,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cWhat do the gentry do in Bath, anyhow?\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips. \u201cTruthfully, I\u2019m not so certain anymore. I only spent one summer here as a boy, when my mother came to take the waters. That\u2019s why people ostensibly come to Bath, you know. To take the mineral waters. If I recall correctly, the usual practice is to begin the day with a nice purgative, then travel by sedan chair to the Pump Room to sign the guest register and drink a glass or two of the rusty, foul-smelling stuff.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord. That was the reason wealthy people flocked to Bath? People of quality would spend their money on the queerest things. But she didn\u2019t want to offend Rhys by gainsaying the idea.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to drink the waters?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWhat do you think? No, we\u2019ll confine ourselves to the shops by day. Perhaps a walk about the Circus and Royal Crescent. And then later tonight ... should you like to go to the theater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d Inwardly she cheered. She would have a use for that red gown, after all. \u201cThat sounds like a perfectly lovely day. No purgatives or sedan chairs required.\u201d</p><p>Rhys had never been one for visiting the shops. But then, he\u2019d never had a lady on his arm to spoil. This, he learned, made the whole experience more tolerable.</p><p>They didn\u2019t make it out of the suite until well after noon, but they dealt with the practical things first. He\u2019d inquired at the hotel as to the source of the painted washbasin in their suite that had Meredith so enraptured, and they made that importer\u2019s warehouse their first stop of the afternoon. There they ordered complete sets of basins, pitchers, chamber pots, and mirrors. \u201cFour sets,\u201d Meredith told the shopkeeper.</p><p>\u201cFive,\u201d Rhys corrected.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d She frowned up at him. \u201cOh, I see. So we have a spare, should anything break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake that six sets,\u201d he called to the shopkeeper. \u201cFour for the guest rooms,\u201d he told her, \u201cone for a spare, and one for our house.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d The little furrow in her brow only deepened. \u201cBut the set for the cottage doesn\u2019t have to be so fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does.\u201d And forbidding any further discussion with a look, he gave the shopkeeper the address of their hotel. That was, after adding to the order a full set of china and silver for the Three Hounds\u2019 new dining room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to repay you somehow,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely not. This was part of the arrangement. I agreed to pay all construction expenses in return for the labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but most would not classify the washbasins and silver as construction expenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they are. How can a guest room be considered complete without a washstand? What use is a dining room without silver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she consented as they left the importer\u2019s. \u201cBut I insist on paying for the fabrics from my own purse.\u201d</p><p>Rhys shook his head as he guided her out the door. Why did she argue over these small expenses? Once they married, all their money would be combined.</p> <p>They strolled for a while, stopping in at Sally Lunn\u2019s for a bit of refreshment and a taste of the famous buns. Rhys declared them tasty enough, but vastly inferior to Meredith\u2019s own baking. That compliment earned him a toss of her dark head and a very pretty blush. All in all, he was modestly pleased with his progress in the romance arena.</p><p>Then it was on to the draper\u2019s. There Meredith took command. A mountain of fabrics amassed on the countertop as she asked for yard after yard of plain, but high quality linen for bedsheets, then printed dimity for curtains. And she insisted on paying for them from her own purse, to Rhys\u2019s frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhat about for the cottage?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s linen enough here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the curtains?\u201d He nodded toward a bolt of ivory lace. \u201cIsn\u2019t that similar to the lace you liked so much at the hotel?\u201d</p><p>She tsked. \u201cIt would be terribly impractical for curtains in the country. They\u2019d become so soiled and would easily tear.\u201d</p> <p>He tapped his finger on the counter. \u201cHow many yards would you need, to make a set? There are eight windows in all.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and gave him a number. He tripled it in his mind and asked the shopkeeper to cut that amount and start a new bill.</p><p>\u201cEnough for three sets,\u201d he told her. \u201cWhen they become soiled, we\u2019ll change them for new. And when we run out of new, it\u2019s time for another trip to Bath.\u201d To escape the disapproving set of her mouth, he traveled down the counter to a glass case filled with a blinding array of plumes, ribbons, fans, and brilliants. Almost at random, he selected an assortment of silky and sparkly things, in as many colors as they came. The shopkeeper dutifully wrapped and tallied them as Meredith settled her fabric bill.</p><p>When at last she\u2019d finished settling accounts and drifted down to stand at his elbow, Meredith\u2019s gaze wandered over the dazzling array. \u201cAre you buying souvenirs for Cora?\u201d she asked. \u201cShe\u2019ll be so happy. That lavender plume will look very well in her hair.\u201d</p><p>For Cora? With effort, Rhys swallowed a growl of frustration. Why wouldn\u2019t the woman allow him to give her a little taste of luxury? \u201cThey\u2019re not for ...\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed off as he noticed she\u2019d gone quiet, too. She stared, lips slightly parted, at a silver dresser set in the case. The set included a boar-bristle hairbrush and matching engraved hand mirror, neatly arranged on a gilt-edged tray.</p><p>Wordlessly, he directed the girl behind the counter to remove the set from the case.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d Meredith sighed, picking up the hand mirror and turning it glass-side up.</p> <p>Rhys moved to stand behind her shoulder. Catching her gaze in the reflection, he said, \u201cIt could be solid gold and encrusted with pearls, and it still wouldn\u2019t be as beautiful as the woman reflected in it. But thank God something has caught your eye.\u201d To the girl, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll take the set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys, no. It\u2019s too expensive.\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. \u201cNot for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely, but it\u2019s not really the sort of thing I\u2019d use. It would only gather dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll have a maid dust it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I can.\u201d Despite all his efforts to remain emotionless, his blood began to heat. His cravat felt glued to his throat. Lowering his voice, he muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s a hairbrush and a tray and a bloody mirror. And I\u2019m buying them for you, no matter how much you protest. So stop arguing.\u201d</p><p>She looked away, pressing her lips together into a thin line. \u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>They stood in awkward silence as the shopkeeper finished wrapping their purchases and Rhys settled the account. After arranging for most of their packages to be delivered to the hotel, he turned to Meredith and handed her the parcel containing the dresser set. She thanked him demurely, then turned for the door.</p><p>And it was all ruined, damn it. Farewell to his fantasies of dragging that silver brush through her hair, arranging it around her bare shoulders and breasts. Now every time she looked in that hand mirror, she\u2019d see an awkward moment when he\u2019d lost his temper and snapped at her in the draper\u2019s. Just one more beautiful, shining thing he\u2019d managed to tarnish.</p><p>He\u2019d make it up to her somehow. In fact, he\u2019d start right now, with an apology.</p><p>Catching up to her, he stopped her in the street. \u201cMerry, I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have pressed you to accept a gift you didn\u2019t want. We can return the dratted thing this instant, if you like.\u201d</p><p>Her hands tightened over the parcel. \u201cRhys, that\u2019s not it. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to understand. Explain it to me.\u201d He gestured uselessly with his hands, hardly knowing how to form the question. \u201cYou have no problem buying fine things for your guests. Why can\u2019t I give you fine things, too?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to accept them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifficult? You perform six difficult tasks before breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what about you? I don\u2019t see you buying any luxuries for yourself.\u201d</p><p>His chin jerked. \u201cBut that\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it is. You deserve fine things, too, you know.\u201d Her eye settled on a shop window behind him, and he could see her gaze sharpening on something in particular. \u201cI\u2019m going to go in and buy you that, right now. And if you don\u2019t want to be called an insufferable hypocrite, you\u2019re going to wait right here while I do, and when I come out, you\u2019ll not say a word about it other than \u2018thank you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He stood there, stunned, as she left him and entered the shop. Belatedly, he looked to the shop\u2019s window just in time to see a pair of hands removing a gentleman\u2019s shaving kit from the display. It was a quality set. The razor\u2019s handle and the knob of the shaving brush were both fashioned from horn, with gilt accents. He couldn\u2019t let her purchase that for him. She\u2019d be spending straight down to the lining of her purse.</p><p>But if he tried to prevent her ... she\u2019d be furious. Poverty was an easier condition to remedy than a woman\u2019s displeasure.</p><p>A minute passed, and out she came, delivering the wrapped parcel into his hand. He stood blinking at it.</p><p>Lifting her chin, she regarded him with a challenge in her eyes. \u201cAnd ...?\u201d</p><p>He forced the words out. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see? It\u2019s not so easy to say as it would seem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of practice, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith gratitude?\u201d</p><p>He cleared the emotion from his throat. \u201cWith gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d She gave him a meaningful look. Taking his arm, she said, \u201cIf it helps at all, it was mostly for me. I discovered this morning how much I love watching you shave.\u201d</p><p>He gave a shout of laughter, remembering the way she\u2019d tackled him to the bed after he\u2019d finished. God, her inner thigh had been like silk against his smooth-shaven cheek. His trousers pulled snug, just at the memory. That was it. Shopping be damned. He couldn\u2019t get inside her soon enough.</p><p>Without hesitation, he guided her into a hairpin turn and set a course back to the hotel. \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough of the shops for today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhem.\u201d</p><p>Several pleasant hours later, Meredith cleared her throat as she emerged from the dressing room. One of the hotel\u2019s girls had helped her dress in the red silk gown and assisted her with a sleek upswept coiffure. Now she was anxious to see Rhys\u2019s reaction. He stood before the wardrobe, peering into the small mirror hung inside the door as he tied his cravat. When he took no notice of her gentle clearings of the throat, she coughed. Loudly, this time.</p><p>In response, he swore. He tugged the half-knotted cravat loose and started all over again.</p><p>So much for a dramatic entrance from the doorway. The soles of her new slippers glided over the carpet as she covered the space between them. He flicked her a brief glance, then turned his attention back to his cravat.</p><p>\u201cWell ...?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He frowned at the reflected knot of linen. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys! You scarcely looked at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to,\u201d he said, his brow knitting in concentration as he unworked the knot for a third attempt. \u201cYou always look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ...\u201d But this will be my first evening out in fashionable society, and I\u2019m terribly afraid that every person in the Theatre Royal will turn on cue, take one look at me, and instantly know I\u2019m a country girl wearing a courtesan\u2019s discarded gown.</p><p>With a growl of disgust, he picked apart the cravat again. \u201cGoddamn fingers. Been broken one too many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down.\u201d She put a hand on his arm, turning him away from the mirror and toward her. \u201cLet me? If a simple knot will serve, I can do it. I did Father\u2019s for years.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and exhaled roughly as she wound and tied the cravat, tucking under the ends. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d His eyes fluttered open, and his sheepish gaze found hers. \u201cYou do look beautiful, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs beautiful as tulips?\u201d She smoothed her hands over his shoulders and lapels. Even if she had to feed him the compliments, she would take them. She was that desperate for reassurance.</p><p>\u201cA thousand times more.\u201d He kissed her brow, then offered his arm. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>As they stepped out into the street, Meredith felt herself go pale. She\u2019d wished she\u2019d thought to fortify herself with some courage of the liquid variety.</p><p>\u201cAshworth?\u201d The low voice came from behind them. \u201cAshworth, is that you?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Meredith froze. Here it was, her first social test. That smooth, cultured voice could not possibly belong to a servant or shopkeeper. She would be introduced. She would have to speak. And before all that, she would have to somehow turn around in this voluminous red gown and manage not to tangle herself into something that resembled fresh sausage links. Following Rhys\u2019s lead, she pivoted to face the newcomer. The tall, thin man bowed in greeting.</p><p>Rhys returned the bow, more fluidly than Meredith would have expected. \u201cCorning,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat an unexpected pleasure.\u201d</p><p>So curious, that she\u2019d not seen Rhys bow before. All throughout their day in Bath, she\u2019d noted an aristocratic grace to his movements that wasn\u2019t often on display in Buckleigh-in-the-Moor. Well, and to whom would he be bowing there? He was the lord. Everyone in Buckleigh-in-the-Moor ought to be bowing to him.</p><p>It was at that moment\u2014several seconds too late for etiquette\u2014that Meredith remembered to curtsy. Damn, damn, damn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUnexpected indeed,\u201d Corning said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware you were in Bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d Rhys replied. \u201cUntil just last night.\u201d</p><p>They all stood there awkwardly for a moment, staring at one another. Meredith took in the understated luxury of the man\u2019s garments. They\u2019d just come from the draper\u2019s that morning; she knew what such fine cloth cost. She knew that kind of quality tailoring came even more dear.</p> <p>For his part, the newcomer\u2019s curious, mildly horrified gaze flicked over Meredith\u2019s red silk gown.</p><p>Oh, dear. She\u2019d just known she must look like a whore.</p><p>Shifting his weight, Rhys brushed a protective touch over her lower back. \u201cMrs. Maddox of Devonshire, allow me to present Lord Henry Twill, Viscount Corning. I served with his younger brother in Portugal.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord. He must be a duke\u2019s son. The man inclined his head, and Meredith curtsyed again, more deeply this time. Panicked thoughts tumbled in her mind. Words stuck on her tongue. How did one properly address a duke\u2019s son, anyhow? As \u201cYour Grace\u201d or \u201cmy lord\u201d?</p><p>In the end, she couldn\u2019t say anything. By way of compensation, she forced a wan smile.</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Maddox, is it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded mutely. She was a fool. It seemed anything she could utter would indict her as a fraud\u2014but in the end, her silence made the confession on its own.</p><p>\u201cCharmed.\u201d His tone communicated anything but.</p><p>Whatever mild degree of interest the man had shown in her cooled instantly. He pointedly turned his gaze, and it was as though she\u2019d ceased to exist.</p><p>By mutual unspoken agreement, they parted ways with Lord Corning soon thereafter.</p><p>What a disaster. Meredith wondered if she could ever move amongst such people and not feel like an impostor. If she were to marry Rhys and become Lady Ashworth, she supposed she would have to learn to do just that. But she wasn\u2019t equal to the challenge tonight.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d she ventured, \u201cI\u2019m not certain I really feel like going to the theater. Will you be terribly disappointed if we don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, as if to gauge her sincerity. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he finally said. \u201cDid you want to go back to the hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we walk for a while? There\u2019s so much of Bath we haven\u2019t seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. Shall we head toward the river?\u201d</p><p>Nodding her agreement, she put her arm in his, and together they strolled down the avenue. Slowly, in deference to Meredith\u2019s skirts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for earlier, with Lord Corning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be.\u201d She bit her lip, abashed by the fact that he\u2019d noticed the gentleman\u2019s treatment of her, too. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment, as if he were debating whether to take her comment as forgiveness or an invitation to further discussion. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, sometimes, for men like him to greet me. I understand it; it can\u2019t be helped. When Corning and I cross paths, naturally I remind him of the brother he lost. I can see it in his eyes, when he looks at me. He\u2019s asking himself why a man like me survived when his brother did not.\u201d Rhys sighed heavily. \u201cIt\u2019s a question I can\u2019t answer. There\u2019s no satisfactory answer at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait a moment.\u201d Meredith slowed, tugging on his arm. Eventually they both pulled to a halt. \u201cAre you saying you believe Lord Corning\u2019s awkwardness in that meeting was all about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course. What else would it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, you silly man.\u201d She laughed. \u201cHe thought he\u2019d interrupted you with your lady of the evening.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her as though she\u2019d gone mad. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys, I saw the way he looked at me. He dismissed me as he would a serving girl.\u201d</p><p>He simply shook his head and turned, pressing on.</p><p>After a few minutes, he said, \u201cYou saw him as disapproving of you. I thought him disapproving of me. Funny, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Not only funny, but a strange relief. Why hadn\u2019t she seen it? Rhys felt like an impostor here, too. She ought to have recognized it earlier, from the way he\u2019d wrestled his cravat. He\u2019d been nervous, just as she had been.</p><p>Tilting her head to the twilight sky, she mused, \u201cDo you know what I think? I have a feeling that dour look on Lord Corning\u2019s face had nothing to do with either of us. Perhaps he\u2019d just tasted something unpleasant. Or more likely, his purgative was taking effect at a most inopportune moment.\u201d</p><p>They chuckled together and continued strolling down the shop-lined street.</p><p>\u201cWhich way shall we go?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo you wish to see the Orange Grove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, let\u2019s. I adore oranges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any there. The park is named for William of Orange, not the fruit. No oranges to be had. Not much of a grove either, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Of course.\u201d She went silent, feeling inexpressibly stupid.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he went on, \u201cthere are surely oranges to be had, somewhere. And if you adore them, you shall have them. Let\u2019s walk down to Sydney Gardens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are there actual gardens there? Or will I reveal my ignorance again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActual gardens, yes.\u201d He bent his head and lowered his voice. \u201cPleasure gardens.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse responded quickly to that promise, and only quickened as they made the walk across the Pulteney Bridge, crowded with vendors and shops.</p><p>As predicted, they soon came upon a girl hawking oranges. Rhys purchased three, tucking one in either of his pockets and tossing the third to her. Meredith held it between her hands as they walked, periodically lifting the exotic fruit to her nose and breathing deep.</p><p>She carried that orange in her gloved hands as they crossed the bridge and paused to gape at the grand homes in Laura Place. Just a short distance more, and they reached the Gardens themselves. Here there was yet more grandeur to be seen. The ancient ruins of a castle, which Rhys informed her was not truly ancient at all, but rather a modern construction. A bowling green and a labyrinth, and of course, all the fashionable people walking to and fro. Plumes bobbed in the perfumed breeze as a clutch of matrons approached. More than one turned a curious eye on Meredith and Rhys, and a titter of gossip rose as they walked past.</p><p>Here was that uncomfortable moment again, where they stood in silence. Meredith supposed both she and Rhys were suspecting the ladies\u2019 disapproval to be reserved individually for them.</p><p>\u201cI hear music,\u201d she said. Because, although they hadn\u2019t been speaking, a change of subject seemed a welcome thing.</p><p>\u201cThere are concerts, most nights.\u201d He paused awhile before asking, \u201cDid you wish to attend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered quickly. \u201cNo, let\u2019s just stroll a bit.\u201d</p><p>They ambled aimlessly until they found a quiet, picturesque bridge overlooking a canal. Here they paused, listening to the faint strains of the orchestra waft through the trees. Alone with Rhys, she felt more safe.</p><p>He looked at the orange she still carried. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to eat it?\u201d When she hesitated, he motioned to her. \u201cGive it here. I\u2019ll peel it for you.\u201d</p><p>She surrendered the orange to him, and he bit the rind to make a flap. She watched as he carefully shelled the sectioned fruit within, removing every bit of peel and membrane, tossing the bits into the canal. Watching him reminded her of that first breakfast they\u2019d shared, and the way he\u2019d balanced an egg in his big, strong fingers.</p><p>Her mouth watered in anticipation. She removed her gloves. The aroma of orange grew stronger and stronger, and perhaps it was only her fancy, but the distant strains of the music seemed to grow more melodic, more sweet. The pleasure gardens began to live up to their name.</p><p>Dividing the fruit with his fingers, he offered her half. She accepted, separating one section and popping it into her mouth. The juicy tang of the orange flooded her tongue, and she gave an involuntary moan.</p><p>Side by side, elbows propped on the rail, they remained there. Two people who would never belong to the crowd, happily belonging to each other. Eating an orange in sticky, blissful silence, until it was completely gone.</p><p>Meredith licked her lips. They tasted of orange, sweet and tart with just a hint of bitter rind. She wondered if his lips would taste the same. But even dressed in a courtesan\u2019s gown, she wasn\u2019t bold enough to kiss him in a public park.</p><p>\u201cAnother?\u201d he asked, withdrawing a second orange from his pocket.</p><p>She nodded and held out her hand. \u201cAllow me, this time.\u201d</p><p>As she lifted it to her mouth, she reconsidered. It would look unladylike, perhaps, to bite the rind as he had done. Instead, she dug in with her thumbnail to separate the peel. She misjudged and pressed too deep. Juice erupted, splattering her hand. She bobbled the orange, and down it went. Down into the canal, meeting its poetic end with an extravagant splash.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Sticky hands frozen helpless in front of her, Meredith leaned her belly against the rail. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. What a waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d He took her juice-spattered hand and lifted it to his lips.</p><p>To the casual observer, it must have looked the most innocent thing imaginable\u2014a gentleman chastely kissing his lady\u2019s hand.</p><p>The casual observer would have been deceived. Most wickedly so.</p><p>Pressing his parted lips to her knuckles, he licked each one. Then his tongue traced the sensitive seams between her fingers. Each furtive swipe sent a bolt of lightning shooting to her thighs, curling in the space between.</p><p>Once he\u2019d finished her knuckles, he turned her hand palm up and bent his head.</p><p>\u201cRhys,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThere are people about.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her, lifting her hand to his face and curling her fingers over his cheek, so it would look to anyone passing by as though she were cupping his face. All the while, his tongue did wicked things, tracing the lines of her palm and loving the delicate pulse at her wrist. Her nipples went hard, and her sex went oh-so-soft.</p><p>And just when she thought she could not possibly become more aroused by a kiss on the hand, he proved her wrong.</p><p>He sucked her thumb into his mouth.</p><p>She almost cried out; it was a close thing. But his eyes held hers, forbidding her to make a sound as he swirled his tongue in insidious circles, then pulled with delicious, bone-melting suction. Her eyelashes fluttered and her breath came quick. A sudden weakness in her knees had her gripping the rail with her other hand and leaning her weight toward him.</p><p>At last, he gave her back her hand. He said simply, \u201cThere. Nothing gone to waste. Shall we walk back?\u201d He offered his arm.</p><p>Still reeling from his kiss, she took it gratefully. \u201cI\u2019m not certain I remember how to walk just now.\u201d Licking her lips, she added, \u201cThere\u2019s still another orange, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I\u2019m saving it.\u201d He leaned over to whisper in her ear. \u201cI\u2019ll finish you later.\u201d</p><p>Well, and now she lost all sense of coordination.</p><p>Fortunately, he was tall and strong and steady, and he kept her tucked close.</p><p>\u201cWe are in Bath,\u201d he said as they crossed back over the River Avon. \u201cIt seems we ought to at least walk by the baths and Pump Room. They\u2019re on our way back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>Meredith couldn\u2019t imagine why he would wish to prolong the walk back, but she said, \u201cIf you like.\u201d</p><p>They strolled a few blocks down the bank. The faint odor of sulfur reached her nostrils as they approached a grand stone building fronted with plate windows and a great many steps.</p><p>\u201cThe Pump Room,\u201d he announced. \u201cYou can\u2019t see them from the street, but the baths are just there, to the side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very grand. But I imagine it\u2019s closed for the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d He gave her a conspiratorial look. \u201cTo most.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>The night guard was an army man. Rhys had seen it straightaway in the way he patrolled, marching briskly back and forth, turning on a penny at the end of each pass. He introduced himself as Lieutenant Colonel St. Maur, newly Lord Ashworth, and all due deference was immediately forthcoming. After a few minutes of reminiscing and polite inquiries after the former soldier\u2019s family, Rhys only had to drop the hint. \u201cMy lady here\u201d\u2014he tilted his head in Meredith\u2019s direction\u2014\u201chas been longing for a glimpse of the baths, but we\u2019re set to leave town early tomorrow. Don\u2019t suppose you could see your way clear to ...\u201d</p><p>A wink, a smile, and a rattle of keys\u2014and he and Meredith were inside.</p> <p>Alone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite mysterious at night, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Her voice echoed off the stone colonnade as they walked the edge of the rectangular pool. The colonnade was covered, but the water itself was open to the night sky. Above them, the moon and stars worked in concert to illuminate the space, unhampered by clouds and diffused by the steam of the hot spring.</p><p>Though it was impossible to see across the pool to the other side of the colonnade, Rhys could see Meredith quite clearly, and that was all he cared about. The steam curled the wisps of hair at her temples and loosened the creases from her gown. It also misted her pale complexion, and those strong curves of her face had the sheen of alabaster, carved and polished to a gleam.</p><p>She walked around the perimeter of the mineral bath, letting her ungloved fingertips graze each column as she passed. \u201cSo this is the center of Bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIts raison d\u2019\u00eatre,\u201d he confirmed.</p> <p>\u201cPeople of means will travel from all over England to come here, spend untold sums on rented rooms and amusements, all to be near this smelly basin of water. Amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just the waters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. It\u2019s the high fashion. The society. The promise of health and the allure of a pagan legend. I read the Romans had a temple to Minerva here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare to have a bath?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her nose wrinkled. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, running a fingertip along the slope of her shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s no one to see.\u201d A moonlit, private bath in an ancient spring? If this wasn\u2019t romantic, Rhys didn\u2019t know what was.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, no,\u201d she said stoutly. \u201cWe haven\u2019t any towels with us, and it smells horrid. I don\u2019t want to go back to Devonshire smelling of rotten eggs. Besides, don\u2019t invalids stew in there all day? It\u2019s ... it\u2019s like a broth of disease.\u201d</p><p>Well, then. When she put it that way ... Not so romantic after all.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cShall we be off?\u201d</p><p>As they left the baths, she said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be offended. Thank you so much for showing me this place. I\u2019m glad to have seen it. And I adore bathing with you, as you well know. I\u2019d just prefer the tub at our hotel. Or the pool at home.\u201d</p><p>She gasped and stopped dead in the street. \u201cBut that\u2019s it. The pool. Of course, that\u2019s the answer.\u201d</p><p>Rhys had no idea what her little epiphany involved, but as she went quiet to sort it out, he seized the opportunity to admire her. The adorable way her brow wrinkled in concentration. The little flutter of her fingers as they made brisk calculations. The breathless excitement in her manner. He knew the signs. Whatever it was she was working out, it must have something to do with the inn.</p><p>A realization settled in his gut. It was always the inn. She lived for that place. It brought her trouble and hard work, yes. But it also brought her joy. All this time, he\u2019d been assuming that once her initial wariness wore off, she\u2019d gladly accept the advantages of marrying him. But now he wondered ... if he offered her a true choice between the two, would he even stand a chance?</p><p>She bounced across the street to his side, and when she spoke again, her whole face lit from within. Like a small, round moon floating along in the dark.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the pool, don\u2019t you see? We have a spring of our own in Buckleigh-in-the-Moor. One with water that flows crisp and sweet, not malodorous and revolting. And we have a natural place for bathing, far more picturesque than a Roman bath. Heavens, we have our own actual ruins. We don\u2019t need to go about constructing them, as they did for the Gardens.\u201d</p><p>She put her arm through his and pulled him along, keeping up her steady stream of plans. \u201cNaturally, the village could never hope to have the fashionable or cultural pull of Bath, but we might be able to style it as some sort of spa. We only have to spread word of the waters, and their healthful benefits. And come up with some sort of pagan legend for Darryl to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there one already? I thought every nook and cranny of the moor had a story attached to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she said, \u201cbut most of them are frightening. All witches and curses and ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiving phantoms?\u201d He pinched her midsection playfully and whispered, \u201cBoo.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. The thing to do is start with a classic tale, but twist it to our purpose. You\u2019ve had all that Eton education. What are some legends to do with pools and lakes? Romantic ones, not the ghoulish sort.\u201d</p><p>He thought on for a moment. \u201cDo you want something Arthurian and medieval? There\u2019s always the Lady of the Lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t do. Why would people want to take baths in a pool with some shriveled, soggy woman lurking at the bottom of it? She might grab their ankles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEcho and Narcissus?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cHow does that one go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no storyteller like Darryl. I don\u2019t think I even remember it correctly.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his arm. \u201cJust do your best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as I recall, Narcissus was a good-looking fellow. Beautiful, they said, and very vain. He spent all his time gazing at his own reflection in a pool. And Echo\u2014she was a nymph\u2014she was in love with him, I suppose. But she had a curse or something, and she had no words of her own. She was only able to repeat what others said to her. So he would sit by the pool, and she would just stand behind him quietly adoring. Until one day, Narcissus said to his own reflection, \u2018I love you,\u2019 and Echo was at long last able to say \u2018I love you\u2019 to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vain fool never took notice of her. She wasted away to just an echo of her voice. And he stared at his own reflection until he went mad with frustration and stabbed himself.\u201d Rhys chuckled.</p><p>Meredith didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t say anything for a good long while.</p><p>They turned the street corner, and the way was more shadowed. The night had grown late, and they were alone. She clutched his arm in the dark.</p><p>\u201cMerry? Are you well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to watch you.\u201d</p><p>They stopped walking.</p><p>\u201cI used to watch you,\u201d she repeated, turning to him by slow degrees. First her head pivoted, then her body. Finally, she lifted her chin and looked him in the face. \u201cAt the pool. When I was a girl. I used to follow you there in secret and hide behind the rocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Rhys felt as though he\u2019d had the breath knocked out of him. He was stunned. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was wrong, I know it.\u201d Her words were a rush. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have. But I was young and ... and curious.\u201d</p><p>Curious? Anger swelled inside him. The same as it always did, when he picked himself up from a blow.</p><p>Grasping her by the elbow, he pulled her into a darkened alcove where a small flight of stairs met the street. \u201cJust what did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d She swallowed hard. Her lip trembled. \u201cAll of you.\u201d</p><p>His heart stalled for a moment, until his vicious oath spurred it back to life.</p><p>That pool had been his refuge after a beating. His one safe place. There he would examine the damage to his body, soothe his wounds with the cool spring water, try to wash himself clean of the blood and shame. And to think, someone had been spying on him from the rocks, all that time? It churned his stomach. He\u2019d been naked, in every way. Vulnerable. All those purpling bruises and raw, angry welts ... she\u2019d seen them. She\u2019d seen them all.</p><p>It had taken him years to cover all the wounds his father had wrought. He\u2019d healed from some and hidden the rest under other, newer scars. Or at least, he thought he\u2019d hidden them. But he hadn\u2019t. Meredith had seen them. Every single one. Even the ones he couldn\u2019t have seen himself.</p><p>Adding to that mortification, he\u2019d been an adolescent with natural male impulses, desperate for even a fleeting moment of pleasure ...</p><p>Damn it to hell. So that\u2019s how she knew he favored his left hand.</p><p>He dragged in a breath and choked on the air. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys, please.\u201d</p><p>He turned away, disgusted. Disgusted with her, in some measure. But mostly disgusted by himself. Had he truly dreamed that Meredith would marry him? Willingly? Even women who hadn\u2019t been witness to such shame were repelled by his touch.</p><p>He tugged at his cravat, pulling it loose from his throat. The air felt too thick to breathe. She knew. She knew everything.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She grabbed his sleeve and laid her other hand to his cheek, tugging him to face her. He turned his head, but he still couldn\u2019t bear to meet her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. \u201cIt was terribly wrong of me, and I know that now. But I followed you everywhere. I couldn\u2019t help it. You were strong and wild and always in motion, and everything I wished I could be, and I ... I was fascinated by you. Infatuated, to tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>A derisive laugh caught in his throat. \u201cInfatuated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied, her voice strengthening. \u201cYes. I adored you. I was mad for you. God help me, I still am now.\u201d</p><p>She slid both hands to his face and pulled his head down, brushing a kiss to his jaw, then the corner of his mouth. Then his cheek. Then each of his closed eyes in turn. His own hands stayed clenched in fists at his sides. Part of him was aching for the closeness, but he didn\u2019t trust himself to touch her.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, pressing her cheek to his. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t be ashamed. And don\u2019t be angry with me, I can\u2019t bear it. I\u2019m so sorry. I was a foolish girl, with a girl\u2019s foolish dreams. I just wanted to be near you, in whatever way I could.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his lips. Desire ricocheted down his spine.</p><p>\u201cRhys,\u201d she whispered, sliding her arms around his neck. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. It was just like the story. You were so very beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She rested her brow against his chin. He felt her breath drifting over his throat. Fast and hot, as if she were afraid, or aroused, or both. On his side, definitely both. His chest rose and fell with each ragged gasp.</p><p>He had no secrets left. No defenses. He had nothing, except that same vast, dark, empty, infinite ache that had resided in him for as long as he could remember. An endless flight of stairs, leading down and down into the cold, dark pit of his soul. Now, at long last, he\u2019d reached the absolute rock bottom. And there she was, just standing there. She\u2019d been there all along.</p><p>He cursed her. He blessed her. He needed her. Now.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d The words scraped from his throat. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The soft hiss of the word slid over his skin. He clenched his fists at his sides, grappling with his emotions. \u201cI can\u2019t be gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She lifted her face to his. \u201cJust be quick.\u201d</p><p>And once they\u2019d made the agreement to join, they immediately separated. They each took a step back and began wrestling with their own clothing. Because that was the fastest way.</p><p>Rhys tossed a glance over his shoulder as he wrenched open his trouser placket and flicked loose the closures of his smalls. There was no one in the street. Even if there had been a crowd of onlookers, he wasn\u2019t sure he could have stopped. The need to get inside her was as intense and primal as any he\u2019d ever known. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time he turned back, she had her skirts and petticoats hiked above her knees\u2014just high enough that he could glimpse the ribbon ties of her garters and the milk-white skin above. Her inner thigh quivered. Perversely, he wanted to bite her there.</p><p>But there was no time for that.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d she whispered, leaning back against the wall and canting her hips in invitation.</p> <p>He freed his erection and knew a moment of cool night air before finding her waiting heat. Lifting her by the hips, he thrust into her tight sheath. Again and again, plunging a little deeper each time, feeling her body give him more, and yet more, but still not quite enough. He worked harder, boring into her with insistent thrusts, determined to penetrate her just as deeply as he could. It still wouldn\u2019t compare to how she\u2019d invaded him.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d he growled. \u201cTake it all.\u201d</p><p>At his words, she came apart. Her teeth scraped the tendon of his neck as she stifled her cry of ecstasy. Her intimate muscles clamped down, making his way even more difficult, but ratcheting the pleasure to an unfathomable degree. And he kept thrusting, pushing through the exquisite resistance, until he sank all the way to the root.</p><p>Ah, God. So good. So good.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she whispered frantically. \u201cThere\u2019s someone ...\u201d</p> <p>He froze. Light footsteps clattered down the cobblestone street, ever louder. Ever closer.</p><p>He pressed her into the furthest corner of the alcove, guarding her body with his. With his dark clothes, they would melt into the shadows and remain unnoticed. He hoped. Their combined breath was a dull roar in his ears, and his heartbeat knocked loudly against hers. He could only be still and pray their passion wasn\u2019t audible from the street.</p><p>All the while, the last tremors of her release caressed his arousal, teasing him to an unbearable peak of tension. Not helping the cause of silence.</p><p>By the time the footsteps finally faded, Rhys\u2019s legs were shaking with need. He withdrew and thrust again.</p><p>Sweet mercy. This was rapture.</p><p>Their forced interruption had heightened every sensation. Not just heightened\u2014multiplied. In that spirit, he doubled his pace, stroking into her with abandon. The base of his spine tingled in anticipation. So close. So close.</p> <p>A hoarse shout tore from his chest as pleasure exploded inside him, blanking his vision and driving out everything else.</p><p>He slumped against her chest, pinning her to the wall. Pure joy simmered and hummed in unlikely parts of his body. His stiff finger. His damaged left knee. The scarred, wounded chest that covered his wildly thumping heart. For this one blessed moment, pleasure was all he knew.</p><p>\u201cMerry, I ...\u201d Words failed him. He just stood there, panting into her hair, just waiting for her to tell him what came next. Because damned if he knew anymore.</p><p>\u201cAsk me,\u201d she whispered in his ear. He could hear a smile in her voice. \u201cKnow that I don\u2019t believe in fate, or destiny, or anything else except what lies between us, right here, right now. Now ask me to marry you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. As he pulled in a deep breath, her jasmine scent permeated his very being. He could taste her sweet nectar on his tongue. All this could be his, so easily.</p><p>And he was about to do the most damn fool thing of his life.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d He cleared his throat and pulled away to look her in the eye. \u201cBut I must tell you something first.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p> <p>\u201cYou need to tell me something?\u201d Meredith felt her smile spreading into a silly, cheek-stretching grin. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Please, she thought. Please let it be I love you. And then, like Echo, she could say the words back. Not just once, but a hundred times. I love you, I love you. I have always loved you. I will love you so hard and hold you so tight, I will make everything better. Every instance of pain will be forgotten, and from this moment forward, you will only know bliss.</p><p>But as the silence stretched, Meredith felt her smile fading. \u201cAre there more than three words involved?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cMost definitely.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were so earnest, so troubled. He seemed to have missed her hopeful hint completely. Which, in that case, was probably for the best.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She became suddenly conscious of the stone digging into her shoulder blade. \u201cThen ... may I lower my skirts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew from her body and tucked himself back in, refastening his trousers in haste. The cravat was a lost cause. He wadded it up and stuffed it in his pocket, where it shared the space with that last orange. Meredith felt, with a sad, sudden certainty, they would never eat it.</p><p>She shook out her skirts and smoothed them down.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s walk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to converse that way.\u201d He took her by the hand and led her out of the shadows. The street being deserted, they promenaded down the absolute center at a stately pace. A parade of two. Her heart served as the pounding bass drum.</p><p>\u201cAfter what you told me, earlier ...\u201d He rubbed his neck with his free hand. \u201cI gather you know my father and I ... Well, we didn\u2019t get on.\u201d</p><p>The understatement was so great, so absurd\u2014she had to bite back an incredulous laugh. \u201cYes. I know he beat you. Regularly. Severely.\u201d For her part, she wasn\u2019t going to mince words. If he wanted to talk about it, they were going to talk about it. He\u2019d been holding his silence for far too long. \u201cUntil that last summer,\u201d she added softly. \u201cWhat made him stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grew too big. I came home from Eton four inches taller and two stone heavier than when I\u2019d left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>He looked askance at her, as though questioning why she should have noticed such a thing. She shrugged. How could she not?</p><p>\u201cI came back to Nethermoor that summer,\u201d he said, \u201cand for the first time I stood taller than my father. I was younger than him, and healthier, too. We both knew I could best him in a fair fight. So the next time he tried to order me into the cellar ... I simply stood tall and said, \u2018No. Not anymore.\u2019 And that was the end of it.\u201d</p><p>She hugged his arm. \u201cThat was very brave of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was stupid, is what it was. He was enraged, and the fury had no outlet. One night, a few weeks later, I came back from a ride to find him in the stables. He was worked into a frenzy, whipping a mare for only the Devil knows what reason. The grooms were powerless to stop him. Your father wasn\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>Her whole body tensed.</p><p>He noticed. \u201cI gather you know where this story is going.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Queasiness puddled thickly in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI fought him,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in the scuffle, I knocked a lamp into the straw. That\u2019s how the fire began.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. No, no, no. This was her every worst fear coming true.</p><p>She reeled to a halt and turned to him, eyes wide and burning with tearful fatigue. She wished she could shut them and just sleep. Pretend this conversation wasn\u2019t happening. \u201cBut ...\u201d The word fell off her trembling lips.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He sighed heavily. \u201cYou know how it went from there. The horses ... most of them died. Horrible, agonizing deaths. Your father was crippled trying to save them. The entire estate was lost, plunging the village into economic depression. And not a day has gone by in the fourteen years since that I haven\u2019t thought of that night. Dreamed of it. And wished that I\u2019d died instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Her hand went to her mouth. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly blame yourself.\u201d</p><p>Fool thing to say. Obviously, he could. And had, for all the years since. The realization seized her heart and wrung it hard. She couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have fought him back. He wanted to beat that horse. I should have just let him beat me. I\u2019d taken countless beatings from him over the years. If I\u2019d just taken one more, none of it would have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say such a thing? That fire, it ... it was an accident. It wasn\u2019t your fault, Rhys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in accidents. And it hardly matters whether or not I own the blame. The responsibility is mine, the duty to make it right. I\u2019m Lord Ashworth now, much as I prayed I\u2019d never live to inherit that title.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ...\u201d A wave of dizziness unsteadied her. \u201cI think I need to sit down.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her over to a small row of steps leading up to a narrow stoop and urged her to sit on the topmost riser.</p><p>Then he sank to one knee before her.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to hide it from you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou deserve to know the truth. And I need you to know it. If you marry me ...\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed off. Meredith was struck by the significance of what he\u2019d just said. If. For the first time, he\u2019d used the word \u201cif.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you marry me,\u201d he repeated slowly, \u201cyou\u2019ll be waking up every morning next to the man responsible for your father\u2019s injuries, the village\u2019s plight, your own years of work and sacrifice. I need to know you can live with that.\u201d He held up an open palm. \u201cDon\u2019t answer me right now. Think on it, good and hard, before you decide. You were right. I owe you this much, to offer you a real choice.\u201d</p><p>His big hands engulfed hers where they lay folded in her lap. \u201cI swear, if you give me the chance, I will fix everything.\u201d Sincerity rang in his voice. \u201cI vow to you before God, I will take care of your father for the rest of his years. I will make certain the villagers never go hungry. And I will devote all the strength of my body and all the determination of my soul to the purpose of making you happy. All I ask of you is the chance.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, shivering with emotion.</p><p>\u201cI need this, Meredith. I need to make it right, or I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll go on.\u201d His eyes squeezed shut. \u201cPlease. Marry me.\u201d</p><p>A tear streaked down her face. Lord, this was terrible. And not in the way he believed. Even if he had knocked over that lamp, she would never hold him blameworthy for that fire, nor any of its consequences. But could she truly consent to marry him, knowing that he viewed their marriage as a sort of penance for sins that weren\u2019t even his own?</p><p>Perhaps she could, and that was the worst part of all. Even now, the word \u201cyes\u201d hovered on her tongue. She wanted him so much. Maybe she truly had it in her to let him live under that perpetual burden of guilt and keep him for herself, always. Maybe she could even trick herself into believing that if only she loved him fiercely enough, it would all be for the best, in the end. Did she have the capacity for a lifetime of deceit? She was a little afraid to look within herself and find out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll think on it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She managed a nod. \u201cCan we go home? Tomorrow?\u201d She tightened her fingers around his. At home, everything would be clear. There, she would know what to do. \u201cRhys, will you just take me home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you wish ...\u201d Wearing a grim expression, he rose to his feet. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>She talked all the way home.</p><p>Rhys had never known Meredith could have so many words to speak and so very little to say. As the coach rolled on through Somersetshire and Devonshire, their cargo of porcelain and silver clinked in crates above them, whilst Meredith kept up a steady rattle of her own. He supposed she was afraid that if she stopped talking for any significant length of time, he would come forth with another shocking revelation. He didn\u2019t know how to reassure her that there were none left. So he simply sat and listened\u2014the sound of her voice was never hard on his ears. Every once and a while, she would go pensive for a bit, but soon she\u2019d burst forth with an entirely new topic. All of them, however, had something to do with the inn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided what to work on improving next, once the new wing is completed.\u201d Without waiting for his encouragement, she continued, \u201cI need to help Mr. Handsford smarten up his house, and add a fresh coat of limewash to the church.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He silently pondered the meaning of those two gestures, knowing he wouldn\u2019t need to ask for an explanation.</p><p>Sure enough, one was soon forthcoming. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing I learned from the hotel in Bath,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember we had that lovely view of the river? It\u2019s not only the outward appearance of the inn that\u2019s important, it\u2019s the prospect a guest will see from her room. The church and Mr. Handsford\u2019s cottage are directly across the road. They can be seen from each new room\u2019s windows, so we need to be certain they\u2019re looking their best. The entire village needs to look its best. Clean, bright, cheery. Perhaps we\u2019ll paint all the shutters and sashes red.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Just gave a low grunt of agreement and turned his face to the window.</p> <p>\u201cOh, but the visitors are the most important thing. If only we could be assured some guests of quality, to spread word of the spa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose a duke and his duchess would serve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA duke? Do you know one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know several. But the Duke of Morland owes me a favor. You\u2019d like his wife a great deal, I think.\u201d Rhys had hoped to invite the couple to Devonshire sometime soon. But he\u2019d envisioned Meredith welcoming them as Lady Ashworth, not as landlady of the Three Hounds.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She clapped her hands together. \u201cThat would be ideal. I shall have to make up the new corner room to perfection. The ducal suite.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed. Her answer must be no, then. That was the only explanation for her nervous energy and her persistent focus on the inn. She was already preparing for a life without him.</p><p>Damn it. He knew he shouldn\u2019t have told her the truth.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t officially refused him yet. He still had some time to change her mind. Or perhaps the cottage could. She hadn\u2019t been out to see it in a while. With the windows and doors cut out and the roof freshly thatched, it looked cozy and welcoming, if rustic. And if it was scenery she\u2019d grown to value, she should see the prospect from her dormer window. Perhaps she\u2019d fall in love with the view.</p><p>Right.</p><p>Again they made good time on the journey, and a smoky dusk was just settling as they reached the border of the moor.</p><p>\u201cIs it much farther?\u201d she asked, peering out into the twilight.</p> <p>\u201cTen or twelve miles, I should say. Another hour or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the looks of this weather. A mist will be on us soon.\u201d She took a rug from the coach\u2019s underseat compartment and shrank into the corner of the bench, wrapping the woven blanket over her legs. To Rhys, seated on the opposite side, she looked very small. And very far away.</p><p>A mist did indeed bloom from the humid moorland air, enveloping the coach and making for much slower progress. The lamps illuminated a small section of the road ahead\u2014enough that the carriage could safely continue, albeit at a slower pace. But the final hour of their journey stretched into three, and it was full night when they rolled into Buckleigh-in-the-Moor.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t be expecting us tonight,\u201d she said.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell whether or not she looked forward to surprising them.</p><p>In the end, however, he and Meredith were the ones taken by surprise. The moment the coach rolled to a halt in the courtyard of the Three Hounds, a man rushed out from the stables to greet them. The mist was so thick, Rhys could barely make him out as George Lane until they\u2019d alighted from the coach and he stood two feet in front of them.</p><p>\u201cMerry, Rhys.\u201d He coughed, clearly out of breath. \u201cThank the Lord you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather.\u201d Meredith gripped the old man\u2019s arm. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, what is it? What\u2019s happened? Are you well?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d He broke off coughing again. \u201cIt\u2019s Cora. She\u2019s missing. We only just realized it a half hour ago, but no one\u2019s seen the girl since the noon meal. Mrs. Ware says she might remember her expressing an intent to go up toward the cottage. The men were supposed to be working late up there today, finishing the floors. Perhaps she thought to take them some extra food? I don\u2019t know. But the men came back not an hour ago. None of them had seen her. And with this mist ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Meredith choked out.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to explain the dangers to Rhys. Cora could be lost anywhere on the moor. She might have wandered into the bog or stumbled down a slope. And if she were caught out overnight with no protection from the elements ...</p><p>He put an arm about Meredith\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her. I\u2019ll find her.\u201d He tried to sound reassuring, but the truth was, if the girl had been missing for several hours in this weather, it didn\u2019t bode well. \u201cDo you have the men searching?\u201d he asked George Lane.</p><p>\u201cDarryl\u2019s organizing them in the tavern.\u201d</p><p>Darryl Tewkes was organizing? Rhys groaned. God help them all.</p><p>His face grim with resolve, Rhys headed straight for the inn. Meredith followed a step behind, chilled to the bone with fear. Even if Cora were a complete stranger, she would have worried for her safety in this situation. But in just a few short weeks, she\u2019d grown surprisingly fond of the girl. If they didn\u2019t find her ...</p><p>This was her reward for leaving on holiday. This village could not function without her. She should have known something horrid would happen. She should have never left. Rhys flung open the door to the public room, announcing his presence with a bang. Darryl, standing atop the bar, trailed off mid-sentence.</p><p>And then, a small miracle occurred. For the first time since Rhys\u2019s arrival in Buckleigh-in-the-Moor, the assembled men at the Three Hounds greeted him with a unanimously warm reception. Scattered words of thanksgiving rose up from the crowd, along with a hearty cheer. Relief softened every face in the room. Even the hounds came scrambling out from the kitchen, their claws clicking and sliding over the flagstones as they tumbled over one another in the race to nip at his boots.</p><p>And then all assembled went quiet, awaiting direction from their lord.</p><p>At some point over the past two months, Rhys had earned not only the respect of every soul in the village, but their trust, as well. In any other circumstance, Meredith\u2019s heart would have warmed to see it.</p><p>\u201cLamps,\u201d he said to Meredith. \u201cWe\u2019ll need lamps. As many as you can find. Torches, if you run out.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. After sending Darryl to collect the lamps from upstairs and the barn, she set about the task of filling and lighting them. From the storeroom, she could overhear all the goings-on in the tavern, where, with brusque, military authority, Rhys was rousing the men to action. He barked questions and waited for answers, divided the men into pairs and assigned each team an area to search. When the men came tromping through, single file, for their lamps, she and Darryl had them ready.</p><p>\u201cTewkes, you\u2019re with us. We\u2019re headed down the lane.\u201d Skinner jerked his head, and Darryl picked up a lamp and followed.</p><p>Rhys was last to come through. \u201cI\u2019m going up to the high moor. If she made it to the cottage, she probably had the good sense to stay there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going alone?\u201d Meredith asked. The others had already departed in groups. Naturally, Rhys would have saved the most harrowing and perilous section of the area for himself.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cStay here, in case she comes back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBollocks to that,\u201d Meredith said, lighting another lamp. \u201cI\u2019m going with you. I know the lay of the land better than you do. You\u2019re not going into that mist on your own.\u201d Before he could get the objection past his lips, she added, \u201cFather\u2019s here, if she returns. Just let me retrieve my boots and cloak.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened with uncertainty. She held his piercing gaze, refusing to flinch.</p><p>Finally, he gave her a curt nod of assent. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>She was up and down the back stairs in the space of a minute. Another few moments more, and she\u2019d wrestled into her thickest boots and exchanged the courtesan\u2019s traveling cape for her own cloak of sturdy brown wool. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>They headed through the tavern door and forged out into the gloom.</p><p>It was an eerie sight\u2014the men departing for the search. The cluster of lamps dispersing; the amber balls of light swallowed into the misty dark, one by one. The cries \u201cHullo!\u201d and \u201cHo, there!\u201d and \u201cCora, love!\u201d\u2014these too grew fainter and less frequent as the searchers scattered in every possible direction.</p><p>Meredith and Rhys began their slow ascent to the high moor. With visibility so poor, the ancient monks\u2019 path was the only safe route, though longer. The higher they climbed, the thicker the mist became, until Meredith felt as though she were swimming through milk. The lamps served only to illuminate the fog itself, giving it ghostly fingers and a deceptively comforting, cottony texture. They could see no more than a few paces in front of them.</p><p>\u201cCora! Cora, can you hear us?\u201d</p><p>They took turns calling out into the darkness. Between the exertion of the climb and the strain of shouting and the oily smoke of the lamp burning her nostrils, Meredith\u2019s throat was raw by the time they crested Bell Tor. They had a choice here: Veer off toward the cottage or head straight for the ruins of Nethermoor Hall.</p><p>\u201cCottage first,\u201d Rhys said, answering her unspoken question.</p><p>They made their way over to the flat, picking up pace as they did. The even ground made for faster progress, as did the fact that in building the cottage, Rhys had cleared the area of stones.</p><p>Still, they almost stumbled right into the cottage as it rose up out of the mist. Meredith put one hand to the freshly pared earthen wall and followed it round, until her fingers met with a new texture\u2014sanded wood.</p><p>\u201cThe door\u2019s been fitted and hung,\u201d she told him. She hadn\u2019t seen the house for a few weeks now. She\u2019d been so busy overseeing progress down at the inn.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he replied. \u201cGlad to know the men weren\u2019t just loafing about while we were in Bath.\u201d</p><p>The door wasn\u2019t latched, however, and it swung inward noiselessly. The clarity of the darkness within the house was almost startling, as the fog had not penetrated the walls. Meredith lifted her lamp and flinched when a beam of light bounced back at her, reflecting off the new windowpanes.</p><p>\u201cCora!\u201d They called out as one, lifting their voices to the rafters. \u201cCora, are you in here?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Meredith swore under her breath. Until this moment, she\u2019d managed to hold panic at bay. Now she felt it rattling at the windowpanes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll check the whole house anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cShe could be asleep somewhere. You look down here. I\u2019ll go upstairs.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Holding her lamp high, she began a slow circuit of the lower floor. The cottage had a simple arrangement, but a pleasing one. At one end was a large kitchen. It shared a double-sided hearth with the drawing room, which took up the center of the cottage. There were smaller rooms at the back\u2014larder, closet. She didn\u2019t find Cora in any of them. Then, at the opposite end of the ground floor there was a bedroom suite with its own separate hearth, complete with a small dressing room. It was all very thoughtful in its simplicity.</p><p>The stairs hadn\u2019t yet been completed, but there was a ladder up to the second floor. Climbing with one hand and gripping her lamp with the other, she made her way up the rungs until her head and shoulders emerged into the loft. \u201cAny luck up here?\u201d she asked, pushing her lamp onto the newly laid floorboards so she could use both hands to pull herself up.</p><p>\u201cNone. Downstairs?\u201d</p><p>Meredith couldn\u2019t answer him. And she wished she could say the reason for her silence was anxiety for poor Cora. But it wasn\u2019t. She\u2019d just taken her first good look at the second floor of the cottage, and what she saw simply stole her breath.</p><p>\u201cRhys, this is ...\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cThis is lovely.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t meant to see it yet.\u201d He came over and offered a hand as she managed the ladder\u2019s last few rungs.</p><p>The entire loft was open from end to end, making one large room. Only the chimney coming up from the kitchen divided the space. As below, it had dual hearths\u2014one facing a nook tucked under the eaves, the other situated to throw heat toward the rest of the room. The sharply sloping roof soared high above them in the center, but tapered to meet the tops of the windows at each edge. The rafters and thatch were left exposed, giving it a homey feel. The scent of freshly planed wood shavings filled the air.</p><p>As she slowly toured the space, he said, \u201cI hoped you\u2019d approve of our rooms\u2014or room, I should say\u2014being upstairs. The place is meant to be your father\u2019s eventually ... so with his legs, I thought it best to keep his bedchamber downstairs. Since it would be just us up here, and temporarily at that, I left it undivided and the ceiling unfinished. Gives us plenty of room for now, and once we move out the space can be used for storage or servants. I thought it cozy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery cozy,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d build a bed into this nook,\u201d he explained, walking over to the smaller space created by the hearth\u2019s division. \u201cNice and warm, you know, with the fire so close. And then\u201d\u2014energetic strides carried him to the opposite end\u2014\u201cshelves and cupboards at this end. In the middle, a sitting area. A desk for all your papers and such, right under this window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are these?\u201d she asked, picking up a misshapen lump of wood from a pile near the window.</p><p>\u201cThose are ...\u201d He darted over to take it from her hand, stepping between her and the rest of the heap. \u201cNot finished.\u201d</p><p>She craned her neck, trying to look around him. \u201cThey almost look like\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms and cocked her head. \u201cVery well. Don\u2019t tell me. We\u2019ll just stand here all night, denying the existence of little bits of wood.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes and sighed. \u201cFine.\u201d He took the lump of wood from behind his back and lobbed it at her.</p><p>She caught it easily and held it up for examination, turning it over in her hands. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s carved. These look like leaves.\u201d Looking up, she raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cIs it meant to be a pineapple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said impatiently, spearing a hand through his hair before snatching it from her grasp. \u201cIt is not a pineapple. It\u2019s meant to be a lily. I think.\u201d He kicked gently at the pile of wooden knobs, separating them. \u201cThere\u2019s a matching one here somewhere. As I said, they\u2019re not finished. The roses are coming out a little better. Have a look.\u201d He plucked another from the pile and held it out to her.</p><p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d The object in her hand resembled a wooden cabbage more than anything, but she wouldn\u2019t have said so for the world. \u201cWhat are they for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFinials, for the curtain rods. There are four windows up here, you see. I\u2019ve been working on a different set for each.\u201d He pointed to each window in turn. \u201cRoses. Lilies. Daisies.\u201d His touch landed on the windowpane at their side. \u201cTulips.\u201d</p><p>He took the wooden rose from her hand and gave it a rueful smile. \u201cI know they\u2019re pitiful. But the work gave me something to pass the time if I woke in the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy flowers?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI promised you flowers, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even answer, for the sharp pinch in her chest.</p><p>\u201cMy first attempts were far worse than these, if you can believe it. They came easier once I switched to my left hand. You gave me that idea.\u201d</p><p>Meredith turned to the window, unable to meet his gaze. \u201cTulips for this one, did you say? Then it must be the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d He put his hands on her shoulders and nudged her close to the glass. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a clear day, up this high, you can see for miles. And if you face the downslope and look very sharp, you can just make out a thin slice of blue, a shade darker than the sky. That\u2019s the ocean, Merry. Right off the Devonshire coast.\u201d His thumbs stroked her shoulders. \u201cOf course, you can\u2019t see it now.\u201d</p> <p>No. No, she couldn\u2019t. All she could see was the blackness outside reflecting their own image, like a mirror. Even in this imperfect, dark reflection, she could see the excitement in his expression, the spark in his eyes. All the emotion he\u2019d been holding back\u2014he\u2019d poured it all into this house. Not only emotion, but hard work and good faith.</p><p>They\u2019d built something too, between them. Just as he\u2019d said from the first. In the course of all those conversations and kisses and time spent in one another\u2019s company, they\u2019d pieced together something wonderful\u2014something with lace curtains and corner closets and an ocean view. Not just a house, but a loving home.</p><p>How would Rhys react when he learned it was all built on a foundation of misconceptions and needless guilt? Meredith didn\u2019t want to find out, but she needed to.</p><p>She had to tell him everything. Tonight.</p><p>His grip tightened on her shoulders. \u201cYou deserve so much more, but this is only the beginning. I\u2019m going to rebuild the whole estate in time, and you\u2019re going to live in true luxury. The finest furnishings, a whole fleet of servants. I promise, you\u2019ll never lift a finger again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t promise me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to. I owe it to you and your father both. You\u2019ve suffered for years on my account, and now it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She turned to face him. \u201cPlease don\u2019t speak to me of fate or fires or obligation.\u201d</p><p>Frowning a little, he smoothed the hair from her brow. \u201cMerry, I don\u2019t know what more I can say. I\u2019ve tried my best with the romance, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She gasped. Romance. \u201cOh, no. Oh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCora. We\u2019re here to find Cora.\u201d</p><p>Rhys swore viciously. How could he have forgotten their errand, for even one second? The guilt he felt was mirrored on Meredith\u2019s face.</p><p>Shrugging away from him, she went for her lamp. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent enough time here. We\u2019ve got to go search the ruins.\u201d Together they scrambled up the bluff. Once they reached the ruins of Nethermoor Hall, they separated at what remained of the front entrance and circled in opposite directions. Rhys took the outer perimeter, and Meredith followed the inner wall. They each stumbled and shouted their way around the ruin, calling Cora\u2019s name until they were hoarse. Nothing.</p><p>He reunited with Meredith at the crumbling arch. The glow of her lamp bobbed in the mist. The wind was picking up.</p><p>\u201cAny sign of her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Thunder rumbled in the distance. Perfect. Just what they needed, a storm. \u201cI suppose we should be getting back to the village, then. Perhaps she\u2019s turned up elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>The bobbing glow stilled. \u201cWe haven\u2019t checked every part of the ruin yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Though he knew damn well what she meant. Had he forgotten that place, truly? Or had he just wanted to forget it so fiercely that he\u2019d managed to wipe it from his mind? But Meredith was right ... if Cora had wandered up here, the cellar would have made a logical haven from the mist and cold. They would need to look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go alone,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t go alone. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d That place wasn\u2019t safe, not for anyone. It never had been. But he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d let her think that he\u2014who\u2019d faced down Napoleon\u2019s Imperial Guardsmen and hamfisted prizefighters alike\u2014was afraid of a damned cellar, filled with nothing but cobwebs and shadow.</p><p>Her light swayed as she transferred it from one hand to the other, and for a moment, the features of her face were caressed by soft, smoky light. With her free hand, she reached through the mist to take his. \u201cWe\u2019ll go together. And we\u2019ll do it quickly.\u201d</p><p>He allowed her to lead the way to the cellar entrance. She seemed to know the way better than he did. It was well-hidden now, obscured by haphazard piles of masonry. Hand in hand, they picked their way over the strewn boulders and found the stairway. The rocks teetered and clacked a bit as they scrambled over them.</p><p>The cellar must have been built from a natural cave that his ancestors had widened and deepened with time. Or perhaps they\u2019d quarried the stone for the house, then built right over the empty pit? At any rate, it made an ideal place for storing food and spirits\u2014protected from the elements, cool and dark. Silent. It made an ideal place to keep secrets, too.</p><p>As they descended into the dark pit, the sounds of the wind outside were muted. Meanwhile, their every step and sigh echoed off the walls. This place caught every sound, trapped it to rattle about and amplify. Each footfall, each spoken word ... each crack or blow ... seemed to have the strength of dozens.</p><p>\u201cCora?\u201d Meredith called out into the darkness. The name volleyed around the room, losing a bit of its consonant edge with each echo, until all that remained was a round, hollow ball of \u201cOh\u201d bouncing about the dark.</p><p>She called again. \u201cCora, are you here?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Rhys would have added his voice to hers, but his throat had gone dry. His jaw seemed locked in place.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d she finally said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d The word creaked from his throat. He coughed and tried to master the emotions rising in his gorge. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that she\u2019s not here. We only know she hasn\u2019t answered the call. She could be hurt, or asleep. We have to check the whole cellar, every corner.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a moment. Then finally said, \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Sweeping his light around, Rhys noticed a great many crates and casks filling the room. Odd. He would have expected to find it stone-empty, especially after all this time. Looted by the locals long ago. Perhaps the rumors of ghosts had kept them away.</p><p>He knew they\u2019d descended to the bottom of the staircase when his final footfall hit the ground with a thud that shivered his hipbone. He stumbled over something that felt like a wire.</p><p>\u201cCora?\u201d Meredith called. Her voice was a bright, clear beacon in the blackness. \u201cCora, are you in here?\u201d</p><p>No answer from the girl.</p><p>There was, however, an answer from God ... in the form of a low, menacing groan at the top of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>There was a crash of thunder. A crash of stone.</p><p>And then a chorus of a hundred small collisions, each one bashing blindly into the next.</p><p>The difference was palpable, instantly. It had nothing to do with the lighting\u2014pitch black was pitch black\u2014but rather to do with the air. The cool, misty breeze was instantly sucked from the space, replaced with puffs of grit, and rank, ancient damp. The air was choked with earth and secrets, as if they\u2019d been sealed in a tomb.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d said Meredith, \u201cthat sound wasn\u2019t what I think it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cWe\u2019re trapped.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tightened around his.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he said.</p><p>At the same moment, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine, you know.\u201d</p><p>And after speaking over one another, they laughed a bit together. Fitting, that each of them should think of comforting the other. They were each of them so accustomed to being the stronger in any given pair.</p><p>Once the last bits of their echoed laughter had seeped into the cracks of the stones, Rhys took the lamp from her hand and held it aloft between them. Bravery aside, she was trembling a bit.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be concerned. You\u2019re with me. And I\u2019m indestructible, remember?\u201d It was this very place that had made him so. There was no way in hell he\u2019d die here. Clearing his throat, he went on, \u201cWe need to look for something dry and wood. Something that will burn.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you mean to start a fire? It\u2019s not that cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but this lamp won\u2019t last all night. And once we have a bit more light, I\u2019ll go up and assess the damage.\u201d From the quality of the air, Rhys suspected the cave-in was complete, but he would check it himself to be certain.</p><p>Keeping her hand in his, he scouted the immediate area for wood. As his luck would have it, he stumbled into a crate almost instantly. He bent and began prying the boards apart with his bare hands. It was rough going. For a crate stored for more than a decade in a damp, underground room, the wood was surprisingly strong and dry.</p> <p>Once he had the top of the crate pried off, Rhys waved the lamp over it to see what was inside. Brushing aside a thick layer of straw\u2014again, remarkably fresh and dry\u2014he uncovered several rows of bottles. Strange, that his father would have left this much of any spirit lying about, untouched.</p><p>Curling his fingers around a bottleneck, he lifted it to the torchlight. French brandy. And, judging by the rich amber color that swirled red in the flickering light, it was brandy of a fine quality.</p><p>Well, that sealed it. This hadn\u2019t belonged to his father. The old man had always valued quantity over quality.</p><p>\u201cAt least we won\u2019t die of thirst,\u201d Meredith said, taking the bottle from his hand. \u201cI\u2019d wager he has some foodstuffs stored in here, too. I thought he mentioned a crate of olives, some weeks ago. Or was it dates? And I know he was very proud of seizing some silver flatware recently. We could make a right fine meal down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMyles,\u201d Rhys breathed. \u201cThis all belongs to Gideon Myles. He\u2019s been storing his smuggled goods here?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cAmongst his associates, he specializes in the hard-to-place items. When they can\u2019t find a buyer immediately, or none who\u2019ll pay what the goods are worth ... he brings the goods up here and stores them until he can find a market for them in one of the cities. Some things stay just a week. Others, months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tripwire. The bastard had this place rigged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t lightning that caused that cave-in. I thought I\u2019d stumbled over a cord, just before. It must have triggered a powder explosion somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well. That makes sense. Gideon is very protective of his goods.\u201d</p><p>Rhys held the lamp aloft and blinked until the smoke stung his eyes, straining to make out more of the cavernous room. It was full to bursting with crates, casks ... even furniture and rolled carpets.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the real reason no one wants me to rebuild Nethermoor Hall. You\u2019re all living high off this trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot living high. Surviving, just barely. Gideon has had to take a great many risks. Harold, Laurence, Skinner ... they all work for him as lookouts, and they help him transport and unload his cargo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you hire out the ponies to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd accept some of the goods in trade?\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cYes, some. Stores for the inn.\u201d</p><p>He swore softly. What else could he say? The entire village of Buckleigh-in-the-Moor, including his intended bride, was complicit in a vast smuggling ring. He\u2019d known Myles was dealing in unlevied goods, but he\u2019d never dreamed of an operation of this magnitude. Truly, he wouldn\u2019t have believed the knave capable of it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of, Rhys. I know it\u2019s unlawful, and I know it\u2019s dangerous. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been so determined to build up the inn and draw travelers to the district. If I\u2019m ever going to convince Gideon to disentangle himself from this ... this trade, the village needs another source of income to replace it.\u201d</p> <p>Rhys\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cAnd the patronage of a new Lord Ashworth won\u2019t serve that purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She sighed noisily. \u201cNot indefinitely. You\u2019ve said yourself, you don\u2019t even intend to produce an heir. You know I\u2019m barren. Unless you mean to marry another lady, but I don\u2019t know how you\u2019d convince her to come live in this place.\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how you can stand to live in this place. I know what you went through here, Rhys. I grew up watching it. I saw every bruise, every welt\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shoved the lamp into her hand and bent to pry a board off the crate. \u201cI need to make a fire.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t talk about this now. He\u2019d rather not talk about it, ever.</p><p>\u201cRhys\u2014\u201d</p><p>Crack. He braced a board between his hand and the ground, then broke it in two with his boot. After throwing the splintered pieces into a pile, he wrenched another plank free and prepared to repeat the process. \u201cLook at the smoke,\u201d he told her, determined to change the subject.</p><p>Her eyes went to the swirl of black soot coiling away from the lamp, rising into the air.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s drawing upward,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means there\u2019s ventilation someplace. A crack\u2014either in the caved-in entrance, or above us somewhere. Once daylight comes, I\u2019ll be able to make us a way out of here. We just have to wait for dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd pray for poor Cora.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGather some straw for tinder,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve a screw for uncorking that brandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t a screw. But I have my ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain you do.\u201d If he was going to spend a night in this hole, at the least he was going to do so while warm to the marrow and drunk out of his skull.</p><p>They cleared a small depression in the ground to use as a firepit. Rhys arranged the broken planks, propping them against one another, and Meredith stuffed the gaps with straw. Then she cracked the top off a bottle of brandy with a stone and dashed a liberal amount of spirits over the kindling. One spark from the lamp, and ...</p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>They had a fire.</p><p>For a moment, the flames blazed so high, so bright, that Rhys stood frozen, accosted by memories of the last time Nethermoor had seen roaring flames. His heart kicked into a gallop, and sweat broke out on his brow. But the brandy quickly flamed out, and the fire settled down to a small, respectable, unthreatening size. One might have called it cozy. Even romantic.</p><p>Adding to the effect, Meredith unrolled a fantastically expensive-looking Afghan carpet and arranged it alongside the fire. \u201cOh look,\u201d she said, prying open a newly revealed trunk. \u201cFurs.\u201d A pile of sable and ermine soon graced the carpet\u2019s geometric design.</p><p>Good God. A small fortune was stored in this cellar.</p><p>While she dug about for cups, Rhys took the dying lamp and went to inspect the entrance. As he\u2019d suspected, rocks had shifted and fallen, covering the opening completely. They might be movable, if he could wedge a board or bar in just the right place. But until he had some daylight shining through, he\u2019d have little way of knowing whether his efforts were making matters better or worse.</p><p>When he scrambled back down to the cellar floor, he found Meredith brushing the packing straw from a silver tea service. Lifting her skirt, she reached beneath for a fold of clean petticoat to wipe the cups clean.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d she said, pouring brandy into a teacup and holding it out to him. \u201cIs it hopeless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But it\u2019s not worth trying to dig our way out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come be comfortable, and save your strength for the morning.\u201d</p><p>They nestled into the furs side by side, but not embracing. A long, empty night together stretched out before them. It didn\u2019t seem possible to him that they\u2019d get through it without having a certain conversation, so he decided to confront it head-on.</p><p>\u201cSo what is it, then? Your answer.\u201d In the ensuing silence, he took an anxious, overlarge swallow of his brandy. It burned all the way down.</p><p>She drank, too. Finally she whispered, \u201cI\u2019m still not sure.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he quietly swore. This time, he tossed back an even larger draught of brandy. Because he knew it would burn, and he welcomed it.</p><p>\u201cAre you angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I be angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have every reason in the world to be angry, Rhys. I don\u2019t know how you can even sit in this place and remain so calm.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t too sure himself. Brandy had something to do with it. He took another drink, then let his head roll back against the clammy surface of the wall.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTalk about what? Marriage, or lack thereof? I think we\u2019ve talked that out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot marriage. About ... the past. About this place.\u201d</p><p>He kept quiet, hoping she would be clever enough to take his silence as a sign that no, he did not want to talk about it.</p><p>\u201cI know he beat you here.\u201d</p><p>He tensed his jaw, to keep from growling at her to shut hers. She hadn\u2019t accepted him. She didn\u2019t have the right to keep poking at his wounds, tracing his scars ...</p><p>\u201cEveryone in service at Nethermoor knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis pit is soundproof,\u201d he bit out. \u201cNo one knew what went on down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose no one did know, not precisely. But it was impossible not to notice the evidence after the fact. And what do you think he did when you went off to school? Do you suppose he gave up violence for the winter term?\u201d</p><p>A hot coal lodged in his chest. He could barely manage to form the words. \u201cDid he hit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, not me.\u201d</p><p>A drop of sweat rolled from his brow to his ear. Thank God. If he found out his father had hurt Meredith, Rhys truly would have lost control.</p><p>\u201cMy father was very careful,\u201d she said. \u201cHe never let me run about the Hall, never would have allowed me to work for the man. But there were others who didn\u2019t have a father looking out for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then there was me, whose father was the problem. No escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened. Just have out with it, and you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p><p>He sincerely doubted that. But they were here all night, and he could tell she wasn\u2019t going to let the matter rest. Fine, then. He\u2019d have out with it, and then he\u2019d drink himself into oblivion. And when he woke in the morning and crawled out of this hole, he would leave this place behind. Forever.</p><p>He cleared his throat and prepared a dispassionate tone. \u201cThe month after my mother died, my father brought me down into this pit. He told me to stand in the empty center. He melted back into the shadows. And then a fist came out of the darkness. Sent me sprawling to the ground. I was stunned. It took me a minute to realize he\u2019d hit me. I thought it had to have been an accident. He told me to get up, and so I got up. And then he hit me again, harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Get up,\u2019 he\u2019d say. \u2018Stand, you miserable wretch.\u2019 And so I would struggle to my feet. Only to be hit again. And again, until I couldn\u2019t stand at all. We played that amusing little father-son game a few times a week, for the remainder of my childhood. Me standing just about there\u201d\u2014he pointed toward the dark center of the room\u2014\u201cand him beating me until I could no longer stand. Took longer every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, why didn\u2019t you just stay down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. And he truly didn\u2019t. That would have been the clever thing, he supposed\u2014to feign defeat. But he\u2019d been nine years old, and the old man was his only parent left alive. It simply hadn\u2019t crossed his mind to disobey. His father said, \u201cstand\u201d\u2014he stood. He stood and took another blow. It seemed to make the old man oddly happy. What else does a son long to do, but make his father happy?</p><p>And after so many years, it was as though that voice had become a part of him. In every brawl, in every battle. Whenever he took a blow or a musket ball and crumpled to the ground, he heard that harsh, brutal command echoing in his head. Up. Up, you filth. On your feet. Stand and take another. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So he always got up. No matter how desperately he\u2019d wished to slip over into the next world and leave this one behind, that voice would never let him stay down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why he did it. And he\u2019s dead now, so I never will. Maybe he\u2019d been beating my mother and needed a substitute. Maybe he took some perverse thrill from it. Sometimes I think ... he just wanted to make me strong. Stronger than he felt, in his own life. Indestructible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for me not to touch you right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he snapped in reflex. \u201cI mean ... I\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou have every right to be angry. I\u2019ve been angry with that bastard for nearly two decades now. When word reached us of his death, I wanted to take the next boat to Ireland just to spit on his grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry.\u201d But even as he said it, his speech grew clipped. \u201cJust what is it you want from this conversation? Are you trying to convince me that my father was a sick bastard? Because I already know that, Merry. Or is this little talk supposed to make me feel better? Should it warm my heart to know that you and your father and every last footman and chambermaid were all perfectly aware that I was being beaten within an inch of my life, and yet stood by and did nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, inching closer. \u201cNo, of course not. That\u2019s exactly why you should be angry. Not just angry at him, but at this whole place. We all failed you, Rhys. You don\u2019t owe this village anything.\u201d Her leg grazed his thigh, and he flinched. \u201cYou\u2019re holding so much emotion inside. I can feel it coming off you in waves. Just let it out.\u201d</p><p>What he let out was a long, steadying breath. \u201cThe man is dead,\u201d he said after a time. \u201cIf I get angry, I\u2019ll just end up taking it out elsewhere. Hurting someone or something that doesn\u2019t deserve it. And it won\u2019t change a damned thing.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cIn the end, I\u2019m alive, despite his every attempt to kill me and my every attempt to die. Things happen the way they\u2019re meant to happen.\u201d</p> <p>She growled. \u201cI am so bloody sick of hearing you talk like that. You were not delivered to this place and time by the hand of destiny, Rhys. You survived, despite everything, by your own strength and wits and courage. I know it, because I\u2019m a survivor too. And it\u2019s so frustrating, to hear you go on about fate and destiny and \u2018meant to be,\u2019 when I\u2019ve been holding that village together with hard work and sacrifice for years. I stayed when others left. I kept working when others had given up. For God\u2019s sake, I married a man older than my own father. Don\u2019t tell me it was all for nothing, and that my life would have turned out just the same no matter what. You insult me when you speak that way. You insult yourself. You\u2019ve stayed alive, and not because fate preserved you, but because you\u2019re a strong, courageous, quick-witted, resilient, good-hearted man. And it cuts me deep, every time I hear you deny it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to say to that. He rose to stretch and add wood to the fire.</p><p>\u201cMore brandy?\u201d she asked him, once he was seated again.</p><p>He accepted wordlessly.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve come up with the story. For Darryl to tell, about the pool. Do you want to hear it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t, especially. But evidently she took his silence as a yes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like the one you told me in Bath. Darryl will have his own way with it, but I think it should go something like this.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cOnce, back in the ancient times, when the moors were covered with forests and those forests were thick with magic, there was a small village where Buckleigh-in-the-Moor now stands. The village was plagued nightly by a bloodthirsty wolf. As they slept, the wolf would drag away their weak, their elderly, their children, and devour them. The people were helpless to defend themselves. Then one day a champion came. A strong man, and a good man, charged with protecting the villagers from harm. Every night, the champion would wage an epic battle with the wolf, incurring bites and gashes in his struggle to protect the town. In the morning, once the wolf had returned to its den, he would go to a sacred pool to cleanse his wounds and be healed.</p><p>\u201cAnd there was a young girl. A very curious, often lonely girl. She would follow him in secret every morning, watching as he bathed in the pool, washing away the blood and allowing his wounded body to heal. To her, the champion was the most beautiful man she\u2019d ever beheld, and the bravest. She fell in love with him, though he never noticed her. And the more her love grew, the more it pained her each morning to see the marks the wolf had wrought. Each day his wounds were deeper, more damaging, as the wolf grew more savage with hunger.</p><p>\u201cOne night, she stayed awake in secret and crept out of her cottage to watch the battle between man and beast. The champion fought with great skill and much heart, but this night the wolf\u2019s teeth were keen with desperation. As the girl looked on in horror, the wolf knocked the champion to the ground and stood over his senseless body, preparing to seize him by the throat in his savage, spittle-flecked jaws. The girl drew an arrow and fitted it to her bow. Just as the wolf reared to pounce, she shot a flaming arrow straight through the beast\u2019s heart, killing it instantly.\u201d</p><p>She stopped. \u201cHm. I suppose we\u2019ll need an explanation as to how this girl became such a skilled archer. And why she never killed the wolf on her own before, if so. More brandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>One last trickle into her own glass emptied the bottle, and she let it roll into the shadows. \u201cAt any rate, the girl pulled the wounded champion to the sacred pool, and doused him with cool water until all his wounds were healed. And just as he began to open his eyes, she slipped away to hide, afraid to shame him in his nakedness. The villagers, having found the dead wolf, all came running and rejoicing. \u2018All is well,\u2019 they cried. \u2018The wolf is vanquished, and the village is saved.\u2019 They cheered and feted the baffled champion, and he bid them farewell. His work there was done. He went on to fight other, even braver battles in defense of other innocents. The girl never saw him again. But she waited there by the pool, quietly hoping he\u2019d one day return, ever faithful to her love.\u201d</p><p>Meredith drained her brandy. \u201cShe should turn into a rock or a flower or a tree, or something else we can point to now. That\u2019s the way these stories go, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re asking me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you? I thought I\u2019d made it rather obvious.\u201d</p><p>Rhys rubbed his temples. He had a roaring headache from the brandy already, and he was tired of stories and games. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m not as clever as you give me credit for. Stop speaking in riddles, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI followed you, Rhys. When I was a girl, I followed you everywhere, whenever I could slip away. And not only to the pool. Whenever you came to the stables, I would hide and watch you. If you took out your horse, I would follow on foot for as long as I could. When I couldn\u2019t keep up, I\u2019d return to the stables and wait until you came home from your ride, just to catch one more glimpse of you as you handed the reins to a groom.\u201d She laughed a little. \u201cGod, the hours I spent in that hayloft, peering down. I perpetually had straw caught in my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so I was there that night. The night of the fire. I was waiting for you to come home. I watched you fight him. You didn\u2019t overturn that lantern, Rhys. I threw it. Threw it at him, but I missed the bastard. He\u2019d thrown down the whip and reached for the hayfork, and\u2014\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cI will never forget the look on that man\u2019s face ... It was pure evil. He would have killed you.\u201d</p><p>Rhys choked back a wave of bile. \u201cYou should have let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter me than ...\u201d Damn it, he should have died that night. Somehow he knew in his soul he was supposed to have died that night. And because of her, he\u2019d spent fourteen years stumbling through the world half-alive, looking in vain for an entrance to hell. All for nothing. Nothing.</p><p>Irrational rage welled within him. He clenched his hand into a fist. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Meredith. You are a stable master\u2019s daughter. You threw a burning lamp in a horse barn? You should have known better.\u201d</p><p>She buried her face in her hands. \u201cI did know, I do know. But I wasn\u2019t even thinking. I just needed to stop him, and it was the closest object to hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll those horses ... Jesus. They died horrible deaths. Did you hear them screaming? Did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her voice grew very small.</p><p>\u201cLucky for you. I still hear them.\u201d Even now. Even now, in this dark, dank hell, he could hear those screams echoing through his skull. He put his hands to his ears, but it didn\u2019t help, because the memories resided between them.</p><p>\u201cI ran to raise the alarm,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then my father forced me to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father was maimed. I know it. I know it well. I\u2019m the one who has bandaged and bathed and dressed and tended him all the days since. And it may be horrible of me to say, but I would do it again. That man would have killed you. No matter what the consequences, I can\u2019t be sorry for having stopped him.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head to his knees, feeling ill.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know why?\u201d She put a hand to his shoulder.</p><p>He shrugged off her touch. \u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t want to hear any more. My head is killing me. Just leave me be.\u201d</p><p>He had an awful, sinking suspicion he knew what she would say next. And he didn\u2019t want to hear it. He didn\u2019t want that precious gift mixed up with all this anger and pain.</p><p>\u201cBecause I loved you.\u201d</p><p>Damn, there it was.</p><p>Her voice shook. \u201cI have loved you for as long as I can remember, ever since I was a girl. I loved you all those years you were away. I read every page of every newspaper I could find, scouring the print for word of you. I dreamed of you at night. I went to bed with other men, wishing they were you. And I will likely love you until the day I die, because if I could have stopped loving you, I would have found a way to do so by now.\u201d She inhaled deeply, then released the breath in a rush. \u201cThere. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>Meredith waited in the flickering dark, afraid to say more. Afraid to move, or blink, or breathe. There it was, the truth she\u2019d been hiding inside herself for decades now. Hiding so deeply, she\u2019d even been able to deny it to herself. Not any longer. The longer he went without reacting, the more anxious she became. Fear gnawed at her insides, working its way from the pit of her belly all the way to her limbs. Eroding her chin and fingers and knees from the inside, so that they trembled.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Rhys,\u201d she said again. Because what was one more time, after all? She laid her trembling fingers against his wrist. \u201cRhys? Please. Say something.\u201d</p><p>And after a long, excruciating moment, he spoke exactly one word.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Not what she\u2019d been hoping for, but somehow unarguably fitting.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he said again, louder this time. The curse echoed through the dark. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Until yesterday, I had no idea you\u2019d been blaming yourself all this time. I imagined you thought the fire was an accident. Because it was. It was a stupid, tragic accident.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head. \u201cHow could you keep that from me? Can you have any idea what difference it would have made, if I\u2019d known that all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I threw the lantern? Or that I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. Can you possibly imagine\u2014\u201d He made a strangled noise in his throat. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, my whole damned wasted life ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. So sorry. I wish I could have told you sooner, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what, Meredith? You could have told me sooner. You could have told me weeks ago. At least the latter bit.\u201d</p><p>Her heart squeezed. Scrambling to her knees, she turned to him and wrapped her arms about his shoulders. She simply had to hold him. \u201cI\u2019m telling you now, Rhys. I love you.\u201d</p> <p>His muscles went rigid. \u201cI said, don\u2019t touch me. Not in this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I understand.\u201d Reluctantly, she let her arms slide from his shoulders and settled back on the floor. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? You don\u2019t owe this village anything. You don\u2019t owe me anything. But you owe it to yourself, after all this time and all this pain, to find your own happiness. If you could find true contentment here, I\u2019d want nothing more than to share it with you. But if not ...\u201d Despite her quivering lips, she willed her voice to be strong. \u201cThen you should go.\u201d</p><p>He sat in silence. His breath came so quick, she could feel the cellar\u2019s humidity increasing by the second. Brushing the dust from his trousers, he rose to his feet and tossed a plank on the fire before wiping clean another bottle of brandy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to talk about this?\u201d</p><p>Crash. The bottleneck broke against a stone. \u201cTalk about what?\u201d he asked tightly, sloshing brandy into his cup.</p> <p>\u201cYou. Us. The past. The future.\u201d Could he forgive her, or couldn\u2019t he?</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, only drank.</p><p>She forced herself to be patient. After all she\u2019d told him tonight ... about the fire, about her feelings ... she\u2019d altered everything he knew about himself, his past. And everything he knew about her. He must be overwhelmed, just struggling to make sense of it all. And to make it all worse, they were trapped in this place where he\u2019d endured so much pain. Perhaps conversation was beyond him at the moment. For God\u2019s sake, she was surprised that standing wasn\u2019t beyond him at the moment.</p><p>It certainly didn\u2019t come easy to her. Using a nearby crate for support, she rose to her feet on wobbly legs.</p><p>\u201cI know you must be upset,\u201d she said carefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not upset.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re upset.\u201d How could he keep denying the obvious? \u201cYou\u2019re angry as hell. It\u2019s natural, Rhys. It\u2019s all right to show it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be angry?\u201d He sliced the air with his hand, and brandy splashed from his cup. A few drops landed on Meredith\u2019s arm. Others spattered and sparked in the fire. His emotions, by contrast, remained at a quiet smolder. \u201cThe fire wasn\u2019t my fault. You say you love me, always have. The last fourteen years of torment were all just a big mistake. I should be happy, shouldn\u2019t I? Goddamned ecstatic. Stop telling me I\u2019m angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. You\u2019re not angry.\u201d</p><p>A tense silence followed.</p><p>\u201cJust what are you expecting?\u201d he finally asked. His voice was flat. \u201cTell me what reaction you\u2019re waiting to see. Am I supposed to fly into a rage and smash crates against the wall? Lay my head in your lap and weep while you croon sweet words and stroke my hair? Or ... or I know. You\u2019re hoping I\u2019ll push up your skirts and pump you like an animal all night long. Because somehow a few hours of rutting will erase decades of living hell.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re good, Merry. But not that good.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to let his words hurt her. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not expecting any hysterics, nor any ... rutting. But I\u2019ve given you a great deal to absorb, and this place would make anyone feel a bit crazed.\u201d She reached out to lay a hand on his arm, striving for a soothing touch. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it through this. Come sit with me and wait out the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, don\u2019t touch me.\u201d He whipped his arm from her grasp and took a lunging step back. He leveled a finger at her. \u201cI mean it, Merry. Stay away from me right now. I don\u2019t trust myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Tears burned in her eyes as she slid back to the pile of furs. \u201cAll right. I won\u2019t bother you further.\u201d</p> <p>She lay down on her side, hugging herself against the cold. He slunk to the opposite side of the fire and crouched there, leaning his back against a barrel and stacking his arms on his knees.</p><p>From this vantage, the flames and smoke appeared to dance around his face, distorting his features. His hands were clenched tight into fists. He was so tense, she could feel him vibrating with the force of his repressed fury.</p><p>He was fighting, she could sense it. Quietly doing battle over there in the corner. With himself, with his demons, with her. Maybe just with the rage itself ... she couldn\u2019t be sure. All she knew was that he wouldn\u2019t let her help. He wouldn\u2019t even let her near.</p><p>She must have slept eventually, for the next thing she knew was the sound of rock grinding against rock.</p><p>She shivered. The fire had gone out, and the furs had fallen away from her sleeping form. Her knees curled up to her chest, and she wrapped her arms about them, trying to warm herself.</p><p>After a moment spent blinking at the gooseflesh on her arms, a realization dawned. Or rather, dawn itself was her realization. The fire had gone out, but there was light enough to make out her surroundings. It had to be daylight. Weak, dusty daylight, but daylight just the same. The entire cavern was illuminated.</p><p>Rhys was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>\u201cRhys? Are you here?\u201d</p><p>She struggled to rise from the carpet. Surely no matter how angry Rhys was, he wouldn\u2019t have left her here all alone. Would he?</p><p>\u201cRhys?\u201d</p><p>Her call echoed through the cellar, unanswered. Meredith\u2019s heart began to race. Her skirts had tangled about her legs, and she tried to shake them out as she came to a sitting position.</p><p>Then, from the stairway, she heard a low, masculine grunt of effort.</p><p>Followed by a mighty crash.</p><p>\u201cRhys!\u201d</p><p>Dust choked the air, but she clawed her way through it to reach the staircase. As the clouds of grit settled, she saw him silhouetted in the newly cleared entryway, hunched as he prepared to roll back one final stone. Wedging a length of iron beneath the boulder, he pried and heaved with all his strength. Certainly, they could have scrambled over the rock the way it was. The opening was already large enough. But she didn\u2019t interrupt. He was clever enough to have realized the same. For whatever reason, it was important to him to clear the entire way.</p><p>With one last straining effort, he managed to rock the boulder onto its narrow end. A final shove with his boot, and the thing rolled clear.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, wiping the perspiration from his brow. His knuckles were skinned and bloodied. \u201cI\u2019m done with this place.\u201d</p><p>His words had the edge of finality. She wondered what they meant. Was he done with this horrible cellar? Or with Nethermoor completely?</p><p>What about her? Was he done with her?</p><p>They descended back to the village, trudging along in silence. He seemed disinclined to converse, to put it mildly, so Meredith gratefully dropped a few steps behind. She ached all over. Her muscles complained about their night spent on cold, rocky ground, her head pounded, and her stomach demanded food. Worst of all was the wrenching pain in her chest.</p><p>The pain eased considerably when they entered the tavern of the Three Hounds to find the room filled to bursting with people.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re back!\u201d Darryl called out over the room. \u201cMrs. Maddox and his lordship, they\u2019ve returned!\u201d</p><p>Stumbling his way through the cheering crowd, her father carved a path to her and all but fell into her arms. \u201cMerry,\u201d he rasped, drawing her into a tight embrace and stroking her hair. \u201cI was so concerned. I mean, I knew you were with Rhys and he\u2019d look out for you, but still ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well, Father.\u201d She hugged him in return. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to have worried you. Is everyone else returned?\u201d Craning her neck, she looked over his shoulder into the crowd. So many people\u2014every resident of the village, it seemed\u2014but no sign of the one person she sought.</p><p>Until she spied a basket of fresh yeast rolls, and her breath caught in her throat. She pulled out of her father\u2019s embrace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Mrs. Maddox.\u201d Cora rushed out from the kitchen, clapping flour from her hands. \u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m back to work. I\u2019m ever so sorry, ma\u2019am. And I don\u2019t know if you can ever forgive me, but I swear I\u2019ll never let\u2014\u201d</p><p>Meredith cut off the girl\u2019s speech by grabbing her into a tight hug. Cora immediately dissolved into tears. Meredith threw a glance of relief in Rhys\u2019s direction, but he\u2019d moved into the crowd. She couldn\u2019t see him anymore.</p><p>She turned her attention back to the sobbing girl in her arms. \u201cPoor dear girl. You had us all so worried.\u201d The layer of dirt and grit she wore mingled with Cora\u2019s dusting of flour. Regardless, Meredith stroked the girl\u2019s hair.</p><p>Cora twisted in her arms. \u201cThe rolls will burn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind it.\u201d She quietly gestured to Darryl, directing him to rescue the bread. Then she directed Cora to the nearest table and helped her into a chair. \u201cWhere were you, dear?\u201d</p><p>Cora bit her lip and turned her eyes to the flagstones. The room went very quiet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened,\u201d Meredith urged. \u201cYou can tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was with me.\u201d A heavy, masculine hand landed on the girl\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Meredith\u2019s gaze swept from hand to arm, from arm to shoulder, and straight up to the face she should have been expecting all along. Damn it, she ought to have known.</p><p>\u201cShe was with me,\u201d Gideon Myles repeated. \u201cAll night.\u201d</p><p>As she glared at him, red waves of anger swam before Meredith\u2019s eyes. She could only manage one word. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeplace private. Someplace safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe only went out for a walk,\u201d Cora said, sniffing earnestly. \u201cBut the mist came up, and Gi ... and Mr. Myles said we ought to wait it out. That it wasn\u2019t safe to go home.\u201d Her grip tightened over Meredith\u2019s hand. \u201cMa\u2019am, I swear to you. It weren\u2019t my intention. We only went out for a walk, and once the mist came up ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t safe to come home. I know.\u201d Meredith swallowed hard and turned to Gideon, confronting his unrepentant gaze. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t safe for you, who\u2019ve called this moor home for more years than this girl\u2019s been alive, to walk home. But it was safe for everyone else in the village to go searching valley, tor, river, and bog for her? Someone could have been killed.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and turned his gaze.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you look away from me.\u201d With a final squeeze, she released Cora\u2019s hands. Trembling with fury, she planted both hands on the tabletop and slowly rose to her feet. \u201cDid you touch her?\u201d</p><p>Cora bent her head to the table and wept.</p><p>Meredith firmed her chin and stared at Gideon until he met her gaze. \u201cI asked you a question. Did you touch her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your business, Meredith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it isn\u2019t.\u201d She kicked the chair out from between them and stepped closer. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything she didn\u2019t want me to do.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even remember reaching back with her hand and letting it fly, she just heard the smart slap of her palm against Gideon\u2019s unshaven face. \u201cYou bastard. She\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a girl, she\u2019s a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you say it. Don\u2019t you call her that.\u201d</p><p>Before she could strike him again, he caught her wrist in a fierce grip. \u201cBelieve me, you have no idea what I was going to say.\u201d Releasing her, he raked her with a look of pure contempt. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s all right for you, but not me? You\u2019re allowed to get tarted up and run away with Ashworth for a week\u2019s worth of high-class fornication, but I\u2019m not allowed to\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gideon never saw it coming. One minute he was standing before Meredith, all but calling her a whore, and the next moment, Rhys had him smashed against the wall. And because it evidently wasn\u2019t enough to do it once, Rhys grabbed him by fistfuls of shirt, pulled him off the wall, and smashed him against it again.</p><p>All around the tavern, bodies launched from chairs and pasted themselves to the edges of the room.</p><p>Holding Gideon pinned to the wall with one arm, Rhys hauled back with the other and swung. At the last second, Gideon managed to twist in his grip, so that the punch glanced off his shoulder and hit the wall\u2014rather than snapping his neck instantaneously. He put a forearm to Rhys\u2019s throat and wedged a boot in the larger man\u2019s gut, levering him away. With his other arm, he reached for the pistol at his side.</p> <p>Rhys beat him to it. \u201cNo guns,\u201d he said, whipping the pistol from Gideon\u2019s waistband and flinging it aside. \u201cJust fists.\u201d</p><p>The pistol skittered across the flagstones, coming to rest at Cora\u2019s feet.</p><p>Gideon gave Rhys a swift kick to the knee\u2014the wounded left knee he always favored. The kick sent Rhys reeling back a pace, giving Gideon an instant to breathe, react.</p><p>Attack.</p><p>Lunging to the side, he grabbed a candlestick from the mantel.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Meredith cried.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s fingers closed around the heavy pipe of brass just as Rhys pulled back for another punch. They both swung at the same time. Rhys\u2019s fist connected with Gideon\u2019s jaw first, altering the angle of the candlestick\u2019s descent, but not its velocity. The club came down on Rhys\u2019s back with a dull thud. Both men roared with pain, separating for a moment.</p><p>But not for long.</p><p>With an inarticulate battle cry, Gideon swung again.</p><p>Rhys dodged, and the candlestick hit a table instead, crunching straight through the tabletop. As Gideon struggled to withdraw the weapon from a bird\u2019s nest of splinters, Rhys picked up a stool and swung it hard. The stool smashed to kindling over Gideon\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d Relinquishing his grip on the candlestick, Gideon lowered his shoulder and charged Rhys with full force.</p> <p>Though Rhys was the larger man, he was caught off-balance. He reeled backward when Gideon struck, and together they plowed the distance of the room, landing against the bar with a crash of glass and splintering wood.</p><p>Meredith\u2019s hands flew to her mouth. Good Lord. They would destroy the whole tavern.</p><p>If Rhys felt a single one of Gideon\u2019s punches to his chest and gut, he didn\u2019t show it. Instead he fisted his hands in Gideon\u2019s shirt and hauled him up and left, swinging him bodily onto the counter and dropping him flat on his back. Within seconds, Rhys had scrambled atop him, straddling Gideon\u2019s thighs to hold him down as he dealt blow after punishing blow.</p><p>\u201cStop this!\u201d Meredith cried. \u201cRhys, Gideon. For the love of God, stop!\u201d</p><p>Neither one of them heeded her pleas.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s hands shot up to grasp Rhys\u2019s throat. He locked his elbows, pushing up until Rhys\u2019s head smashed into the rows of hanging glassware. As they struggled, little bits of glass rained down on them both, followed by red trickles of blood. Whose blood, Meredith couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>Once the shower of glass cleared, the picture looked much the same. Gideon flat on his back on the bar; Rhys looming over him. Gideon\u2019s fingers cinched tight around Rhys\u2019s throat, cutting off his air. Meanwhile, Rhys took jab after powerful jab at Gideon\u2019s ribs. Meredith heard a sick crack.</p><p>Oh, God. This wouldn\u2019t stop until one of them was unconscious. Or dead.</p> <p>Cora leapt toward the men, but Meredith grabbed the girl by the arm and held her back. There was no stopping these two. Anyone who tried to intervene would most certainly be injured, if not killed.</p><p>\u201cDie,\u201d Gideon growled, tightening his fingers about Rhys\u2019s throat.</p><p>In response, Rhys grated out two words. \u201cMake. Me.\u201d</p><p>Rhys\u2019s face had turned a frightening shade of red, but Meredith could tell Gideon\u2019s strength was waning. With an almost regretful expression, Rhys raised his fist and took one last swing at Gideon\u2019s jaw. Blood sprayed from the younger man\u2019s mouth, spattering Meredith and Cora both. Cora shrieked. Gideon\u2019s body went limp, his hands slumping back to the bar.</p><p>A tooth rolled to the floor and bounced off the flagstones.</p><p>And Rhys just kept dealing blows.</p><p>\u201cGet up.\u201d Thwack. \u201cIs that the best you can do?\u201d Thwack. \u201cStand, you miserable piece of filth.\u201d He grabbed the senseless Gideon by the collar and shook him, slamming his head against the bar. \u201cWake up, you bastard, and try to kill me again.\u201d</p><p>He released Gideon\u2019s shirt, and the younger man\u2019s head rolled back to the bar. Rhys sat hulking over him, bleeding and panting and sweating. And maybe\u2014Meredith couldn\u2019t quite tell\u2014weeping a little bit, too.</p><p>Just when she\u2019d gathered the composure to go to him, Rhys firmed his jaw and raised his heavy fist again, as if to deal Gideon a death blow. The room sucked in its breath.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Cora cried.</p><p>Meredith said, \u201cRhys, don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>From behind them both, a man pushed through the crowd and rushed to grab Rhys\u2019s arm. Meredith recognized him as Rhys\u2019s friend and Cora\u2019s sponsor. Mr. Julian Bellamy. She never imagined she\u2019d be so glad to see that man again.</p><p>\u201cSave it,\u201d Bellamy said, breathing hard and using all his strength to rein in Rhys\u2019s fury. \u201cSave that blow for one who deserves it. I\u2019ve found him.\u201d</p><p>After a long, tense moment, Rhys lowered his arm, tugging it out of Bellamy\u2019s grip. He blinked down at Gideon\u2019s insensate form, like he didn\u2019t even recognize the man. His gaze wandered the debris-strewn bar, as if he\u2019d no idea how he\u2019d even come to be there.</p><p>\u201cRhys?\u201d she ventured.</p><p>His eyes lifted to hers, soulless and cold. Swallowing hard, he wiped his brow with his sleeve. The linen came away streaked with dirt and sweat and blood. \u201cYou wanted me angry,\u201d he said, spitting a mouthful of blood to the side. \u201cAre you happy now?\u201d</p><p>She choked on a sob.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re angry. Brilliant. The timing couldn\u2019t be better.\u201d Mr. Bellamy grabbed hold of Rhys\u2019s shirt and pulled, demanding his attention. \u201cSave your wrath. I\u2019ve found him. The man who killed Leo.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>The ensuing silence was profound. Everyone, Meredith included, was struck dumb by the tableau of carnage and destruction. This tavern had seen more than its share of brawls, but never anything like this. No one knew what came next. Breaking the tension, Mr. Bellamy clapped Rhys on the shoulder. \u201cCome along, Ashworth,\u201d he said gently. \u201cLet\u2019s get you out of this place.\u201d</p><p>After a moment\u2019s pause, Rhys nodded. He slid down from the bar, landing with a resounding thud.</p><p>Bellamy surveyed Rhys\u2019s appearance, wrinkling his nose at the blood and dirt. \u201cHave you a fresh suit somewhere?\u201d</p><p>Rhys dabbed his bleeding lip. \u201cUp at my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen up to the house we go.\u201d Bellamy inclined his head in Meredith\u2019s direction. \u201cMrs. Maddox, always a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Meredith nearly hugged the man, she was so grateful. No one here in the village would have been able to stop that scene and talk Rhys back down to earth.</p><p>Bellamy turned an appraising gaze on Cora. \u201cAre you well?\u201d</p><p>The girl nodded.</p><p>\u201cMind you don\u2019t run off again. When we leave, you\u2019ll be coming with us.\u201d</p><p>Meredith tried to catch Rhys\u2019s eye, but he refused to meet her gaze. \u201cRhys,\u201d she said, grabbing his arm. \u201cLook at me. Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I don\u2019t want you to.\u201d He shrugged off her touch. \u201cI can\u2019t be near you right now.\u201d</p><p>As the men left, the hounds trotted after them. Meredith stayed behind. She looked around at the wreckage and wondered to herself, which was in more pieces: her tavern, or her heart?</p><p>Cora rushed to Gideon\u2019s side. Within seconds, he was moaning curses and writhing atop the bar, proving that Rhys hadn\u2019t quite done him in.</p><p>For a long, fuming minute, Meredith contemplated finishing Gideon off herself. Then her practical nature prevailed. She didn\u2019t want that sort of mess in her tavern, or that sort of guilt on her soul. Gideon simply wasn\u2019t worth it. She did, however, want to keep him from bleeding all over the bar. She went for her kit of bandages and medicines, but when she carried the small box out from the kitchen, Cora took it from her hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of him,\u201d she said firmly. There was no girlish lilt in her voice now, only a woman\u2019s resolve. Harold and Laurence stood behind her, rolling up their sleeves. \u201cWe\u2019ll take him up to one of the guest rooms,\u201d she said.</p><p>Meredith nodded numbly. \u201cI\u2019ll clean up down here.\u201d</p><p>After chasing everyone from the room, she latched the door. Alone, she swept up every sliver of broken glass and each piece of splintered wood. She mopped the blood from the countertop and scoured the flagstones with sand. She righted the remaining furniture and returned the brass candlestick to its place on the mantel.</p><p>When noontime came, she went upstairs to wash and change her frock, and then she prepared a simple family meal. Bread, cheese, sausages. She called Father and Darryl in from the horse barn. Mr. Bellamy\u2019s team and carriage were still there, but there was no sign of the gentleman. Or Rhys.</p><p>After the men had taken their meal, Meredith prepared a tray and carried it upstairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought up some tea and broth,\u201d she said, pushing the door open with her foot. \u201cAnd solid food for you, Cora.\u201d</p><p>Gideon was supine on the bed, still wearing his boots and trousers, but stripped to the waist. Cora sat in a chair beside him, holding a poultice to one side of his face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sleeping,\u201d she said. \u201cI dosed him with laudanum for the pain.\u201d</p><p>Meredith set the tray on a nearby table. Then she crossed to stand over Cora\u2019s shoulder and reached to lift the poultice from his face. Lord. The man\u2019s jaw, cheek, and brow were all one giant, swollen bruise. He wouldn\u2019t be seeing daylight through that eye for a week.</p><p>\u201cWell, Gideon,\u201d she said quietly, even though she knew he couldn\u2019t hear, \u201cyou deserved that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t how you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Cora said. She smoothed the hair from Gideon\u2019s brow. \u201cThe two of us, last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so. He\u2019s had this coming to him.\u201d Ever since that night Rhys stumbled in from the moor with a gash in his scalp.</p><p>Meredith took her turn watching over the wounded man while Cora had a rest, then prepared an evening meal. And after all was swept and washed and put away, she sat down at her scratched and dented bar and poured herself a generous glass of wine. Then a second. A folded newspaper lay on the counter. She left it untouched. It couldn\u2019t tell her what she wanted to know today.</p><p>Near midnight, there came a knock at her bedchamber door. Meredith gathered a shawl about her shoulders, went to the door, and slid back the latch to open it a crack.</p><p>Rhys was there, dressed in a clean shirt and breeches. The small cuts on his brow had been tended and cleaned. \u201cI leave at dawn,\u201d he said.</p><p>She could only blink at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the murderer. Bellamy thinks he\u2019s found the man who was with Leo the night he was attacked. Name of Faraday. Been hiding out in Cornwall. Bellamy\u2019s speaking with Cora now. She\u2019ll come along to confirm his identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need to go?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrow quirked. \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? I\u2019m the muscle. In case of reluctance, I\u2019m to pound the truth out of him. Then mete out justice, if it\u2019s warranted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You see. As did everyone else, this morning. It\u2019s what I do.\u201d Self-loathing flickered in his eyes. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse. \u201cWhat about Myles? Will he\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll live. He\u2019s hurting, but he\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>His face stayed grim, but the corners of his mouth softened with relief.</p><p>She added, \u201cHe deserved it, for what he did to Cora.\u201d</p> <p>At the mention of the girl, Rhys winced again. \u201cShe was under my protection. I should never have left her alone.\u201d He cleared his throat and gave himself a little shake. \u201cI\u2019ve unloaded the goods from Bath, packed up my things from the cottage. And I\u2019ve brought back the hounds.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze fell. Two pairs of watery brown eyes looked up at her mournfully. A low whimper sounded from a canine throat.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll miss you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss them.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door wide, and the dogs rushed through, tumbling over one another in their race to the hearth. Even once the hounds settled, she kept the door open in invitation.</p> <p>She allowed her shawl to slip from one shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s hours yet before dawn.\u201d Shameless, she knew. But damn it, what use was pride? If he was leaving forever, she wanted one last night.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d His jaw tensed. \u201cDon\u2019t invite me in. Because it\u2019s not in me to refuse, and I\u2019d only be using you. The same way I used Myles this morning. I am angry as hell, and you\u2019d be just another nameless person to pound. I\u2019d work you hard and fast, until I forget who you are. Who I am.\u201d He swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019d be using you.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord. If he was trying to discourage her, he was going about it all wrong. Meredith clenched her legs together as damp heat surged between her thighs. She\u2019d never been so aroused, so quickly. What he described was exactly what she craved. One last hard, fast, unforgettable time.</p><p>Looking him bravely in the eye, she opened the door wider still. \u201cWe\u2019d be using each other.\u201d</p><p>That was all it took.</p><p>Before she could even catch her breath, he\u2019d moved through the doorway, caught her in his arms, and slammed the door shut, flattening her against it. She was pinned between the hard door of oak at her back and the harder wall of hot muscle before her, and she\u2019d never felt more completely, deliciously trapped.</p> <p>He slid his hands to her hips and lifted her, pressing her against the door. Letting her shawl slide to the floor, she pulled frantically at the hem of her nightdress, hiking it to her midsection so she could wrap her legs around his waist. Linking her ankles, she pulled his pelvis flush with hers. They both moaned as the hard ridge of his erection ground against her bared sex. She was already so wet for him, and he was unbelievably stiff for her. No need for preliminaries.</p><p>He held her up with one powerful arm as he jerked his breeches open with his free hand. With one hard, quick thrust he entered her, slamming her spine against the door. She gasped, and he thrust again, delivering everything he\u2019d promised. A good, hard, nameless pounding into lustful oblivion.</p><p>He bit her shoulder, and she raked his neck with her fingernails. He responded with a growl of crude, unfettered profanity, the likes of which she\u2019d never heard inside a bedchamber. She found it wildly arousing. As the pleasure mounted and coiled in her sex, her limbs went slack. His strength supported her entire body as he drilled her to the door again and again, and she made herself boneless, just trying to stay afloat atop the violent, churning sea of lust.</p><p>\u201cRhys.\u201d She slid her fingers through his cropped hair. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>And then he stopped.</p><p>He froze, deep inside her, panting against the curve of her neck.</p><p>Her hips writhed with need. God, she was so close. Did he mean to torture her?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d he said, gasping for breath.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She cinched her legs about his waist. Her intimate muscles tightened around him, too, and he groaned with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t. Not like this.\u201d He huffed against her neck. \u201cThe damned dogs are chewing my boots.\u201d</p><p>With a gasp, Meredith twisted and craned her neck to see. Sure enough, there the two hounds sat at his feet, nipping at the tassel of his Hessian where it tangled with the hem of her shift.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it. She laughed. And after a moment, he joined her, chuckling low against her neck.</p><p>He lifted his head to meet her gaze. They stayed like that for a moment, joined in body, both breathing hard, laughing with their eyes and speaking without words.</p><p>An unbearable sweetness bloomed in Meredith\u2019s heart, filling her chest and spreading out to her limbs. They\u2019d begun this in a frenzy of anger and desperation, and all it took was one minute of his skin against hers for benign normalcy to prevail. It was just as he\u2019d been saying from the very beginning. Being together just felt so right.</p><p>With trembling hands, she stroked his hair. His eyes shone with affection and vulnerability, and she had a sinking feeling that they looked that way because they were reflecting the unguarded emotion in hers.</p><p>He swallowed hard, and she cupped his face in her palms. \u201cOh, Rhys.\u201d</p><p>I love you, she thought. I am hopelessly in love with you, and you\u2019re leaving me at dawn.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d he said. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Still erect and deeply planted within her, he cupped her backside in his hands and lifted her away from the door. He turned, taking hobbled steps toward the bed, and gently laid her on the mattress without ever withdrawing from her body.</p><p>Easing her backward, he joined her on the bed, boots and all. The hounds, deprived of their amusement, returned to the hearthrug.</p><p>She was under him on the bed, completely surrounded by his strength and protected from the chill. And she\u2019d never felt so afraid, so lonely and cold.</p><p>He tugged at the hem of her shift, pulling it up to her midriff. \u201cTake this off. I want to see you. I need to see you\u2014\u201d</p><p>One last time.</p><p>The unspoken words gave her gooseflesh. But even though she shivered as she did it, she eased the chemise up and drew it over her head, casting it aside. She pulled at his shirt next, as he began to move within her again. Slowly, now. Gently.</p><p>By shifting his weight from one arm to the other, he helped her pull the shirt over his head. They were as bared as they could be without separating, and neither of them was willing to do that.</p><p>Balanced on one elbow, he traced the swell of her breast with his free hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so damned lovely.\u201d His voice was a broken whisper, hoarse with yearning. \u201cSo beautiful.\u201d Flexing his thigh, he slid deep, nudging her womb. \u201cI should have known better than to dream you belonged to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do.\u201d She cupped his cheek. \u201cI am yours. Body, heart, soul. I lo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He kissed her quiet. \u201cI can\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>When he thrust deep again, she lost the breath to speak. She kissed him instead, pressing her lips to his mouth, jaw, throat, ear ... any part of him she could reach.</p><p>He caught her arms and pinned her to the mattress, levering himself up as he stroked home, again and again. She didn\u2019t want this to ever end. Please don\u2019t let this be the last time. She struggled to hold herself back from climax. If he left her unsatisfied, her knowledge of the male mind argued, his pride simply wouldn\u2019t allow him to go.</p><p>But he was too much for her. Too big, too fierce, too tender, too wild. She couldn\u2019t resist him. Never could. He rode her to a bright, gasping peak, then released a savage growl as he took his own pleasure in her.</p><p>When he collapsed, spent and panting atop her, she wrapped her arms around him and held him tight.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d she whispered. Her tongue flickered over the salt of his skin. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d He withdrew from her body, then sat at the edge of the bed, refastening his breeches placket. \u201cI have to see to this business with Faraday. This is what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She rose to a sitting position, gathering the bed linens around her. \u201cNo, this is not what you do.\u201d</p><p>He reached for his shirt. \u201cYou saw me this morning. The whole village saw me this morning. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve spent most of my life, Meredith. Fighting. Brawling. Tearing things apart. I thought I\u2019d finally left all that behind me, but ...\u201d He leveled a hard, unflinching gaze at her. \u201cI would have killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. But Gideon tried to kill you first. That\u2019s not the case with this Faraday person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. From Cora\u2019s account, he could have been an innocent victim, just like your friend Leo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetermining his guilt or innocence isn\u2019t my job.\u201d He gathered white linen in his hands and jammed his head through the neck hole of the shirt. \u201cI\u2019m there to hit first, and Bellamy will ask questions later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that. You won\u2019t do that.\u201d She held his cuff steady as he wrestled his arm into a sleeve. \u201cAll those battles and brawls over the course of your life\u2014they all had one thing in common. They were all fair fights, evenly matched, with opponents who had it coming to them. You\u2019ve never been a bully, Rhys. That\u2019s why I was so taken with you when I was a girl.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cWhen you were a girl, I paid you no notice whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d She smoothed the back of his shirt, draping the crisp linen over his rippling muscles. \u201cDo you know how remarkable that is? Any other youth in your situation would have been looking for a target like me. I was little and awkward and irritating. I would have been so easy to torment. The stable boys, they always teased me when my father wasn\u2019t there. They were so used to being pushed about by their superiors, and they wanted someone to push about, too. It made them feel important, in control. But you\u201d\u2014she stroked his back\u2014\u201cof all young men, you had every reason to make my life miserable, and you never did. You respected my father. You were kind to the grooms. You cherished those horses. And you let me be.\u201d Haltingly, she raised her hand to his hair. \u201cCall it foolish if you will, but ... I loved you for it.\u201d</p><p>With a muttered oath, he braced his elbows on his knees and let his head fall to his hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you believe me? I still love you, Rhys. More than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. And I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d After scrubbing his face with one hand, he propped his chin on his palm. \u201cYou tell me you love me. I know in my mind that should make things better.\u201d He looked up at her. \u201cShouldn\u2019t it? I mean, it\u2019s the one thing I\u2019ve waited my whole life to hear. And now that you\u2019ve whispered those three little words, my anger should disappear, and the hurting should stop, and rainbows should burst through the clouds and a choir of angels should sing.\u201d His eyes glimmered with emotion as his fingertip traced the curve of her jaw. \u201cAgainst all odds, this beautiful, clever, strong woman loves me. My life should be put to rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>Shaking his head, he withdrew his touch. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. You keep saying you love me. And it cuts deeper every blessed time. It hurts, Merry. I can\u2019t understand it, but it hurts like hell. Those words ... they make me want to hit things, lash out in anger.\u201d He swore again, balling his hands into fists. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with me. Too many things are wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m partly to blame. You can\u2019t forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with blame or forgiveness. It\u2019s about brokenness. I can\u2019t risk hurting you.\u201d</p><p>With a gruff sigh, he rose to his feet. \u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>From the bed, she reached out and caught his hand. \u201cStay awhile. It\u2019s not dawn yet. If it\u2019s hard for you, we don\u2019t need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do. Need to talk.\u201d He turned and crouched at the side of the mattress. His eyes were thoughtful as they roamed the knot of their joined hands. \u201cI\u2019ve done some good here, I think. The cottage is your father\u2019s to do with as he pleases. I\u2019ll see that his pension is restored. The men will finish the inn, and you\u2019ll have the posting horses, I promise. And I\u2019ll pay for the damage to the tavern.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not concerned about the inn, you fool man. I\u2019m concerned about you.\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cRhys. Stop acting like this is the end. You can\u2019t do this to me now. What happened to all that talk of destiny? I\u2019m your fate, and you\u2019re mine?\u201d</p><p>After pressing a firm kiss to her knuckles, he rested his brow to their joined hands. \u201cI swear to you. If any woman could make it right, make me whole\u2014it would be you. But I\u2019m just too broken, Merry. It\u2019s too late for me. I wish to God that weren\u2019t the case, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He wiped a tear from her cheek. \u201cSome things just aren\u2019t meant to be.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>\u201cI thought your home county was forbidding,\u201d Bellamy said, squinting at the coach\u2019s small window. \u201cThis makes it seem right cheery in comparison. Is it just coincidence, Ashworth, or does a depressing fog actually follow you around?\u201d Rhys didn\u2019t answer. Forget the fog. He felt like a damned thundercloud rumbled within his chest. His heart seethed with thick, churning, violent emotion. Hurt, confusion, anger. And though he\u2019d only left her a half day ago, he missed Meredith so much he could scarcely breathe. But he had to put distance between them. He couldn\u2019t let her get caught in the storm.</p><p>Absently, he worked his tongue against a cut inside his upper lip. The tang of blood helped him focus. The coppery taste coaxed a strange feeling in him, one vaguely akin to nostalgia. Just as that fisticuffs with Myles yesterday had given him a clarity of sorts. The dealing and taking of blows\u2014this was what he did, what he knew so very well. He\u2019d been raised to it, after all. It was the family trade.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Faraday. Is he big?\u201d Rhys hoped so. He didn\u2019t like pounding on small ones.</p> <p>Bellamy shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s much like me, as Cora remarked.\u201d</p><p>Arching a brow, Rhys studied his companion with fresh interest. With an uneasy glance, Bellamy made a defensive shift down the seat.</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019ll do,\u201d Rhys said.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Bellamy tugged at his cuff. \u201cIt should have occurred to me months ago. At first, I thought Morland had arranged the murder. He wanted the Stud Club tokens, and he was there in the card room the night Leo and I made plans to attend the boxing match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Morland had nothing to do with it.\u201d Rhys frowned. He thought they\u2019d put this argument to rest in Gloucestershire.</p><p>\u201cI know that now. And that\u2019s when I realized, for every token Morland collected, somewhere there was an angry former member of the Club. So I went through them all, making inquiries as to their whereabouts the night of the murder. I missed Faraday at first, because everyone seemed to think he\u2019d left Town days earlier. Even his house staff confirmed it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut he hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And he knew about the boxing match. It was Faraday\u2019s token Morland won that night. We were all watching them play. After Faraday lost, Leo\u2014sporting fellow that he was\u2014pumped Morland\u2019s hand, congratulated him on a game well-played. Faraday masked it well, but I could tell he was furious. When he announced his intent to head for the country immediately, we assumed he was out of funds. Never thought to question it. Finally, on my third round of inquiries, one of the footmen spilled the truth. Peter Faraday hadn\u2019t left Town until two days after Leo\u2019s death.\u201d He swore. \u201cHe has to be the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope Cora can identify him with certainty.\u201d</p><p>The girl lay reclined on the front-facing seat, sleeping heavily. At least, Rhys thought it safe to assume she was asleep, because he didn\u2019t know any woman who would willingly display herself in front of two gentlemen with her mouth agape. This actual slumber came after she\u2019d merely pretended to doze her way out of Devonshire and across Bodmin Moor. Her eyes hadn\u2019t met his since they\u2019d left the Three Hounds. She was back to being afraid of him, and Rhys couldn\u2019t say he blamed her one bit.</p><p>The whole village would fear him again. He\u2019d never forget looking up from Gideon Myles\u2019s bleeding face to find the bar destroyed and the assembled residents of Buckleigh-in-the-Moor staring at him in collective horror. And there, in the center of them all, his lovely Meredith ... her face bleached to the shade of bone, and spattered with blood. Just the memory was enough to make his stomach turn and his head throb with pain. In all his wretched life, he\u2019d never felt more monstrous.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the sun,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>Leaning across him, Rhys peeked out the window. Cornwall was a lonesome place, but like Devonshire, it had a stark beauty. As they rounded a bend, the fog lifted. He glimpsed long, green fingers of earth grasping at a brilliant blue sea. The coves between them were dark, honeycombed cliffs. There was a sense of wobbling along the edge of the world as their coach and team navigated the coastal road, high above the breaking waves.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of place are we looking for?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to my source, the house is perched above a rocky cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas your source any more specific? There seem to be a great many rocky coves hereabouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll know it when we come to it,\u201d Bellamy said with confidence. \u201cLast time we stopped, that crofter told me it\u2019s the only house of any size for miles.\u201d</p><p>The carriage tilted around another steep curve, and Rhys grabbed the edge of the seat to keep from sliding into Bellamy\u2019s lap. That wouldn\u2019t go over well.</p><p>\u201cTell me something,\u201d he said after a minute. \u201cYou believe this Peter Faraday took Leo into an alleyway knowing they would be attacked? That he meant to lure Leo to his death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy grit his teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re on this little journey, isn\u2019t it? To find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if your theory is true ...\u201d Rhys peered out at the road. \u201cHow do you know we\u2019re not being lured into an ambush ourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d He tapped a finger against the window glass. \u201cWe\u2019ll be on our guard.\u201d</p><p>A house came into view, emerging from the mist as though it floated on its own low-hovering cloud. It was a small stone and brick affair, eccentrically designed. The window shutters\u2019 paint had peeled away from the wood. No lights emanated from within, and no smoke puffed from the chimney.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look especially welcoming, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rhys agreed. Neither did it look especially occupied. \u201cPerhaps your sources were misinformed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just look at it. It\u2019s the perfect place to hide.\u201d He shook Cora awake. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to wake up now. Ashworth and I will go inside. You\u2019ll stay here. If we don\u2019t come out for you within a half hour, you\u2019re to tell the coachman to drive you straight back.\u201d</p><p>Blinking, Cora rose to a sitting position. After a lazy stretch, she peered out the window, just as they were drawing up to the house.</p><p>\u201cLa!\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that just the picture of a fright. I\u2019m not staying in the coach alone. I want to come in with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll meet with inside,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cThere may be danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was here to identify the man. How can I do that from here? I tell you, I\u2019m not staying in this coach.\u201d</p><p>As the carriage rolled to a halt, Bellamy leaned forward. \u201cWhat will you do? Run off into the fog again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t run off into the fog. I do know better than that, it\u2019s just what everyone assumed.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m used to being thought stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather be thought a whore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a whore! Not any longer. I never took a penny from Mr. Myles. It wasn\u2019t at all like you\u2019re thinking.\u201d She cast a brief, fearful look at Rhys. \u201cOr what you supposed, my lord. Gideon was very kind to me. We have a great deal in common, it seems. We talked all night. Mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, mostly,\u201d Bellamy echoed. \u201cAnd now I suppose you\u2019re in love with this criminal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I were?\u201d Cora said. \u201cI don\u2019t see that it\u2019s any of your affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you were so in love with Leo after an hour in his company, then stripped his corpse of every last coin before dumping it on my doorstep?\u201d</p><p>Cora\u2019s lip quivered. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that. I might have left Leo there, you know. Let him die on the street, unclaimed and alone.\u201d</p><p>Rhys sighed heavily. \u201cLeave off, Bellamy. God only knows what manner of lies the cur fed her, just to get under her skirts. She\u2019s not a bad girl, just too easily swayed.\u201d</p><p>Cora\u2019s bronze lashes trembled as she studied her hands. \u201cPerhaps I am.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy said hotly, \u201cI\u2019m only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only being an ass. I know. We\u2019re all getting weary of it. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s a curable condition.\u201d</p><p>He suspected it was. Bellamy was clearly still mourning the loss of his friend. He was hungry for answers; Cora craved affection. Rhys sympathized with them both, but he wasn\u2019t good with comfort or diplomacy. He had precisely two methods at his disposal for remedying people\u2019s problems: his right fist and his left. Yesterday he\u2019d dealt with Gideon Myles. Today he\u2019d see about Faraday.</p><p>The coach door swung open. Bellamy curled his fingers over the rooftop edge to help himself out. \u201cCome along, then. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>Rhys went first, then handed Cora out. They crossed an archipelago of stepping stones to reach the front entrance.</p><p>Bellamy extended his walking stick and rapped smartly on the door. \u201cHullo! We\u2019re here for Mr. Peter Faraday.\u201d</p><p>No answer. After a minute of waiting, Bellamy banged on the door again. \u201cHullo in there. Hullo!\u201d</p><p>The latch scraped. Finally, the door creaked open a space of inches. An ancient manservant revealed a thin slice of himself through the crack. Not that he likely had much more to show them. He was rather a thin slice of a man to start, dusted with powder-white hair. He\u2019d missed a button on his waistcoat, and as the result or perhaps the cause, his whole body was askew.</p><p>\u201cBeg pardon,\u201d Bellamy told the aging servant. \u201cWe\u2019ve traveled from London to speak with Mr. Peter Faraday on a matter of some urgency.\u201d</p><p>The old man grunted. \u201cUrgency? There\u2019s nothing urgent in this neighborhood, save my need to make water in the night. Furthermore, it\u2019s not noon yet, so Mr. Faraday is not at home to callers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, man. This isn\u2019t Mayfair. Damn your receiving hours. We\u2019re here now, and we demand to see him. If you won\u2019t step aside, we shall have to move you.\u201d</p><p>With a wheeze of indignation, the old man said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t even offered your card.\u201d</p><p>Sighing with impatience, Bellamy reached into his breast pocket and withdrew two coins. Rhys recognized one as a brass Stud Club token.</p><p>\u201cThis is our card. Show it to your master.\u201d In the old man\u2019s other palm, he dropped a guinea. \u201cThis one is for you.\u201d</p><p>The aging butler\u2019s hoary eyebrows rose. His fingers curled over the coins. \u201cWait here, gentlemen, if you\u2019d be so kind.\u201d</p><p>Within the minute, he\u2019d returned. He placed the brass token\u2014only\u2014back in Bellamy\u2019s hand. \u201cMr. Faraday will see you in the drawing room.\u201d</p><p>They followed the butler down a narrow corridor that seemed to have warped and twisted with age. The drawing room was empty, and the butler left them yet again, with no word as to when they might expect their host.</p><p>\u201cYou wait here.\u201d Bellamy dragged an armchair to the far corner of the room and settled Cora in it, partly behind a small screen. She wouldn\u2019t be immediately noticed there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For his part, Rhys took a seat on a threadbare divan and propped one boot on the small, square table before him.</p><p>Bellamy did not approve. \u201cYou\u2019ve been sitting in the carriage all day,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you have to sit down now? You\u2019re supposed to hulk in the corner and look threatening. Menacing, not ... cozy.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, Rhys stretched his arm across the back of the divan and surveyed the meager furnishings and cobwebbed corners. \u201cI thought this was supposed to be a well-heeled dandy we\u2019re chasing. Perhaps all his fortune is sunk into gold embroidery. It\u2019s certainly not poured into the furnishings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s in hiding. Why else would any man of means live all the way out here, in such humble accommodations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps because he enjoys the bracing sea breeze?\u201d An unfamiliar, cultured voice.</p><p>Rhys\u2019s gaze jerked to the doorway. There stood Peter Faraday, he presumed. And God, he could see what Cora meant. Faraday truly was the spitting image of Julian Bellamy. Or at least, a strikingly close resemblance. On examination, Faraday\u2019s hair was a dark brown, not jet black. He stood an inch or two shorter than Bellamy. His complexion was notably more pale. But in a darkened alley, the two would be virtually indistinguishable from one another.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Faraday said, leaning against the doorjamb, \u201cto what do I owe this pleasure?\u201d He wore a simple banyan over a shirt and loose-fitting trousers. His dark hair stuck up at odd angles. He looked as though he\u2019d just rolled out of bed to greet them and had no intention of going anywhere, anytime soon.</p><p>From the looks of him, Rhys would wager he hadn\u2019t been out of bed in weeks.</p> <p>\u201cBelieve me, there\u2019s no pleasure in it,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019ve seen the token, you know exactly why we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Faraday\u2019s gaze sharpened. He remained absolutely still. \u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>From his seat on the divan, Rhys shook his head. \u201cIf the two of you mean to be coy, we\u2019ll be here all day. Faraday, it\u2019s your house. Have a seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, I\u2019ll stand.\u201d</p><p>Rhys leaned forward, eyeing the man. \u201cNot for much longer, you won\u2019t.\u201d Faraday looked ready to swoon. So much for any plan of pummeling the truth out of him. Rhys might be a violent brute, but it simply wasn\u2019t in him to beat invalids. Faraday had obviously already taken his share of blows.</p><p>He said casually, \u201cSit down. Does that old fellow rattling his chains around know how to make tea? We\u2019ll all gather round and talk this out.\u201d</p> <p>Bellamy shot him a look. \u201cIn case you\u2019re wondering, that would be a complete and utter failure,\u201d he whispered, \u201cat being menacing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come along,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cLook at him. The longer he stands there, the more color drains from his face. The man won\u2019t even move, he\u2019s so stiff.\u201d He nodded at Faraday. \u201cHow many bones did you break, when you and Leo were attacked?\u201d</p><p>The man paused. \u201cMy hipbone. Three ribs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy left wrist.\u201d Faraday raised the appendage before his eyes and peered at it. \u201cI think there was a small fracture in one of the bones, but it seems to have knitted well on its own. Lost a few teeth. Other than that ... just bruises, but they\u2019ve long faded now.\u201d He cleared his throat self-consciously. \u201cI was the lucky one.\u201d</p><p>Surveying the man\u2019s posture and pinched expression, Rhys could tell he wasn\u2019t lying. If anything, he was understating the extent of his wounds. In that moment, Rhys was convinced of the man\u2019s innocence. Of all people, he knew what a trial it was to recover from injuries so severe. There was no way a man would willingly incur them just to mask his own involvement in a crime.</p><p>He stood up and crossed the room. Without a word, he slid a hand under Faraday\u2019s arm and lifted, transferring the wounded man\u2019s weight from the doorjamb to his own shoulder. Then he slowly walked him the three paces to a chair and helped him sit.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Faraday said, giving Rhys an amused look. \u201cThat was rather forward of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019d asked, you would have refused the help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>Rhys went back to his own chair. \u201cThe mending hurts worse than the breaking, I know. I\u2019ve snapped a bone or ten myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I gather.\u201d Faraday tilted his head a fraction. His gaze trained on the scar on Rhys\u2019s temple, then slid to the fresh split in his lip. \u201cYou must be Ashworth, the great war hero. Still doing battle, it would seem. Any teeth left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Giles makes excellent shortbread.\u201d He called over his shoulder. \u201cGiles!\u201d When the ancient manservant appeared in the doorway, Faraday instructed, \u201cTea, Giles. And shortbread, and a few sandwiches if you can muster them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have chocolate?\u201d Cora asked hopefully from the corner.</p><p>\u201cWell, hullo there.\u201d Faraday gave the girl a rakish smile. \u201cI thought Giles mentioned a pretty girl. Was beginning to think he\u2019d gone dotty and mistaken Mr. Bellamy here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Bellamy muttered. \u201cTea and shortbread. It\u2019s a regular party.\u201d</p><p>Faraday settled in his chair. \u201cI thought you loved nothing more than a party. That was always the word around Town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour use of the past tense is appropriate. I don\u2019t get around to so many parties of late.\u201d</p><p>An ironic smile crooked the wounded man\u2019s lips. \u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened that night?\u201d asked Rhys. \u201cStart from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Faraday took a deep breath. \u201cI went out to the East End for the boxing match, just like everyone else. Afterward, I happened to cross paths with Leo in the street. He called me over, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way Miss Dunn tells it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Dunn?\u201d Faraday folded his hands with a careful air of indifference. \u201cWho is Miss Dunn?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy gestured toward Cora. \u201cMiss Cora Dunn, the prostitute who found you after the attack. The one you directed to transport Leo to my address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Faraday blinked at the girl with new interest. \u201cSo sorry, dear. I didn\u2019t recognize you. It was dark that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says you were the one who called out to Leo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He worried the edge of his fingernail and shrugged one shoulder. \u201cPerhaps I did. Honestly, I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re lying to us,\u201d Bellamy said, his voice a low threat, \u201cthat is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you and Leo discuss?\u201d Rhys asked. \u201cCora says she heard arguing, shouting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Leo was vexed with me. You recall, I\u2019d lost my Stud Club token to the Duke of Morland a few days earlier. Leo was angry with me for wagering it. He knew Morland was out to collect all ten and disband the Club, and he\u2019d warned me not to play with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. As I told Leo, I\u2019d grown weary of his silly Club. With the likes of you two for members, it wasn\u2019t fun anymore. And I don\u2019t even breed horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do with your time?\u201d Bellamy asked contemptuously.</p><p>\u201cMuch the same as you, my friend. Spend money, when I have it. Perfect the art of leisure. Work at being very good at being good-for-nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d said Rhys, \u201cif that\u2019s your life\u2019s ambition, why have you come all the way out here to the edge of England?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed a place to convalesce. I\u2019m my uncle\u2019s heir, but for now I have no property of my own. This place came to mind. I once brought a sweet little blond here for a very pleasant summer holiday.\u201d He swept Cora with a gaze that Rhys did not appreciate. \u201cThe rent\u2019s cheap, and the servants are discreet.\u201d</p><p>Giles entered the drawing room, carrying a tea service that rattled precariously on its tray. Cora accepted the duty of pouring and began to distribute cups of the steaming brew to each gentleman.</p><p>\u201cWhy the need for discretion?\u201d Rhys asked him. \u201cYou were injured in a violent attack, and yet you fled the scene, leaving Leo in the care of a stranger. You left Town in secret, squirreled yourself away in this remote cottage, and never once attempted to have your attackers identified or brought to justice. Why?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy snorted. \u201cBecause he\u2019s hiding something, obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, love.\u201d After taking his cup from Cora, Faraday cautiously sipped his tea. \u201cWhat would I be hiding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I knew that, I wouldn\u2019t be here, now would I?\u201d said Bellamy, growing agitated.</p><p>\u201cTell us about the attack,\u201d Rhys interrupted. \u201cWhat exactly happened in that alley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I told you, Leo and I were having words about the tokens while Miss Dunn over there waited just round the bend. From the other end of the alley came two ruffians. We were taken unawares. Before we knew what was happening, they were upon us, slinging fists. We made our stab at defense, but the men were ... large. And determined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else can you tell us about them?\u201d Rhys asked.</p><p>\u201cCora said one was bald,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cAnd the other ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Scottish, from the sounds of him,\u201d the girl put in. \u201cI\u2019m almost certain of it.\u201d</p><p>Rhys leaned to the edge of his chair. \u201cWould you know them again, be able to identify them if they were caught?\u201d</p><p>Faraday put his hands to his temples. \u201cHonestly, once the beating started, I remember little. Bald or ginger, Irish or Scot, pug-nosed or six-fingered ... I\u2019ve no recollection. If I didn\u2019t even recognize Miss Dunn, how would I know those brutes again? There was no time to get a proper look. They didn\u2019t even go for our money before they started in on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if they weren\u2019t cut-purses, what were they after?\u201d</p><p>A strange look crossed Faraday\u2019s face. \u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>Rhys and Bellamy looked to one another, nonplussed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned. You truly don\u2019t know.\u201d Faraday rubbed his eyes for a long moment. Then he gave a throaty chuckle as he reached for a piece of shortbread. \u201cYou, Mr. Bellamy. They were after you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>Bellamy paled. \u201cWhat the hell are you saying?\u201d \u201cI meant just what I said,\u201d Faraday replied. \u201cThat attack was meant for you.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy leapt from his chair. A teacup crashed to the floor, and Cora flinched.</p><p>\u201cEasy, there.\u201d Faraday quirked a brow at Rhys. \u201cYour friend\u2019s hotheaded, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Raking both hands through his dark hair, Bellamy paced the room with agitation. Every few seconds, he punctuated his steps with a muttered oath.</p><p>Faraday watched him with a dispassionate gaze, leaning back in his chair. \u201cYou have to admit, it only makes sense. Everyone expected Leo to be with you that night, and the two of us share a strong resemblance. In the dark, we could easily be confused. The brutes weren\u2019t after money, just blood.\u201d</p><p>Rhys frowned. \u201cEven from that, you can\u2019t be sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeo was sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bellamy stopped pacing.</p><p>\u201cHe said, \u2018Tell Julian,\u2019\u201d Faraday said. He blinked a few times, cleared his throat. \u201cThose were his last words to me. He said them twice, as a matter of fact. Clear as day. \u2018Tell Julian.\u2019 Why do you think I gave Miss Dunn your address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus.\u201d Sinking his weight onto the windowsill, Bellamy put a hand to his eyes. \u201cI knew it. I knew his death was my fault.\u201d His voice broke. \u201cHow will I ever look Lily in the face again?\u201d</p><p>Faraday said, \u201cIf you value her safety, you\u2019d best stay clear of her entirely. Evidently, you\u2019re a dangerous man to be around. Leo never did know how to choose his company. This is what happens when you start a club and open membership to just anyone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rhys gave their host a scrutinizing look. \u201cIf all this is true, why didn\u2019t you wait for Cora to return? Go with her to Bellamy\u2019s house? Instead you slunk off and left Leo alone.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy said, \u201cHe\u2019s right. That makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>Faraday gave a defensive shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know ... I suppose I panicked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you have to fear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuestions. Suspicions. Being found alone with a dead man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if your story is truthful ...\u201d Rhys began.</p><p>\u201cIf,\u201d Bellamy emphasized.</p><p>\u201cIf your story is truthful, you would have nothing to fear from an inquiry,\u201d Rhys finished. \u201cNot to mention\u201d\u2014he eyed the man\u2019s legs\u2014\u201cyou walked back to your carriage with a broken hip?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Faraday winced as he said the word. \u201cI crawled.\u201d</p><p>That answer didn\u2019t sit right with Rhys. The man had dragged a broken leg and his gold-threaded waistcoat through the gutters of Whitechapel, rather than wait for assistance?</p><p>Faraday absorbed Rhys\u2019s skeptical look. \u201cAs I said, I panicked. And ...\u201d He blew out a slow breath. \u201cI knew he was going to die. And I didn\u2019t want to watch him go. Just couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you left him to die alone,\u201d Bellamy choked out. \u201cIn a dark, filthy alley, with a whore for company.\u201d</p><p>Faraday picked up his teacup and stared into it, hard. \u201cDo you know, I believe I\u2019ve had enough society for today. Miss Dunn, once again your pretty face has improved a very bleak occasion. It\u2019s been lovely, but I really must ask you all to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lying bastard,\u201d Bellamy snarled. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere until you tell us the truth. I want answers.\u201d</p> <p>Faraday\u2019s eyes snapped up. \u201cI\u2019ve given you answers. A good many of them. Here are some more. What are my parents\u2019 names? Jason and Emmeline Faraday. My childhood home? In Yorkshire. Where did I have my education? At Harrow and Cambridge. I\u2019m just full of honest answers to those kinds of questions, Mr. Bellamy.\u201d He set his teacup down with a crack. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy history has nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I suspect it does. And I think I deserve to hear it, considering that I\u2019ve spent the past months recovering from blows meant for you.\u201d</p><p>A tense silence saturated the room. Bellamy tapped Rhys\u2019s shoulder and jerked his head toward the corner. Taking the hint, Rhys rose from his seat on the divan and followed him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTime for muscle,\u201d Bellamy whispered.</p><p>Rhys shook his head. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, the man\u2019s already injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to see he\u2019s lying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suspect he\u2019s not being entirely truthful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it what you want, he\u2019s hiding something. If you hit him hard enough, you\u2019ll shake his secrets loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Rhys gave him a cool look. \u201cAnd if I hit you hard enough, I could shake loose all of yours.\u201d He let the threat sink in a few seconds before adding, \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to do it. I\u2019m not a bully, as someone reminded me recently.\u201d Someone he missed more acutely with each passing minute.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Ashworth. Leo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeo,\u201d Rhys interjected, \u201cwouldn\u2019t want me to hit him. I\u2019m certain of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d Rhys put a hand on Bellamy\u2019s shoulder. Then he tightened his grip, by slow degrees, until he was sure the man comprehended his meaning.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bellamy,\u201d Faraday said, bracing his hands on the armrests and struggling to his feet, \u201cI assure you, I\u2019ve given you all the help I can. If you want to find Leo\u2019s murderers, there\u2019s really only one question that needs answering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wants you dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wants me dead?\u201d Bellamy muttered to himself from where he\u2019d sunk into the corner of the coach. \u201cThe better question would be, who doesn\u2019t want me dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you dead,\u201d Rhys said. Then he added honestly, \u201cBut then I\u2019m rather ambivalent to your general existence.\u201d His teeth rattled as they jounced over a rut in the lane. \u201cWeren\u2019t you with a woman that night?\u201d he asked. \u201cA married lady, if I recall. Thought she was the reason you cried off the boxing match. What was her name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarnelia. Lady Carnelia Hightower. But if her husband intended to murder her lovers, I\u2019d be holding up the end of a very long queue.\u201d Bellamy sighed. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t him. But there are others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther jealous husbands? Or other enemies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. What do you care?\u201d</p><p>Rhys shrugged. \u201cI suppose I don\u2019t. Where are we headed, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m for Town. I\u2019ll have to go to ground, skulk around a bit and see what I can find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the girl?\u201d Rhys asked. \u201cI can\u2019t offer her protection anymore.\u201d He\u2019d go to London, too. See his solicitor there, discuss arrangements for the estate and George Lane\u2019s pension. Then he\u2019d think about what to do next. Perhaps the army again. He could buy back his commission. Or there was mercenary work, if he wanted a change of pace. England wasn\u2019t currently at war, but surely there was something that needed destroying somewhere. Preferably somewhere far away. Maybe if he put an ocean between himself and Meredith, this fierce ache in his chest would ease.</p><p>\u201cKindly don\u2019t discuss me as if I\u2019m not here,\u201d Cora said, hugging her arms across her chest. \u201cI should think I\u2019d be free to do as I please, now that you\u2019ve found Mr. Faraday. And I want to go back to the Three Hounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to return there?\u201d asked Bellamy.</p><p>\u201cI like working at the inn. I like the villagers, and they like me. I was happy there.\u201d</p><p>The coach took a sharp curve in the road, and they all leaned into the turn.</p><p>Bellamy said, \u201cThis is about that Gideon Myles, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot completely,\u201d the girl replied, blushing. \u201cBut yes, in part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing good will come of it, you know. The man\u2019s a petty smuggler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmuggler or no, he cares for me.\u201d She glanced at Rhys. \u201cThere\u2019s someone in Buckleigh-in-the-Moor who cares for you too, my lord. Don\u2019t you want to go back?\u201d</p><p>Rhys sighed and turned his head to the window. The carriage had turned off the coastal lane, and he caught one last glimpse of the dramatic Cornish cliffs as they began the gentle climb back to the main road. Gravity tugged on him as they made their way up the grade, and he slipped toward the edge of the rear-facing seat. He propped one boot on the opposite bench, bracing himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of whether I want to go back. It\u2019s a matter of what\u2019s best for everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cListen, Cora. It\u2019s nice that you want to settle down. But pick a better man to settle down with. A scoundrel like that will bring you nothing but trouble. Believe me, I speak from experience. I\u2019ve lived a devil\u2019s life, and now someone\u2019s out to kill me. I wouldn\u2019t wish myself on any lady, much less the one I actually\u2014\u201d He broke off.</p><p>Rhys finished the thought for him. \u201cI think what Bellamy here is trying to say is, if Gideon Myles truly cared for you, he\u2019d leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>Cora sat up on her seat. \u201cWhat nonsense,\u201d she said hotly. \u201cWhat absolute cowardly rot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCowardly?\u201d Bellamy and Rhys spoke as one.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he has done some bad things in his life,\u201d she said. \u201cBut why can\u2019t a man change? I changed. I\u2019m not a whore any longer. I want an honest life now, and maybe Gideon wants the same.\u201d She shook her head. \u201c\u2018If he cared for you, he\u2019d leave you alone,\u2019\u201d she muttered, mimicking Rhys\u2019s deep voice. Her bold gaze met his. \u201cIf he truly cares for me, he\u2019ll stay. And do better.\u201d</p><p>Rhys stared at her, surprised. Was this the same girl who\u2019d trembled in his presence not a few weeks ago? He wasn\u2019t sure about Myles\u2019s prospects for an honest life, but he felt certain Cora wouldn\u2019t be any man\u2019s whore again. The girl knew her own value now. Good for her. Meredith\u2019s influence was to thank, most likely. She had a way of letting people know their worth.</p><p>Maybe Cora was right. Maybe he was being cowardly. Back in Devonshire, there was a woman who loved him. Loved him enough to risk her own life to save his in a split-second decision, then devote the next fourteen years to coping with the consequences. Caring for herself, her father, the village. And she would do it all again.</p><p>Of course it terrified him. How could it not? The whole tragedy still traced back to him\u2014but it wasn\u2019t the result of Rhys being unwanted or worthless. It was the result of his being loved. Meredith thought saving his life was worth every sacrifice, and if he wanted to be with her, he would have to somehow find the courage within himself to agree. Christ. And he\u2019d thought accepting her gift of a shaving kit was difficult?</p><p>He\u2019d never run from a battle in his life, but Rhys was running like hell from this.</p><p>The ache in his chest intensified. He couldn\u2019t understand why being loved hurt so damn much. And it didn\u2019t help matters any when the carriage gave a violent lurch.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Cora asked, flinching at the loud crack of a whip.</p><p>Rhys tensed. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He heard the coachman shouting at the horses from the driver\u2019s box, urging them forward. The entire carriage gave a violent shudder. There was another jolt, this one more jarring than the first. Rhys nearly lost his perch on the seat as the carriage came to a dead stop.</p><p>Bellamy looked to Rhys. \u201cWould it help if we offered to walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>They never had a chance to act on the idea. With a low, foreboding creak, the carriage began to roll.</p><p>Backward.</p><p>For the second time in a week, Meredith slept through noon. The inn had no guests, thankfully. She didn\u2019t suppose any locals would be expecting full breakfast today, and if they did\u2014well, they would learn to live with the disappointment.</p><p>When she finally gathered the strength to wash, dress, and trudge down the back stairs, she was stunned to find the public room full of men. They\u2019d all gathered round the slate fixed to the wall, arguing and debating. Standing atop a chair, Darryl looked to be defending both the slate and his very life with naught but a nub of chalk. \u201cNow, gentlemen ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat purse should be mine,\u201d Skinner said, thumping his chest. \u201cI had five weeks. Didn\u2019t nobody have money on longer.\u201d</p><p>Harry Symmonds shook his head. \u201cBut it\u2019s been more than five weeks, hasn\u2019t it? That doesn\u2019t make your bet right, just makes it wrong like the rest. Tewkes, just cancel the wagers and call it square.\u201d</p><p>Meredith couldn\u2019t believe it. After all that had happened yesterday, they were here this morning to argue over a ridiculous bet? From the bar, she put finger and thumb in her mouth and whistled for attention. When the lot of them swiveled to face her, she finally found her voice. \u201cWhat the devil are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Skinner shrugged. \u201cWell, since Lord Ashworth\u2019s left the village ... There are wagers to be settled, Mrs. Maddox.\u201d</p><p>Her face burned with anger. With a trembling hand, she retrieved a damp sponge from underneath the bar and threw it at Darryl. It hit his shoulder with a wet squelch, and he yelped with surprise.</p><p>\u201cWipe that slate clean,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>Darryl obeyed while the men looked on in silence.</p><p>\u201cNow get out,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of you. The Three Hounds is closed until further notice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The men didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cOut!\u201d she shouted, jabbing a finger at the door. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>As they shuffled toward the exit, jostling and grumbling amongst themselves, an anxious-looking Darryl called over the din. \u201cIt\u2019s only temporary, gents! Don\u2019t count out the Three Hounds. We\u2019ll have this place fixed up in no time, me and Mrs. Maddox, and we\u2019ll be serving pints again before you know it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t make promises, Darryl,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cGo see to the horse barn. Surely there\u2019s a stall that needs mucking out, if you\u2019re in the mood to shovel excrement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Mrs. Maddox.\u201d Darryl moved toward her, apparently choosing not to take offense. \u201cI know the place looks bad, but we\u2019ll have it back to form in no time. And it will all work out for the best in the end. It\u2019s like you said. Men come and go, but this road is always here. And so\u2019s the inn. We always have the Three Hounds. It\u2019s our home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Darryl.\u201d The youth\u2019s words were well-meant, she supposed, but they didn\u2019t offer her much consolation. This inn didn\u2019t feel like home, not anymore. \u201cNow, if you don\u2019t mind ... I really would like a moment to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mrs. Maddox. We\u2019ll sort out the glassware this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Meredith stared after him, wondering if she needed to talk with Darryl about minding his place. The young man was growing a touch presumptive.</p> <p>Once he\u2019d left and she was alone, Meredith sat in one of the few remaining sturdy chairs. She looked around at the building she\u2019d worked so hard to improve, taken so much pride in running with efficiency and style. She\u2019d always said her heart was in this inn. And perhaps it had been, once. But it wasn\u2019t anymore. Her heart was with Rhys, and he was gone. She stacked her arms on the table before her and bent her head.</p><p>Barely a minute had passed before strong hands landed on her shoulders, massaging gently. \u201cThere, there, Merry. It\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Father.\u201d She wiped her eyes with her wrist as her father rounded the table and slid into the chair opposite. She hated to tell him this, but postponing the inevitable wouldn\u2019t help. \u201cHe\u2019s gone. Rhys left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I know you must be disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Don\u2019t worry about me, child.\u201d He wrapped her hands in his own scarred, arthritic grip. \u201cRhys will be back. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou truly believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only one. They\u2019re already starting another betting pool in the courtyard. Skinner\u2019s taking wagers as to when Lord Ashworth will return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBand of fools,\u201d she muttered, shaking her head. \u201cBloody ingrates. After the way this village treated him, why would he ever want to come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you, Merry. Everyone knows he\u2019ll come back for you.\u201d His eyes warmed and crinkled at the edges. \u201cAnd my money\u2019s on tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Cora said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d Rhys braced himself as the carriage began to move. Slowly at first. Then it picked up speed, rattling unimpeded down the slope they\u2019d just climbed. \u201cWe\u2019ve come unhitched from the team. Must have been the jolt just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually.\u201d Rhys stood, as much as he was able, and braced his hands on the hardtop carriage roof. Leveraging his strength, he kicked at the carriage door, blasting the latch to pieces. \u201cBut not today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Cora asked.</p><p>Rhys offered her his hand and a one-word explanation. \u201cJump.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open as she looked toward the now-open door and the accelerating landscape rolling past. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p><p>Rhys took a brief glance out the carriage\u2019s rear window. Just as he\u2019d feared, the coach was speeding straight for the coastline\u2014and those dramatic cliffs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s jump now or plummet later,\u201d he insisted. When she still didn\u2019t move, he motioned to Bellamy. \u201cGet her out of here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Bellamy shook off his surprise and leapt into action, grabbing Cora by the wrist and tugging her toward the open door. He stood behind the girl, wrapping one arm about her midsection and bracing the other on the rooftop.</p><p>Rhys would have jumped with Cora himself, but he could barely fit through the door on his own, much less with a girl in his arms. He hoped Bellamy didn\u2019t cock it up. \u201cPut your legs into it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to clear the wheels.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy nodded grimly. \u201cOn three, Cora. One ... Two ...\u201d</p><p>Cora cringed. \u201cCan\u2019t we do it on five?\u201d</p><p>The carriage jounced against some obstacle, and she screamed as the whole business teetered on two wheels.</p><p>The moment the coach crashed back to all four, Rhys made the decision. No more hesitating. Planting his boot on Bellamy\u2019s backside, Rhys flexed his thigh and shoved with all his strength. \u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>Oddly satisfying. He\u2019d been wanting to give Julian Bellamy a swift kick in the arse.</p><p>The two disappeared from the carriage, and when the entire conveyance didn\u2019t snap an axle or overturn, Rhys assumed that meant they\u2019d cleared the wheels. Time for him to follow.</p><p>But just as he made his way to the open door, the speeding coach hit a rock. Or perhaps it jumped the side of the road. No way to tell, but the thing went airborne for a stomach-launching second. Then it landed with a splintering crunch of wood, careening to one side.</p><p>Rhys was thrown away from the door, against the far side of the carriage. His head hit the window with a violent crack. The world oscillated between light and dark for a moment as he danced on the brink of consciousness.</p><p>When his wits returned to him, all he knew was that the carriage wasn\u2019t rolling anymore. But neither had it come to a halt. The wrecked cab bounced and tumbled from one obstacle to the next, skipping down the rocky turf as it obeyed the pull of gravity. Progressing steadily toward that cliff.</p><p>Rhys could go with it. He could.</p><p>He lay stunned and breathless, a jumble of limbs on the floor. His head was pounding with pain. It would be so easy to just stay there. Allow the wreckage to carry him over the cliff and dash him on the rocks below. End it all, today.</p><p>He kept waiting for that voice to speak up, echo off the walls of his skull. Get up. Stand, you miserable wretch. Rise and take more.</p><p>It didn\u2019t come. Unlike every other time he\u2019d courted death, this time the dark cellar of his mind was eerily quiet. He didn\u2019t hear his father goading and taunting him, forcing him back to life. The old bastard had finally been silenced.</p><p>Instead, he heard her. He heard Meredith. His beautiful, strong, sweet Meredith. Her words were the sounds echoing in his ears. I love you, Rhys. Stay. Don\u2019t go.</p><p>What a bloody miracle. He didn\u2019t want to leave this earth today. He wanted to stay, and do better.</p><p>Which meant he had to get out of this deathtrap. Now, if not sooner.</p><p>A wild jounce of the hobbled carriage conveniently tossed him toward the door. The next bump would have thrown him straight back, but Rhys grabbed the edge of the door opening and gripped it with all his strength.</p><p>Another jarring blow and loud crunch of wood\u2014some wheel or axle giving way. The resulting tilt sent the coach into a wild, spiraling skid. It also sent the door slamming shut on his fingers. Rhys growled with pain.</p><p>But somehow, despite the imminent destruction of the coach, he got his legs under him, shouldered the door open, spared one brief glance at the ground to judge his distance ...</p><p>And jumped.</p><p>A moment too late.</p><p>It was a beautiful day to die.</p><p>The sun shone overhead, warm and comforting. A fresh, salty breeze wafted over his skin. For a moment, all Rhys could hear was the music of distant seagulls and the gentle rhythm of waves. Then came the deafening crash, as the carriage exploded on the jagged boulders below.</p><p>He winced, clinging desperately to the rocky overhang. Two handfuls of crumbling basalt were all that kept him from following the same vertical path to his own doom. Twisting his neck, he looked down and caught a glimpse of the carriage. Or rather, the driftwood and flotsam that had once been a carriage.</p><p>Rhys kicked his feet in exploration, scouting for some surface he could push off from. His booted toes scraped the cliff\u2019s sheer face, but he couldn\u2019t get enough leverage. If only his fingers hadn\u2019t been slammed in that door a few seconds earlier. Then he might have found more strength in his hands\u2014enough to hang on, pull up, swing a leg over the edge. As it was, he could barely keep himself from tumbling into the sea.</p><p>His vision grayed at the edges, rippling in the center like the surface of a pool. Damn it all. Wasn\u2019t this just the way his life went? He\u2019d finally stopped wanting to die. And on the very same day, a stupid carriage accident would manage to kill him.</p><p>God, he loved Meredith. He loved her so much. Now he\u2019d never have a chance to say it. He could only hope that she somehow knew. It was entirely possible she did know, even though he\u2019d never said the words. She was a clever woman.</p><p>He shut his eyes and turned his concentration inward, bargaining with his weakened, aching fingers. Hold on now, he told them, and you can stroke her later. To distract himself from the dizzying height, he let his mind wander over all the parts of her body he most wanted to touch. Which was every part of her, truly. From her abundant dark hair to her neatly turned toes. And his lust for her body was nothing compared to the admiration he had for her strength of spirit, her generous heart.</p><p>As the strength ebbed from his arms, he began to shake. He turned his concentration inward, focusing on that steady beat of his heart. The heart that loved her so very much. He wasn\u2019t dead yet. Not so long as that heart kept beating.</p><p>Thump. Thump. A worrying pause. Thump.</p><p>Something landed on his arm, and he jerked reflexively, losing another fingerhold.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ashworth. I\u2019m trying to help.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy. It was Bellamy, come to help. Oddly enough, Rhys didn\u2019t feel especially rescued.</p><p>\u201cTake my hand,\u201d Bellamy said, waving the suggested appendage in Rhys\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cLike hell I will,\u201d Rhys managed to growl. \u201cI\u2019m heavier than you. Unless you have a solid foothold to brace yourself against, you won\u2019t lift me up. I\u2019ll just pull you over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA valid point.\u201d Bellamy lowered himself onto his belly and peered down past Rhys\u2019s dangling feet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t suppose there\u2019s a convenient outcropping a foot or two beneath me?\u201d Rhys ventured.</p><p>\u201cNo. The only thing beneath you is certain death.\u201d Bellamy shot to his feet and began digging his boots into the soil. \u201cBack to the first plan. There\u2019s a ridge here. I\u2019ll brace my boots. You take my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll have to work. Do you have some better idea?\u201d</p><p>Rhys had to admit he didn\u2019t. \u201cAll right, then. On three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter that trick in the carriage?\u201d Bellamy shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t trust you with counting. Just give me your hand.\u201d</p><p>His right hand had the more secure grip, so Rhys shifted his weight as far as he could to that side. Then he gingerly stretched up his left.</p><p>The instant he did so, two things happened. Bellamy\u2019s grip locked around his left wrist. And Rhys\u2019s right hand began losing ground. Grit crumbled under his fingernails as his splayed fingers slid down and down. Both men swore in unison. If Rhys lost that grip, he\u2019d be dangling by one hand, a dead weight at the end of Bellamy\u2019s arms. Bellamy wouldn\u2019t be able to hold him for long, much less pull him up.</p><p>Rhys clawed wildly for a new grip. Nothing. His fingers only slid closer and closer to the edge.</p><p>Stomp.</p><p>Rhys roared with pain as Bellamy stepped on his right hand, pinning it to the ground with his boot. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes. \u201cHoly Christ.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on, then,\u201d Bellamy grated through his teeth, tugging on Rhys\u2019s left arm. \u201cUp with you.\u201d</p><p>The hand currently grinding beneath Bellamy\u2019s boot hurt like hell. But at least it wasn\u2019t sliding anymore. By flexing the muscles in his arms and abdomen, Rhys was able to hoist himself up enough to swing a leg over the cliff\u2019s edge.</p><p>A few grunting, heaving seconds later, he lay on solid ground, rasping for breath and staring up at the bright blue sky. Alive.</p> <p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d Bellamy joined him, collapsing on the rock-strewn grass. \u201cI\u2019ll say this, Ashworth. Things are never dull when you\u2019re around.\u201d</p><p>The little finger on his right hand stood out from the rest at an awkward angle. Rhys blinked at it, dazed by the familiar pain. \u201cI think you broke my finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I saved your life. And that\u2019s after you kicked me in the arse, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Cora?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy tilted his head toward the upslope. \u201cHer ankle\u2019s turned, I think. Driver looks like hell, but he\u2019ll live.\u201d</p> <p>Rhys pinched his mangled little finger between thumb and forefinger of the opposite hand. Gritting his teeth, he yanked the broken digit straight out, then drew a breath and forced it back in its proper alignment, wincing at the bright slice of pain.</p><p>It was just as he\u2019d told Faraday. The mending always hurt worse than the breaking.</p><p>He looked up to see Cora and the coachman limping down the slope.</p><p>Cora approached the cliff warily, took a peek over the edge, then reeled backward, pale and panting. \u201cLa.\u201d</p><p>Rhys took in the driver\u2019s torn clothing and scraped arms. In the accident, he must have flown straight off the driver\u2019s box. \u201cAre you well?\u201d he asked the coachman, pushing to his feet. \u201cThe horses?\u201d</p><p>The driver nodded. \u201cAll safe, my lord.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe traces just snapped. First the right side, then the left. Once they were gone, the splinter bar couldn\u2019t hold. A clean break between coach and team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSabotage,\u201d Bellamy breathed. \u201cFaraday was right. Someone\u2019s out to kill me.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cMaybe Faraday himself. Maybe he had someone working on this while you were enjoying your tea and shortbread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe,\u201d Rhys said, \u201cthe traces just snapped and not everything is about you.\u201d He scoffed at the idea of Faraday\u2019s decrepit servant crawling under the carriage with a file or rasp. \u201cBad luck, plain and simple.\u201d</p><p>His curiosity finally overcoming his dizziness, Rhys peered down over the cliff. The ground fell away steeply. Far below, the sea chewed on the twisted wreckage with jaws of rock and wave. The entire coach had splintered to pieces. No man could have survived that fall.</p><p>Feeling suddenly breathless, he gave his cravat a vicious tug. The magnitude of the past few minutes\u2019 events began to sink in. \u201cGood God,\u201d he said wonderingly. \u201cI almost died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all did,\u201d Bellamy said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but ... that never happens to me.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve come close dozens of times, but never like that. I really, truly almost died. I could not have saved myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as my outpouring of gratitude,\u201d said Bellamy. \u201cAre you always this churlish when someone saves your life?\u201d</p><p>Rhys winced, thinking of Meredith. \u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>Cora indicated her own temple. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He touched a hand to his brow. His fingers came away wet with blood. Still huffing for breath as he straightened, Rhys reached for the handkerchief in his breast pocket.</p><p>Instead, his fingers closed over two odd-shaped coins.</p><p>He pulled one of them out and squinted at it. A thin disc of brass, stamped with a horse\u2019s head on one side and its tail on the other. Leo Chatwick\u2019s Stud Club token.</p><p>\u201cBellamy,\u201d he said. \u201cHeads or tails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an experiment. Just call heads or tails.\u201d</p><p>The man shrugged. \u201cTails.\u201d</p><p>Rhys tossed the coin and caught it, slapping it flat against his wrist. When he removed his hand, the horse\u2019s arse shining up at him seemed like the funniest goddamned thing he\u2019d ever seen. Laughter rumbled from his chest. Leo always did love a good joke.</p><p>\u201cHere. This one was Leo\u2019s.\u201d He tossed the token at a befuddled Bellamy, who caught it handily. \u201cNow it\u2019s yours. I lost.\u201d</p><p>Who would have guessed it? By all things holy and profane, he\u2019d lost. It would seem his cursed good luck had finally run out. He\u2019d have to learn some new tricks\u2014like the practice of caution. No longer would he stumble through the world, flipping that coin with \u201cLife\u201d on one side and \u201cDeath\u201d on the other. He\u2019d make his own fate now.</p><p>And Rhys knew just where\u2014and with whom\u2014he wanted to make it.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>It was nearing noon when they returned to Buckleigh-in-the-Moor the next day, riding single file on the four draft horses. They must have been quite a sight. Villagers swarmed out of their houses to watch as, one by one, Rhys, Bellamy, Cora, and their much-abused driver clopped down the road and into the courtyard of the Three Hounds. Rhys had hated stopping the night yesterday. Everything in him had wanted to return to Meredith as soon as possible. Fall on his knees, pledge his love, beg her forgiveness for everything. What words he\u2019d employ in that effort, he couldn\u2019t begin to imagine. Well, three particular words were a given. Beyond that, he just hoped for inspiration in the moment.</p><p>But Cora\u2019s ankle had needed a doctor\u2019s attention, and they\u2019d each had small injuries to tend. There were other basic needs, too: rest, food, proper saddles. He\u2019d forced himself to be patient, wait.</p><p>Now they were here, and he wasn\u2019t waiting a second longer. The moment he slowed his horse, he dismounted and hurried toward the inn\u2019s door.</p><p>He was intercepted by Gideon Myles. The man came tearing out from the entrance. His face was one big bruise, and his steps were hobbled, and his mien was determined. He was a man with a destination in mind.</p><p>And Rhys wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>He brushed straight past Rhys and Bellamy both, rushing to help Cora down from her horse.</p><p>\u201cCora.\u201d He tugged the girl into his arms, burying his face in her hair. \u201cCora, thank the Lord you\u2019re back. I woke up and you were gone, and I didn\u2019t have the strength to go after you ...\u201d He hugged her close. \u201cI would have never let you leave. You\u2019re not getting out of my sight again.\u201d</p><p>Rhys harrumphed loudly.</p><p>Myles pulled back from the embrace, surveying the bruise on Cora\u2019s cheek and the tattered edge of her cloak. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you?\u201d He turned a burning gaze on Rhys and Bellamy. \u201cIf you\u2019ve hurt her, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Rhys said impatiently, \u201cOh, suddenly you care about the girl\u2019s welfare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I care. And there\u2019s nothing sudden about it.\u201d He rubbed his hands up and down the girl\u2019s arms. \u201cI love her, more than my own life. Would have said as much the other day, if someone hadn\u2019t smashed his fist in my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Cora asked, blinking hard. \u201cYou ... you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, truly.\u201d He pulled her aside from the crowd, just a step. \u201cI love you. And I\u2019ve a question to ask you, but I\u2019m just vain enough that I hate to ask it looking like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably for the best,\u201d she said shyly. \u201cIt\u2019s come to my attention that I may be too easily swayed by fine looks and charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m low on both at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d She smiled, feathering her fingers through his hair. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s worth asking, the question will keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Myles said, a slow grin spreading across his face. \u201cYou mean to make me work for it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, lacing her arms about his neck.</p><p>\u201cGood girl. You should.\u201d Bending his head to hers, the man kissed her soundly. And quite thoroughly, considering the swollen state of his jaw.</p><p>As the assembled crowd cheered the young couple, Bellamy came to stand at Rhys\u2019s side. \u201cSpares me the trouble of finding her a new place.\u201d</p><p>Damn Gideon Myles and his scene-stealing. Rhys wanted his own happy reunion. \u201cWhere the devil is Meredith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you hand me the scissors, please?\u201d From her perch atop the crate, Meredith braced her weight on the window frame and leaned sideways, extending an arm. \u201cThey\u2019re just there, over by the lace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d Riffling his sandy hair with one hand, Darryl scouted the heaps of fabric and thread until he located the missing sewing shears. Then he loped across the cottage loft and delivered them to her hand with a gallant flourish. \u201cThere you are.\u201d \u201cThank you, Darryl.\u201d</p><p>The youth smiled. \u201cAnything for you, Mrs. Maddox.\u201d</p><p>Meredith returned to her task. She stretched a length of twine from the top of the window to the sill, then cut it to the exact length. Looping that strand around her neck for safekeeping, she started another measurement crossways.</p><p>\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Darryl asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat are what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese.\u201d</p><p>Craning her neck, she glimpsed him holding a misshapen lump of wood in his hand, turning it this way and that for examination.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re flowers,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain? Look like vegetables to me. Aren\u2019t these cabbages over here? And this one has the look of celery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tulip. They\u2019re flowers.\u201d She smiled to herself as she turned back to her measurements.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>She heard a dull thunk as Darryl tossed the tulip finial aside.</p><p>\u201cYou surely are anxious to make these curtains,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry, Mrs. Maddox? I thought you\u2019d be more concerned about repairing the tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat tavern is perpetually in need of something.\u201d Frowning with concentration, she folded her lip under her teeth. \u201cThere,\u201d she said, cutting off the final window measurement. To Darryl, she continued, \u201cI just want this place looking nice by the time Rhys comes back. Looking like a home.\u201d</p><p>Darryl chuckled. \u201cMrs. Maddox, Lord Ashworth\u2019s not coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cI know he left, but he\u2019ll be back. Eventually.\u201d Hopefully before another fourteen years passed. But no matter how long it took, she\u2019d be waiting. Call it destiny. Call it faith. Whatever it was, she seemed to have caught the brain-addling contagion from Rhys, and she didn\u2019t want to be cured.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mrs. Maddox.\u201d Darryl\u2019s voice was strangely confident. \u201cHe isn\u2019t coming back.\u201d</p><p>Meredith turned her neck slowly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>His left eye twitched as he gave her a placid smile. \u201cHe won\u2019t trouble this place anymore. I\u2019ve made certain of it. Buckleigh-in-the-Moor is free of the Ashworth line. Forever.\u201d</p><p>Her heart began to beat a little faster, though she bade herself to stay calm. This was Darryl Tewkes talking. Surely this was just another of his wild, imagined tales. She stepped down from the crate, and her feet hit the floor with a hollow thud. \u201cDarryl, what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fixed matters for you. For everyone.\u201d He picked up a length of lace and began folding it. \u201cAren\u2019t you pleased?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I\u2019m not pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now. I know you\u2019re an independent woman and you like to do things your way, but you mustn\u2019t be angry with me, Mrs. Maddox. He left me no choice. We tried to give him the suggestion to leave, but the man can\u2019t take a hint. First the torches didn\u2019t work, and neither did moving his rocks about. Tried pitching a stone at him, and that didn\u2019t work either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was you?\u201d</p><p>Meredith was aghast. When Gideon had awoken this afternoon, the two of them had shared a pot of tea and a lengthy conversation. Among other things, he\u2019d sworn he wasn\u2019t responsible for Rhys\u2019s injury that night at the ruins. Since he had no reason to lie about it now, she\u2019d concluded the whole thing must have been an accident.</p><p>Evidently she\u2019d concluded wrong.</p> <p>Through sheer force of will, she kept her voice even. \u201cDarryl, what did you do to Lord Ashworth? Tell me this instant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to him. Let\u2019s just say I gave Mr. Bellamy\u2019s carriage a bit of special attention.\u201d</p><p>Meredith gasped. \u201cMr. Bellamy\u2019s carriage? But ... but Cora went with them!\u201d Hadn\u2019t Darryl been half in love with the girl? Every male in the village was half in love with the girl.</p><p>\u201cOh, you mean the harlot?\u201d He shook his head, tsking softly. \u201cShe seemed nice enough at the beginning, but she showed her true colors in the end. We\u2019re better off without her, Mrs. Maddox. The Three Hounds isn\u2019t that sort of inn.\u201d</p><p>She could only stare at him, transfixed with disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know what I wonder?\u201d His little smile crawled over her skin. \u201cI wonder if he\u2019ll truly haunt us when he\u2019s dead. I hope he does. The travelers would like that. I\u2019ll have to change my story a bit, but that\u2019s all right. What do you think, Mrs. Maddox?\u201d he asked, moving toward her. \u201cWhich sounds better? \u2018The Phantom Lord\u2019? Or \u2018The Ghostly Baron\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither,\u201d she said, stepping back. A floorboard creaked. Her fingers tightened around the sewing scissors in her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t come any closer. You\u2019re frightening me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just stories, Mrs. Maddox. And it\u2019s only me. You know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be angry.\u201d He moved closer. \u201cI did it for you. For us. We were doing well for ourselves until Lord Ashworth came back. Bringing his fancy London friend and that harlot around, making trouble for the whole village. He tore up the tavern, tried to take you away.\u201d Darryl gestured angrily. \u201cI couldn\u2019t watch him destroy the Three Hounds, Mrs. Maddox. I\u2019ve worked too hard for that place.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d worked too hard? \u201cDarryl, you fool. No one\u2019s worked harder for that place than I have. And I\u2019m telling you, Lord Ashworth\u2019s return was the best thing to ever happen to Buckleigh-in-the-Moor. The best thing to ever happen to me. How dare you, you ...\u201d</p> <p>Despite all her resolve to be strong, Meredith began to tremble. Her eyes fluttered closed, and horrid possibilities flashed behind them. Rhys always claimed to be indestructible, but no man was immortal. What if Darryl had somehow managed to ...</p><p>No.</p><p>She opened her eyes, and she knew. She just knew, with a profound, bone-deep certainty, that everything was going to be fine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Darryl. Lord Ashworth is coming back. Not as a ghost or a phantom, but alive and whole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Mrs. Maddox, you\u2019re not listening ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m telling you, he\u2019s coming back. I\u2019ve never been so sure of anything in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s standing behind you right now.\u201d</p> <p>Darryl froze. He gulped loudly. His eyelashes danced a wild jig as he turned by slow degrees, then tilted his head up.</p><p>And up.</p><p>And up, all the way to Rhys\u2019s waiting glare.</p><p>\u201cBoo.\u201d With a lightning-quick motion, Rhys grabbed Darryl by the throat. The younger man squirmed and sputtered, clawing in vain at Rhys\u2019s grip.</p><p>\u201cYou scheming little bastard,\u201d Rhys snarled. \u201cI knew I didn\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Cora well?\u201d Meredith asked, nearly beside herself with emotion.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s well.\u201d Rhys tightened his grip, and the shade of Darryl\u2019s face deepened from scarlet to plum. \u201cBut she could have died. We all could have died.\u201d He gave the youth a shake. \u201cI\u2019ve a mind to throw you in the bog, let the wild pigs sniff you out.\u201d</p><p>Tears were streaming down Darryl\u2019s face by this point, and his violet complexion was tending toward blue.</p><p>\u201cRhys,\u201d Meredith said, tilting her head toward the youth. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He instantly released his grip.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Rhys muttered as Darryl fell to the floor, dragging in air with raspy gulps. \u201cLucky for you, this is the week I give up killing men with my bare hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGads.\u201d Darryl writhed on the floor, clutching his stomach and gasping like a fish plucked from a stream.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. Breathe.\u201d</p><p>Rhys glared at him. \u201cBurns, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Darryl\u2019s head jerked in response.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m glad.\u201d Rhys turned to Meredith. \u201cI know that feeling, Merry.\u201d He spoke low and only to her. \u201cI\u2019ve dangled at the brink of death more times than I can count. And that steep climb back to life, it hurts like hell. The pain of an injury is over in seconds. Everything that comes after is the pain of getting well.\u201d He gave her a heartfelt look, full of apology. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten that, you see. Coming back to life ... It hurts.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, understanding him perfectly. His was a battered soul, and her love ... it must have hit him like gin dashed over an open wound. But he was back here, ready to take more of it, no matter how it pained him inside. Because he was the bravest man on God\u2019s earth.</p><p>And he was hers. All hers, at last. Her heart swelled with joy.</p><p>From the floor, Darryl moaned.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d Rhys growled at him. \u201cGet out, and begone. Unless you want to spend eternity haunting those ruins yourself, you will not let me find you.\u201d</p><p>Still gasping for air, Darryl crawled toward the ladder on his belly. At a painfully slow rate, he disappeared from the loft. A dull thud suggested he\u2019d taken the last few rungs the hard way. At last, they heard the door swing on its hinges.</p><p>When Meredith and Rhys were finally alone, he turned to her. His brow furrowed with concentration.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cI have to say that, before anything else. Because it\u2019s the most important thing. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Dear, dear man. He spoke the words as though they were some sort of damning verdict on her life. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to hear it.\u201d</p><p>He heaved a sigh of obvious relief. He ambled his way across the room to her, looking around the loft. \u201cYou\u2019re hanging curtains?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, sliding her scissors onto the windowsill. \u201cThe lace you bought in Bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty.\u201d</p><p>He stopped next to the window and surveyed the view over her shoulder. So close to her, but not touching yet. Her breathing came quick, and her heart began to pound. Every inch of her tingled with anticipation.</p><p>He said casually, \u201cI think this would be an ideal nook for a dressing table. Little chair, a mirror.\u201d His big hands outlined a square in the empty space. Oh, how she wanted those hands on her. \u201cYour silver hairbrush set can go right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight next to your shaving kit.\u201d</p><p>His big hand reached for hers. She looked up into warm brown eyes brimming with emotion.</p><p>\u201cMerry.\u201d</p><p>Her heart swelled as he finally pulled her into his arms. Just where she wanted to be. He inclined his head until his whiskered chin grazed her temple. And they stood there together, just breathing. The moment was too intense for a kiss, too profound for words. The relief, the joy, the sheer rightness of it all.</p><p>She pressed her forehead to his frayed lapel and the wall of muscle beneath. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come back,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI just knew it.\u201d</p><p>His hands framed her waist, and he pulled her back to look at him. \u201cThought you didn\u2019t believe in fate or destiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t. But I believe in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His throat worked as he stared deep into her eyes. \u201cBecause fate be damned. God and the Devil and every one of their minions could convene right here and now to drag me off to my doom, and I\u2019d fight my way through each and every one of them to stay with you. Not because it\u2019s my destiny or my punishment or for lack of alternatives, but because I love you too much to be anywhere else. And if you refuse to marry me, I\u2019ll remain here still. Come down to the inn every night for a meal and a pint, just to look at you and be near you. I ...\u201d He brushed the hair back from her face, cupping her cheek in his weathered hand. \u201cMerry, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Rhys. I\u2014\u201d She hesitated, searching his eyes. \u201cCan you bear it if ...?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. I\u2019ve loved you for so long.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed briefly, then opened again. \u201cStill hurts a bit. But it\u2019s getting better.\u201d His thumb brushed her cheek. \u201cAs I recall, you still owe me an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me of the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me?\u201d</p><p>She pretended to think on it. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They smiled at one another. After all that time and all that discussion ... yes, it really was that simple. Because it just felt right.</p><p>In a sudden burst of strength, he grasped her by the waist and tossed her into the air as if she weighed nothing. He caught her just under the hips, holding her fast to his chest and making her the taller of the two. Which gave her the immense joy of staring down at his wide, rugged smile. And then the very great pleasure of bending her head by slow, teasing degrees ... until she finally kissed it away.</p><p>How she loved this man. Theirs would never be a soft, gentle kind of affection. They were both made of granite, chipped off this moor, and their love would be fierce and stubborn and even painful when they clashed. But also solid and enduring. A love to last for all time.</p><p>Finally setting her on her feet, he pressed his brow to hers. \u201cHave I thanked you for saving me?\u201d</p><p>Eyes still closed, she shook her head no.</p><p>\u201cWell, then. I\u2019ll be certain to do that. Every day, for the rest of our lives.\u201d He kissed her brow. \u201cI\u2019m a broken man, Merry. I can\u2019t lie to you. It may take some time before I\u2019m truly whole, and even then, the pieces may never come together quite right. But I\u2019m grateful to you. Grateful for you. And I love you, more than I have words or strength to express. I will never leave your side again.\u201d</p><p>She threw her arms around his neck and pulled him close. \u201cEven if you tried, I wouldn\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><p>Sweet promises, both. But they didn\u2019t last long.</p><p>Rhys did leave her side, the very next morning. And Meredith gladly let him go, for the errand was one of some urgency. Rhys rode to Lydford and made a swift return, curate in tow. It wasn\u2019t the first Sunday of the month, but it was a Sunday. Therefore, Rhys had decided it would be their wedding day. Meredith was not inclined to argue. Their tiny village church hadn\u2019t seen an Evening Prayer service in years, but it saw one that night. By candlelight, no less. Flickering tapers warmed each amber and red stained-glass window. The reading of the banns was followed by a marriage rite, with the entire population of Buckleigh-in-the-Moor in attendance. The groom wore immaculate black and white; the bride, a veil of Bath lace. Bellamy and Cora stood up as witnesses. George Lane looked on with pride.</p><p>And everyone\u2014at least, everyone Cora could nudge into agreement\u2014declared the scene to be the picture of romance.</p><p>Afterward they adjourned for dancing and merriment in the tavern. There, surrounded by increasingly tipsy well-wishers, Meredith laced her fingers behind her husband\u2019s neck as they danced some approximation of a waltz.</p><p>\u201cLady Ashworth,\u201d he said in a tone of mock formality, \u201cyou look uncommonly lovely tonight.\u201d He pulled her close and nuzzled her ear. \u201cGod, it\u2019s good to finally call you that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to finally hear.\u201d She smiled. She\u2019d been waiting for those words a great deal longer than he had. Since her twelfth summer, truth be told. Now she was here in his arms. His wife.</p><p>\u201cWhen can we leave?\u201d His tongue grazed her earlobe. \u201cI want to take you home.\u201d</p><p>The word sent a pleasant shiver down her spine. The cottage wasn\u2019t much of a home yet. No furniture or fixtures. The curtains still weren\u2019t done. But she\u2019d seen to the essentials that afternoon\u2014a mattress, blankets, a few bottles of wine, and a healthy stack of peat for the fire. That was all they\u2019d need tonight.</p> <p>\u201cSoon,\u201d she said, pulling back. \u201cBut first ... I want to talk about the inn.\u201d</p><p>He concealed any irritation and gave her a patient smile. \u201cWhat about the inn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a chat with Gideon while you were away.\u201d</p><p>His smile faded. \u201cOh, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants an honest life now, a family. With Cora.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I gathered.\u201d</p><p>She looked to the bar, where the younger couple were working together to serve drinks. \u201cThey\u2019re sweet together, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d Rhys shrugged, as though to say a big, strong man like him couldn\u2019t possibly know a thing about sweetness.</p><p>Meredith smiled. She knew very well he did, but she wouldn\u2019t force him to admit it. \u201cTake my word for it, then. They\u2019re sweet. And my money says they\u2019ll be married by Christmas. Gideon\u2019s going to clear out your cellar and use that as a down payment on the Three Hounds.\u201d At the slight wrinkling of Rhys\u2019s forehead, she sped up her speech. \u201cHe and Cora will manage the place, under my supervision at first. We\u2019ll pay them with increasing shares of the inn, until they own it outright. Please say you\u2019ll agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll agree to whatever you like, but ...\u201d His frown deepened. \u201cDo you really mean to give up the inn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I really mean to sell it, at a profit.\u201d Smiling, she brought her hand to his face, rubbing her thumb along his lower lip. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s best for the village.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re what\u2019s best for me. Truly, Rhys. I\u2019m ready to build a future with you.\u201d</p><p>She pressed a light kiss to his lips, and when she moved to retreat, he caught her, making that light kiss something dark, passionate. Deeply arousing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re parting with the inn,\u201d he said at length. \u201cBecause I have a new project for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Nethermoor Hall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I\u2019m willing to bet you\u2019re already full of clever ideas for it.\u201d</p><p>She bit back a grin. She did have a few.</p><p>\u201cI knew it. You\u2019re the most resourceful woman in England.\u201d He lifted his gaze, and a chuckle rumbled from his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that first night, when I stood in that door\u201d\u2014he tilted his head toward the entrance\u2014\u201cand watched you smash that bottle of claret over Harold Symmonds\u2019s head.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed at the memory. \u201cFell like a stone, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fell harder. Knew right then you were the only one for me.\u201d He pulled her hand from his face, kissed her palm, then pressed it flat against his chest. \u201cI know I don\u2019t have to tell you, I\u2019ve seen a lot of unpleasantness in my life. Suffered a good many wounds, and a great deal of pain. But through it all, this heart kept beating. Do you feel it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His heartbeat thumped against her palm. Steady and strong, as ever.</p><p>\u201cBeatings, battles, fights. No matter how bleak the circumstance, no matter how my soul despaired ... this heart never once gave up.\u201d His voice deepened, went thick with emotion. \u201cI\u2019ve a theory as to why. Do you want to hear it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThis heart is yours.\u201d</p><p>Words failed her. Tears would have to do. Just a few tears now, then kisses all night long. Followed by a lifetime of passion and tender love. This was just the happy beginning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt always will be.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
