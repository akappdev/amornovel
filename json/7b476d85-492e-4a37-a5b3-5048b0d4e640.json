Killing, yeah, that was a possibility, but not dying.</p><p>Fire exploded in the night. A white-hot mountain of flames burned right through the roof of the old three-story antebellum house on Francis Street and shot toward the sky, its greedy claws a bright orange in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch.\u201d The breath of the flames scorched Zane\u2019s skin. This was supposed to have been an easy collar. Go in, knock out the demon waiting inside, claim his bounty. A simple night\u2019s work for a Night Watch hunter. After the collar, he\u2019d planned to get a beer and maybe a fuck.</p> <p>He took off his jacket and tossed it onto the ground. No sense getting ash on it.</p><p>A scream burst from inside the house. He stilled at the sound because that-that was a woman\u2019s scream. And his prey was male.</p><p>Victim inside. Not just the killer he wanted, but maybe an innocent trapped in that inferno, too.</p><p>Shit. It really was a piss-poor night. He took a breath, squared his shoulders, and knew that he had to go into that damn house. Sometimes, it just sucked to be him.</p><p>Zane raced forward even as the windows of the antebellum exploded, sending glass raining down on him. One kick and he knocked down the front door. Smoke rose, a thick gray fog. The flames crackled, and the house fell around him.</p> <p>\u201cJacobson!\u201d He yelled the bastard\u2019s name. Henry Jacobson. A demon who\u2019d been hunting and killing for the vampires in Baton Rouge. A vamp\u2019s bitch. Seriously, what was worse? \u201cJacobson, where are you?\u201d The smoke stung his nose and made his eyes water as he thundered through the rooms, searching through the smoke and flames.</p><p>Another scream. He ran for the stairs, a long, curving staircase that ended in fire and fury. Someone was on the steps. He saw a shadow in the smoke, someone hunched over, holding tight to the railing.</p><p>Too small to be his prey.</p><p>Victim. Had Jacobson been getting ready for another kill?</p><p>Zane took the stairs three at a time. Chunks of the ceiling fell, hitting close to him, and the heat scorched his skin. He coughed, choking on the smoke that thickened the air.</p><p>Zane reached out and grabbed-</p> <p>\u201cHelp me!\u201d Desperate blue eyes met his. Wide and dark. So dark. They reflected the flames and her fear.</p><p>The woman-small, curvy, shaking-threw her body against his and held on with all her strength. \u201cK-kill ... m-me ... he was ... g-gonna ...\u201d She broke off, coughing, choking, just like him.</p><p>The roof groaned above them, a long, low rumble that couldn\u2019t be a good sign. He glanced up and saw the cracks and rolling fire in what was left of the ceiling. Fuck.</p><p>\u201cH-help ... m-me ...\u201d She shuddered again, her body rubbing against his.</p><p>The devil could take Jacobson. Zane grabbed the woman, lifting her high into his arms. He held her close against his chest and ran back down the stairs. The flames were everywhere. The fire was so damn hot that for an instant, he thought about death.</p><p>Nah, not fucking tonight.</p><p>He concentrated, calling up the power that lurked inside of him, the darkness that was never far away, and those flames didn\u2019t touch him. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>The woman\u2019s lips pressed against the base of his throat. Soft lips. A delicate touch in hell.</p> <p>For an instant, one reckless instant, his concentration wavered and those flames surged forward.</p><p>Cursing, he dove for the door. They flew into the night, and he turned his body, protecting hers, as they slammed onto the porch. Sirens wailed. The cavalry was coming. Always a bit late in this town.</p><p>Her fingers fluttered on his face. \u201cAre you\u201d-a cough- \u201cokay?\u201d A light voice, Southern and soft. Husky. She\u2019d raised her body up, and now she peered at his face with worry in those big, bedroom eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer at first. Just stared at her. The woman was something else. Her skin was a pale ivory, but her high cheekbones and her straight, sharp nose were currently stained with soot. Her lips-damn-were full, sexy. The kind of lips a man fantasized about. A lot. And she had a thick, tumbling mass of black hair. Hair that made her skin look even paler.</p><p>\u201cYou saved me.\u201d She shook her head, sending those long locks swaying. \u201cTh-thank you.\u201d</p><p>A crash shook the house. \u201cBaby, I haven\u2019t saved our asses yet,\u201d he said. Then Zane grabbed her and hauled her to her feet. This was no place for a pit stop. They shot down the curving porch steps, running fast from those flames.</p><p>Jacobson.</p><p>He pushed her behind the gate at the edge of the drive. He coughed again, hard and long, clearing the smoke from his lungs. A fire truck roared up the street, finally getting close now. He held her arms, staring into those fuck-me eyes. \u201cWas someone else inside? Did you see-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I think he wanted ... to kill ... me.\u201d Whispered. Her gaze fell to his throat. \u201cH-he tried to bite me....\u201d</p><p>And he noticed her throat then. The red marks. The teeth marks. As far as he knew, Jacobson wasn\u2019t a vamp, not yet anyway. Zane didn\u2019t see the tell-tale bloodsucker puncture wounds on the woman\u2019s neck. No vamp bite. But something was going on with the guy. Maybe Jacobson had been stealing some vamp blood, and he\u2019d started to become addicted.</p><p>Vamp\u2019s bitch.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>The fire truck slammed to a halt in front of the house.</p><p>She shook her head as her gaze slowly rose to once again meet his. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know. ... I shoved him back, we fought... then-then everything just exploded.\u201d Her voice dropped when she said, \u201cHe\u2019s still up there.\u201d</p><p>Firefighters ran past them, pulling hoses with them. Zane\u2019s jaw clenched as he turned away from her. He should go-</p><p>\u201cHow ... how can I thank you?\u201d</p><p>Now that voice was pure sex. His head turned back to hers, real slowly.</p><p>She licked her lips, a fast swipe of a small pink tongue. \u201cI would have died without you.\u201d She pressed closer to him. \u201cYou came into that fire.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything-you were like an angel.\u201d</p><p>Oh, the sexy woman was so confused. \u201cNot quite, baby.\u201d More like the devil. His gaze lingered on those full lips. Definitely not an angel.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d A hard masculine bark.</p><p>Sighing, Zane glanced over his shoulder and saw one of the firefighters lumbering toward him. \u201cIs anyone still inside?\u201d the guy demanded.</p><p>\u201cUp-upstairs ...\u201d the woman whispered, and they all looked at the flames.</p><p>The house seemed to collapse. Groans and shrieks filled the air, and the rest of the roof tumbled down, smashing right through the upper floors.</p><p>Firefighters scrambled back.</p><p>\u201cNot fucking alive now,\u201d the firefighter muttered as he turned away. \u201cDammit!\u201d</p><p>If the man inside was human, no, he\u2019d definitely be dead.</p><p>But the firefighters weren\u2019t just dealing with a human. If only. And they\u2019d need Zane if they were going to get that fire settled down. Lucky for them, he had a way with flames.</p><p>Like most demons, he could control the elements, and fire was his bitch.</p><p>But first...</p><p>There was the little matter of a thank-you.</p><p>Zane wrapped an arm around the woman\u2019s waist. He tipped back her chin with his left hand. Her lips parted in surprise and she said, \u201cWhat-\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. Caught her with her mouth open and drove his tongue inside that sweet heat. And, oh, but she was sweet. His tongue tasted her, stroked her, and he held her tightly against his body, loving the feel of those soft curves crushed against him. A moan rose in her throat, and her hands tightened around his shoulders.</p><p>His little victim didn\u2019t push him away. No, she tried to pull him closer.</p><p>My kind of woman.</p><p>And if those flames weren\u2019t waiting, he\u2019d show her just how she could truly thank him. No time now. But maybe later.</p><p>One last lick. One last stroke of his tongue. Then Zane forced his head to lift. Her eyes were closed, and her expression a bit dazed. Her lips were red now, heated from his mouth.</p><p>He released her and stepped back.</p><p>Her eyelashes lifted, and she blinked. Once. Twice.</p><p>\u201cTold you I wasn\u2019t an angel, baby.\u201d He let a grin curve his lips. \u201cBut if you want to show me how much you appreciate my help just stick around a while.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. He almost laughed. Almost ... but his cock was shoving hard against his jeans, and the firefighters were losing their battle with the flames. They needed him.</p><p>So he turned away from her and didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>\u201cMiss? Miss, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Jana Carter hunched her shoulders at the voice. More vehicles had arrived. Cops. An ambulance. She glanced to the right and found a fresh-faced EMT staring at her.</p><p>\u201cWere you burned?\u201d he asked her quietly, compassion flowing with the words.</p><p>She let her lips tremble. \u201cN-no.\u201d Her \u201chero\u201d had disappeared. Had tall, dark, and dangerous really gone back inside the house? To save a killer?</p><p>Stupid move. His funeral.</p><p>Two cops began to approach her. Time to leave. Jana pressed her lips together and realized she still tasted the man on her mouth. Zane Wynter. Bounty hunter extraordinaire. Yes, she knew who he was. Zane\u2019s mistake was not knowing her identity. He should have been better prepared.</p><p>Weren\u2019t the Night Watch hunters always supposed to be prepared? Like freaking Boy Scouts? Night Watch ... the multistate bounty hunting agency had a reputation for always getting the job done. Whether the agents were chasing the worst human criminals out there-or stalking the Other who\u2019d crossed the line, they brought down their prey.</p><p>Most humans didn\u2019t know about the Other in the world. They didn\u2019t know about the vampires, the demons, the shifters, and the hundreds of other monsters out there on the streets. They didn\u2019t know because they were blind.</p><p>Jana wasn\u2019t blind. She knew the real score in this world. And she knew that her \u201chero\u201d hadn\u2019t been an average hunter, either. No, a man hadn\u2019t hauled her out of the flames. A demon had.</p><p>Angel, my ass. She\u2019d almost choked when she told him that one.</p><p>\u201cMiss, I need you to get in the ambulance. I want to check you out.\u201d</p><p>Ah, now that sounded promising. The ride in the ambulance would let her get away from the cops. Because those boys in blue were already eyeing her with too much curiosity and she really didn\u2019t want to get into an explanation of just why she\u2019d been in the house on Francis Street.</p><p>Jana\u2019s knees buckled. The EMT grabbed her, and she let her lashes sag. \u201cSo ... weak.\u201d Though she\u2019d rarely been weak in her life. Appearances could be so deceptive, but the EMT didn\u2019t realize that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d He scooped her up and yelled for help. Seconds later, he was loading her into the back of the ambulance. The doors slammed shut behind them, and the cops were left out in the cold.</p><p>Well, with the cold-and with the flames.</p><p>The ambulance\u2019s siren screamed on and when the vehicle lurched forward, Jana smiled.</p><p>Too easy.</p><p>Or maybe she was just too good because Jana had just taken out her prey, destroyed the evidence, and even been given a getaway car. A chauffeured ride away from the scene of her attack.</p><p>Not bad for a night\u2019s work.</p><p>Poor Zane. The guy obviously thought he was the big, tough demon badass. He\u2019d be realizing soon enough that there was a new sheriff in town.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get the demon.\u201d Zane rubbed the back of his neck, felt every ache and pain in his body, and met the stare of his boss, Jason Pak, head-on. \u201cWhen I got to the house on Francis Street, the place was a damn inferno.\u201d The flames had spread so quickly that the firefighters thought accelerants must have been used to soak the place.</p><p>Everything just exploded. The woman\u2019s voice whispered through his head. Yeah, the house had exploded all right. With a little help.</p><p>He exhaled and dropped his hand. \u201cThe bastard had a victim with him. He was still hunting.\u201d Not just hunting, but acting like a vamp. Trying to bite prey. No longer slicing them with claws and knives, but biting, vamp style. What the hell? \u201cShe was lucky to get out alive.\u201d</p><p>Pak\u2019s leather chair creaked as the owner of Night Watch leaned forward and flattened his palms on the desk. \u201cWas she?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s shoulders straightened a bit. \u201cI pulled her out of the flames.\u201d That good deed had to be worth something, right? No matter what most folks thought, he didn\u2019t spend his whole life telling the world to screw off.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Pak\u2019s fingers drummed on the desktop. There was a skeletal staff in the Night Watch office then. Most of the bounty hunters were out on cases. Dragging in prey.</p><p>Pity. This time, Zane wouldn\u2019t have any prey to bring in.</p><p>\u201cThe EMTs took her to the hospital,\u201d he told Pak. \u201cShe\u2019d sucked in a lot of smoke, and that jerk-off Jacobson bit her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny other injuries?\u201d Pak\u2019s dark gaze was steady.</p><p>\u201cUh, no. None that I saw.\u201d He hadn\u2019t smelled blood on her, but the smoke had been clogging his nose. He didn\u2019t think the woman had been hurt. But she\u2019d trembled against him.</p><p>Desire? Fear? Or pain? \u201cWhat did she look like?\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked at that. \u201cAh ... pretty. About five-foot-four, curvy, black hair, blue eyes-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould have changed her appearance,\u201d Pak murmured and his fingers stopped tapping.</p><p>And Zane got a really bad feeling in his gut. \u201cUh, excuse me?\u201d</p><p>Pak\u2019s black brows shot up. \u201cDid I ever tell you I thought you handled yourself damn well when all that shit went down with Dee?\u201d</p><p>Dee. Dee Daniels was another bounty hunter in the office. She\u2019d watched his ass, he\u2019d watched hers, for years. He\u2019d trusted the woman with his life more times than he could count. Then she\u2019d become a vampire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do my job,\u201d Zane said quietly. Just like he\u2019d done his job when Dee changed. He\u2019d protected her and made sure the assholes after her were taken down. \u201cNo matter what happens, I do my job. \u201c</p><p>Pak rose and walked around the edge of the desk. A ghost of a smile curved his thin lips. \u201cGood. You know the job has to come first.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? The job always came first for him. Zane sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cJacobson\u2019s body wasn\u2019t recovered on the scene. The fire department was still there when I left, digging through the rubble, but-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t think they\u2019ll find a body? Or what\u2019s left of one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacobson was a demon.\u201d Demons and fire always mixed. \u201cThe guy was low level, but he should have been strong enough to knock the flames back, at least for a few moments.\u201d A few moments would have been all the guy needed for an escape.</p><p>\u201cYou want to keep searching for him.\u201d</p><p>Hell, yeah. \u201cHe\u2019s my collar.\u201d</p><p>Pak didn\u2019t blink. That dark stare just weighed him.</p> <p>\u201cUh, boss?\u201d Pak didn\u2019t usually get all quiet and focused like this unless he was out in the swamps, talking to the gators. The guy was a charmer, a being born with the ability to speak to animals. On the weekends, Pak would spend hours with the twelve- to fourteen-foot gators that loved to snap and feast in those muddy waters.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to give Jude the Jacobson case,\u201d Pak said.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude can go back to Francis Street. If Jacobson got away, he\u2019ll catch the guy\u2019s scent.\u201d</p><p>Jude Donovan was good at catching scents. But then, Jude was a white tiger shifter, so he\u2019d fucking better be good at sniffing.</p><p>Zane locked his muscles. \u201cJude\u2019s good at tracking, but so am I, and you know I don\u2019t stop on a case until I\u2019ve got my prey.\u201d Especially not if the prey was a demon. He always brought the demons down. Or put them down, depending on the case.</p> <p>\u201cJude\u2019s got Jacobson,\u201d Pak said, staring up at him. Fuck. Every muscle in Zane\u2019s body tightened and his hands clenched.</p><p>\u201cBecause I need you on something more important,\u201d Pak told him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Pak shook his head. \u201cYou can take the fire, Jude can\u2019t. That means he can\u2019t take her.\u201d</p><p>Her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think an accelerant was used on Francis Street,\u201d Pak said, \u201cJust like no accelerant was used three nights ago at the fire on Biltmore that took out two vampires, or at the three fires in New Orleans that occurred over the last few months.... Fires all aimed at supernaturals.\u201d</p><p>Okay, Pak sure had Zane\u2019s attention. Someone was targeting supernaturals?</p><p>\u201cThey were aimed at the Other, but it looks like humans were caught in the crossfire. Two human scientists died.\u201d</p><p>Hell.</p> <p>\u201c \u2018Course, the arson investigators think an accelerant was used because those fires burned so fast and so hot.\u201d Pak reached behind him and scooped a manila file off the top of the desk. \u201cA woman was spotted at the crime scenes. Average height. About one-hundred-thirty pounds.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s gut clenched.</p><p>\u201cWitnesses saw a blonde, with curly hair, running from the other fires.\u201d</p><p>Blonde. Maybe she changed her appearance. Now he knew what Pak meant. \u201cThe woman tonight was a victim. \u201c</p><p>Pak stared back at him, that dark stare unblinking. \u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p><p>Too much doubt was in Pak\u2019s voice, and Zane realized that no, he wasn\u2019t sure. In this world, you couldn\u2019t be sure of anything or anyone. Damn. He might have been played. Jaw clenched, Zane demanded, \u201cJust what am I dealing with here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m right, the woman you\u2019re looking for is a human with a very special gift. A gift of fire.\u201d</p><p>Shit. An Ignitor. A human who could create fire from nothing, who could let it burn fiery hot and so very fast. A human who could destroy too much.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had experience dealing with Ignitors,\u201d Pak said.</p><p>Zane\u2019s head jerked in agreement. Not the best experience.</p><p>\u201cI want you to find this one. Find her, and bring her in.\u201d The briefest of hesitations. \u201cIf the woman from tonight isn\u2019t the one we need, clear her, and move on. But I expect to have the Ignitor who is making these fires contained within the next forty-eight hours.\u201d</p><p>Well, it would be easy enough to find the dark-haired beauty with the bedroom eyes. The EMTs had taken her in. She\u2019d still be at the hospital now.</p><p>Unless she ran. Unless she wasn\u2019t the victim. Unless she screwed me.</p><p>Zane forced his hands to unclench. \u201cSometimes Ignitors can be hard to contain.\u201d He paused, because the question had to be asked. \u201cIs this a kill mission?\u201d With Ignitors, there wasn\u2019t always a choice. If the fire raged too hot...</p><p>Kill or be killed.</p><p>\u201cWe want her alive,\u201d Pak said. Then the cagey bastard added, \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>How long did it take to bandage a bite mark? Jeez, it wasn\u2019t like the demon had even broken the skin. After two hours- two freaking hours-Jana managed to slip away from the nurses and the docs in their garish green uniforms. She snuck out of the hospital\u2019s exit, making sure she stayed in the shadows, and she hurried down the street as quickly as she could.</p><p>It took her about two minutes to realize that she was being trailed. Bad, bad mistake. She should have realized that fact in about thirty seconds.</p><p>Must be slipping.</p><p>Jana rolled her shoulders, trying to keep her body loose. In this town, she knew she had to be ready for anything. Sure, the majority of women would probably worry about muggers waiting in the night. She knew she was more likely to be attacked by a hungry vamp or a pissed-off demon.</p><p>No, Jacobson\u2019s dead. No way did he get out.</p><p>She hoped.</p><p>Okay. There were two ways to play this. She could attack with guns blazing or ...</p><p>Jana stepped out of the shadows. \u201cI-I ... is someone there?\u201d She let her voice tremble. Playing weak came so naturally to her. She looked weak. Small. Fragile. All the better to lie.</p><p>No one answered her. Her eyes narrowed. Time to hit the main street and get off this quiet lane. She could hail a cab and be back at her place in half an hour.</p><p>The wind blew against her face, a cold, icy wind, and for an instant, she caught the smell of ... ash.</p><p>Her body stiffened. Oh, hell, no. That job was finished. She inched back, her gaze darting around the area. She couldn\u2019t risk being taken down.</p><p>Jana started heading for the main street. A cab would come along, it had to. And if it didn\u2019t ...</p><p>A hand snaked out and grabbed her wrist. She screamed because that was what she should do.</p><p>\u201cRelax, baby. It\u2019s just me.\u201d Zane gave her a shark\u2019s smile, one with lots of sharp, white teeth. \u201cYour knight in shining armor.\u201d</p><p>Only he didn\u2019t look particularly knightlike then. The guy was a big, strong menace in the darkness. She knew just how dangerous he was.</p><p>\u201cWere you following me?\u201d she whispered and stepped closer to him. Damn, but the guy had some broad shoulders. And a wide, muscled chest.</p><p>He was handsome, in a rough, wild kind of way. Dark hair and brows, long, slightly twisted nose, lips a little thin, jaw perfectly square and strong. His eyes were dark shadows now, but she knew his piercing gaze was green. She\u2019d seen his picture long before she met him at the fire. She always studied pictures of her targets. After all, a woman had to make sure she was going after the right mark.</p><p>\u201cFollowing you?\u201d His voice was deep, rumbling, and a shiver worked over her body. From the cold because she didn\u2019t do so well with the cold, and not because she found that rumble sexy.</p><p>She glanced back over her shoulder. \u201cI thought I heard ...\u201d Jana shook her head and forced her own smile as she looked back at him. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>But she knew he was watching her. Weighing her. Trying to see past her skin.</p><p>\u201cLet me take you home,\u201d he said.</p><p>If you want to show me how much you appreciate my help just stick around a while.</p><p>Her chin rose. Was sex on the demon\u2019s mind? Or was it something more?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJana.\u201d The name was safe enough. \u201cJana Carter.\u201d She paused and shivered again. Damn. \u201cI\u2019m Zane Wynter.\u201d</p><p>Right. Zane Wynter, super hunter. Demon badass. Check. \u201cYou did follow me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, I just got here. I saw you walking....\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI was checking up on you. I wanted to see if you were okay.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Sweet. Also ... lie.</p><p>She put her hands on his chest. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Good thing she knew how to play the game. \u201c No, bitch, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Hell, she knew that voice. Jana\u2019s head whipped around, and she locked eyes on Henry Jacobson. Crap-the jerk had made it out of the fire.</p><p>Well, mostly, anyway. He stepped under a flickering streetlight, and she saw that deep, red blisters covered the right half of his face. Blisters that stretched and twisted down his neck. His shirt had melted, merging with the skin on his chest and the stench of burned flesh filled her nose.</p><p>Knew I smelled ash.</p><p>She gasped dramatically and shoved her body against Zane\u2019s. The big hero would save her, right?</p><p>\u201cJacobson.\u201d Fury vibrated in Zane\u2019s voice.</p><p>Jacobson, no, Henry-'cause, yeah, he\u2019d asked her to call him by his first name when he\u2019d picked her up at that low-class bar-snarled. His eyes were pitch black, the perfect black of a demon\u2019s true gaze. Most demons used the magic of glamour to hide their real eye color so the humans wouldn\u2019t run screaming all the time. Henry wasn\u2019t trying to pretend right then, not trying to lull her like he\u2019d done before.</p><p>The man wanted blood-hers. Too bad for him ... she was rather fond of living.</p><p>\u201cGive me the bitch,\u201d Henry growled. \u201cAnd just walk the fuck away.\u201d</p><p>Oh, um, no, that wouldn\u2019t work so much as a plan.</p><p>Zane grabbed her hands, held tight, then shoved her at Jacobson. She staggered to a quick halt a few feet in front of Zane.</p><p>What the hell? Zane was supposed to be the damn good guy.</p><p>She blinked and shook her head. Not part of the plan.</p><p>\u201cYou want her?\u201d Zane drawled. \u201cThen come and get her.\u201d</p><p>What? Asshole. Was he using her as some kind of freaking bait? She was not good bait.</p><p>Jacobson launched right at her, running hard and fast with his hands out, with death in his eyes, and she knew if he touched her, he\u2019d rip her apart.</p><p>Dammit. She didn\u2019t plan on dying. Not then, and certainly not by some low-budget demon jerk\u2019s hand.</p><p>Jana yanked out the scalpel she\u2019d stolen from the hospital and screamed as Jacobson\u2019s foul stench choked her.</p><p>Not. Dying. Tonight.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>The woman-Jana-sliced Jacobson right across his injured arm. A hard, deep slice that had the demon howling ... and Zane swearing.</p><p>Not an Ignitor. Pak was wrong-this woman couldn\u2019t stir fire. Shit, if she could, she\u2019d be burning Jacobson to ash, not screaming and stabbing with-what was that?-a scalpel. Innocent.</p><p>And he had one rule. Just one. On his watch, no innocent woman would ever be hurt while he was there.</p><p>So when Jacobson knocked the scalpel out of her hands, and Jana stumbled back, Zane lunged forward and did what he\u2019d been dying to do all night.</p><p>He got ready to kick some demon ass.</p><p>Zane caught Jacobson\u2019s hand, squeezed hard and heard the demon\u2019s breath whoosh out when the bones crunched. \u201cGet behind me,\u201d Zane ordered, and Jana rushed, nearly tripping as she hurried to obey.</p><p>A human. Small and defenseless. And Jacobson had been ready to kill her.</p><p>\u201cNot your fight,\u201d Jacobson gritted out.</p><p>\u201cAsshole, I\u2019ve been looking for this fight for days.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd if you hadn\u2019t been hiding like the coward you are, I would\u2019ve already kicked the shit out of you.\u201d</p><p>Fear widened Jacobson\u2019s black eyes as he struggled to break free of Zane\u2019s hold. \u201cI just want her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting her.\u201d Playtime was over. He\u2019d run his test on Jana. Seen what he needed to see. Not my target. Time to end the game.</p><p>Then the prick head-butted him. Well, tried to. Zane jerked back, punching out hard at the same time, and Jacobson fell to the ground.</p><p>Footsteps thudded behind him. Jana ... running away. \u201cWait!\u201d His head swung toward her.</p><p>And that asshole demon charged him, grabbing Zane around the waist, and they both went down hard, slamming into the pavement.</p><p>Jana kept running. The thud of her footsteps echoed in Zane\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the bitch,\u201d Jacobson grunted, and oh, damn, but the guy\u2019s face was wrecked. \u201cThe others will get her.\u201d</p><p>What? Others?</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re so bad ... hunting your own kind.\u201d Jacobson plowed a fist into Zane\u2019s face, and Zane took the punch because he wanted the bastard to keep talking. \u201cFucking traitor, want to be human, can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>This time, Zane caught the fist that came at his face. And because the demon had pissed him off, Zane broke two of the guy\u2019s fingers.</p><p>Jacobson howled. Zane squeezed tighter. \u201cWho are the others?\u201d he demanded. He couldn\u2019t see Jana anymore. That woman sure moved fast for a human.</p><p>\u201cL-let...g-go...\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled. \u201cNo.\u201d It was his turn to head-butt. He smashed his forehead into Jacobson\u2019s nose.</p><p>The demon crawled away, gagging as blood flew from his broken nose.</p><p>\u201cSomething you should know,\u201d Zane murmured as he rose to his feet, brushing off his hands. Jacobson was still on the ground, moaning. \u201cI like to fight dirty.\u201d Then he drove his booted foot into Jacobson\u2019s side. Paused. Then did it again. The demon curled into a ball. \u201cNext time, leave the humans alone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBastard!\u201d</p><p>True. But flattery wouldn\u2019t stop him. Where was Jana? Zane risked one moment to let his gaze rake the darkness. That was when he heard her scream.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a naughty girl, Jana.\u201d The angry whisper blew against her ear.</p> <p>Damn the supernaturals in the city. They were everywhere, and it sure seemed like they were all gunning for her. Why was she becoming Ms. Popular?</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she said loudly, really hoping that Zane had caught her scream. And, come on, what had been up with him shoving her at the crazy demon? Hadn\u2019t the guy ever heard of protecting the weak? Hadn\u2019t she looked weak enough for him?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hard woman to track.\u201d The jerk didn\u2019t let her go. He just shoved her up against some smelly alley wall. She couldn\u2019t see his face. Since she was human, she didn\u2019t get bonus vision in the dark. Just a body that could break too easily. And had, too many times.</p><p>\u201cWh-what do you want?\u201d Come on, Zane, haul ass. She didn\u2019t need to see in order to know the identity of the man who\u2019d snuck up on her and now held her in his too cold and too tight grip. She hadn\u2019t planned to meet him tonight. Hadn\u2019t been ready. But she\u2019d known that he was watching. He was one of those pricks who liked to watch while the world went to hell around him.</p><p>\u201cI want to make sure you understand the rules of the game.\u201d Great. He\u2019d pushed her hair to the side and now his breath was on her neck. She really didn\u2019t want this guy\u2019s mouth on her neck. She didn\u2019t want him anywhere near her.</p> <p>If Zane\u2019s not coming, then I can take care of him. I can do it.</p><p>As long as Zane wasn\u2019t there to see....</p><p>Her breath came out on a long, slow rush. \u201cI understand the rules.\u201d He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThen why the hell did you go after my man?\u201d His claws pressed into her chest. Right above her heart.</p><p>Jana stilled, barely daring to breathe because she\u2019d just caught the glint of fangs in the dark. When a vamp\u2019s fangs were that close to your throat\u2014hell. And those claws hurt. He hadn\u2019t shoved them too deep, not yet, but if he wanted, the guy could cut her heart out in less than two seconds\u2019 time.</p><p>I hate vampires.</p> <p>\u201cHow was I supposed to know he was yours?\u201d She started talking, fast, but kept her voice quiet now. \u201cHe\u2019s a demon, I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>A growl. \u201cYou thought wrong. You\u2019re not supposed to attack the demons.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t she? Sometimes, the jobs all ran together.</p><p>\u201cI let you live after you took my men\u2014\u201d</p><p>Right, those two evil, sadistic, murdering bastards had been his men.</p><p>\u201cI tracked you, could have fucking drained you dry, but I let you live.\u201d</p><p>The vamp smelled like a graveyard. Jana tried real hard not to inhale too deeply.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive because I want you to hunt,\u201d he snarled, \u201cand you hunt who I say. I\u2019m the one in charge, bitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJana!\u201d Oh, finally, Zane\u2019s voice. Talk about taking his sweet time.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the prey. The first you\u2019ll take down for me.\u201d The freak licked her neck. Licked her. \u201cAnd I want him to suffer.\u201d</p><p>What? Zane? He wanted her to attack Zane?</p><p>\u201cShow me just what you can do, bitch. Kill him, or die.\u201d</p><p>She nodded weakly. Because, really, what choice did she have?</p><p>He released her, finally moving those claws away from her heart. The wounds he\u2019d made ached, throbbing dully. Her head sagged forward. She inched toward the light. Toward Zane. He was running fast, racing to get to her. \u201cKill him.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at the vampire hiding in the shadows. Jana took two more steps away from him, turning so that she had the best view of his hulking body, and then she smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not still in this town just so I can be your bitch,\u201d she whispered and let the frightened act vanish. The vampire froze, and she knew he\u2019d gotten a good look at her face. Her eyes. \u201cI stayed to take you out.\u201d He\u2019d been her target all along, but she\u2019d missed him that first night. Then he\u2019d gotten the jump on her. Sometimes, a woman had to wait and find her perfect killing time.</p><p>Now.</p><p>And here she\u2019d thought it would be hard to lure the vampire to her. All she\u2019d had to do was light the right fire under his little demon minion, and she\u2019d gotten his personal attention.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He lunged at her.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t in the mood to get her heart torn out right then.</p><p>Zane raced into the alley, his legs pumping, adrenaline powering his blood.</p><p>And he smelled flames.</p><p>Then he saw the fire sputtering near the dumpster. He waved his hand, and the flames quieted.</p><p>\u201cJana?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t there. He crept forward and stared down at the charred remains on the ground. Fuck. The stench stung his nose.</p><p>\u201cJana!\u201d But she was gone, and a hot fury began to burn in his gut because Zane realized that he\u2019d been played. For the second time, he\u2019d been taken in by a pretty, lying face. A face that hid a real monster behind the cloak of innocence.</p><p>He snatched out his phone. Dialed Pak. One ring and his boss picked up. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna need a cleanup crew on Rangeline.\u201d Dammit. Played. \u201cAnd you were right.\u201d He paused a moment, watching the smoke drift in the air. \u201cThe woman\u2019s not a victim.\u201d An Ignitor\u2019s back in town.</p><p>The demon was strapped to the table, his legs and arms secured, and the blood had dried on his face.</p><p>\u201cI thought I told you that Jude would be taking over the Jacobson case.\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged at Pak\u2019s words. \u201cThe bastard came after me. What did you want me to do? Let him walk away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you, asshole!\u201d Jacobson tried to lunge up, but the straps held tight. \u201cI was after her!\u201d</p><p>Zane pulled over a chair and got real close to the demon. Close enough to touch, to hurt. \u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>Jacobson would be transferred out soon enough. Pak had plans for the guy, but first...</p><p>\u201cWhere did you meet the woman?\u201d he pressed. Jana. Was that even her real name? Jude was running a search on her. Maybe the shifter would turn up some intel on the name, but in the meantime-</p><p>Zane was in the mood to get answers from the demon, and he would have those answers, one way or another.</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d Jacobson spat at him.</p><p>Zane blinked. \u201cWrong. Answer.\u201d He drove his fist into Jacobson\u2019s face. Payback could be a bitch.</p><p>\u201cAh ... Zane?\u201d Pak\u2019s voice was completely flat.</p><p>Jacobson spit out a tooth. \u201cYou think ... you\u2019re so much fucking better than the rest ... of us....\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s shoulders tensed.</p><p>Jacobson laughed. A ragged, rough sound. \u201cBut you\u2019re worse.... Under the skin ... you\u2019re worse!\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled at him. \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to see just how much worse I can be.\u201d</p><p>Pak\u2019s arm came down on his shoulder. \u201cZane ...\u201d A slight warning there.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t glance back at him. \u201cThis demon knows about your Ignitor, Pak.\u201d A woman he\u2019d literally had right in his hands-twice-and he\u2019d let her slip away.</p><p>Because he was looking straight at Jacobson, he caught the demon\u2019s flinch. Ah ... \u201cWhere did you meet her, Jacobson?\u201d</p><p>Jacobson\u2019s lips firmed.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Pak demanded.</p><p>\u201cSome damn bar! Bitch came up to me.\u201d His lips twisted, showing his bloodstained teeth. \u201cShe was all over me.\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in Zane\u2019s body locked.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to leave, so I took her to my place. Then she tried to burn me!\u201d</p><p>Tried? Succeeded. Those blisters would take a long time to heal, even with a demon\u2019s enhanced recovery system.</p><p>\u201cIn the last two weeks, you\u2019ve picked up three women from bars in the area,\u201d Pak said, the words so calm he could have been talking about the weather. His hand lifted from Zane\u2019s shoulder, and Pak came to stand at his side. \u201cWe found the body of your first victim. You took her to the vamps, didn\u2019t you? You let them drain her dry.\u201d</p><p>Jacobson stared up at him, his eyes burning with black rage.</p><p>Pak crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cWe haven\u2019t found the second woman yet.\u201d</p><p>The bastard laughed again. Laughed. \u201cYou won\u2019t. There was nothing left of her. Not when the vamps finished.\u201d</p><p>Put him down. Zane knew Jacobson wasn\u2019t one of the demons that would be turned loose one day. You didn\u2019t let a rabid dog back out to hunt.</p><p>\u201cThen you came upon a new lady....\u201d Pak\u2019s voice pitched lower. \u201cOne who was \u2018all over you.'\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was, she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid this woman ask you anything?\u201d Pak cut across his roaring words. \u201cDid she say\u2014\u201d \u201cThe whore just burned me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you got to live,\u201d Zane snapped. \u201cHer last victim wasn\u2019t so lucky.\u201d He grabbed the knife from the sheath on his leg and put the blade right at Jacobson\u2019s throat. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna be lucky much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane ...\u201d Pak\u2019s whisper.</p><p>Jacobson started to smile.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t slice too fast,\u201d Pak continued. \u201cYou want him to feel the pain.\u201d</p><p>Jacobson\u2019s black eyes widened. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>So Jacobson was another one who loved to torture prey, but couldn\u2019t stand pain himself. \u201cWho\u2019d she kill in the alley?\u201d The others will get her. Jacobson knew the guy who\u2019d burned, no doubt.</p><p>Zane let the blade cut through skin.</p><p>\u201cVincent!\u201d Yelled. \u201cShit! I-it was Vincent Gunner! He was with me. There were two humans there, but he-he told \u2018em to stay back, that we could handle her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you couldn\u2019t, could you?\u201d Vincent Gunner. He knew the name. A powerful vampire on Night Watch\u2019s kill list. Gunner had been a cruel asshole who enjoyed slowly bleeding humans dry-women. Only women.</p><p>Had he picked the wrong prey? Or was something more going on here?</p><p>\u201cHey, Wynter!\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s head lifted at Jude Donovan\u2019s call. The shifter stood just inside the doorway of their holding area. Jude clutched some papers in his hand and lifted them toward Zane. \u201cI found your girl.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced back at the demon. The knife still bit into Jacobson\u2019s flesh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll finish him,\u201d Pak said.</p><p>And Zane knew he would. Knew Pak would get every drop of information, and then he\u2019d eliminate the demon\u2019s threat.</p><p>Zane stepped back.</p><p>\u201cI need some help!\u201d Jacobson told the charmer. \u201cGet me a doctor, get me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a demon,\u201d Pak said. \u201cYou\u2019ll heal from just about anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want out, man. I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome folks are waiting on you, Henry.\u201d</p><p>The demon jerked on the table, straining against the straps. \u201cA jail\u2019s not gonna hold me! Nothing can, nothin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you\u2019d be going to jail.\u201d Still no emotion in Pak\u2019s voice. \u201cI just said that folks were waiting on you.\u201d</p><p>Jacobson\u2019s case had been a government deal. Because, yeah, the government knew about the supernaturals out there. They liked to pretend they didn\u2019t, better for the public image that way. But they knew, and they had their own \u201cextermination\u201d list.</p><p>Jacobson was at the top. Some men and women in black would be coming for him soon and, after they picked him up, Jacobson wouldn\u2019t be returning to Baton Rouge again.</p><p>Zane caught Jacobson\u2019s whimper just as he reached Jude\u2019s side. The demon seemed to finally understand. This is the end for you, Jacobson.</p><p>Jude held up the pages, and the first thing Zane saw was ... her.</p><p>No, not Jana. Not exactly. Different hair. Blond. Different eyes. Brown, not blue. Same mouth. Same nose.</p><p>Pak had told him a blonde was seen at the other scenes. So she\u2019d dyed her hair. And he\u2019d found a black-haired lady at Francis Street. \u201cWho is she?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>They left holding, walking back to the Night Watch\u2019s main offices. \u201cShe\u2019s got some aliases,\u201d Jude told him. \u201cKatherine Tanner, Judy Bright, Melissa Jones. But from what I can tell, her real name\u2019s Jana Carter\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jana. Wait, she\u2019d given him her real name?</p><p>\u201cShe was put in a juvenile facility when she was thirteen. She stayed there for five years.\u201d Jude\u2019s bright gaze met his. \u201cApparently, the woman liked to start fires.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cPolice want her for a series of fires in New Orleans,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Zane took the pages and scanned the info. His prey was thirty-one, five-feet-four inches tall, and one hundred-and-thirty-three pounds.</p><p>\u201cHer stepfather died in the fire that landed her in the juvie facility,\u201d Jude continued. \u201cI guess she started young.\u201d</p><p>Looked that way.</p><p>A killer? He\u2019d stared right into her eyes and hadn\u2019t seen what she really was. He was slipping. Or maybe she was just real good at lying.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I can tell, she\u2019s been selling out her services to the, ah ...\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced up at him, eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cHighest bidder for the last few years. If you\u2019ve got a supernatural you want taken down, she\u2019s your girl. Vamps, charmers, low-level demons ... she\u2019s a real equal-opportunity killer.\u201d</p><p>How can I ever thank you?</p><p>Such a sweet, lying mouth. He stared down at the picture again. At her. He\u2019d really thought she might be innocent.</p><p>He kept making the same dumb-ass mistakes.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna be okay on this one?\u201d Jude asked quietly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The office buzzed around them. Phones rang. Voices called out. The fax machine beeped.</p><p>Zane tucked her picture into his back pocket.</p><p>Jude frowned. \u201cLook, I know the last Ignitor case you worked with was\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI handled her, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Zane fired back, breaking through the words.</p><p>Jude\u2019s head moved in the faintest of nods.</p><p>Handled her. Such cool words for the death he\u2019d given the other woman. \u201cI can do my job. I can do what needs to be done.\u201d The same spiel he\u2019d given Pak, but he meant the words. Nothing, no one would stop him.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Pak spoke from behind him, and Zane tensed. \u201cBecause Jacobson gave me a location. He says the woman found him in a dive called Dusk. It\u2019s a new club that opened on St. Antony and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the place,\u201d Zane said, exhaling. Word traveled fast in this town. \u201cIt\u2019s a den.\u201d A demon\u2019s den. The place for his brethren to go in and take their drugs of choice. Darkness rode many of his kind, and the drugs, oh, they tempted.</p> <p>\u201cOh, shit, man, I can take this one,\u201d Jude offered. \u201cI know you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan take on a den any day of the week.\u201d Damn, but he regretted the drunken night he\u2019d made the mistake of spilling his past to the tiger shifter. That guy never forgot anything.</p><p>\u201cThen go get her,\u201d Pak said, \u201cbring her in. No matter what it takes, bring her in. \u201c</p><p>Time to take another killer off the streets.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t go in there.\u201d The husky, very female voice stopped Zane cold just as he prepared to climb the steps leading up to Dusk.</p><p>The voice was laced with a soft drawl, edged with a breath of sex, and it crawled over his body like a caress.</p> <p>A demon shoved past him, heading inside Dusk, and when the door opened, the beat of the music blasted Zane\u2019s ears and the scent of drugs burned his nostrils.</p><p>\u201cOf course, you don\u2019t have to listen to me,\u201d she murmured. Jana. He turned his head a few inches to the right and saw her slide from the darkness. \u201cIt can be your funeral.\u201d</p><p>She looked vulnerable. Small, delicate. Almost helpless as she stood in the shadows with her arms crossed over her chest. Watching him with such big eyes.</p><p>But her words ... \u201cAh ... did you just threaten me?\u201d He moved away from the door. Turned his back on the den and began to stalk her.</p><p>She crept once more toward the shadows and he followed her. His heart rate kicked up. She\u2019s making it too easy.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe this,\u201d she told him, \u201cbut I\u2019m not the threat tonight. Well, not the one you need to be worried about.\u201d</p><p>She was close enough to grab now.</p><p>A soft sigh slipped past her lips as her hands dropped to her sides. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come here. You should\u2019ve just taken the demon in and called it a day.\u201d</p> <p>A shocked laugh broke from his lips, one without a drop of humor. \u201cLady, you killed someone in that alley.\u201d</p><p>She flinched. \u201cThe vampire would have killed me. I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d Her right hand lifted and rubbed against her chest. Thanks to his demon-enhanced senses, he saw the blood on her shirt, and he caught the coppery scent on the wind. \u201cWhat did you want me to do?\u201d she asked, and heat blasted through her words. \u201cJust stand there and let him cut my heart out?\u201d</p><p>A muscle jerked in his jaw.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe I should have waited for you,\u201d she muttered, those sexy eyes narrowing, \u201clike he wanted. I should have waited, and then I should have made sure you were the one who didn\u2019t walk out of that alley.\u201d</p><p>His hands flew out and he caught her, pulling her close and lifting her right off her toes. \u201cDon\u2019t make the mistake of thinking I\u2019m easy to kill.\u201d</p><p>Her chin inched up. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t need to make the mistake of thinking you\u2019re immortal. Everyone can die. Everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d know, wouldn\u2019t you, baby? You kill for the highest bidder.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t blink. Those eyes stayed locked on him, still blue. The fire hadn\u2019t lit within her yet. If it had, her eyes would have been blood-red.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I did to the last Ignitor who came at me with fire in her eyes?\u201d he demanded. Her mouth was temptingly close. He\u2019d kissed that mouth before. Tasted her. Wanted more. Fool.</p><p>A guy\u2019s dick could get him into some serious trouble.</p><p>\u201cDumb ass,\u201d she said, and his eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m not charging up. I\u2019m trying to warn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ... services.\u201d The right side of her mouth kicked up into a hard smile, and damn if a dimple didn\u2019t wink at him. Deceptive package. \u201cWho do you think the number-one target is in this town? Who do you think the demons want taken out? The vamps?\u201d Shit.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You. The vamp in that alley wanted you taken out, and he sure wasn\u2019t the only one to want a fried demon handed to him.\u201d Her gaze darted behind him to Dusk. \u201cThe demons sure don\u2019t like that you\u2019ve been hunting your own kind.\u201d</p><p>Fuck \u2018em. \u201cI don\u2019t hunt them all.\u201d What? Was he defending himself? To her? \u201cJust the ones who cross the line.\u201d His fingers were digging too hard into her arms.</p><p>He took a breath and let her slide back to the ground, let her feet touch down, but he didn\u2019t free her. Wouldn\u2019t. He had plans for Jana Carter.</p><p>\u201cWhat line?\u201d she asked him, shaking her head. \u201cThe one you made up? The one that says some folks are bad, some are good, and smart, all-powerful you gets to punish the ones you think screwed up?\u201d</p><p>He glared at her. Like she could judge him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should let them rip you apart.\u201d Her tongue flashed out to lick her bottom lip.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help it. His stare dipped and followed that fast lick. His body tightened. Damn. He took a breath and swore he tasted her. \u201cIf you\u2019d been smart, you would\u2019ve left town. After you killed the vamp, you should have run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d A shrug. \u201cBut you came into the fire for me.\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d thought she needed him. Thought she was a human who\u2019d needed rescuing. The truth was that the woman could have gotten out of that house without the flames even touching one inch of her perfect skin.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever tried to save me before,\u201d she added. \u201cI thought you were ... sweet.\u201d</p><p>He growled.</p><p>\u201cSo I wanted to even the score.\u201d Another shrug that sent her dark hair settling over her shoulders. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come looking for me. I figured it was only fair to give you a warning.\u201d</p><p>Fair? The woman who torched for a living wanted to talk fair? Zane could only shake his head. \u201cThanks, baby, but believe me, I don\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze slid away from his once more. Back to the club. He caught the whisper of fast-moving feet and the scent of booze and death. Battle-ready tension had his heart slamming into his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d she asked and that same half-smile lifted her lips, making her dimple flash. \u201cOkay. Have it your way, then, stud. Take \u2018em all.\u201d</p><p>He spun around, his eyes zeroing in on the entrance to Dusk. Sure-damn-enough, the demons were snaking out the front door. At least ten of them so far, and their black eyes- filled with fury and hate-were all locked on him.</p><p>Jana\u2019s hand pressed into his back, a warm, sold weight. \u201cHave fun with the fan club,\u201d she said and then her shoes thudded as she ran away.</p><p>Two seconds later, the demons closed in on him.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Jana ran for fifteen seconds. Then ten more. Then, ah, hell, she spun back around.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see Zane anymore. Her big, bad demon was in the middle of a pile of bodies. She heard the thud of flesh, the snarls from the attack, and she knew he was probably on the bottom of that pile.</p><p>\u201cBet you\u2019re wishing you\u2019d taken my help now,\u201d she whispered and clenched her hands into fists as her body began to charge. The air around her warmed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, demon. I pay my debts.\u201d He\u2019d come for her, so she\u2019d be there for him.</p><p>Then ... even. No more debt. Free and clear.</p><p>A demon flew through the air and slammed into the concrete. He didn\u2019t get back up.</p><p>A faint sheen of red fell over her vision, like a mist. Jana marched forward with slow, determined steps. Her breath seemed too loud, too raspy. Her heart felt too slow, and the heat covered her like a blanket.</p><p>\u201cGet away from him!\u201d she called out.</p><p>Another body flew from the mound. One guy, a demon with a long, twisting scar on his right cheek, just turned tail and ran.</p><p>These wouldn\u2019t be the strong demons. Not attacking en masse like this. The weak ones hunted in packs. Especially when they were going after a big kill.</p><p>A knife glinted. \u201cGet away from him!\u201d she screamed the words again and, this time, her voice cut through their fury.</p><p>Three demons turned to look at her.</p><p>So did Zane. He wasn\u2019t on the bottom of the pack. He was still standing. Swinging, knocking back demons and grinning like some kind of madman.</p><p>More demons were running out of Dusk. Like freaking sharks, they could smell blood in the air.</p><p>Soon enough, they\u2019d be smelling fire.</p><p>A smile lifted her lips. The rush of heat had her whole body tensing, her nerves jumping. Nothing like it.</p><p>A line of fire sprang at her feet, then the flames raced for the demons. Their yells and curses filled the air as they faced the new threat.</p><p>The flames flickered, twisted. Ah ... fighting power with power.</p><p>Whenever possible, she avoided the demons. After all, they knew how to play with the elements, and she didn\u2019t like to waste energy pitting her power against theirs. But ...</p><p>These guys were no match for her.</p><p>She fed the flames, and they burned hotter. Two more demons ran away. The door of Dusk slammed shut.</p><p>More yells. More grunts. Zane caught the wrist of the demon with the knife. Zane wrenched down hard, and Jana wondered if he\u2019d broken the man\u2019s wrist. Looked like he had.</p><p>The knife clattered to the ground. She let her flames close in tighter.</p><p>\u201cPull it back!\u201d Zane\u2019s bark.</p><p>The flames were dancing close to him.</p><p>The fire licked a demon. He screamed when the flames lit his clothes and he fell, rolling on the ground to battle the fire.</p><p>\u201cJana!\u201d</p><p>The flames were at Zane\u2019s feet. His gaze met hers over the fire. No fear was in that stare-and it was a completely black stare. With the flames all around him and the bloodlust fueling him, the glamour was finally gone. No more sexy green eyes. Just demon darkness.</p><p>She was looking right at the demon he tried to hide. Tried, failed. She\u2019d seen the demon from the first moment.</p><p>She exhaled, and the flames began to flicker.</p><p>Zane ran through the fire.</p><p>What? \u201cZane!\u201d</p><p>But the flames didn\u2019t burn him. Didn\u2019t even seem to have actually touched him. Then he was in front of her, grabbing her arm, hauling her close, and the heat of the fire pulsed beneath her skin. When his eyes widened, she knew he felt her heat. Warm to the touch, just like a sunburn, but one she\u2019d gotten from the inside out.</p><p>Burn, baby. Burn.</p><p>His eyes were black. She knew the red glow of the charge would still fuel her stare. No lying, no hiding for either of them. Two monsters in the dark.</p><p>She swallowed, but didn\u2019t back down.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were running away,\u201d he said.</p><p>She\u2019d thought so, too. \u201cYou were outnumbered.\u201d And more demons could be coming for him at any minute. They could talk later. \u201cLook, we need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we do.\u201d Then his hands moved, fast, and something clicked around her wrist. Wait-clicked?</p><p>Oh, damn. No, no, he just hadn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe need to get out of here, baby.\u201d Another click.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to her hand. A shining, silver handcuff circled her wrist. Another cuff circled his, locking them together.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t think about burning through it,\u201d Zane warned. \u201cThat metal\u2019s made out of a titanium mix, and it\u2019s got a polymer coating that\u2019ll block you. It\u2019s something special that was designed just for someone like ... you.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth snapped together. \u201cI saved you,\u201d she gritted out, seriously pissed. Is this the way he thanked people?</p><p>But the guy was already moving. Spinning and lunging down the street and jerking her with him. It was either go with him or be dragged behind him. Asshole.</p><p>Yeah, yeah, this was why she didn\u2019t help people. Because when you did something nice, folks had a tendency to bite the hand that helped them.</p><p>Or handcuff it.</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d he ordered. They were beside a car. A flashy red sports car. He had the driver\u2019s door open, and his gaze swept behind her, probably checking to make sure the demons weren\u2019t getting ready for a second round. They weren\u2019t. They were busy licking their wounds. \u201cSlide over to the other seat.\u201d</p><p>So easier said than done. She climbed inside the car. The gearshift rammed into her knees, her ass shot into the air, but she-finally!-made it to the passenger seat.</p><p>He jumped in behind her and shut the door. The engine purred, and they shot away from the curb.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this,\u201d she said and that was not fear tightening her gut. She wasn\u2019t afraid. Nothing scared her, not anymore. She hadn\u2019t been afraid since the day she\u2019d learned how to fight her own monsters. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to you. You can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a bounty on your head, baby. A bounty I\u2019m collecting.\u201d</p><p>The guy didn\u2019t even look at her as he threw that out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes slit. \u201cI\u2019m betting the bounty on you was worth a hell of a lot more.\u201d And she hadn\u2019t taken it. Because she was the crazy one, obviously.</p><p>\u201cOh, and just what am I going for these days?\u201d Not worry in that deep voice. Not even a hint of concern.</p><p>Jana sucked in a deep breath. Then another. Then she tried counting to ten. No, that didn\u2019t work. She was still pissed. \u201cLet me go,\u201d she told him quietly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, it will be the worst mistake you ever make.\u201d Probably the last, too.</p> <p>Now he did glance at her, and his smile was icy. \u201cNo, trust me, it won\u2019t be\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then a semi plowed into the side of his flashy little car. The world spun, glass crunched, and Jana screamed.</p><p>\u201cJust cut off his damn hand.\u201d</p><p>The words drifted through Zane\u2019s mind, easing past the fog, just as he felt something sharp press against his wrist. Cut off his damn hand.</p><p>Oh, the hell, no. His eyelids flew up, and his eyes locked on the dumb punk who had a knife in his fist, a knife that was pressed against Zane\u2019s flesh. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Zane growled.</p> <p>The guy flinched, and his head flew up, revealing wide, bloodshot eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo it, Ron!\u201d The scream of someone who was gonna pay-the other idiot, the one who was holding Zane down on the hard pavement. No, the one who thought he was holding him down. Zane lunged up and sent the guy flying.</p><p>The man with the knife, Ron, scrambled back. \u201cNo, shit, we just want her.\u201d</p><p>Her. Jana. Zane\u2019s gaze cut to the left. She was beside him on the pavement. Since they were still bound by the cuffs, his move had jerked her up. But her eyes hadn\u2019t opened, and she swayed, looking like a broken doll. She was pale, so pale. Her hair concealed half of her face, and her head tipped forward.</p><p>\u201cTake off the cuffs, man,\u201d their would-be knifer said. \u201cJust take \u2018em off and walk away.\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked. \u201cShe\u2019s my bounty.\u201d Was this prick really trying to steal her from him?</p> <p>A soft snick reached his ears. The other idiot was back. Only this time, he had a gun. One that was cocked and ready. His red hair stuck out from his head in thick patches, and his eyes, small and dark, were locked on Zane. \u201cWhat she is,\u201d the guy said, \u201cis a nightmare you don\u2019t want.\u201d</p><p>A soft moan spilled past the nightmare\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cAw, shit, man, she\u2019s waking up,\u201d Ron muttered.</p><p>\u201cHit her.\u201d A fast order from the gunman.</p><p>Ron pulled his fist back and got ready to take that punch. The fuck no.</p><p>Zane let the beast out. One thought, just one ... and he had the asshole with the knife flying back through the air and thudding into the redhead with the gun.</p><p>The gun fired, the bullet went wide, and Zane scooped up Jana. He held her cradled against his chest, barely feeling her weight.</p><p>They were still in the road. A deserted road at three a.m., and his car was a wreck near the broken light post. A trap. Two in one night?</p> <p>But, no, this trap hadn\u2019t been for him this time. For her.</p><p>\u201cJesus, he\u2019s one of them!\u201d the redhead yelled and that gun came up again. Zane pulled his power close, got ready to\u2014</p><p>A line of fire flew at the gunman. He swore and stumbled back, dropping the gun.</p><p>\u201cRun,\u201d Jana whispered in his ear, and he realized the woman was awake-had been awake that whole time. So good at playing weak. Had she just been planning to lie there and let the jerks cut off his hand? Probably. That would have made it easier for her to get away.</p><p>\u201cRun,\u201d she said again, her voice stronger, her breath blowing lightly against his ear. \u201cThey\u2019ll have backup soon.... Too many of them. They\u2019ll take us....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see them fucking try.\u201d He tightened his hold on her as he stared at the wreckage of his car. His baby. Aw, hell. They would pay.</p><p>\u201cThey ... have drugs.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cNot bullets in those guns. Run.\u201d</p><p>Zane heard the snick of the gun\u2019s trigger too late. He lunged to the side. A steel fist slammed into his upper arm, and Zane\u2019s hold on Jana weakened.</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d His head whipped back.</p><p>That bastard still held the gun\u2014and he was getting ready to fire again.</p><p>Zane gathered his power and prepared to blast the asshole once again\u2014but his knees gave way.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jana hit the ground first, thudding hard against the pavement. He sagged behind her. But the woman moved fast. She jumped to her feet, wrenching him with the cuffs, and her flames raced for the two men.</p><p>An engine roared in the distance. Tires squealed.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d No fear in her voice ... but her voice- it sure sounded far away. Weird, when she was standing so close.</p><p>A thick heat began to spread through his blood even as a wave of nausea had Zane sucking in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cGet. Up.\u201d She was yanking at him. Trying to pull him to his feet. \u201cIf you don\u2019t move, they\u2019ll get us both.\u201d Her eyes were glinting in the night. \u201cGet up.\u201d</p><p>He looked at his left arm. Blood trickled from the hole in his shirt. Not bullets in those guns.</p><p>Drugs.</p><p>The beast inside began to claw and scream.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Her nails bit into his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there and let them take us!\u201d</p><p>And he was standing. He\u2019d made it back to his feet. The fire around them rose higher. Higher.</p><p>\u201cRun with me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>With his body already feeling leaden, but his heart beating too fast, he did. Zane knew there wasn\u2019t much time, not long at all depending on the drug they\u2019d given him.</p><p>He could feel the darkness calling to him. The slide had already begun.</p><p>\u201cGot to slow the other cars down ...\u201d</p><p>He saw her eyes narrow for an instant. Then an explosion rocked the night. A roar echoed and rolled down the street.</p><p>Zane managed to turn his head and, oh, hell ... his car was in pieces, burning pieces, and the big rig was covered in flames, too.</p><p>But the flames were blocking the road, and two black SUVs were trapped behind the fire.</p><p>\u201cMove that ass, Wynter!\u201d</p><p>Her voice cut through the drone in his head, and he moved. One foot in front of the other. Move. Move.</p><p>Voices shouted behind them. Doors slammed. Hold it together. Get out of there. Hold it-</p><p>\u201cGet on!\u201d she yelled, pulling at the cuff.</p><p>He blinked. Jana was straddling a motorcycle. A motorcycle that she already had throttling. He climbed on behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to stretch your arm,\u201d she told him. \u201cStretch your right arm and wrap the left one around me so I can hold the handlebars.\u201d</p><p>He stretched. His thighs pressed tight to her as he sealed his body to hers. His left arm throbbed, but he held her as close as he could.</p><p>A hot tension began to slip through his blood. A dull ache blossomed behind his eyes. And that darkness beckoned. So tempting.</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d She gunned the bike. They bolted forward, streaking fast as another steel fist hit his back.</p><p>Sonofabitch. They\u2019d shot him. Again. He hunched his body and tried to protect her as best he could. A chill shook him, a long, hard shudder, and his breath blew against her hair.</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d He heard her shout over the roar of the engine. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>No, no, he wasn\u2019t. His eyes squeezed shut. The drugs were slipping through his body, dragging him slowly down into hell. A hell he\u2019d promised never to visit again. He wasn\u2019t okay, and before he was done with her, before the thing inside was done, Jana wouldn\u2019t be, either.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened? This was supposed to be a simple retrieval mission!\u201d</p><p>Ron stared at his feet, refusing to meet his boss\u2019s stare. Mostly because he knew the boss didn\u2019t like it when folks looked too long at her face, and his eyes did have a tendency to wander. \u201cShe ... ah ... the demon had handcuffed himself to her. We couldn\u2019t get them apart\u2014\u201d He\u2019d waited too long to cut off the bastard\u2019s hand. He swallowed. \u201cBut Ben shot him. The bastard took two tranq shots.\u201d And those shots could take down an elephant. The demon would be out soon, and he\u2019d drag the woman down with him.</p><p>Those cuffs.</p><p>They\u2019d be easy prey once the drugs kicked in.</p><p>\u201cYou dumb sonofabitch.\u201d</p><p>The icy growl had his gaze flying up.</p><p>\u201cYou drugged a demon,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThey don\u2019t react the same way humans do to the tranq. Hell, they never react the same way to anything.\u201d</p><p>Because they were freaks. He licked his lips. The boss held a too-tight grip on her gun. \u201cIt\u2019ll just knock him out. He\u2019ll be a dead weight slowing her down.\u201d Then his job would be easy. Kill the demon. Take the woman.</p><p>The boss lifted her gun and aimed it right at his chest. \u201cIt won\u2019t knock him out. It hasn\u2019t knocked out any demon we\u2019ve tried it on.\u201d</p><p>How was he supposed to know that? \u201cWh-what will it do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will either make him high. It will boost up his power and give him a rush he\u2019s never had. Or ...\u201d</p><p>He gulped. Her finger was tightening around that trigger. Only, her gun was loaded with real bullets.</p><p>\u201cOr it will make the bastard psychotic. He\u2019ll turn on the woman and kill her long before we can get to him.\u201d She stepped closer, her pale blond hair floating around her face. \u201cAnd if that happens, guess who else will be dying?\u201d</p><p>The promise was there, glittering in her dark gaze. His eyes began to dart to her scarred cheek....</p><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s get the hell out of here!\u201d she shouted. There were sirens wailing, coming close now. No way could anyone miss the flames. The cops would swarm any minute.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t be on the scene then. Everyone scrambled inside the two SUVs. The boss shoved him inside with her.</p><p>\u201cGet to Jana Carter\u2019s safe house,\u201d she ordered the driver. \u201cIf she\u2019s running, she\u2019s going to try and disappear.\u201d</p><p>The guy threw the SUV into reverse, and the vehicle spun back. He shifted gears and drove the SUV down the street, easing right past the line of approaching cop cars.</p><p>Jana had to get them off the road. Had to get them someplace safe before the assholes back there came hunting again.</p><p>\u201cAre you with me?\u201d she shouted as the engine growled.</p><p>Zane\u2019s body was pressed close to hers, and he seemed ... heavier.</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d</p><p>His lips were next to her ear. No helmet, not for either of them. If they crashed, even his demon blood wouldn\u2019t save him.</p><p>Nothing would save her.</p><p>Her fingers tightened around the handlebars. \u201cZane?\u201d Shouted louder.</p><p>\u201cH-hurt... you ...\u201d</p><p>She tensed, but kept her eyes on the road. Can\u2019t go back to my place. Ten-to-one odds said they already knew where she lived.</p><p>Can\u2019t go to a hotel. Not like she could check in with the demon handcuffed to her. Explaining that to the desk clerk would be\u2014</p><p>\u201cIf ...h-hurt you...\u201d</p><p>Oh, that just didn\u2019t sound good. What the hell was happening to the guy back there? That left hand of his was holding way too tight to her waist.</p><p>\u201cB-burn me...\u201d</p><p>Hell.</p><p>They needed a safe place to crash and they needed it now.</p><p>The instant Baton Rouge Police Captain Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Young saw the flaming remains of the red Corvette, his gut clenched, and he knew hell had come calling.</p><p>Antonio jumped out of his car and rushed forward, grabbing one of the uniforms already on the scene. \u201cWhere\u2019s the driver?\u201d Because he knew that car.</p><p>The young cop spun to look at him, and gulped when he saw Antonio\u2019s face. \u201cD-don\u2019t know, s-sir ...\u201d</p><p>Those flames were burning so high. Antonio couldn\u2019t see the front seat of the car. The \u2018Vette was smashed to hell and back, and all that fire ...</p><p>\u201cWe found \u2018em this way. Abandoned rig and the sports car\u2014\u201d</p><p>A rig that had smashed right into the driver\u2019s side door. It takes a lot to kill a demon.</p><p>He released the cop and yanked out his phone. He punched in Zane\u2019s number. Waited, waited ...</p><p>Customer not available. The automated message clicked on, and he nearly shattered his phone.</p><p>Dammit. Antonio paced away, feeling the heat from the fire singe his skin. If Zane wasn\u2019t answering, there was only one person he could contact.</p><p>He called Pak. Nothing happened at Night Watch without that charmer\u2019s approval. Nothing. So it was past three a.m., Pak was probably at home, sleeping, but ...</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, captain?\u201d Pak\u2019s smooth voice asked with no hint of sleep slurring the words.</p><p>Antonio cast a fast glance back at the wreckage, hunched his shoulders, and paced around the fire truck. \u201cWhat kind of case is Zane Wynter working on right now?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Come on! \u201cPak, don\u2019t screw with me right now. I\u2019ve got a crew of humans out here on Montgomery Lane, and I need to know what we\u2019re stepping into.\u201d Because he knew the real deal about the world. He knew that all the nightmares people had-those nightmares were nothing when compared to reality.</p><p>Once upon a time, he\u2019d thought the worst things on the streets were the human killers who sliced and diced their prey. Then he\u2019d met the vampires. They drained their prey, tortured them, made them beg for death, and then wouldn\u2019t let them die.</p><p>Humans weren\u2019t the worst predators on the streets. Not even close. If only.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an Ignitor in town,\u201d Pak finally said.</p><p>His gaze darted to the flaming vehicles. \u201cNo shit.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cHave you talked to Wynter in the last thirty minutes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we may have a problem.\u201d May? Who was he kidding? \u201cI\u2019m staring at Zane\u2019s car right now, and the flames burning it are bright enough to light the whole damn block.\u201d</p><p>The cabin looked deserted. Jana shoved down the kickstand and steadied the bike. It looked deserted. Hopefully, it actually was. She\u2019d scouted out this area before, just in case she needed a place to crash.</p> <p>And I do. I really, really do.</p><p>The wooden cabin was buried in the swamp. A long, ramshackle pier ran from the side of the cabin and skated out over that murky, green water.</p><p>\u201cOkay, demon, we\u2019ve got to move.\u201d She tried to roll her shoulders, but his weight was too heavy. \u201cZane? Come on, Zane, move!\u201d</p><p>She felt him flinch. Then he eased back and slid off the motorcycle. She followed him, her thighs still trembling a bit. It had been far too long since she\u2019d gone for a wild ride on a cycle.</p><p>\u201cThe motorcycle should be safe behind these bushes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can go inside\u201d-it looked like no one had been there in months, a very good thing\u2014\u201cand then figure out what the hell we\u2019re going to do next.\u201d</p> <p>He just stared down at her. Dawn had finally come, lighting up the darkness, and she could see a faint rim of green around the outer edge of his irises, but the black coloring\u2014that demon black\u2014was darkening. The lines on his face were tight and hard.</p><p>Jana licked her lips. \u201cZane?\u201d She tugged her cuffed hand. The metal bit into her wrist.</p><p>Alone with a drugged demon. Hello, dream date.</p><p>As she stared up at him, the green in his eyes disappeared, and only the black was left. Just that deep, soulless black.</p><p>B-burn me ...</p><p>She turned away from him. Not like she could get away from him, though, not with that freaking fireproof, Other-proof metal chaining them together. But when she started moving, he did, too. That was something, right?</p> <p>It\u2019s okay. He\u2019s one of the good guys. He worked for Night Watch. He brought down the paranormals who hurt humans. He hunted them, he brought them in, or he took them out.</p><p>One of the good guys. Right, that\u2019s what she had to remember. She risked a fast glance back at him. It was just that he didn\u2019t look particularly good right then.</p><p>He looked like he wanted to eat her.</p><p>Jana grabbed the doorknob. Twisted. Locked, of course. Because who would leave a cabin unlocked for any squatter-like me-to come by and enter? Oh, well. She lifted her foot and kicked the door.</p><p>That hurt.</p><p>Swearing, she limped back. Zane\u2019s left arm wrapped around her and pulled her to the side.</p><p>Okay, he felt warm, and she sure needed some warmth right then. After a charge, all of the heat left her body too fast. And it was cold out there in the swamp. The cold cut of air knifed right to the bone.</p><p>Not saying a word, Zane lifted his foot and kicked the door. The lock snapped, the door flew open, and\u2014</p> <p>And he pushed her inside.</p><p>Darkness. Dust. That musty, closed-in smell that a place got after being sealed up for too long.</p><p>She exhaled and tried not let her nose twitch. \u201cI need to take a look at your wounds.\u201d Not that it would do much good. The drugs would be in his system now. \u201cI need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d Guttural. That rough word was the only warning she had. His hands caught her arms and he spun her around, pressing her back against the wooden wall of the cabin. He crowded her in and locked his hard, hot body against hers.</p><p>The demon was aroused. His cock pushed against the front of his jeans. No mistaking that thick swell. Especially not when his lower body was crushed to hers.</p><p>Her hand pushed against him. \u201cZane, you\u2019re hurt. You\u2019ve got to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He jerked her cuffed hand up with his, forcing it above her head. Then his left hand caught hers and lifted it high. He pinned her to the wall. Her eyes had adjusted a bit to the interior of the cabin, and she could see him better now. The stark planes and angles of his face. His eyes ...</p><p>So dark.</p><p>One of the good guys. He came into a burning building to save me, he\u2019s not-</p><p>His mouth crashed onto hers. He caught her gasp, and his tongue drove into her mouth.</p><p>The kiss was too rough. His lips were too hard. Too demanding. He didn\u2019t ask, didn\u2019t seduce, he just took.</p><p>His hips thrust against hers, that thick cock sliding against her, letting Jana know exactly what her demon wanted. Me.</p><p>Her heart slammed into her chest. Her nipples were tight, too sensitive.</p><p>And damn but that demon could work his tongue.</p><p>No! This shouldn\u2019t be happening, she knew it. Drugged. Hell. The guy probably didn\u2019t even know what he was doing. Or who I am.</p><p>She tore her mouth away from his, panting. She needed to\u2014</p><p>His mouth went to her throat. Licking, sucking, honing in on the spot that always made her knees go weak. Oh, hell, right there.</p><p>She choked back a moan. He was warming her with his lips and his lust. Warming her, just when she\u2019d started to grow cold from the after-effects of the charge.</p><p>Part of her wanted to hold him tight. Wanted to dig her nails into his back and hold on for the wild ride that she knew would come. But ...</p><p>But the man had taken two tranqs, and she knew what the drugs could do-demons could be so weak.</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut. \u201cZane ... this isn\u2019t you.\u201d Yeah, they\u2019d kissed before, but that had been different. A skilled play of tongue and lips. Seduction. A tease.</p><p>This was desperate. Wild. Rough.</p><p>And, dammit, she liked it. Because the charge from the fire had burned off. The need that it left behind-always left behind-had her gut tightening. Adrenaline had filled her blood as she used her power, and without that rush, she was lost, shaken, needing.</p><p>He freed her left wrist. His hand snaked between them and found her breast. Zane fondled her through her bra, and her nipple pebbled even more for him. Her sex creamed, and she couldn\u2019t help it-she arched her hips against him.</p><p>He wrenched open the top of her shirt, sending buttons flying. Then his hand slipped inside. Hot flesh, callused fingertips touched her. He yanked her bra out of the way and strummed her nipple.</p><p>Her teeth clenched. Not right. He was drugged. This wasn\u2019t... Jeez, that felt good. But... \u201cZane!\u201d The word burst from her.</p><p>His hand was sliding down her stomach, heading for the snap of her jeans.</p><p>Heat rolled off his body. Delicious, wonderful heat. But his eyes were blank. His touch too fierce, and\u2014</p><p>Jana twisted and managed to break away from him. She took two stumbling steps, then the handcuffs yanked her back.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>His left hand rose and curled around her throat. Her pulse raced against his fingers. Demons and drugs ... everyone knew that was one screwed-up combination. So what, the tranqs had been some kind of sexual stimulant for him? Just great.</p><p>She turned her head and met his stare. \u201cYou\u2019re drugged, Zane. You don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re doing.\u201d But it sure felt good.</p><p>He blinked. Once. Twice. Real slow, and he almost looked like a robot she\u2019d seen on a sci-fi show once, trying to process information.</p><p>His gaze dropped to her shirt front, to the gaping neckline and the black bra that was all too visible. \u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m doing.\u201d His voice came out deeper, rougher than ever before. Rough, but no emotion. Too flat. Not his voice.</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d If... hurt... you ... The guy had been trying to warn her before. Such a damn good-guy thing to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fucking you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Need ate at his gut. A white-hot, burning need that fired Zane\u2019s body from the inside out. He could smell her. Jana. Her scent was all around him, the rich scent of her sex tormenting him.</p><p>Take.</p><p>His vision had narrowed to her. He could barely hear what she was saying because his heart drummed too loudly in his ears, the blood flowing too fast and hard.</p><p>Take.</p><p>She trembled in his grasp. Trembled. Small and weak. Ready for him. Her mouth ... red and swollen. He\u2019d kiss her. He\u2019d touch her. He\u2019d fuck her. He\u2019d do anything he wanted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d she said, her eyes big and wide. \u201cI know you said ... but I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Hurt him? Nothing could hurt him. No one.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to, but I will. And you\u2019ll probably even thank me for this tomorrow.\u201d Her chin tilted back. \u201cTake your hand off me or\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. Laughed, picked her up, and tossed her onto the old bed in the corner. Dust billowed in the air.</p><p>\u201cI warned you,\u201d she said, then bit her lip as fire crackled in the air. A hot, thick circle of orange flame.</p><p>He waved his hand and the fire vanished.</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014\u201d She shook her head, sending that black mane flying over her shoulders. Her eyes narrowed, and the fire flared again.</p><p>With barely a thought, he put out the fire. The power of the demon burned wild and free in him, pulsing, just beneath the skin.</p><p>His knees hit the mattress, and then he covered her body. \u201cThat the best you got?\u201d Wouldn\u2019t be good enough. Nothing would.</p><p>A thick, choking darkness pressed against him, and she was the only damn light he could see. Her ... and her flames. Already flickering again.</p><p>His face hovered over hers. \u201cYou can\u2019t hurt me.\u201d His temples throbbed. And her smell... fucking driving me crazy. There was nothing like the scent of a woman\u2019s arousal. And Jana was aroused. He smelled her cream, and he had felt the tight buds of her nipples. \u201cNothing can hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Sorry to do this but ...\u201d Then her knee drove into his groin. A vicious, fast drive that sent pain radiating through his body. \u201cBut our first time together isn\u2019t going to be while you\u2019re flying on tranqs.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. His hand locked around her hip. The light around her face began to fade, even as the flames flew higher, burned brighter. His fingers clamped onto her flesh.</p><p>Burn, let the fucking fire burn, can\u2019t touch me, can\u2019t hurt me.</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d A breath of sound, a gasp, lost. Her gaze caught his. There was fear in her eyes. Fear lurking in that river of blue. Afraid... of me. Monster.</p><p>He had her on the bed. His body shoved hard against hers. What the hell was he doing?</p><p>His back teeth clenched, and he fought through the waves of lust, through the darkness tangling his mind and the need that stole his breath.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with you ... your eyes. ...\u201d</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut and fought to pull back the beast. But he was slipping off the leash. Slipping. Her breath whispered over his face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he lied, and he forced his hand off her hip. Her scent. \u201cI\u2019m in control now.\u201d His fingers gripped the old, dirty covers. Ripped them. His lashes lifted, slowly. Her eyes were on him and she instantly trapped his gaze.</p><p>Bed. Jana. Sweet flesh. Hot fire.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said again, growling the words and hoping like hell that he could stay in control. Focus.</p><p>What was happening to him? His body was so tight. Ready to explode. And he wanted her more than he wanted breath. Wanted her, open and ready, with the heat blazing around them. No, from them.</p><p>His head was going to explode. A hard, fierce pounding thundered at both temples, and a flicker of light danced in the air.</p><p>\u201cJana, it\u2019s going to be all ... right.\u201d Her breath sighed out.</p><p>He could hold on to his control. He could keep the devil inside. He could\u2014</p><p>Jana shouted his name, and Zane blacked out.</p><p>\u201cZane? Zane!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d crashed on top of her. His eyes had flickered in those last few moments, shooting back and forth from green to black, and she\u2019d thought, really thought for a moment there, that he was coming back. Him, Zane, not the demon inside him.</p><p>Then his eyes had flashed pitch black.</p><p>And he\u2019d slammed into her. No, onto her.</p><p>She tried to suck in a deep breath. Tried and failed. Oh, the guy weighed a ton. Of course. And he had her smashed into the lumpy mattress. \u201cUh, Zane?\u201d She tried tapping his shoulder.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>His head was nestled in the crook of her neck. He breathed softly now, the light puffs of air sending a shiver over her each time they touched her sensitive flesh.</p><p>Alive, just passed out.</p><p>She shifted a bit as she tried to maneuver from underneath him, but the guy was pure muscle. Thick muscle.</p><p>Her breath rasped out, and she stared up at the ceiling. \u201cGreat. Just great.\u201d</p><p>Trapped beneath a demon. Talk about one hell of an ending to her already screwed-up night.</p><p>Antonio stared at the fax he\u2019d just received. The woman in the grainy photo didn\u2019t look particularly dangerous. Delicate features, wide eyes. Sexy mouth.</p><p>But if he\u2019d learned anything in this business ... well, it was that the surface lied.</p><p>\u201cPut out an APB for Jana Carter,\u201d he told Officer Penton. The fresh-faced kid stood next to him, watching with narrowed eyes and nervous hands. \u201cThis woman is wanted in connection with a series of arsons in New Orleans,\u201d and probably a few in Baton Rouge. \u201cWe\u2019ve got intel to suggest that she\u2019s in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell the cops out there to be careful. This one is extremely dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s armed?\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t have to be armed to be dangerous. \u201cYes,\u201d he lied. He seemed to spend most of his days lying. \u201cShe\u2019s not to be approached. If she\u2019s spotted, I want to be contacted ASAP.\u201d He held Penton\u2019s stare, driving the point home. \u201cNo one is to approach or try to apprehend her without me.\u201d Because if the cops went up against someone like her\u2014</p><p>He\u2019d be cleaning up the ashes.</p><p>Penton nodded quickly and hurried off to spread the news. Antonio looked down at his watch. Almost noon. It had sure taken Pak a long time to play ball and send that fax. The guy must have been holding out, hoping for word from Zane. Word that hadn\u2019t come. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Where was the demon? Was he alive? No bodies had been found in the Corvette, but that didn\u2019t mean Zane was still breathing. Not with an Ignitor out there. If she\u2019d been letting her fire free, the poor bastard could be surrounded by the flames.</p><p>Zane awoke to find himself surrounded. Soft, silken flesh cradled him. A sweet, feminine scent flooded his nostrils. When he opened his eyes, he found himself staring at Jana\u2019s sleeping face.</p><p>What the hell?</p> <p>Her eyes were closed, and her lashes cast dark shadows on her cheeks. Her skin looked even paler today, and he noticed a small, dark mole near the corner of her left eye. Her hair spread on the old pillow behind her, a tangled darkness.</p><p>Carefully, slowly, he eased up. Her body was wrapped around his, not under it. One of her arms was around him, while one of his held her waist. Her leg was between his, and her head tilted close to his.</p><p>And her shirt was open, revealing black lace and the upper curves of her round breasts. A line of red scratches marred her smooth flesh.</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath and wondered what was going on. Had he done that? Had he hurt\u2014</p><p>\u201cAre you with me?\u201d she asked, her voice a husky whisper.</p> <p>Hell, yeah. He cleared his throat. How had they gotten in bed? Just what had they done? Her jeans were still on, so were his, so ... no sex.</p><p>That was a good thing, right? His temples ached like a bitch, and he swallowed, tasting copper on his tongue.</p><p>Jana\u2019s lashes lifted, nice and slow, revealing those sexy eyes. Sleepy and dark blue. \u201cDo you even know who I am?\u201d</p><p>He licked dry lips. \u201cTrust me, baby, you\u2019re pretty unforgettable.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze searched his. \u201cThen what\u2019s my name?\u201d</p><p>He let his brows rise as he studied her. \u201cYou mean the name you seem to be using again this time? It\u2019s Jana. Jana</p> <p>Carter.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled.</p><p>\u201cNow, Jana, why don\u2019t you tell me just what happened.\u201d And why we\u2019re in bed together. Sure, he\u2019d thought about fucking her, but then he\u2019d found out about her little tendency to burn on contact.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA big rig slamming into us.\u201d My car. Someone would pay. \u201cSome assholes shooting....\u201d He frowned, struggling to recall and shove past the thick fog in his mind. \u201cI got hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were hit twice.\u201d She eased her arm away from him and tried to slide her leg from between his thighs.</p><p>A bright, hard, painful memory flashed through his mind.</p><p>\u201cAh, remember that, do you?\u201d She stilled, and her lips quirked just a bit. Not enough to make her dimple flash.</p> <p>Images flew through his mind. Jana-her mouth red and open. Pinned against the wall. Her arms over her head. Her breath panting out.</p><p>Her shirt open, gaping, his hands on her flesh. Tight nipples. Pebble hard. He\u2019d want to taste her.</p><p>Fire. Surrounding him.</p><p>Jana ... on the bed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d The memory of her words filled his mind.</p><p>He jumped from the bed, moving fast, only to have her yell as she tumbled after him.</p><p>The cuffs.</p><p>He froze, staring at her wrist. Still bound. He took a breath and tasted her. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d</p><p>She blinked and seemed to see him. \u201cAh. Guess you are back now.\u201d Jana pushed herself up, stretching a bit, and the few remaining buttons on her top strained with the movement. He leaned forward, trying to give her more room to move. Where were the cuff keys? His left hand dove into his pockets. Nothing. Figured.</p><p>Jana just sat there, staring up at him, with no expression on her pretty face.</p><p>How was she so calm? \u201cWhat did I do to you?\u201d He remembered need. A white-hot lust that had thundered through his body and driven all sanity from his mind. Take. The hunger had been too much. He\u2019d wanted her. Planned to have her, then-He swallowed. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d No, please, shit, he didn\u2019t want to-</p><p>She laughed at that. A light, quick chuckle, and she swung her legs over the side of the bed. \u201cI\u2019m not easy to hurt.\u201d</p><p>Lie. She was human. Human with some strong psychic powers, but human nonetheless. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have-I don\u2019t know why I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jana rolled her eyes. \u201cYou were drugged, dude. You took two hits of the tranq. You got handsy, and then you collapsed, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>All? His back teeth were clenched so hard his jaw ached. \u201cI don\u2019t ... do particularly well with drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat demon does?\u201d</p><p>So she knew.</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t realize just how dangerous he could be when the drugs were in his system. She didn\u2019t understand just how lucky she was to still be breathing.</p><p>He stiffened his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The words were stark. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have touched you.\u201d He sucked in a quick breath and just caught more of her scent.</p><p>Her head cocked toward him.</p><p>\u201cWhatever I did to you\u201d-he held her stare, because the shame was his\u2014\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her face softened, just for a moment, and he heard her mutter something that sounded like, \u201cBeing a good guy again ...\", but then she rose and turned her back on him.</p><p>His lips pressed together.</p><p>\u201cYou stopped.\u201d She glanced back over her shoulder. \u201cYeah, the drug had you wired for a bit, but you pulled back. You got your control.\u201d A little shrug. \u201cBut then you passed out before you could get off the bed.\u201d</p><p>The drumming of his heart echoed in his ears. \u201cYou\u2019re telling the truth?\u201d</p><p>Now she did smile. A big, wide grin that, oh, hell, flashed the dimple in her cheek. \u201cWould I lie?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cWhat about the marks on your chest?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at herself, and the smile faded. \u201cThese aren\u2019t from you. They\u2019re courtesy of the vampire who caught me in the alley.\u201d</p><p>The one she\u2019d torched. The bastard had attacked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen other demons on the drug.\u201d Her voice pulled his eyes back to her face. A flicker of sadness appeared in her gaze. \u201cEven with one dose, they don\u2019t know what the hell is going on.\u201d A considering pause as her stare measured him. \u201cYou must be pretty strong.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to touch that one.</p><p>But she, apparently, was. Jana faced him fully, one brow up. \u201cWhat are you on the power scale? An eight? Maybe pushing nine?\u201d</p><p>The demon power scale. A scale that ran from one to ten. One being the low end, the demons who barely had any power above a human\u2019s latent psychic talents. And ten being the demons who could bring hell to earth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m strong enough,\u201d was all he said.</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d She lifted her wrist, raising the cuffs and his hand. \u201cThen get these things off, demon. Get them off, and we can just walk away from all this.\u201d</p><p>If only. \u201cA witch I know put an enchantment on \u2018em.\u201d Standard protocol for Night Watch containment gear and weaponry. A little bonus Pak had always insisted on throwing in. \u201cI can\u2019t break them.\u201d She deserved the full truth. \u201cAnd even if I could, I couldn\u2019t let you walk away.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. Soft lips. So soft.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn well kidding me,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, I\u2019m not.\u201d He straightened his shoulders. The hunt hadn\u2019t gone down at all like he planned, but he was sticking to the rules. He\u2019d been an ass, and he\u2019d regret last night for years to come-drugs or no drugs, I shouldn\u2019t have scared her. But he had a job to do. \u201cThere\u2019s a bounty on you. You\u2019ve got to pay for what you did.\u201d</p><p>Her lips formed an outraged \u201cO.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone save me from good guys.\u201d She punched her index finger into his chest. Hard. \u201cI could have killed you while you slept.\u201d</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she told him, dropping her voice, but keeping her eyes up. \u201cWalk away from me. Trust me, it will be the best move you\u2019ve ever made in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my bounty.\u201d And there were dead bodies she had to answer for.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re a fool. You\u2019re gonna get caught in the crossfire. You\u2019ll die. Or you\u2019ll just wish for death.\u201d</p><p>Like he hadn\u2019t done that before. He\u2019d died when he was sixteen, and the demon inside had taken over. He\u2019d been fighting the devil ever since. \u201cPromises, promises, baby.\u201d</p><p>For just an instant, one instant, her eyes seemed to flare red.</p><p>Zane stiffened, but then the blue flooded back into her gaze.</p><p>She licked her lips, and her eyes darted around the cabin. Darted, then paused somewhere just over his shoulder. \u201cThis sucks.\u201d</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Then she started marching away from him, heading toward a shut door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been over nine hours, demon. I\u2019ve got to use the bathroom.\u201d She grabbed the door and slipped inside. \u201cNow be a good Southern gentleman, and don\u2019t even think about looking at me.\u201d</p><p>Southern gentleman? Since when?</p><p>The cuffs were a damn inconvenience, but they\u2019d be free soon, both of them. He\u2019d take her to Night Watch, turn her in, and be rid of his Ignitor.</p><p>Case closed.</p><p>No more temptation. No more fire. No more Jana. \u201cDamn demon,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cJana, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it!\u201d</p><p>Sorry. He bit the word back, but the guilt burned in him. He was sorry. For what he\u2019d done to her last night ... and for what he would be doing, soon.</p><p>The demon was really going to turn her in. Jana followed Zane outside the cabin. He stopped, and glanced around the area, obviously searching for the motorcycle.</p><p>Would he remember where they\u2019d stashed it?</p><p>Nope. That glinting stare turned back on her, and he lifted one dark brow. What? Did the guy really expect her help? He was turning her in!</p><p>She smiled back at him and just waited.</p><p>\u201cJana...\u201d</p><p>Her body hurt. Ached. That car crash hadn\u2019t been an easy hit, and she was sure she sported a ton of bruises beneath her clothes. She needed a hot bath-for the aches and to wash away the blood. She needed some food. And she needed a bed that didn\u2019t smell like crap.</p><p>Instead, she\u2019d get-what? Jail? A fast trip to some human slammer? How long would she stay there?</p><p>\u201cI hate being locked up,\u201d she muttered. She\u2019d already spent too many years being caged. Her gaze drifted around the swamp. Open. Free. This was what she wanted. Why couldn\u2019t everyone just leave her alone and let her have it?</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you shouldn\u2019t kill people.\u201d</p><p>His words had her stiffening. \u201cYou don\u2019t know a damn thing about me.\u201d</p><p>Faint lines bracketed his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You typed my name in some computer at Night</p><p>Watch and all of a sudden you think you know about me? You think you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you started your first fire when you were thirteen. A fire that killed your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStepfather.\u201d There was a difference. An important one.</p><p>He crept closer. Not that those cuffs let him stray too far. \u201cWhy? Why the hell do you do it? You don\u2019t have to hurt people. You don\u2019t have to use the fire at all. You could\u2019ve been normal\u2014\u201d</p><p>Was he crazy? \u201cDemon, I\u2019m as far from normal as you are.\u201d Did he think she\u2019d chosen to be like this? Did he know how many nights she\u2019d cried and begged God to just let her be normal? Jana sucked in a long breath. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve heard about Ignitors....\u201d Because it wasn\u2019t like her kind were thick on the ground. \u201cBut when the flames start that first time, there\u2019s no controlling the fire.\u201d Not when the flames burn so fast, and you scream and beg for it to stop.</p><p>Only for the fire to flare hotter.</p><p>It had taken her years to learn control, and those lessons had been painful.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve killed people with your fire.\u201d A muscle flexed in his jaw.</p><p>\u201cOh, and you\u2019re Mr. Innocent?\u201d Doubtful. She\u2019d never met an innocent demon. \u201cI bet you\u2019ve just gone your whole life, and you haven\u2019t ever hurt anyone, right? You\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last person I killed was an Ignitor.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t expect that. Jana swallowed and studied him, letting her eyes sweep over his face. The curl of his lip seemed cruel. His eyes too sharp and hard.</p><p>He stared at her and said, \u201cI broke her neck. She never even knew I was coming for her, not until it was too late.\u201d</p><p>Well, damn. Goose bumps rose on her arms. Not from the cold. Not this time. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she was working with a band of vampires. She was torturing my friends, and I wasn\u2019t going to stand by and watch them die.\u201d</p><p>So she\u2019d died instead.</p><p>His hand lifted. Dammit, Jana flinched. But he was just brushing back her hair. His knuckles grazed her cheek. \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do it? Make me understand. Give me something here. Why\u2019d you start the fires?\u201d</p><p>Screams that wouldn\u2019t stop. \u201cBecause I could.\u201d That\u2019s all she\u2019d say. Was that a fair exchange of information? No. But then, she hadn\u2019t forced him to answer her question.</p><p>And she wouldn\u2019t answer his.</p><p>Jana spun away and marched for the thick line of brush, dragging him with her. \u201cThe motorcycle\u2019s over here.\u201d</p><p>Because even the idea of being turned over to the folks at Night Watch didn\u2019t seem so bad right then. But ripping her soul open and baring her past to the demon? Yeah, rain check, please. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t bare her soul for anyone. Her secrets were hers, and she planned to take them to the grave.</p><p>They stopped for gas at some rundown station. The bike vibrated beneath her legs and exhaust drifted around them until Zane killed the engine.</p><p>He was driving this time. The big, bad demon in control.</p> <p>Jana heard a gasp when she got off the motorcycle, and she turned her head to see an older lady with stone-gray hair and narrowed eyes staring at her. No, not at her exactly, but rather at the cuffs.</p><p>Fabulous. Between the cuffs and her gaping shirt, Jana knew she was the image of wholesomeness. Oh, well. She flashed the lady a smile. \u201cHe\u2019s a little kinky.\u201d So am I.</p><p>Zane swore.</p><p>The lady\u2019s jaw dropped. Then she slammed her door and drove away with a squeal of tires.</p><p>Her smile spread a bit. A growl reached her ears. She glanced at Zane and found him frowning at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>He jerked the gas nozzle out of the tank and shoved it back into place on the pump.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d She sidled closer and ignored the stench of gasoline. She always had to be careful at places like this. One wrong thought... boom! \u201cAre you trying to say that you don\u2019t have a kinky side? Because I\u2019m not buying that.\u201d She put her hand on his chest. Let her fingers rest just over his heart. A nice, fast beat. \u201cI saw you last night, remember? I know just how wild and rough you are inside. You wanted sex, fast and hot.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared and his heartbeat kicked up even more. Interesting.</p><p>She tipped her head back. \u201cHave you had a few fantasies? While we were on the road, and I was wrapped around you, while we\u2019re chained together, have you thought about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of game are you playing?\u201d he demanded and she heard the arousal in his voice. She could see it in the taut lines of his face. If she looked down-she\u2019d peeked when they\u2019d hopped off the bike-she knew he\u2019d still be hard for her.</p><p>What kind of game was she playing? The only kind she liked. The dangerous kind. But she was running out of options.</p> <p>\u201cGet on the bike, Jana.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. \u201cYou know\u201d-she let her lashes lower, veiling her eyes, and she dropped her hand\u2014\u201cI could burn this whole place in about two seconds.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped an arm around her waist and lifted her up. No strain there. Such a strong demon. Zane had already healed from the injuries he\u2019d gotten in the wreck and from the tranq shots.</p><p>He eased her onto the motorcycle and kept his left hand around her a bit too long. \u201cYou could, but you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you scoped the place when we pulled up. You saw the two kids pumping up the tires on their bikes, and the old man behind the register inside.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou saw them, and I saw your face.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. He\u2019d seen too much.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not blowing anything up here.\u201d He eased in front of her and started the cycle quickly. He knew how to hotwire, too. Figured.</p> <p>The cycle roared. \u201cHold tight,\u201d he ordered, like she had much of a choice. \u201cJust another twenty minutes and we\u2019ll be back in the city.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, they\u2019d had to drive for a while because she\u2019d hauled butt and gotten them as far away as she could last night. Only to be dragged back now.</p><p>She closed her eyes, waiting for him to shoot the cycle forward.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>Jana opened one eye and found Zane gazing at her over his shoulder. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His brows were low. \u201cIf you were really a cold-hearted killer, it wouldn\u2019t matter about the kids.\u201d</p><p>Just figuring that out? Give the man a cookie. \u201cI\u2019m saving all my fire for you, lover.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. Flashed her those too-white teeth and laughed.</p><p>Then the motorcycle surged forward.</p><p>Jana held on tight. The guy\u2019s muscles were like stone beneath her hands and her hair whipped behind her. No helmet. She might as well be begging for death.</p><p>Once he dumped her at Night Watch and those powers that be decided what to do with her, well, she just might actually beg.</p><p>No.</p><p>Begging didn\u2019t do any good. She\u2019d begged before. When she\u2019d first been locked up. Begged to see her mom. Begged for help.</p><p>She\u2019d gotten nothing.</p><p>Then when those bastards out there on her trail had learned about her power, she\u2019d begged to be left alone.</p><p>What had Zane said? Normal. Yeah, she\u2019d wanted to be normal. She\u2019d begged for that, too.</p><p>Begging got a girl nowhere, fast. Fighting, shoving, letting the fire rage-that was the only way to make a difference.</p><p>When she got to Night Watch, she\u2019d do whatever was necessary to stay alive. And if she had to let out the flames, then the place would burn.</p><p>And if innocent people were inside?</p><p>She pressed her face against Zane\u2019s back and wondered just how far into the darkness she was willing to go.</p><p>The motorcycle took another curve, nice and slow. Zane hadn\u2019t driven fast. He\u2019d been careful the whole time. After one accident, maybe he was worried about a repeat. She sure was.</p><p>They eased from the curve, heading down the long road, and sirens screamed at them.</p><p>What? Jana\u2019s head whipped around just in time to see a patrol car fly out of its nice, sneaky hiding place on the side of the road. Blue lights flashed, and the siren wailed louder.</p><p>Go. Faster. Faster.</p><p>She always had the same response to cop cars. Mostly because those cars were usually chasing her. Just like this one.</p><p>The motorcycle began to slow down. \u201cNo!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>But Zane was stopping. He pulled the motorcycle over to the side of the road and shoved down the kickstand.</p><p>Her nails bit into his side. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and met her gaze. \u201cWe aren\u2019t wearing helmets. The guy\u2019s got to stop us.\u201d</p><p>She gulped. Right. Helmets. A normal stop. And such a Boy Scout thing for the demon to say.</p><p>Zane climbed off the bike. The handcuffs glinted in the light.</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you going to tell him about these?\u201d she asked. She wanted those things to be ash at her feet. Unfortunately, her fire didn\u2019t work on them. She\u2019d tried burning them last night. No luck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my bounty I.D.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThe cops can check me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan he get us keys\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStep away from the woman!\u201d The barked order carried easily to them.</p><p>Here we go. Jana looked at the cop. A young guy, with light blond hair, a handsome, if soft face, and a perfectly pressed uniform.</p><p>The cop also had his gun up and aimed at Zane.</p><p>She straightened on the motorcycle.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d Zane lifted both his hands, which, unfortunately, made her hand lift, too.</p><p>\u201cThe guy\u2019s crazy!\u201d No harm in trying a little maneuvering, right? Jana jumped off the bike and focused her desperate gaze on the cop. \u201cHelp me.\u201d Her voice trembled. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Zane snarled at her. Then, louder he said, \u201cOfficer, my name\u2019s Zane Wynter. I\u2019m a bounty hunter with the Night Watch Agency. This woman\u2019s a wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndo the cuffs.\u201d The cop had stalked closer. His clipped words cut right through the air. \u201cUndo the cuffs and let her go.\u201d</p><p>Jana blinked. Ah, yeah, that had been easy. She could look desperate and pitiful when she wanted but- Too easy.</p><p>Tension knotted her gut. That gun was aimed straight at Zane\u2019s chest.</p><p>Zane started to lower his arms. \u201cI\u2019ve got my I.D. in my back pocket, just let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake off the damn cuffs!\u201d Spit flew from the cop\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cEase up,\u201d Zane said, and his hands froze. \u201cI don\u2019t have the key on me.\u201d</p><p>The gun barrel jerked a bit. No, it didn\u2019t jerk. The guy was re-aiming. Setting up his shot so that when he fired\u2014</p><p>Oh, hell. \u201cZane!\u201d</p><p>The cop fired.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>The bullet hit the middle of the handcuffs. It couldn\u2019t break the Other proof metal, so the bullet ricocheted and blazed a path of fire down the side of Zane\u2019s right thigh. Fuck.</p><p>Zane fell to the ground, dragging Jana down with him. He rolled, fast, putting his body on top of hers. Shield her. Keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch!\u201d Not his scream, though it sure could have been.</p><p>He glanced up to see the cop charging him. \u201cI just want her!\u201d the guy yelled.</p><p>Why the hell was everyone after his bounty?</p><p>\u201cHe told me not to hurt you,\u201d the cop threw out, the words directed at Jana as he strode forward and raised that gun. \u201cBut with him, deadly force is fine.\u201d</p><p>The hell it was.</p><p>Jana trembled beneath him and her skin warmed. She was charging up, getting ready to unleash her fire on this jerk coming at her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not armed!\u201d he shouted at the cop. \u201cStand down!\u201d What the hell was the guy thinking? And who was this \u201che\u201d the cop was talking about? \u201cI told you, I\u2019m a hunter with Night Watch, you need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The cop smiled and aimed that gun right at Zane\u2019s head. His finger was already squeezing that trigger. Oh, screw this. Zane focused and sent a wave of power slamming into the cop. The trigger-happy jackass screamed and flew through the air. The gun fell from his hand just as he slammed into the front windshield of the patrol car. The cop didn\u2019t get up.</p><p>Zane did. His fingers curled around Jana\u2019s, and he pulled her up with him.</p><p>\u201cIs he ... dead?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The guy would be starting to twitch a bit soon. Zane had knocked him out, not killed him. \u201cCome on.\u201d They weren\u2019t going to stand around and wait for another bullet to come flying at them.</p><p>And if I killed a cop ...</p><p>The paperwork would be a bitch.</p><p>They climbed onto the motorcycle. She wrapped her arm around him tightly. Blood dripped from his thigh. As they surged forward, he demanded, \u201cBaby, why does everyone want a piece of you?\u201d</p><p>Hell, he needed to get in touch with police Captain Antonio Young. Tony would have his back. He always did. Tony knew the score, and how to keep the peace.</p><p>Most days.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Her whisper came softly to his ears and only his enhanced hearing let him catch the words. But it didn\u2019t take enhanced senses to know she was lying.</p><p>Fifteen more minutes until they were at Night Watch. Fifteen more minutes and he\u2019d be there....</p><p>But a cop had just tried to kill him. A cop who hadn\u2019t cared about his position as a bounty hunter with Night Watch.</p><p>He glanced in the side mirror. No sign of the patrol car following them. The road branched up ahead. One side would take him back to the city. The other would lead him down a longer, curving path that wound back to the swamp.</p><p>His hesitation lasted for only a few seconds. Then he headed toward the swamp.</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d Her hold on him tightened. The lady must have studied the area pretty well before coming to set up shop in the city. Figured. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>He heard the faint hope in her words. Did she think he was going to let her go? Just walk away?</p><p>Let her.</p><p>His fingers clenched around the handlebars. \u201cGot to make a phone call,\u201d he growled back. His cell had burned in the flames, so he\u2019d have to find another phone.</p><p>He\u2019d planned to just drive back in to Night Watch, but now, no, now he was gonna check in first. Just to make sure there weren\u2019t any more surprises waiting for him.</p><p>Surprises like a cop who\u2019d been ready to blow his head off and steal his bounty.</p><p>Her hands were shaking. Jana balled her fingers into fists and stared at the faded walls of the gas station. Zane had stopped at the first phone booth he\u2019d seen, one at a closed station that seemed to be falling into the swamp.</p><p>The windows of the booth were busted out. The phone book had long been snatched, but the phone, lucky for Zane\u2014unlucky for me-still worked.</p><p>Now he was calling his boss. Probably arranging her pickup. And that was fine. She\u2019d be better off once she was away from Zane.</p><p>But he\u2019d covered her body with his. When that cop had been bearing down on them with that gun, Zane had protected her.</p><p>Freaking good-guy routine. Why\u2019d he have to do that? Why\u2019d he have to keep acting like she mattered?</p><p>A killer. That\u2019s all she was to him. She needed to remember that. Hell, he probably would have jumped in front of any bounty that had been threatened. No matter what the crime, you had to protect the cash cow, right?</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with this case,\u201d Zane\u2019s hard voice broke through her thoughts, and she knew he\u2019d made contact with Night Watch. She glanced at him and saw that his brows were drawn low, and his jaw flexed with anger.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019ve got her.\u201d His gaze slashed up to meet hers. Hot. She swallowed. That green gaze seemed to burn with intensity.</p><p>And she did like the fire.</p><p>Jana licked her lips. His gaze dropped and lingered on her mouth.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not the problem.\u201d</p><p>Uh, okay. Now her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her under control,\u201d he said.</p><p>Oh, did he?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the assholes after her that I\u2019m having trouble with. Shit, yeah, I know what happened to my \u2018Vette-I was there.\u201d</p><p>Jana almost winced. Okay. Sure, she\u2019d been the one to torch his car, but there hadn\u2019t been a lot of choice there. The car had already been smashed, anyway. Not like the thing had been in mint condition before her flames got to it.</p><p>\u201cSome jokers came up and rammed us. Get this, they weren\u2019t firing bullets. They used some kind of drugs instead.\u201d</p><p>She really wished she had shifter hearing right then. She would have loved to hear what the person on the other end of the line said because Zane\u2019s eyes flashed black for just the briefest of moments. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine.\u201d The green poured back and he stared at her. \u201cUnder control now.\u201d</p><p>Was he talking about her again? Or himself? Jana pulled restlessly at the cuff. Her wrist was aching. She wanted that damn thing off. Wanted to be on the motorcycle, riding fast and free.</p><p>\u201cA cop stopped us about fifteen minutes ago. He tried to shoot me. No, no, I\u2019m not fucking kidding you. I identified myself, and he still took aim. He wanted Jana.\u201d</p> <p>Ah, so now she was \u201cJana\u201d and not just his \u201cbounty\"? \u201cThat\u2019s something,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cI took care of him.\u201d His gaze sliced around the area. Probably searching to make sure the cop hadn\u2019t found them. \u201cBut you need to talk to Antonio. Find out what\u2019s going on.\u201d A pause. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Was the guy gonna talk all day? She exhaled and rubbed the back of her neck. A hot bath would be heaven. She had so many scrapes and bruises on her body. Hell, forget the bath, she\u2019d even settle for a shower.</p><p>Maybe even a shower with Zane. Because one last wild ride, before her freedom was ripped away, oh, that was tempting.</p><p>She bet the man would look phenomenal wet, those muscles glistening ...</p> <p>\u201cDo I want you to send out a retrieval team?\u201d</p><p>His words had her heart racing and the gaze she\u2019d accidentally dropped to his chest flew back up to his face. She couldn\u2019t help it, Jana shook her head once. No. Better the demon you knew, right?</p><p>And if she knew those assholes after her, they\u2019d trail any retrieval team. Zane would never make it back to Night Watch. Neither would she.</p><p>The handcuffs were keeping them together and, though Zane didn\u2019t realize it, those cuffs were the only thing that had kept him alive so far.</p><p>His eyes tightened just a bit at the corners. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll bring her in. We\u2019ll be there within the hour.\u201d</p><p>Then the call was over. He hung up the phone with a soft click of sound.</p> <p>\u201cYou want to tell me why that cop was after you?\u201d He stepped closer to her, his body brushing against hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in over your head,\u201d was what she told him. \u201cHaven\u2019t you realized, things aren\u2019t what they seem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings are never what they seem.\u201d He let the glamour vanish from his eyes so that she could see him as he really was. All that darkness. The back of his left hand brushed her cheek. \u201cDid you really start those fires in New Orleans? Did you kill those two humans?\u201d</p><p>Ah, the humans. Humans equaled innocents, right? She stood on her tiptoes and let her mouth come close to his. She wanted his lips. Wanted his tongue.</p><p>So she\u2019d take them.</p><p>Jana pressed her mouth against his. Her tongue snaked inside the crease of his lips, pushed inside to slide against his.</p><p>A rumble built in his throat. And then his hands were on her, the cuffs pulling her hand back as he curled his fingers around her waist. His hips rocked against her, and the long, hard heat of his arousal was more than obvious.</p><p>Take the pleasure. Enjoy the rush. Deal with the hell that comes later.</p> <p>Oh, so tempting.</p><p>She opened her mouth wider, loving the thrust of his tongue. Wishing his cock was driving into her sex the same way.</p><p>His mouth hardened on hers as the need burned between them. Her legs shifted restlessly against him as the lust pumped through her. Her panties were getting wet. He wasn\u2019t the man she should want. He wasn\u2019t safe. But ...</p><p>He was strong. Sexy.</p><p>And she\u2019d touched his wild side once.</p><p>Zane\u2019s mouth tore from hers, and Jana could have howled in frustration. \u201cDid you do it?\u201d The words were so deep that she almost couldn\u2019t understand him.</p><p>Jana swiped her tongue over her lips and tasted him.</p><p>Zane\u2019s cheeks were flushed. \u201cDid you do it?\u201d</p><p>Then she realized what he was asking. The building in New Orleans. The humans. The fire. She smiled at him and, still on her toes, she came in close and licked his upper lip.</p><p>His body tensed. Rock hard.</p><p>The two of them together-it would have been a fantastic ride. Her lashes lifted, and she gazed up into his eyes. \u201cYes, I burned them.\u201d She let her smile widen. \u201cI burned that pit to the ground, and I didn\u2019t care that they were inside.\u201d She\u2019d actually made certain they were inside.</p><p>Sometimes, she was a stickler for details like that.</p><p>Because she knew Zane was going to turn her in, she went for broke. She whispered the secret she\u2019d kept. \u201cI could hear them screaming. The fire killed them, not the smoke.\u201d They hadn\u2019t died easily.</p><p>Pain for pain. The bastards had deserved to suffer. But would Zane believe her if she told him that? No one had ever believed her before.</p><p>Not her mother.</p><p>Not the doctors.</p><p>Not her lovers.</p><p>Why should he be any different? Hell, his job was to take her down. He\u2019d read her bio. Seen everything she\u2019d done.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s why she wanted him. He knew everything. Knew the hell she\u2019d brought, and he still touched her. Still kissed her with passion and lust, like she was any other woman.</p><p>But then, he wasn\u2019t just any other man. \u201cNo regrets?\u201d he asked her, voice gruff. She eased away from him. \u201cNot a one.\u201d His fingers touched her mouth. \u201cWhen you lie ... the right side of your mouth kicks up.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cIt almost looks like you\u2019re smiling, but it\u2019s a lie, too, right?\u201d</p><p>Jana turned away from him. She\u2019d have to watch herself with Zane. But she wouldn\u2019t be with him much longer. \u201cWhy\u2019d you say it would take an hour to get back to Night Watch?\u201d She stared at the swamp. Those trees were so twisted and hunched. And the water such a dark green.</p><p>\u201cBecause we don\u2019t want to risk running into our cop friend again. We\u2019re taking the long way home, baby.\u201d His hand pressed against her back, urging her toward the motorcycle.</p><p>He climbed on first. She followed, moving to hold him tight. She was getting pretty tired of following him, but her leash didn\u2019t give her much choice.</p><p>\u201cDid they deserve it?\u201d he asked, not starting the engine. \u201cDid they deserve to have the flesh burned from them by the flames?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her cheek against his back. Sometimes, she just felt tired. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Since he couldn\u2019t see her face, he wouldn\u2019t know if she was lying ... or telling the truth.</p><p>Antonio pulled to a stop at the scene just as the ambulance arrived. The patrol car was parked on the side of the road, its light still flashing. The cop-a rookie named Peter Harris- was propped up beside the car. Blood trickled down his face, and his head sagged back.</p><p>Antonio jumped out of his car and ran to Harris. \u201cWhat the hell happened here?\u201d When he\u2019d gotten a report of the 10-108, officer needing assistance, his gut had cramped. Then he\u2019d heard the radio call: Wynter and the woman had been on the scene.</p><p>Harris tried to stand, but he slid back down to the ground with a groan. The car\u2019s front windshield was smashed, and glass shards lay scattered all over the road and the nearby grass.</p><p>But there was no sign of Zane. Or of the woman.</p><p>\u201cSaw the woman ... APB ...\u201d Harris sucked in a sharp breath when the EMT began to check his head wound. \u201cShe was ... riding on a motorcycle with some guy-the bastard attacked me.\u201d His gray eyes stared up at Tony. \u201cThrew me ten feet ... but I-I swear I never saw him ... move.\u201d</p><p>Antonio didn\u2019t let his expression waver. \u201cDescribe the bastard, officer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-big guy ...\u201d The EMTs were loading Harris onto a stretcher. \u201cAbout six-foot-two, maybe three.\u201d His lashes lowered and he blinked a few times. \u201cTwo-two hundred pounds.\u201d His head sagged a bit.</p><p>\u201cWhat color was his hair? His eyes?\u201d Antonio pressed</p><p>Harris didn\u2019t answer. The EMTs tried to take the injured cop to the ambulance. Antonio stepped right in their path. \u201cHarris isn\u2019t going anywhere yet.\u201d Not until he could figure out what was happening.</p><p>\u201cHarris!\u201d He injected a note of steely command into his voice. The cop\u2019s eyelids jerked open. \u201cDescribe the man, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-black hair. Caucasian ... early th-thirties.\u201d Okay, that description only fit thousands of men in the area.</p><p>\u201cHeard her call ... his name.\u201d The cop blinked, then met Antonio\u2019s gaze. \u201cZ-Zane ... she said Zane.\u201d</p><p>What the hell are you doing, man? \u201cI gave strict orders that the woman wasn\u2019t to be approached. I was to be notified before any apprehension effort.\u201d Cold, clipped.</p><p>Harris licked his lips. \u201cThey were ... on a motorcycle....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a concussion, Captain,\u201d one of the EMTS said, breaking through Harris\u2019s words. \u201cWe need to get him checked at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>In a minute. Antonio didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI just stopped them ... because they didn\u2019t have on ... helmets. I stopped ... them.\u201d A hard swallow. \u201cAnd he attacked.\u201d</p><p>But that didn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>\u201cSir...\u201d The EMT\u2019s face was flushed a dark red. \u201cHe needs to be in a hospital.\u201d</p><p>Clenching his teeth, Antonio moved to the side.</p><p>\u201cYou never said\u201d-Harris\u2019s voice had grown weaker- \u201cshe had a ... partner.\u201d</p><p>Because he hadn\u2019t known that Zane was working with the woman, and he sure hadn\u2019t expected the hunter to attack a cop.</p><p>What are you doing, Zane? What the hell are you doing?</p><p>Antonio turned away and marched back to his car.</p><p>Threw me ten feet... but I-I swear I never saw him... move. Harris\u2019s words echoed in his mind. The cop didn\u2019t understand. Zane hadn\u2019t actually moved. He was such a strong demon, he didn\u2019t need to move. With just a stray thought, Zane could have thrown the cop. With a wave of his hand, he could have killed the guy.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t. Zane had let the cop live, and he\u2019d protected the woman.</p><p>\u201cSir!\u201d Another uniform hurried toward him. This time, the officer was female. The uniforms were swarming the scene like bees now. \u201cDo you want to launch a search in the area for the woman?\u201d</p><p>Antonio let his stare drift down the road. No sign of a motorcycle now.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about the man?\u201d she pressed. \u201cDo we need to put out an APB for him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget the man. Just concentrate on her.\u201d Jana Carter.</p><p>\u201cBut a cop was assaulted, one of our own.\u201d Her red brows snapped low. \u201cWe need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to do whatever the hell I say.\u201d He sounded like a prick, but she\u2019d have to deal with it. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the man. You focus on her.\u201d</p><p>Before he threw his friend to the wolves-or the cops-he needed to find out exactly what was happening with Zane. If he found out that the demon had crossed the line, well\u2014</p><p>Then I\u2019ll be the first one in line to take him down.</p><p>Zane eased the motorcycle to a stop near the curb. The Night Watch building waited, just a few blocks away. He could easily see the stark lines and the old bricks of the hunting office.</p><p>He braced the kickstand and killed the motor. This was it. Time to turn in his bounty.</p><p>Zane looked over his shoulder. Jana\u2019s face was as smooth and blank as marble. No heat in those dark blue eyes. No fiery emotion on her face. Just... blank. Empty.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like that. The woman was many things, but \u201cblank\u201d wasn\u2019t one of \u2018em.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, rising. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get you inside.\u201d But, dammit, something felt wrong.</p><p>I burned that pit to the ground and I didn\u2019t care that they were inside. Hard words, but when she\u2019d said them, Jana\u2019s voice had trembled.</p><p>He stared down at her hand and frowned when he saw the dark skin around the handcuff. \u201cFuck.\u201d He reached for her wrist, lifting it lightly. A circle of dark bruises had already formed on her flesh.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she said, and her voice was as cold as her face. \u201cI bruise easily. A human trait. We just aren\u2019t built strong enough.\u201d</p><p>His fingers feathered over her skin, and Zane heard the soft rasp of her breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d He\u2019d thought she would be deposited at Night Watch less than an hour after he\u2019d cuffed her. He\u2019d never planned on all ... this.</p><p>Her gaze held his.</p><p>The woman was beautiful. No, sexy. He could still taste her, and he wanted more.</p><p>But... killer. If the file was right, he was staring at a cold, calculating killer. One who torched for money. An assassin.</p><p>Until now, she hadn\u2019t struck him as cold. With her face locked in that icy mask, with her eyes so blank-yeah, frigid came to mind.</p><p>Before, though, she\u2019d been a different woman. Wild. Passionate. Never cold. And when she\u2019d talked about New Orleans ...</p><p>His fingers curled around her right wrist. \u201cTell me about New Orleans. Tell me what really happened.\u201d</p><p>Night Watch waited just over her shoulder. The place could keep waiting.</p><p>Her smile was sad. \u201cWhy? Are you going to save me, demon? Are you going to help me? Turn your back on everything you know and protect me?\u201d</p><p>That last line caught him. \u201cJust what do you need protecting from?\u201d Not what, who.</p><p>She didn\u2019t blink, but the right side of her mouth kicked up, just a bit. \u201cNo one. I\u2019m the badass Ignitor, remember? The world needs to fear me.\u201d</p><p>She was, but she was also right about something else: Humans were weak. So easily broken. Killed.</p><p>She tugged away from him, shifting her body to face the Night Watch building. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with. If we stand around out here, we might as well paint bull\u2019s-eyes on our backs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can help you. \u201c The words were torn from him. It didn\u2019t have to be this way. She didn\u2019t have to keep charging up, didn\u2019t have to keep killing. There was more to her. He knew it.</p><p>Jana tossed him a quick look over her shoulder. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t.\u201d The cold glass had shattered in her eyes. He could see her pain and sadness now.</p><p>Then she looked away, and he felt like she\u2019d slugged him. \u201cJana...\u201d</p> <p>The doors to Night Watch burst open. Three hunters ran out and headed for them. Jude led the other two men, his blond hair shining in the sun as he charged for Jana and Zane.</p><p>\u201cGuess that\u2019s the welcome party.\u201d Her attention focused on the hunters. Her silky black hair dipped down her back. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to keep them waiting.\u201d</p><p>She stepped forward, tugging him with her. His eyes focused on Jude. This was what he wanted. What he had to do. Turn her in. They\u2019d take her inside Night Watch and\u2014</p><p>The explosion shook the street. The blast threw the three hunters to the ground as the windows of Night Watch exploded and fire blazed from the windows. Car alarms screeched down the street, and smoke billowed into the air.</p><p>And Jana just stood there, staring at the burning building. The building that housed his co-workers. His friends.</p> <p>She\u2019d gone back too easy.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d He spun Jana around. \u201cWhat the hell did you\u2014\u201d Horror was reflected in her wide eyes. Shock. Her eyes- they were blue. Not the red of an Ignitor charging up. Still blue.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t set the fire. If not her ...</p><p>His gaze flew to the building. People were running out, coughing, screaming.</p><p>He raced for the building.</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d Jana stumbled after him. Shit, the cuffs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop it!\u201d They could. Or at least they could push the flames back long enough to get the people to safety. But, dammit, those flames were so hot that he could already feel their breath on his skin.</p> <p>Pak stumbled out with ash coating his face. He had his hands around one of the female hunters, and they were both gasping. Charmers didn\u2019t have the enhanced strength of the shifters and demons. They were almost as weak as humans.</p><p>And there were humans inside that building. Humans who wouldn\u2019t last long-humans who were probably already dead.</p><p>Too hot.</p><p>He sent a blast of power at the flames, forcing them back. \u201cSee if you can get control of it,\u201d he told Jana. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get them out, we\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jude surged to his feet. His fangs were out, his claws ready to rip and slash. \u201cWhat the hell? That bitch burned Night Watch!\u201d He lunged for Jana.</p><p>Zane stepped between them. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t her.\u201d He shoved his left hand against Jude\u2019s chest. \u201cDammit, shifter, stand down. We can help!\u201d</p><p>Jude growled at him.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Zane snapped right back.</p> <p>Jude\u2019s eyes searched his. Then the shifter inclined his head in a grudging nod.</p><p>They all ran for the building, with Zane in the lead. They plunged right into the smoke and the screaming flames.</p><p>Survivors. They had to find the survivors and get them out. The heat scorched his skin and Zane threw his power at the fire, sending the flames sputtering back. Jude grabbed an unconscious hunter from the office on the left and threw the guy over his shoulder.</p><p>Jana coughed behind him. Human. Weak.</p><p>He glanced at her, his eyes watering. Her stare was red now, reflecting the flames, and he knew she was using her power to control the flames. No, to make her own fire in an effort to gain control of the other flames. Fighting fire with fire actually fucking worked.</p><p>They advanced slowly, painfully, through the smoke and fire. He passed two bodies. A secretary and a hunter who wouldn\u2019t be making it out. Then they found a demon, low level, cowering in the storage room. They pushed back the fire and sent the guy running for safety.</p><p>The fire had eaten too much of the walls. Groans echoed from above them, and Zane knew the roof wouldn\u2019t last much longer.</p><p>Jude was back, coughing and panting beside him.</p><p>\u201cAnyone else?\u201d Zane had to shout the words.</p><p>Jude\u2019s head tilted to the right. That shifter hearing was far stronger than a demon\u2019s.</p><p>The shifter pointed. They raced for the door. Ripped it open.</p><p>Penelope Evans, a new hunter, lay slumped on the floor. Her red hair stuck to her face. Jude grabbed her and hoisted her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cAnyone ... else?\u201d</p><p>A hard shake of Jude\u2019s head. \u201cNot alive.\u201d</p><p>The ceiling groaned again, and plaster fell to the floor. Time to get out of hell. Zane waved his hands, shoving back the fire as Jude raced for the door.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he told Jana, covering his mouth with his left hand, \u201clet\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>She slumped beside him. Fell into his arms.</p><p>Too much smoke.</p><p>Dammit, how dumb could he be! Ignitors could start the fires, they could shoot out those flames, but their bodies couldn\u2019t handle the smoke. That\u2019s why they worked better from a distance. Long-range assassins. See the target, send the flames, escape.</p><p>He held her tight against his chest and ran for the door, dodging the lingering flames and the falling debris. Hold on, baby. Hold on.</p><p>Zane burst through the broken remains of the front entrance just seconds after Jude. He rushed forward, nearly slamming into the firefighters who charged toward the building.</p><p>EMTs were there. They tried to take Jana from him. Tried to pull her from his arms. \u201cNo, dammit!\u201d He coughed and tasted ash. \u201cWe\u2019re cuffed!\u201d They weren\u2019t taking her any place without him. He held her tighter and hurried to the ambulance. She\u2019d need oxygen, fast. She needed to breathe clean air. Her mouth and nose were stained with ash. He put her on the stretcher. The EMT placed a mask over her face.</p><p>\u201cGet her a blanket!\u201d Zane held her hand, probably too tightly but screw it. \u201cShe\u2019s freezing.\u201d Her body had begun to shake. \u201cJana?\u201d</p><p>She moaned into the mask.</p><p>He was such a fucking idiot. She couldn\u2019t handle the heat. He knew that. All the Other knew that about Ignitors. They could bring the heat, but the smoke-hell, it was fucking poison to them. They could control the flames, not the smoke.</p><p>A heavy hand landed on his shoulder. He looked back and saw Pak staring at Jana.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t her!\u201d Zane fired. \u201cLook, I know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d what he\u2019d thought, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t her. She helped me. We saved as many as we could!\u201d But Zane had seen the dead, and he would remember them for the rest of his life.</p><p>Hollings, the charmer who had a way with the ladies. Giles Lang, the hybrid demon who\u2019d been trying to fit in. Stacey Keith ... ah, hell, she\u2019d been a year away from retirement.</p><p>All gone.</p><p>His thumb brushed over Jana\u2019s knuckles. \u201cShe didn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cThen who the hell did?\u201d The fierce question didn\u2019t come from Pak. Jude had stalked up to the ambulance, and he watched Jana with eyes that glowed too bright. \u201cThere was no accelerant. I didn\u2019t catch so much as a whiff of scent\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jana\u2019s fingers tightened around Zane\u2019s. His gaze snapped back to her face. Her eyes were opening, slowly, and the twinge of red still remained.</p><p>\u201cA fucking Ignitor.\u201d</p><p>She flinched at Jude\u2019s snarl.</p><p>Zane hunched over her. \u201cBack off!\u201d He took a breath. Her eyes were on him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d His voice was still rough, but softer, for her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be all right.\u201d She looked so vulnerable. So defenseless. Another one of her tricks? A quick deception?</p><p>No. She\u2019d fallen in that inferno. She\u2019d sagged in his arms, and fear had iced his heart. \u201cJust breathe, baby.\u201d</p><p>But she was shaking her head. She shoved off the mask and started coughing.</p><p>\u201cJana!\u201d</p><p>Tears leaked from her eyes. \u201cHow ... many dead?\u201d His lips thinned. \u201cAt least three.\u201d The fire had been too strong.</p><p>As he watched Jana, the vulnerability slowly disappeared. She swiped away the tears from her cheeks. The fear and the horror disappeared from her face until ... nothing remained.</p><p>Now she\u2019s pretending. The mask was back, and he didn\u2019t like it one bit.</p><p>She pushed up on the gurney and the blanket fell away. \u201cWe need to get out of here,\u201d she whispered, her voice hoarse from the smoke. \u201cThis was an attack, it was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWynter!\u201d</p><p>Aw, hell. Not what he needed right then. His gaze flew to the left. Jude was already edging back, and Captain Antonio Young was shoving his way through the crowd to get to them. The guy\u2019s badge gleamed on his hip, and the butt of his gun poked from the holster on his side.</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d A thread of worry whispered in Jana\u2019s voice. \u201cA cop?\u201d</p><p>Their last encounter with a cop hadn\u2019t gone so well. But this time would be different. He realized he still had a hard grip on her hand. Zane forced himself to let her go. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby, he\u2019s on our side.\u201d</p><p>Then Tony was there. His glittering eyes swept over the group and lingered on Jana. \u201cMs. Carter?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. The red still lingered in her gaze. Her eyes appeared bloodshot now.</p><p>\u201cJana Carter, you\u2019re under arrest.\u201d Tony reached for her hand and hauled Jana to her feet.</p><p>\u201cNo, man, wait!\u201d The other cuff glinted between their outstretched hands.</p><p>But Tony shook his head. \u201cYou know she\u2019s going in.\u201d He jerked his thumb back at the burning building. \u201cSeriously, what the hell were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Jana laughed. A hollow, mocking sound. \u201cGuess he\u2019s not on our side.\u201d Her chin tilted up, just a bit. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s just on yours, hmm, demon? Use me, then throw me to the wolves.\u201d</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>Tony started reading Jana her rights. Fuck.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>The door to interrogation room three closed with a soft click. Jana took a deep breath. Not like this was the first time she had found herself in one of these tiny rooms, sitting at an old, scarred table, and facing off against a cop who wanted to throw her butt in jail.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Captain Antonio Young,\u201d the cop said, as he took a step closer to her.</p><p>\u201cWe know who the hell you are, Tony,\u201d Zane muttered from her side. Because, yeah, they were still handcuffed. Still locked together. Covered in soot and ash, they\u2019d been through fires hotter than those in hell, and they were still cuffed.</p><p>The cop-Tony-raised one dark brow. \u201cYou know who I am, Ms. Carter?\u201d</p><p>Well, she did now, so Jana kept her face expressionless. Oh, she hurt. Every part of her body ached, and she just wanted to crawl into bed and sleep for a week.</p><p>Preferably without being handcuffed to a demon.</p><p>But at least the cops had sent some food in to her and Zane. Only because of Zane\u2019s connections. Otherwise, Jana knew she never would have gotten those stale doughnuts and that coffee with the grounds floating at the top.</p><p>Tony pulled out the chair across from them, and its legs scraped against the floor. \u201cWhich one of you wants to tell me what the hell is going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I knew,\u201d Zane said instantly, \u201cI\u2019d tell you.\u201d Of course, he would. \u201cGood\u201d guys always liked to rat to cops.</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d Tony\u2019s dark eyes dropped to the handcuffs. The metal shined on the top of the table. \u201cGuessing those are P.P.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cP.P.?\u201d Was that frog\u2019s croak hers? Great. Her life was fandamn-tastic.</p><p>\u201cParanormal protected,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>So he knew. Good for him. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d she asked, straining to make her voice stronger. Damn smoke.</p><p>His gaze shifted to hers. \u201cI told you already, I\u2019m a police captain.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were so dark they almost looked black. The guy had a deep olive skin tone, a perfect face, and a voice like warm honey. \u201cYou an incubus?\u201d</p><p>He blinked and, wait, did his high cheeks redden?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s no damn incubus,\u201d Zane said and a thread of anger roughened the words. Sure, he\u2019d gone through the smoke, but he sounded perfectly normal. Demon strength and healing powers had their benefits. \u201cHe\u2019s human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t all be demons,\u201d the cop said quietly.</p><p>A human who knew Zane\u2019s secrets? Interesting.</p><p>Tony leaned forward. \u201cWhy\u2019d you attack my man, Zane?\u201d The question was fired fast.</p><p>His man? Oh, the other cop. \u201cBecause your man fired on us,\u201d Jana answered immediately, not waiting for Zane to respond. She wouldn\u2019t let Zane take the heat for this. Not when that cop had come out with his gun blazing.</p><p>Tony\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cBullshit. I gave an order\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you gave it all right,\u201d she shot back, her hands knotting into fists. \u201cDeadly force was fine as long as it was directed at Zane, right? What\u2019s a dead demon when\u2014\u201d</p><p>But the cop wasn\u2019t looking at her. He shook his head, slowly, and a deep furrow appeared between his eyes. \u201cHe fired on you?\u201d</p><p>Zane lifted his hand, raising the cuffs. \u201cFirst he tried to ... ah, break us apart with a bullet. When that didn\u2019t work, well, he said I was the expendable one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Not disbelief. Shock. Wait, did he believe what they were saying?</p><p>Jana glanced between them. \u201cYou ordered a hit on him, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEase up, princess,\u201d Tony said. What? Her eyes narrowed on him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a rat in my unit.\u201d Tony shook his head again, and his shoulders slumped a bit. \u201cWhat the hell is happening?\u201d</p><p>The guy was playing innocent, that was happening. She\u2019d never met an innocent cop. Plenty who were on the take. Plenty who knew how to look the other way, but innocent? No way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d the fire start at Night Watch?\u201d Tony asked, and that fast, the cop\u2019s eyes were back on her.</p><p>Jana shrugged. \u201cYou tell me, princess.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, just a fraction. \u201cYou\u2019re a wanted woman. How about I just go and throw you in a cage until it\u2019s time to haul you back to New Orleans?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTony,\u201d Zane\u2019s voice snarled, \u201cyou\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>She yanked on the cuffs. \u201cYou really going to throw us both in jail?\u201d</p><p>Tony put his hands on the table and leaned toward her. \u201cI know what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBored?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Jana!\u201d Zane\u2019s hand slapped on the table, making it shudder. \u201cJust let him\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re an Ignitor.\u201d Tony pressed closer. \u201cYou like the fire, don\u2019t you? You like to see those flames dance and destroy.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak. Beside her, Zane seemed to be all but vibrating with tension.</p><p>\u201cZane was going to turn you in at Night Watch, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d The cop\u2019s dark stare held hers. She could see the faintest flecks of gold around his pupils. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re cuffed. He was forcing you to come with him.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at Tony and didn\u2019t speak. Her hands flattened on the table.</p><p>\u201cThat made you angry, didn\u2019t it? You couldn\u2019t get him to let you go, and it pissed you off. And when Ignitors get pissed\u201d-a brief pause\u2014\u201cthings have a way of exploding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Zane gritted out. \u201cTrust me on this, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would.\u201d Tony\u2019s gaze slanted to Zane. \u201cBut I can\u2019t be sure if your brain\u2019s talking, or your dick.\u201d Her nails scraped over the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cYou left with her last night.\u201d Tony exhaled. \u201cYou stayed with her, all night. While you were cuffed, I\u2019m sure the two of you were playing ... nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was fucking drugged! I was out of my head, I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d Zane broke off and rolled his shoulders, as if he were shaking off the memory.</p><p>\u201cDrugged?\u201d Tony blinked. \u201cYou were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found my car, right?\u201d Zane\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cSome assholes hit us. Slammed into my \u2018Vette. They fired at us and caught me twice with some kind of drug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were the \u2018assholes'?\u201d</p><p>Jana shrugged. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ask your cop? You know, the one who was so eager to shoot Zane and take me into custody?\u201d She bared her teeth in a hard smile. \u201cI\u2019ll give you ten-to-one odds that he knows exactly who they are.\u201d</p><p>Tony glared back at her, but after a few moments, he eased away and turned on his heel, marching for the door.</p> <p>\u201cTony?\u201d Zane called.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find Harris,\u201d he said and yanked open the door. \u201cHe\u2019s the cop who pulled you over.\u201d The one who\u2019d tried to kill Zane.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you go find that little bastard,\u201d Zane said, and she heard the underlying threat in his voice. Find him and let me have him.</p><p>Jana didn\u2019t take a full breath until Tony left the room. When the door clicked closed behind him, the tension eased from her shoulders. Well, some of the tension eased.</p><p>Her gaze darted to the mirrored wall on the left side. Was she still being watched?</p><p>\u201cTony won\u2019t let anyone view us. He won\u2019t run the risk of them finding out what you are.\u201d</p><p>Jana glanced at him.</p><p>Zane ran a tired hand down his face, streaking the ash. \u201cWhat we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d She didn\u2019t have enhanced senses. She\u2019d never know if someone was there.</p><p>Zane tossed a glance at the mirror. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Okay. That was something. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here.\u201d Her palms were slick with sweat.</p><p>One brow climbed. \u201cBaby, we\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d He caught the edge of her chair and hauled her closer. \u201cThree hunters are dead. Dead. The Night Watch Agency was torched, torched right before-what a damn coincidence-you were scheduled to be turned in.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. Time to gamble. \u201cWe know it wasn\u2019t a coincidence.\u201d She risked a quick glance at the mirror. If someone was there, she was slitting her own throat. \u201dWe need to get out of here.\u201d A heated whisper.</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cYou tell me what\u2019s happening. Tell me who targeted Night Watch, my people.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d already warned him to walk away. He should have listened but, apparently, the demon didn\u2019t listen well. \u201cIf you know, you\u2019re dead.\u201d They wouldn\u2019t let him live. Demons were expendable to them.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby.\u201d His fingers brushed over her cheek. \u201cWhen I know, they\u2019re dead.\u201d Soft menace underscored the words.</p><p>The wooden chair was so hard beneath her. \u201cGet me out of here, and I\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, and we\u2019ll work on getting out.\u201d His fingers curled under her chin and tilted her head back. \u201cWas it those men in the semi?\u201d</p><p>Those men had been humans. They wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle an explosion that big. \u201cNo ... probably someone else in the unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe unit?\u201d</p><p>Her smile felt sad on her lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t really think you\u2019re the only hunter out there, do you?\u201d A hard, brittle laugh. \u201cWhile you\u2019re hunting your prey, who do you think is hunting you?\u201d</p><p>His brows climbed. \u201cThose jerks were humans. Humans can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome humans are very good at hunting.\u201d Especially if they forced someone else to do the grunt work. \u201cSome humans don\u2019t think demons and vampires and shifters deserve to live in this world. They think monsters should be put down, by any means necessary.\u201d She\u2019d been that means before.</p><p>\u201cThat right? And these ... hunters ... why do they want you?\u201d</p><p>She had to glance at the mirror. What if someone was watching? \u201cWhy do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re their weapon of choice?\u201d Disgust. \u201cAll they have to do is aim and you fire?\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t flinch. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get away from them for over a year. Why do you think I burned down that compound in New Orleans? They\u2019d been holding me there.\u201d</p><p>So many days stuck in that damn cell. Trapped.</p><p>Tony thought he\u2019d lock her up again? Oh, hell, no. No one would lock her up.</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You could have burned your way out any time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to see in order to burn.\u201d He knew that. \u201cThey kept me blindfolded or locked in a pitch-black cell.\u201d Hell wasn\u2019t always hot and bright. Sometimes it was dark ... and so quiet. \u201cThe first time they slipped, the first time the blindfold came off ...\u201d</p><p>She could still hear the screams. Jana licked her lips. \u201cTheir mistake. I got out.\u201d She\u2019d made sure she brought that building down behind her.</p><p>\u201cBut now they want you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like it.\u201d They were wasting time. One cop was already on their payroll. Where there was one, there were always half a dozen more. They\u2019d be at the station soon. Maybe posing as cops. Maybe dressed like lawyers. But they\u2019d be there to take her.</p><p>And what would happen to Zane?</p><p>\u201cGive me a name.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. Footsteps thudded outside the door. Tony was coming back.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes stayed locked on her. \u201cTell me who\u2019s after you. Tell me. \u201c</p><p>\u201cThey said-they said they were members of Project Perseus.\u201d Perseus. The guy from Greek mythology who\u2019d fought the monsters.</p><p>But some monsters didn\u2019t need to die.</p><p>\u201cDid you work with them? Did you kill for them?\u201d</p><p>Jana took a breath. The right side of your mouth kicks up when you lie. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cIf I stay here, they will come for me, and they\u2019ll kill anyone in their path.\u201d No telling how many cops they already had on their payroll. \u201cThey\u2019re framing me, forcing me against the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what-you want me to bust you out of jail? Baby, that\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA jail won\u2019t hold me.\u201d Simple. \u201cI can burn my way out, and I will.\u201d Because she wouldn\u2019t wait on them to come and get her.</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d He blew out a breath. \u201cNot when there\u2019s another way.\u201d</p><p>Hope began to stir in her chest. \u201cYou\u2019ll help me?\u201d His jaw clenched.</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d</p><p>The interrogation room door swung open. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d Tony marched inside, shaking his head. \u201cOfficer Harris seems to be missing from the hospital. He\u2019s not answering his cell, and no one knows where the hell he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to get out,\u201d Jana said. Didn\u2019t he see what was happening? Another Ignitor ... or a damn powerful demon ... had set the fire at Night Watch. It was only a matter of time until they came for her.</p><p>A setup. The team after her must have bugged the phone lines at Night Watch. They\u2019d known she was coming. They\u2019d started that fire for her.</p><p>Why? So that the cops would haul her to the station? Of course, the cops on scene would pick her as suspect number one. With her history, there was no way they wouldn\u2019t have hauled her in for questioning.</p><p>Those bastards knew that.</p><p>Zane\u2019s fingers tapped on the tabletop. \u201cI need to be on the streets, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be. She can\u2019t.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cThis case is shit. We both know the woman gets off on the fire, are you sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what gets her off.\u201d Zane\u2019s voice. Cold and hard.</p><p>\u201cYou know better than to let the case get personal.\u201d Tony stalked around the table and grabbed Zane\u2019s arm. He hauled Zane to his feet, grabbing for the cuffs. \u201cLet\u2019s find a way out of these damned things and you can get on the streets. You can find Harris for me\u2014\u201d</p><p>He never finished his sentence. Zane\u2019s fist plowed into Tony\u2019s jaw, and the cop went down. Hard.</p><p>Jana jumped to her feet. \u201dWhat are you doing?\u201d She\u2019d thought the cop was his friend.</p><p>Zane pulled her forward as he rolled Tony onto his back. \u201cI\u2019m making sure we get out before the bastards after you get to us.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d attacked a cop. Not a very \u201cgood\u201d guy thing to do.</p><p>Zane glanced back at her. \u201cThey herded you to the station. They\u2019re going to be sending someone for you. Maybe Feds, maybe someone pretending to be Feds, but they\u2019ll have paperwork, all nice and neat, saying they can take you into custody.\u201d He paused. \u201cThey\u2019ll take you, and no one will see you again.\u201d</p><p>No, he was wrong. They\u2019d take her ... and they\u2019d use her. The price for her life would be death for others.</p><p>\u201cCome on, we need to get the hell out of here.\u201d He frowned down at the cop. \u201cSorry, Tony.\u201d</p><p>Sorry? Sorry? \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get to deny helping us escape. He\u2019ll have the bruise to prove he was hit. He\u2019ll be clear....\u201d Zane hurried away from the table, pulling her with him. \u201cAnd, in a few minutes, so will we.\u201d</p><p>His fingers curled around the doorknob.</p><p>She grabbed his shoulder. \u201cThis place will be crawling with cops! We won\u2019t be able to just walk out, we can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony sent \u2018em away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, baby, trust me on this, okay? Tony knows the deal around here. When he found out Harris was missing, he knew what was going down. Hell, why do you think he came close enough for me to hit?\u201d</p><p>The cop had wanted them to escape? Since when did a cop want someone to break out?</p><p>\u201cNot like it\u2019s the first time we played this game. ...\u201d Zane inched open the door and gave a nod. \u201cAll right, we\u2019re gonna have to move quickly. Don\u2019t fight me. Whatever I do, just go with it, okay?\u201d</p><p>She would have gone with just about anything right then. She nodded her head in agreement and then realized he couldn\u2019t see the move. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn three...\u201d</p><p>He began to softly whisper the count, and when he got to three, they ran into the hall, darting fast in a series of twists and turns. The place looked deserted, but she could hear voices, phones. She kept her head down and followed Zane, moving as quickly as she could.</p><p>Five more feet, and they were at a door with a red exit sign. Go, go. Footsteps tapped behind them.</p><p>Zane shoved open the door and yanked her across the threshold. The door shut with a clang behind them.</p><p>Jana\u2019s head was pressed against Zane\u2019s chest. She could hear the fierce pounding of his heart, racing so fast.</p><p>\u201cStay behind me,\u201d he murmured, and then he pulled back. They eased down two flights of stairs, going deeper into the bowels of the precinct.</p><p>Minutes later, they came out in the garage. Squad cars were scattered around, waiting.</p><p>Time to steal another ride?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Zane said. \u201cThe second we vanish in one of those, every cop in the area will be after us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are we going to do?\u201d Someone would be raising the alarm any minute, she knew it, she knew\u2014</p><p>\u201cSee that door? It leads to the alley. Come on, move that sweet ass, baby.\u201d</p><p>She hauled ass.</p><p>A hard push from Zane, and the door flew open. They stumbled outside. She looked to the left, to the right, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cDamn, hoss, it took you long enough,\u201d a deep voice rumbled and Jana froze. \u201cI was starting to think I\u2019d have to come in and haul your sorry hide out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane grunted and headed for the big, blond guy-the guy from Night Watch. The shifter who\u2019d gone into the fire with them. The guy stood next to a green pickup truck, his arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy to slip out of a police station as it is to slip into one,\u201d Zane said and opened the passenger side door.</p><p>Jana jumped in as the blond hurried around the truck and opened the driver\u2019s side door. She had to ask, \u201cHow did you know we\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTony called. He said you needed a ride.\u201d The shifter fired up the engine. \u201cLucky for you, I was in the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve played this game. Huh. The cop really had been helping them.</p><p>Zane crowded in on the other side and she was squeezed between the two big, masculine frames. The blond hit the gas and the truck sped forward. \u201cGot orders from Pak to take you to a safe house. He wants you to stay there until we can get this shit straightened out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many dead, Jude?\u201d Zane demanded.</p><p>Jana licked her lips.</p> <p>\u201cFive total,\u201d the guy-Jude-said. \u201cYou got the rest out.\u201d</p><p>Five people. Why had they died? To teach her a lesson? Her hands fisted and her nails bit into her palms. She\u2019d make sure the bastards paid for this.</p><p>\u201cThey knew we were coming, Jude,\u201d Zane said and his arm rubbed against hers. Hell, his whole body rubbed against hers. That strong thigh was pressed to her leg.</p><p>\u201cThey probably tapped the line,\u201d Jana forced herself to say what she suspected.</p><p>Jude grunted. \u201cMaybe. Pak\u2019s doing a housecleaning. There\u2019s no way that fire should have started, not with our security systems in place.\u201d</p><p>A housecleaning?</p> <p>Jude turned a hard left, and the truck drove down a long, narrow road. \u201cLady, if you\u2019re such a badass, why\u2019d you go running into the fire?\u201d</p><p>She lifted the cuffs. \u201cI didn\u2019t exactly have much choice.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s finger touched the edge of her mouth, and she realized that the right side of her lip had hitched up.</p><p>Lie.</p><p>She swallowed.</p><p>Zane edged closer to her. His breath feathered over her ear when he said, \u201cAs soon as I get you alone, you\u2019re telling me everything. Everything.\u201d</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t want to hear her secrets, and she didn\u2019t want to tell them. Sometimes, she liked to forget who she was, and what she\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cThey made it personal,\u201d he said, the words dark and deadly and a shiver slipped over her. \u201cThey came after my people, and they\u2019re damn well going to pay.\u201d</p> <p>She turned and met his stare. Black, not green. The demon was out to play. \u201cI tell you, and then you let me go?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d broken her out of jail. That had to mean something, didn\u2019t it?</p><p>He held her stare. His expression never changed. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>And this time, she was the one who knew: lie.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are they?\u201d</p><p>Antonio cracked open one eye at the screeching voice. He was flat on the floor, and his jaw ached like a bitch.</p><p>He\u2019d also spent the last five minutes pretending to be out cold. Like Zane could really take me with one punch. The guy thought he had a fist of steel-not so much. Especially not since Zane had a tendency to pull his punches with friends.</p><p>Antonio let a moan break from his lips, and he made a show of pushing himself off the floor. \u201cWh-what...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Did he sound weak enough? Maybe.</p><p>He squinted and allowed his gaze to drift around the room. He saw the shoes first. Two-inch black heels. Long legs. His gaze rose. A woman stood in the doorway of the interrogation room. Her dark blond hair was pulled back at her nape. Her green eyes glittered-oh, yeah, a lot of rage there.</p><p>A man was behind her, tall, balding, and peering over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Antonio asked as he rose to his feet. He shifted his jaw. Zane hadn\u2019t pulled the punch that much. \u201cWhat the-where the hell are the prisoners?\u201d</p><p>The woman shook her head. \u201cYou expect me to believe this bull?\u201d</p><p>He stumbled and his legs rammed into the thick table.</p><p>A badge was slapped onto the table. \u201cFBI Special Agent Kelly Thomas.\u201d Her red nails tapped the badge. \u201cI\u2019m here to pick up your prisoner, Jana Carter.\u201d She paused a beat. \u201cAnd you\u2019d better tell me that Ms. Carter is just down the hall, getting fingerprinted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... don\u2019t remember.... Something hit me....\u201d</p><p>She swore and spun around, colliding with the guy. \u201cThey\u2019re gone! Christ, we\u2019ve got to call headquarters.\u201d</p><p>The guy jerked out his phone and began punching numbers.</p><p>She tossed a hard glare back at Antonio. \u201cCaptain Young, you\u2019ve made a serious mistake.\u201d \u201cMistake? Lady, I was assaulted!\u201d</p><p>Her lips curled in disgust. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know about you? You chose the wrong side.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders straightened. \u201cAnd what side would that be?\u201d</p><p>She snatched back her badge. \u201cThe side with the freaks. You want to screw with them, that\u2019s your mistake.\u201d Screw with them?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake that I\u2019ll make sure you regret,\u201d she promised.</p><p>He waited until the lady and her partner stormed out, then he took out his phone. Two seconds later, he\u2019d connected to the most powerful man in Baton Rouge. \u201cHey, Pak. I got a name for you. Kelly Thomas.\u201d He listened a moment and then said, \u201cYou were right, she came for the Ignitor.\u201d</p><p>The FBI agent would realize soon enough ... he never did a damn thing that he regretted. Could she say the same thing?</p><p>They were dropped off in the swamp and left at a cabin that lurked on the edge of darkness. Another cabin. Only this one looked much better than their last shelter.</p><p>\u201cYour place?\u201d Zane asked Jude when he climbed out of the truck. \u201cDoes Erin know about this?\u201d Jana followed him around the front of the truck. Who was Erin? Another hunter?</p><p>\u201cUh ...\u201d Jude blinked slowly. \u201cAre you asking if the assistant district attorney knows that I just aided and abetted an escape from the Baton Rouge Police Department?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Jude tossed him a set of keys. \u201cSure she does. The woman knows everything I do.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s fingers curled around the keys. \u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>A wide smile, one that flashed with lots of sharp, white teeth, stretched Jude\u2019s mouth. \u201cNow we\u2019re even, demon.\u201d</p><p>Until next time.</p><p>\u201cA motorcycle is around back, with helmets. If you two need to make a quick exit ... well, just watch your asses.\u201d \u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLay low, Zane. At least until we figure out who we\u2019re up against.\u201d</p><p>Jana felt Zane\u2019s stare shift to her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll be figuring out this game very soon.\u201d</p><p>He thought she\u2019d tell him. He wanted all the dirty little secrets, and he deserved to know.</p><p>She just ... didn\u2019t want him to know the truth. But, really, what was a little death between two friends? Not that they were actually friends....</p><p>The other hunter drove away. Dusk was coming, falling fast, and bringing a chill to the air. They went inside and, though the place was small, Jana was happy to see a clean bed. And food. Sweet, blessed food.</p><p>And ... a bathroom. With a shower. Oh, heaven.</p><p>\u201cI want to know about Project Perseus.\u201d</p><p>Of course he did.</p><p>\u201cTell me who the big players are. Tell me what the hell they want.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to talk then. It had truly been a pisser of a day. Jana began to strip.</p><p>Beside her, Zane stiffened. \u201cAh ... what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He was a bright demon. Surely he could figure this out. She kicked off her shoes. Shoved off her socks. Then her fingers went to the buckle on her jeans.</p><p>\u201cJana!\u201d</p><p>The jeans hit the floor. She kept her panties on, for now. Jana slanted him a fast look. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed\u201d\u2014but she was sure he had\u2014\u201cI\u2019m covered in ash, grime, blood, and who the hell knows what else. I\u2019m showering.\u201d She took a nice, slow breath. \u201cAnd since you\u2019re stuck to me, you\u2019re coming in, too.\u201d Zane. Hot water. Naked flesh.</p><p>Things were about to get wild.</p><p>Just what she wanted. What she needed.</p><p>No past. No secrets. Just them.</p><p>\u201cDo me a favor?\u201d she whispered and raised her brows. The cuffs would be a problem for her, but there was a way around them. All he had to do was ... \u201cRip my shirt off?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The word broke from Zane, more a growl than anything else.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t really shower with it. Can\u2019t get it off over the cuffs.\u201d She shrugged and gave him a smile that sent all of his blood rushing down south. \u201cRip it for me?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed and his gaze dropped to her panties. Black panties that were little more than a scrap of silk. \u201cWe don\u2019t ... have to do that.\u201d The fingers of his right hand uncurled. Jude, bless him, curse him, had slipped him a key. \u201cI\u2019ve got your ticket to freedom, baby.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and a pleased smile blossomed on her lips. Damn. She was gorgeous when she smiled.</p><p>He lifted the cuffs. He shoved the key in, and the lock snicked as the cuffs sprang open.</p><p>Then they were free. The cuffs fell to the floor.</p><p>Jana stared up at him. Her legs were curvy, smooth, and he wanted to touch them. No, he wanted to spread them and drive fierce and hard inside.</p><p>He\u2019d been chained to the woman for over twenty-four hours, and he\u2019d been hard for her most of that time.</p><p>Focus. There were questions that needed to be asked. Answers he had to get.</p><p>But Jana was lifting the edge of her shirt, revealing her midriff, and he wasn\u2019t about to look away. He\u2019d never pretended to be a saint, and he was horny as hell right then.</p><p>She tossed the shirt to the floor. Her bra matched the panties and the upper curves of her breasts thrust against the black material. The woman had great breasts. Round and firm. What color were her nipples? What would they taste like?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dirty, Zane.\u201d He blinked. Ah ...</p><p>\u201cYou might as well shower with me.\u201d Then she turned away, her hips rolling in a tempting sway as she headed for the bathroom. As she walked, her hands lifted and she unhooked the bra. It fell in her wake. She glanced back at him. \u201cNo drugs are controlling you this time. You know what you\u2019re doing now. So do I.\u201d</p><p>At the bathroom door, she ditched her panties.</p><p>His breath hissed out, and his hands fisted.</p><p>A moment later, the water roared on. His eyes squeezed shut. She\u2019d be sliding under that water soon, the liquid dripping down her body. Covering every inch of her pale flesh.</p><p>If he went in that bathroom, he\u2019d take her. He\u2019d drive into her until they both came, until the need that had been riding him finally eased.</p><p>Sex wasn\u2019t part of the plan. Sex wasn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>Fuck it. His eyes flew open, and he bounded across the room in two seconds. He yanked off his shirt. Kicked off his shoes and socks. Lost his jeans ...</p><p>He wrenched back the shower curtain and saw her. Wet hair. Water glistening on her face. On her body.</p><p>Pink nipples. Like ripe cherries. He\u2019d always liked cherries.</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d Jana whispered as she reached for him.</p><p>Her fingers were wet and warm. Her flesh so soft. He took her mouth, driving his tongue past her lips even as the water pounded down on him.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to fuck her from the first moment he saw her. They\u2019d been surrounded by fire-and he\u2019d wanted her.</p><p>Zane wasn\u2019t used to denying himself pleasures. He\u2019d tried to hold back with her, but it just wasn\u2019t his way. Taking, that was him.</p><p>His fingers curved around her hips. She had a fantastic ass. An ass that had driven him crazy. But...</p><p>His tongue thrust against hers. Zane caught her gasp and he lifted her, easing her back against the tiled wall.</p><p>Her thighs parted. Smooth, pale thighs. Thighs that had hugged his hips on that motorcycle. They\u2019d clung so well, and he\u2019d wanted them wrapped around his waist as he thrust deep into her.</p><p>Not a safe woman to want. He knew that. But then, he wasn\u2019t a safe guy.</p><p>His fingers slipped between her legs, and he found the hot core of her body. He eased one finger inside her. Tight. Sweet hell. She\u2019d feel so damn good around his cock. He pushed another finger inside her, and she tensed.</p><p>His lips broke from hers. \u201cEasy.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were wide, the pupils big, and red stained her cheeks. But she shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want easy.\u201d Husky, sensual, like whispered sex.</p><p>She widened her stance, giving him better, deeper access. \u201cJust because I\u2019m human\u201d-a light laugh\u2014\u201cI won\u2019t break.\u201d</p><p>Good to know.</p><p>Jana licked his neck, and then he felt the press of her teeth on his flesh. Yes. His cock jerked, and his fingers thrust harder into her sex.</p><p>Her breath panted out, and she arched against him. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d give her as much as she could handle.</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d</p><p>He shifted before her, curling over her, and he took one tight nipple into his mouth. She tasted incredible. Better than cherries. Much better. He sucked her, tonguing the nipple, and her sex squeezed his fingers.</p><p>Oh, yeah, this was going to be good.</p><p>Jana\u2019s nails dug into his shoulders as he enjoyed her nipples. Sucking, licking, letting her feel the edge of his teeth.</p><p>Vampires weren\u2019t the only ones who liked to bite.</p><p>There were no tender touches, no soft looks between them. The heat was too intense, and this-this was no sweet, romantic union. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sex. Need. Lust.</p><p>He lifted her high against the wall. She wrapped her silky legs around him, and his cock pushed against the eager entrance of her sex.</p><p>Fuck-condom.</p> <p>Almost snarling, he jerked back.</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d</p><p>He picked her up in his arms and strode out of the bathroom. The woman didn\u2019t weigh a damn thing. He lowered her onto the bed, admired the view of the pink flesh between her legs, and he yanked open the nightstand drawer.</p><p>Come on, Jude. Don\u2019t let me-ah. A box of condoms waited inside the drawer. Zane was back to owing the guy.</p><p>He snatched one out, ripped open the package and rolled the condom over his cock. Jana watched him with those wide eyes, her lips full and red.</p> <p>Want them on me.</p><p>Next time, he\u2019d make sure he got her to use that sexy mouth on him.</p><p>But for now ... His fingers curled around her thighs, and he spread her wider. With one hand, he guided his cock to her entrance. He stared down at her, saw the need and the driving lust in her eyes.</p><p>A match for me.</p><p>He thrust into her, a long, hard plunge. Her moan filled his ears, and her legs locked tightly around him. Harder, deeper, he drove into her. Again and again. The mattress dipped beneath them, her nails raked his back, and the hunger spiraled higher, hotter.</p><p>His hand eased between their bodies. He found her clit and stroked that tight bud. Her head tipped back, those breasts begging for his mouth, and he leaned over her and licked her nipple even as he plunged into her.</p> <p>Deep.</p><p>Her sex squeezed him, so fucking tight. In. Out. In.</p><p>\u201cZane ...\u201d The whisper of his name. Her sex grew slicker around him as her body tensed. Her climax was close.</p><p>He wanted to feel her come. Would feel her.</p><p>His thumb pressed against her clit even as he thrust into her once more. She came, a hard ripple of pleasure around him, and her face went blank with pleasure.</p><p>Yes. Her inner muscles squeezed his cock.</p><p>And his control broke. He shoved into her, as deep as he could go. Again and again. Her scent surrounded him. Her body was crushed beneath his, and her sex-so warm and wet and-he was fucking going out of his mind.</p><p>Good.</p> <p>Hell. Better than good.</p><p>His balls tightened. He slammed into her once more. Then he climaxed, shouting her name. Pleasure pounded through him, a release so intense his whole body shuddered. Pretty damn perfect. The heat seared him to the core.</p><p>She pretended to sleep. Jana lay in Zane\u2019s arms, her eyes closed, her breath slow and easy, and she forced her body to stay relaxed.</p><p>He\u2019d left her only long enough to shed the condom. He\u2019d fed her. Brought her sandwiches from the kitchen. And now he held her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to talk to him. Didn\u2019t want to answer all the questions she knew he had.</p><p>What was the point of talking? Lies would do them no good.</p><p>Her body still ached, a good, delicious ache. Her sex shivered every few moments with little aftershocks of pleasure that hummed through her system.</p><p>The demon was good in bed. Not really surprising.</p><p>What was surprising ... she wanted him again. Now.</p><p>It was dangerous to want something-or someone-too much. She knew that. Wanting could make you weak.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted the sex. Wanted the blast of pleasure and the rush of release that would let her forget, even for a few moments, the life that was hers.</p><p>And she\u2019d wanted him. Not some nameless stranger from a bar. A man who didn\u2019t know how dangerous his lover was. Zane.</p><p>Because he knew what lurked inside of her.</p><p>But with the passion sated, he\u2019d be back to business again. She wouldn\u2019t tell him the truth. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Her left arm was thrown out over the pillow. No more handcuffs.</p><p>Jana breathed slowly. Zane hadn\u2019t moved in the last five minutes. His breathing was light, steady. Just like mine.</p><p>She risked lifting her lashes, just a crack. His eyes were closed. In sleep, his face was just as hard. Just as dangerous. No softening in slumber for him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let herself forget what he was. Demon. One who\u2019d come hunting for her. Sex wouldn\u2019t change anything for him. When the time came, he\u2019d still turn her over to Night Watch and he wouldn\u2019t look back.</p><p>So she wouldn\u2019t look back, either.</p><p>Slowly, carefully, she eased away from him and off the bed. He shifted a bit, his hand reaching out to follow her, and she froze.</p><p>His fingers curled around her pillow, and the frown that had appeared between his brows eased away. Jana started breathing again.</p><p>She scooped up her clothes, hopped over the handcuffs on the floor, and crept for the door. No need to waste time looking for the keys to the motorcycle. She\u2019d hotwire the ride and be out of there in no time.</p><p>But at the door, she hesitated and glanced back at Zane. His tan body was surrounded by the stark white sheets. He looked sexy, rumpled.</p><p>She swallowed. Staying with him wasn\u2019t an option. She knew that. Sex had been fun-okay a lot more than fun-but it couldn\u2019t ever be more than a good time.</p><p>Bad things happened to people when they got too close to her. Most of \u2018em couldn\u2019t stand the heat.</p><p>Good-bye, Zane. She couldn\u2019t let him turn her in, and he would. Once he\u2019d gotten the info he wanted about Project Perseus, he\u2019d go back to collecting his bounty. And what would she do? Live the rest of her days in a cage?</p><p>No.</p><p>Jana dressed and then slipped out of the cabin. No more looking back.</p><p>Zane waited until he heard the soft click of the door closing, then he let his eyes open. His hand smoothed over the sheets that were still warm from Jana\u2019s body.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t waited long to turn tail and run. Hot sex, slambam, then she\u2019d been gone.</p><p>He\u2019d expected her to run, but ...</p><p>I\u2019d hoped I was wrong.</p><p>Innocent people didn\u2019t run. He\u2019d learned that lesson a long time ago.</p><p>Anger began to churn in his gut. The woman had thought he\u2019d be blinded by the sex. That she\u2019d just be able to slip right past him.</p><p>Think again.</p><p>He rose from the bed and marched to the table. Jude had left a cell phone for him. He punched in the shifter\u2019s number. Jude answered on the second ring, just as Zane heard the roar of a motorcycle\u2019s engine flare to life outside.</p><p>At least she had a helmet this time.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on the move,\u201d he said, running a hand down his face.</p><p>\u201cWe put a tag on the bike. We\u2019ll be able to follow every move that she makes. Get dressed.\u201d</p><p>Follow because the motorcycle had been a lure for Jana, and she\u2019d taken the bait. No, she was the bait, and he hadn\u2019t even realized what game Night Watch intended to play with her until he\u2019d arrived at the cabin, and Jude had mentioned the motorcycle.</p><p>Why tell a bounty about an escape vehicle unless you wanted her to escape? And then, when Jude had tossed him the keys ... one glance at the shifter\u2019s blue stare and he\u2019d known exactly what Pak wanted them to do.</p><p>Let her run. Let her think she was safe. Then track her.</p><p>Because while Jana hadn\u2019t started the fire at Night Watch, she was tied to those flames. The bastards who had set the fire were after her. If Jude and Zane watched her, if they followed her, they\u2019d find the murdering assholes they wanted. Because those assholes would come after her again.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked Jude, as he yanked open the door.</p><p>A green pickup shuddered to a stop right in front of the cabin. Zane lowered the phone. Of course, the shifter would have stayed close.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Jude yelled through his open window. \u201cI\u2019ve got the GPS linkup in the truck.\u201d</p><p>Zane slammed the cabin\u2019s door and hurried around the vehicle. He jumped inside, and seconds later, they were racing away from the swamp. He realized his knuckles ached because his hands were clenched so tightly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect her to run so fast,\u201d Jude said as his gaze flickered to Zane.</p><p>\u201cNeither did I.\u201d And, yeah, stupidly, he\u2019d actually hoped she wouldn\u2019t run. He\u2019d hoped Pak and Jude were wrong, that their plan wouldn\u2019t work. He\u2019d wanted to open his eyes and see Jana lying next to him, and he\u2019d wanted her to tell him about Project Perseus. Wanted all her secrets.</p><p>Fucking delusional.</p><p>\u201cYou slept with her, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched.</p><p>\u201cCome on, hoss, you sleep with every attractive woman you meet.\u201d Jude whistled as he turned the wheel to the left. \u201cI just didn\u2019t expect you to screw a killer.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes cut to Jude. \u201dWatch it.\u201d His voice was lethal and the power within him built, shoving against the bonds of his control.</p><p>Jude\u2019s gaze darted to him. \u201cWhat? A friend can\u2019t tell you that you\u2019re fucking up? With her, you\u2019re crossing the line.\u201d</p><p>He knew that, but walking away hadn\u2019t been an option. Taking her had been the only choice.</p><p>Then she\u2019d walked away. But he\u2019d get her back.</p><p>\u201cYou know, she could be working with them.\u201d Jude\u2019s voice was softer now. The truck shot past the pine trees, blurring their limbs. \u201cNot once have they tried to actually hurt her. Even the cop tried to shoot you, not her.\u201d</p><p>So Jude had already talked to Tony and gotten all those details, too. Figured. \u201cShe\u2019s scared of them.\u201d He\u2019d seen the fear in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat woman? She\u2019s scared of something? You sure about that? She didn\u2019t seem like the fearful type to me.\u201d</p><p>Zane realized he could still smell her. Her scent was all over his skin. Hell, no wonder Jude realized they\u2019d slept together. No way a shifter nose could miss the scent of sex. \u201cShe\u2019s afraid of someone.\u201d Not something.</p><p>Afraid and angry.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a chance she could just turn tail and slip out of the city.\u201d Jude\u2019s fingers were tight around the wheel. \u201cPak said if she does, we stop her and bring her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t leave Baton Rouge, and she\u2019s not just going to sit there and wait for them to come after her.\u201d Zane was certain of that. \u201cShe\u2019ll fight.\u201d I can still hear their screams.</p><p>They hit the highway. Jude glanced down at the GPS and turned right. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I figured.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut whoever we\u2019re up against, these bastards were strong enough to level Night Watch, even with the protections we had on the place.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like this was the first time Night Watch had come under attack. But it was the first time anyone had made it past the high-tech security and the paranormal charms that protected the place.</p><p>He licked his lips \u2014tasted her. Damn her. She shouldn\u2019t have left. She\u2019d tried to distract him with sex. Yeah, that had worked. Then the moment she\u2019d thought he was weak, she\u2019d left him.</p><p>\u201cShe could be walking right into hell,\u201d Zane said. Going in alone. \u201cShe said they had her before, but that she managed to get away....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Pak couldn\u2019t find any intel on Project Perseus. So either its cover is too good or\u2014\u201d</p><p>Or Jana was bullshitting him.</p><p>One way to find out. \u201cHurry the hell up, Jude. We don\u2019t want to give our Ignitor too much of a head start.\u201d I\u2019m coming, baby. Are you ready?</p><p>When Jana got back to Baton Rouge, she didn\u2019t stick to the shadows. She drove the motorcycle right down the main roads, revved her engine as loud as she could, and hoped the bastards would find her.</p><p>She was in the mood for some heat.</p><p>It was after midnight, but the city wasn\u2019t sleeping. Far from it. Jana knew just where to go in order to find the trouble she sought.</p><p>Four turns later, a fast blast into the darker side of town, and she braked in front of Dusk. Demon Central. One thing about demons ... the lower-level demons were such sellouts. Always willing to turn on a friend or, hell, anyone. It hadn\u2019t just been coincidence that the big rig had hit them after they left Dusk.</p><p>Someone had made a phone call. Someone had fed the bastards her location, even given a description of the car she and Zane had been using.</p><p>That someone was about to feel her fire.</p><p>She jumped off the motorcycle. Once she\u2019d gotten back to the city, she\u2019d taken twenty minutes to run by her place and change clothes. No one had jumped out to confront her. Pity. She\u2019d been ready for them.</p><p>Now she wore black. Tight shirt. Long jeans. And boots made for kicking ass.</p><p>She strolled up to the bouncer. He glanced her way, a quick gauge to see if she was using glamour. When he realized she wasn\u2019t, he hesitated until she shoved a fifty into his hand.</p><p>Then he let her into the demons\u2019 den.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Zane reached for door handle. Jude grabbed his arm. \u201cEasy, man. Easy. She just walked inside. No way has she made contact with anyone yet.\u201d \u201cThis is the place where those demons jumped me!\u201d \u201cDemons are always jumping you.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t take his gaze off the door. \u201cThis was different. It was a trap. They\u2019d been waiting for me. If I\u2019d gone into that place ...\u201d</p><p>How many would have come at him?</p><p>\u201cYou would have ass-kicked your way out?\u201d Jude asked dryly.</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cYeah.\u201d He would have. \u201cSo why didn\u2019t you go in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe stopped me.\u201d You shouldn\u2019t go in there. Yet she\u2019d just strolled in, rolling those sexy hips. \u201cShe said that there was a hit on me, that the vamps and demons had been wanting her to take me out.\u201d Only she hadn\u2019t taken the hit on him. She\u2019d never come at him with fire in her eyes. Not once. Not even when he\u2019d cuffed her.</p><p>For a supposedly cold-blooded killer, that didn\u2019t make a lick of sense.</p><p>\u201cSo there was a hit, she didn\u2019t take it, and the woman tried to protect you?\u201d Jude\u2019s fingers drummed on the wheel. \u201cInteresting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane rolled his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSo in return for her bit of community service, what did you do?\u201d Jude asked. \u201cI cuffed her.\u201d</p><p>The bark of laughter came fast and hard from the shifter. Zane didn\u2019t glance his way. His eyes were on the club. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be in there alone.\u201d \u201cRelax. Nothing\u2019s happened yet.\u201d</p> <p>His back teeth clenched. \u201cHow the hell do you know that from out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t smell any smoke. Your lady hasn\u2019t started having her fun.\u201d</p><p>Jana stood in the middle of the den, her gaze darting to the dark corners and closed doors. The demons were so strung out here. Her nose ached from all the bitter scents. Demons and drugs ... sometimes, there wasn\u2019t any other way for them to shut out the darkness.</p><p>She knew a lot about darkness.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a bar in the place. No band, either. Why pretend? The people there wanted only one thing.</p> <p>Pleasure. The sweet release the drugs would give them.</p><p>Her gaze tracked to the right. She needed to find a familiar face ... ah.</p><p>Demon number one on her list. The demon with the scar sliding down his right cheek, one of the demons who\u2019d come charging at her and Zane. Also one of the demons who\u2019d been so quick to flee when he realized Zane wasn\u2019t going down.</p><p>She stalked toward him. The guy blinked at her, and narrowed his eyes. \u201cI ... I know you.\u201d</p><p>Jana took a breath and let the fire heat her blood. She knew her eyes would redden. \u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>His jaw dropped, and he tried to scramble back. A low-level demon, he wouldn\u2019t be any match for her flames. Her power would easily subdue his.</p> <p>\u201cNot so fast.\u201d She gave him a slow smile. \u201cI just want to talk.\u201d She reached for him, and he swore at the heat in her touch.</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t... I didn\u2019t know they were tryin\u2019 to kill you!\u201d The words burst from him and spittle flew from his mouth. \u201cI heard-heard there was money if an Ig-Ignitor was spotted.... Just wa-wanted some cash!\u201d</p><p>Now, really, that had been sickeningly easy. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAsshole, what\u2019s your name?\u201d She knew he\u2019d see the flames in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cM-Morns ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d you call, Morris?\u201d</p><p>He stared up at her, his black eyes bulging. \u201cThey\u2019ll ... kill me.\u201d Whispered.</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cAnd what? You think I won\u2019t?\u201d She leaned in close. His back was slammed against the wall. No place for him to go. \u201cI can burn this whole place down before you can blink.\u201d</p><p>Morris started to shake. \u201cH-had a cell number ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Another owlish stare.</p><p>She sighed. Great. \u201cDo you still have your cell phone?\u201d A few jerky nods.</p><p>\u201cThen get the damn phone out and call the bastards again.\u201d The number would still be on his phone. She jabbed her index finger into his chest. \u201cTell \u2018em that you found their Ignitor, that she\u2019s pissed, and that she\u2019s burning a den.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-burning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your boys made a few mistakes the other night. You ratted me out, and I really don\u2019t like it when folks betray me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you said you wouldn\u2019t t-take the j-job.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so he\u2019d heard that part somewhere, too. Wasn\u2019t he the informed demon flunky?</p><p>\u201cThe second mistake\u201d-she waited a beat and let the charge grow\u2014\u201cYou came after my demon.\u201d</p><p>His bushy brows bobbed. \u201cYour\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake your call.\u201d Jana felt the heat begin to rise. \u201cThen you\u2019d better get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>Because it looked like the only way to stop those assholes on her tail was to show them that they did not want her. They needed to see that they couldn\u2019t control her, and if they came too close, she\u2019d exterminate them.</p><p>Demons began to run out of the den. \u201cOh, hell,\u201d Jude muttered. Zane\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmoke,\u201d Jude said, and an instant later, Zane caught the scent.</p><p>Fire. Zane shoved open the door and rushed out of the truck.</p><p>\u201cWait! Zane, dammit, wait!\u201d</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t waiting. Jana was in there, the fire was raging, and he wasn\u2019t just going to sit outside and watch everything burn.</p><p>A demon slammed into him. A guy with pale cheeks and a long, twisting scar on the right side of his face. When his gaze met Zane\u2019s, the demon began to scream.</p><p>A hard hand grabbed Zane\u2019s shoulder and spun him around. The demon ran away, still screaming.</p><p>\u201cThe woman controls fire. She can handle this,\u201d Jude snapped at him, not releasing his hold. \u201cIt\u2019s not like she\u2019s some delicate flower. She\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBait?\u201d he bit out as the smoke drifted from the open door of the den. \u201cShe\u2019s just bait so it doesn\u2019t matter what happens to her?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what the fuck she is.\u201d And, friend or not, he let his fist swing out. Jude stumbled back, probably more in surprise than anything else because it was hard to knock a shifter on his ass. Zane whirled and ran for the den.</p><p>He shoved demons out of his way. Knocked them to the side and shouted Jana\u2019s name.</p><p>The crackle of fire answered him.</p><p>Inside, he didn\u2019t see anyone. Human or demon. Just an empty den. Had she gone out the back? Had she\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d She appeared in the thick smoke and came toward him with eyes flashing red.</p><p>He grabbed her arm and pulled her close. \u201cAnd you damn well know better than to start a fire around you.\u201d His hold was as strong as the cuffs had been, and he hauled her toward the door. She shouldn\u2019t be around the smoke for too long, she knew that. Did the woman have a death wish?</p><p>They burst outside, into the night. The other demons had fled the scene, desperate to escape from the flames.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Jana said again, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d His fury broke free. \u201cWhere should I be? Still at the cabin where you left my ass? Still sleeping off the sex while you get to burn this place to ash? I don\u2019t think so, baby.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. For an instant, she almost looked ... hurt. But then, \u201cI was cleaning up your mess, demon. These assholes attacked you, remember? Were you just going to let them go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Now that was just insulting. \u201cI handle my own business, my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Her hands were on her hips. The building burned behind her. \u201cYour way wasn\u2019t working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd burning the building down around them was gonna work? That\u2019s execution, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave them a chance to run!\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d Her shoulders slumped a bit.</p><p>\u201cNews flash.\u201d He stepped closer to her, making her tilt her head back to hold his stare. \u201cWherever you are, I\u2019m gonna be there.\u201d His breath rasped out. \u201cDid you really think I\u2019d just let you walk away? From the moment you slipped out of bed, I knew every move you made.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cYou ... this is a setup?\u201d</p><p>His gut clenched. All or nothing. \u201cYou\u2019re the bait, baby. The juicy, tempting bait to bring out the bastards who torched</p><p>Night Watch.\u201d</p><p>Jana\u2019s lips parted. Then she smiled, a sad twist of her lips. Her dimple didn\u2019t appear. \u201cIs that all I am?\u201d</p><p>A police cruiser raced to the scene with its sirens wailing. An unmarked SUV flew up behind it.</p><p>A woman jumped out of the SUV, her hair flying. At the sight of the gun in her hand, Zane tensed. Hell, here we go again.</p><p>Tony scrambled from the back of the SUV, running up to the woman\u2019s side. Good, at least one guy with sense was with the cops.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Zane said, raising his voice so they could all hear him clearly, \u201cwe can\u2014\u201d</p><p>The woman fired her weapon and shot Jana in the chest.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Jana fell back, and Zane lunged for her, catching her just before she hit the ground. Her eyes were open, stunned, and the red was already bleeding out from her gaze.</p><p>She shuddered in his arms, and her eyelids began to close. The heat began to lessen behind him as the flames died.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d The world seemed to explode around him. Or maybe he exploded. The beast he\u2019d tried to keep in check roared-a loud, enraged cry of fury that burst from Zane\u2019s lips. A cry that was her name.</p><p>The scene shifted around him as the colors faded away until everything was gray. No black and white. No good or evil. Just pain and fury.</p><p>\u201cZane ... don\u2019t-don\u2019t let her ...\u201d The barest whisper of Jana\u2019s voice. So soft. \u201cTake ... m-me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dead, demon,\u201d the woman\u2019s voice rang out as she stepped closer. \u201cJust drugged.\u201d</p><p>His hold on Jana tightened. He rose, cradling her in his arms. Her head fell back against his shoulder.</p><p>The blonde gave him a steely smile. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want the same shot, put her down and step away.\u201d Her gun aimed at him.</p><p>Zane got ready to blast the bitch.</p><p>Then Tony stepped to her side. \u201cHe\u2019s not a threat.\u201d His eyes were on Zane, but the words were directed at the woman.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Zane Wynter, the man known to have been keeping close company with Ms. Carter for the last few days. And he\u2019s a person of interest in the Night Watch fire.\u201d She paused, her eyes narrowing. \u201cHe\u2019s also the man who escaped from your custody, so excuse me if I don\u2019t believe a damn word you say, Captain.\u201d Her gun was still pointed at Zane.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a hunter with Night Watch! He\u2019s not a criminal!\u201d Tony argued.</p><p>Screw this. Zane lunged down the steps with Jana tight in his arms. Hold on, baby. Where the hell was Jude? They needed to get out of there. There were more sirens, and that meant more cops would be coming any second.</p><p>But would those cops be backup for Tony or for the blonde?</p><p>\u201cI told you to put her down!\u201d the woman yelled and her gun jerked. \u201cI said\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tony snatched the gun from her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not shooting at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to get your ass thrown off the police force!\u201d She shoved past him. \u201cPut her down!\u201d She yanked a wallet out of her pocket and held it up in the air. \u201cI\u2019m with the FBI. I\u2019m Special Agent Kelly Thomas.\u201d</p><p>Big fucking deal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a sniper on you right now,\u201d she continued, voice flat. \u201cThe same sniper that took down your shifter friend.\u201d</p><p>Now that made him freeze. He turned his stare on her and met her pale, glittering green eyes.</p><p>\u201cJana Carter is a killer,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to fight for her.\u201d</p><p>More SUVs and cop cars swarmed the scene.</p><p>\u201cLady,\u201d Tony snapped, \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re dealing with here. Let them go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m dealing with.\u201d The wind tossed her hair. \u201cI\u2019m staring at a demon and an Ignitor.\u201d</p><p>Zane dropped his glamour. \u201cNo, Special Agent ...\u201d Jana barely seemed to be breathing in his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re staring at one very pissed demon.\u201d Where was the sniper? Was the claim about him bullshit?</p><p>She marched closer. Tony followed her, keeping his hold on the gun he\u2019d taken from her. Her smile was brittle. \u201cJana Carter\u2019s on the extermination list.\u201d</p><p>Zane stiffened. He\u2019d heard about the list. Heard rumors for years that the FBI was monitoring the most dangerous of the paranormals and putting them on their extermination list. But ... Jana?</p><p>\u201cDo you know how many people she\u2019s killed?\u201d the special agent asked.</p><p>Jana didn\u2019t look like a killer then. She looked weak and pale. Vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cGive her to me,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cAnd you can walk away. I\u2019ll clear up the situation with Night Watch. Clear you with my supervisors, and you can go back to doing your job-a job that\u2019s just like mine.\u201d She exhaled and her gaze dropped to Jana. Her stare hardened as she said, \u201cTracking and killing the monsters out there.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s gaze drifted to Tony. Other cops were there now, standing back, but with their weapons up. If there was a sniper waiting, would he shoot to kill? Or was the plan to drug him, like they\u2019d already drugged Jana?</p><p>Kelly raised her hand and motioned with her fingers. Two men hurried forward. \u201cTake her,\u201d she told them. \u201cLoad her into the SUV and make sure she\u2019s secured.\u201d</p><p>Tony stared back at Zane. Waited.</p><p>\u201cGive her to us,\u201d Kelly said, \u201cand you\u2019re clear. You know what she\u2019s done. You hunted her because of it. Now you\u2019ve done your job. You can get your bounty, get the cops off your back, and walk away.\u201d</p><p>She made it all sound nice and easy. But ... \u201cYou\u2019ll kill her.\u201d He caught sight of Jude\u2019s truck.</p><p>Her lips thinned. \u201cShe\u2019s on the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck your list.\u201d He\u2019d made his choice. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting her.\u201d Zane let his power out. For the first time since he was sixteen years old, he willingly let the demon part of his nature take control.</p><p>A blast of power launched, rolling like a wave, and every human around him hit the ground. They fell, bodies sagging, immediately unconscious as they slammed into the earth.</p><p>He hurried past the bodies. He rushed to Jude\u2019s truck. The shifter was there, but slumped over the steering wheel. Those bastards had shot him. Hell. Zane shoved Jude over and climbed inside, carefully placing Jana on the seat between him and Jude. His fingers brushed over her cheek, then his hand clenched into a fist. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His gaze swept the area, lingering a moment on the special agent.

Five had been her highest demon bag.</p><p>\u201cI thought we were killing him?\u201d</p><p>She yanked out her phone. \u201cThe plan\u2019s just changed.\u201d Oh, it had changed all right. She had a level eight-or higher- demon in her lap, and she knew the guy\u2019s weakness. Too perfect.</p><p>Why, that demon would be even more useful than the Ignitor. Not that the bitch was proving to be particularly useful but ...</p> <p>But she was some fine bait.</p><p>\u201cI want that demon.\u201d She spoke into the phone, knowing other eyes were out there, watching the demon race away with her prey. \u201cFollow him. Hunt him down.\u201d</p><p>Zane Wynter was a hunter, just like she was. He hunted monsters, too. But the difference between them ... he was a monster. She was just a human who had to clean up the mess the beasts made. She\u2019d been cleaning up their messes for years. So tired of cleaning up their shit.</p><p>\u201cIf we can, take them both.\u201d Because her Ignitor was so useful, and she did prefer to work with humans. \u201cIf the woman starts the flames again\u201d-because she knew a taunt when she saw one\u2014\u201cshoot her-shoot to kill.\u201d Sometimes, you had to cut your losses. \u201cHe\u2019ll be more valuable to us.\u201d The things she could get that demon to do....</p><p>He already hunted his own kind. She knew the stories about him. So what she had in mind for him wouldn\u2019t be too different.</p><p>Killing demons. Killing vamps. Killing shifters. Killing all the sick paranormals who made the world into a nightmare.</p> <p>At first, Project Perseus had tried fighting them with human weapons. Guns. Bombs. Then they\u2019d stepped up the game-and started using chameleons. Humans with enhanced genetics, the chameleons were perfect at sneaking up on the paranormals. They could drop their heart rates, slow their breathing, and ambush even shifters. The chameleons had taken out so many monsters. So many ...</p><p>But the real way to win the battle might just be by using one of the Other\u2019s own. A demon half-breed to deal death.</p><p>She smiled as she gazed through the binoculars. Perfect.</p><p>Carefully, she stepped over the sniper\u2019s still body. He was human, which was unfortunate, because she\u2019d had to kill him. But, really, if he\u2019d taken the shot, she wouldn\u2019t have learned anything.</p><p>Now, she knew everything she needed to know. New prey. Prey with a weakness.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Jude came awake in a rush, jerking upright with his claws out and up-just the way Zane expected him to wake.</p><p>Zane grunted and kept the gas pedal pinned to the floor. \u201cWanna tell me how you got taken out?\u201d Jude exhaled hard, and his head wrenched toward Zane. \u201cTaken out?\u201d The words were a little raspy. They wouldn\u2019t be that way for long. Shifters, especially rare, white tiger shifters like Jude, were fast healers. That healing ability was why the tiger had only been out ten minutes.</p><p>\u201cI found you unconscious in the truck.\u201d Jana lay slumped between them. No telling how long she\u2019d be out. \u201cWay to watch my back, tiger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d From the corner of his eye, Zane saw Jude run a shaking hand through his hair. Then his hand dropped to his neck. \u201cDrugged.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. And if the sniper had been out there, why hadn\u2019t he taken a shot at Zane? His psychic blast wouldn\u2019t have been strong enough to carry more than a block. The sniper could have taken him.</p><p>\u201cWho did it?\u201d Jude demanded, and he finally seemed to see Jana. \u201cAw, hell, her, too?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s jaw clenched. After a moment, he said, \u201cShe was shot right in front of me.\u201d He hadn\u2019t expected the special agent to take that shot. If her gun had been loaded with real bullets ...</p><p>Darkness rose around him and the truck began to tremble.</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman claiming to be from the FBI was there.\u201d He forced his hands to ease their too-tight grip on the steering wheel. He sucked in a couple of deep, slow breaths. Control. Jana was going to be all right. \u201cA Special Agent Kelly Thomas. She said Jana was on their extermination list.\u201d</p><p>Jude froze. Yeah, they all knew about the list. They\u2019d even been hired a few times to make sure the exterminations were carried out for particularly dangerous paranormals.</p><p>But ... Jana.</p><p>Zane yanked the wheel to the left. \u201cShe wanted me to just hand Jana over, knowing they were gonna kill her. Agent Thomas wanted ...\u201d He braked hard and turned to meet Jude\u2019s bright stare. \u201cI\u2019m not turning Jana over to the Bureau.\u201d</p><p>Jude whistled. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is it standard procedure for the FBI to drug hunters? Huh? When? They drugged you, Jude. Attacked first, and didn\u2019t plan to ask questions later.\u201d</p><p>The tiger shifter\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cI\u2019m pissed as hell about that\u2014\u201d And his fangs were still out. Those claws still ready. \u201cBut Jana\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the agent wanted Jana dead, she could have killed her.\u201d While I just stood there. Fucking stood there. \u201cBut she drugged her. She didn\u2019t shoot to kill.\u201d Because the agent wanted Jana for something. To use her? Aim and fire-everyone knew that was the way to use an Ignitor.</p><p>His gaze returned to Jana. She still barely appeared to be breathing. Her face was so pale, and dark smudges lined her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not turning her over,\u201d he said again. \u201cShe didn\u2019t burn Night Watch. And before anyone plans her extermination, I want to know exactly what happened with those humans in New Orleans.\u201d He wanted to know everything. Every detail of her life. How had she become a killer?</p><p>How had he?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lettin\u2019 this get personal,\u201d Jude warned.</p><p>Yeah, he was. \u201cGet out of the truck, Jude.\u201d</p><p>The shifter blinked. \u201cIt\u2019s my truck.\u201d</p><p>Zane brushed back the dark hair that had fallen over Jana\u2019s cheek. \u201cI need the wheels because I\u2019ve got to get cover and figure out what\u2019s going on.\u201d His eyes once again met Jude\u2019s. \u201cThe FBI is gonna be looking for me now, too. I don\u2019t want them to come after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew them.\u201d Said instantly. \u201cThe day I\u2019m worried about some jerk-offs in suits ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Erin?\u201d</p><p>At the mention of his lover\u2019s name, Jude blinked. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d A distinct edge had entered his voice.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the ADA. How would she feel about you being on the run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErin trusts me.\u201d Absolute certainty.</p><p>\u201cBut she doesn\u2019t need to get pulled into this.\u201d He still wasn\u2019t even entirely sure what this was. \u201cAnd neither do you.\u201d Zane sighed. \u201cThis is gonna get bad, real bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason you need me.\u201d Jude\u2019s smile showed off his sharp teeth. \u201cI know how to do bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d The shifter didn\u2019t really know just how powerful he was. He\u2019d worked hard to keep Jude and the others in the dark. Sometimes, you didn\u2019t want the whole world to fear you-and sometimes, you did. \u201cI need you to work with Tony. Find out if that special agent is legit. Use Pak\u2019s contacts at the Bureau, and then call me.\u201d He still had the replacement phone Jude had given him.</p><p>The shifter measured him with a long, hard look. \u201cIs she worth being hunted?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never been hunted. Always predator. Never prey.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blow your life for a good fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of the truck, Jude.\u201d There was no more time to waste, and he really didn\u2019t want to punch out his friend.</p><p>Growling, Jude got out of the truck. \u201cDon\u2019t trust her, you hear me? She\u2019s dangerous. The woman could fry you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that. \u201cNo, she couldn\u2019t.\u201d He was probably the only one she couldn\u2019t burn. She could let her fire rage, and it wouldn\u2019t so much as blister his skin.</p><p>Jude slammed the door. \u201cWatch my truck, okay? Watch\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zane left him, racing the truck forward and speeding down the road. After he found a place to lay low, he needed to make Jana tell him the truth.</p><p>Don\u2019t trust her. Maybe though, just maybe, he could make her trust him. If he did, then he could get to Project Perseus- and give the assholes some serious payback.</p><p>But she\u2019d have to trust him first. Have to think that she could rely on him for everything. Anything.</p><p>One killer, trusting another. Right. Fate would laugh her ass off at that one.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, Jana became aware of two things. One ... she was in a bed. A strange, lumpy bed that smelled of stale cigarettes. Two ... she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Since the last thing she remembered was standing in front of Dusk and getting shot-that bitch was so gonna pay for that-Jana didn\u2019t move immediately. She kept her breathing nice and easy, even though her heart galloped in her chest. Slowly, she let the charge build within her body. Her gaze stayed on the peeling ceiling above her, on those faint brown water lines.</p><p>If the Bureau had taken her in for extermination, they\u2019d find out that she wasn\u2019t that easy to kill, and if they didn\u2019t want to kill her ...</p><p>I\u2019m not going to be their pit bull. She was sick of being a weapon to the world.</p><p>The energy built inside her. More, more. The blast would come hot and strong and\u2014</p><p>\u201cTurn it off.\u201d</p><p>The words were clipped, cold, but the voice\u2014familiar. Zane. She rolled onto her side and blinked in shock. He\u2019d been beside her at Dusk. Standing right there when the agent fired. \u201cThey got you, too.\u201d But why? Zane was a hunter, not\u2014</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t get me.\u201d His chest was bare, and his dark hair was mussed, as if he\u2019d been running his fingers through the mane.</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cI don\u2019t ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know you were on the extermination list?\u201d</p><p>No sense lying. \u201cWell, Night Watch was after me, so I figured the FBI was, too. Hell, I figured the FBI was probably the one who was paying your fees.\u201d So why was she there?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any lies,\u201d he told her.</p><p>But she was good at lying.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you in Dusk?\u201d</p><p>Jana blinked. Okay, she hadn\u2019t been expecting that question. \u201cWhy were you there?\u201d Convenient, too convenient, and- Jana jerked up, sending the covers sliding off her body.</p><p>\u201cYou followed me.\u201d Understanding was bitter as her memory flooded totally back.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. \u201cDid you really think the sex would distract me so much that you could just walk away?\u201d</p><p>She took the slap and realized that Zane had taken off her shirt and her pants. \u201cWhere are my clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a technique you use a lot?\u201d Icy words. \u201cYou seduce your way out of trouble?\u201d</p><p>Jana swallowed. \u201cI didn\u2019t have sex with you as part of some master scheme.\u201d She jumped from the bed and started searching the motel room. The obviously cheap motel room. She\u2019d spent her share of nights in plenty of rooms just like this one.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you?\u201d Nearly a growl as some heat broke through the ice.</p><p>She found her pants and turned back to face him. \u201cBecause I wanted you.\u201d For once, she\u2019d just taken what she wanted. She\u2019d known it wouldn\u2019t last. \u201cI knew we didn\u2019t have any future.\u201d Future-what was that? \u201cI wanted you, wanted pleasure-so I took both.\u201d</p><p>His green eyes glittered. \u201cHow many men have heard that line?\u201d</p><p>She threw her pants at him.</p><p>The guy moved then-fast. He lunged across the room. His hands locked around her upper arms, and he yanked her close. \u201cI didn\u2019t turn you over, Jana. The FBI wanted you. They just wanted me to walk away, but I didn\u2019t turn you over. \u201c</p><p>She stared up at him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a fucking idiot.\u201d His breath expelled in a rush. \u201cBecause when that woman fired on you, I was ready to rip her apart.\u201d His head lowered toward hers. \u201cBecause when you fell, I lost control.\u201d</p><p>A demon losing control? Never a good\u2014</p><p>\u201cBecause once wasn\u2019t enough for me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart slammed into her ribs.</p><p>\u201cI want you, I want the pleasure, and I\u2019m damn well not done with you yet.\u201d</p><p>Not done with her? Yeah, that was classy. That was- \u201cYou want me,\u201d Zane said. Yeah, she\u2019d just said as much. \u201cI\u2019m fucking on fire for you.\u201d Jana knew a few things about fire.</p><p>\u201cIf this isn\u2019t what you want, then say no, and say it fast.\u201d His hold gentled. Stroked instead of captured. \u201cBut I\u2019ve spent the last five hours watching you, worrying that you wouldn\u2019t wake up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d had that particular drug of choice fired on her. Humans woke up with no ill effects. Shifters had a bitch of a headache and demons\u2014don\u2019t want to go there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting away from me,\u201d he said, \u201cnot until I know what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Right then ... \u201cI don\u2019t want to go anywhere.\u201d And when she wanted to leave, she would. The demon wouldn\u2019t stop her. No one would stop her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kissed her. She expected a hard kiss, a blaze of passion and anger and fire.</p><p>Instead, she got ... gentleness.</p><p>Jana tensed and her hands lifted. Her nails dug into his arms. No, no, that wasn\u2019t\u2014</p> <p>His lips caressed hers. Softly. So soft, and his tongue whispered into her mouth.</p><p>She used her hold and tried to pull him closer. She didn\u2019t want soft. She didn\u2019t want slow. She wanted\u2014</p><p>Zane\u2019s head lifted. He stared down at her, his eyes darkening. \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna be fast this time.\u201d The words sounded like a threat. He picked her up and held her easily in his arms. Control. He had it in spades at that moment. She could feel his strength, reined in, all around her.</p><p>Zane carried her back to the bed and lowered her onto the mattress. His hands skated down her body and caught the edge of her panties. \u201cNot fast...\u201d he rasped again, and slid her panties down her legs.</p><p>His fingers were rough, with calluses on his hands, but his touch was easy as he stroked her skin.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so damn beautiful,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p>\u201cI think we need to pick up where we left off.\u201d His jaw tightened. \u201cBefore you ran out on me.\u201d</p><p>Hit. \u201cYou don\u2019t want the problems I have to knock at your door.\u201d His hands were movng up the inside of her thighs and talking was a bit hard right then. \u201cYou don\u2019t ... ah, I\u2019m just a bounty, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fuck my bounties.\u201d</p><p>But he was about to fuck her.</p> <p>\u201cYou stopped being a bounty the minute the cuffs hit the floor.\u201d He eased her thighs apart and opened her wide to his gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I?\u201d Because she needed to know. Not a freak, not a weapon, not\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe woman I want.\u201d His fingers touched the folds of her sex. \u201cAnd right now, you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>He was hers. Right then, hers.</p><p>Zane shifted his body, and his breath blew over her exposed sex, sending a shiver through her. \u201cLet\u2019s see just how hot you burn,\u201d he said.</p><p>Zane put his mouth on her.</p><p>Jana nearly jerked off the bed. \u201cZane!\u201d</p><p>His lips feathered over her sex. Then she felt the wet lick of his tongue, a slow swipe right over the center of her need.</p> <p>Her heels dug into the bed and her hands grabbed onto his shoulders. Not to push him away-oh, no-to jerk him closer.</p><p>His fingers brushed against her, then one long finger pushed inside her straining core. In, out, that finger plunged in maddeningly gentle thrusts. Not enough. And his mouth kept caressing, that tongue stroking, and Zane tried to drive her out of her mind.</p><p>Her nails bit into him.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby. I\u2019m going to enjoy you.\u201d No, he was going to make her crazy. His finger pulled out of her. Her body tensed. No, she wanted\u2014</p><p>His tongue pushed into her sex just as his thumb pressed against her clit. Jana\u2019s breath choked out and her body went bow tight.</p><p>He growled against her, the vibration shaking through her sensitive flesh and that tongue-the demon knew how to use his tongue.</p><p>She arched her hips against him. Wanting more, needing ...</p><p>His mouth left her. \u201cOpen your eyes, Jana.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelashes flew open, and she found his black stare trained on her. The lamp on the nightstand threw weak light on the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not coming, not yet.\u201d</p><p>Oh, but she\u2019d been close. She wet her lips. \u201cThis some kind of ... torture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Pleasure. Only pleasure.\u201d His gaze was heavy lidded. \u201cYou said you wanted pleasure, remember?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d also said she wanted him. \u201cTake off your jeans.\u201d She wanted them flesh to flesh.</p><p>He yanked his wallet out of a back pocket.</p><p>What\u2014</p><p>And he pulled out a condom.</p><p>He\u2019d planned his seduction. Why did that make her hesitate? So he\u2019d known they\u2019d sleep together again. Big deal, right? She\u2019d wanted to sleep with him.</p><p>\u201cDoubting, baby?\u201d His fingers went to the buckle of his jeans.</p><p>She shook her head, refusing to admit the doubt, even to herself. Her fingers slid between them, and she took the condom from him. \u201cMy turn.\u201d Because she didn\u2019t like that fine edge of control he held.</p><p>Jana wanted to see the control shatter. No, she wanted him to shatter right before her eyes.</p><p>He unzipped his jeans with a slow hiss of sound. She reached for his cock and found it thick, hard, and swollen with need. She stroked him once with her left hand, a long, slow pump from root to tip. Because she could play the game slowly, too.</p><p>She stared into his eyes. So dark, her demon\u2019s eyes. But fire could burn in the dark. She\u2019d seen it happen plenty of times. \u201cDo I get a taste?\u201d she asked.</p><p>A muscle flexed along his jaw and he eased away, sliding back onto the bed. She rose, following him, and stretched her body so that when he lay back, she was over him, right over that cock that reached for her.</p><p>His flesh was warm beneath her hand, heated with his need and lust. When she touched the tip of his erection, a drop of moisture appeared. My taste. Jana leaned forward and licked that drop, tasting the wild blend of man and sex. Her tongue licked over the head of his cock, then slid just under that broad tip.</p><p>His hips jerked, just a bit.</p><p>Control.</p><p>The demon had it tonight.</p><p>She opened her mouth. Jana let her breath blow on his flesh, then she took his cock inside, parting her lips around him. She sucked his flesh, moving her head in an easy rhythm, but then going faster, taking more as his taste filled her mouth. Wanting more, wanting\u2014</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he rasped and she found herself on her back again, with him over her. Jana blinked, not even remembering how she\u2019d moved. Her hands were on either side of her head, and her legs were spread open. He rolled the condom over his cock and pushed his shaft against her.</p><p>His fingers eased beneath her back, and he unsnapped her bra. When the material fell away, he took her left breast into his mouth. Sucking. Licking. Letting her feel the light score of his teeth.</p><p>She twisted beneath him as the ache between her thighs made her shudder. This wasn\u2019t her style. Fast, hard, she needed\u2014</p><p>His cock slipped inside her. One inch. Two. Her sex clamped around him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so slick. ...\u201d His head lifted. \u201cAnd fucking tight.\u201d Another inch.</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d she whispered, demanded. \u201cI want\u2014\u201d</p><p>He drove balls-deep into her. Jana came at once, a hot blast of pleasure that fired through every cell in her body. She arched beneath him as a moan broke from her lips. Zane started to thrust, fast and deep-thank you, finally!-and the orgasm spiraled longer, wilder, hotter.</p><p>His cock stretched her, filled her sex to bursting, and the deep thrusts slid his shaft right over her clit.</p><p>Aftershocks of pleasure hummed through her body. Her eyes were open, on Zane, locked on the darkness of his stare. Brutal lines of lust etched his face, but he kept his hold easy, and he kept driving into her with those long, hard thrusts.</p><p>The second orgasm rocked through her.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d His control broke. He slammed into her, plunging again and again, and the scent of sex filled the air.</p><p>He froze, then a long shudder worked his body. The darkness of his eyes heated, and Zane called her name.</p><p>Jana wrapped her arms around him, held him tight, and realized she\u2019d never felt better.</p><p>Never felt better ... and never been in more danger. Because if the demon holding her so tenderly, kissing her shoulder so sweetly-if he found out about all the things she\u2019d done in New Orleans, he\u2019d be the one handing her over to the FBI and putting her up for extermination.</p><p>Dawn was coming. Jana lay in bed, her demon\u2019s arms around her, and watched the trickling rays of light break through the blinds. She hadn\u2019t slept after the sex. Neither had Zane. Guess he\u2019d learned from his mistake before.</p><p>They\u2019d lain in bed. He\u2019d held her. It had felt ... nice.</p><p>Weak. You\u2019re letting yourself get weak with him.</p><p>She cleared her throat and forced herself to speak. \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d She glanced at him and found his gaze already on her. \u201cYou\u2019re not going on the run with me.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not running.\u201d</p><p>Her breath expelled. \u201cWell, since I\u2019m not planning on dying, I don\u2019t see a lot of choices here.\u201d Not like she could just stay there and wait for the FBI to come and pick her up. Not ready to die, thank you.</p><p>His fingers feathered down her arm. \u201cThere are always choices.\u201d</p><p>Easy for him to say. He hadn\u2019t spent five years locked up in hell. She\u2019d gotten out at eighteen, but then she\u2019d just traded one prison for another.</p><p>\u201cI need to know ...\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cI need to know about the people you\u2019ve killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She tugged away from him and rose from the bed.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re not the cold-blooded killer you pretend to be.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pressed together. Not that he could see the tremble anyway. She had her back to him. \u201cWow, aren\u2019t you the sweet-talker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about the first fire.\u201d</p><p>Screams. Pain. Flames that burned so fast. \u201cThey say you never forget your first,\u201d she murmured. She\u2019d tried, but had never forgotten the sound of Greg\u2019s screams ... or the smell of his burning flesh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard there\u2019s no control with an Ignitor\u2019s first fire.\u201d</p><p>She jerked on her panties and heaved up her jeans. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard right.\u201d A bitter laugh slipped from her lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what was happening.\u201d Jana hooked her bra and tugged on her shirt. \u201cI was so scared. My skin felt like it was on fire.\u201d Her hand dropped to her stomach and pressed hard. \u201cMy gut was churning. I thought I\u2019d explode.\u201d</p><p>And she had.</p><p>No, he had.</p><p>Jana turned back to face Zane. She lifted her chin. He had sat up in bed, and the covers pooled around his waist. \u201cI thought I was normal. Just like everybody else, and then the fire came.\u201d She shook her head, remembering the taste of fear. It tasted a lot like ash.</p><p>\u201cAn Ignitor\u2019s power hits at puberty.\u201d</p><p>The man sounded so damn clinical, but he was right. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s usually spurred on by an extreme emotional upset,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Give the guy a freaking cookie. So he\u2019d done his homework on Ignitors.</p><p>I killed the last Ignitor who crossed my path.</p><p>He climbed out of bed. Naked, strong. He grabbed his pair of jeans and pulled them on, then he stalked toward her. \u201cWere you upset, Jana? When that first fire broke free, were you angry?\u201d</p><p>Her back teeth clenched. \u201cYes,\u201d she gritted out. She\u2019d been angry and so scared. Because her mother had been gone. She\u2019d been in that house, just her and\u2014</p><p>\u201cYour stepfather died in that fire.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cDid you want him to die or did the fire get out of control? It would have been so easy to burn out of control....\u201d</p><p>Jana laughed. Zane didn\u2019t get it. Was he really trying to give her a way out? \u201cI wanted the bastard to die. I stared at him, and I thought, over and over, that I wanted him to die.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cAnd then flames raced across his skin and he started screaming for me to help him.\u201d Bitch, fucking help me! Help me!</p><p>Zane stared down at her, and his gaze seemed too intense.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let him touch me.\u201d Her voice sounded hollow. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let him punch me again, and I told him\u2014\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI told him if he tried to hit me once more, I\u2019d kill him.\u201d So many bruises. So many broken bones. Her mother had always been there with excuses when anyone asked what happened. She fell down the stairs. Jana\u2019s a clumsy girl. You\u2019d think a thirteen-year-old would know how to ride a bike better, wouldn\u2019t you?</p><p>Her fingers brushed across her jaw. It had been wired shut for weeks after the fire. \u201cI warned him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was his fault,\u201d she\u2019d told herself this over and over, \u201cthat he didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips parted. \u201cJana ...\u201d</p><p>Her hand flew up and hung in the air between them. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Anger fired the word. But he shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your pity.\u201d She knew pity when she heard it. \u201cI\u2019m not some damaged kid who needs you to hold her and make everything better.\u201d Not anymore, dammit.</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg Burgess deserved what he got.\u201d Because if she hadn\u2019t killed him, he would have killed her, and she knew it. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the fire, and afterwards, hell, no one believed me. They thought I\u2019d set everything up ... staged the scene and lured him to his death.\u201d Bastards. The DA had said her jaw had been broken from the force of the blast. He\u2019d said she was too close when she ignited the accelerants and that she\u2019d been thrown across the room.</p><p>What accelerants? She\u2019d burned Greg with her power.</p><p>But Greg, the bastard, had always kept plenty of booze around. And they\u2019d been in the garage when the fire started. With the oil and gas and ...</p><p>You\u2019re lying, girl. You set the fire. You burned that man alive. The DA\u2019s voice was so clear in her mind, even after all these years. Did he beg you for help?</p><p>Yes, he had.</p><p>\u201cYou were protecting yourself.\u201d Zane\u2019s voice was a low rumble and she glanced back at him. His hands were clenched into powerful fists, and the faint lines near his eyes looked deeper than before.</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d she said, and it was true. Greg\u2019s ghost didn\u2019t haunt her anymore. Jana took a long, deep breath, and then she let her lips curl. Because she wasn\u2019t a victim, and Zane needed to see that. She wasn\u2019t some damsel he needed to rescue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She could rescue herself. In the fairy tales, she wasn\u2019t the trapped princess. She was the fire-breathing dragon, and she\u2019d burn anyone who got in her way. She had.</p><p>\u201cI killed to protect myself then.\u201d True. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a scared girl anymore.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s head tilted a bit to the right as he studied her. \u201cSo the others you\u2019ve killed? Were you protecting yourself then?\u201d</p> <p>The rush of anger broke through her control. Did she need to give him a whole damn life story? Did she have to justify every move? \u201cYou want to compare kills? Your hands have blood on them, too, Zane!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never claimed they didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be one of the good guys, but you\u2019ve crossed the line for duty, I know you\u2014\u201d His laughter stopped her cold.</p><p>Jana blinked. \u201cAm I missing a joke?\u201d The guy had a real piss-poor sense of humor. Good in bed, lousy humor-noted.</p><p>The laughter faded, but his lips maintained that slight twist of amusement. \u201cAh, Jana...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI have to know ... What in the hell ever made you think I was one of the good guys?\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 9</p><p>A good guy? Oh, the woman had it wrong. Very, very wrong. When he\u2019d listened to her story about her dick of a stepfather, the last thing he\u2019d felt was good. If he\u2019d known Jana back then ... I would have gotten rid of the bastard for you.</p><p>Now he understood so much more about her, and Zane realized ... he and Jana were a lot alike. Maybe too much.</p><p>So young when we first killed. So much power.</p><p>Jana shook her head and stared up at him a bit blankly, all that wild, dark hair loose around her face. \u201cYou are a good guy, Zane. You-you work for Night Watch. You\u2019re a hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean a licensed killer.\u201d He shrugged and tried to keep his voice careless. Real hard when the woman was making him care more than any other had. \u201cThey pay me to hunt, but even if they didn\u2019t, do you really think I\u2019d be doing anything else? Some of us were born to hunt. To kill.\u201d He paused deliberately. \u201cBut you know that better than anyone else, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>That pink tongue swiped out again and his cock hardened. Down, boy. Not now. He hadn\u2019t meant to give in to the lust before. Wrong place, wrong time. But he\u2019d watched her while she\u2019d been out, he\u2019d-dammit, worried-and when she\u2019d woken, he\u2019d wanted.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t used to not taking what he wanted. So he\u2019d taken her.</p><p>And had one hell of a fine time. But I still want more. With her, I always want more.</p><p>What was he going to do about that problem?</p><p>A veil seemed to fall over her face. \u201cHow\u2019d you get us away from the Feds?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. I-I remember being in front of Dusk.\u201d Her forehead wrinkled. \u201cI remember\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you go there?\u201d he interrupted, inching closer to her. He had the feeling the woman might break and run at any moment, and that wasn\u2019t an option. She wasn\u2019t going to leave him.</p> <p>She blinked.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you go back to Dusk?\u201d That point had been bothering him. \u201cDid you have a contact there?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes-such a deep blue-widened. \u201cGuess you could say that.\u201d Her shoulders rolled. \u201cThe bastards from Perseus came after us too fast. I knew someone at Dusk must\u2019ve tipped them off about us. Demons aren\u2019t exactly trustworthy.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the jibe.</p><p>\u201cSo I figured if I shook some cages\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean started some fires.\u201d</p><p>\u201c-that I\u2019d get somebody to talk.\u201d She frowned at him. \u201cAnd I did. A demon named Morris. The bastard with the scar who turned tail and ran when the fight got hot.\u201d</p><p>Excitement had his heart pounding faster. \u201cHe gave you a contact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I got him to call his contact. I told \u2018em if they wanted me, they could find me at the burning den.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. The fire was your beacon?\u201d Not real subtle, but then, she wasn\u2019t exactly a subtle kind of woman.</p><p>She smiled at him. And it was ... a real smile. Warm. Her dimple winked, and he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cNo, Zane,\u201d she said, \u201cthe fire was for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She could always surprise him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like the way the demons ganged up on you. I wanted to send a message, and I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you fighting my battles.\u201d He could handle any demon, any day of the week. But ... she\u2019d gone back to avenge him? That was ... sweet, in a Jana way. Maybe some girlfriends would cook a guy dinner.</p><p>Jana cooked his enemies.</p><p>Wait-girlfriend? What the hell am I thinking?</p><p>Her hand lifted and slid over the stubble on his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>Her hand dropped. \u201cI was waiting for those bastards from Perseus to show up, but the FBI got there first.\u201d Her lips tightened. \u201cActually, you got there first.\u201d She waited a beat then said, \u201cBait, huh?\u201d She didn\u2019t seem angry. Just curious.</p><p>Bait. He didn\u2019t like the sound of that.</p><p>\u201cGuess you realized there were bigger fish than me out there, right? What, does Night Watch have a hard-on for Perseus now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d And a hell of a lot more. \u201cWe lost five agents in that fire. We don\u2019t take kindly to losing our own.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze searched his. \u201cWhat are you going to do? Do you really think you can take Perseus down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby, I do. And you\u2019re gonna help me blow the bastards to hell.\u201d</p><p>He ditched the truck. Jude would want to rip him apart when he found out, but Zane had to abandon the shifter\u2019s ride. Someone would have seen it at Dusk, and there was no point in continuing to advertise their presence.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t hard to find another vehicle. It wasn\u2019t legal, either. But he\u2019d learned long ago that you sometimes had to go outside the law in order to get a job done.</p><p>\u201cThe Feds and the cops are going to be looking for us,\u201d Jana said, turning to glance at him. They were in an older model Ford. Nothing flashy, nothing fancy. The kind of car you forgot two minutes after you saw it. He\u2019d switched tags twice, just as a precaution.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not going to find us.\u201d They had about thirty more minutes to go before they made it to New Orleans, and Zane damn sure wasn\u2019t planning to stop for highway patrol.</p><p>\u201cThe FBI will have splashed our pictures all over the news. Every cop in the area probably has our descriptions.\u201d Her voice was flat. Just stating the facts.</p><p>\u201cBaby, every cop in the area got your description days ago. Hell, those in New Orleans had it years ago, and you\u2019re still not inside of a jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good at hiding.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d figured that.</p><p>\u201cAnd when I was working for Project Perseus, they made sure the cops stayed off my back.\u201d</p><p>The car almost swerved off the road. \u201cYou worked for them?\u201d What the hell?</p><p>\u201cIt was either go after their kills or find my ass inside of the jail you just mentioned.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her from the corner of his eye. Her attention seemed to be on the blur of pine trees.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go back to jail,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Then why did you kill?</p><p>Her head turned toward him. \u201cThings aren\u2019t black and white.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they are for you.\u201d A mocking laugh. \u201cNot for me. They\u2019ve never been that way for me. So when Perseus told me that I\u2019d be doing the world a favor, that I\u2019d be taking out monsters who hurt women and children, hell, yeah, I was tempted.\u201d</p><p>Her nails scored across the seat, and the grinding noise seemed too loud in the car. \u201cThey gave me dossiers. Told me when and where to strike, and they paid me well. I\u2019d never had much, but suddenly, I had a chance for everything. And all I had to do was light a few fires.\u201d</p><p>Zane realized he was hitting ninety, and he forced his foot to ease off the gas pedal. \u201cThe ones you went after ... were they killers?\u201d She\u2019d taken out vamps in Baton Rouge. Vamps were known to be\u2014</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d She paused. \u201cWill you think better of me if I say that everyone I killed while working for Perseus was evil? That they were all murderers who needed to be put down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they killers?\u201d he asked again, refusing to let her rile the beast.</p><p>\u201cSome were. At first, they all were.\u201d She blew out a breath. \u201cBut then Perseus started thinking there wasn\u2019t any such beast as a good supernatural. Hell, to them, the only good supernatural was a dead supernatural. Vamps, shifters-they needed to be put down. All of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a supernatural.\u201d Was that why they were trying to put her down, too? His gaze darted to the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a human first. A human with a psychic skill... that means I\u2019m a tool for them. Not good enough to ever invite over for dinner, but good enough to use. They like to use enhanced humans-Ignitors, charmers-my handler told me that sometimes monsters had to kill monsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour handler?\u201d Now they were getting someplace.</p><p>And that black SUV that had been following them for the last ten minutes was getting closer. He could see the other vehicle so well in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cMy handler was a real sweetheart named Beth Parker. Human to the core, and a woman who got off on death more than anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Disgust tinged her words. \u201cShe didn\u2019t take so kindly to me wanting to leave the fold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I made sure I gave her one hell of a kiss good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was with those asshole scientists who held me at the end in New Orleans. Since I didn\u2019t want to play ball with them anymore, they decided to cage me. Then when they couldn\u2019t change my mind ... they decided I was expendable.\u201d</p><p>The SUV was getting closer. He started edging back up to ninety.</p><p>\u201cThey strapped me to a table and got ready to cut into my head. They thought the secret to the fire was in my brain. That something was wired differently. And that bitch Beth just stood there, watching, while I screamed.\u201d</p><p>His own fury rose.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t attacked a human since my stepfather. I\u2019d said I never would again. ...\u201d Her words trailed off. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t dying on that table for them. Beth made it out of the flames, but she got the kiss of fire on her hand and face. She won\u2019t ever forget me. I made sure of it.\u201d</p><p>Well, damn. \u201cYou play hard, don\u2019t you, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t play.\u201d</p><p>The odometer trembled up to ninety-five, but that SUV was still gaining.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t play, either, Zane, and they sure as hell aren\u2019t going to be opening the door and offering a welcome smile to us when we get there.\u201d</p><p>But the men who\u2019d slammed into them with the big rig had wanted her alive. And the cop had wanted her alive, too.</p><p>It was fine to kill me, but they want her breathing.</p><p>That didn\u2019t really make sense if they were just planning to kill her later on.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about opening the door,\u201d he said, \u201cI can manage that just fine\u2014\u201d</p><p>The SUV rammed into their bumper and the Ford lurched forward. The minivan in the right lane let out a long, desperate honk.</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d</p><p>He held tight to the wheel and floored the Ford. Unfortunately, flooring it meant that it only went about ten miles per hour faster.</p><p>The SUV hit them again.</p><p>Jana jerked around and stared behind them. Her breath rasped out. \u201cThey\u2019re already found us.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure they\u2019d ever lost them. The minivan plowed into Jana\u2019s side and she screamed. What? The minivan? He hadn\u2019t seen that one coming.</p><p>The minivan hit again. Metal groaned as the door caved in. \u201cJana!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. He risked a fast glance at her. Her hair was a dark shield around her head and\u2014</p><p>And the front of the minivan burst into flames. The vehicle swerved and plowed into the trees.</p><p>That\u2019s my girl.</p><p>But before he could speak, the SUV took aim at them once more. Another hard hit from behind made his teeth rattle. \u201cShit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of them.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he knew she could. But they were about to head into more traffic and if the fire got out of control ... Jana unsnapped her seat belt. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiming.\u201d</p><p>She crawled into the backseat. Her ass brushed his shoulder. Aw, damn.</p><p>He glanced in the mirror.</p><p>Smoke rose from the hood of the other vehicle. The driver of that SUV must\u2019ve gotten the message that she was sending because the brakes squealed as the SUV shuddered to a stop.</p><p>Zane got them the hell out of there. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d But she didn\u2019t sound fine.</p><p>He adjusted the rearview mirror and saw her slump in the backseat. \u201cBut if it\u2019s all the same to you,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m staying back here.\u201d Her lips curved in a tired smile. \u201cAnd that, lover, was our welcome wagon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour police captain is collaborating with the perpetrators,\u201d Kelly Thomas charged, pointing her finger at Antonio. \u201cNot only did the bastard let them escape his custody once, he did it twice!\u201d</p><p>Harold Evans, the chief of police, lowered his bushy brows and stared at Antonio. \u201cThat true, son?\u201d His hard Southern accent rolled on the words.</p><p>Antonio narrowed his eyes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the only one at that club. She\u201d-the agent who was seriously pissing him off- \u201cwas right there.

Gray stubble coated his sagging chin.</p><p>\u201cZane Wynter, the hunter from Night Watch,\u201d Antonio reminded him, though he knew the reminder wasn\u2019t necessary.

Antonio sure hadn\u2019t seen that move coming. But then, Zane had surprised him a few times before, too.</p><p>\u201cYou took my weapon,\u201d Kelly snapped. \u201cIf you\u2019d just stood the fuck down, I would\u2019ve had Jana Carter in custody.\u201d</p> <p>The small office seemed too hot. He could feel the heavy weight of Harold\u2019s stare.</p><p>\u201cYou knew my gun didn\u2019t have bullets in it, Captain. Just enough drugs to put them both down.\u201d Her breath huffed out. \u201cYou knew that.\u201d</p><p>Time to cut the bullshit. Everyone in that office understood the score. \u201cAnd you know what drugs do to demons.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt might not have knocked him out. It could have set him off-it could have made him rabid and the guy could have attacked us all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did attack us!\u201d she threw out.</p><p>\u201cDemon.\u201d Harold grunted, holding up his hands. \u201cThe hunter\u2019s a demon.\u201d He raised one brow. \u201cWhat\u2019s the girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn Ignitor,\u201d Kelly bit out. \u201cAn out-of-control Ignitor who needs to be put down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t putting her down,\u201d the words slipped out instantly. Antonio leveled his stare on the agent. \u201cYou were just knocking her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t get the pleasure of killing her.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that was personal. The job and personal issues didn\u2019t mix. The special agent should\u2019ve recognized that fact long ago.</p><p>Papers rustled as Harold opened the files on his desk. \u201cYou used drugs on her because your boss, Anthony Miller, gave orders that Ms. Carter was to be brought in alive, and deadly force was to be avoided at all costs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. He\u2019s the senior agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his ass is in Miami right now. He doesn\u2019t even understand what\u2019s happening here. He doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Miller.\u201d Harold folded his hands on top of the desk. \u201cHe understands everything.\u201d</p> <p>Her hands fisted at her sides. Her right hand seemed a little too close to her holster. \u201cWynter might have been a good hunter once, but he\u2019s obviously turned, because of her. She has that effect on men. The woman seduces, gets men to trust her, then she betrays them.\u201d Her breath rushed out as she stalked toward Antonio. \u201cYour friend is in over his head. Even a demon can\u2019t control her fire.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose. \u201cNow that would depend on just how strong the demon is.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes couldn\u2019t narrow much more. \u201cWe requested Wynter because he\u2019d handled Ignitors before. He killed the last rogue, I\u2014we-thought he could handle her, too.\u201d</p><p>The picture suddenly became clearer. \u201cYou contracted with Night Watch, and you were hoping the demon would kill your Ignitor, weren\u2019t you? You didn\u2019t want him to apprehend her, you wanted him to execute her.\u201d He stalked closer to her. \u201cYour hands would\u2019ve been clean then, right? You would have done your job and gotten your wish. Jana Carter would be dead.\u201d</p><p>Her smug smile was his answer.</p><p>Hell. \u201cZane Wynter doesn\u2019t kill for sport.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at that. \u201cHe\u2019s a demon. Of course, he does.\u201d</p><p>He was aware of old Harold stiffening and the temperature in the room dropped a good ten degrees. But the special agent didn\u2019t seem to notice that change. \u201cYou think all demons are evil?\u201d he asked her, just to be sure he understood.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re demons, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh ... you know it\u2019s biological, right? It\u2019s not like they\u2019re the devil\u2019s minions, they\u2019re just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupposed to be descended from the Fallen. Right. Whatever. They\u2019re not human. I\u2019ve stared into their eyes. Their real eyes, and I know they\u2019re evil. Just as evil as she is.\u201d</p><p>Antonio could only shake his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of faith in people, do you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Right.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Jana do to piss you off so much?\u201d \u201cYou mean, other than go on a burning and killing spree for her entire life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, other than that.\u201d He felt Harold\u2019s eyes on him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard enough.\u201d Harold\u2019s bearlike growl filled the room as he shoved to his feet. \u201cSpecial Agent, you need to go check in with your boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck in with your senior officer.\u201d His right hand held a fountain pen in its white-knuckled grip. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s got word on your would-be prisoners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She jerked her thumb toward Antonio. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about Antonio. I\u2019ll handle my man.\u201d \u201cSee that you do.\u201d One hard nod, then she whirled on her heel, and stormed for the door. Of course, the woman didn\u2019t open the door and softly shut it behind her. No, she slammed the damn thing hard enough to make the framed commendations on Harold\u2019s wall shake.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I much like Special Agent Thomas,\u201d Harold said, and Antonio glanced at him just in time to see the chief of police drop the glamour from his eyes.</p><p>Demon black eyes stared back at him. Antonio had always carried his suspicions about the chief, but ...</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not all fucking monsters. The special agent and those dicks at the FBI with their extermination list-they need to realize that.\u201d</p><p>Antonio exhaled. \u201cAm I suspended?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d That pen stabbed toward him. \u201cWhat you are is on your way to New Orleans. I got a report that Wynter was headed that way with the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t have jurisdiction\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew jurisdiction. I\u2019m not letting Agent Thomas get her hands on Wynter first. He\u2019s a hunter, but he\u2019s also one of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your ass down there. Find Wynter and find that girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter? What do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s come to my attention that she may know certain ... pertinent facts ... about a group the FBI has been trying to infiltrate for years. A group that is quite dangerous.\u201d He paused. \u201cTo folks like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Jana Carter has got the info I need, I do not, do not, want her winding up in Special Agent Thomas\u2019s hands first. I want her, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, then, son, because if you want that promotion that you been chomping at the bit for, bring \u2018em both back. Alive.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, that last part might not be so easy. Especially since he was a cop who happened to be one-hundred-percent human ... stepping into a world that wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Good thing he knew exactly where to go for some paranormal backup.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we going into a hospital?\u201d Zane asked, shaking his head. \u201cWe need to get to Perseus before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the way to get to Perseus.\u201d Jana stared at the swirling ambulance lights. Our Sisters of Mercy Hospital was booming tonight. She and Zane had gotten into New Orleans earlier, then laid low until the sun dropped.</p><p>As soon as the night fell, they\u2019d been ready to hunt, and the hunt, well, it began here.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a nurse inside. Her name\u2019s Nancy Gilbert.\u201d Low on the Perseus totem pole, but she was still a way to make contact. \u201cShe reports to the group on any ... unusual patients that check in.\u201d Like a twenty-year-old girl who\u2019d escaped a four-alarm fire without any burns.</p><p>Stupid. I\u2019d just stared up at the nurse and said, \u201cI did it.\u201d After so many folks not believing her, she\u2019d sure never expected the nurse with the cold gray eyes to believe her.</p><p>Or to pump her full of drugs and have her taken from the hospital.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get you in there, and we need you to fake an injury.\u201d Her gaze darted over him. \u201cOr maybe we should give you a real one.\u201d</p><p>He held up his hands. \u201cThanks, baby, but I\u2019m fine with a fake injury.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cWill this woman recognize you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The last time she\u2019d seen Nurse Nancy, Jana had been sporting short, streaked blond hair, darkly tanned flesh, and she\u2019d been five years younger.</p><p>Now that she\u2019d gone back to her dark hair and her skin hadn\u2019t seen the sunlight in months, she doubted Nancy would recognize her. Nancy had only been with her a few hours that fateful night, anyway.</p><p>Not that Jana had ever forgotten her. You didn\u2019t forget the woman who changed your life. Payback.</p><p>\u201cSo how do we get from point A to point fucking Perseus?\u201d Zane demanded.</p><p>She grabbed his hand. Now or never. \u201cLeave that to me.\u201d If he wanted to walk into hell, she\u2019d take him and maybe, just maybe they could bring down the devil together.</p><p>Then I\u2019ll be free.</p><p>If only.</p><p>Running hadn\u2019t worked-they\u2019d just come after her. They\u2019d keep coming, until the Perseus group was stopped. Zane was strong; she knew he was high on the demon scale. Would he be strong enough to stop the bastards? I hope so.</p><p>She and Zane hurried forward, and as soon as Jana caught sight of two EMTs returning to their ambulance, she let out a high, desperate scream. \u201cHelp me!\u201d She shoved against Zane, sending him stumbling. \u201cMy brother-he\u2019s\u2014\u201d She whispered to him, \u201cHit the ground.\u201d</p><p>Zane collapsed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s having a seizure again! Oh, God, he\u2019s been having them almost constantly, and I don\u2019t have his meds, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>The EMTs-a man and a woman-rushed over to them. Jana held onto Zane\u2019s hand, clinging tightly and, because she was one fine actress, she let the tears track down her cheeks as the EMTs loaded Zane onto a stretcher and rushed him inside the hospital.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of medication is your brother taking?\u201d one of the EMTs demanded.</p><p>\u201cUh ... uh ... rufinaide.\u201d</p><p>The EMT blinked and squinted at her.</p><p>What? That was a seizure medication, wasn\u2019t it? Just then, Zane moaned and his head sagged against the stretcher.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d she whispered, letting her own head drop forward. From the corner of her eye, she saw a familiar figure bustling over to them. Nurse Nancy always liked to take a look at every new arrival. After all, that was her job.</p><p>Jana had been back a few times over the years, back to take a look at the nurse. You screwed me over, Nancy.</p><p>When paranormals were sick or injured, usually it was harder for them to mask exactly who-what-they were. Nancy counted on that. She preyed on their weakness. Everyone at Perseus did.</p><p>The EMT said, \u201cWe need to get him stable and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d the nurse asked.</p><p>Jana squeezed Zane\u2019s hand. Hard.</p><p>His eyes fluttered open, and in that instant, she caught his demon-black stare.</p><p>Nurse Nancy sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>A blink from Zane and his eyes were back to green. \u201cWh-what happened?\u201d His head turned slowly, and he focused on Jana. \u201cDid I ... Shit, the hospital.\u201d</p><p>He shoved up, but the EMTs grabbed his arms and tried to hold him down.</p><p>\u201cEasy, sir, you\u2019ve had a seizure. You need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck what I need.\u201d He broke their hold in an instant and surged to his feet. He wavered for a moment, and his body shuddered.</p><p>Okay, so the guy was a pretty good actor, too. She\u2019d need to remember that.</p><p>He caught her arm and hauled her close. \u201cYou know better than to bring me here,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou know ...\u201d</p><p>Nurse Nancy stepped in front of them. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk with you a moment, sir.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and, keeping his hold on Jana, skirted around the nurse.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let him leave!\u201d the male EMT called out. \u201cHe might have another\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know why your medicine isn\u2019t working,\u201d Nurse Nancy said calmly.</p><p>Of course, she knew. Meds never worked the way they were supposed to work on demons.</p><p>Zane froze. Then he tossed a hard glare back over his shoulder. \u201cOh, you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm ...\u201d The nurse didn\u2019t wear one of those annoying white uniforms. She wore dark blue scrubs, and a stethoscope dangled around her scrawny neck. \u201cCome with me into the back. Let me check you out thoroughly, and I can explain everything.\u201d</p><p>Right. Step into my web. Nancy was a pretty woman, with gray-streaked black hair and the faintest of lines around her eyes. She didn\u2019t look like the devil. Really, she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Zane glanced back at Jana. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She stared into his eyes. \u201cWe need help. Let\u2019s see what she has to say.\u201d</p><p>He gave a curt nod. Together, they turned to follow Nancy. But the nurse held up one hand, stopping her. \u201cI\u2019d like to speak to him privately.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not going to happen. \u201cI\u2019m his sister. I go where he goes.\u201d</p><p>Nancy\u2019s lips tightened.</p><p>\u201cShe goes,\u201d Zane snapped.</p> <p>\u201cFine. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>And they marched right past the EMTs. Poor EMTS, they were still blinking and trying to figure out what was going on.</p><p>\u201cIn here.\u201d Nancy pointed to a small examining room. \u201cJust sit down. I\u2019ll be ... right back.\u201d</p><p>They went inside. Nancy closed the door behind them and sealed them inside.</p><p>Zane frowned.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone to make the call.\u201d Ah, but she\u2019d watched this routine a few times. Not that Nancy knew that. \u201cShe\u2019s letting her contact know that she has a potential in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA potential? Is that what I am?\u201d He yanked his phone out of his front pocket and tapped fast on the screen. He put the phone to his ear and a few seconds later said, \u201cPak. Yeah, I\u2019m in New Orleans.\u201d A brief hesitation, then he said, \u201cI need you to run a check on a nurse Nancy Gilbert at Our Sisters of Mercy Hospital. She\u2019s about five-foot-four, forty-five to fifty years old and\u2014\u201d</p><p>His gaze flew toward the door. He shoved the phone back into his pocket.</p><p>Nancy opened the door about three seconds later. She had a bright, friendly smile on her face. \u201cSorry, I just needed to assure the EMTs that you were in capable hands.\u201d She laughed, a light tinkle of sound. \u201cYou\u2019d think I\u2019d never treated a patient before!\u201d</p><p>Jana inched closer to Zane\u2019s side. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the meds working?\u201d She really didn\u2019t want to bullshit through the chitchat. Might as well get to the main show.</p><p>The door clicked closed. Nancy\u2019s smile dimmed. \u201cFirst... I\u2019m going to need some background information on my patient.\u201d</p> <p>Zane narrowed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour parents ... what are their names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I need to see if you have a family history of\u2014\u201d \u201cFuck, she doesn\u2019t know.\u201d Zane charged forward. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Nancy put a hand on his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re a demon.\u201d Zane stiffened.</p><p>Nancy\u2019s gaze darted to Jana. \u201cThe question I have ... are you a full-blood or a hybrid?\u201d She blinked and seemed to realize they might not know what she meant. \u201cAh ... a hybrid would be a mix, a\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zane backed away from her touch, and Jana saw the muscle flex in his jaw. \u201cI know the damn term. Yeah, my mother was human but that bastard who fathered me wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Oh, nice touch. Perseus would be all over a hybrid. They\u2019d want to recruit him, not kill him. They did love that human blood. And the powers that be over there would really get off on a demon killing other demons.</p> <p>\u201cDemons don\u2019t always respond the way they\u2019re supposed to when they are given human medications,\u201d Nancy said, her voice quiet and calm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHybrid,\u201d she murmured and her gaze darted to Jana. \u201cAnd you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m human. I\u2019m his half-sister.\u201d Said fast because she knew Nancy would be able to rustle up a demon who could check her out. A demon could look right through the veil of glamour and see another of his kind. If one took a good look at her ... no sense pushing that. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Jana knew exactly what the nurse meant. Nancy wasn\u2019t interested in her.</p><p>\u201cI have some friends.\u201d Nancy turned her attention back to Zane. \u201cThey work with people like you. They can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. No one can help me. I\u2019ve been trying for years, fighting this thing inside\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nancy\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDoes it tempt you, this beast inside?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cDoes it call to you ... taunt you with the power that it has?\u201d</p><p>Jana didn\u2019t roll her eyes, but it was a near thing.</p><p>\u201cI know I can do any damn thing I want,\u201d Zane\u2019s voice rumbled, so dark, and Jana\u2019s gaze darted to him. \u201cIf I let my control go, there\u2019s no stopping me.\u201d</p><p>Now that sounded so real. Maybe too real. Her tongue snaked over her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever let go?\u201d Nancy\u2019s eyes were fixed on him.</p><p>A grim nod. \u201cOnce.\u201d</p><p>Nancy leaned forward. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Eagerness glittered in her gaze. Hungry vulture.</p><p>Zane straightened his shoulders. \u201cI killed the bastard who claimed to be my father. I sent the demon back to hell.\u201d</p><p>Well, damn. The man really was one class-A actor, and a pretty good writer, too, because that was just the kind of story Perseus would eat up.</p><p>Demon killer... destroying even your father because of what he was.</p><p>Nancy smiled. \u201cGood for you,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes, there are some folks that just need to be put down.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes. But those folks weren\u2019t always demons. Humans could be just as evil.</p><p>Nancy\u2019s gaze darted to Jana.</p><p>Jana swiped her hand over her cheeks, wiping away the tear drops that she still let fall. \u201cIt\u2019s been so hard,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Nancy gave her an understanding smile, one oozing fake sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m sure it has. But everything will be changing for you now.\u201d She turned toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Zane asked, taking a step forward.</p><p>\u201cI need to call a friend. He can come and get you. He\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re safe for the night.\u201d</p><p>Safe and snug inside Perseus. Just what Zane wanted. Hmmm ... maybe they would be opening those doors wide open ... making them welcoming for him. The guy had just played Nancy perfectly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be coming with him,\u201d Nancy said, that stare once more landing on Jana\u2019s face. \u201cYou understand, don\u2019t you? Your brother needs to be around others who understand him.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, this wasn\u2019t part of the plan. Jana blinked and lifted her chin. \u201cI understand him just fine.\u201d</p><p>What? Was that pity filling Nancy\u2019s eyes? The last thing she wanted was for that witch to pity her. \u201cYour brother is special,\u201d Nancy said. \u201cMy friends can help him, but if you come-you\u2019ll just be in the way. They don\u2019t have a place for someone like you.\u201d</p><p>Because Nancy thought she was simply another human, one without special skills. If she\u2019d been a paranormal, Nancy would be getting ready to send her off-either to use her or to kill her. But a straight human got a pass out of there.</p><p>Only she didn\u2019t want that pass this time. She wanted to stay by Zane\u2019s side. The guy might need her. No, he would need her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d Zane said, interrupting her. He turned his head and his eyes met hers. \u201cGo home and wait for me. I want- I want to see what these people have to say. If they can help me ...\u201d</p><p>Now he was kicking her to the curb, too.</p><p>But, wait, wasn\u2019t that supposed to be what she\u2019d wanted? She\u2019d been trying to get away from him since the beginning, but now ... Now she didn\u2019t want to let him out of her sight. She didn\u2019t trust Nancy. Didn\u2019t trust anyone in Perseus. What if Zane wasn\u2019t strong enough to bring them down?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d Her fingers caught his and held tight. \u201cWe\u2019re a team, remember?\u201d He\u2019d been watching her back. She\u2019d watch his.</p><p>He glanced down at their fingers. Then slowly, carefully, he pulled away from her. \u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>Shit. The demon was cutting her loose.</p><p>This had not been part of the plan. They really should have talked more before storming into the hospital. Maybe agreed to, oh, she didn\u2019t know\u2014not desert each other.</p><p>Nancy opened the door, and the woman had a near-smirk on her face. \u201cYour brother will be fine. Trust me, he\u2019s in good hands.\u201d</p><p>The hell he was. But the demon was the one calling the shots and if he wanted to go solo, if he wanted to risk his sexy neck, then who was she to make the idiot see reason?</p><p>She rose onto her toes and brushed her lips against his cheek. \u201cWatch yourself,\u201d she whispered. Then she pulled away. Her steps were slow as she made her way to the door. \u201cYou\u2019ll... take care of him?\u201d she asked Nancy, casting one last look back at Zane.</p><p>\u201cYou have my word,\u201d the nurse assured her. Right. The woman\u2019s word? That wasn\u2019t worth the breath it took to speak.</p><p>Jana slipped into the white-tiled hallway. Her shoes squeaked on the floor. She could see her image staring back up at her from that gleaming tile.</p><p>Run... make a break for it. The demon had told her to go. She could wash her hands of him and break free now. Maybe he\u2019d succeed and take down Perseus. Then she\u2019d just have the FBI jerks on her trail, but she could shake them, no problem. Especially now that she knew they had such a hard-on for her. She\u2019d be hyper-aware of them, and they would not catch her again.</p><p>Yeah, she could run now. Run, and never look back. Maybe she\u2019d even head to Mexico. Get some sun.</p><p>It was the smart thing to do.</p><p>He told me to leave.</p><p>The exit doors waited for her. A few more steps, and they swished open silently, giving her easy access to the night. Run.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t perfect. Far from it and, in that instant, she was tempted. After all, she\u2019d run plenty of times in her life. An EMT bumped into her, his shoulder clipping her arm. Running was easy.</p><p>She took three steps back. The doors slid closed before her. The demon had saved her twice now. She\u2019d always thought it was important to pay your debts.</p><p>Besides ... she really owed the folks at Perseus an ass-kicking.</p><p>Don\u2019t worry, Zane. I\u2019ve got your back.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>They blindfolded him and, because Zane was playing the game, he let them do it. Nancy crawled into the car with him and sat to his right. He could smell her-the antiseptic scent of the hospital, stale cigarettes, and vanilla body lotion.</p><p>A man drove him. The same guy who had smiled apologetically and said he\u2019d need to blindfold him. The guy barely looked older than eighteen, and he had sun-streaked blond hair, a little too long, and blue eyes.</p><p>The car snaked through the city. Turning left, right. At first, Zane tried to keep track of the turns, but the kid was fast. The car\u2019s engine growled as he sped through New Orleans, taking them deeper into the heart of the Big Easy.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you know what you were?\u201d the kid asked, and the kid, he was a demon. Zane had caught a glimpse of his eyes, too. Before he blindfolded me.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was sixteen.\u201d Zane figured keeping as close as he could to the real truth about his past was the easiest way to go. Less chance of screwing things up that way. That was why he\u2019d given Florence Nightingale the real deal about his past.</p><p>\u201cI always knew,\u201d the kid said. The car slowed, then stopped. Probably at a red light. \u201cMy dad never let me forget, not even for a moment, that I was different. He loved telling me how I was just like her.\u201d</p><p>Behind the blindfold, Zane blinked. \u201cYour mom was a demon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmm...\u201d The car picked up speed again. \u201cShe seduced my dad, then dropped me off and cut out of town. She left us both.\u201d Bitterness. Pain.</p><p>Zane eased out a slow breath. \u201cMaybe you were better off without her.\u201d</p><p>The kid didn\u2019t speak and Zane didn\u2019t know what the hell else he was supposed to say.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you kill your father?\u201d Nancy asked and the question fired right at his gut.</p><p>Can\u2019t forget about her. \u201cBecause he deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you kill him?\u201d</p><p>The truth. \u201cWhen I was sixteen years old.\u201d</p><p>The silence in the car grew thicker then. Darker. He could feel the tension, so thick it bore down on him like a lead weight until not-so-sweet Nancy said, \u201cGood for you.\u201d</p><p>The car braked again, but it wasn\u2019t a slow stop. The demon up front killed the engine. \u201cWelcome home,\u201d the guy said.</p><p>Home? Not likely. More like welcome to hell.</p><p>If she wasn\u2019t so good at hotwiring cars, Jana would have been shit out of luck. But if her correctional time had done anything for her, well, it had introduced her to a new group of friends.</p><p>Some of those friends had come from homes that were too much like her own. Homes where the mothers or fathers liked to use fists every night on their kids. Or they liked to touch ... when and where they shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Once she\u2019d gotten out of juvie, she\u2019d made sure she helped her friends. Nothing lethal. They\u2019d just wanted to send some messages. They hadn\u2019t believed that she could start the fire with her mind. No, they\u2019d just thought she was one world-class pyro, and they\u2019d wanted her to use her skills to keep their monsters away.</p><p>Monsters. Sometimes, you just couldn\u2019t escape them.</p><p>So she\u2019d done her part. She\u2019d watched out for them. When Lillie McGill-her \u201croommate\u201d from juvie-had gotten out and headed home, Jana had tailed her. The first time Lillie\u2019s father had come at Lillie with his fists, Jana used the fire to write STOP on the wall next to him.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t killed him. Hadn\u2019t even touched him with her flames. Her fiery message had been enough to send the guy scrambling to church and to rehab.</p><p>No, she hadn\u2019t needed to let the flames lick his skin. Besides, back then, she\u2019d been too scared to kill again.</p><p>Not that the fear had lasted long. Not once Perseus got ahold of her.</p><p>Lillie\u2019s father found Jesus, though he didn\u2019t realize the devil had been the one to send the message. He\u2019d never touched his girl again, and Lillie had made sure that Jana had a first-class education on boosting cars.</p><p>Fair trade. Sure seemed like that now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jana kept the PT Cruiser in sight as it weaved through the streets. Since she\u2019d been gone, Perseus had changed their location. They did that as part of their protection strategy. They changed locations every few months. Tricky bastards.</p><p>She kept a few cars between her and the other car. Not so many that she would lose sight of the Cruiser, and not too few because she didn\u2019t want the folks in the Cruiser to see her.</p><p>They swept past the St. Louis cemetery and the white tombstones rose up past the wrought-iron fence, ghostly markers to map the trail to Perseus.</p> <p>Her fingers tightened on the wheel as a shiver skated down her spine. She\u2019d never been too fond of the cemeteries in New Orleans. Because she knew, unlike most of the tourists, that some of the dead could really come out and take a bite out of their unsuspecting prey. And with all those folks out there working their summoning spells-spells they thought were simply harmless games they\u2019d read about in books-well, she knew better. Nothing harmless about them. She\u2019d seen her share of walking nightmares.</p><p>More miles passed. They shot through a neighborhood. Looked so normal. Things always looked normal.</p><p>Then the houses began to disappear. The storm a few years ago had destroyed a lot here, and folks hadn\u2019t rebuilt. Not that she blamed them, not one damn bit.</p><p>Where are we going? The car ate up more road. Some factories dotted the street now. Warehouses.</p><p>Finally, finally, the Cruiser pulled into the lot near a warehouse. Above the wooden doors, two white masks had been painted onto the red wood. One smiling, animated face; the other crying, with a tear drop sliding down the white cheek. Mardi Gras masks.</p> <p>She drove past the building and made sure not to let her car slow for even a second. In her rearview mirror, she saw the driver climb out of the vehicle. Looked like a young guy. Perseus did like to recruit them young.</p><p>The guy glanced up and he stared after her car.</p><p>She didn\u2019t accelerate. Didn\u2019t zoom out of there with a squeal of tires. Jana just kept her speed nice and easy. She took a left at the corner, aware that her heart was slamming into her ribs. She\u2019d find a place to stash the car, then she\u2019d go back for Zane.</p><p>She knew where he was now. Knew exactly where Perseus was.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>Guess who is coming home? Time to raise a little hell.</p> <p>They took his blindfold off the minute the heavy metal doors swung shut behind him. Zane blinked, and his eyes adjusted almost immediately to the darkness. Handy little demon side effect. The darkness never hindered his vision.</p><p>Monsters surrounded him. Dragons with fire shooting from their mouths. Horned bulls the size of buses. An angry Poseidon sprang forth from the sea, with his trident up and ready to attack.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a float graveyard,\u201d the kid said, shrugging. \u201cOnce the parades are over, you got to find some place to store \u2018em.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced over at Nancy. Her hands were twisted in front of her. \u201cI\u2019m going to be leaving you soon.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d make a point of seeing her again.</p><p>\u201cDavey can take you in the back. He\u2019ll introduce you to the folks who can help you.\u201d Her breath heaved out on a sigh. \u201cThis is going to be good for you.\u201d Her face and voice seemed so sincere. \u201cThis will be a whole new world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on it.\u201d</p><p>She offered him a trembling smile, then her head inclined toward the kid. \u201cOkay, Davey. You take him back there, then you can come and drive me to the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Now that was odd. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with us?\u201d</p><p>Fear flashed in her eyes, just for a moment. \u201cI-I need some air.\u201d</p><p>Right. There was plenty of air to breathe right there. She turned away.</p><p>Davey waited with his brows up. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>Hell, yes. Zane rolled his shoulders. He marched behind Davey, weaving through the floats. Dark, massive shadows hung in the air.</p><p>He heard the metal door open behind him, a loud screech of sound. Nancy-going to get her air? Davey stopped and turned back to face him. The guy pointed to another door on the left, a wooden one this time. \u201cThis is it.\u201d</p><p>Fucking finally.</p><p>\u201cGlad you\u2019re here, man.\u201d Davey flashed a tired, lopsided smile. \u201cYou\u2019re ... you\u2019re like me. Good to know I\u2019m not the only one.\u201d</p><p>The only demon? Not even close.</p><p>\u201cMy old man said I was evil.\u201d Davey\u2019s chin lifted. \u201cI\u2019m not. We\u2019re not. We couldn\u2019t help the way we were born.\u201d No, they couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna change the world,\u201d Davey said with a quick nod. \u201cMake it so much better.\u201d</p><p>Was that really what Perseus was telling its recruits? Because how did killing good people at Night Watch make the world better?</p><p>Davey pushed open the door, and Zane got ready to kick ass.</p><p>Getting inside the warehouse was easy. Too easy. Jana found a broken window on the left-hand side of the building and slipped right inside.</p><p>Then she hesitated because really that should have been harder. Especially if this was the new base camp for Perseus. It should have been ...</p><p>\u201cI was wondering how long it would take you to show up.\u201d</p><p>Lights flashed on, a blinding explosion of illumination that lit up the warehouse. At the same instant, Nurse Nancy jumped from behind some boxes and grabbed Jana\u2019s arm.</p><p>Jana charged up, ready to burn\u2014</p><p>The nurse slammed a needle into her arm. \u201cDidn\u2019t really think I\u2019d forget you, did you, Jana?\u201d The smile on her face chilled Jana\u2019s blood.</p><p>Jana wrenched back, but she could already feel the drug sliding through her veins. \u201cHow did\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never forget a face.\u201d Footsteps pounded as others jumped from the shadows. \u201cAnd certainly not yours. Guess you could say it\u2019s burned into my memory.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d burn her all right. Jana stumbled and slid to her knees. Charge, come on, charge. She shoved the darkness back and demanded, \u201cWhere\u2019s ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother?\u201d A laugh. Nancy had the syringe gripped tightly in her hand. \u201cOr rather, the hunter Zane?\u201d</p><p>Played.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve got him just where we want him to be.\u201d</p><p>Trap.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Charge. She felt the heat build in her body. Build...</p><p>And fire shot across the warehouse, seeming to burst from the giant green dragon\u2019s mouth and lunge toward Poseidon.</p><p>Come on, come on. She didn\u2019t have much left in her, but she wasn\u2019t going down without a fight. The fire snaked forward and raced toward the two assholes in black who were lifting their guns toward her. Oh, no, they should know better, they should\u2014</p><p>Water burst from the sprinklers overhead. Heavy, gushing waves of water that banked her fire even as she tried to stir it again.</p><p>\u201cWe planned for your arrival,\u201d Nancy murmured.</p><p>Another guy in black-freaking guards, she\u2019d never forgotten them-ran toward her through the smoke. Her body slumped as the drug spread through her blood. Can\u2019t be happening.</p><p>Shit, sometimes it just didn\u2019t pay to try and do the right thing. Next time, she was running and looking out just for number one.</p><p>Next time.</p><p>Jana sucked in a deep breath of air. One more charge. The asshole was closing in on her with his gun clutched in his fist.</p><p>The guy slammed the butt of his weapon against the side of her head. Right before her cheek hit the cement, she felt the fire escape, and she heard him scream.</p><p>When he heard the scream, Zane leapt to his feet. Good old Davey had dumped him in some kind of holding room- looked for all the world like an interrogation room at the Baton Rouge PD, complete with what Zane knew to be a two-way mirror-and he\u2019d been biting back his rage and trying to keep his control.</p><p>Then he heard the scream. Zane ran for the door. He grabbed the handle and jerked-locked. Right, like that was gonna stop him. He jerked again, using some of the enhanced strength he usually kept carefully banked. The lock shattered and the door flew toward him.</p><p>He raced in the direction of that fading scream. His nose twitched. What the hell? Was that\u2014</p><p>Smoke.</p><p>Jana. Had she come after him?</p><p>Davey jumped in front of him. \u201cWow! Man, wait, what are you doin'?\u201d</p><p>He shoved past Davey. \u201cSomeone screamed.\u201d</p><p>Davey grabbed his jacket. \u201cThe guards will handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere weren\u2019t any fucking guards there when we came in.\u201d If there had been, he would have noticed them, he would have\u2014</p><p>Davey laughed. \u201cSure there were, man. They\u2019re chameleons, though. You don\u2019t see them unless they want to be seen. You\u2019re gonna find lots of strange folks here.\u201d</p><p>Chameleons. Human chameleons. He\u2019d heard about them. They could blend in with almost any background, could lower their heartbeats and respiration so much that they were often undetected, even by nearby shifters. Unless the atmosphere got damn hot, you couldn\u2019t make a chameleon come out and play if he didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>Unless it got hot...</p><p>He shook off Davey and rushed for that last door. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Davey yelled. \u201cStay here, they\u2019re watching\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah, he just bet they were. He was at the door. This time, Zane didn\u2019t bother with the lock, he just kicked out and the wood shattered.</p><p>So much for his cover.</p><p>He burst into the cavernous room. Water poured from the ceiling, pooling on the floor and mixing with the smoke. Through the downpour, he saw them. Nurse Nancy, grinning, holding a syringe, and three, no, four assholes in black, all standing in a circle around-around\u2014</p><p>One of the assholes lunged forward and grabbed something. No, someone. He hefted Jana up in front of him and put his gun to her sagging head. \u201cTake another step, demon, just one more ...\u201d The guy\u2019s bulging eyes locked on Zane. The right side of his face was red and blistering. Jana had let him feel her fire before the bastard took her out. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll make sure she never opens her eyes again.\u201d</p><p>He stilled and stared at the man. Long and hard. Marking him. Because he\u2019d already seen the blood trickling down the side of Jana\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The chameleon smiled, the grin pulling at the burnt skin of his face. \u201cNice to know you realize who\u2019s in charge.\u201d</p><p>The fuck he did.</p><p>The sprinklers turned off abruptly and only small drops of water fell onto Zane\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cYou need to come back with me,\u201d said a quiet voice from behind him. Zane glanced over his shoulder. Davey was there, gazing at him with demon black eyes. \u201cNow. \u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d the chameleon with a death wish said, \u201cwe\u2019ll be bringing the fire bitch, too.\u201d His wet hair stuck to his head.</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t think of leaving dear Jana behind,\u201d Nancy added. \u201cNot when she went to so much trouble to come and join our little party.\u201d</p><p>Jana. \u201cYou knew who we were. The minute we walked into the hospital, you knew.\u201d</p><p>She just stared back at him as drops of water slid down her face.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell did you bring me here? So you can try to kill me?\u201d He lifted his chin. \u201cCome try and take your best shot.\u201d If he could distract the chameleons, maybe he would have a chance of getting Jana free.</p><p>But no one took his bait, and Nancy, well, she blinked and looked confused. \u201cWhy would we want to kill you?\u201d She walked toward him. Her eyes were all wide and fakely earnest. \u201cWe want you to join us.\u201d</p><p>And she was bat-shit crazy.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t help us, then we\u2019ll make sure that your lover\u201d-her eyes cut to Jana\u2014\u201cbegs for death.\u201d Wasn\u2019t she Miss Sweet Sunshine.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Davey said again, with steel in his voice. \u201cCome willingly or we\u2019ll drug you, too.\u201d He spun around at that. \u201cThe hell you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Davey lifted a gun. Now where had the kid gotten that? He\u2019d been unarmed before.</p><p>Zane wondered if he could move fast enough. He couldn\u2019t blast the guy. Usually a demon\u2019s power wouldn\u2019t work on another demon, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to take Davey out psychically but\u2014</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try it,\u201d Davey advised. \u201cThis drug\u2019s a new mix. The last demon we shot didn\u2019t survive even an hour before the darkness took him.\u201d</p><p>Zane weighed him. Davey didn\u2019t look quite so clueless and young anymore.</p><p>\u201cWe want you alive, Wynter,\u201d Davey said. \u201cBut if you fight us\u201d-his lips pulled down\u2014\u201cthen you\u2019ll both die.\u201d</p><p>Aw, the guy sounded like he\u2019d regret that. But he\u2019d still kill us.</p><p>Davey held out his hand. \u201cGive me your phone.\u201d</p><p>His phone had a tracker in it from Night Watch. They would have followed him after his last call. They\u2019d already know about this place. Zane pulled out his phone and tossed it to the kid. Davey caught it and instantly smashed the phone in his grip. \u201cNow head to the back. We\u2019ll be going out the southside exit. There\u2019s another car waiting for us.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>Davey lifted one brow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think this was really headquarters, did you? We\u2019re barely above sea level here. Those rooms you saw, that\u2019s all we got here, but the loading area in the back makes for a perfect getaway so no one sees us leave.\u201d The barrel of the gun lowered. \u201cGuess you could say this place is our testing grounds.\u201d</p><p>Bastard. Smart.</p><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d Davey glanced at the chameleons. \u201cAnd, shit, Nancy, do something about that one\u2019s face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe lost him,\u201d Pak said, his voice carrying easily over the phone to Antonio. \u201cHis signal just went dead.\u201d</p><p>Hell. Antonio glanced over at Jude. The tiger shifter had both hands locked on the wheel. \u201cGive me his last location.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA warehouse on Bienville, number 8-1-2.\u201d A pause. \u201cI don\u2019t like this, Tony.\u201d</p><p>Join the club.</p><p>\u201cIf those assholes who torched my building have him ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen they\u2019ve picked the wrong demon to screw with,\u201d Jude said, his shifter hearing easily picking up Pak\u2019s words. \u201cBecause no one messes with Zane and gets away with it.

Seems he was one of the scientists working at Perseus when Jana burned the lab in New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. \u201cWas he undercover?\u201d Because if Jana had killed an FBI agent, the woman was more screwed than he\u2019d thought.</p><p>\u201cThat I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Of course.

Nothing like having an all-powerful vampire on your side when things got bad.</p><p>\u201cI want this group taken down.\u201d Intensity fueled Pak\u2019s words. \u201cWe hunt the ones who are evil, who\u2019ve crossed the line. We don\u2019t destroy the innocent.\u201d</p> <p>Antonio exhaled. They just had to hurry and get to New Orleans. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t let them get you.\u201d</p><p>Zane held Jana during the van ride. He didn\u2019t give the asshole chameleon a choice. When he was close enough, Zane just grabbed her and held her tight.</p><p>The chameleon sneered at him, the right side of his face blistering even more.</p><p>Davey joined them in the back of the van. Three armed chameleons, the nurse, and Davey all sat in the back. What a fun group.</p><p>Jana\u2019s breath rustled against Zane\u2019s throat. She was alive. That was the only reason the chameleons were still living then.</p><p>His gaze tracked back to the burned chameleon. He stared at him, feeling the burn of his rage, and for the first time, Zane let his power surge straight into the mind of a human.</p><p>The chameleon\u2019s face-except for that fiery cheek-went stark white. His eyes bulged even more and his breath wheezed out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d The warning came from Davey. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about killing him.\u201d</p><p>Because he could. It would be so easy. With a stray thought, he could kill the chameleon. He was strong enough. The idiots didn\u2019t understand just who they had in their midst.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want him to die,\u201d Zane murmured. Not yet. \u201cI just want him to suffer.\u201d And he looked deeper into the man\u2019s mind. Jeremy, that was his name.</p><p>A high-level demon could easily manage mind control over a human. Zane had never enjoyed the sport because he\u2019d watched what his father had done with that particular power. Watched his mother be abused and tortured from the inside out.</p><p>He\u2019d never thought he\u2019d force his way inside a human\u2019s mind, but ...</p><p>But the bastard had been ready to pull that trigger. He\u2019d wanted to pull it. Jeremy\u2019s thoughts were right there for him to see and feel. Clear as day. The chameleon hated Jana. He\u2019d wanted to put that bullet in her brain more than he\u2019d wanted his next breath.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like her because you\u2019re afraid of the fire,\u201d Zane whispered to the bastard. \u201cBut you don\u2019t understand. That little kiss she gave you on the cheek is nothing compared to what I can do.\u201d What I\u2019m going to do. He blasted the last thought into Jeremy\u2019s head.</p><p>Blood trickled from Jeremy\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cGet out of his head,\u201d Davey ordered, grabbing Zane\u2019s hand. \u201cGet out or I\u2019m taking her away from you.\u201d Try.</p><p>The van braked. The door at the front squeaked open. Zane held his grip on Jeremy\u2019s mind, just a little bit longer. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like you, kid,\u201d he said to Davey. \u201cHe thinks demons are too high up on the food chain. At the first chance, he\u2019ll stab you in the back or slit your throat.\u201d It was true. Maybe Davey wasn\u2019t strong enough to get inside the chameleon\u2019s mind or maybe he\u2019d just stayed out because they were both supposed to be on the same twisted side, but the chameleon planned to come gunning for Davey.</p><p>For every demon he could find.</p><p>\u201cBastards ... killed my f-family....\u201d More blood leaked from Jeremy\u2019s nose. \u201cD-deserve to ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremy. \u201c Nancy jabbed a needle into his arm. Ah, Nancy and her needles. He\u2019d have to watch out for her. Jeremy shuddered, then slumped to the side. The connection ended in an instant.</p><p>Davey shoved open the back doors of the van. \u201cLet\u2019s take the party inside.\u201d</p><p>Moving carefully, keeping a tight hold on Jana, Zane climbed from the van. One glance and he knew they were outside the city. The swamp. The smell hit him even as the insects chirped, their calls filling the air. The thick, twisting trees of the swamp surrounded them. Two big, metal buildings stretched across the terrain, half hidden by trees and the fog.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d Davey turned and didn\u2019t even glance back to see if Zane followed.</p><p>But with the goon squad behind him, all brandishing their weapons, it wasn\u2019t like he had much of a choice. Well, he did, actually. He just wasn\u2019t taking over this game until he saw all the players up close and real personal. Who waited in those buildings?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll send someone back for Jeremy.\u201d Ah, so Nancy didn\u2019t care about leaving her pit bull behind. Figured.</p><p>Zane tightened his hold on Jana and headed for the first building.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving yourself away, you know.\u201d Davey still wasn\u2019t looking back, and his voice was whisper soft. Just for Zane\u2019s ears. \u201cWhen you show you care about something, someone, it can make you weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not weak.\u201d</p><p>Davey stopped in front of the building. Two guards were there, with guns holstered at their hips. Zane noticed the video cameras then. Set up for surveillance all around the perimeter.</p><p>\u201cThis used to be an army training area. For training Uncle Sam didn\u2019t want the world to know about.\u201d Davey tossed him a cold smile. \u201cPerseus ... inherited the facility when the U.S. government forgot about it.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit.</p><p>They went inside the facility and headed down a long, winding hallway. More cameras. Motion sensors. Figured. Big Brother was definitely watching. After a while, they stopped in front of a shining black door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be given a chance in here.\u201d Davey\u2019s shoulders were tense as he stared at Zane. \u201cI\u2019d advise you not to blow it.\u201d Then he knocked softly on the door.</p><p>A feminine voice told them to \u201cCome in,\u201d and Zane stepped into the spider\u2019s web.</p><p>A blond spider. A pretty spider with dark brown eyes, an elfin face, and a broad smile. A spider who also happened to have raised, red scars on the back of her right hand and the side of her face.</p><p>I burned the bitch.</p><p>So he\u2019d found his prey. \u201cI guess you\u2019re Beth Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Her head inclined toward him. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a hard man to catch, Zane Wynter.\u201d She walked around the desk. Her gaze dipped, just for a moment, to Jana\u2019s still body. \u201cBut I knew with the right bait, we\u2019d be able to lure you in.\u201d</p><p>The right bait was standing in front of him. \u201cLet me guess ... you and your team just got back from Baton Rouge.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAnd we just missed you ... thanks to those idiots with the FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou missed me at Night Watch, too.\u201d Every muscle in his body was tight, but his voice was easy and soft. \u201cBut I think you got a few of my friends.\u201d</p><p>Beth shrugged. \u201cUnfortunate collateral damage.\u201d</p><p>What. The. Fuck.</p><p>\u201cJana was our target, and we had to make certain she wouldn\u2019t find any sympathetic authorities in your area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed five people.\u201d And what was up with that subtle emphasis she\u2019d put on \u201cwas our target\"?</p><p>Beth stared at him. Didn\u2019t blink. Davey shut the door behind them. \u201cThere was ample time for escape. The super-naturals should have moved faster.\u201d She shrugged again, as if to say: Not my fucking fault they didn\u2019t get out.</p><p>\u201cYou know, we could have killed you at the Mardi Gras warehouse.\u201d Her teeth were white and a little sharp for a human\u2019s. Her smile was just cold. \u201cBut we let you live. Do you wonder why?\u201d Her gaze darted to Jana. She sighed a bit, roughly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put her down on the couch? There\u2019s no sense holding\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jana stirred against him, then her body tensed. He glanced down and saw her lashes flutter open. Confusion and a haze of pain cloaked the blue depths. \u201cZane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Beth said clearly, \u201cit\u2019s really not.\u201d</p><p>Jana\u2019s eyes widened in understanding, and she jerked against him, tumbling from his arms. She staggered and managed to land on her feet, but she kept a death grip on his arm. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Jana.\u201d Beth\u2019s smile dimmed a bit. \u201cGlad you finally came home.\u201d</p><p>He felt the fury vibrate through Jana\u2019s body, and he expected fire to erupt in a blaze across the room. Nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cThe drug slows the charge,\u201d Beth said, as if reading his mind. \u201cShe won\u2019t be able to fire up for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to fire up\u2014\u201d Jana lurched forward. \u201cI can still kick your ass!\u201d</p><p>Davey grabbed her, catching both of Jana\u2019s arms, and pinning them behind her back.</p><p>Zane lunged, ready to rip that kid apart.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d Beth held up her hands. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for this to turn violent, not when I want to help you both.\u201d</p><p>Help them?</p><p>Jana stopped fighting against Davey. Her eyes were trained on Beth.</p><p>Beth\u2019s gaze was on Zane. \u201cYou\u2019re something special, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she murmured. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it at first. Didn\u2019t realize ... not until I saw you at Dusk.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell, she knew what he could do.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you on the power scale?\u201d she asked. \u201cNine, a ten?\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t answer, but he decided it was time he let his power out. Time to rip into Beth\u2019s head and tear Perseus apart.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t work.\u201d The faintest of lines appeared around those doll eyes of hers. She tapped her temple with her index finger. \u201cI\u2019ve got a spell in place to keep you out. Once I knew how strong you were, I figured I\u2019d better call out the big guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d Jana\u2019s soft voice. Lost. Confused.</p><p>But he knew she wasn\u2019t lost. The woman was just biding her time as she planned her next move. Damn, he loved that about her. She was a fighter. In a few more seconds, he knew she\u2019d be going after Beth.</p><p>Provided he didn\u2019t beat her to the punch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rare that a hybrid demon has your strength.\u201d Beth studied him like he was some kind of bug. No, an experiment. To her, that\u2019s probably all he was. \u201cYou know that makes you a valuable commodity.\u201d Her head tilted back. The better to watch him. \u201cAnd to think, I originally thought Jana was the prize. I didn\u2019t realize what I\u2019d found in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Is that why you gave your goons the all clear to kill me when they slammed their semi into us that night?\u201d</p><p>The woman didn\u2019t blink. \u201cBack then I thought you were expendable.\u201d</p><p>Great. Expendable.</p><p>\u201cHere at Perseus, we put humans first. Jana\u2019s a human, so she was the priority.\u201d</p><p>There it was again. Only the emphasis wasn\u2019t so subtle on the \u201dwas the priority.\u201d</p><p>Beth sauntered toward him. The woman actually put one of her fire-engine-red nails on his chest. \u201cYou have all of a demon\u2019s strengths, but inside, where it matters, you\u2019re human.\u201d She stared up at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve killed demons before. You killed your own father.\u201d</p><p>He was aware of Jana stiffening in Davey\u2019s hold.</p><p>\u201cYou kill them, you hunt them.\u201d Beth let her hand fall away. \u201cBecause you hate them, don\u2019t you? You want to wipe the bastards off the earth.\u201d</p><p>Well, wasn\u2019t she a warm Christmas card greeting. \u201cI am a demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother was human. That wasn\u2019t some bullshit cover story that you fed Nancy. It was the truth.\u201d</p><p>So she\u2019d done her homework on him. Was he supposed to be impressed?</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d A different note had entered Jana\u2019s voice. One he hadn\u2019t heard before, but he could still identify it. Worry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour father killed her,\u201d Beth said. \u201cHe showed you just what those freak demons are at their core. But you showed him just how strong humans can be. Because it was your human side that fought back.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was too satisfied as she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s your human side that let you walk through the door. We want that human side. We want you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed then. He couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cYou actually think I\u2019m gonna work for Perseus? Lady, you\u2019re out of your mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh, yeah, Zane, she is,\u201d Jana said.</p><p>Beth\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand. You\u2019re a wanted man right now. The FBI is after you, and the Baton Rouge PD thinks you were involved in the arson at Night Watch. They think you\u2019ve been working with your lover, Jana Carter, a known criminal, to set a series of fires in Baton Rouge and New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>She paused and glanced over at Jana. \u201cJust so you know, there was another fire in New Orleans tonight. Witnesses will say they saw you at the bar right before it burned. You and</p><p>Wynter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s their M.O., Zane.\u201d Jana\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cThey make their recruits become the hunted. Make them run out of options.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Beth said this instantly. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make you run out of options\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit, Beth!\u201d Jana fired back. \u201cYou took every one of my options away. You set me up for fires, and you turned me into a wanted woman!\u201d</p><p>Beth inhaled a deep breath. \u201cYou set the first three fires.\u201d One blond brow rose. \u201cYou\u2019re not innocent, Jana. Don\u2019t pretend to be for your new lover.\u201d Then Beth made a mistake. She sauntered too close to Jana.</p><p>Oh, he saw it coming even before Jana shoved back against Davey with her upper body and slammed both feet into Beth\u2019s stomach.</p><p>The blonde doubled over, gagging. Davey swore and hauled Jana back.</p><p>\u201cGet her out!\u201d Beth lifted her head. Her eyes glittered with fury. \u201cPut her in containment.\u201d Her gaze darted to Zane. \u201cPut them both in there. Let them calm the hell down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m plenty calm!\u201d Jana shouted. \u201cCalm enough to kick your ass even without the fire, calm enough to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time I had you on my table, you were begging to live.\u201d Beth\u2019s scarred hand was over her stomach, and her eyes were icy cold. \u201cYou\u2019ll be begging again soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Jana\u2019s chin notched up. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be burning.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s lips trembled, a small move, and he knew that she understood Jana\u2019s words were a promise.</p><p>\u201cCan you still feel the fire on you, Beth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet her out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut!\u201d</p> <p>They were thrown in a meat locker. Well, that\u2019s what it felt like to Zane anyway. A small, tight, metal room, with the temperature set to chill.</p><p>\u201cBastards,\u201d Jana snarled even before Davey swung the door shut. A four-inch-thick steel door. She glanced over her shoulder at Zane. \u201cCan you get us out of here?\u201d</p><p>He let his powers push out, let them ease against the door and he immediately felt the containment field. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a witch here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they have.\u201d She shoved her hair out of her eyes. Her hand shook. \u201cProbably the same witch who\u2019s protecting Beth from you. Did she set up a field around the room?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI can\u2019t get out.\u201d Flat. Well, technically, he could get out, but not without his psychic blast hurting her, maybe killing her, because in order to overcome the spell, he\u2019d have to let his power surge through at full level.</p><p>He walked closer to Jana and skimmed his hand carefully down her bruised cheek. The bruise would be there for days. Humans. It took them so long to heal.</p><p>She flinched at his touch.</p><p>His gaze held hers. \u201cWhy did you follow me?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYou could have run.\u201d</p><p>The blue of her eyes seemed so deep and dark. \u201cAnd left you alone?\u201d Her shoulders dropped a bit. \u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d She brought her body close to his. \u201cYou know they have cameras on us. They\u2019ve got this room wired for sound and video.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see the cameras but he believed her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re watching us. Waiting for us to make a mistake.\u201d Her voice dropped lower. \u201cThey like to use your weakness against you.\u201d</p><p>Davey already thought he knew Zane\u2019s weakness.</p><p>\u201cI came back,\u201d she said, her voice clear and loud. \u201cBecause Perseus ruined my life.\u201d</p><p>True. But ... her eyes said something different. I wasn\u2019t leaving you alone.</p><p>\u201cAre you really a hybrid?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>His back teeth clenched. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jana nodded. \u201cAnd a level ten?\u201d</p><p>That he wouldn\u2019t answer. Not with those cameras on them.</p><p>She leaned up on her toes and pulled his head down toward her. Her lips feathered over his lips as she breathed, \u201cCome in...\u201d</p><p>Wrong time, wrong damn place, but at those words, a hot surge of need fired his blood. Her body was close, pressing so softly against his, and her rich scent was all around him.</p><p>But she\u2019d been hurt. Drugged. And he fucking wasn\u2019t planning on performing for an audience.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she whispered again. \u201cI need you to see ... me. \u201c</p><p>It took a moment for the real meaning of her words to sink in, but then he understood. She wasn\u2019t talking about sex. Not talking about pleasure.</p><p>She knew how strong level-ten demons were, and she was giving him permission to go inside her mind. Come in. Giving him permission to learn her every secret, her every thought.</p><p>I need you to see ... me.</p><p>Jana eased back and stared up at him.</p><p>Come in.</p><p>His power wouldn\u2019t work against the spell locking them in the room, but there was nothing locking him out of her. So Zane took a breath, stared into her eyes, and went in.</p><p>Straight into the fire.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>The fire was all around him, burning so hot and fast. Screams echoed. Screams that came from him-no ...her.</p><p>The fire he saw, the twisting orange and gold flames-it was in Jana\u2019s mind. Her memories.</p><p>Paint peeled off the walls, boiling and dripping even as she screamed for the fire to stop. Screamed and choked on smoke. Screamed for help that didn\u2019t come.</p><p>And the flames wouldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Zane sucked in a deep breath and fought through the memories. Jana\u2019s first fire. He could see the charred body of her stepfather. Hell.</p><p>Another scene flashed in his mind\u2019s eye. Jana hunched over a wooden table as tears trickled down her cheeks. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t mean for it to happen!\u201d</p><p>A balding man in a suit loomed over her. \u201cSo you admit you started the fire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou started the fire. He died.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes squeezed closed. \u201cI want my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo damn bad because she sure as hell doesn\u2019t want you. She knows you\u2019re a killer, and she never wants to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Jana\u2019s fingers trailed up Zane\u2019s chest. He knew she was right in front of him, but the images of the past were all he could see then.</p><p>Jana walked forward, one foot in front of the other. The juvie facility was behind her, the hard gray walls looming like thick fog in the light. Her clothes were clean, her steps slow. She stared at the cab that waited for her.</p><p>\u201cWhere to, Miss?\u201d the driver called out.</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak, but Zane heard her thoughts so clearly, heard her-I don\u2019t have anywhere to go.</p><p>The images whirled through his mind. Jana, a few years older, with dark red hair now. She was in a diner, and a guy was yelling at the waitress. No one said anything when he started cursing at her. But when the waitress ended her shift, Jana followed the woman.</p><p>Jana watched through an open window, and she saw the waitress and her two kids ... and the man who\u2019d come to the diner, drunk, to make trouble for her. The woman\u2019s husband.</p><p>Only the guy wasn\u2019t just yelling now. He was hitting the wife and the kids.</p><p>Anger fueled Jana\u2019s blood. Hot, thick fury and the charge she\u2019d swore never to feel again coursed through her.</p><p>\u201cThe charge can come from anger, from rage.... It\u2019s so easy to stir the power. You just need the right stimulant.\u201d Her voice echoed in his ears as her fingers trailed down his chest.</p><p>When the wife ran out of her house, holding the kids, bleeding, she found Jana in her yard. \u201cI can make sure he never hurts you again,\u201d Jana said.</p><p>The woman stared back at her with terrified eyes and a broken jaw. Then she nodded. She didn\u2019t question Jana, didn\u2019t say so much as a word. But then, maybe she couldn\u2019t speak. Her jaw had doubled in size and the skin had already started to darken.</p><p>\u201cTake the kids away,\u201d Jana ordered. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to see ...\u201d</p><p>Then she walked into the house. The man came at her, swinging hamlike fists.</p><p>She trapped him in fire. Fire that she stirred, and he screamed and said she was a monster.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever go near her or the kids again, I\u2019ll burn the flesh right off your body. You won\u2019t even know I\u2019m there watching you until you smell the smoke. Smoke that will be coming from inside of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have killed him,\u201d Zane said, the memory of his mother fighting with Jana\u2019s images.</p><p>\u201cHe killed himself a week later. The drunk bastard drove straight off a bridge.\u201d</p><p>And he could see it. Because Jana had seen it.</p><p>More images tumbled through his mind. More fires, more threats. Not death, though. Her fires hadn\u2019t killed anyone until ...</p><p>A vampire grabbed her in a dark alley. She screamed, but no one came running to help her. The vampire shoved her against the side of a building, and he opened his mouth wide. \u201cReady to die, bitch?\u201d</p><p>The fire charged through her once more. \u201cDon\u2019t! You don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>His teeth drove into her neck.</p><p>Jana let the fire free.</p><p>\u201cI found out later that the folks from Perseus had seen everything that night. They\u2019d had the vamp under surveillance. In another few minutes, they were going to move in and save me.\u201d Her finger pressed against his chest. \u201cBut I saved myself first, and they saw what I could do. I was taken to the hospital right after that attack. Jesus, a vampire-I didn\u2019t even realize those guys existed until that night. I thought I was the only freak out there.\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t a freak. Beautiful. Sexy. Dangerous.</p><p>\u201cI told good old Nurse Nancy too much, but it wouldn\u2019t have mattered, really. Perseus already had me in their sights.\u201d</p><p>The image in his mind changed. He saw ...</p><p>Jana, sitting in a small chair. Beth sat on the other side of a dark, wooden desk. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know about the monsters, did you?\u201d Beth asked quietly.</p><p>Jana shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re evil, Jana. They\u2019re strong and they\u2019re evil and someone has to save all the innocent people in their path.\u201d A pause. \u201cYou\u2019ve saved people before, haven\u2019t you? You\u2019ve let your flames burn, and you\u2019ve saved lives.\u201d</p><p>Jana didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cWe need someone like you, Jana. Someone who is strong enough to fight back against them. Someone strong enough to kill them.\u201d</p><p>She flinched at that. \u201cI haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed the vampire.\u201d Beth\u2019s lips pursed. \u201cVampires burn so easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening\u2014\u201d An edge of hysteria entered her voice.</p><p>Beth rose and walked to Jana\u2019s side. Her eyes were glass hard. \u201cLet me sum things up for you. Monsters are real. They\u2019re evil, and if we don\u2019t stop them, they will destroy everything good in this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe showed me then. Took me on stakeouts with Perseus guards to see the monsters she wanted me to target. She wanted to point me and aim me and let my fire burn a path through every supernatural she wanted eliminated.\u201d Her breath shuddered out. \u201cWhen I didn\u2019t play ball, she just reorganized her game. She made me the bait, and the paranormals started coming after me. I had two choices then. Fight back or let them kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhore, you think I\u2019m gonna let you burn me?\u201d A demon walked from the mouth of a dark alley. His black gaze locked on Jana. \u201cI heard about you. An Ignitor who thinks she can hunt the demons here. Think-fuckin'-again. We\u2019re huntin\u2019 you!\u201d Three more demons sprang from the shadows, and they attacked her.</p><p>And the fire had burned.</p><p>\u201cI think she wanted to test my fire. To see if it was strong enough to use against demons.\u201d Flat. She shrugged. \u201cSince demons can conjure the flames, too, maybe she had to know just what her guinea pig could do.\u201d</p><p>What could she do? One hell of a lot. She\u2019d burned her way through the demons.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never gone up against a demon stronger than a level seven before.\u201d She gazed up at him. Waiting. \u201cBut I suspect a level seven or higher could easily beat back my flames.\u201d</p><p>Easily.</p><p>\u201cPerseus told me the demons I\u2019d taken out were killers. They showed me the photos of their victims. They told me I had a damn gift.\u201d Her lips twisted. \u201cI\u2019d always thought God cursed me, and here these people were telling me I had a gift.\u201d</p><p>More fires flashed through his mind. But Jana wasn\u2019t killing. Burning. Warning. But not killing. Demons ran. Shifters fled. No, she hadn\u2019t killed. She didn\u2019t kill... unless she caught the paranormals preying on humans. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A vampire caged a girl up against a tree. The girl-hell, she looked like she was about twelve. Her head was twisted, her neck bared, and the vamp\u2019s teeth were buried deep in her throat.</p><p>\u201cLet her go!\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t stop drinking. Didn\u2019t stop slurping down the girl\u2019s blood with deep, greedy gulps.</p> <p>So Jana let her fire burn. It raced toward him. She controlled it perfectly. The flames caught his legs but didn\u2019t touch the girl. The vampire whirled back, screaming, and lunged for her. The fire surged up, consuming him as the girl cried and stared at Jana in horror.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t understand that I was trying to help her. To her, I was just another monster.\u201d</p><p>As her voice filled his head, he realized then that Jana hadn\u2019t spoken, not out loud anyway, from the moment she\u2019d first whispered, \u201cCome in ...\u201d</p><p>He was in her mind, her words floating through his head, and she was guiding him. Showing him the things she wanted him to see. Telling him about her past. Baring her soul. A soul that wasn\u2019t perfect. Tarnished, just like his. But one that wasn\u2019t evil.</p><p>\u201cThey sent me after a shifter about a year ago. Told me he\u2019d been cutting the throats of co-eds in the area.\u201d Again, her voice was only in his head. Soft, flowing. Jana.</p> <p>\u201cBut I never went for a straight kill on my targets. I watched first, and he-he wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. I followed him for a solid month, and I never saw him even raise his voice to anyone.\u201d</p><p>An image flashed before him. A man, thin, tall, with bright blond hair. He walked down the road with the streetlights flickering over him.</p><p>\u201cHe was a wolf shifter. They told me all wolf shifters were psychotic. That he had to be put down to stop the killings.\u201d Her breath rasped out. Her scent surrounded them.</p><p>The man stopped at the mouth of an alley. A woman screamed. He ran inside. Two men had a woman pinned between them. They were ripping her shirt while she screamed and begged for them to stop.</p><p>\u201cHe shifted and saved her. Those men will wear his marks for the rest of their days, but the girl didn\u2019t get so much as a scratch from him.\u201d</p><p>Not a killer\u2019s M.O.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Perseus found out I hadn\u2019t eliminated him, well, they weren\u2019t pleased with me.\u201d</p><p>Jana and the wolf faced off. Another dark night, this one with a full moon. Perseus agents were in the background, easing close with guns ready.</p><p>\u201cThey set us up to meet. A recipe for death.\u201d</p><p>The wolf stared at her, his muscles locked. Saliva dripped from his fangs.</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to burn him.\u201d</p><p>The wolf threw his head back and howled. A long, sad wail of mourning. Then he walked to her and lowered his muzzle.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t attacking me. He wasn\u2019t attacking anyone. So I stood back, and I let him go ... and he wasn\u2019t the last.\u201d But Perseus hadn\u2019t liked that.</p><p>\u201cJust because you\u2019re a monster, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re evil. I broke into Beth\u2019s office. I found out that she\u2019d been doctoring the files. That wolf-his girlfriend had been killed by a human serial killer. The killer slashed her throat, and she bled out before the shifter could get to her. Yeah, the shifter had killed, but he killed the bastard who murdered his girlfriend. Not anyone else. All those other girls ... a human murdered them all.\u201d</p> <p>But Perseus had still put the shifter on their hit list.</p><p>\u201cGuess the powers that be at Perseus didn\u2019t like that I started questioning their orders. ...\u201d</p><p>Jana lay bound to a hard metal table. Two men in white lab coats loomed over her.</p><p>\u201cBut I was tired of being their pit bull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have just done your job, Jana. Killed the freaks and done your damn job.\u201d Beth\u2019s voice. She stepped forward, her arms crossed over her chest. \u201cWe don\u2019t tolerate failure here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me.\u201d The words came, slow and sluggish because they\u2019d drugged her.</p><p>Beth\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cThe wolf is going to die. It\u2019s a matter of time. He\u2019s going to die and so are you.\u201d</p><p>Then the two men reached for her, scalpels in their hands.</p><p>\u201cThey liked pain.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the ... only one they worked on. While I was with them, I saw-I saw the supernaturals they brought in. Those doctors cut them open. Hell, they did it while they were alive. They cut them, and they tortured them just to see how much pain they could take. We were all just experiments to them.\u201d</p><p>And he saw the blood-soaked images. One after the other.</p><p>\u201cThey made a mistake with me. They needed to keep me conscious while they cut into my head, and they didn\u2019t drug me heavily enough.\u201d</p><p>The damn scalpels glinted. Each bastard had one gripped in a white-gloved hand. \u201cToday we slice into that brain. Let\u2019s see if she\u2019s wired to burn.\u201d</p><p>Jana\u2019s eyes had gone to the men. Marked them. Even as Beth\u2019s high heels tapped across the tiled floor, Jana let the power swell. The heat spread through her as the charge grew, burning hotter, hotter as it swelled with her rage. The fire erupted.</p><p>He jerked back, almost feeling the flames on his skin. But, no, that hadn\u2019t been real. The room was cold. Ice cold. Jana stood before him. Just her. No flames.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve improved on their drugs since my last ... stay.\u201d Again, he heard her thoughts because he was still in her mind. \u201cThey\u2019re keeping the room cold to further lock down my power. Unless I can charge up, I\u2019m going to be powerless, and they know that.\u201d</p><p>She stepped forward. Closing the space he\u2019d created when he stumbled back. \u201cI need to get warm.\u201d Whispered in his mind. The fingertips she pressed to his cheek seemed so cold. Not like Jana\u2019s hot touch. \u201cHelp me.\u201d When she exhaled, he saw a faint puff of white near her lips. Too cold.</p><p>He wanted to help her. After what he\u2019d seen ... fuck, life wasn\u2019t black and white, he knew that. Jana wasn\u2019t the heartless assassin he\u2019d originally pictured. But he\u2019d already known that, even without slipping into her past.</p><p>His gift. He didn\u2019t just pick up on thoughts when he went into someone\u2019s mind. He saw the person\u2019s life. Hell, that was one of the many reasons he never went inside a human\u2019s head.</p><p>Sometimes, you didn\u2019t want to see the dark deeds that should stay hidden.</p><p>Jana\u2019s past wasn\u2019t pretty, but then, neither was his.</p><p>\u201cSex can charge me.\u201d The words echoed in his mind though her lips never moved. \u201cWhen the lust burns inside, it\u2019ll push back the fog from the drugs and help me to fight the cold.\u201d Her gaze held his. \u201cDon\u2019t let me be weak when they come back for me.\u201d</p><p>Zane swallowed.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Her whisper broke the air and broke him.</p><p>His mouth pressed against hers even as his hands reached for her. He pulled her close, so close, crushing her against him. There\u2019d be no time for finesse. No gentle loving. The assholes out there could come in at any moment, and he\u2019d be damned if he left her weak.</p><p>The moment their lips touched, the lust flared between them. The need, the desire that was always so close when she was around him erupted. Her lips were soft, silken, and her tongue moved eagerly to meet his.</p><p>Her nipples stabbed against his chest and a low murmur rolled in her throat. She might want him to touch her so that her power would come back, but she also just wanted him. That was damn good, because he sure wanted her.</p><p>Zane lifted his head and his power poured out. It surged around them, and a gray fog swirled in the air. The fog thickened, tightening, making a wall around their bodies, and blocking the preying eyes. There was no way he\u2019d let those bastards see him with Jana.</p><p>Her lips lifted in the briefest of smiles. \u201cI knew you were strong,\u201d she whispered and took his mouth again. Lips, tongue, need.</p><p>His heart thudded in his chest. The assholes watching the cameras would freak out when they saw the fog. They wouldn\u2019t have much time.</p><p>Enough time ...</p><p>His hands pushed between them. He found the snap of her jeans. Jerked the button, eased down the zipper. \u201cZane...\u201d</p><p>He shoved the jeans down. His fingers pushed under the elastic edge of her panties and found plump, sweet flesh. Her nails sank into his arms as she held on tight.</p><p>\u201cBurn for me,\u201d he whispered as he let his mouth feather over her throat. \u201cBurn.\u201d His fingers stroked her sex. His thumb pushed down on her clit and the scent of her arousal teased his nostrils.</p><p>He wanted her legs spread wide. Wanted to lick his way across that pink flesh. But...</p><p>No time.</p><p>His cock shoved against the front of his jeans. Hard, swollen, and probably getting an imprint of a zipper on the flesh.</p><p>Take her, take\u2014</p><p>His fingers plunged inside of her. Two fingers, knuckle deep. Jana rose onto her toes, even as her eyes widened with a surge of pleasure.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t burning yet, but she would be, soon.</p><p>Footsteps pounded in the hallway. Fuck.</p><p>Not enough ... not enough.</p><p>He bit her on the neck, a rough score with his teeth. Not too hard. A marking because demons liked to mark their prey, too.</p><p>His fingers withdrew, then drove deep. Again, again. He worked a third finger into her. She was slick and eager now, her flesh yielding so sweetly to him.</p><p>\u201cZane ... hurry ... no time ...\u201d Her hands went to his waist. Fumbled with the snap of his jeans.</p><p>More footsteps, closer, closer ...</p><p>\u201cI need you in me,\u201d she said, her eyes wide, hungry, lost. \u201cZane, I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>His thumb pushed over the center of her need. His fingers claimed her flesh again, and her whole body stiffened. Jana stared at him with wide eyes.</p><p>And came.</p><p>He kissed her, thrusting his tongue into her mouth even as his fingers continued to thrust into her silken warmth. Thrusting and drawing out the orgasm that squeezed his fingers.</p><p>Voices rose in the hall. The door began to squeak.</p><p>He kept his mouth on hers. His lips were softer now, easier. The lust still rode him, a hunger so deep that he ached. Want inside. Want her legs around me. Want her sex squeezing me.</p><p>He shuddered against her.</p><p>\u201cJana!\u201d Beth\u2019s angry voice.</p><p>Fucking company.</p><p>He eased away. Jana stared up at him. A frown pulled her brows low. Her cheeks were flushed. Her lips parted.</p><p>Zane bent and pulled up her jeans. Her hands reached out, tangling with his. \u201cWhy did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. The door burst open.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the fog slipped away, and he found himself staring at Beth and six armed guards. Zane moved forward, putting his body between them and Jana.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell have you done?\u201d Beth demanded.</p><p>Not nearly as much as he would have liked. But Beth didn\u2019t know that. The Perseus agent didn\u2019t know a damn thing.</p><p>\u201cGet him out of here,\u201d she barked and a light puff of air appeared before her mouth. Was it really that cold? Once he\u2019d started touching Jana, he hadn\u2019t even noticed.</p><p>The guards marched toward him. Zane lifted his hands, more than ready to blast them back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a friend of yours waiting to meet you,\u201d Beth said and he didn\u2019t like the calculation in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDoubtful. I don\u2019t think any of my friends would be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmm.\u201d Her gaze tried to flicker to Jana, but he didn\u2019t move. They weren\u2019t getting to her yet. Every second that passed was a second she got stronger. Don\u2019t worry, baby, you won\u2019t be weak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve realized that we must have used one very powerful witch to keep you locked in this room.\u201d A delicate pause, and Beth didn\u2019t strike him as the delicate type. \u201cNot that we wanted to lock you up, but until you can see reason, we have no choice.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah, right. They were doing a bang-up job of convincing him that Perseus was a bright, shiny, happy corporation-of killers.</p><p>\u201cEveryone always has choice,\u201d he threw back. Like his choice right now was to let these idiots feel his power or ...</p><p>Or wait. Because every damn snake had a head and if he wanted to destroy Perseus, he had to take the head. Cut the thing off. If he just blew his way through the flunkies, he\u2019d be wasting his time. But it would feel real good.</p><p>\u201cYou have a choice now,\u201d Beth said. \u201cYou can go with the guards and get reacquainted with your friend, or you can leave the facility.\u201d</p><p>Leave? Sure, they\u2019d just let him walk out. Did he look stupid?</p><p>\u201cI notice you aren\u2019t giving me any choices.\u201d Jana\u2019s quiet voice carried easily, and then she stepped to his side. A swift glance showed she was all buttoned up. Her clothes were back in place and no trace of passion or lust showed on her face.</p><p>Meanwhile his cock was still up and aching-and even the guns pointing at him weren\u2019t slowing him down.</p><p>Jana shivered, a quick movement that shook her body. A movement that Beth caught because her lips began to twist- but she stopped herself before smiling fully. Instead, the agent said, \u201cOh, Jana, I\u2019m sorry, is it too cold in here for you?\u201d</p><p>Another delicate shiver. \u201cCold? No ... I\u2019m just fine.\u201d Her shoulders straightened.</p><p>\u201cGo with the guards, Zane,\u201d Beth urged him. \u201cLet us reassure you about Perseus without Jana\u2019s ... ah, bias ... coming in the way.\u201d</p><p>Bias? Is that what it was?</p><p>\u201cAnd Jana ...\u201d Now Beth\u2019s eyes locked on her. \u201cYour status has recently changed. You are no longer a person of interest for Perseus. If you leave tonight, you won\u2019t be followed again. You\u2019ll be free.\u201d</p><p>What? They\u2019d gone to all the trouble of tracking her, they\u2019d locked them in this ice box, and now they were just going to let them both walk? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bullshit.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t come after us,\u201d Beth continued, \u201cand we\u2019ll forget you exist.\u201d</p><p>Baring her teeth, Jana said, \u201cDon\u2019t know if I can make that promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell...\u201d Beth\u2019s head inclined toward her. \u201cPerhaps you and I can make a deal.\u201d</p><p>Now what the hell was that about?</p><p>\u201cI doubt that, lady.\u201d Jana\u2019s arms crossed over her chest.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wynter?\u201d Beth motioned to the guards. \u201cI really must insist you leave with my men now.\u201d</p><p>He let a smile curve his lips. \u201cYou know, I think the guys with the guns really wreck this lie of a friendly conversation.\u201d But he walked forward. He\u2019d come to Perseus for a reason, and he wasn\u2019t leaving until he\u2019d finished his mission. Zane tossed a quick glance back at Jana. You okay? He let the question drift on the psychic link they\u2019d made.</p> <p>She gave the briefest of nods.</p><p>\u201cOf course, she\u2019s okay,\u201d Beth said. \u201cI think you\u2019ll soon realize that Jana is a lot stronger than she looks.\u201d Well, shit, Beth was psychic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already realized it,\u201d he said, striding for the door and guarding his thoughts now. \u201cI think you\u2019re the one in for the surprise.\u201d</p><p>When Zane left, the door shut behind him with a hollow clang of sound. Jana didn\u2019t move. She kept her eyes on the woman she really wanted to rip apart, the only woman in the room with her.</p><p>Beth Parker. The agent who\u2019d lured her in. The agent who\u2019d stood there and watched while she was tortured. The agent who\u2019d turned Jana into a wanted woman.</p><p>You took away my life.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell kind of game are you playing now?\u201d Jana asked. She knew Beth was psychic. They both were-that had been part of Beth\u2019s Perseus recruitment spiel. Come ... be with others who are just like you. You don\u2019t have to be alone anymore.</p><p>Blah-fucking-blah.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing a game.\u201d Beth\u2019s heels tapped on the tile as she crossed toward her. \u201cI\u2019m trying to show Mr. Wynter that Perseus isn\u2019t as evil as you think.\u201d</p><p>Jana laughed at that. \u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re worse than I think.\u201d</p><p>Beth shook her head. \u201cThings were going so well. I was pleased with your progress.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThen that shifter screwed things up for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean things got screwed when you wanted me to kill an innocent man?\u201d The lady was good at twisting details.</p><p>Beth\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t innocent. He\u2019d killed a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA human who murdered his girlfriend and half a dozen other girls. Call me crazy, but I think that\u2019s justifiable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d Her jaw clenched and Beth gritted out, \u201cOnce the wolves start killing, they can\u2019t stop. He\u2019d crossed a line. He was psychotic. He\u2019d attack again and again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t he kill the girl in the alley? Huh? Why didn\u2019t he kill me?\u201d</p><p>Click. Click. The heels were moving again. \u201cIf we don\u2019t stop the paranormals out there, they will take over our world. Humans will be damn servants. Prey. We\u2019ll be the food they hunt at night, and we\u2019ll have nothing.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d heard that spiel before, too. At one time, she\u2019d believed it. \u201cThey\u2019re not all bad, Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re sure as shit not all good, Jana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s all good.\u201d Not me. Not you.</p><p>Beth inclined her head. The red on her cheek looked even angrier in the hard light. \u201cI know.\u201d A touch of sadness coated the words, but then she lifted her chin. \u201cI\u2019ve been authorized to offer you a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Were they really back to this? Jana uncrossed her arms and let her hands slip to her sides. \u201cYou\u2019ve been authorized to kill me. You think I don\u2019t see right through this act? I knew the minute you took Zane out of here that you\u2019d be coming at me.\u201d She kept her mind blank, not wanting Beth to pick up on her plans.</p><p>But Beth\u2019s brows rose. \u201cKilling you was never the plan for me. You\u2019re a human. I don\u2019t kill humans.\u201d</p><p>Liar, liar. Beth might not like killing humans, but she executed the ones that got in her way, and she didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cOh, right, your preferred method of attack with humans is to wreck their lives. Make \u2018em into wanted criminals and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was simply trying to bring you back home.\u201d Again she spoke with that wistfulness that could have been sadness. \u201cI liked you, Jana. In so many ways, you reminded me of\u201d-a light laugh\u2014\u201cme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell call me a freaking mirror.\u201d Fury spiked in her blood.</p><p>Beth\u2019s gaze raked her. \u201cThere are two ways this can work.\u201d</p><p>Jana stared at her and pictured darkness. A wall of perfect black in her mind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not strong enough to take Perseus down. You don\u2019t even have a clue of just how powerful we are. You can try.\u201d Beth shrugged. \u201cBut you\u2019ll fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what? This polite bullshit is wearing thin. Zane\u2019s not here, so you don\u2019t have to pretend you\u2019re anything other than a cold-blooded killer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOption two is that I take that fire away from you.\u201d</p><p>Jana\u2019s mouth went dry.</p><p>\u201cAh ... I\u2019ve got your attention, don\u2019t I? You know we can\u2019t just let you loose out there, Jana. If you\u2019re not on our side, you\u2019re too dangerous ... as you are.\u201d Beth exhaled heavily. \u201cBut with a few modifications, you wouldn\u2019t be a threat anymore. You\u2019d just be a regular human. Like all the others we protect.\u201d</p><p>Still spouting that protection bull, but ... \u201cYou can stop the fire?\u201d She had to ask.</p><p>A slow nod. Beth\u2019s blond hair brushed against her fire-stained cheek. \u201cYou can be normal, Jana. It will only take a few moments. Just a few. Then you can walk out of here and have the life you\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d</p><p>The temptation was so strong. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hunting me all this time ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re too dangerous with the fire.\u201d Her jaw hardened, stretching those scars. \u201cWithout it, you\u2019re no threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I keep my fire ...?\u201d</p><p>Beth didn\u2019t speak. But then, Jana already knew the answer. Keep it and die. Because she wasn\u2019t just going to have the chance to walk away with her power.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to be normal?\u201d Beth inched closer. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what it\u2019s like to have a family? Real friends? To not be the freak who\u2019s always standing on the outside?\u201d Beth\u2019s hand lifted. The hand marked with the raised and red flesh reached toward Jana. \u201cI can give it to you. I can give your life back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you get?\u201d Because she wasn\u2019t a fool. No way would Perseus toss her this shiny, tasty apple without having one big worm crawling around inside of it.</p><p>\u201cWe get you off our asses.\u201d</p><p>If only it were that simple.</p><p>\u201cIt is that simple, Jana. Just take what we\u2019re offering, and walk away.\u201d</p><p>Davey waited for him in the hallway. When he saw the guards lead Zane out, his lips tightened. \u201cI got him, okay, guys? Go take a break.\u201d</p><p>The guards didn\u2019t move. Davey straightened away from the wall. \u201dI\u2019ve got him.\u201d</p><p>They shuffled back.</p><p>\u201cBeth wants me to take you to meet the witch,\u201d Davey told him, thrusting back his shoulders. \u201cShe thinks Jana\u2019s screwed with your mind. Convinced you that we\u2019re evil.\u201d</p><p>No, when they\u2019d blown up Night Watch\u2014that had convinced him.</p><p>\u201cBut maybe ... maybe if you can hear that we aren\u2019t monsters, if you hear that from someone you trust, you\u2019ll believe us. You\u2019ll realize that Perseus isn\u2019t some sick nightmare that needs to be put down.\u201d A deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019re a group that you can join. You can help us, we can help you, and in the end, we\u2019d make this world one hell of a lot better.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared back at him. Someone that you trust. At those words, he\u2019d gotten a real bad feeling in his gut. There was only one witch that he truly trusted in the world. She\u2019d disappeared from Baton Rouge a few months back, right after Dee Daniels, another Night Watch agent, had almost been killed. \u201cTake me to the fucking witch.\u201d Now.</p><p>Davey turned away and led him down the hall. Past the locked, metal doors. Past more guards.</p><p>Zane\u2019s heartbeat thundered in his ears. There was no way, no damn way, that they were talking about the same witch. They couldn\u2019t be. They\u2014</p><p>Davey opened a door. The room inside was dim. A long, skinny table, a few chairs, and a woman waited inside. The woman spun toward them, her hair-so blond it was almost white-flying around her face. Oh, hell.</p><p>\u201cZane? she breathed his name.</p><p>He stared at the witch he\u2019d known for five years. His ex-lover, a woman he\u2019d trusted with his darkest secrets: Catalina Delaney.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, Catalina,\u201d Davey said, walking closer to her. \u201cTell your friend the truth about Perseus. Tell him that Jana Carter lied to him. Tell him what we\u2019re really like.\u201d</p><p>He stared into her moss-green eyes-eyes the color of the swamp she\u2019d been raised in-and waited for the truth. Because Catalina had never lied to him before.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not evil, Zane,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThey want to save the world. Not destroy it.\u201d</p><p>No, she\u2019d never lied to him before.</p><p>So why was she starting now?</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t the only humans with psychic powers.\u201d Beth licked her lips. \u201cThere are others out there, so many others.\u201d</p><p>Really? Where had they been all her life? While Jana was feeling like a freak, where had they been?</p><p>\u201cSome powers aren\u2019t strong. Some people can just see the briefest glimpses of the future. So many have weak talents.\u201d</p><p>She just stared at Beth. Being weak wasn\u2019t really an issue for her when it came to power.</p><p>\u201cOthers are stronger with more ... unusual gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u2018Cause what? Creating fire was common?</p><p>Beth\u2019s gaze pinned her. \u201cRecently, we found an individual with a power we\u2019d never imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood damn deal for you.\u201d She was charged enough. She didn\u2019t even feel the cold anymore, though Beth had started to shiver. Time to blast her way out of this room. Time to blast Perseus apart. There were other paranormals imprisoned here. She\u2019d bet on it. She could free them, get to safety, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cThis woman we found ... she can touch you and take away your power.\u201d</p><p>Jana\u2019s breath caught in her throat.</p><p>Beth smiled. \u201cI thought you might be curious about her. You see, if she touches you, all that wonderful fire will go away, and you\u2019ll be normal again. You won\u2019t be a threat to Perseus.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be a threat to anyone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave you alone,\u201d Beth promised. \u201cAnd you can just walk away. You\u2019ll be able to live a normal life.\u201d</p><p>Jana\u2019s breath shot out on a long, hard exhale.</p><p>Beth held her gaze. \u201cDo you want that, Jana? Would you like to be normal? To be just like everyone else? All you have to do\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door opened behind Beth and a young girl walked inside. The girl appeared to be maybe nineteen or twenty. She wore thick glasses, and she had long, straight brown hair that hid half of her face.</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do,\u201d Beth said again, \u201cis just let her touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying, Catalina,\u201d Zane said. He shook his head. \u201cDid you really think I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell when you lied to me?\u201d</p><p>She smiled then, a wide, full smile. \u201cNo, Zane. I was sure you\u2019d know.\u201d Then she lifted up her hands and said, \u201cNow, please, help me get the hell out of here!\u201d</p><p>A dozen guards exploded into the room behind her.</p><p>Davey yelled, \u201cWhat the fu\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head. So much for the lying front. His power erupted and hit them all.</p><p>Jana\u2019s hands tightened into fists. \u201cDon\u2019t take another step.\u201d The girl stilled.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when she takes the fire away?\u201d Oh, so tempting. \u201cWhere does it go?\u201d</p><p>Beth blinked. \u201cNowhere. It won\u2019t hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>Bull. \u201cYou take it, where does it go?\u201d Because this crap wasn\u2019t making sense. Perseus had been desperate to get her back. So desperate they\u2019d tracked her across Louisiana. If they\u2019d just wanted her out of the picture, she would have been dead.</p><p>They didn\u2019t want her dead. They wanted her alive. Because they couldn\u2019t take the fire from a dead woman?</p><p>The girl wasn\u2019t speaking. Her dark eyes looked so big behind the glasses, and her skin was stark white.</p><p>An alarm sounded then. A high-pitched, whining alarm. Beth flinched and swore. \u201cDumb bitch. She should\u2019ve just done her damn part.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>Footsteps pounded outside. Sounded like guards were racing toward them.</p><p>Beth\u2019s face hardened. Her hand lifted, and she stabbed a finger in the air toward Jana. \u201cThe demon is going to die. If he won\u2019t help us, then we\u2019ll rip him apart.\u201d</p><p>Shit. So much for playing nice. Now the mask was gone and she was back to seeing the real Beth.</p><p>\u201cBut first...\u201d Beth said, pausing as the guards spilled into the room. \u201cFirst we\u2019re taking that fire from you. We\u2019re taking it, and we\u2019re going to make sure you\u2019re nothing but a corpse when we leave this room.\u201d</p><p>Now, this was the Beth she knew and hated. \u201cBring it, bitch.\u201d Jana let the charge shoot through her. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re strong enough, come on.\u201d A line of fire split the floor between them. Charge more. Charge. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you still like my fire.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShoot her!\u201d Beth screamed at the guards. \u201cNot the head or the heart, but shoot her! Take her down!\u201d</p><p>The bullets flew through the air as the flames blazed higher.</p><p>Zane scooped up Catalina and held her tight. He ran out of the room and into the narrow hallway. That screaming alarm pierced his ears. A constant, high-pitched wail that threatened to burst his ear drums. He blasted his power out in waves, knocking back every guard he saw as he shoved his energy at them.</p> <p>Jana. He needed to get to her. He didn\u2019t know how long her charge would last and\u2014</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d Catalina\u2019s breathy voice. He glanced down. Her eyes were fluttering open. Witches were so incredibly strong. He\u2019d figured that she would wake up fast.</p><p>He put his back against the nearest wall and eased Catalina to her feet. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d The last time he\u2019d seen her, they\u2019d both been in a shit-forsaken vampire hell. The vamps had surrounded Catalina with fire. Burn, witch. He\u2019d gotten to her in time, saved her from the touch of fire, but she\u2019d still left. Still left because ...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one for you. \u201c Her words echoed through his mind. Catalina had scryed to see the future, and what she\u2019d seen had made her run.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t heard from her in months. Had she been here the whole time? Trapped by Perseus?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I wanted to be here.\u201d Her breath shuddered out, and she yanked up the sleeve of her shirt. There, on her upper arm, he saw two thin white lines. Scars. No, hell, no. Binding marks. He\u2019d only seen them once before in his life, but he knew what they were-marks to bind a witch\u2019s power.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a coven to protect me.\u201d Her gaze was steady, proud. \u201cWhen the agents came to me, I didn\u2019t realize what they had planned for me, not until it was too late.\u201d</p><p>Until the first binding mark appeared.</p><p>\u201cThree marks,\u201d she whispered and he heard her, even with the wailing alarm. \u201cThree and I\u2019m completely helpless. With two\u201d-she swallowed\u2014\u201cmy powers became so weak, I wasn\u2019t able to fight back against the bastards.\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cI\u2019m getting you out of here.\u201d</p><p>But she shook her head. \u201cThere are others here. I won\u2019t leave them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOthers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wolf shifter ... and a vampire. I won\u2019t leave them.\u201d</p><p>A woman\u2019s scream ripped through the air. Jana. He lunged forward. Catalina grabbed his arm. \u201cThey want you. They\u2019ve seen what you can do. If they can keep you here, if they can use you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s gonna fucking use me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were going to kill me two days ago,\u201d she told him, her lips trembling. \u201cThen they realized I knew you. I\u2019m alive just because\u2014\u201d</p><p>Another scream. Jana. He broke Catalina\u2019s hold. \u201cCat, get out of here! Run, and I\u2019ll find you!\u201d But first, he was getting</p><p>Jana.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alive because I told them your weakness.\u201d Her whispered words floated behind him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Zane.\u201d He spun back to face her. \u201cCat?\u201d</p> <p>Her shoulders were slumped. Her head down. \u201cThey were going to put on the third bind. I didn\u2019t have a choice. They know about\u2014\u201d</p><p>The drugs. Shit.</p><p>She looked up at him. A tear tracked down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The screams had stopped. He could smell smoke drifting in the air. Coming closer. \u201cFire\u2019s coming.\u201d Catalina\u2019s weakness. \u201cGet out. Just run!\u201d</p><p>Fear had her eyes flaring wide, but she shook her head. \u201cNot without the others.\u201d She stumbled down the hallway, lifting her hand toward him. \u201cCome with me, Zane. Don\u2019t go back, they\u2019re waiting for you! It\u2019s all a trap.\u201d</p><p>He knew it, but ... \u201cThey\u2019ve got someone I\u2014\u201d Someone, what? Someone he needed? Someone he sure as shit wouldn\u2019t leave behind? She didn\u2019t leave me. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving her,\u201d was all he said.</p><p>Catalina\u2019s lips parted, and her eyes seemed to lose a bit of focus. The shift in her glance always happened when she used her magic. \u201cNo.\u201d A bit sad. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave her.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t time to waste. Zane ran down the hall, bellowing Jana\u2019s name.</p><p>A mass of swirling and crackling flames shot down the hallway. He shoved the fire to the side even as water poured down from the sprinklers above him. What the hell?</p><p>The door to the holding room was open. He rushed inside, and the smoke shoved its way down his throat. \u201cJana! Jana, pull back the fire!\u201d</p><p>But Jana was lying in the middle of the room with her hair a black curtain around her face. Flames ate at the walls and the ceiling.</p><p>Beth stood near those flames, her body swaying.</p><p>Hell. He poured his power out as he fought the flames. The heat scorched his flesh.</p><p>The fire retreated from him, and he leapt to Jana\u2019s side. She was slowly pushing herself up.</p><p>\u201cPull it back,\u201d he growled, locking his fingers around her arms as he drew her close. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby, I\u2019m here now, you can ease up on the f\u2014\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. Her eyes were tired, weak, and dark blue.</p><p>He heard the laughter then. Wild, wicked laughter. He turned his head and found Beth staring at him-with eyes gone dark red.</p><p>\u201cN-not me ...\u201d Jana whispered as her hands twisted to hold tight to him. Her nails sank into his skin. \u201cNot a-anymore.\u201d</p><p>Another ball of flames shot straight at him. He threw his body over Jana\u2019s even as he sent the fire slamming into the south-side wall with a psychic surge of energy. Jana coughed beneath him and shuddered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to die, demon!\u201d Beth yelled, her voice rising above the flames. \u201cYou\u2019re both going to burn!\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced up and saw the flames rolling over the ceiling. Looked like clouds of fire. Not. Good.</p><p>\u201cYou should have joined us when you had the chance.\u201d More laughter from Beth. \u201cNow I\u2019ll just burn you until there\u2019s nothing left.\u201d</p><p>The hell she would.</p><p>Zane threw up his hands, pushing a powerful wave of energy at her just as Beth\u2019s flames came for him again. The flames froze in mid-air, caught between them, and Beth screamed.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be able to ... handle it....\u201d Jana coughed again and pushed against him. \u201cNot the first time ... not...\u201d</p><p>The flames swelled. They shoved against his hold. Burned so hot.</p><p>\u201cThe ceiling\u2019s gonna fall. ...\u201d Jana jerked from beneath him. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here!\u201d Her hands grabbed at his arms. \u201dCome on!\u201d</p><p>Beth screamed again, a loud, desperate cry as she fell to her knees. The flames erupted, shooting across the room, and chunks of the ceiling fell down, crashing onto the floor.</p><p>He ran with Jana, holding back the fire and charging for the door. The smoke, heavy and gray, blocked their path, but they barreled straight through it and, with his help, through the flames.</p><p>Beth\u2019s yells followed them, blending with the piercing alarm, and the crackle of the fire.</p><p>He and Jana thundered down the hallway. Guards were running, hell-bent on getting away from the flames so they didn\u2019t even toss him or Jana a second glance. The guards sure didn\u2019t try to stop them. Too busy running.</p><p>Zane risked a glance behind him. The fire was destroying everything, burning so bright. Sending screams of terror into the air. As he watched, two men appeared near the back wall. Chameleons being forced out of their camouflage because of the fire\u2019s heat. One of the bastards was the one who\u2019d attacked Jana.</p><p>He was burning, screaming as he fell to the ground. The flames flared higher around him and the other chameleon. Trapping them, killing them.</p><p>Zane\u2019s legs pumped as he searched for a way out of the nightmare. Not Jana\u2019s fire. What the hell had happened? And why hadn\u2019t Jana mentioned that Beth was an Ignitor?</p><p>Fuck. Just when he\u2019d thought he could trust her ...</p><p>They burst through some double doors and out into the night. Jana sucked in deep gulps of air and fell to her knees.</p><p>The clean air almost seemed to burn his lungs. \u201cJana ...\u201d His voice sounded like gravel.</p><p>Her head turned toward him. Her eyes were wet with tears. From the smoke? Or something more?</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d He lifted her up and carried her farther away from that burning building and the screams that echoed inside. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me what Beth could do?\u201d</p><p>She just shook her head.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He sat her down near the edge of the swamp. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his arms. \u201cWhere ... are you going?\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a friend in there. I\u2019m not leaving her for the flames.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t leave Catalina to her worst nightmare.</p><p>\u201cFriend?\u201d Her brow wrinkled. Ash stained her cheeks. \u201cWith ... Perseus?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, okay, that sounded screwed. \u201cJust stay here, okay?\u201d But even as he said the words, he knew she\u2019d be gone when he came back. It was her perfect chance to run. \u201cThey\u2019ve got supernaturals caged in there.\u201d His voice grew stronger with every word, just as those flames were growing stronger with every second that passed. \u201cI\u2019m not letting them burn.\u201d</p><p>Perseus was dying tonight, burning to the ground, but they weren\u2019t taking the paranormals out with them.</p><p>He whirled away from Jana and ran right back into the fire.</p><p>Jana shook her head, stunned, as Zane disappeared into the smoke again. What was he thinking? Didn\u2019t he realize those flames weren\u2019t going to stop? They were blazing out of control. Even a level ten couldn\u2019t fight them-not with an Ignitor constantly charging them up. The first fire is always the hottest. Too strong. Can\u2019t stop it.</p><p>She lifted a shaking hand to her head. Oh, God, how had this happened? One minute, that girl had been running toward her, and Jana had been getting her charge strong enough to blast, then\u2014</p><p>Then Beth had been in control of the flames.</p><p>And I\u2019d had nothing.</p><p>Jana had been surrounded by fire but, for the first time, completely at its mercy. If Zane hadn\u2019t come in there, she would have died.</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut. I\u2019ve got a friend in there. I\u2019m not leaving her for the flames. Beth had taunted him about a friend. We\u2019ve got a friend of yours waiting to meet you.</p><p>What friend?</p><p>She stumbled to her feet. A guard ran out of the smoke. He didn\u2019t glance her way. He just raced for the truck parked near the line of twisted trees.</p><p>Trying to get away?</p><p>She sucked in another breath and went after him. \u201cHey, hey, wait!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the door handle and wrenched open the door.</p><p>\u201cLook, buddy\u2014\u201d</p><p>He swung around to face her. Jana slammed her fist into his face. She might not have her fire right then, but she wasn\u2019t helpless.</p><p>The guy sank to the ground. She went with him, patting his pockets, finding his keys, a cell phone, and-yes!-a gun. Jana tucked the gun into the waistband of her jeans and glanced back at the fire. Zane was in there. Other paranormals were trapped inside. She looked down at her hands. Cell phone. Keys. The perfect time to escape. There were no more ties to her past. Perseus wouldn\u2019t come after her. She could get away clean.</p><p>But Zane was in the fire.</p><p>Zane.</p><p>She punched in a quick series of numbers on the cell phone. Numbers she\u2019d memorized earlier, when she\u2019d seen Zane make one of his calls. The phone rang once, twice\u2014</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is this?\u201d a snarling voice demanded.</p><p>Jana\u2019s fingers tightened around the phone. \u201cI\u2019m calling about Zane Wynter.\u201d She didn\u2019t have a whole lot of time to waste.</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d The voice quieted. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinda hard to say.\u201d She bit her lip and rose, stepping away from the fallen guard and keeping his keys. She had to strain to make her voice louder and clearer when she said, \u201cHe\u2019s in the fire right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where we are,\u201d she said. \u201cSome damn swamp.\u201d</p><p>Other voices murmured in the background, then he told her, \u201cJust keep the phone on. We can find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend some fire trucks, would you?\u201d She watched those flames blaze. They\u2019d burned through the roof and were reaching so high. With a fire like this, there was only one way to stop the flames. Just one ... \u201cPeople are still inside. They need help.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Then he asked, \u201cIs it your fire, Jana?\u201d</p><p>It should have been. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the phone on,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just get help out here, got it? Perseus is burning, but I\u2019m not letting them destroy Zane.\u201d</p><p>Then she put the phone on the hood of the truck and made the stupidest move of her life. She went back into the fire.</p><p>\u201cHelp me...\u201d The voice drew Zane in closer. It was weak, rough, desperate. Not Catalina.</p><p>He found himself in the same conference room he\u2019d been in when he\u2019d first seen Catalina. The fire had already come inside, the flames surging against the walls. The guards were gone. They\u2019d cleared out fast, but then, his psychic blast wouldn\u2019t have kept them knocked out for long.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen a fire like this one. Even with his power, it was hard to push the flames back. And if he hadn\u2019t been so high on the demon scale then he never would have been able to clear a path back inside. The fire was too wild.</p><p>The flames weren\u2019t just sticking to the walls. They were surging forward, actually tracking people-as if they were intent on killing. Hell, they were intent. An Ignitor aimed the fire where she wanted it. Beth wanted the fire to kill, and it was. Only, it wasn\u2019t just killing Beth\u2019s enemies. It was killing everyone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHelp ... me ...\u201d The voice came again and Zane hurried forward, even as he shoved back those greedy flames. He rushed down the hallway and turned right. Another room, this one with chains on the walls.</p><p>He found Davey on the floor. His legs were pinned by a heavy metal cage that had fallen onto him. Hell, this must be some kind of damn containment room. Fire circled around Davey, but the demon held the flames back from him, keeping a protective circle around his body. A circle that barely seemed to be holding. Blood dripped from his temple. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me here.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared down at the kid. \u201cYou chose the wrong side.\u201d</p> <p>Tears leaked from his eyes. \u201cI chose the-the only side that I had! I was trying-trying to save l-lives!\u201d The fire inched closer. Young Davey wasn\u2019t a strong demon, that much was obvious, or he would have freed himself by now.</p><p>A weak demon. A kid. One who\u2019d been pulled in and used by humans gone crazy with their own power.</p><p>\u201cTell me where you keep the paranormal prisoners.\u201d</p><p>The flames inched closer to Davey\u2019s legs. That circle was failing. The demon screamed.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p> <p>Davey broke. His face crumpled and he cried out, \u201cEnd of the hall, go right!\u201d He pointed with a trembling hand. \u201cThird door! They weren\u2019t hurt, they weren\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were.\u201d Disgust had his voice thickening, but Zane waved his own hand and the metal flew off Davey\u2019s legs.</p><p>The guy gasped, staring up at him with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not all evil, kid. You need to start realizing that.\u201d</p><p>Davey pushed to his feet. Almost fell right back down. A broken leg wouldn\u2019t stop a demon. The guy could still manage to get out of there.</p><p>Zane turned away from him. He tore down the hall. \u201dCatalina!\u201d With two binding marks, she\u2019d never be able to control the fire. If it came after her the way it had come after the others ...</p> <p>Burn, witch.</p><p>Her worst fear.</p><p>His feet pounded on the hard floor as he searched for her, running down that snaking hallway and following the desperate directions Davey had given him. If the kid had been lying ...</p><p>Zane turned a hard right, then slammed his foot into the third door he saw. The door shattered and flew forward and he saw Catalina on the floor. Her hands were jerking at the chains that bound two men to the wall.</p><p>She whirled toward him with a gasp, but the fear left her eyes when she saw him. \u201cZane! Help me!\u201d</p><p>The fire hadn\u2019t gotten to them yet. Smoke seeped inside the windowless room from the vents, but otherwise, they were okay. He hurried forward and grabbed the manacle on the first guy\u2019s hand. The man, blond, young, with glinting blue eyes-shit, the guy I saw when I went into Jana\u2019s mind-just shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t break \u2018em. They\u2019re reinforced, even I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zane shattered the manacle. \u201cYou can\u2019t because they\u2019re made of silver.\u201d They know your weakness. The old story about werewolves and their silver weakness was based on some fact. He broke the other manacle. The shifter stepped forward, then staggered. Long cuts and incisions covered his chest and legs. Fuck.</p><p>Catalina jumped to her feet and put her arms around him, trying to help him to balance.</p> <p>The other guy hadn\u2019t moved. His skin was gray, his dark head hung low, and the scent of blood was heavy around him.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Zane,\u201d Catalina said, \u201cthey\u2019ve bled him for days, and he hasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>The guy\u2019s head snapped up when Zane got close, and wickedly sharp fangs came at his throat. Zane caught the guy\u2019s chin in one hand and held tight. \u201cEasy.\u201d Black eyes stared back at him. Not demon eyes. The sclera was still white, but the iris had faded to pitch black. A vamp in hunting mode. No, a vamp who was starving. \u201cI\u2019m not on the menu.\u201d</p><p>The vamp snarled. Zane fired a fast glance at Catalina. \u201cWe leave this one. He\u2019s too far gone. Vamps attack anyway and he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d A desperate whisper from the vampire. \u201cWon\u2019t... bite.... Don\u2019t... leave....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe comes with us.\u201d Catalina stared at him with a raised chin. \u201cThey drained his blood for the last four days. He\u2019s starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more fucking reason to leave him here.\u201d Zane didn\u2019t ease his grip. Wasting time. Was Jana still outside? Had she already left him? \u201cA hungry vamp is a dangerous vamp.\u201d No, any vamp was a dangerous vamp. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of time. The fire\u2019s coming\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I know, but we can\u2019t leave him!\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at the vamp. At those dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t ... bite ... you....\u201c the vamp said again. His fangs were still out, his eyes still so dark. \u201c Begging ...\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cIf you do, you\u2019re dead, Drac.\u201d Simple fact. He eyed the chains holding the guy. Looked like the same kind of metal he used for his cuffs. \u201cCat, is there a little something extra on these ...?\u201d</p><p>He glanced back and saw her trembling nod.</p><p>\u201cDo you have enough magic to break it?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cI\u2019ll use everything I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>Too dangerous, she shouldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>She began to chant, low but fast, breaking the spell that had been weaved on the cuffs.</p><p>\u201cMy spell,\u201d she whispered as her shoulders sagged and her face paled and more shame flared in her eyes.</p><p>Shit. They\u2019d forced her to help keep the vamp trapped. Bastards. If this place weren\u2019t already burning to hell and back... Growling, he broke the manacles, snapping the locks and freeing the vamp.</p><p>The vampire fell forward and slammed into Zane. Zane caught him, grunting at the impact. That vamp\u2019s teeth were way too close to his throat. There was only one vamp in the world he\u2019d bleed for, and Dee wasn\u2019t anywhere near them. \u201cWatch it,\u201d he ordered, but the vamp just slumped harder against him.</p><p>He looked down. The vamp\u2019s eyes were closed. The guy was dead to the world-well, again.</p><p>Zane hefted him up and draped the vamp over his shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here, we\u2019ve got to\u2014\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Shit. He knew that they\u2019d taken too long. He turned around and found Beth in the doorway. Flames flickered behind her, bright orange and red flames.</p><p>Beth\u2019s red stare-the stare of an Ignitor charged up and burning hot-tracked across the room, landing briefly on them all, as if marking them. Maybe she was. Aim and fire. \u201cNone of you are leaving.\u201d A brief smile. \u201cNot alive, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Zane dropped the vamp to the floor and stalked forward. The guy\u2019s groan rumbled in his ears, blending with the crackle of the flames. \u201cCat, get \u2018em all out.\u201d He\u2019d take the Perseus agent on.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Catalina\u2019s scream. \u201cThere\u2019s only one door, and she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Blocking it with a wall of flames. Yeah, he saw that.</p><p>\u201cThe walls are reinforced with steel. Your witch is too weak to break out.\u201d Beth came closer. Those flames danced right along with her. \u201cThey\u2019re all too weak to do anything but die.\u201d</p><p>They might be. He wasn\u2019t. Zane sucked in a deep breath, letting his own power swell. Then, spinning away from Beth, he blasted a long, hard wave of energy at the far wall. The wall exploded, shooting outward with a scream of metal.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>The fire caught him then. A hot lick that raced up his legs and back. Instantly, he pushed down the flames but, dammit, that had hurt.</p><p>Beth\u2019s laughter filled his ears. \u201cBad mistake. You just traded your life for theirs.\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d given the bitch the perfect moment to strike. Shit. And he still had to focus his power, use his energy to protect the others, because she\u2019d let the fire loose and it was racing for Catalina. And Catalina-she stood frozen, staring at the flames with eyes too wide, terrified, as\u2014</p><p>Jana jumped through the hole he\u2019d knocked into the wall.</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d</p><p>No, shit, no! \u201cGet out!\u201d</p><p>More laughter. \u201cOh, no, she\u2019s just the one I was hoping to burn. Payback\u2019s coming,\u201d Beth said.</p><p>Jana\u2019s gaze widened. The flames were spreading too fast. Eating the floor, the walls ...</p><p>And burning like a bitch at his back.</p><p>Hold it ... control it ... He couldn\u2019t focus his attack on Beth. Not with the fire so close to the others. He pushed against the fire, but the flames kept flaring higher. Her fire\u2019s stronger than-</p><p>Jana ran for Catalina. She grabbed the witch\u2019s arm and yanked her. \u201cMove!\u201d</p><p>Catalina shook her head and finally seemed to snap back to reality. She turned and hauled ass, dragging her shifter with her.</p><p>Yes...</p><p>\u201cThe man on the floor-get him!\u201d Catalina screamed to</p><p>Jana.</p><p>Um, not a man, not really\u2014</p><p>Jana dove over the flames and grabbed the vamp\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ve got him. Zane-stop Beth! Save yourself!\u201d</p><p>She did have the vamp. She grabbed both his wrists and she started pulling him toward their new escape hole.</p><p>So Zane turned his attention back to the woman who was trying to burn him.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Beth screamed, and the fire flared higher, hotter. \u201cShe\u2019s not getting away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she is.\u201d But you\u2019re not. He could concentrate just on her now. And he knew how to stop an Ignitor.</p><p>The flames circled them, caging him and Beth together. Her eyes were so red he couldn\u2019t even see her pupils anymore. Red as fire. Her body trembled and drops of blood splattered from her nose.</p><p>\u201cYou started the fire at Night Watch, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he asked. Another Ignitor, it made sense now, it\u2014</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I paid the assholes to torch the place.\u201d Her voice rasped out. More blood flew from her nostrils, and she began to shake. \u201cMy plan, my call-and it would\u2019ve worked fucking perfectly! The FBI was going to grab Jana, more of the paranormal assholes were going to burn-killing two fucking birds!\u201d</p><p>His hands clenched. Before he ended this, he had to know ... \u201cWho is your boss? Who set this whole nightmare up?\u201d Who was behind Perseus?</p><p>She laughed at him. Laughed with madness and power echoing in the wild sound. \u201cI am Perseus. A human killing the monsters.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want a lesson in Greek myth. \u201cWho\u2019s your boss?\u201d he roared over the flames. Who\u2019d begun the chain of death? He had to know, he had to\u2014</p><p>\u201cMy game,\u201d she told him with a sick smile. \u201cWhat? Don\u2019t you think a human could do it? Don\u2019t you think a human could take down demons? Could send them to hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think ...\u201d Shit, it was hot. Sweat trickled down his face and back. \u201cHumans can be damn dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Another laugh. The fire leapt higher. \u201cYes ... we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fire is getting out of control.\u201d Wait... just wait. He had to give Jana time to clear out with the others before he struck. Perseus was about to explode.</p><p>Implode.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cScared, demon? Because you know I\u2019m stronger than you? You can\u2019t stop my fire!\u201d That circle of flames closed tighter.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not scared.\u201d He shook his head. He didn\u2019t hear Jana\u2019s footsteps anymore. Couldn\u2019t, not over the crackle and roar of the flames. \u201cBut you should be.\u201d Only one way to stop an Ignitor\u2019s fire. He sent his own fire and power plunging right at her. The blast hit Beth in the chest, and she stumbled back, screaming.</p><p>The fire went wild. Uncontrolled, for that brief moment, the circle broke and the flames licked back toward Beth, turning on her. Delicate human flesh.</p><p>Beth didn\u2019t get up.</p><p>But a scream rose above the flames. Pain filled. Afraid. Female. Not coming from inside\u2014outside. Jana.</p><p>She\u2019d gotten out, but what-who-had been waiting for her? Fuck, fuck!</p><p>Another scream broke the air. Then, \u201cNo, dammit, stop!\u201d</p><p>Zane lunged for that hole in the wall, shouting her name. The smoke and flames chased him as he burst outside.</p><p>He flew forward, sucking the fresh air into his lungs.</p><p>\u201cJana!\u201d</p><p>There. Jana was near the swamp. On the ground ... with that asshole vampire over her. His teeth in her neck. She was pounding his back, kicking, shoving, while her right hand struggled to reach a gun that was just a few feet away.</p><p>But where was her fire? Why hadn\u2019t she just burned the asshole to ash?</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck away from her!\u201d He roared.</p><p>The vamp didn\u2019t stop. Snarling, Zane lunged forward and closed the distance between them in seconds. He grabbed the vamp by his neck and hauled the bastard back.</p><p>Jana cried out, and he saw the blood dripping down her neck. Her blood.</p><p>He threw the vamp into the muddy swamp water. \u201cBaby, fuck, baby, are you okay?\u201d Her face was stark white, and she was shaking.</p><p>And crying. Jana\u2014crying?</p><p>He\u2019d kill that bastard, and he\u2019d make sure the vamp stayed dead. His fingers trembled when he touched her neck. Her blood stained his fingers.</p><p>The world went red.</p><p>Zane surged to his feet and locked his stare on the vamp. The bastard was rising from the water, his eyes open, his fangs bared.</p><p>Jana\u2019s scream. Her blood. Fucking bastard!</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Catalina flew in front of him. Zane shoved her to the side. Now wasn\u2019t the time for the witch to\u2014</p><p>She grabbed his arm and held tight. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know what he was doing, Zane! They bled him nearly dry! It was instinct. He needed to survive, he needed\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe attacked her.\u201d And where the fuck had Catalina been while the vamp shoved his teeth in Jana? Water dripped down the vamp\u2019s body as he sloshed toward the shore. His stare was still black and his fangs glinted.</p><p>Rip. Him. Apart.</p><p>Catalina\u2019s nails dug into him. \u201cPlease, Zane, he-he didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cScrew what he meant.\u201d Jana\u2019s voice. Strong. Angry. She ran up beside Zane. \u201cI\u2019m not on the damn menu.\u201d She shot the vampire, blasted him right in the chest with a bullet from the gun she held in her trembling hands.</p><p>\u201c No!\u201d Catalina screamed.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>Blood blossomed on the vamp\u2019s chest. He stared at Jana a moment, his eyes flickering between blue and black, and he whispered, \u201cS-sorry ...\u201d right before he toppled back into the water.</p><p>Catalina ran after him, chanting, whispering her spells- they wouldn\u2019t do much good. Not with her being so weak. And if that vamp rose again ...</p> <p>He\u2019s mine.</p><p>Jana\u2019s hand was shaking so much. Damn blood loss. Zane caught her hand and took the gun.</p><p>An explosion rocked the ground. Jana slipped, tumbling to her knees. Zane glanced over his shoulder. The Perseus buildings had just blown to hell and back. Guards were running, screaming, and that fire was blasting out of control as\u2014</p><p>Fuck me. Beth was running out of the building. The flames were chasing after her, and she was headed right for him.</p><p>He grabbed Jana, pulling her to her feet. He\u2019d protect her, make sure that\u2014</p><p>Those flames raced toward them. Beth shrieked, \u201cI can\u2019t stop it! Help! Make it stop! Make it\u2014\u201d</p> <p>This time, Zane was the one who fired. His finger squeezed the trigger and the bullet thudded into Beth\u2019s heart. She gasped, shuddered, then pitched back on the ground.</p><p>The flames sputtered, then began to die, burning down slowly.</p><p>\u201cI made it stop,\u201d he said quietly, staring at her prone body. He\u2019d made it stop, the only way he could. His left arm wrapped around Jana and held her tight.</p><p>\u201cZ-Zane...\u201d</p><p>His head tilted down toward hers.</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t supposed to happen,\u201d she whispered, and she blinked away the tears in her eyes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t ...\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. Because right then, he damn well had to. Vamp attacked her. Could have lost her. In the end, despite their powers, Ignitors were only human. Unlike the vamp asshole, an Ignitor couldn\u2019t take a bullet and rise again.</p><p>So easy to kill. Too easy.</p> <p>His lips brushed against hers. Light at first because shit, she was delicate. So fragile. But her hands rose and sank into his hair and she arched up against him, kissing him harder, pressing her mouth tightly to his.</p><p>Zane\u2019s tongue thrust into her mouth. His hold was too hard. He knew it, but he couldn\u2019t manage to ease his grip. Can\u2019t let her go.</p><p>The world fell down around them, but he held her close and wondered how in the hell she\u2019d come to mean so much to him. So much that he was ready to kill for her.</p><p>\u201c Zane!\u201d The shout broke through the chaos, but he didn\u2019t let Jana go. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cZane, fuck!\u201d Footsteps thudded toward him. \u201cI come to save your ass and find you gettin\u2019 ass!\u201d</p><p>Jude. Perfect timing, as always. Slowly, Zane lifted his head. His gaze craned to the right and met the shifter\u2019s. \u201cArriving late to the party?\u201d</p><p>Jude whistled as he took in the scene before him. \u201cWhat the hell did you do?\u201d The question wasn\u2019t for Zane, though. No, when he asked, his stare locked on Jana.</p><p>Tony ran up behind them. \u201cFire trucks are coming but- shit, Catalina? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said,\u201d Zane murmured, \u201ca party.\u201d A death party.</p><p>Jana stiffened against him. \u201cThe cop?\u201d Her whisper. She shoved against Zane, and he let her go, only because he knew there was a hell of a lot to work out. Sirens blasted in the distance. The fire trucks. Probably police cars, too.</p><p>Zane exhaled heavily. \u201cYou sure took your sweet time tracking me.\u201d Jude was usually a much better tracker. He\u2019d thought his friend would arrive sooner. Before the fire and screams.</p><p>Tony rushed toward Catalina. She had one arm around the vamp, and she was struggling to pull him out of the water.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to him?\u201d Tony demanded.</p><p>Catalina\u2019s green eyes darted to Jana.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Jana said, squaring her shoulders and stepping even farther away from Zane. What was up with that?</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes slit when Tony offered a hand to the vamp. \u201cWatch it, Tony.\u201d The cop would need the warning. \u201cThe asshole with Cat bites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d From Jude. Yeah, the shifter understood-he would have caught the vamp\u2019s scent.</p><p>Instead of reaching for the vamp, Tony drew his weapon and leveled it at the guy. \u201cMy bullets are laced with holy water. Make one move at me, come at me with those teeth, and the first bullet goes between your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Tony always believed in being prepared. Smart guy.</p><p>Jana slipped back a few more steps.</p><p>Fire trucks and police cruisers flew onto the scene. The low flames flickered, and the smoke billowed. Then the uniforms burst out of their cars. Hell. Showtime.</p><p>Her neck burned. It ached and throbbed and burned. What the hell? You try to do something nice for someone, like oh, drag a guy\u2019s butt out of the fire, and as payment, he bites you. Did she look like a freaking buffet?</p><p>As the cops swarmed the scene, Jana eased deeper into the darkness. The firefighters were blasting the remaining flames with hoses from their trucks. Not that there was much point in fighting the fire now. Those flames were dying on their own. Without the Ignitor to fuel the fire, they would sputter out.</p><p>The Ignitor.</p><p>Jana cast a fast glance at Beth\u2019s body. Beth had lost control at the end. The fire had been too new to her. She hadn\u2019t been able to control the flames.</p><p>Because those flames were mine. The power was mine.</p><p>But Beth had taken the flames from her. And now-now she was just ... human.</p><p>A human with a lot of blood on her hands and too many cops close by.</p><p>The butt of the gun pressed against her lower back. She\u2019d taken it from Zane, stolen it right out of his hand while he\u2019d kissed her.</p><p>I can still taste him. I still want him.</p><p>But Zane was about twenty feet away now and talking to that woman. The one with the pale blond hair. The one who touched him too much. The chick who\u2019d saved the vamp. Zane hadn\u2019t attacked the vampire. He\u2019d frozen, because of the blonde. Catalina. The witch. She\u2019d heard the woman chanting when they came outside, and she\u2019d felt the wind ripple around her in response to those words. Yeah, the blonde was a witch, though she seemed to be pretty weak in terms of power.</p><p>Beth had been right after all. There had been someone in the Perseus compound that Zane cared for. His weakness.</p><p>But Perseus was dead. Gutted. The guards and agents who\u2019d survived the flames had fled into the swamp. The cops would search for them. If they didn\u2019t find them, Night Watch would. She didn\u2019t know what kind of bullshit explanation Zane was giving to the cops then, but it was obvious from their expressions that he had the guys eating out of his hands. The fact that he had a cop at his side-that Tony guy from Baton Rouge-probably just made his story all the more believable.</p><p>Yeah, the cops were on Zane\u2019s side, but when the smoke cleared, they wouldn\u2019t be on her side. No, she was still a wanted woman. They\u2019d come after her, and she didn\u2019t particularly like the thought of spending any more years locked away from the world.</p><p>She stared at Zane. Watched him gesture to Beth\u2019s body. Jana swallowed. Time was running out. She needed to leave but ...</p><p>Zane.</p><p>His gaze cut to hers. His eyes glinted, reflecting the fire. His face was hard, tight, and her breath shuddered out as she stared at him.</p><p>She\u2019d gone back into the fire for him. Did he know that?</p><p>Did he\u2014</p><p>Zane turned away and started walking toward the back of an ambulance. Catalina was with him.... so was the vamp. He turned away.</p><p>Jana kept her shoulders up. She blinked. Once. Twice. Swallowed. They\u2019d had a deal. She\u2019d given Zane what he wanted-Perseus. Justice for the hunters who\u2019d died in the fire.</p><p>Now the deal was over.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d A cop approached her with his brows drawn low. \u201cMiss, we\u2019re gonna need to ask you a few questions.\u201d</p><p>Questions that she couldn\u2019t answer. Hi. I\u2019m Jana Carter. If you check, you\u2019ll see that I\u2019m wanted in connection with a series of arsons. What? Oh, yeah, the fire tonight was arson, too. It looks like my M.O.? Really... um, look, why don\u2019t you just shove me in jail forever?</p><p>She stared at the cop and shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to you.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cMiss?\u201d He was a harmless looking fellow. Big, brown eyes. Pale cheeks. A bit of a receding hairline. Well, he appeared harmless ... except for the badge and the gun he carried.</p><p>How could she get away from him? Without, of course, assaulting him. Don\u2019t want to add assaulting an officer to my rap sheet.</p><p>But then he gasped and those puppy dog eyes widened. \u201cUh, are you okay?\u201d she asked. He fell to the ground.</p><p>Jana jumped back. Her heart slammed into her chest. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d She found herself staring into eyes that she\u2019d never forgotten. Bright blue eyes that seemed to shine. No, that did shine-with the light of the beast. Shifter. The wolf she\u2019d been ordered to kill.</p><p>\u201cYou planning to stand there all night?\u201d he demanded, and she saw that he was sweating. In the chilled air, he was sweating. And shaking. \u201cOr do you have a plan to get out of here?\u201d</p><p>Once more, she looked at Zane and only saw his back. The wolf closed in on her, and Jana knew what choice she had to make.</p><p>Survival. That\u2019s what life was all about, right?</p><p>Good-bye, Zane.</p><p>The EMT was a demon. Low level. Zane took one look at the guy and saw right through the glamour. \u201cWe got a vamp here,\u201d he murmured to the EMT as he steered the guy and Catalina toward the ambulance. Catalina wasn\u2019t releasing her hold on the vampire-probably because she knew just how much Zane wanted to rip the bastard apart.</p><p>Can\u2019t. Not with all the humans there ...</p><p>\u201cGet him out of here,\u201d Zane told the EMT. \u201cBefore he starts gnawing on the humans or before I have to cut his damn head off.\u201d</p><p>The EMT\u2019s eyes bulged, but he nodded quickly.</p><p>Zane glared down at Catalina. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing with him.\u201d</p><p>The vamp was weaving on his feet. He slumped forward and fell into the ambulance. The demon EMT grabbed him and shoved him onto a gurney. Then he strapped the vamp down, nice and tight.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t meant to hurt her,\u201d Catalina said. Finally, she wasn\u2019t touching the vamp. \u201cHe was starving, desperate....\u201d</p><p>No fucking excuse. Zane leaned into the ambulance. \u201cHey, asshole ...\u201d</p><p>The vamp\u2019s eyelids flickered.</p><p>\u201cYou and me are gonna be meeting up again.\u201d Once this mess with Perseus was cleaned up. \u201cI\u2019ll find you,\u201d he promised the vamp. \u201cCount on it.\u201d Because he wasn\u2019t getting away with attacking Jana.</p><p>The sirens screamed on. Catalina jumped into the ambulance. She bit her lip and stared down at him. \u201cZane ...\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the door and slammed it shut. He didn\u2019t trust himself to talk to her then. Not with the scent of Jana\u2019s blood still on that vamp.</p><p>He spun away and marched back toward Tony. Covering up an Other event with a dozen humans wasn\u2019t easy. He\u2019d been forced to break his normal rule about not slipping into a human\u2019s mind without permission. Because, yeah, some of the cops and firefighters had seen things they shouldn\u2019t have. He\u2019d needed to blur their memories.</p><p>Behind Tony, a team tagged and bagged Beth\u2019s body. \u201cWhere\u2019s the gun?\u201d Tony whispered.</p><p>Zane blinked. Hell, he\u2019d forgotten all about that. He\u2019d kissed Jana and\u2014\u201cJana took it.\u201d Not that he blamed her. Not one bit. After the vamp\u2019s attack, she\u2019d want to protect herself.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna need it.\u201d Tony sighed and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cThis shit is gonna hit the fan, and we\u2019ll need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t need anything, son.\u201d A man walked up to them. He strolled right through the smoke. He had on brown pants, a loose white shirt, and a badge. He inclined his head toward them, and when he flashed a smile, his white teeth looked a little too sharp. \u201cI\u2019m Chief Jeremiah Daniels.\u201d He paused. \u201cAnd I understand you took down some of the bastards who\u2019ve been targeting us.\u201d The South rolled, nice and heavy, in his drawl.</p><p>Us.</p><p>The chief\u2019s dark skin was unlined. Daniels could have been fifty or thirty. One thing for sure, he wasn\u2019t human. Behind him, more cops piled out of new vehicles. \u201cMy men,\u201d Jeremiah said with a nod. \u201cMy ... uh, special unit.\u201d A grim nod. \u201cThey\u2019ll know how to handle the agents still alive.\u201d And the human cops began to be pushed back by the new arrivals.</p><p>Zane studied the chief. \u201cIf you knew about Perseus, why the hell didn\u2019t you take \u2018em down?\u201d</p><p>That wide smile flashed again. \u201cBecause you beat me to the punch, son.\u201d</p><p>Right.</p><p>\u201cPak called me. Told me you boys would need some help cleaning up.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI got this scene.\u201d Good.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m going to need the Ignitor,\u201d Daniels said, and Zane stiffened.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you are. Jana didn\u2019t do this! It was the other one\u2014\u201d</p><p>Daniels watched him with narrowed eyes. \u201cOther one?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane jerked his thumb toward the body bag. \u201cThat\u2019s the Ignitor who started the blaze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo Ignitors?\u201d Tony whistled. \u201cMan, talk about playing with fire.\u201d</p><p>But the chief didn\u2019t look at Beth\u2019s body. \u201cI knew Beth Parker. She was a low-level psychic, but she was no Ignitor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why were her eyes burning red as the flames ripped through the place?\u201d Zane asked, voice tight. \u201cI know what I saw, and I\u2019m telling you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only Ignitor is Jana Carter,\u201d Jeremiah said flatly. \u201cI got my own psychics on the team, and when an Ignitor is in the area, I know.\u201d</p><p>No, the guy was wrong.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to Ms. Carter. And I need to have that little chat with her before the suits from the FBI get here.\u201d The extermination list.</p><p>Daniels nodded. \u201cNow you\u2019re understanding, demon. We don\u2019t have much time. Where is she?\u201d</p> <p>Zane glanced back at the trees. Jana had been there moments before, watching him. He\u2019d been leading that vamp bastard to the ambulance, determined to keep the guy away from Jana. But now ...</p><p>Now the spot was empty. No, not empty. A cop was on the ground. On his knees, rising slowly.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d The curse was Tony\u2019s, but they both took off running at the same time. Zane reached the cop first. He caught the guy\u2019s arm and hauled him the rest of the way off the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>The cop blinked. \u201cWh-who?\u201d He rubbed the back of his head. \u201cWh-what hit me?\u201d Not what. Who.</p><p>Tony huffed out a breath. \u201cWasn\u2019t there a pickup truck parked over there\u201d-he pointed to an empty space near some twisting pines\u2014\u201ca few minutes ago?\u201d</p> <p>Zane\u2019s hold on the cop tightened. \u201cYou were talking to a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was?\u201d</p><p>Hell.</p><p>The cop\u2019s eyes widened. \u201dI was. Y-yeah ... I-I wanted to ask her some questions.\u201d He shook his head and winced. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>That was the question Zane wanted answered. He caught the whiff of blood and knew that someone had hit the cop.</p><p>\u201cUh ... Zane?\u201d Tony tapped him on the arm.</p><p>Jaw clenched, he let the cop go. The guy scrambled back but eyed him with a frightened stare.</p><p>\u201cHollis, get over here!\u201d the chief called out. Officer Hollis rushed to obey, even as he still rubbed the back of his head.</p> <p>Tony leaned in close. \u201cWhere\u2019s the shifter?\u201d</p><p>With his strong nose, Jude was helping the cops search for the dead. \u201cJude\u2019s with the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot him.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Tony.</p><p>\u201cThe bastard I saw running away from Catalina when I got here. It looked like he was coming to help her and the vamp, but when he saw me and Jude, the guy turned tail and ran.\u201d</p><p>Turned tail? Nice.</p><p>\u201cI saw his fangs and his claws. I know he was a shifter.\u201d He was. Now they were missing a shifter-a shifter who just might have a score to settle with Jana.</p><p>\u201cWe found the truck,\u201d Chief Daniels told him an hour later as he crossed his arms over his wide chest. They were back in the city, at the police department, and Zane\u2019s whole body tightened with tension.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, son.\u201d Daniels shook his head. \u201cI said we found the truck. Not her.\u201d He paused. \u201cSomething you need to know ... there was blood in the truck.\u201d</p><p>The world seemed to narrow then.</p><p>\u201cThe girl was gone, but one of my cops\u2014\u201d Daniels leaned in close. \u201cOfficer Wiley... he\u2019s got a good nose on him.\u201d Right. Because he was probably a shifter. \u201cAnd he said he smelled wolf all over that damn pickup.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s back teeth clenched. \u201cGet an APB out. The wolf is about six-foot-one, maybe one-eighty, blond hair, blue eyes.\u201d Sharp teeth.</p><p>\u201cI already got an APB out on your girl,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure the uniforms know to look for him, too.\u201d</p><p>But they\u2019d already ditched the pickup. Hell, now they could grab any vehicle, any time.</p><p>\u201cI figured she\u2019d just run.\u201d Daniels sighed. \u201cUntil I found out about the blood. Now I\u2019m not so sure she went willingly.\u201d</p><p>They were alone in the chief\u2019s office. A small office, and one with a really crappy view. Zane forced his hands to unclench. \u201cThe vamp bit her back at the swamp. The blood could have come from that bite.\u201d Could have. But if that shifter had gotten her ...</p><p>Should have left his ass chained to the wall.</p><p>A knock rapped at the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Daniels barked.</p><p>The door opened, and Tony poked his head in. \u201cWe\u2019ve got company.\u201d Company that had made his whole face harden.</p><p>\u201cTell \u2018em to take a fuckin\u2019 number!\u201d Daniels bellowed. \u201cI\u2019ve got a missing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA missing what?\u201d A female voice asked.</p><p>The chief froze, then grunted out, \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Daniels might be surprised, but Zane had caught the woman\u2019s scent, so when the door swung open fully and Special Agent Kelly Thomas appeared next to Tony, he wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>But he was annoyed.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she, demon?\u201d Agent Thomas asked, staring at him. \u201cI heard the call on the police scanner. I know about the fire out in the swamp.\u201d She walked into the room, her heels clicking. Tony, his mouth tight, shut the door behind her. \u201cAnd I know an Ignitor set that fire.\u201d</p><p>Zane rolled his shoulders. Jana, where are you? \u201cYou\u2019re right. An Ignitor did set the fire.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou admit she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth Parker started the fire. I can testify to that. So can two other witnesses.\u201d He\u2019d make sure Catalina didn\u2019t disappear before backing up his story, and he\u2019d also be sure not to kill the vamp until that guy could back up his claim, too.</p><p>The special agent\u2019s teeth snapped together and she gritted out, \u201cAnother one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can dig up other witnesses who will testify that Beth Parker started numerous fires in the area.\u201d He was bullshitting now, but screw that. Jana wasn\u2019t being exterminated. \u201cParker was the Ignitor, not Jana Carter.\u201d</p><p>The silence in the room was so thick he could feel it weighing on him.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s cheeks flushed a dark, violent red. \u201cJana Carter is a killer.\u201d</p><p>Maybe, but they weren\u2019t killing her. \u201cI\u2019ve already talked to Pak. He\u2019s calling his contacts at the FBI and clearing this mess up. You\u2019ve been after the wrong woman, Special Agent.\u201d</p><p>If looks could kill ... \u201cThe hell I have been.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders. \u201cJana Carter isn\u2019t your prey anymore.\u201d The chief wasn\u2019t saying anything. Surprising, but good. The guy was going along with his story.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is.\u201d And her stare touched on the chief. \u201cYou backing him?\u201d</p><p>Jeremiah\u2019s bushy brows climbed. \u201cThe evidence indicates that Beth Parker was the one who started\u2014\u201d \u201dGive me Jana Carter.\u201d</p><p>Zane leaned forward and quietly said, \u201cNot going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened as she stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re in the middle of a federal investigation. I could have you arrested for obstruction, and don\u2019t think you\u2019re just walking away after that crap you pulled in Baton Rouge\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pulled a gun on me, lady. I was just defending myself.\u201d And he\u2019d do it again. Real soon, if she didn\u2019t back off.</p><p>Tony stepped between him and the agent. \u201cJana Carter isn\u2019t here.\u201d Ah, a calm voice. \u201cWe have no idea where she is.\u201d</p><p>That was the absolute truth.</p><p>\u201cShe was with him.\u201d Kelly pointed her finger at Zane. \u201cThey traveled down here together. My sources say they stole a Ford and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sources?\u201d Zane asked, curious. She knew the make of the car they\u2019d used. Sonofabitch. Perseus hadn\u2019t come after them-she had. \u201cWould those sources be the assholes you sent to run our car off the road?\u201d</p><p>Kelly didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Tony swore.</p><p>Her back straightened. \u201cJana Carter is a fugitive, she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGonna be cleared by the FBI any damn minute,\u201d Zane promised. Pak had pull. Zane would be covered for his ... incident in Baton Rouge.</p><p>And Jana had better be cleared, too. He sauntered around Tony. \u201cI\u2019m afraid your job\u2019s over here, Ms. Thomas. Pack it in. You\u2019re not after Jana anymore.\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t backing down and he could see the calculation in her gaze. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know where she is.\u201d A hard laugh filled the tight room. \u201cDid she fuck you over, too? She screwed you, left you, and you\u2019re still idiot enough to try and protect her?\u201d</p><p>He glared back at her. \u201cStay away from Jana.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m doing my job. My job is to find her, to stop her-by any means necessary.\u201d Her gaze could have singed him. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? That was your job, too. Before you decided to have sex with a killer.\u201d</p><p>Kelly spun away and stormed for the door. \u201cI\u2019m finding her, and I\u2019m doing my job.\u201d Her fingers curled over the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cHe was your stepbrother,\u201d Tony said. Zane blinked. Uh, what?</p><p>\u201cBrent Martin, one of the two doctors killed in that fire a few months back. The fire you think Jana started in that lab.\u201d</p><p>Her spine was flagpole straight. \u201cI don\u2019t think it. I know she started that fire. I know she killed him.\u201d</p><p>Tony whistled. \u201cThis thing has been personal for you from the beginning. It\u2019s not about doing your job. It\u2019s about getting some kind of revenge.\u201d</p><p>She threw a fuming gaze back at them. \u201cJana Carter killed two innocent men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInnocent my ass,\u201d Zane muttered. \u201cLady, you don\u2019t know what the hell has been going on down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrent was researching paranormals\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was slicing them into little pieces to see what made them tick,\u201d Zane told her bluntly. \u201cAnd guess what? Some of those paranormals didn\u2019t like getting cut up. Some of them fought back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your Jana?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t touching that. So he said, \u201cHe was working for Project Perseus, a bunch of bastards that couldn\u2019t be trusted. You\u2019re FBI. Start digging. Check \u2018em out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already knows about them,\u201d Tony said quietly. \u201cFrom my intel, the FBI had been trying to get someone inside Perseus for months.\u201d A pause. \u201cWas your stepbrother an agent? Was he working both sides?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she snapped. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know what was happening. He was just trying to help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Jana\u2019s memories burned through Zane\u2019s mind. \u201cHe knew what he was doing. He knew he was hurting them, and he didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about, you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvestigate him,\u201d Zane said. Simple. \u201cFind out for yourself.\u201d But he could tell by the expression on her face that Agent Kelly Thomas had already made up her mind.</p><p>The only thing she planned to do was hunt. And, as the door slammed shut behind her, he realized he had to find Jana before she did because the FBI agent didn\u2019t seem to care about orders.</p><p>Just revenge.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think your girl is the cold-blooded killer Agent Thomas believes she is,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>Zane forced his teeth to unclench. \u201cShe\u2019s not.\u201d Dead certainty.</p><p>\u201cUm ... tell me ... have you wondered how Jude and I came to find you? How the cavalry\u201d-he inclined his head toward Daniels\u2014\u201cknew where we all were?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d just figured that Tony and Jude had tracked him. When it came to tracking, Jude was the best.</p><p>\u201cWe found you because Jana called Pak. She told him where you were, and she told him to haul ass and get help out there.\u201d</p><p>Then she\u2019d come back into the fire and tried to pull him out herself.</p><p>Where are you? The question was burning him alive. \u201cWe have to find her.\u201d Before Agent Thomas did.</p><p>Two nights later, Zane stood on the doorstep of his house, the night air crisp around him and worry a cold, hard weight in his chest.</p><p>The New Orleans cops hadn\u2019t been able to find Jana. Jude hadn\u2019t been able to track her. He hadn\u2019t been able to find her.</p><p>The woman had vanished, and he was scared as all hell.</p><p>What if Daniels was right and she hadn\u2019t disappeared willingly? What if that shifter had taken her? Agent Thomas might not be the only one jonesing for revenge.</p><p>The cops had rounded up over twenty guards and agents from Perseus. Davey had gotten away. Maybe, just maybe that kid would be smart enough to start fresh somewhere- and to choose fucking sides better next time.</p><p>Perseus was dead. Jana should have been safe from them. So where the hell are you, baby?</p><p>He shoved the key into the lock. Tomorrow, he\u2019d use every resource Night Watch had to break apart the Other world. He\u2019d already been up nearly forty-eight hours straight, only catching a few hours\u2019 worth of sleep, as he searched for Jana. It had taken the cops a day to realize she\u2019d left the city. A whole wasted day. Should have known that right away.</p><p>He kicked the door shut behind him and shoved the dead bolt home. He had to find Jana before the FBI did.</p><p>Pak had told them to call off the dogs, but he knew the order wasn\u2019t going to stop Thomas. That woman was gunning for Jana\u2019s blood.</p><p>Jana.</p><p>The last time he\u2019d seen her, she\u2019d been standing under that willow tree. Blood had trickled down her throat. She\u2019d been too pale. Her eyes too wide. He\u2019d wanted to run to her, but he\u2019d needed to get rid of that dick vampire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He dropped his bag. His eyes were grainy, and he was in serious need of a shower. Zane couldn\u2019t remember the last meal he\u2019d eaten and\u2014</p><p>Not alone.</p><p>The awareness seeped into his pores. He hadn\u2019t bothered to turn on the lights. No need. His vision was almost as good as a shifter\u2019s in the dark. His sense of smell was almost human, but his vision was far superior. He let his gaze sweep to the left. To the right.</p> <p>Then up, to the second story. His bedroom. The faintest of creaks reached his ears. Someone was up there.</p><p>Someone had picked the wrong demon to screw with.</p><p>He took the steps three at a time. Moving fast, but not making a sound. The bedroom door was open, just as he\u2019d left it days before. The bedcovers were wrecked. He could see the mess through the door. Not the way he\u2019d left the place. He caught the movement of a shadow. His uninvited guest.</p><p>Mouth tight, he launched through the door and attacked.</p><p>Their bodies collided and the intruder stumbled back. He followed, going in for the kill and\u2014</p> <p>And her breath feathered over his cheek. Her scent-wild, sexy-filled his nostrils and he knew, he knew even before he saw the wild curtain of black hair that his intruder was Jana.</p><p>He caught her before she could hit the floor. He yanked her up close, held her tight, then they fell together onto the bed.</p><p>His mouth took hers. Had to. His tongue thrust past her lips and drove deep into that sweetness that he\u2019d missed. Her body was soft beneath his, but her fingers were strong on his shoulders. Her legs had spread, and he thrust against her, shoving his jeans-clad legs between her thighs.</p><p>She tore her mouth from his. \u201cYou\u2019d better know who the hell I am.\u201d Anger there.</p><p>And he realized that, to her, it was pitch black in the room. \u201cBaby, trust me, there\u2019s no forgetting you.\u201d The anger was there, boiling just beneath the surface for him because she\u2019d scared him. \u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers dug into his shoulders. Growling, he grabbed her hands and pinned them against the mattress. \u201cJana ... why did you run? Where did you go?\u201d Why did you leave me?</p> <p>\u201cI came here.\u201d Her breath feathered against him. \u201cTo you. I thought ... I thought I\u2019d be safe here.\u201d</p><p>The rage left him at those simple words.</p><p>\u201cYou were safe with me in New Orleans.\u201d He kissed her again. His tongue swiped over her lips. Into her mouth. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have left,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDo you know how fucking crazy I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cops were there.\u201d Her voice was just as soft as his had been. Hushed in the darkness. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let them take me in. I-I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to jail.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t let it happen.</p><p>\u201cZane, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d He kissed her once more even as his hands went to the snap of her jeans. They\u2019d talk more. He\u2019d tell her about Beth and the cops and the plan he\u2019d already set into motion but for now-now if he didn\u2019t have her soon, his control would shatter.</p><p>He unsnapped the jeans and jerked down her zipper. Why couldn\u2019t he get enough of her? Why was he so desperate for her?</p> <p>Jana\u2019s hands were on him now, moving just as greedily as his own. She shoved up his shirt, and her nails scored his flesh.</p><p>He heard the thud of her shoes as they hit the floor. His followed right behind \u2018em. She lifted her hips, and he yanked the jeans down her legs. The scrap of lace-sexy panties- disappeared with them.</p><p>His fingers pushed between her folds. Found her warm. So warm. He eased his finger inside her and she was fucking tight. Her cream began to coat him as he stroked her, getting her ready, because she had to want him as much as he wanted her.</p><p>Her hands pushed between them. Then she was the one yanking at the button of his jeans and pulling down the zipper.</p><p>When she tried to touch his cock, Zane stopped her. \u201cCan\u2019t ... baby ... too close.\u201d Because he was about to explode. He shoved off the bed. Zane grabbed the condoms out of his nightstand and went back to her.</p><p>She stripped off her shirt, but kept on a black bra that cupped her breasts so well. Her dark hair spread out on the pillow behind her. His fallen angel.</p><p>He sheathed his cock, rolling the condom quickly into place. He caught her ankle and pulled her toward the edge of the bed. Zane leaned over her, and took another taste. His mouth pressed against her sex, his tongue licked over the tight button of her need, and he tasted that rich cream and that sweet flesh.</p><p>She shuddered against him, a ripple that he felt right at his mouth. His tongue pushed into her.</p><p>\u201cZane...\u201d</p><p>His fingers worked her even as his mouth took and took. Not enough. Not even close. Not\u2014</p><p>She jerked against him, coming on a long rush as she gasped his name.</p><p>Fucking perfect.</p><p>He pulled back and positioned his cock at the wet entrance of her sex, then he drove deep in one long, hard thrust.</p><p>Her eyes were wide open. On him. The contractions from her climax squeezed his cock. So damn good.</p><p>He withdrew, then plunged back into her. Jana locked her legs around him and held tight. Not soft. Not easy. Not this time.</p><p>Too desperate. Too much fear and worry inside, too much lust.</p><p>His thrusts were fast and frantic as he pounded into her, and she met him, arching and driving right back at him. Her breath panted. His heartbeat thundered in his ears. Faster. Faster.</p><p>When she tensed beneath him, he knew another climax was close. He kissed her, thrusting his tongue into her mouth just as her orgasm hit.</p><p>Holy fuck.</p><p>His spine tightened. He plunged into her. Again. Again. His fingers bit into her hips. The bed squeaked. Sweat slickened his body.</p><p>So wet and tight and so\u2014</p><p>Jana.</p><p>He erupted into her, coming on a blast of pleasure that burned through him, singeing his flesh and leaving him hollowed out, weak ... and wanting more. Of her-always more.</p><p>Special Agent Kelly Thomas stared up at the darkened house on Louis Avenue. She\u2019d known that Zane Wynter would be coming home sooner or later, so she\u2019d just waited for him. No need to follow the man around the state, not when she knew where he was heading.</p><p>Home.</p><p>Zane was her key. She knew it. The man was a fine hunter, one of the best. All the Night Watch hunters had solid-and dangerous-reputations when it came to tracking and apprehending their prey. Hell, that was why the FBI contracted out with them so much. Why should the agents get their hands dirty when Night Watch could handle the blood so much easier? She\u2019d thought this case would be handled fast by Night Watch, by Zane. Guess I thought wrong.</p><p>Zane knew how to take down Ignitors. He didn\u2019t let their humanity stop him. He killed them, end of story.</p><p>Or, that had been the end, until Jana Carter came along.</p><p>Back in New Orleans, she\u2019d seen the way Zane\u2019s face hardened when he talked about her. Seen the slight widening of his nostrils, the lock of his fists. He\u2019d been worried about the woman. Worried about a cold-blooded killer.</p><p>Men always let their dicks confuse them. Give \u2018em a good ride, and they\u2019d forget every moral they\u2019d ever had.</p><p>Looked like the hunter had fallen for his prey. Pity. Would he wise up in time? Would he realize she was just using him? Probably not. Most men were too stupid to see what was right in front of them.</p><p>Brent hadn\u2019t been like that. He\u2019d been a nice guy, sweet, always ready to lend a hand, and always happy to make room for a stepsister who hadn\u2019t felt like she ever really belonged anywhere.</p><p>He\u2019d been there for her, the first person in her whole life who cared, and now, she\u2019d be there for him in death. She wasn\u2019t letting his killer walk away. No way did she buy that bullshit story about Beth Parker being an Ignitor. The FBI had a file on Parker. The woman was a psychic, one who\u2019d worked with Perseus for too many years, but she wasn\u2019t an Ignitor.</p><p>Hell, she\u2019d even gotten that info backed up by a demon who\u2019d escaped the fires at Perseus. The guy had found Kelly at her cheap hotel room. He\u2019d been trembling, scared, and he\u2019d told her that she needed to keep watching Jana.</p><p>Jana. That woman was the killer. Jana was the one who would pay for her crime. And Jana was the one she would catch.</p><p>Her eyes never left that darkened house. Zane was the key. He wasn\u2019t just going to let Jana walk away; she\u2019d seen that in his eyes, too. He wouldn\u2019t stop until he\u2019d found his little firestarter.</p><p>No sense racing against him and trying to find Jana first. No sense in that at all.</p><p>She just needed to step back and watch him. Sooner or later-and Kelly was betting on the sooner part-Zane would lead her right to Jana.</p><p>Her gun was a solid weight in her holster. When she found the Ignitor, she wouldn\u2019t shoot tranquilizers at her anymore. Time for this hunt to end.</p><p>Time for Brent\u2019s justice.</p><p>Jana\u2019s heartbeat shook her chest. Her body still trembled with aftershocks of pleasure and Zane-he was all over her. Covering her, still in her.</p><p>She never wanted him to move.</p><p>Biting her lip, Jana let her hands curl over his shoulders. She\u2019d been afraid to come to his place. Not sure if he\u2019d want to see her, but also sure that she couldn\u2019t just walk away from him. She\u2019d walked away from everything and everyone else in her life, but she hadn\u2019t been able to turn away from him.</p><p>Zane\u2019s dark head lifted and she wished that she could see him as well in the dark as he seemed to see her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crying,\u201d he told her and, shocked, she realized he was right.</p><p>His fingers smoothed over her cheeks and he brushed the tear drops away.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ...\u201d Run anymore. Spend my days looking over my shoulder, always wondering when the cops will come. \u201cI know I\u2019m on the extermination list, and I shouldn\u2019t be here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting your name off the list.\u201d</p><p>A shocked laugh broke from her lips. \u201cSure you are.\u201d His fingers were warm and a little rough on her skin. But then, her demon was a little rough. \u201cEven you don\u2019t have that kind of power, Zane.\u201d That meant she wouldn\u2019t have much time with him, but she\u2019d take what she could get.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you left me in that swamp? You were afraid of being taken in?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and knew that it would be twisted with sadness. \u201cI\u2019m a wanted woman.\u201d A woman who\u2019d finally found something she wanted. \u201cMe and the cops don\u2019t mix so well.\u201d Never had.</p><p>He stared down at her, saying nothing. Then, he pulled away from her. His flesh slid slowly out of her body, and she ached at the loss.</p><p>He rose and disappeared into the bathroom. A few moments later, he came back. He stood next to the bed, staring down at her. Jana gazed back at him, seeing a dark, looming shadow and feeling ... vulnerable with her jeans gone, just clad in the bra. She reached for the covers and yanked them over her body.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come to me?\u201d he demanded in a voice gravel rough.</p><p>Ah, the million-dollar question. Because I wanted you. Because I knew you\u2019d keep me safe. Because you\u2019re the most dangerous badass demon I know and I need you. Because...</p><p>No, no, she wouldn\u2019t even go there in her own thoughts. She sat up and tugged the covers with her. \u201cYou and I had an agreement.\u201d</p><p>He waited, a dark shadow.</p><p>\u201cSomething ... something happened to me in that swamp.\u201d Said in a rush.</p><p>His fingers brushed her cheek and, slowly, his hand slipped down to her neck, to the skin that still ached. In the light, she had a lovely yellow-and-black bruise. She wasn\u2019t sure how strong his vision was, and she hoped he couldn\u2019t see it, or the tremble that slipped over her at his touch.</p><p>\u201cI should have staked that bastard.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and remembered the raw flash of fear that had pierced her when the vamp had locked his teeth on her. She hadn\u2019t been helpless in so long, but in that moment ...</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect him to attack.\u201d That had been her mistake. Any vamp was a dangerous vamp-she knew that. But in the flames and the fury and her fear for Zane, she\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>\u201cCatalina.\u201c</p><p>Jana blinked.</p><p>\u201cThe witch told me to save him ... and that shifter.\u201d</p><p>Jana stiffened a bit. \u201cShe\u2019s the friend you had inside Perseus.\u201d That made her worried. Very, very worried.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t there by choice. They were binding her.\u201d</p><p>Her breath left in a rush. She\u2019d heard of witches being bound before. Their powers were slowly stolen from them. Three binding marks ... then a witch was helpless. Almost ... human.</p><p>Join the club.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed close.\u201d Okay, crap, she couldn\u2019t keep the jealousy out of her voice. \u201cWe were.\u201d</p><p>Were was nice and past tense, but it also sure implied that a whole lot could have gone on between him and the witch. \u201cYou went back in to save her.\u201d That point had stuck with her. He\u2019d braved the fire for the witch.</p><p>\u201cCatalina almost burned once before.\u201d</p><p>Something clicked then. \u201cThe other Ignitor ...\u201d The one he\u2019d killed. \u201cDid she...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe started the fire that went after Cat, yeah.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d killed to protect the witch. Then he\u2019d been willing to fight the flames for her again in that swamp. Jealousy tasted like acid on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cI went back for her.\u201d He paused. \u201cAnd you came back for me.\u201d</p><p>Jana licked her lips, and her fingers curled tighter around the covers. \u201cI-I had to make certain you were okay.\u201d Sure, the big bad demon could probably handle anything, but she hadn\u2019t planned to walk away and leave him in the fire.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that Beth was an Ignitor?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her heart slammed into her ribs. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cops are pinning the other arsons on her.\u201d His words cut through her soft whisper. \u201cBeth was spotted at the scenes of the other fires. She\u2019s the one who\u2019s going down for them, not you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and tried real hard to suck in air. \u201cBut she wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPak has some Other friends in Louisiana. When Catalina and I told them that Beth was an Ignitor-we saw her eyes and that fire-they put the pieces together. You\u2019re clear, Jana. You don\u2019t have to run from the cops anymore.\u201d</p><p>Perseus wasn\u2019t after her. The cops-were they really going to let her go?</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me about her sooner,\u201d he said, an edge creeping into his voice.</p><p>Enough. She needed to see his eyes when she talked to him. Jana jumped from the bed and hurried toward the far wall. She flipped the switch and light flooded into the room. \u201cThere was nothing to tell!\u201d she snapped. \u201cBeth was an average-level psychic until that night. But she\u2014\u201d Ah, hell, this was the part she\u2019d dreaded. \u201cShe took something from me.\u201d My fire.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t bothered dressing. His arms were at his sides, his cock still up, and he just ... waited.</p> <p>\u201cShe had someone else with her. A new Perseus recruit.\u201d She could still see the woman coming toward her. \u201cAfter you left, Beth offered me a deal.\u201d</p><p>The faint lines near his eyes deepened. \u201cWhat kind of deal?\u201d</p><p>Her breath blew out on a hard sigh. This was the part she\u2019d dreaded. \u201cShe offered me a chance at a normal life. All I had to do was leave you behind and take it.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ll lose the fire, but get your life back. Leave the demon. Walk away and the life you always wanted can be yours.</p><p>Beth had sounded so tempting. So very tempting.</p><p>When the lights in the upstairs room flashed on, Kelly froze. Then she saw the shadows. Two shadows. But Zane had gone in alone.</p> <p>\u201cJana.\u201d Her whisper. She smiled. Talk about an easy mark. Now, she just had to get her girl, without that demon interfering.</p><p>Luckily, she knew the perfect way to take out a demon. Every demon she\u2019d ever met had the same weakness, regardless of their power level.</p><p>She\u2019d done her homework on Zane. Since that bastard had stopped her from taking Jana, she\u2019d had the Bureau dig into his past. She knew all about his family. His father.</p><p>Like father, like son.</p><p>Yes, she knew the demon\u2019s weakness, and if she played her game just right, she\u2019d use that weakness to her advantage.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, she wouldn\u2019t even have to get her hands dirty on this one. She could let the demon do the dirty work for her.</p><p>He could kill Jana Carter.</p><p>No, before she was finished, he would kill Jana.</p> <p>Chapter 14</p><p>\u201cDid you take the deal?\u201d His voice was expressionless.</p><p>Jana shook her head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to leave you there. I\u2019d already seen what they did to paranormals.\u201d Seen, and never been able to forget. \u201cBut Beth wasn\u2019t the type to take no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>The pealing of a bell echoed through the house. Jana\u2019s eyes widened. His doorbell? Someone was downstairs?</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t look away from her. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe-the other psychic came at me. She was human. I-I didn\u2019t want to hurt her\u2014\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang again. \u201cZane ...\u201d she whispered, glancing toward the door, \u201cWhat if ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever it is can go the fuck away.\u201d</p><p>A furious pounding carried through the house. Their guest was slamming a fist into the door. \u201cThe wolf shifter, Marcus, I told him I was coming to you.\u201d They hadn\u2019t spoken much during their drive because, hell, what was there to say? They\u2019d both just wanted to get away from that swamp, as fast as they could.</p><p>He knew she\u2019d been the one sent to kill him. He also knew she hadn\u2019t carried through with her orders. Then they\u2019d both become prisoners.</p><p>Until that night...</p><p>Freedom.</p><p>\u201cSo you did go with him.\u201d An edge sharpened in Zane\u2019s words.</p><p>She nodded and crept toward the door. \u201cHe was the one I told you about. The one Perseus wanted me to kill.\u201d The pounding stopped.</p><p>\u201cZane, what if it\u2019s him or\u2014\u201d Or any of the other assholes who could be after her?</p><p>His gaze hardened. \u201cStay here.\u201d Sounded like a great plan to her.</p><p>He yanked on his jeans and hurried out of the bedroom. His footsteps thudded down the stairs. Her breath caught. Zane could probably handle anyone down there, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here, Tony?\u201d Zane demanded, and his voice carried easily to her.</p><p>Shit. The cop. Jana scrambled for her clothes. She pulled on her jeans-no time to search for the underwear-and shoved her arms into her shirt as she tugged it over her head.</p><p>Tony. He didn\u2019t know she was here. Zane would cover for her, it would be fine. She\u2019d be able to leave after\u2014</p><p>\u201cJana!\u201d Zane\u2019s booming voice exploded up the stairs.</p><p>Horror filled her. No, no, he wouldn\u2019t just sell her out like that. Not after-after what? The sex? Like a man couldn\u2019t turn his back on a woman just because they\u2019d screwed.</p><p>Jana rocked back on her heels. What if it had been a trap? What if Tony had been watching the whole time, and Zane was just going to turn her over to him?</p><p>\u201cJana...\u201d Softer.</p><p>Zane stood in the doorway now. She hadn\u2019t even heard him approach. Tony loomed behind him.</p><p>Her shoulders straightened. So be it. \u201cLet me get my shoes, Captain, and I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d She\u2019d survived being locked up once before. She\u2019d survive again. Right?</p><p>Damn cages.</p><p>Her gaze darted to Zane. What the hell had she really thought would happen? Good guys don\u2019t fall for the bad girls. Zane was firmly aligned on the side of the \u201cgood\u201d guys. She knew that. Why had she even tried to pretend? Why had she come back to him?</p><p>Because he got to me. He\u2019d slid right past the surface and worked his way under her skin. He was her weakness now, one that she\u2019d have to watch.</p><p>Jana shoved her feet into her shoes.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d Tony asked quietly.</p><p>She turned to face him and deliberately kept her hands loose at her sides. \u201cSince yesterday.\u201d Zane\u2019s stare bored into her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the wolf shifter who was in that swamp?\u201d the cop asked.</p><p>Jana shrugged. \u201cWe split up once we got to Baton Rouge.\u201d Why did it matter?</p><p>\u201cSo you ... were with him.\u201d</p><p>Was this an interrogation? \u201cYeah. Yeah, I just said I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he try to hurt you?\u201d The question was Zane\u2019s.</p><p>Jana blinked. \u201cAh ... no.\u201d Okay, and now her stomach was knotting.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to that wolf,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>Good luck with that. She bit the words back.</p><p>\u201cJana ...\u201d Zane stepped closer to her. \u201cThere\u2019s been a killing.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach twisted again. \u201cIn this city\u201d-she kept her voice low and calm\u2014\u201cthere are often killings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this.\u201d Tony shook his head. \u201cNot when a woman\u2019s throat is cut from ear to ear, and I find freaking dog hairs all over the scene.\u201d</p><p>Hell, now the questions about Marcus made sense. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey Meadows, a college student, was killed right outside of her dorm room. Several hundred kids were in that dorm, and no one heard a damn thing.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice vibrated with tension. \u201cShe was last seen having dinner with a blond male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSound familiar?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cI-I don\u2019t ... he didn\u2019t kill those girls in New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. But I need to find that wolf,\u201d Tony told her, \u201cand I need to find him now.\u201d</p><p>Tony wasn\u2019t after her. The knowledge finally sank in. He wasn\u2019t there to haul her to jail. He was after the shifter because he thought Marcus was a killer.</p><p>She remembered pain-filled blue eyes. Hands that trembled. \u201cHe didn\u2019t attack those girls. He wasn\u2019t the killer.\u201d No matter what the news stories had implied, Marcus hadn\u2019t been guilty.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he wasn\u2019t a killer before,\u201d Tony said, \u201cbut I need to see for myself what he is now. If Perseus had him all these months, if they\u2019ve been screwing with his head, there\u2019s no telling what he is.\u201d</p><p>Her fault. She hadn\u2019t realized that Perseus had him-or that vamp who\u2019d taken his bite out of her. But she should have known. When she\u2019d escaped the other lab, there had been paranormals there, too. They\u2019d gotten out when she escaped. Her fire had let them all run free.</p><p>But, of course, Perseus had another facility. Another backup plan.</p><p>Was there another pit still out there? If they\u2019d had one backup location before, wouldn\u2019t they have another now?</p><p>Zane turned away from her. \u201cI want to see the crime scene.\u201d</p><p>Tony frowned. \u201cMy men have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can find things they might have overlooked.\u201d</p><p>Demon senses.</p><p>\u201cLet me at that scene. Let me see what I can find before you start this hunt.\u201d</p><p>Because Zane had seen Marcus and the marks on his body. Trapped. Tortured. She swallowed.</p><p>Tony nodded, his face grim.</p><p>\u201cWhat...\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d Usually a cop would have tried to cuff her by now. But Tony ...</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDidn\u2019t Zane tell you? You\u2019re clear.\u201d His voice was bland. \u201cThe arsonist who started the fires in New Orleans was killed in that blaze at the Perseus headquarters.\u201d</p><p>That deep breath burned in her lungs.</p><p>\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re clear, Ms. Carter.\u201d</p><p>Zane had been telling the truth. He\u2019d done it. He\u2019d gotten her life back.</p><p>\u201cBut I need that shifter.\u201d</p><p>Her life was back, but what about the wolf\u2019s?</p><p>She strode forward and grabbed Zane\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her and a frown pulled his brows together. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time I started doing something for somebody other than myself.\u201d The words came out too fast. She lifted her chin. \u201cMarcus was hurting so much when I first found him. He didn\u2019t ask for any of this.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s gaze held hers. \u201cWe never do.\u201d</p><p>No, they didn\u2019t. But fate just came calling. When she called, you had to answer, even if you\u2019d rather slam down the phone.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get Jude and Erin out there,\u201d he told the cop. \u201cIf a wolf killed at that scene, they\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhead of you, Zane. I already gave \u2018em a call,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>Zane brushed his fingers over her cheek. \u201cStay with me, every second. The PD has cleared you, but the FBI...\u201d</p><p>No, she knew she\u2019d still be high on their extermination list. They\u2019d want their pound of flesh, and so would all the paranormals out there she\u2019d pissed off before. Once they found out about her new weakness, hell, it\u2019d be like sharks who\u2019d sensed blood in the water. They\u2019d come at her in a feeding frenzy.</p><p>\u201cPak\u2019s working on them,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut Special Agent Thomas has you in her sights, and she\u2019s not going to back down easily. For her, it\u2019s personal.\u201d</p><p>Jana blinked. \u201cPersonal? I\u2019ve never done anything to that woman.\u201d</p><p>Zane and Tony shared a long look.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What am I missing?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s personal for her,\u201d Zane said slowly. \u201cBecause one of the men who died in that fire in New Orleans was her stepbrother. Brent Martin. The scientist who\u2014\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ll be awake when I do this and, trust me, it\u2019ll hurt like a bitch.</p><p>\u201cI remember him.\u201d Another guy who\u2019d gotten off on giving pain.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not gonna back down.\u201d Zane\u2019s gaze was steady. \u201cYou have to watch your ass with her.\u201d</p><p>Now, more than ever. Because if-when-Agent Thomas came gunning for her, Jana wouldn\u2019t have the flames to aid her. Not anymore.</p><p>Good thing she still had the gun she\u2019d stolen from the Perseus agents. A girl could never be too careful.</p><p>Personal. Hell. But these days, weren\u2019t all the hunts personal? Always personal and always deadly.</p><p>It was dark outside, the sky pitch black-no moon, no stars. The kind of night that Jana normally loved because it gave perfect cover.</p><p>Tonight that covering darkness had a tingle of shivery awareness skating down her spine.</p><p>They were outside a college dorm room, in the alley that ran just behind the building. The flickering, fluorescent lights trickled a pale glow onto the scene. Tony was ahead of them and already bending under the yellow line of police tape. She could just make out the bloodstains on the ground. Jana\u2019s lips pressed together. Jeez, couldn\u2019t someone have cleaned that up?</p><p>\u201cSo you think we\u2019ve got a wolf hunting again?\u201d The voice was feminine, soft, and tinged with a hint of the South. She hadn\u2019t heard the woman approach. Careful now, Jana slipped deeper into the shadows and watched her. Tall, slim, elegant, the lady seemed perfectly poised in the alley.</p><p>The woman\u2019s small nostrils flared as she drew in the scents. If she hadn\u2019t been watching her so closely, Jana would have missed that telling movement. Shifter. Because no human would be making the effort to inhale in an alley.</p><p>Jude was behind her, and his hand pressed against the small of her back. His nostrils widened as his gaze swept the alley. She knew he-both of them-would be able to see a whole lot more than she could. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve got,\u201d Tony said, running a hand through his hair. \u201cYou tell me, ADA.\u201d</p><p>ADA? As in assistant district attorney. Crap. Jana hunched back into that darkness a bit more.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t smell a wolf, not anywhere around here.\u201d The ADA\u2019s head cocked. \u201cBut you know some shifters can disguise their scents.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike that bastard who was after you,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>Uh, someone had been after the ADA?</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d The growl was Jude\u2019s. There was still rage there. \u201cLike him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you let me see the body,\u201d the ADA offered, \u201cI can tell if the marks were made from claws.\u201d A faint smile lifted her lips. \u201cYou could say I\u2019ve got a lot of experience with wolf marks.\u201d</p><p>Tony edged away from the yellow tape. \u201cJones has the body at the morgue. I already told him you\u2019d be coming.\u201d He sighed. \u201cHe said she didn\u2019t struggle. One swipe-one fast attack to the neck-and she was dead.\u201d</p> <p>Just like the victims back in New Orleans.</p><p>\u201cA human killed those girls.\u201d Jana\u2019s voice sounded way too loud.</p><p>The ADA looked her way. Not with surprise. The woman had known she was lurking there the whole time.</p><p>\u201cThere was no record of a suspect being apprehended for those attacks,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>\u201cBecause Marcus Malone killed him,\u201d Jana said. \u201cThe shifter\u2019s girlfriend was one of the vics. The only time he killed was when he was putting that murdering bastard out of his misery. Marcus might be a wolf, but he-wouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>She felt the weight of the ADA\u2019s stare. Hell. What was her name? What had Tony said? Erica? Erin.</p> <p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Erin asked. \u201cMost folks know that wolves are psychotic.\u201d</p><p>Jude inched closer to the ADA.</p><p>Jana walked out of those shadows. \u201cMarcus had plenty of chances to hurt and kill.\u201d If that had been what he wanted to do, I never would have made it out of that truck. \u201cHe tracked his prey, and he put a sick, sadistic man out of his misery. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like you know a lot about Marcus,\u201d Zane noted blandly. \u201cTalk a lot on that ride up, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you fled the scene of a crime?\u201d Tony tagged on.</p><p>She ignored them both.</p><p>Erin\u2019s gaze stayed on her. \u201cI understand,\u201d the ADA said slowly, \u201cthat this particular wolf was held captive and tortured for the last few months. Something like that could make any man break. And a wolf ...\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easier for a wolf to break,\u201d Jana said, fighting to keep her voice even. \u201cIt\u2019s harder. Yeah, I know wolves have the rep for being crazy, but they\u2019re also smart and incredibly strong. Strong enough to live through hell and survive.\u201d Just like Marcus had. They hadn\u2019t needed to talk. She\u2019d seen the truth in his eyes.</p> <p>They\u2019d walked out of hell together.</p><p>Erin\u2019s head inclined toward her, and it seemed like the tension in Jude\u2019s shoulders eased, just a bit.</p><p>\u201cIf the shifter didn\u2019t kill Lindsey Meadows,\u201d Jana told them, \u201cthen we\u2019ve got a real big problem here.\u201d She had to point it out, though surely everyone had realized that.</p><p>Zane\u2019s arm brushed against Jana\u2019s. Okay. She hadn\u2019t meant to walk to his side. Not really. Her gaze darted to those bloodstains and then back to the ADA\u2019s eyes. Humans were so weak.</p><p>It sucked to be weak, and she sure wasn\u2019t about to show weakness now. She hadn\u2019t been given the chance to finish her confession with Zane. He didn\u2019t know the truth. None of the others knew. As far as they were concerned, as far as the rest of the world was concerned, she was the big, bad fire queen. Get in her way, and she\u2019d burn you to ash.</p><p>\u201cThis crime ...\u201d Even the locations were identical. The freak in New Orleans had always picked alleys just behind the vics\u2019 dorms or apartments. \u201cThe kill\u2014\u201d No defensive wounds. No sign of a struggle. \u201c-and the victim type are all the same. It fits the serial\u2019s M.O.\u201d What was up with the timing of this kill? So close to Marcus\u2019s arrival in town. Too close. \u201cSomeone knows about what happened with the serial killer in New Orleans. About Marcus. And I think that person\u2019s trying to set him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d came from Jude.</p><p>\u201cBecause he was the only actual named suspect in New Orleans. He made the papers. Someone wants the spotlight on him again. Someone wants the cops after him.\u201d Hunted. \u201cSomeone is turning him into prey again.\u201d The supernaturals who cross the line have to be eliminated. The old spiel from Perseus.</p><p>Perseus. Her breath heaved out. \u201cThey know.\u201d \u201cUh, who knows?\u201d Erin asked.</p><p>\u201cProject Perseus. They knew all about Marcus. They could be\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Zane caught her hand. \u201cPerseus is dead, Jana. The organization is finished. The guards who survived were rounded up. Beth was the leader of that group ... the guards confirmed it. She\u2019d started Perseus after a vamp killed her father.\u201d</p><p>She knew about the vampire. I found my father on the ground. The bastard had torn his throat open. Beth\u2019s shaking voice whispered through her mind. Because at the beginning, when she\u2019d first approached Jana, they\u2019d talked. Almost been ... friends.</p><p>No, no, they\u2019d never been friends. Beth\u2019s psychic talent had just made her real good at reading people. And she\u2019d known how to get to Jana.</p><p>She offered me a family. A place to fit in. Things had been fine until Jana turned away from the system. Then the claws had come out.</p><p>\u201cBeth wanted vengeance,\u201d Jana spoke slowly. \u201cAnd I gave it to her.\u201d The first vamp she\u2019d killed for Perseus had been the one who\u2019d drained Beth\u2019s father.</p><p>Thank you. The only words Beth had spoken after that fire. But Beth\u2019s eyes had been blazing.</p><p>That death hadn\u2019t been enough for Beth. Nothing had ever been enough.</p><p>So she\u2019d been the one to start Perseus? Jana had always thought Beth took orders from someone else.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d Zane said. \u201cThe Perseus group is finished.\u201d \u201cNothing ever dies easily in this world,\u201d Jana whispered. The instinct to survive was too strong.</p><p>Marcus Malone knew when he was being hunted. He\u2019d spent too much time being prey not to know that feeling.</p><p>He glanced back over his shoulder, his nostrils flaring. He didn\u2019t see anyone, didn\u2019t smell anyone, but he knew some bastard was out there. Hunting.</p><p>I need to get out of this city.</p><p>Perseus had burned. Those flames had lit the night, and he\u2019d escaped that hellhole, but he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that someone-something-had risen from the flames.</p><p>Coming after me.</p><p>There was only one person in this town he trusted. One woman who\u2019d been through the fire.</p><p>Maybe he should have been afraid of her. After all, Jana had been the one to hunt him before. She\u2019d also been the one to hold back the fire because she\u2019d realized he wasn\u2019t the sadistic killer Perseus had made him out to be.</p><p>And she\u2019d come back for me. He\u2019d caught her scent over the fire and looked up ... and Jana had been there. She\u2019d pulled him from those flames in the swamp. Saved his ass.</p><p>So he\u2019d returned the favor. He\u2019d gotten her away from the cops. Gotten them both to safety.</p><p>But this town wasn\u2019t safe. He swiped a hand over his brow. Not nearly fucking safe enough. Jana thought her demon could protect her.</p><p>Her eyes had been so dark. \u201cIf you need me, I\u2019ll be with Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think you can trust him?\u201d A faint smile had lifted her lips. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the good guys.\u201d</p><p>Marcus didn\u2019t have a lot of experience with good guys. He didn\u2019t trust the demon, but he did trust Jana. She\u2019d studied him, looked beneath the surface. His hands were stained with blood, but that kill-he\u2019d just been avenging his Rita.</p><p>Rita.</p><p>A blinding pain shot through his head. Those fucking headaches. Every time he thought of Rita, his head seemed to rip open.</p><p>He pushed through the bushes and stumbled toward the house on Louis Avenue. Jana would help him. He\u2019d tell her about the eyes on him ... because those eyes could be turning to her. He and Jana were linked. Whoever was after him, well, the asshole could come after her, too.</p><p>Together, they\u2019d be stronger. Those bastards at Perseus had made him so weak. That bitch had come and touched him, while Beth had stood back and laughed. She\u2019d touched him then\u2014</p><p>Weak.</p><p>He was still weak. Too weak. Almost like a human. And the headaches ... Sonofabitch.</p><p>He stumbled and nearly fell onto the porch. The house was dark, but it was late. The demon had to be there, with Jana. They had to\u2014</p><p>\u201cWondered how long it would take for you to crawl out of those shadows.\u201d The voice whispered from the darkness.</p><p>It was a voice Marcus knew. He froze. No, no. But he turned his head and fucking sure enough, the asshole was there. Smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cDid you really think going to the fire whore would save you?\u201d The insidious whisper slipped right under his skin. Marcus kept his eyes on his stalker, aware of the sweat that had burst from his skin, even on the chilly night.</p><p>\u201cJana\u2019s been here, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d the bastard asked.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t there now. Marcus heard nothing from the house. Jana. He needed her, but she was gone. Hell.</p><p>The asshole looked up at the house. \u201cBeen in bed with her demon?\u201d Laughter. \u201cWho would have thought... he was supposed to kill her, not screw her.\u201d</p><p>Marcus\u2019s claws should have been out. They should have been out and his teeth should be razor sharp. But he wasn\u2019t changing. Because that little bitch had touched him.</p><p>You\u2019ll be normal, Marcus. Isn\u2019t that what you want? To be normal? To have a life? No more pain, no more monster. Just a man.</p><p>She\u2019d let the girl touch him.... Then ...</p><p>More laughter and the stalker\u2019s hand lifted. Claws had burst from the jerk\u2019s fingertips. My claws.</p><p>They\u2019d taken too much from him in that prison. Not his life, but his beast.</p><p>A shifter who couldn\u2019t shift. How was he supposed to survive?</p><p>\u201cI thought about letting you live.\u201d The wooden porch creaked. Nowhere to run, not with that devil in front of him. \u201cI thought about it. ...\u201d</p><p>Those claws were up and so close.</p><p>A snarl lifted Marcus\u2019s lips. \u201cI never thought about letting you live.\u201d No, he\u2019d planned to go after this guy, as soon as his strength was back. He\u2019d felt the beast trying to return. The transfer wasn\u2019t permanent, he was sure of it. Once the wolf had been strong again, he\u2019d planned to hunt.</p><p>But he\u2019d already been prey.</p><p>A ghost of a smile appeared on his stalker\u2019s lips. \u201cGuess one of us is dying tonight.\u201d</p><p>Marcus\u2019s head pounded. His heart raced. He lunged forward with his fist raised. The beast inside was screaming, but trapped, trapped\u2014</p><p>Claws slashed across Marcus\u2019s throat. The pain was hell-fire hot, and the blood splashed down his shirt as he tried to breathe, tried to gasp, tried to say ... Rita.</p><p>He fell to his knees.</p><p>\u201cTwo down ...\u201d The whisper filled his ears. The last fucking words he heard were ... \u201cThree to go.\u201d Rita. He could see her now, could see\u2014</p><p>The shifter and the ADA searched the scene. Their eyes- and their noses-probably didn\u2019t miss a thing. But, well, there wasn\u2019t anything to miss.</p><p>\u201cYou found dog hairs on the body?\u201d Jana asked. \u201cJust the body, nowhere else?\u201d Odd. Those wolves sure were hairy beasts.</p><p>But if they weren\u2019t dealing with a wolf ... \u201cJust the body,\u201d Tony agreed.</p><p>Setup. Didn\u2019t the guy see it? Marcus wasn\u2019t the one they wanted for this. No way would a wolf\u2019s fur\u2014so not dog hair-have been left in one spot.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here. Take me to the body,\u201d Erin said flatly.</p><p>Tony nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go. You and Jude can follow me in.\u201d But Erin hesitated beside Jana. \u201cYou don\u2019t really look like a killer.\u201d</p><p>Jana smiled at her. \u201cI know. That\u2019s why I was so good at my job.\u201d Was, shit. She needed to be more careful.</p><p>Erin\u2019s gaze dropped to her throat. \u201cWhat got ahold of you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah, that. \u201cA vamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you burn him? I mean, that\u2019s what you do.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t burn him.\u201d</p><p>The lady waited. Her dark hair blended with the night.</p><p>\u201cShe shot him,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t rip him apart?\u201d Erin shook her head. \u201cZane, I\u2019m surprised at your restraint.\u201d</p><p>Tony hurried to his car. \u201cCome on, we need to get to the station. If this killer\u2019s hunting, we don\u2019t have time to waste.\u201d</p><p>Erin inclined her head. \u201cYou\u2019re right, you know,\u201d she told</p><p>Jana.</p><p>About what?</p><p>\u201cNot all wolves are psychotic.\u201d Her teeth flashed in a white grin. Hmmm ... those teeth looked a little too sharp. \u201cAnd surviving hell is easy for us.\u201d</p><p>Then she was gone. The ADA disappeared into the night with Jude and Tony.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Zane said. \u201cWe need to go to the station and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Okay. A woman had to draw the line somewhere. \u201cI\u2019m not going to the cop house.\u201d Willingly step into the PD? Hell, no. She sucked in a deep gulp of night air. \u201cShe was a wolf? A wolf? Jeez, thanks for the head\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>They walked out of the alley. A few college kids were milling around. Two guys. One girl with long, braided hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s wolf.\u201d A small hesitation. \u201cAnd she\u2019s human. Erin\u2019s a hybrid.\u201d</p><p>Hybrid. She turned toward him, stopping under a street light. At least this one wasn\u2019t flickering. \u201cA hybrid. Like you.\u201d He nodded.</p><p>Jana licked her lips. \u201cBack at Perseus, everything you told them ... was it true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His eyes darkened.</p> <p>The night air grew colder. Another girl came out of the dorm, her shoulders hunched, her hair down. She was moving fast, and her blond hair flew behind her. After what had happened there, Jana didn\u2019t blame the girl. She\u2019d be running fast, too. Don\u2019t want to be caught out alone.</p><p>\u201cMy dad was a sick, sadistic bastard,\u201d Zane said. \u201cOne who just happened to be a demon.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Not exactly a sweet walk down memory lane. She inched closer to him and felt the warmth of his body seep into hers. \u201cMy stepfather was a perverted freak who got off on hurting people, and he happened to be human.\u201d She forced a shrug. \u201cGuess you just can\u2019t ever tell about folks, hmmm?\u201d</p><p>His gaze bored into hers. Black now, she could see that. \u201cYou don\u2019t care that I\u2019m a demon, do you?\u201d</p><p>Um, no. Hadn\u2019t she proven that by all the wild, hot sex she\u2019d had with him?</p> <p>\u201cHave you ever been afraid of me?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Sometimes. Because he made her feel too much. But she didn\u2019t say that. Instead, she asked him, \u201cYou been afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>She expected him to grin. Expected some smart-ass answer. His lips tightened. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>So not the answer she\u2019d wanted to hear.</p><p>His hold on her tightened. \u201cYou scare me ... because you make me weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou push me to the edge. With you, I\u2019m always afraid I\u2019ll go over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you do?\u201d So what?</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cCome on.\u201d The others had already left. Gone to the PD.</p><p>He opened the passenger door for her. Jana climbed in. Her legs slid over the leather. Zane stared down at her, then leaned forward. \u201cYou trust me.\u201d He seemed surprised.</p><p>But, hell, not as surprised as she was because, yeah, she did.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Zane started to pull away.</p><p>Jana grabbed his hand. \u201cI think you\u2019re the only one I should trust.\u201d He\u2019d never betrayed her. Hadn\u2019t lied to her. Hadn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I can do.\u201d</p> <p>She had a pretty good idea. She\u2019d been with him in the fire. His eyes were level with hers. \u201cI killed him,\u201d he said, whispering the words. \u201cMy own father, and I didn\u2019t even hesitate.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers squeezed his. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could still smell her blood on him. The bastard was high on his fucking drugs. Always the damn drugs. He killed her, gutted her, all because she tried to take away his drugs. She just wanted him to get clean.\u201d</p><p>Jana swallowed. \u201cGet in the car, Zane.\u201d She didn\u2019t like him being in the open. \u201cLet\u2019s go back home.\u201d She wanted to be alone with him. To hold him. Weird. She\u2019d never wanted to just hold a man before, but Zane wasn\u2019t any man.</p><p>His jaw clenched. He pulled back, slammed her door, and hurried around to the driver\u2019s side. When he jumped in, he revved the engine.</p><p>Jana touched the masculine fingers that gripped the wheel so tightly. \u201cYou did what you had to do.\u201d She could understand that more than any other.</p><p>Slowly, his head turned to face her. His gaze was blacker than the night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of power inside me,\u201d he told her, his voice quiet in the stillness of the car. \u201cMaybe too much. I can do things ...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cKilling him was easy for me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never told her his demon power scale. She understood why. Most people feared the demons who tipped the scales. He didn\u2019t want to be feared, just accepted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got power, but you\u2019ve got control of it.\u201d The control was what mattered. Control separated the demons from the monsters.</p><p>\u201cMy control broke that night. I was just a kid.\u201d His fingers whitened around the steering wheel. \u201cBut I killed him in an instant.\u201d His lids lowered a bit. \u201cWhat do you think would happen now if I lost my control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you would.\u201d After everything they\u2019d been through ... no, the man had always been strong. Even when he faced death.</p><p>He laughed at that and shifted to reverse with a hard yank of his hand. \u201cBaby, you don\u2019t even know how close I\u2019ve been.\u201d The car slid back. He shifted again. \u201cAnd you\u2019d better hope you never see me that way. Because when my control shatters, hell comes calling.\u201d</p><p>If he was as high on the scale as she believed, yeah, that could happen.</p><p>He drove fast. His eyes stayed locked on the road, and not on her anymore.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to the police station,\u201d she told him and kept her fingers against him. \u201cTake us back to your place.\u201d Because she wasn\u2019t afraid of him-or the hell he promised.</p><p>The car raced forward. Faster, faster, into the dark.</p><p>Fury coiled tight in Zane\u2019s belly. Jana didn\u2019t understand. She didn\u2019t see him, not the real man. If she knew what hid under his skin, if they all knew ...</p><p>They\u2019d fucking run.</p><p>But she sat beside him, and she kept touching him. The woman should be pulling away. He\u2019d tried to warn her while there was still time.</p><p>Because time was running out for Jana Carter. He\u2019d realized that when he\u2019d found her in his bedroom. She wasn\u2019t just a fast screw. Someone to hold in the dark. A body to give him pleasure. No, she\u2019d started to mean more.</p><p>Hell, he wasn\u2019t even sure when the change had happened, but she mattered to him. Mattered more than anything or anyone else. And that was very dangerous.</p><p>No one got too close to him. He didn\u2019t let himself care. He even kept the other Night Watch hunters at a distance. Because when he cared too much, if he let someone slip past his guard ...</p><p>Dangerous.</p><p>But already, the demon wanted her. Jana had a darkness inside of her that the demon in Zane liked. She knew the horrors in the world. Wasn\u2019t afraid of them. Wasn\u2019t afraid of him.</p><p>When she should have been.</p><p>He risked a glance at her from the corner of his eye. Fucking beautiful. Deceptively delicate. And ... Mine.</p><p>Maybe time had already run out for her.</p><p>He spun the car into his horseshoe drive and eased up on the gas. She\u2019d called his place \u201chome.\u201d Did she even realize that? Did it matter to her? It sure as shit mattered to him.</p><p>His headlights flashed across the front of the house ... and illuminated the body on the porch.</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>Zane slammed on the brakes.</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d</p><p>Jana hadn\u2019t seen the man. He killed the lights. \u201cStay here,\u201d he growled, already jerking free of his seat belt and shoving open the car door.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d The buckle clicked as she unhooked her belt. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay. Here.\u201d He wasn\u2019t about to risk her. Not until he found out what was happening.</p><p>The blood hit him. The thick, coppery scent hung in the air. Strong and fresh.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>His gaze raked the yard. He didn\u2019t see anyone else, but that didn\u2019t mean someone wasn\u2019t there, watching him.</p><p>Zane crept up the front steps, his eyes on the body. Worn boots, old, faded jeans, a too big, bloody blue shirt. When he saw the vic\u2019s face, the breath expelled from Zane\u2019s lungs in a rush.</p><p>He knew that face. Knew that dirty blond hair and those pale, haggard features. He\u2019d seen the man just days before- when the wolf shifter had fled the fire.</p><p>Now, Marcus Malone lay on Zane\u2019s porch, his right arm stretched toward the door, like he was trying to get help. The poor bastard\u2019s throat had been ripped wide open. Ear to ear.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes closed. This kid hadn\u2019t been the killer.</p><p>Victim.</p><p>The car door groaned behind him. \u201cZane?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her to see this. She\u2019d tried to save the wolf.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>His enhanced vision showed him every detail of the scene. No defensive wounds on the shifter\u2019s body. And ... his clothes weren\u2019t torn. The poor bastard hadn\u2019t even been given a chance to shift. The killer had come on him too quickly.</p><p>And how the hell did someone sneak up on a wolf shifter?</p><p>His head snapped up. The same way a killer can-will- sneak up on a demon. When you were dealing with super-naturals, all bets were off.</p><p>His gaze flew back to his vehicle. Jana stood half in, half out of the car.</p><p>He jumped off the porch and rushed to her side. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big damn problem.\u201d He pushed her inside and slammed the door. His eyes searched the night. Can\u2019t see anyone. Can\u2019t hear anyone.</p><p>But Marcus hadn\u2019t gotten much warning, either.</p><p>He hurried back to the driver\u2019s side. He\u2019d have to call Pak and Tony. A cleanup crew was needed ASAP. They had to get the body out of there before dawn, before any neighbors could see what had happened. And Night Watch had to figure out-fucking fast-what they were dealing with here.</p><p>Perseus? Was the group still active? How? The agents were locked up, courtesy of Chief Daniels. Their leader was dead.</p><p>\u201cZane...\u201d</p><p>He spun out of the drive.</p><p>\u201cZane, tell me what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to. This world was full of things he didn\u2019t want to do. \u201cMarcus isn\u2019t our killer.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been telling you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d He yanked out his phone and called Pak even as his eyes snapped to the rearview mirror. No one followed them. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis body was on my porch. The poor bastard\u2019s throat had been ripped out.\u201d Someone had just killed a wolf shifter like it was fucking nothing. Wolf shifters were hard bastards to kill.</p><p>No time for defensive wounds. No time to attack. There\u2019d been no blood under Marcus\u2019s nails. No torn clothing. Just like the other scene.</p><p>Who the hell had killed the guy and why?</p><p>The only links he had to Marcus were Jana and ... Perseus.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>The morgue was cold and quiet, just like the fucking grave that it was. Antonio shifted his right foot and wondered how in the hell the ADA could just stand there peering at the gaping wound that had been the vic\u2019s throat. And Erin was close. Right down at the throat, staring with narrowed eyes. The scent alone should have been enough to choke her but\u2014</p><p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t wolf claw marks. They\u2019re close, but they\u2019re ... off. Just a little different.\u201d</p><p>Antonio\u2019s brows snapped up. \u201cAh, you sure?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze met his. \u201cI know wolf claw marks when I see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Jude added, his voice rumbling. \u201cAnd I know a shifter\u2019s scent when I smell it-there\u2019s not a drop of shifter odor on her.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThe girl wasn\u2019t killed by a wolf.\u201d</p><p>Then what had attacked her?</p><p>Jude\u2019s phone rang. He hurriedly pulled it out of his pocket and turned away from them. \u201cDonovan.\u201d Silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck? Are you serious?\u201d Jude threw a glance back at them. \u201cYeah, well, we\u2019d already figured it wasn\u2019t him.\u201d</p><p>Antonio knew the call wasn\u2019t bringing good news.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still at the morgue. No, man, I don\u2019t know what the hell got ahold of her. The marks are like a wolf shifter\u2019s but ... no, Erin and I both say they don\u2019t match.\u201d A brief pause. \u201cYeah, the scent\u2019s wrong.\u201d His eyes narrowed as he listened and paced. \u201cWhere are you? Do I need to come\u2014\u201d</p><p>He broke off. Erin edged closer to Jude. Her hand lifted to rub against his back. \u201cYeah, yeah, we\u2019ll wait for you,\u201d he said into the phone. \u201cHurry in.\u201d</p><p>Jude ended the call and huffed out a hard breath. His gaze met Antonio\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve got one guy you can mark off your suspect list.\u201d</p><p>His gut twisted.</p><p>\u201cMarcus Malone didn\u2019t kill that girl.\u201d \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane is.\u201d A long sigh. \u201cBecause the bastard who murdered the co-ed killed Marcus. Zane just found the wolf shifter\u2019s body. Malone\u2019s throat was clawed open. The poor bastard bled out on Zane\u2019s porch.\u201d</p><p>Well, damn. Just like Lindsey Meadows. Antonio\u2019s gaze lingered on her pale form. Someone was hunting in his city. Not being quiet about it either. Fast, brutal kills.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re linked.\u201d Obviously. He just didn\u2019t know how. A wolf shifter ... a college kid ... why? What had made those two into targets?</p><p>The door to the morgue opened with a squeak. His head turned, and his hand went to his holster. Too much damn stress lately. But at this time of night, no one else should be there\u2014</p><p>And he sure as shit shouldn\u2019t be seeing Catalina.</p><p>But the witch stood in the doorway. Her eyes, wide and green, met his. Her white-blond hair tumbled down her shoulders, and her lips, normally dark red, but now light pink, were pressed into a tight line.</p><p>\u201cCatalina?\u201d Jude called, his voice gruff. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re hunting me,\u201d she whispered as she came slowly into the room, her feet shuffling over the floor. \u201cI could feel the darkness coming. I-I scryed. I had to see what was going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Scryed. A cold wind seemed to blow against Antonio\u2019s neck. He didn\u2019t like it when Catalina pulled out her dark mirror and tried to glimpse the future. As far as he was concerned, peering into that mirror was just asking for trouble. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And the last time she\u2019d gone looking to see what the future held, she\u2019d seen death for her friends.</p><p>Luckily, she\u2019d been wrong about that vision. Well, kind of wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d Jude admonished. \u201cYou\u2019re already weak from the two binding marks. Your powers aren\u2019t strong enough\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re not. They\u2019re not strong enough for me to see who is coming after me, but they were strong enough to show that if I don\u2019t do something, I\u2019ll be burning.\u201d</p><p>Shit. What was the surefire way to destroy a witch? The fire. The old bastards during the Burning Times had been right about that move. Bind a witch, burn her, and you get her powers.</p><p>Catalina straightened her shoulders. \u201cSomeone is coming after the survivors.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he wasn\u2019t going to like where this was going. Antonio hurried to Catalina\u2019s side. The skin under her eyes looked bruised. Hell, she looked bruised. Too pale. Too fragile. He almost reached for her, but he stopped and clenched his hands into fists. \u201cWhere\u2019s the vamp?\u201d The last thing he needed was that vampire popping up in the morgue.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ...\u201d She swallowed. \u201cFeeding.\u201d</p> <p>Right.</p><p>Jude growled.</p><p>Catalina\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cHe\u2019s not killing anyone! He\u2019s just drinking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way the bastard drank from Jana?\u201d Yeah, he\u2019d gotten all the details from Zane.</p><p>Catalina flinched. \u201cHe\u2019s being hunted, too. He has to be at full strength.\u201d</p><p>Survivors. Antonio rubbed the back of his neck. The knots were building beneath the skin. \u201cLet\u2019s start at the beginning, and let\u2019s go real slow.\u201d Erin and Jude closed in.</p> <p>\u201cFirst up, how the hell did you know we were down here?\u201d</p><p>A ghost of a smile lifted her pale lips. \u201cPak told me.\u201d</p><p>Figured. Pak knew just about everything, and he\u2019d certainly be keeping tabs on his hunter.</p><p>Antonio huffed out a breath. \u201cLook, Catalina, I\u2019ve got a dead co-ed and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey Meadows.\u201d</p><p>Right. The media didn\u2019t know the victim\u2019s identity yet, but Catalina did.</p><p>She told him, \u201cIf you check your records, you\u2019ll see that Lindsey\u2019s half-sister disappeared about six months ago. Lindsey filed a missing person\u2019s report, but then she came back and said she\u2019d talked to Laura, that everything was fine.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d already checked the records. He knew this. Tony also knew- \u201cI\u2019m guessing the sister isn\u2019t fine.\u201d</p> <p>Catalina tensed. Her eyes widened an instant before the door pushed open again. Zane loomed in the doorway, and his little Ignitor was right at his side.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if the sister is fine,\u201d Catalina said. \u201cShe knows.\u201d There was some anger there. Fear.</p><p>It made sense that a witch would fear the Ignitor. Any smart person would fear her. Catalina had always struck him as the smart type.</p><p>Everyone turned to look at Zane and Jana-and they waited.</p><p>Kelly Thomas edged onto Zane\u2019s porch, her gun drawn. She\u2019d kept her eyes on the demon and tailed him back to his place-and she\u2019d seen the way the guy high-tailed out of there. Like the devil was chasing him.</p><p>She could smell the blood, so she knew\u2014</p><p>Kelly sucked in a sharp breath when she saw the body. The poor guy-his throat had been sliced right open, a sick smile that stretched far too wide.</p><p>The stench clogged her nose, and she stumbled off the porch. Wrenching out her phone, she dialed her contact with a press of her fingers. \u201cStart a search for Zane Wynter and Jana Carter. What? No, I don\u2019t care what Miller said. They just killed someone. Killed him. Send some agents and the cops out to 133 Louis Avenue.\u201d</p><p>Her fault. Her fault that poor kid was dead. She should have struck faster.</p><p>But there\u2019d be more innocent blood lost. She was putting an end to this hell.</p><p>Time to eliminate the Ignitor and the demon that Jana had brought to her side.</p><p>Okay, having everyone stare at her was ... weird. Not like she was super comfortable being down there with the dead bodies, anyway.</p><p>The cop eyed Jana with a narrowed gaze. Seriously suspicious eyes. What else was new?</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Laura?\u201d Catalina asked.</p><p>Jana blinked. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaura.\u201d The witch repeated. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any Laura.\u201d Jeez. Didn\u2019t they realize what was happening? Zane had called and told them about Marcus. They should have been\u2014</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s about five-foot-seven, and she\u2019s got long, straight brown hair. She wears glasses that are so thick-too thick. And her nose is crooked,\u201d Catalina spoke with her eyes still locked on Jana, \u201clike it\u2019s been broken before, and she\u2019s got a small black mole near the corner of her chin.\u201d</p><p>The description had Jana\u2019s heart racing.</p><p>Catalina said, \u201cTell us where she is.\u201d</p><p>Jana took a deep breath. Then one more.</p><p>Zane\u2019s arm brushed her side. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about, Cat? Look, the shifter is dead. He was sliced open on my doorstep. Pak is sending a cleanup crew over, but we\u2019ve got a damn serious problem on our hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the cop said. \u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>Jana realized her palms were starting to sweat.</p><p>\u201cThe survivors are being eliminated. One by one.\u201d Okay, that witch\u2019s voice was just eerie. So blank. So ... dead.</p><p>It took a minute for the words to sink in. Survivors. Oh, shit. \u201cYou mean Marcus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s not happy that the supernaturals got out of Perseus alive,\u201d Catalina said. \u201cI scryed. I saw ... I\u2019m going to die.\u201d The witch sprang forward in a sudden burst of motion and grabbed Jana\u2019s shirt, yanking her forward. \u201cWhere the hell is Laura?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatalina!\u201d Zane lunged for the witch.</p><p>Yeah, she didn\u2019t need his help. The day she let a witch get the best of her in a fight... That day ain\u2019t comin'. The other woman was just embarrassing her now. Jana slammed her forehead into Catalina\u2019s. The witch howled and those nails- more like claws-stopped digging into Jana\u2019s shirt as Catalina stumbled back.</p><p>Jana fisted her right hand and got ready to punch the chick.</p><p>Zane\u2019s fingers curled around her fist. \u201cEasy.\u201d His black stare glittered at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who went crazy.\u201d And it stung, dammit, hurt, that he was telling her to back off. Crazy witch woman was the one who needed to be controlled.</p><p>We have a friend of yours.</p><p>Oh, right, but he cared about the witch. While she ... hell, what was she to him? Did she matter?</p><p>Zane turned his head and focused on Catalina. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Jana pulled her hand away from his.</p><p>Tears trickled down Catalina\u2019s cheeks. Oh, great, tears. Now Zane would probably crumble because the witch was pretty and crying and\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell did you attack her?\u201d Zane demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause she was the last person to see Laura alive! I know she was!\u201d</p><p>Okay. Catalina was right about that. Now all the eyes were back on Jana. She cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhy is this Laura important?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Catalina pointed toward the body on the gurney. A body Jana had been trying to ignore. \u201cShe\u2019s important because her sister is the one who had her throat torn out last night. Laura is psychic. She was working with Perseus. I saw her there. She was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was there the night the flames went wild.\u201d Jana tried to keep her voice emotionless. She licked her lips and met Zane\u2019s stare. \u201cShe didn\u2019t... survive the fire.\u201d Flat words. Quiet.</p><p>But she\u2019d never forget the sight of Laura dying. A touch ... the woman had touched her, stolen her fire, then transferred it to Beth. All with a touch.</p><p>But Laura hadn\u2019t understood the flames. The fire had been too much for her, and by the time she\u2019d tried to give the power to Beth ...</p><p>The fire had consumed Laura. She\u2019d burned, from the inside out, even as Beth screamed and ordered that Laura touch her and transfer the power.</p><p>Before she\u2019d died, Laura had managed to transfer some of that power. And even that bit had proven too much for Beth in the end.</p><p>Catalina\u2019s shoulders sagged. \u201cLindsey must have known about Perseus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why she canceled the missing person\u2019s search.\u201d Tony slowly shook his head.</p><p>Missing person\u2019s search?</p><p>\u201cShe knew where her sister was,\u201d he muttered, running a hand through his hair. \u201cLaura must\u2019ve called her. She must\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told her sister too much about Perseus.\u201d Catalina\u2019s voice held a hint of sadness. \u201cSo much that someone thought Lindsey had to die.\u201d</p><p>Now there were two dead in the city: Lindsey and Marcus.</p><p>Erin cleared her throat. \u201cUm, sorry if I seem dense here, but I thought you guys had taken down Perseus? Isn\u2019t the group dead?\u201d</p><p>Catalina shook her head. \u201cSomeone is still alive. Someone with a lot of power.\u201d</p><p>Someone who wasn\u2019t afraid to kill.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all on the list. Everyone who was there while the place burned.\u201d Catalina\u2019s eyes darted to Tony, Jude, then Zane.</p><p>\u201cFuck the list,\u201d Jude said instantly.</p><p>Catalina looked at Jana. \u201cBet you\u2019re at the top of the list, Ignitor.\u201d</p><p>Jana forced a reckless smile. \u201cBring it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill so brave?\u201d Catalina asked, narrowing her eyes. \u201cEven after what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit, she knew. Jana kept her chin up. \u201cWhat do you want me to do? Run away into the shadows? Hide while someone else dies?\u201d Who did the witch think she was talking to? \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. If some asshole is out there hunting survivors, I\u2019ll be ready to face him.\u201d With or without her power.</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t be,\u201d Catalina said, drawing back. \u201cNot when death has you in his sights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for that happy little update.\u201d Didn\u2019t sound like a fuzzy Christmas card, but when had life ever been a fuzzy Christmas card?</p><p>\u201cYou scryed.\u201d Zane stepped back from the witch and came closer to Jana. Finally. \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw me getting torched.\u201d Her gaze came back to Jana. \u201cSome people like to watch those flames burn.\u201d</p><p>Okay, now she was pushing too far. \u201cI\u2019ve never burned a witch. Never killed someone who didn\u2019t deserve my fire. You think I killed for shits and giggles, is that it?\u201d She closed the distance between her and the witch. \u201cMy stepfather was a perverted freak. Those demons and vampires-they tortured and murdered humans. They came after me, so I stopped them. I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby.\u201d Zane was there, wrapping his arms around her and pulling her back against the warm, strong lines of his chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain a damn thing to them.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew around the room. Jude stared unblinkingly back at her. Erin ... there was understanding in her gaze. Tony scowled. The witch-ah, screw her.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did you see, Catalina?\u201d Zane demanded.</p><p>Her lips firmed. \u201cLogan got staked. I mean, he-he will get staked.\u201d</p><p>The vamp who\u2019d tried to make her into his buffet? Was she supposed to care about what would happen to him?</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time,\u201d Catalina whispered. \u201cThe killer is closing in.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s arms were strong and steady. His scent surrounded her. \u201cDid you see who was coming?\u201d His words seemed to vibrate around her.</p><p>Catalina shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m too weak.\u201d A brief hesitation. \u201cWe all are.\u201d Those words weren\u2019t directed at Zane. Catalina knew too much. \u201cThey weakened us, and now we\u2019re just prey to them. That\u2019s what they wanted. For us to be the ones who were hunted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be hunted,\u201d Jude said. \u201cI\u2019m not weak. Zane\u2019s not. We\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he weak?\u201d Catalina asked as her eyes bored into Jana. \u201cI saw what happened when Logan bit you. His dark side almost took over. Do you know what happens when Zane loses control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. Enough of this,\u201d Zane blasted. His hold was unbreakable, but a hard knot had formed in Jana\u2019s chest. \u201cI\u2019m not losing control and no one else is dying. No one. \u201c</p><p>His words were a vow.</p><p>Catalina pushed past them. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right. But I\u2019m afraid that you\u2019re dead wrong.\u201d Then she ran out the door, her shoes slapping against the floor.</p><p>\u201cFollow her,\u201d Zane ordered.</p><p>Jude nodded quickly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not running again, and she\u2019s not dying,\u201d he added. Jude\u2019s fingers skated down Erin\u2019s cheek. \u201cBe safe,\u201d Jana heard the ADA whisper softly.</p><p>Jude kissed Erin, a light, tender press of the lips. Then he was gone as he trailed after the witch.</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath feathered over Jana\u2019s ear. \u201cThere\u2019s a dead body on my porch.\u201d</p><p>Jana took a slow breath. It seemed to burn her lungs. Marcus hadn\u2019t deserved to die like that. He should have finally been free.</p><p>\u201cTony, you\u2019re gonna want to get some of your men out there to work the scene with Night Watch. Send those who know the score.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded and eased past them as he headed out the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call the DA,\u201d Erin said, brushing back her hair. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure he understands Night Watch has point on this one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks, Erin.\u201d Again, his voice vibrated behind Jana.</p><p>Erin stopped next to them. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what others think about you,\u201d she told Jana. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they think you\u2019re a freak or a monster ...\u201d</p><p>What if I am?</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know you.\u201d A wisp of a smile lifted Erin\u2019s lips. \u201cThey don\u2019t know us.\u201d Then she was gone.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d She didn\u2019t like the smell. Didn\u2019t like the bodies. Didn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>Zane kept a tight hold on her as he led her from the morgue. They hurried down the hallway, raced up the stairs and\u2014</p><p>He pushed her back against the hard, stone wall of the stairwell. His eyes glittered down at her. \u201cYou\u2019re holding back on me.\u201d</p><p>Jana swallowed. His eyes were so dark. Really, a demon\u2019s eyes shouldn\u2019t have been sexy. Scary maybe, sure. Not sexy.</p> <p>But his were. So sexy her knees shook and her panties were getting wet.</p><p>He slapped his hands on either side of her head. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me? Fuck, don\u2019t you know by now, you can trust me? I\u2019m not going to turn on you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cI do trust you.\u201d A painful admission. She\u2019d never trusted anyone fully. Certainly not those assholes at Perseus-and her wariness had sure paid off. But she\u2019d never trusted her handful of lovers or her so-called friends.</p><p>\u201cNo, you keep waiting. Keep watching me. You think I\u2019m going to screw you over.\u201d He shook his head, and she saw the muscle flex in his jaw. \u201cWhat do I have to do? How do I prove to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to do anything. \u201cBeth offered me a deal in that shithole.\u201d She\u2019d told him that part already. But now it was time for the full confession. \u201cIf I walked away and left you on your own, I could get my life back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow were you supposed to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe said she could take away the fire. The witch was right. Laura was psychic. She just had to touch me, and she could get my fire.\u201d Do it, tell him. \u201cShe could get the fire ...\u201d Do it, tell him. \u201cAnd transfer the power to someone else.\u201d</p><p>His whole face hardened. \u201cBeth.\u201d He shoved away from the wall.</p><p>\u201cI-I told you she wasn\u2019t an Ignitor.\u201d And she hadn\u2019t been. \u201cBut that night, she got my power. Beth got it, and she used it to attack you and everyone else in that place.\u201d She\u2019d burned Perseus to the ground. Even though she hadn\u2019t gotten the full rush of fire-not like poor Laura-Beth still hadn\u2019t been able to control the flames. Only Jana could control the fire.</p><p>Beth should have realized that as soon as the psychic burned.</p><p>He turned away. His shoulders were ramrod straight, and the fury rolled off him in waves. \u201cWas it worth it?\u201d</p><p>What? She stood frozen against the wall.</p><p>\u201cI knew there was something different about you. I couldn\u2019t figure out...\u201d A harsh laugh. \u201cAnd you shot the vamp. You didn\u2019t incinerate the asshole. You shot him.\u201d</p><p>Her lips were too dry. Jana swiped her tongue over them and forced herself to step forward. \u201cI tried to call up the fire when he attacked me, but nothing happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019d fucking traded your fire and me for your freedom.\u201d His voice echoed up the stairwell. \u201cAnd here I thought you ...\u201d</p><p>He thought she-what? Her heart slammed into her chest. \u201cZane, it\u2019s not like that!\u201d Her hand reached out to him.</p><p>He glanced back at her, his face a hard mask. \u201cI pulled you out of that fire at Perseus. I went back for you before I helped anyone else.\u201d Disgust had his lips tightening. \u201cAnd you\u2019d already screwed me over.\u201d</p><p>Then he walked away. Zane marched up those stairs. Walked. Away.</p><p>No. \u201cI went back for you, too!\u201d He kept walking. \u201cZane! I went back into the fire, when I didn\u2019t have any power, for you. I wasn\u2019t leaving you, dammit! I wasn\u2019t going to let you burn!\u201d</p><p>But he was still leaving her and her heart seemed to burn in her chest. Don\u2019t leave me. She ran up the stairs after him. He was close to the exit, the one that led to the back parking lot. She grabbed his arm and forced him to stop. She yanked him around-and made him look at her. \u201cWhere\u2019s your trust?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His eyes were as cold as black ice.</p><p>Damn him. \u201cYou think I sold you out so easily? You think I tossed you over to be damn normal?\u201d Her nails dug into his arms. \u201cMy fire is the only thing that has saved me over the years. First from that bastard who tried to break me. He came into my room, every freaking night and watched me. I knew what was coming, I knew, and I prayed for some way to stop him.\u201d</p><p>The mask began to crack. Screw him. She wasn\u2019t done talking.</p><p>\u201cMy mother didn\u2019t believe me. No one would help me. No one. He started hitting me, and it got worse, and worse, and I knew he had so much more planned. I knew\u2014\u201d She broke off as emotion clogged her throat. \u201cI prayed, and I got my fire. I stopped him.\u201d Over the years, the fire had kept her safe. Always. \u201cWhen the assholes in the dark come after me, they\u2019re the ones who run away scared because I control the flames. They\u2019re the ones who beg for mercy. Not me.\u201d</p><p>She felt the wet trickle of his blood on her fingertips. Her nails had dug in too deep. Her hands lifted, and her fingers balled into fists. \u201cI stopped wanting to be normal a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared. \u201cBut you still sold me out.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh was brittle. \u201cWould it have killed you\u201d-she asked him, stepping toward the exit now because it was her turn to leave him\u2014\u201cto have trusted me, just a little bit?\u201d</p><p>Good sex. No, great sex. Maybe that was all they\u2019d ever had. Why had she expected more? \u201cA human was coming at me.\u201d She didn\u2019t look in his eyes as she spoke now. She couldn\u2019t. \u201cBeth was shouting some crazy shit about me being normal, saying all I had to do was walk away.\u201d Laura ... the girl\u2019s eyes had been wide. Sad. Tears had glittered behind her glasses. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt Laura. She didn\u2019t seem like a threat to me.\u201d</p><p>He shifted and edged closer to her.</p><p>\u201cI thought ... I thought Perseus was using her, just like they\u2019d used me. I didn\u2019t want to hurt her,\u201d she said again as the memory surged through her. \u201cThen she lunged at me. She touched me and barely let her fingers skim down my side.</p><p>And it had felt like the woman sliced her open with a hot knife.</p><p>Jana tossed back her head. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, look.\u201d Her eyes held his. \u201cLook. \u201c</p><p>She felt the hard psychic push against her mind. Laura stood before her, the woman\u2019s thin body trembling. Hell, where was Zane? \u201cDon\u2019t take another step.\u201d Laura froze.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when she takes the fire away? Where does it go?\u201d Jana asked.</p><p>Beth didn\u2019t answer and the girl wasn\u2019t speaking. Her eyes looked so big behind the glasses, and her skin was stark white.</p><p>An alarm sounded then. A high-pitched, whining alarm. Beth jerked and swore. \u201cDumb bitch. She should\u2019ve just done her damn part.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>Footsteps thundered outside.</p><p>Beth\u2019s face hardened. Her hand lifted and she stabbed a finger in the air toward Jana. \u201cThe demon is going to die. If he won\u2019t help us, then we\u2019ll rip him apart.</p><p>\u201cBut first...\u201d And the guards spilled into the room. \u201cFirst we\u2019re taking that fire from you. We\u2019re taking it, and we\u2019re going to make sure you\u2019re nothing but a corpse when we leave this room.\u201d</p><p>Now, this was the Beth she knew and hated. \u201cBring it, bitch.\u201d Jana let the charge shoot through her. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re strong enough, come on.\u201d A line of fire split the floor between them. Charge more. Charge. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you still like my fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot her!\u201d Beth screamed at the guards. \u201cNot the head or the heart, but shoot her! Take her down!\u201d</p><p>The bullets flew through the air just as the flames blazed higher.</p><p>Laura stumbled forward, careening dangerously close to the fire. Jana lunged toward her. Laura\u2019s fingers brushed her arm.</p><p>Pain. It sliced through her. Agony that burned and burned and burned.</p><p>Jana screamed and fell to the floor.</p><p>Beth\u2019s laughter echoed around her. \u201cGive it to me! Give it to me!\u201d</p><p>Something was ripping out of Jana. Clawing its way out of her body. Burning claws, hacking their way to the surface. Tears streamed down her face. \u201cZ-Zane ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t help you. He won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her palms slapped against the floor. She forced her head up. Those flames ...</p><p>Laura stared back at her with eyes too wide. Beth was holding the girl\u2019s hand, squeezing tight. \u201cGive it to me.\u201d</p><p>Smoke began to drift from Laura\u2019s nostrils. From her mouth. Her eyes. \u201cGive it to me!\u201d</p><p>Jana tried to speak, but blood trickled from her lips and splattered onto the floor.</p><p>Laura\u2019s pale skin reddened. Beth laughed. Laughed and took the power.</p><p>Beth\u2019s hand fell away from Laura just as the fire erupted. Laura screamed.</p><p>So did Jana. She screamed for Zane because she knew Beth was going after him, and she couldn\u2019t do a damn thing to stop the bitch.</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d The snarl broke from her lips as Jana\u2019s temples throbbed. He\u2019d seen e-damn-nough. He hadn\u2019t believed her.</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath heaved out, and the bastard reached for her. Reached for her. Right, like she wanted him touching her then. \u201cI\u2019m not the one with the trust issues. I didn\u2019t turn on you, haven\u2019t ever. Hell, I came back to you. I could have run. You wouldn\u2019t have ever seen me again, but I came to your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Seemed torn from him.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a damn idiot.\u201d She grabbed for the door.</p><p>\u201cJana\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled tight around the doorknob. \u201cYou got to me, demon.\u201d She was ashamed to admit it. She\u2019d fallen so easily. Started falling that first day, when he\u2019d come through the fire for her on Francis Street. She\u2019d thought she could count on him.</p><p>A good guy, her ass. Just another wolf inside. No, a demon inside.</p><p>She wrenched open the door and hurried outside. The cold night air bit into her face and arms and cut right through her clothes. Her teeth chattered before she was even halfway across the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you go, Jana!\u201d His words carried easily on the wind. Loud, angry. Desperate? No, not desperate. Zane was never desperate for anything.</p><p>But those were just the words she needed to hear, the words that pissed her off. Jana spun back to face him. \u201cYou don\u2019t let me do anything. I do what I want, always have, always will. And right now, I\u2019m leaving you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t rush toward her. Didn\u2019t run. Just ... stalked her. Slowly. Like she was prey and he had her cornered. He doesn\u2019t.</p><p>His eyes blazed with emotion that she couldn\u2019t read. So much emotion swirling in those deep eyes. \u201cIs leaving me really what you want?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Not answering that. She couldn\u2019t have what she wanted. That was obvious. He didn\u2019t trust me. Had to look in my mind to see the truth. \u201cThere\u2019s a killer in this town, apparently coming after me.\u201d Talk about kicking a girl when she was down. \u201cAccording to your witch girlfriend, I\u2019m dead center on the target list and\u2014\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shot up, but he kept coming at her. \u201cCatalina isn\u2019t my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew that. You\u2019ve slept together.\u201d Why was she bringing this up now? Like this mattered with all the other crap that was happening. I don\u2019t care what he does with the witch. I\u2019m leaving. Not my business anymore. The back lot was deserted. Frost had settled over the handful of cars parked there, and a small pool of light spilled from the building.</p><p>\u201cWe have slept together,\u201d he confirmed and Jana wished, wished, she had her fire back then.</p><p>Zane stopped in front of her, bracing his legs, and throwing back his shoulders. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been over a long time. Catalina knew she wasn\u2019t the one for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Did she scry that, too?\u201d she tossed out as her breath formed a cloud in front of her face.</p><p>\u201cYes, she did.\u201d</p><p>He caught her arm and pulled her close. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me.\u201d Not an order this time. Probably as close to a plea as the man had ever gotten. \u201cEverything is so screwed up, but shit ... I need you, Jana. More than I\u2019ve ever needed anything.\u201d</p><p>She needed him. She wanted to punch him right then, and dammit, she needed\u2014</p><p>His mouth crashed onto hers. Hot. Hard. Desperate. Wild. Just what she wanted. His tongue pushed into her mouth, drove inside and claimed her, and her heart thundered against her chest. It would be so easy, so easy to give in. But ...</p><p>But Jana pulled her mouth away from his lips. Hurt. The wound was too fresh for her to give in to the rush of lust. \u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered, letting more emotion out than she should. \u201cYou want me for sex?\u201d That wasn\u2019t enough for her anymore.</p><p>\u201cFuck, yeah, for sex, but more. \u201c There was more glittering in his eyes. \u201cGive me a chance, baby. I know I can be a dumb bastard, but give me a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me.\u201d Couldn\u2019t he see? Without trust, they didn\u2019t have anything.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t trust myself. Not with you.\u201d Stark. \u201cI want you so much, need you, that I don\u2019t trust myself.\u201d He huffed out a hard breath. \u201cYou\u2019re in me, Jana. Beneath skin and bones, and even if you had traded your fire for me ... shit, I\u2019d still need you just as much.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What? Oh, damn ... the man was making her weaken.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what powers you have. I don\u2019t care if the fire is gone.\u201d</p><p>But she thought it was coming back. She\u2019d almost felt the charge a few times. Maybe-maybe the transfer had only been temporary. Knowing Beth, she\u2019d probably killed the other paranormals who\u2019d lost their power. Hit \u2018em while they\u2019re weak ... Yeah, that was Beth\u2019s M.O. So the woman might not have even realized ...</p> <p>My fire can come back. Well, she hoped it could. If not...</p><p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d Zane said, \u201cwe\u2019ll finish this asshole out there hunting and then we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll both die.\u201d The words were as cold as the night, and too damn close.</p><p>Jana broke from Zane\u2019s hold and whirled around. Special Agent Kelly Thomas was there, pointing a gun right at them, and smiling.</p><p>Chapter 16</p> <p>Aw, hell, but she had bad luck. \u201cI don\u2019t need this now,\u201d Jana said. Zane\u2019s hands were steel tight around her. \u201cI don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I give a shit what you need?\u201d Kelly snapped at her.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take her in.\u201d Zane\u2019s voice vibrated with fury. \u201cShe\u2019s clear on those arsons. Your boss knows that. Miller isn\u2019t after her. You\u2019re supposed to be standing the fuck down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d The woman\u2019s smile looked like a shark\u2019s. \u201cThen you and the Ignitor had to go and start killing again.\u201d She shook her head but her gun didn\u2019t waver. A long, black silencer covered the end of the weapon. Not a good sign. \u201cI found that poor man\u2019s body on your porch tonight. What was his crime, hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t kill Marcus,\u201d Jana said, aware that her breath came too fast. A silencer? The agent had really gone over the edge.</p><p>\u201cMarcus.\u201d Kelly repeated the name sadly. \u201cOn a firstname basis with your victim? So you knew him, and you killed him.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was dead when I found him.\u201d Zane\u2019s thundering voice cut across Jana\u2019s words. He edged forward, placing his body between hers and the special agent\u2019s. \u201cJana didn\u2019t hurt him, and neither did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m supposed to believe that.\u201d</p><p>Guess everyone was having trouble with trust tonight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not taking her in.\u201d Zane shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s off the list. Agent Miller doesn\u2019t want her. You\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew what Miller wants. I\u2019m taking you both in.\u201d That gun still didn\u2019t waver, and Jana was real tired of it being pointed at them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try,\u201d she threw at the agent. \u201cYou really think you can take us both down?\u201d Kelly didn\u2019t know about her power loss. The agent would think she was as fire strong as always. And Zane, well, he was strong. Far stronger than the agent. \u201cYou\u2019re out of your league, Special Agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I can do,\u201d Zane said softly. \u201cDon\u2019t make me show you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a federal agent. You can\u2019t threaten me.\u201d Um, he could and had.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s voice pitched higher as she said, \u201cI\u2019m taking you both into custody until this mess is sorted out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane told her quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re not. You don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening here. You don\u2019t realize\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize some poor guy is dead on your doorstep. I know Jana\u2019s a killer, and her lover-well, it looks like he is, too.\u201d She drew in a deep, shuddering breath. \u201cCuff her.\u201d</p><p>Jana blinked. \u201cUm, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew this,\u201d Zane snarled. He was fully in front of her now, shielding her with his body. Jana felt the hot rush of his power in the air. A hard buzzing filled her ears, like a thousand bees. Her knees began to sag, and her vision blurred.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going out easily this time, demon,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cYou won\u2019t get to me so fast. You\u2019ll just take her out.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s head jerked back around, and he stared at Jana with wide eyes. Demon eyes. Eyes so dark. Eyes that had seen into her.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared for you before,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI am now. My stepbrother believed in sharing his findings with me. He studied the monsters, and he told me how to fight \u2018em.\u201d</p><p>Bitch. \u201cNot monsters,\u201d Jana managed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are. Now cuff her or I\u2019ll shoot you both.\u201d Jana couldn\u2019t see the agent, but Kelly sure sounded close. \u201cThe bullet will blast right through you, Wynter. Through you, and into her. You\u2019ll survive. Odds are good she won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Silence hummed for a moment. Then Zane was there, catching her wrist, his fingers warm around the flesh. She felt the cold bite of metal and heard the soft click of the cuff locking.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been here before,\u201d she whispered as the buzzing slowly faded from her ears. His magic cuffs. Unbreakable. Whatever happened, they\u2019d be together. The Feds wouldn\u2019t hurt him. They might want her head on a platter, but the Bureau wouldn\u2019t take out a hunter. Pak wouldn\u2019t let them.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to hurt you,\u201d he whispered, and the words feathered against her ear as he leaned in close, almost as if he were kissing her. \u201cBut I\u2019m not letting her take us out of this lot. I\u2019m taking her out.\u201d</p><p>Sounded like one fine plan to her. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll see ... how strong you are,\u201d she breathed the words back at him. Jana pressed her face into his neck and inhaled his scent.</p><p>You don\u2019t really want to see this.</p><p>The words drifted through her mind. His words.</p><p>Jana frowned. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>His fingers slid over her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Then he spun around. \u201cNow what? We\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStep to the side, demon. I want to see her face.\u201d</p><p>But Zane shook his head. \u201cNo. Put down the fucking gun. If you don\u2019t\u201d-he exhaled on a heavy breath\u2014\u201cyou\u2019ll wish you had.\u201d</p><p>Thunder echoed in Jana\u2019s ears. No, not thunder. Gunshot. The agent had shot Zane! \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>But he laughed. Laughed. And the bees were back in her head. Buzzing like crazy. The earth seemed to roll and tilt, shaking beneath her. Jana fell to the ground, and the cuffs jerked on her hand.</p><p>\u201cThat the best you got?\u201d Zane taunted. \u201cCause it\u2019s not even close to being good enough.\u201d</p><p>Rising to her knees, Jana caught a glimpse of the agent\u2019s face-right before Kelly was lifted into the air by unseen hands and tossed back five feet. She crashed into the bumper of a patrol car.</p><p>\u201cI told you to put the gun down.\u201d He took a step forward. \u201cI\u2019m done with warnings.\u201d</p><p>The ground was bucking and rolling again. Lightning streaked across the sky, and Jana grabbed tight to Zane\u2019s hand. \u201cHold on, Zane, just\u2014\u201d His blood was on the ground. Around her. Her back teeth locked. \u201cWe can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d The cop\u2019s voice. Tony barreled out of the building with his gun drawn. He took in the scene with a quick glance. Blood. Cuffs. Woman sprawled over the back of the squad car.</p><p>Kelly started laughing then. What the hell was up with the laughter?</p><p>But then Zane stumbled. His body shuddered and Jana\u2019s heart seemed to stop.</p><p>Kelly had shot him, but with what? The agent\u2019s gun lay on the ground, dropped, forgotten.</p><p>Zane lifted his right hand toward Kelly, and her laughter cut off. Her face drained of color, and she started gasping for breath. Desperate, she clawed at her throat.</p><p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d Tony said flatly. \u201cI\u2019m here, man. I\u2019ve got her. She\u2019s not going to hurt you or your lady again.\u201d</p><p>But Zane didn\u2019t let her go. Kelly\u2019s body started bucking on the car. Long, thin, bloody scratches appeared on her arms.</p><p>\u201cZane, let her go,\u201d Jana whispered, worried, really worried, for him. Because this wasn\u2019t Zane. He didn\u2019t attack this way. He took his opponent down, he didn\u2019t ... torture. She grabbed his chin, and jerked his face toward her. \u201cLet her go!\u201d</p><p>His eyes. They flickered wildly from green to black. Again. Again. \u201cZane?\u201d Fear threaded through his name.</p><p>His eyes squeezed shut. Kelly sucked in a deep, hard breath. \u201cKnew ... i-it ...\u201d she gasped.</p><p>Screw her. Jana pressed a fast kiss to his cold lips. Zane. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the bullet out, and you\u2019ll be fine. You hear me? Everything\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet away from me.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cGet. Away. \u201c His hands came between them. He tried to shove her back.</p><p>But the cuffs weren\u2019t letting her go anywhere.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the key?\u201d she whispered, but the only answer she got was the roar that burst from his lips. A roar that shook her and shattered the night.</p><p>Then the green bled totally from his eyes, leaving only the black, and Jana knew she was in trouble.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you shoot him with?\u201d The shouted words came from Tony. \u201cWhat did you use?\u201d</p><p>Jana couldn\u2019t look away from Zane. Not from that darkness.</p><p>\u201cM-my brother ... he made something sp-special for the demons.\u201d Kelly\u2019s voice was ragged, so strained, but satisfied. \u201cIt\u2019ll rip his mind apart.\u201d</p><p>Drugs. Zane\u2019s father had been lost to the drugs. He\u2019d killed Zane\u2019s mother because of his addiction. Zane hated the drugs. He\u2019d hate this.</p><p>Her left hand-the uncuffed hand-lifted and feathered over his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Just hold on.\u201d They\u2019d weathered a storm like this before. They could get through it again.</p><p>A trickle of blood slipped from his nose. He smiled at her. Not Zane\u2019s smile. Too ... cold. Too cruel.</p><p>Not like Zane.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the key?\u201d she whispered again. \u201cNot... leaving ...\u201c</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t h-have the k-key!\u201d Kelly yelled. Jana forced her stare to find the bleeding agent. Tony had a death-grip on Kelly\u2019s arm, and he was trying to cuff her. \u201cI stole it from his car while you were in-inside. H-hid it-you\u2019ll never find it!\u201d</p><p>Okay, the agent was getting on her last nerve. Feeling sorry for a woman could only last so long.</p><p>Kelly smiled at her. No, more of a baring of her teeth. \u201cHe\u2019s going to ... k-kill ... you.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath blew over Jana\u2019s neck. A shiver skated down her spine. Then his mouth pressed against her skin, and the edge of his teeth bit into her neck.</p><p>\u201cTear her f-fucking throat open!\u201d Kelly screamed.</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up!\u201d Tony roared back at her.</p><p>The bite became painful. Not a lover\u2019s nip. More. Her hands flattened on his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRip her-\u201c Kelly\u2019s words ended in a gurgle. Jana was still staring at her, and she saw the agent\u2019s eyes roll back into her head. Kelly slammed forward, breaking free of Tony\u2019s grasp and ramming her head into the cement. She didn\u2019t get up.</p><p>Zane.</p><p>He licked her neck. His head lifted, and he stared at her. Then he ripped her shirt open. With just a thought.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Tony\u2019s feet pounded toward them. \u201cMan, what are you doing? You can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tony jolted to a stop, then he flew forward, his body slamming into the thick concrete wall. Like a puppet on a string.</p><p>Not Zane. Not her Zane. This wasn\u2019t him. \u201dNo!\u201d Her scream echoed in that cold night. \u201cZane, stop!\u201d</p><p>This time, he was the one to laugh, and that laughter chilled her to the bone. The good guy was totally gone. The demon was in charge, and he was staring at her with blood-lust in his eyes.</p><p>He\u2019s going to k-kill you.</p><p>Oh, damn, it sure looked like he just might.</p><p>Jude Donovan caught the scent of blood in the air. It was a scent that called to him, that tempted him, and one that made the beast inside salivate. Catalina was in sight, and even though the witch was all but flying down the street, she wouldn\u2019t be able to get away from him. He was faster.</p><p>But that blood ... He turned his head a bit. The scent came from behind him. His nostrils flared. Back to the left.</p><p>Where he\u2019d left Zane and his Ignitor.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>He cast one final glance at Catalina. She was running as if wolves were after her. Or maybe as if a tiger shifter were on her tail. Smart woman.</p><p>The blood.</p><p>The tiger inside roared, and so did the man. He spun away and thundered back down the road, running after that sweet smell, sucking it deep inside, and pounding across the pavement as he raced back to Zane and Jana.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>He cut through an alley. Jude came up in the back of the squat, cement building, and he saw Tony ram into the wall.</p><p>Jude\u2019s fangs burned in his mouth and his claws burst out. Tony might be an ass sometimes, but nobody hurt his friend, not even\u2014</p><p>Zane. Shit.</p><p>Jude snapped his teeth together. No, no, this wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cFight it,\u201d he heard Jana say, her hands tight on the demon. Were they handcuffed together? Again? \u201cI know the drugs are strong, but you can do this, you can.\u201d</p><p>Drugs. No, no, Zane and drugs did not mix. The guy never even touched a cigarette because he was too afraid of the addiction, and of the darkness that the addiction brought.</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d he barked out his name, hoping to get his friend\u2019s attention.</p><p>Zane\u2019s body stiffened. Jude felt a rush of hot wind against his body, and he clenched his muscles. Zane\u2019s head turned toward him, a slow, gliding move, almost like a snake\u2019s. Those eyes ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, dammit. Jude stepped forward. If I ever turn like my old man, kill me. Zane\u2019s quiet voice from so long ago. A late night at Delaney\u2019s bar when secrets had come out. Secrets about drugs, demons, and death. Promise me, you\u2019ll hunt me.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jana screamed just as that hot wind rushed against Jude again. This time, that wind picked Jude up like he was a rag doll, and he hurtled through the air. Fuck, fuck, fuck. He lifted his arms and protected his head right before his body thudded into the concrete wall at the back of the building.</p><p>\u201cNo, Zane! Stop, he\u2019s your friend!\u201d</p> <p>But Zane wasn\u2019t gonna be stopping. Didn\u2019t she realize? Zane wasn\u2019t in control right then.</p><p>I-I never want to be like him. Him. Zane\u2019s father. The murdering bastard who had slaughtered Zane\u2019s mother.</p><p>The tiger snarled inside as the shift pressed ever closer. It would be so easy to change. To let that burning fire of the tiger consume him. Attack. Kill. Protect.</p><p>But if he shifted ... he and Zane ... dammit, one of them wouldn\u2019t survive.</p><p>The hot rush of air came at him again.</p> <p>One of them might not survive now. Jude\u2019s claws scraped across the cement as he shoved back to his feet. His gaze darted to the left. To the long, thick metal pole that secured the side of that trash bin.</p><p>\u201cZane! Don\u2019t hurt him! Listen to me, listen ... \u201d</p><p>The demon wouldn\u2019t listen. The demon would destroy. Trapped to him, bound by those cuffs, the woman was helpless. Unless she used her fire.</p><p>Why the hell hadn\u2019t she used her fire?</p><p>The same reason I haven\u2019t used my tiger.</p><p>Because this was Zane.</p> <p>His fingers wrapped around that bar. Zane was kissing the woman, holding her tight, caging her body against his even as his power filled the air. He\u2019d never seen the demon let loose so much energy. Lightning crackled across the sky and streaked far too close to earth. Too close to Zane.</p><p>The metal screamed as Jude ripped it free. He saw Zane tense at the sound, saw him try to jerk up, but Jana grabbed him and held tight. \u201cDon\u2019t let me go!\u201d She held the demon\u2019s head in her hands. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>She was all the distraction he needed. Jude lunged forward and slammed the bar into the back of Zane\u2019s head.</p><p>When Zane fell, he took her to the ground with him. Gasping, shuddering, Jana hit hard and her body shrieked a protest back at her.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes were closed, and his black lashes cast shadows on his cheeks. \u201cZane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be out long.\u201d The hunter. Jude. He\u2019d gotten up fast. He grabbed for the handcuffs and tried to yank them apart.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d she whispered, feathering her fingers over Zane\u2019s face. \u201cYou know they\u2019re enchanted. The agent took the key. Without it ...\u201d She let the sentence trail off. He knew what would happen. There\u2019d be no separating her from Zane.</p><p>Not that she planned to leave him. Not now.</p> <p>He\u2019d tried to tell her to leave, before the drugs swept through him. Tried to warn her away.</p><p>Why? So he could face the darkness alone?</p><p>Jude dropped her hand and ran for Kelly. He pulled the agent up. Jana saw her head dip and sag. Jude drove his hands in the pockets of her jeans.</p><p>Jana shook her head. The agent was too smart to have just pocketed the keys. She\u2019d planned this too well.</p><p>He\u2019ll k-kill you.</p><p>The agent had planned, all right. She probably thought it was the perfect ending for Jana. Killed by her lover.</p><p>Jana\u2019s fingers curled around Zane\u2019s arms. \u201cHelp me.\u201d</p><p>The shifter kept struggling with the agent\u2019s limp body. Thanks to that header into the concrete, Kelly would be out for a long time. Too long.</p><p>But Zane ... he healed fast. She licked her lips. \u201dHelp me.\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s head snapped toward her. She caught a glimpse of his fangs. His claws. Jana could clearly see the indecision on his face. He thought she wanted him to attack Zane.</p><p>Jude shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cWe have to secure him.\u201d Her fingers were light on Zane\u2019s flesh. \u201cHe\u2019s going to wake up soon.\u201d A few minutes. If she knew her demons, and she did know them pretty well, he\u2019d probably be out no more than five minutes, tops. While he was out, the drug would finish pumping through his body. When he woke up ... She swallowed. \u201cWe need a room he can\u2019t escape. He can\u2019t be near anyone. He\u2019ll ... hurt them.\u201d</p><p>Kill.</p><p>She rose and struggled to pull Zane with her. \u201dHelp me,\u201d she said again, and this time, the shifter was there. He grabbed Zane and hoisted him up.</p><p>Tony groaned as he began to rouse. Still alive. Good. For a minute there, she hadn\u2019t been so sure.</p><p>The shifter tossed Zane over his shoulder and carried him easily. Jana stumbled right behind them, the handcuffs pulling her in their wake. They went back inside. Down to the basement.</p><p>\u201cA normal room isn\u2019t going to work. He\u2019ll be able to get out, he\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis used to be a psych hospital, before the city took the building.\u201d Jude entered a room to the right. No windows. Thick walls.</p><p>\u201cThe door is reinforced steel. It only locks from the outside.\u201d</p><p>He lowered Zane to the floor. Jana slid down to his side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you in here with him.\u201d Jude\u2019s eyes were too bright, glittering. I can see the beast he carries so clearly now.</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d Her words sounded confident, almost cocky. With those shifter senses, though, she bet the guy could hear how fast her heart was racing. Could he even smell her fear? \u201cLock us in. Then go find the witch. She can break the cuffs.\u201d Not that Jana planned to leave him, even then.</p><p>Jude eyed the door, and then looked back at her. \u201cNo damn way that lock will hold him. Zane is strong. He\u2019ll blast right through it.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers intertwined with his. Still out. \u201cThen send Tony after the witch. You stand guard on the other side of the door. But you don\u2019t come at him, you hear me? Not unless ...\u201d</p><p>Unless, what? Unless Zane attacked him? Like he\u2019d done just minutes before.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt him,\u201d Jude said. Might as well be her own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want him to hurt you.\u201d She didn\u2019t want Zane to attack anyone, especially not his friends. Stronger than I\u2019d thought. And, yes, it sure seemed like her demon had a very dark side. No wonder he kept that side leashed.</p><p>\u201cYour fire ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no good.\u201d Like she\u2019d ever use the flames on Zane. The bastard might have pissed her off before because he didn\u2019t know how to trust, but he was still ... Zane.</p><p>And his eyelids began to flutter. If he saw the shifter, he\u2019d go into instant attack mode. \u201cGet out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave you with him, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him and made her voice drip ice as she said, \u201cDo you really think I need protecting?\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t take the bait. His lips tightened. \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>Almost sweet. But they didn\u2019t have time for sweet. \u201cIf he sees you, he\u2019ll try to rip you apart.\u201d Her heart slammed into her ribs. \u201cI\u2019ll keep him calm, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d A groan broke from Zane\u2019s lips. \u201cJust go!\u201d</p><p>Jude eased back a step. One. Another. \u201cI\u2019ll be on the other side of that door.\u201d Making sure no one entered-no one who could get hurt, she knew. And making sure, also, that Zane wouldn\u2019t get out. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be able to hear everything. If he attacks you, I\u2019m coming in.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, the movement jerky and hard. Fair enough. If Zane started psychically tossing her around the room\u2014like he\u2019d tossed the others outside-she\u2019d want the shifter\u2019s backup.</p><p>But Zane wasn\u2019t going to hurt her. I trust you, even if you can\u2019t trust me.</p><p>Jude hurried out and shut the door. The bolt slammed into place with a clang.</p><p>Jana crawled on top of Zane and straddled him. What drug had Kelly given him? Something my brother made... Hell, that could be anything! In those few days that Brent had held her in his lab, she\u2019d learned he\u2019d liked to play God, stirring and mixing and creating torments for his \u201cexperiments.\u201d</p><p>The last time Zane had been hit with a drug, he\u2019d wanted her. Sex and fury could be a potent combination. Sex and fury. He\u2019d pulled back. The man had fought the demon\u2019s pull. Because of his hybrid blood? Had he been able to fight the drug because his body chemistry was so different? Or had he just been strong enough, because, shit, he was strong?</p><p>No more time to think-his eyelids flashed open. Pitch-black eyes stared up at her. He bucked beneath her and nearly sent her right onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d She leaned down close. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d Liar, liar. She sealed her mouth to his.</p><p>His tongue thrust past her lips, and his hand clamped over her hip. His erection rose, long and thick, against her.</p><p>Zane. She called his name in her mind and wondered if he would hear her on the link they\u2019d used before. Would the drug amp up his psychic power? Would it let him in\u2014</p><p>An image flashed in her mind. Her. Him. On this same dirty floor. She was on top of him, and he was thrusting his thick cock into her.</p><p>She gasped into his mouth right at the moment she felt his hand yank open the snap of her jeans.</p><p>\u201cJana!\u201d Jude\u2019s bellow.</p><p>Her head shot up. Zane stared at her, nostrils flaring, cheeks flushed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d she yelled back. \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d</p><p>But Zane was growling. His hands were on her jeans. Shoving them down and the damn cuffs were in the way and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming in!\u201d Jude told her.</p><p>Zane\u2019s head whipped toward the door. The bees buzzed in her head again, and the sexy image faded. A red haze seemed to cloak her vision. Her vision, or Zane\u2019s?</p><p>\u201cNo, stay back!\u201d</p><p>She grabbed Zane\u2019s chin. \u201cStay with me,\u201d she whispered to him and kissed him again. Stay with me. That psychic link between them was there, and Zane was using it. She just wasn\u2019t sure the demon knew it.</p><p>Jana kicked out of her shoes and ditched her jeans. He ripped her panties, shredding them. His hand bit into her hip. Too hard. Too strong.</p><p>\u201cZane...\u201d</p><p>He yanked down his zipper. His cock sprang free. As wide as her wrist, head bulging, moisture already beading from that tip.</p><p>His cock pushed into her, drove inside, and she shuddered against him.</p><p>No. Jana shook her head. Hadn\u2019t happened yet. Just another vision, one coming from him, hadn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>He rolled her beneath him. The hard floor pressed into her back. He pushed her legs apart and positioned that cock right at the entrance to her body. No foreplay. No caresses, no\u2014</p><p>Flesh to flesh. She only had a second to process that fact, then Zane thrust into her, a long hard drive that had her crying out.</p><p>He blinked, and his eyes narrowed. \u201cJ-Jana ...\u201d His voice was hoarse, confused. A flash of green appeared near the edges of his irises. \u201cWhat the fuck ... am I do\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her legs locked around him. \u201cFucking me.\u201d Now that the shock had worn off, her body was adjusting, fast. Her inner muscles clamped around him.</p><p>\u201cS-sorry...\u201d Sweat beaded his brows. \u201cC-can\u2019t... stop ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to.\u201d She arched her hips against him. \u201cI want you to move.\u201d</p><p>The green bled away. Only black again. Such darkness in her lover\u2019s eyes. Such hot darkness.</p><p>His cock pulled out of her, a rough slide of flesh. The cuffs banged against the floor as he held her arms. Then he drove into her, again, again. Hard, plunging thrusts that had her moaning, gasping, and shoving up against him because the pleasure was so intense.</p><p>He bit her, right where her neck curved into her shoulder. A bite that didn\u2019t break the flesh, but made her arch beneath him. More. His hips rocked against her, and he thrust into her, slamming all the way to her core.</p><p>His tongue licked the light wound he\u2019d made. A moan rumbled in his throat. Hell, maybe in hers. Her flesh was so sensitive that every fierce stroke had her tensing. And wanting more.</p><p>His cock swelled within her, thickening even more, and she started to come. Jana choked out his name as her climax hit and the flames burned through her.</p><p>Zane pumped into her. Her sex was slick and eager now. Withdraw. Thrust. The slap of their bodies filled the room, and the scent of sex surrounded her.</p><p>More.</p><p>She could have sworn he whispered the word, but his mouth was still on her neck. Licking, sucking.</p><p>His hips pistoned against her. Her sex squeezed him as the after-shocks of pleasure trembled inside her.</p><p>His hand jerked down, yanking those cuffs. Her shirt still gaped open. He yanked her bra up and his mouth closed around her right nipple.</p><p>Zane!</p><p>Her sex clamped around him.</p><p>His tongue traced the nipple, and then he started to suck. And to fuck.</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>See me. See us. His voice.</p><p>And she saw them. With her eyes closed, she saw the fast thrust of his cock into her sex. The withdrawal. The thrust.</p><p>He sent the images into her mind, and the pleasure seemed to intensify. More. More.</p><p>From him? Her?</p><p>More. She\u2019d take it. Take everything. Take him.</p><p>The second climax had her breath catching and her heart racing. She held on to him as tightly as she could. Hard enough to bruise.</p><p>He drove into her once more, then stiffened. The hot splash of his release filled her and she heard him gasp her name.</p><p>Jana\u2019s eyes opened. In pleasure, his face was so beautiful. So perfect. A lump rose in her throat.</p><p>And they\u2019d done it. We beat you, Agent Thomas. Zane hadn\u2019t turned on her. Hadn\u2019t attacked. A smile began to curl her lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then his hand rose and wrapped around her neck.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Catalina threw another fast glance over her shoulder. No one was back there. She\u2019d ditched Jude. How the hell did I do that? Her stomach clenched. You didn\u2019t lose a tiger shifter unless he let you lose him.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you going, Catalina?\u201d At the sound of that soft, feminine voice, Catalina\u2019s blood froze. She\u2019d known when she came back to Baton Rouge with Logan in tow that this meeting would be coming, only a matter of time.</p><p>Slowly, carefully, she turned to face the woman she\u2019d once considered a friend.</p><p>Sandra \u201cDee\u201d Daniels stood in the shadows, her small body almost completely hidden. There was a slight shuffle of footsteps, then Dee stepped forward. Her blond hair was cut haphazardly around her face.</p><p>Normally, Dee would have flashed her a wide smile. They would have gone out for drinks. Talked smack about men. Maybe exchanged some secrets. But that was all in the past. \u201cJude sent you after me,\u201d Catalina said with certainty. But Dee shook her head. \u201cNo, Tony did.\u201d Ah, Tony. Figured. He and Dee had a ... pretty intimate past. Of course, that was back in the days before Dee had changed.</p><p>Dee smiled now. Only it wasn\u2019t the one Catalina had wanted to see. It was a new, harder smile, one that revealed Dee\u2019s fangs.</p> <p>From vampire hunter to vampire all in a few short days ... yes, Dee\u2019s life had changed. That change had been one of the things that sent Catalina running from the city.</p><p>Dee offered her hand, palm up. \u201cI\u2019m going to need you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>Catalina shook her head. No, no, she had to go and see about Logan. He was weak, and he\u2019d need her help to get out of Baton Rouge. Especially with someone from Perseus still hunting them.</p><p>\u201cI can see the bite marks on your neck,\u201d Dee told her. \u201cAnd I can almost feel the guy in the air around you.\u201d</p><p>Dee wasn\u2019t your average vampire. She hadn\u2019t been Taken, the term for the humans who were transformed by a blood exchange with a vampire. No, Dee was so much more. Born, not made. A vampire who hadn\u2019t even realized her true power until death came calling.</p><p>And she sent the asshole packing.</p> <p>\u201cW-we\u2019re being hunted, Dee,\u201d Catalina said. \u201cWe have to get out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning?\u201d Again? The unspoken word hung between them.</p><p>Catalina kept her chin up. Dee didn\u2019t understand. She didn\u2019t know what it was like to be weak. To see the fire and know it was going to burn your skin away while you screamed.</p><p>Catalina spun away-and slammed into Dee. She\u2019d never seen the woman move. Wouldn\u2019t have, not with Dee\u2019s power. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me,\u201d Dee told her and grabbed her wrist.</p><p>Catalina blinked back tears. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne spell is all I need, Cat. One spell, then you ... and your vampire ... can get out of town.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cY-you\u2019ll... let him go?\u201d</p><p>Dee held her gaze. \u201cUnless he goes after humans, he\u2019s off my radar.\u201d</p> <p>But he\u2019d gone after the Ignitor. He\u2019d been desperate, starving. Did Dee know what he\u2019d done? Catalina would need to keep Logan away from Zane so the demon wouldn\u2019t come for his revenge.</p><p>Only a matter of time.</p><p>Catalina forced herself to nod. \u201cOkay.\u201d It was the only deal she\u2019d be getting. Better take it, grab it with both hands, and hold as tight as she could. \u201cI don\u2019t have much power.\u201d Painful to admit, but her binding marks weren\u2019t fading yet. And why not? They should have vanished when Beth died. Beth had been the one in charge at Perseus. The one to trap her and to use her. Why haven\u2019t they faded?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll have to be enough.\u201d Dee pushed her toward a car idling near the curb. Catalina sucked in a breath when she saw the driver. Simon. Dee\u2019s vampire lover.</p><p>The two were a perfect killing team.</p><p>\u201cWho needs my spell?\u201d she asked, suddenly very worried as she climbed inside the vehicle.</p><p>Dee jumped in behind her and the car door slammed.</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>The last thing she\u2019d expected. \u201cZane? Why?\u201d Simon floored the gas.</p><p>\u201cBecause someone pumped the poor bastard full of drugs.\u201d Dee sighed. \u201cAnd we both know what can happen to him when the drugs get into his system.\u201d</p><p>Goose bumps rose on Catalina\u2019s arms. Yes, she knew. And, once, long ago, she\u2019d seen. Scrying. He\u2019d always asked her not to do it. But the future teased and taunted, and she\u2019d had to know.</p><p>Zane ... eyes black as the night. Face bloody. The earth bucking beneath him. Death ... a shroud he carried. One look, one touch, the prey fell before him.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d she whispered to Simon and, when he looked up into the rearview mirror, she saw his jaw clench. \u201dHurry.\u201d</p><p>Jana\u2019s breath caught as she stared up at Zane. His face could have been carved from fire and fury. Such hard, fierce lines. And his hand, as it wrapped around her neck ...</p><p>\u201cI... hurt... you.\u201d Gravel rough. Like the man was struggling to speak. Maybe he was.</p><p>She realized his fingers were feathering over the bite mark on her neck. He was worried about that? Jana couldn\u2019t help it. She laughed. A quick, light gurgle of sound.</p><p>He blinked at her.</p><p>\u201cZane, trust me, you\u2019ve got worse marks on you.\u201d Because she hadn\u2019t been gentle at the end. Her nails had dug into him and held tight.</p><p>\u201c Should ... have ... run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She curled her fingers around the steely muscles of his arms. \u201cBut you know I don\u2019t ever do what I should do.\u201d</p><p>The bees began to buzz in the back of her mind. \u201cGo ...\u201d She glanced down at the cuffs. \u201cCan\u2019t, remember?\u201d His gaze followed hers. Those bees got louder. Louder ... The cuffs broke apart. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>Those all-powerful, unbreakable cuffs fell to the floor. He pushed against her, his cock still thick and swollen, and the move seemed almost helpless. More, please.</p><p>But then he pulled away, sliding out of her, and jumping to his feet. \u201cLeave...\u201d Still that gravel-rough voice. \u201dWhile you ... can.\u201d He yanked up his jeans.</p><p>Jana licked her lips. Tasted him. She swallowed and wondered what the hell she should do. What did a woman have to say to make a man understand she wasn\u2019t the kind to wilt when things got tough?</p><p>Slowly, she rose to her feet. She took a few fast moments to dress, to adjust her clothes, and felt the aches and tingles in her body as she moved. Then she faced him with her legs braced apart and her chin up. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>But he shook his head. \u201cWill...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She was certain. \u201cYou\u2019re stronger than whatever that agent pumped into you. You\u2019re the strongest man I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d True.</p><p>\u201cNot ...man...\u201d</p><p>He was right. So much more than just a man. \u201cYou\u2019re not like your father.\u201d</p><p>His teeth snapped together and the floor seemed to roll. Good thing she\u2019d locked her knees. She\u2019d figured that was coming. \u201cYou\u2019re not your father, and I\u2019m not your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeak ... human.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he just had to throw that in her face, right?</p><p>\u201cZane, trust me. We can do this, together.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, his powerful body shaking, and in that instant, she really thought that she might be getting through to him. Breaking past the darkness and getting to the man.</p><p>Then she smelled the smoke.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cZane ...\u201d</p><p>She saw his nostrils flare as he caught the scent and then he was running for the door. Just as he reached out to grab it, the door swung open. Jude was there, filling the doorway. His claws were out.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Don\u2019t attack, don\u2019t!</p><p>Zane\u2019s fingers wrapped around the shifter\u2019s throat. Jude\u2019s claws pressed against Zane\u2019s stomach. \u201cDemon,\u201d Jude growled, \u201cyou in control?\u201d</p><p>Zane gave the barest of nods.</p><p>The claws dropped. \u201cGood. Cause we need to get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t free the shifter. Jana saw his fingers whiten as he tightened his hold. She sprang forward and caught Zane\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLet him go.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s fingers fell away. Her breath heaved out. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? What\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFire.\u201d Jude bit out the word even as he whirled away. \u201cComing fast. We need to get up a level and get out.\u201d</p><p>She gave a quick nod, but he didn\u2019t see it. The shifter was already racing away. No, he was shifting. Out in the hallway. She heard the crackle and hiss of the flames, but she also heard a roar. Like ... a tiger\u2019s roar.</p><p>She ran to the doorway. Jude was on all fours, with his head down. As she watched, fur exploded along his body. Bones snapped, popped. Elongated and reshaped. The man disappeared and a tiger-holy hell, one big white tiger-appeared in his place.</p><p>Another roar seemed to shake the building, then the tiger launched forward as its giant body soared through the air.</p><p>Jana sucked in a deep breath. Then one more. White tiger. She\u2019d never seen a shift like that before. Sure, she\u2019d heard about them, but she hadn\u2019t actually seen someone transform. Oh, damn. Oh, shit.</p><p>\u201cFire\u2019s... stronger....\u201d Zane\u2019s voice muttered in her ear. \u201cGo...\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to be told twice. Jana ran after the tiger, with Zane at her side. They thundered up the stairs. Smoke billowed in the air, choking her, and stinging her eyes.</p><p>The stairwell exit door was broken and hung drunkenly open. Thanks, no doubt, to the tiger. They went through the doorway and seemed to step into hell. Fire-everywhere. Burning so bright and hot.</p><p>There was no way to get out. The flames were too strong. The exits were blocked. The windows covered by the flames. How? How had the blaze gotten so strong? Not a normal fire. No way. This one was definitely\u2014</p><p>Zane shoved his hands forward, as if he were pushing against something. The flames rolled back, rolled, then sputtered, dying low before the windows. The tiger crouched, then leapt forward, easily breaking through the glass.</p><p>Jana ran after him, only to be pulled back by Zane. \u201cWait, what are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He picked her up, tucked her head against his chest, and flew through the window. The glass had to cut him, but the guy didn\u2019t even grunt, and he landed on his feet\u2014on his feet. His knees barely buckled as they touched down outside. Then he was running away from the burning building with her held tight in his arms.</p><p>Her hands dug into him. \u201cZane ... is ... is anyone else inside?\u201d</p><p>He froze.</p><p>Humans worked there. Sure, it was nearing three a.m., but someone should have been inside. Guards. Attendants. Someone.</p><p>And that fire was burning so hot now.</p><p>He put her on her feet. Spun back around. The tiger was pacing, growling.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Tony?\u201d she asked, coughing a bit to clear her lungs as she looked to the left, then the right. The lot was deserted. \u201cAnd the agent, where is she?\u201d</p><p>Were they in the building?</p><p>Zane sprinted forward. The tiger attacked. Its paws slammed into Zane\u2019s chest, and he knocked Zane back.</p><p>Snarling, Zane leapt, his eyes on the building. Once more, that tiger came at him, swiping this time with his claws. A long, hard swipe that drew blood across Zane\u2019s chest.</p><p>A hot wind blew against her face. The bees ...</p><p>\u201c No!\u201d She grabbed Zane. \u201cHe\u2019s a shifter. He\u2019d smell people if they were inside.\u201d But Jude was doing everything he could to keep Zane out of that building. Because no one was inside? Because if Zane went back in, he wouldn\u2019t be coming out?</p><p>Zane shook her off and lunged forward once more. He caught the tiger\u2019s front paws, holding them tight, and didn\u2019t even flinch under the cat\u2019s great weight.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d A woman\u2019s startled cry. \u201cZane, Jude, get away from there!\u201d</p><p>Because they had gotten too close to the flames. The flames that had shot even higher, even brighter.</p><p>In the distance, a siren began to wail. Hell.</p><p>The woman rushed toward Zane and Jude. Wait, was she crazy? Was she really going to try and get between a demon and a tiger? The lady was small. Freaking tiny, with really bad hair. Blond, but cut oh-so-badly. And she was cursing. Swearing constantly under her breath.</p><p>\u201cDee!\u201d a man bellowed. But that call came too late. \u201cDee\u201d had already gotten to the two fighters. She punched the tiger in the side. Hard.</p><p>He roared and turned toward her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think of biting me,\u201d she yelled at him, snapping her teeth together. Her incredibly sharp teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll bite back.\u201d Vampire.</p><p>So was the dark, dangerous man who ran after her. Jana caught sight of his fangs glinting in the dark.</p><p>No, not more vampires.</p><p>Jana\u2019s hand rose to her neck, and her fingers pressed lightly against the still tender skin. A shiver skated over her body. Her heart already raced too fast, and the desperate beat began to shake her chest.</p><p>Vampires. Near Zane. Closing in ...</p><p>Her hands clenched into fists.</p><p>\u201cTake care of him!\u201d Dee ordered her vamp friend. The male grabbed Zane\u2019s arms and held them behind the demon\u2019s back.</p><p>Zane immediately head-butted the guy. Blood poured from the vamp\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cShit! It\u2019s me, Zane, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you shift back already?\u201d Dee shouted at Jude as Jana stared at them, rage and fear twisting inside her.</p><p>Can\u2019t just stand here. Can\u2019t let them hurt Zane.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s charging up.\u201d What? Another freaking voice? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jana turned her head, just a bit, and saw the witch walk into the back lot. Catalina.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s charging up,\u201d Catalina said again, \u201cand she\u2019s going to attack.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t charge up. That wasn\u2019t fire spiking her blood. It was plain old fury. But the vamps didn\u2019t know that. \u201cGet away from Zane!\u201d She wanted her fire back!</p> <p>At her words, Zane twisted and drove his fist into the male vamp\u2019s bloody face. The vamp flew back ten feet.</p><p>\u201cUh, oh.\u201d Dee shook her head and turned her back on the shifter. \u201cGuessing this is why you\u2019re still in tiger form.\u201d</p><p>Because Zane was amped up, almost wild? Unstoppable. The blonde\u2019s gaze returned to Jana. Black irises-a vampire in hunting mode. Jana\u2019s vision began to narrow.</p><p>Dee held up her hands. \u201cI\u2019m here to help him, not hurt him.\u201d</p><p>Right. Like any vamp was there to help. She\u2019d tried to help that other vamp in the swamp, and he\u2019d literally bitten the hand that reached to help.</p> <p>Zane launched at the tiger. They fell to the ground, rolling. Oh, damn. The tiger\u2019s teeth were so close to Zane\u2019s throat. Then Zane twisted and threw the tiger against a car.</p><p>\u201cHelp me.\u201c The vampire-Dee-her voice was so deep and compelling. It seemed to slip right under Jana\u2019s skin. To slip inside ...</p><p>No. Jana\u2019s body tensed. \u201cHe just wants to get inside, to make sure no one else is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else is in the building. Jude would\u2019ve smelled \u2018em. That death trap was for you and Zane.\u201d Dee marched closer to her. \u201cCall him off.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhat? I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she can,\u201d came from Catalina and the witch began to close in on her, too.</p> <p>\u201cCall. Him. Off,\u201d Dee repeated. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to have to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>Jana\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou think you can?\u201d Right then, she didn\u2019t think anyone could stop him. The tiger\u2019s claws didn\u2019t even come close to his flesh now. He moved too fast, and he seemed far too strong.</p><p>But the male vamp was on his feet and heading forward with his hands up.</p><p>\u201cNo, Zane!\u201d</p><p>Zane spun toward her, and Dee grabbed her. For a small chick, she was damn strong. Too strong.</p><p>\u201cCome away from the building, Zane.\u201d Dee\u2019s soft order.</p><p>More sirens. The cops and firefighters would be there any minute.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get the hell out of here, and I need you to focus, got me, demon?\u201d The woman\u2019s claws were at her throat. That rage and fear spiked again in Jana\u2019s blood.</p> <p>\u201cDee ...\u201d Catalina\u2019s shaking voice. \u201cYou, um, need to be very care\u2014\u201d</p><p>The vampire screamed and dropped her hold. Jana spun around and saw that Dee was clutching her hand. A hand that was smoking. Yes, oh, yes. The fire\u2019s back! She was back!</p><p>Jana\u2019s lips began to curve. Then the male vamp tackled her. Jana\u2019s head thudded into the ground and the world disappeared in a curtain of black.</p><p>Jana was on the ground. Not moving. A man had her in his arms. He said, \u201cOh, fuck\u2014\u201d just as Zane launched at him.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The blond female was there again. Glaring up at him with her vampire eyes. \u201cZane, she\u2019s okay, but we have to get out of here! Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arms. Everything was too loud. Too dark. The fire seemed to call him, and Jana-Jana was the only constant in his world.</p><p>Eyes closed. Unmoving. Vamp holding her.</p><p>This had happened before. He wasn\u2019t going to let her be hurt again.</p><p>He shoved the blonde aside.</p><p>\u201cShit, Zane!\u201d And she was back, grabbing him. Shaking him. Strong for someone so small. \u201dIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Her voice seemed distorted, echoing almost. He frowned and studied that face. He ... knew her.</p><p>\u201cDee. It\u2019s Dee.\u201d Her head turned to the left. \u201cDammit, shift already, Jude! Don\u2019t you hear those sirens? We\u2019ve got like five seconds to scram.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. Dee. The name clicked in his mind. She was ...</p><p>\u201cTell me you remember me.\u201d She stared up at him. \u201cI\u2019ve only been working with you at Night Watch forever. It\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Dee. Sandra Dee.</p><p>Vampire.</p><p>He broke free of her hold. The male vamp lifted his hands, but didn\u2019t attack. Jana\u2019s head lay cradled in his lap. \u201cShe hit her head. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d The vamp broke off, swallowing.</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t want her to hurt Dee.\u201d</p><p>The fury was easing inside Zane. No, not easing. He felt like he was about to crash. His heartbeat slowed, and his breathing roughened. He took Jana, hoisted her into his arms, and held tight.</p><p>Get away. They had to leave because of the\u2014</p><p>Sirens. For some reason, a reason he couldn\u2019t remember right then, Jana didn\u2019t like sirens. She didn\u2019t want to be around cops.</p><p>He held her tighter. Zane inhaled her scent and started running away. No, not running. Barely walking. His legs didn\u2019t want to move. Holding Jana seemed so hard.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d He looked up when he heard the woman\u2019s soft voice. An angel stood before him, her long, blond hair feathering around her pale face. \u201cYou\u2019re safe,</p><p>Zane.\u201d</p><p>Those were the last words he heard before his knees buckled and he fell onto the ground, pulling Jana down with him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re being hunted.\u201d The voice drifted through the fog that surrounded him.</p><p>Zane tensed at that voice. One so important to him. She\u2019s okay. If Jana was talking, then that meant she was all right.</p><p>He tried to open his eyes. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She was all right, but what the hell was wrong with him?</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s after you?\u201d Another feminine voice, but sharper, harder.</p><p>\u201cSomeone from Perseus.\u201d A pause, then Jana said, \u201cAt least, that\u2019s what the witch said. I-I\u2019m worried ... have we heard from the cop, from Tony?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cHe was outside that building. He would have seen whoever set the fire.\u201d Jude\u2019s voice now. \u201cI saw him, before ... He came to find me inside. I told him to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo send me after Catalina,\u201d Dee said. Yes, Dee. That sharp voice was hers.</p><p>Jude\u2019s snarl hung in the air. \u201cTony wouldn\u2019t have just left us to burn.\u201d</p><p>Zane tried to open his eyes again. Nothing. He tried to lift his hands, but couldn\u2019t move. What the fuck? What had the drug done to him?</p><p>\u201cPak\u2019s got a search on for him,\u201d Dee said. \u201cFor him and Agent Thomas.\u201d</p><p>A soft sigh drifted in the air. \u201cTony was there the night Perseus went up in flames.\u201d Jana\u2019s words came slowly as if she hated to say, \u201cCatalina said we were all marked for death. What if he\u2019s been taken by Perseus?\u201d</p><p>No. His hand jerked, hard, and Zane felt something snap.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jude drawled the word. A long whistle filled the air. \u201cOur demon just broke a steel restraint. I\u2019d say he\u2019s coming back to us.\u201d</p><p>Soft fingers wrapped around his. \u201cZane?\u201d Jana whispered. \u201cYou coming back?\u201d</p><p>Open damn eyes, open. Because he needed to see her.</p><p>Jana.</p><p>Light filled his vision. Too bright. Then she was there, leaning over him, that dark curtain of hair surrounding her face, a blue-and-black bruise high on her forehead.</p><p>The other restraint broke as he shoved upright.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he noticed the bruise,\u201d Dee murmured. \u201cSee, told you it was a good idea to station Simon outside.\u201d</p><p>Simon. Dee\u2019s lover. The vamp he remembered tackling Jana. His teeth snapped together.</p><p>\u201cAre you really back this time?\u201d she asked softly as her brows pulled together.</p><p>This time? Just what the hell had been going on?</p><p>He reached for her and skimmed the back of his hand down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d His voice grated, but she didn\u2019t wince. Didn\u2019t so much as look away from him.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Her lips tried to curl, that dimple peeking at him, and she blinked quickly. For an instant, Zane could have sworn that he saw the glint of tears in Jana\u2019s eyes.</p><p>She\u2019d stayed with him. He remembered that. The blood-lust had burned inside, and she\u2019d stayed. She\u2019d let him\u2014</p><p>Zane sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cBaby ...\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and kissed him. A soft, fast press of her lips. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d Dee grumbled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt her. You weren\u2019t even close to hurting her. It was anyone dumb enough to get between the two of you that you decided to hurt.\u201d</p><p>That was damn good news. No, it was fucking fabulous news.</p><p>Jana tried to ease away. He caught the back of her head and pulled her close, and he kissed her the way he needed to. Deep and long, tasting and taking, and promising so much more to come.</p><p>\u201cAw, hell.\u201d The frustrated sigh was pure Dee. \u201cCan\u2019t you get a room once we\u2019re done figuring out who is trying to destroy you? You know, we\u2019ve got the little matter of someone setting a fire to kill you, and your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Zane lifted his head. He could taste Jana on his lips now. Just what he wanted. \u201cNo one was trying to kill us with the fire.\u201d He turned his head and saw Dee\u2019s face tense.</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone trapped us so Tony would be easy prey.\u201d The knowledge pissed him off. \u201cThis guy is doing up-close and personal kills. Slicing throats, not burning prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe he changed his M.O.\u201d Jude crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cBecause that fire was damn wild. If you hadn\u2019t calmed it down ...\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d always had a way with the fire. Jana twined her fingers with his.</p><p>\u201cWe have to find Tony,\u201d Dee said, voice fierce. \u201cThe guy\u2019s pretty much freaking helpless. He\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman?\u201d Jana finished quietly. Then she shook her head. \u201cJust because we\u2019re human, it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, I wasn\u2019t making that mistake about you.\u201d Dee\u2019s blond brows rose. \u201cNot making that mistake at all.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned, struggling to shove the last of the fog from his mind. His temples throbbed as he demanded, \u201cHow much time has passed?\u201d</p><p>Jude exhaled. \u201cToo damn much.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cYou were out an hour. I tried to pick up Tony\u2019s scent from the scene, but\u2014\u201d His shoulders lifted, then fell in a hard shrug. \u201cIt was like the guy had never been there.\u201d</p><p>Someone strong was jerking them around. \u201cThe claw marks were like a wolf\u2019s.\u201d He spoke quietly as he pushed his way through all the evidence.</p><p>\u201cBut Marcus didn\u2019t kill anyone!\u201d Jana was adamant.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He kept his gaze on her. \u201cAnd Beth wasn\u2019t an Ignitor, not until the girl touched you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, and he knew she understood where he was going.</p><p>\u201cThe person killing, he\u2019s from Perseus,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cOr she is,\u201d Dee added. Dee knew very well that women could be as dangerous-or more dangerous-than men.</p><p>\u201cIf Beth was using a psychic to transfer power from one person to another, hell, it stands to reason she would have done this switch more than once.\u201d He pushed up from the table, and for an instant, darkness swirled around him. The echoes of fear and fury pumped in his blood.</p><p>Not. Again.</p><p>Jana\u2019s hair brushed against his cheek as she steadied him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>With her there, it was. Because she hadn\u2019t turned from him. She\u2019d stayed with him through hell.</p><p>She\u2019d held the demon and loved him. His teeth clenched. He hoped the woman understood, she wasn\u2019t getting away from him now. Not unless she really wanted to break him.</p><p>Weakness. The need for drugs that so many of his kind possessed. But the drugs didn\u2019t call to him. Jana called. Only her. Yeah, he was addicted\u2014to her.</p><p>She was his weakness.</p><p>Don\u2019t let them know your weakness. The voice drifted through his mind, and Zane tensed at the memory.</p><p>\u201cBeth would have made sure she tested the psychic\u2019s power before trying to take my fire.\u201d A furrow appeared between Jana\u2019s brows. \u201cShe would have planned everything, been sure there were no mistakes.\u201d A hard laugh escaped her. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t realize how hot that fire would be.\u201d Her laughter died. \u201cNeither did her psychic.\u201d She swallowed and her eyes grew sad.</p><p>He ran the back of his hand down her arm.</p><p>\u201cSo ... wait, you\u2019re saying those bastards at Perseus found a way to transfer powers?\u201d Jude whistled. \u201cSomeone took your fire?\u201d</p><p>She nodded jerkily.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He rocked back. \u201cAnd you think-you think somebody took a shifter\u2019s gift, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGift, curse, all the same damn thing.\u201d Jana heaved out a hard breath. \u201cIf they could take my fire, they could take someone\u2019s beast. They could take anything.\u201d</p><p>Jude paled a bit. He didn\u2019t want to lose his beast. \u201cYou sure that psychic is dead?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Dee strode forward. \u201cBut you burned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe transfer doesn\u2019t seem to be permanent.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s gaze measured her. \u201cDo you believe there might be another psychic out there who can steal powers, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there probably is, somewhere,\u201d Jana said, her eyes narrowing. \u201cFor a while, I thought I was the only one who could start the fires. Then I found out there were more like me. Why not have more like Laura?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHell. Just what we don\u2019t need.\u201d Jude seemed to be sweating. Zane didn\u2019t blame him. The last thing a shifter would want to hear is that his beast could be taken from him.</p><p>\u201cDid Marcus shift?\u201d Zane asked Jana, pulling her attention back to him. \u201cWhen you were with him, did Marcus\u2019s claws grow, did his teeth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was too weak to shift.\u201d Said with sadness. \u201cJust like he was too weak to fight off the bastard who came for him.\u201d</p> <p>The bastard that he suspected had Tony. The light overhead shattered and sent down a hail of sparks.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Dee said.</p><p>Fuck easy. Where was Tony? \u201cI\u2019m not standing here with my thumb up my a\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door flew open. Catalina stood in the doorway, sweating, chest heaving, and with what looked like tear tracks of blood on her cheeks. \u201cI found him!\u201d A broken mirror, the glass gone black, was gripped tightly in her blood-soaked hands. Simon loomed behind her, but Zane knew the blood hadn\u2019t come from a vampire\u2019s bite. No, this time, it had come from something far worse.</p><p>\u201cDee, tell me you didn\u2019t ask her to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Dee brushed by him and headed for Catalina. \u201cWe needed to find him. She had to scry.\u201d</p><p>Dee had never understood about scrying. She didn\u2019t realize ... Cat looked into the spirit world every time she tried to see the future. And the spirit world ... it looked back at her. When Death looked at you, it was never a good thing.</p><p>He marks you. She\u2019d told Zane that once. Told him that she\u2019d felt Death\u2019s claws in her flesh. He\u2019d seen the scars on her back to prove the claim.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Jude asked, circling close to her.</p><p>Her chest heaving, she said, \u201cDemons-demons were all around him. Closing in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA den?\u201d The question came from Simon. He was right at Catalina\u2019s back. Good thing. The woman would be collapsing soon.</p> <p>Catalina nodded. \u201cIt was black. Covered in darkness. Like a fire had scorched\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the place,\u201d Jana cut in, a thread of excitement in her voice. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about demons in a den and fire, then you\u2019re talking about Dusk.\u201d</p><p>Because she\u2019d lit up that place. Scorched the walls and ceiling.</p><p>Catalina swallowed. \u201cTh-there\u2019s not much time.\u201d Her gaze met Zane\u2019s. \u201cDeath\u2019s already there.\u201d She turned her body a bit, and he caught sight of her shoulder, and the long, bloody claw marks that ravaged the back of her arm.</p><p>He heard Jana\u2019s gasp and knew she\u2019d seen the marks, too.</p><p>\u201cWho has Tony?\u201d He had to understand just what he was walking into at that den.</p><p>A trickle of blood slipped from her mouth. \u201cA demon. I saw-saw his eyes. So dark. So black.\u201d</p><p>Her own eyes began to close. He lunged forward.</p> <p>But Simon had her. He caught the witch and lifted her up high against his chest. Shit. With all that blood, he\u2019d better not be\u2014</p><p>Simon shoved Catalina into Jude\u2019s arms. A muscle jerked in his jaw, and Simon stepped back, fast.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t ... let you down this time.\u201d Catalina\u2019s voice was a whisper. \u201cThis time ... did my part. T-tell Tony ... didn\u2019t ... leave him alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll tell him.\u201d Because they were finding him alive. \u201cJust rest, Cat. We\u2019ll get him.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d make the bastard who took him pay. Perseus had picked the wrong demon to screw, and the wrong human to take.</p><p>Hold on, Tony.</p><p>Zane wrapped his fingers around Jana\u2019s. Help was coming-and help would be in the form of that Perseus bastard\u2019s worst nightmare.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>\u201cHow are we going to do this?\u201d Jana asked. Her gut tightened as they approached the darkened shell that was Dusk.</p><p>Dusk. Well, dawn was actually breaking as they headed for the hollowed-out demon\u2019s den, and dawn wasn\u2019t a real good time when your backup consisted of a pair of vamps. Vamps were weaker during the day. Pretty much at human level. Since they were about to go up against some amped-up demons ...</p><p>Yeah, stronger backup, or maybe actual dusk would have been better.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going in, and we\u2019re kicking ass until we get our man back,\u201d Dee said, not looking real fazed by the fact that the sun had started to rise.</p><p>The male vamp, Simon, was at her side. Figured. From what Jana could tell, he always stayed pretty close to her. Tall, dark, scary ... the guy had done a major freak-out when the blonde was hurt. A freak-out that still had her head throbbing.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. She\u2019d owe him for that. And she always paid her debts.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know how many are waiting inside.\u201d Tension had tightened Zane\u2019s muscles. They were three blocks away from the den. \u201cSo you two will be our distraction.\u201d</p><p>The vamps nodded, but didn\u2019t look particularly happy.</p><p>\u201cYou go in the front, loud and strong, and we\u2019ll take the back.\u201d Zane pointed at Jude. \u201cYou go with us.\u201d</p><p>The big shifter\u2019s face was etched into tight lines of fury. \u201cI can smell his blood from here.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that couldn\u2019t be good. Death\u2019s already there. That was what the witch had said. The last thing Jana wanted to do was walk in there and find the cop\u2019s dead body. For a cop, Tony hadn\u2019t been a bad guy. Not really bad at all.</p><p>The bees began to buzz in Jana\u2019s head. She reached for Zane. \u201cIt ... hurts when you do that.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, then glanced quickly at Dee and Jude. They both shrugged, each with No-I-Don\u2019t-Know-What-the-Hell-She-Means expressions.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not human,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI am. When you amp up the power, I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cThen you stay here. Because if we go in there, and I find Tony and he\u2019s\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou need to be far enough away that the blast doesn\u2019t hit you.\u201d</p><p>The blast? She shook her head. \u201cNo, you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got two vamps,\u201d Simon said. \u201cAnd a shifter. I think we\u2019ve got this covered.\u201d</p><p>The vamp really wanted payback from her. She didn\u2019t look away from Zane. \u201cYou need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you already,\u201d he said. \u201cI need you more than I\u2019ve ever needed anyone.\u201d He almost looked sad for an instant. No, not sad. Like he was\u2014</p><p>\u201cSo I hope you understand when you wake up,\u201d he continued, \u201cI only did this to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Then those bees swarmed in her mind. The green bled from Zane\u2019s eyes, and the darkness she saw in his gaze seemed to reach out to her. She felt his arms catch her as she fell, and then ... nothing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be so pissed with you.\u201d Dee shook her head and frowned down at Jana\u2019s body. \u201cAnd when that woman gets angry\u201d\u2014she shook her right hand\u2014\u201cshe burns.\u201d He grunted. \u201cI\u2019d rather have her pissed than hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what ... you\u2019re just going to leave her here?\u201d Dee asked, lips pulling down. \u201cWhat if some of the other assholes out here find her?\u201d</p><p>Good fucking point. He grunted and looked at Jude. \u201cKeep her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you need me in there! You don\u2019t know what\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to stay with Jana.\u201d The shifter would understand. He might not like it, but he\u2019d understand. Jude had his own lady that he\u2019d die to protect. \u201cI can track Tony. He\u2019s human. I can send out a psychic wave and feel him once I\u2019m inside.\u201d He just had to get closer to make contact. \u201cJude, keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>When had she come to mean so much? Come to mean ... everything? When she\u2019d gone after the demons who\u2019d attacked him? When she\u2019d braved the fires at Perseus for him? When they\u2019d made love and she whispered his name?</p><p>Hell, it didn\u2019t matter when. She was under his skin, locked in what was left of his heart, and he wasn\u2019t risking her.</p><p>Don\u2019t let them know your weakness.</p><p>The killer already knew, and Zane would be damned if he put Jana at risk. He would have left her back at Night Watch, but the drugs had dulled his powers and he hadn\u2019t been able to put her out then.</p><p>Now his strength had returned. Real good thing.</p><p>\u201cBe back soon, baby,\u201d he whispered and brushed a kiss over her still lips. He looked up at Jude.</p><p>The shifter nodded his head in agreement. \u201cWatch your ass, demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d He squared his shoulders, ignored the throbbing in his head, and walked away from the woman who could break him. The demons were waiting for him. Holding the human he called his friend.</p><p>\u201cDistract them,\u201d he ordered Dee and knew that she would. With her new vampire skills, she\u2019d tear a path right through any demons who were waiting inside. She and Simon would be more than a match for at least a dozen demons. Well, they\u2019d be a match while the sun stayed low. Since time was against them, they all needed to haul ass.</p><p>But how many were inside? Catalina hadn\u2019t told them for sure. Just that Tony was surrounded by Zane\u2019s brethren.</p><p>He split from the vampires and kept to the waning shadows. The stench of burnt wood and ash hung in the air. He slipped down the alley, moving as soundlessly as he could. He sure didn\u2019t want to tip off his prey. Not now.</p><p>The back door was boarded up. Boarded from the outside, as if someone had tried to keep the demons in.</p><p>He stared at those boards and let his power flare. The nails began to ease out of the wood. Slowly, so slowly, and carefully. The nails dropped to the ground with a soft clink. He caught the boards before they could fall.</p><p>Then he heard a roar. A loud, guttural cry of female fury.</p><p>Dee. Timing her distraction perfectly. More shouts filled the air as the demons inside attacked or were attacked.</p><p>He eased open the door and went into the hollowed-out hell. The scents were stronger. The ash stained his fingers when his hand brushed against the wall. The odor of blood was stronger. Thicker. His heart slammed into his chest. Too much blood.</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath rasped out. If Tony was dead ...</p><p>A floorboard squeaked and he whirled around. A demon stared back at him. A demon with the face of innocence and eyes blacker than the ash. Screams echoed from the front of the den. Curses filled the air.</p><p>The demon smiled at him. \u201cI was wondering how long it would take for you to get here,\u201d Davey said, and he shook his blond head. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like the human had that long to keep living. We were running out of time.\u201d</p><p>Zane lunged for him and grabbed the kid by his shirt. He jerked Davey close. \u201cYou fucking bastard.\u201d Davey. The kid. The barely legal asshole.</p><p>My damn fault. I let him live.</p><p>Davey must have read the thoughts on Zane\u2019s face because he laughed. \u201cGuess you\u2019re wishing you\u2019d just let me burn, huh? But don\u2019t feel too bad. I would\u2019ve gotten out anyway.\u201d</p><p>But the little bastard had been all but begging for help then. As powerful as he seemed now, why would he have\u2014</p><p>He\u2019d taken the shifter\u2019s powers. And his weaknesses. That cage-Zane would fucking bet it had been made of silver. Couldn\u2019t move it, could you, asshole?</p><p>Zane shoved his fist into Davey\u2019s face. The demon\u2019s nose shattered, and blood sprayed in the air. \u201cWhere. Is. He?\u201d</p><p>Davey wrenched away from him. That perfect smile was bloody now. \u201cI got \u2018em both, you know.\u201d</p><p>More screams. \u201cVampire bitch!\u201d</p><p>Something heavy thudded, shaking the den. Probably a demon hitting a wall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the cop.\u201d Davey swiped the back of his right hand over his mouth and smeared the blood. \u201cAnd the agent.\u201d</p><p>His back teeth clenched. Attack. \u201cI\u2019ll find them both after I kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Davey shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll find their bodies. I sprayed the blood all around the place. Without a shifter, you won\u2019t be able to find \u2018em. Not until it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Fuck that. He\u2019d send out his blast and he\u2019d find them.</p><p>\u201cTell you what ...\u201d Davey nodded, as if he\u2019d just reached some kind of big, damn decision. \u201cI\u2019ll let you hunt \u2018em. I\u2019ll give you two minutes-because hey, you\u2019re supposed to be the big, super demon, right? The badass hybrid.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t speak, but his nostrils flared. He sent out his power, searching for Tony. Searching ...</p><p>And he hit a damn brick wall of darkness.</p><p>Davey laughed and jumped back. \u201cReally, did you think I\u2019d make it that easy? I can\u2019t let you just probe and find them.\u201d</p><p>The fucker had blocked the humans. Shielded them somehow.</p><p>\u201cTwo minutes,\u201d Davey said again. \u201cAnd this whole place will be going down. Think you can save one of them in that time?\u201d</p><p>Flames began to flicker near Davey\u2019s feet.</p><p>Zane sent out a hard burst of his power. The flames didn\u2019t die. They didn\u2019t flicker. They surged higher. Hotter.</p><p>\u201cI learn from my mistakes.\u201d Davey bared his teeth. Teeth that were too sharp for a demon. \u201cThis time, I\u2019m using all of my power, too.\u201d</p><p>And the little bastard was strong.</p><p>The lines of fire raced across the room, then the fire split in two, one branch of flames snaking toward the right, one to the left.</p><p>\u201cBetter hurry,\u201d Davey murmured. \u201cIf the fire gets there first ...\u201d</p><p>Shit. Zane ran to the left.</p><p>\u201cChoose well, demon. Because one of them is already dead. No point in saving the dead.\u201d Death is already there.</p><p>\u201c'Course, vampires don\u2019t like the fire too much, either, do they?\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t look back at the taunt, but he felt the rush of heat and knew that Davey had sent another blast of flame out into the den. How was the demon so strong? Because he\u2019d stolen power from the shifter? Or from a hell of a lot more paranormals? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDee! Simon! Get the hell out of here!\u201d Zane shouted, and he kicked down the door on the left, ignoring the flames that burned his legs and his arms. That blood ... he raced down the hallway, getting a few desperate inches in front of the fire. Hurry, hurry. Another door. Another\u2014</p><p>His foot slammed into the door. Wood shattered. The thick stench of death hit him then. \u201cNo! Fuck, no, Tony!\u201d He shoved his way past the broken wood.</p><p>But Tony wasn\u2019t the one on the floor. Kelly lay there, her eyes wide open, and her throat ripped out. The flames raced toward her, as if homing in on her.</p> <p>\u201cTony!\u201d He spun around, but the flames were walling him in. Zane pushed his power at them, but that fucking kid was stronger than he was. Stronger than any demon he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Playing with me before. Just jerking me around. More screams rose over the flames. Dee. Simon. They needed him.</p><p>Zane stopped pushing his power at the flames. He just ran forward and jumped right through the fire.</p><p>Something tapped her on the cheek. \u201cHey, pyro, come on, wake up.\u201d Another tap, harder this time. \u201cZane\u2019s not even around now. You\u2019ve got to wake up soon.\u201d</p><p>Zane. Her eyelids flew open, and she found Jude staring down at her, his nose less than an inch from hers.</p> <p>\u201cAbout time.\u201d He grabbed her arms and hefted her up. Because she\u2019d been on the ground. What? Why had she been lying on the ground? \u201cI\u2019m smelling fire, and I\u2019m not leaving my team in there alone with the flames.\u201d</p><p>Fire? His team? She stood on shaky legs and turned-then caught sight of Dusk. Jana sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cThat ass left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he tried to protect you.\u201d</p><p>Same thing.</p><p>\u201cBut now they need us.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she could see that. \u201cThen let\u2019s get the hell in there.\u201d</p> <p>Zane raced after the second snake of fire, even knowing that he was too late. The den fell around him. The beaten walls couldn\u2019t hold up against the flames again.</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d Dee\u2019s desperate voice called through the fire and the smoke.</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d Vamps had a tendency to burn way too fast, and he didn\u2019t want Dee burning because she was trying to save his ass. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>Everything was falling around him. He lunged forward, no longer even feeling the blazing bite of the fire on his flesh. The door had burned, and he rushed inside. Zane flew down a corridor, following the flames and\u2014</p><p>Tony\u2019s desperate eyes met his. The cop had a gag in his mouth, and he was handcuffed to a chair\u2014and flames were eating at his legs.</p><p>Zane leapt across the room and knocked Tony back. They hit the floor, hard, and he started slapping at Tony\u2019s legs. But those flames-those flames flared brighter.</p><p>They homed in on Kelly. They\u2019re fucking doing the same with him. Zane had to get Tony out of there. He grabbed the cuffs, jerked, and they broke apart.</p><p>Tony started slapping at the flames.</p> <p>\u201cRun,\u201d Zane shouted.</p><p>Tony coughed. Choked. \u201cWh-where?\u201d</p><p>Because there was no way out. The flames had circled them. The flames had\u2014</p><p>Zane blew out the back wall. He hoisted Tony over his shoulder and hauled ass, running right for the streams of sunlight he could see flickering through the smoke.</p><p>He hit the cement, and felt the bite on his knees. Zane glanced back. The flames were higher, surging and twisting, but not coming past the edge of Dusk.</p><p>Maybe there were some fucking limits to Davey\u2019s power after all.</p><p>Tony coughed and heaved against him. Zane lowered him carefully.</p><p>\u201cYou got him!\u201d Dee ran up to him, her face stained by soot. Simon was at her back. Sweat sliding down his face. \u201cI knew you would!\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been so sure.</p><p>Tony was crouched on the ground now, almost hacking his lungs up.</p><p>\u201cThose demons are burning in there.\u201d Simon\u2019s voice was cold, hollow. \u201cThey were pumped up so high that they ran toward the flames, not from them.\u201d</p><p>The roof collapsed on Dusk. Far, far away-sirens called out. The human cavalry. Coming, at long last.</p><p>He slapped his hand on Tony\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be okay.\u201d</p><p>Tony turned toward him, his eyes stained red, and the skin on his hands blistering. He wouldn\u2019t be healing so easily from those wounds. No, as a human, he\u2019d carry the scars. \u201cF-fucking k-kid...\u201d</p><p>Zane tensed. He could see the claw marks on Tony\u2019s neck now. Not deep enough to kill. Just deep enough for Davey to play.</p><p>\u201cD-demon\u2019s eyes ... sh-shifter\u2019s ... claws ...\u201d</p><p>Dee hurried to Tony\u2019s side. \u201cEasy.\u201d She pushed him back onto the ground. Her hands were so gentle on him. She brushed back his hair. \u201cJust take it easy.\u201d There were tears swimming in her eyes because she\u2019d seen the full damage to Tony\u2019s legs. \u201cSimon, get a damn ambulance!\u201d</p><p>Simon took off running.</p><p>\u201cWho did this to him?\u201d Dee whispered.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Because he\u2019d been soft. He\u2019d shown his weakness, and Davey had seen it.</p><p>She looked back at him with a furrow of confusion between her eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay on guard, Dee.\u201d Because he knew Davey hadn\u2019t died in the flames. He knew and\u2014</p><p>And a tiger\u2019s roar shook the streets. Oh, shit. No.</p><p>But Davey was going after everyone who\u2019d brought down Perseus, and Jude had been there that night.</p><p>\u201cKill anyone who comes close-and if it\u2019s some eighteen-year-old kid with demon\u2019s eyes and blond hair, don\u2019t fucking hesitate.\u201d Because he\u2019d hesitated.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>An ambulance sped up, following close behind Simon as he rushed back to Dee. A fire truck raced behind it.</p><p>Zane followed the roar as fear tightened his heart. If Davey had found Jude, the bastard had also found Jana.</p><p>Jana. He didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d screamed her name.</p><p>Zane rounded the corner, running fast to the spot he\u2019d left Jana. She was supposed to be safe. She was supposed to be\u2014</p><p>She was locked against Davey. The bastard\u2019s claws were at her throat. Jude stood less than five feet away from them, his own claws out, and his fangs bared. \u201cLet her go!\u201d Jude snarled.</p><p>But Davey just jerked her closer against him, and blood leaked down her throat. \u201cStay back!\u201d Davey ordered and his eyes flew from Jude to Zane. \u201cBoth of you, stay the fuck back, or I\u2019ll rip her throat out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll die,\u201d Jude told him, edging closer. \u201cBecause your shield will be gone. I\u2019ll be on you, and you\u2019ll be dead.\u201d</p><p>But Davey, smart, slick Davey, just smiled his still-bloody smile. \u201cShe\u2019ll be dead.\u201d</p><p>Jana\u2019s gaze met Zane\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be crazy.\u201d Davey stared right at Zane as he tossed that out. \u201cAnd you, shifter\u201d-now his eyes darted back to Jude\u2014\u201cyou\u2019ll get your ass kicked five seconds later. Because I\u2019m the strongest damn thing you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Jude growled in response, but his body had frozen.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d come for her,\u201d Davey said, and he wrenched Jana back a step. \u201cWhen I left the fire and I caught her scent ...\u201d His head lowered toward her hair, and he inhaled deeply. \u201cI could have walked away, could have just got in my car and left, coming back to hunt another day. But with such great prey close by, how could I leave?\u201d</p><p>Sick fuck. \u201cShe isn\u2019t prey.\u201d</p><p>More blood trickled down Jana\u2019s neck, but she didn\u2019t make a sound. \u201cShe\u2019s the prey I\u2019ve been after for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you ...\u201d The word seemed to break from Jana\u2019s mouth then. \u201cNot B-Beth, was it? You were Perseus.\u201d</p><p>What? This damn kid? No fucking way.</p><p>Davey\u2019s smile flashed again. \u201cI was wondering if you knew. Beth liked to take credit for every damn thing, but Perseus-that was my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Jude shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re Other. Why would you hunt your own?\u201d</p><p>Davey\u2019s gaze again tracked to Zane. \u201cWhy would he? Why would you?\u201d He licked away some of the blood on his lips.</p><p>Zane saw Jude\u2019s hands clench into fists. \u201cWe go after the bastards who have crossed the line. We don\u2019t hurt innocents. We stop the Other who can\u2019t stop themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d Davey blinked a bit, as if surprised they\u2019d even doubt him. \u201cPerseus goes after those who hurt humans, we- they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a damn lie!\u201d Jana\u2019s eyes were bright. \u201cMarcus didn\u2019t hurt any humans. He\u2014\u201d</p><p>Davey\u2019s left hand wrapped in her hair, and he yanked her head back. \u201cHe sliced open the throat of Clayton Ridge-way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Ridgeway killed Marcus\u2019s girlfriend! And a dozen other women!\u201d Jana didn\u2019t sound scared. Didn\u2019t look it either. Her eyes were so bright ... and starting to become streaked with the faintest of red lines.</p><p>Zane sucked in a sharp breath. Charging up. Could Davey tell?</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what Ridgeway did.\u201d No smile lifted Davey\u2019s lips now. \u201cParanormals can\u2019t kill humans. The two worlds aren\u2019t meant to cross. When they do, hell comes.\u201d</p><p>Hell comes. \u201cThe two worlds cross all the time.\u201d Zane risked a few steps closer. The claws didn\u2019t dig any deeper into Jana\u2019s throat. \u201cThat crossing ... that\u2019s how you and I got to be here, right? Hybrids, both of us. For me, because my mother loved a demon, and for you, because your dad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about him!\u201d The scream echoed through the night.</p><p>Yeah, okay, obviously he\u2019d just found Davey\u2019s weakness.</p><p>\u201cMy dad did the damn best he could. He couldn\u2019t help that a demon tricked him, got into his mind and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what he told you?\u201d Zane asked quietly, keeping the emotion out of his voice. Her throat was still bleeding. If those claws dug in a bit more ... \u201cThat your mother used her power to work into his mind and steal his will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a demon. She tricked him. Made him think she was human.\u201d Sweat slid down Davey\u2019s temples. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even know, not until she had me, not until he saw her eyes change.\u201d</p><p>Well, shit. \u201cThe delivery, right?\u201d Because when you were having a baby, you probably weren\u2019t real focused on holding the glamour.</p><p>\u201cHe saw her for what she was then.\u201d</p><p>Jana slammed her elbow into his stomach. \u201cDemons are fucking people, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJana!\u201d</p><p>Davey snarled and held her tighter, harder. \u201cThe bitch deserved what she got!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jana taunted him. Always taunting, always pushing ... and giving Zane the chance to slip ever closer. \u201cWhat did she deserve? You for a son? The woman must have really screwed some people over to get\u2014\u201d</p><p>He whirled her around and drove his fist into her jaw. Jana went down, and Zane lunged forward as the fury burned through him. Davey was reaching for her again, death in his eyes, when Zane slammed into the bastard. \u201dDon\u2019t fucking touch her!\u201d</p><p>They crashed into the ground. The air thickened around them. So hot. Heavy with power and rage.</p><p>But Davey wasn\u2019t attacking. He just stared up at Zane. \u201cYou understand. I know you do. You killed your father. You know what a sick bastard he was.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m not like him. He\u2019d been afraid, for so long, but...</p><p>Demons are fucking people, too. Jana\u2019s words rang in his ears. His strong, fierce Jana. \u201cHe was a bastard all right, but not because he was a demon. Just because he was one twisted addict who got off on his drugs and on giving pain to others.\u201d</p><p>Davey blinked. \u201cNo, no, you understand\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat do I understand?\u201d He kept his arms loose at his sides. The attack would come again. He knew it. Jude circled behind the other demon. Jana rose slowly to her feet. He caught sight of blood dripping from her lips. Fuck. \u201cI\u2019m a demon, Davey. You are, too. And you\u2019re a twisted asshole, that I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not, Zane.\u201d Jana\u2019s voice. Still strong. \u201cYou\u2019re not like your father or like Davey.\u201d</p><p>He stared into Davey\u2019s black eyes. Demon eyes, but eyes filled with hate and fury. \u201cNo, but I think our Davey might be one hell of a lot like his old man. He taught you to hate, didn\u2019t he, Davey? Taught you to destroy the things that were different in this world. To destroy the things he didn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Davey charged him with his claws out. \u201cThe bitch deserved to die! She would have made me evil, made me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zane sidestepped the attack and drove a fist into Davey\u2019s back. \u201cYou are evil. You don\u2019t even realize it.\u201d</p><p>Davey hit the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou killed a human, Davey. That girl at the college- Lindsey was human.\u201d</p><p>Davey jumped back to his feet. The wind began to roar around them. \u201cThe bitch would have told what she knew about Laura and Perseus. I wasn\u2019t gonna let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because then the big lie about Perseus defending the humans would fall apart? Because the truth is that you were just using the psychic to steal power, power that you took, that Beth took, hell, that others at Perseus probably took, too? Because deep down, you all just wanted to be the badasses that people feared in the night?\u201d Zane shook his head. \u201cGive me a break\u2014\u201d</p><p>The wind slammed into him with the force of a bus. Zane flew back and rammed into the brick wall. He heard Jude\u2019s hard grunt and turned just in time to see the shifter slam face first into the side of a garbage dumpster. The shifter\u2019s body slid to the ground, and a large dent hollowed the side of the dumpster. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane pushed to his feet. \u201cThat the best you\u2019ve got?\u201d His shoulder had been dislocated. No big deal. He was also pretty sure that the back of his head was bleeding. Still, he was walking, and he was ready for his turn to attack.</p><p>Davey stared back at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat me.\u201d</p><p>He was pretty sure he could. \u201cI\u2019d say I have a fifty-fifty shot.\u201d More, because Jude was starting to push to his knees. Can\u2019t keep a good shifter down.</p> <p>\u201cMarcus wasn\u2019t the first.\u201d Davey spit on the ground. \u201cAnd Laura wasn\u2019t the first transference psychic we found, either. Our first psychic didn\u2019t last as long, though, but Donna did manage to steal a Born Master\u2019s youth for me.\u201d</p><p>Zane kept his face blank. Born Masters were the vampires who were born with the immortal power already locked within them. Then they hit their late teens or early twenties and stopped aging. If that little bastard had really managed to steal a Born Master\u2019s youth ... \u201cHow the hell old are you really, Davey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty-eight.\u201d Davey licked his lips. \u201cI look real good, don\u2019t I? \u2018Course, Donna didn\u2019t look as good. The psychics can be weak sometimes, you know. They take the full hit of the power-that blast can be hell on a human.\u201d</p><p>Jana stood behind Davey. Zane saw that the red in her eyes had darkened even more. Charging. Beth hadn\u2019t permanently stolen her power. Those odds of kicking Davey\u2019s ass were looking better and better.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Donna?\u201d Zane asked, trying to keep Davey focused on him.</p> <p>A little shrug. \u201cLet\u2019s just say she got a little too young. Her body couldn\u2019t handle things. I stole what I could from her before she ... well ... before the end came for her.\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cSo after Donna, you lucked out and found Laura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuck had nothing do with it.\u201d His gaze darted to Jude. The shifter was still on his knees, with his head down. \u201cIt took us months to find her and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zane attacked. He shoved his psychic energy right at Davey, blasting as hard as he could. This time, Davey was the one to fly through the air. He flew into the window on the side of the building, smashing glass and disappearing inside.</p><p>Zane ran forward and grabbed Jana\u2019s arm. \u201cGet the hell out of here,\u201d he told her. \u201cRun. Go to Dusk. Find Dee. You\u2019ve got to get out\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shards of glass flew into his arms and back. Swearing, he shielded Jana as the glass flew. The sharp edges embedded in his skin and dug deep.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not getting away.\u201d Davey\u2019s voice was darker. Harder. He climbed from the broken window, knocking glass off his shoulders. \u201cShe betrayed Perseus, and that bitch is dying tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane...\u201d Jana breathed his name and her fingertips pressed against him. Even through the clothing, he could feel the heat of her skin. Come on, baby, burn.</p><p>\u201cWhy does she matter?\u201d he yelled at the asshole. \u201cYou took her power away. She\u2019s not a threat to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A fast agreement. \u201cShe\u2019s not... now she\u2019s just easy prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t hurt humans!\u201d Sick freak. Zane concentrated and the glass shards slipped from his body-and then they flew right at Davey. They hit the demon in the face.</p><p>Davey howled.</p><p>\u201cRun, Jana!\u201d Zane launched forward. He heard the snap and crunch of bones. Jude was transforming. When Jude shifted, he\u2019d be a white tiger, and they\u2019d tear the demon apart. This fight was ending.</p><p>He reached out, his hands ready to rip into Davey.</p> <p>The demon disappeared. Zane grabbed only air. What?</p><p>Laughter teased his ears and a chill skated down his spine.</p><p>\u201cThe second Other I drained was a djinn. Those djinns ... they can move fast. So fast.\u201d</p><p>So fast it seemed they vanished into thin air.</p><p>Turning slowly, Zane locked eyes on Davey. The bastard had Jana again.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know\u201d-Davey\u2019s eyes narrowed\u2014\u201cshe wasn\u2019t running away. She was running after you. Kind of sweet, hmmm?\u201d He held up his claws. \u201cYou know I got these from my last transfer. One slice ... that\u2019s all it will take, and everyone will know that you don\u2019t fuck with Perseus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d The word was bit out, and it was directed at the poised tiger, not at Davey. Because Jude had shifted completely now, and if he attacked ... Jana\u2019s dead.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Davey said, his grin coming back. \u201cShe\u2019s still dead.\u201d</p><p>His gaze jerked to Jana\u2019s. The whites of her eyes were blood-red now. But Davey hadn\u2019t looked at her. He didn\u2019t even realize ... \u201cI should have told you sooner. I should have trusted you sooner,\u201d Zane told her, needing to say these words. Needing her to understand. Everything she was\u2014\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s so fucking sweet,\u201d Davey sneered. \u201cMy old man told me that my mother said the same crap before he slit her throat.\u201d Davey\u2019s claws came up to Jana\u2019s throat. \u201cWanna tell him the same thing? Wanna tell him\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jana smiled at Zane.</p><p>Burn him. The whisper floated through his mind. He swallowed and pushed his power forward, wanting to be ready to attack with her.</p><p>Jana tossed back her hair and she said, \u201cFuck you.\u201d Not words for Zane. The snarl was for Davey as she spun toward him. The demon\u2019s claws slashed over her skin. Blood poured. \u201cGo to hell!\u201d Then the fire erupted. Her fire.</p><p>And Zane pushed all of his energy, all of his fire, at the demon, too.</p><p>Davey screamed-it was the last sound he ever made as the demon erupted in flames.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much left of Davey. Zane stood in the alley and stared at the flickering flames. No matter how much power the demon had stolen, he hadn\u2019t been able to heal from an Ignitor\u2019s blast, not delivered at point-blank range with a full charge.</p><p>That fire had burned so high. So wild. Cops were coming. Firefighters, too. The EMTs would be there, but there wasn\u2019t anything they could do to help Davey. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d Jude asked him, his voice gruff. Zane glanced back. Jude had on a pair of jeans, nothing else. At least he was back in human form. \u201cGone,\u201d he said, and the word felt hollow.</p><p>Jude\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAw, shit, man, the fire\u2014\u201d He laughed at that. \u201cNo, no, that fire didn\u2019t touch her.\u201d She\u2019d been safely away from the flames. He\u2019d run forward, and pushed her back even more as he tried to make sure the bastard was gone.</p><p>No coming back from that. Davey had been strong, but not strong enough.</p><p>He\u2019d turned back to face Jana just as he\u2019d heard the shout of approaching cops, but she\u2019d been gone.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we tell the cops?\u201d Jude asked him softly. His gaze raked the night. He could still smell Jana. Her blood. Her scent. Rising over the smoke and ash. \u201cWe tell them that a killer confessed to us, then he torched himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be questions.\u201d \u201cThere always are.\u201d</p><p>Cops hurried toward them. \u201cHands up!\u201d one shouted.</p><p>He put his hands up, and then he looked past the uniforms and into the shadows. Her scent lingered so strongly in the air.</p><p>Don\u2019t leave me. The psychic order left him before he could stop it, because, hell, yeah, he was desperate.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re hunters,\u201d Jude said. \u201cWith Night Watch. We were tracking a killer.\u201d He kept his hands up as he talked fast.</p><p>The cop who\u2019d barked the order, an older, balding man, sniffed hard, and his face tightened. \u201cWhat the hell is that smell? What\u2019s burning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be our killer,\u201d Zane said, keeping his own hands up as his gaze swept from the cops to that darkened alley. \u201cOr what\u2019s left of him.\u201d</p><p>The cops began to gag.</p><p>Softly, so softly, he heard the sound of retreating footsteps. Jana.</p><p>He stepped forward, but the older cop had his gun ready and Zane knew he wasn\u2019t supposed to hurt humans. He couldn\u2019t chase after her.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Run then, baby. He hit their mental link easily. Touched her mind and felt her fear and her worry. I\u2019ll find you.</p><p>Because he\u2019d meant what he\u2019d told her before-and he wasn\u2019t about to just let her disappear into the night forever.</p><p>Coward. Jana put a hand to her throat and felt the wet warmth of her blood. Damn that demon, he\u2019d slashed her good and deep.</p><p>The cops were there now, demanding to know what was going on. Wanting to know what had happened to the killer.</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath and could still taste the flames. He felt the fire.</p><p>Her fire, and Zane\u2019s.</p><p>She stumbled away. She\u2019d have to get to a hospital. She\u2019d need stitches and explaining the wounds would be a bitch. She needed the hospital and she needed- Don\u2019t leave me.</p><p>Zane\u2019s voice seemed to echo in her mind. She froze. For an instant, she could feel him. His strong arms around her, his breath on her face. Zane.</p><p>A tear leaked down her cheek. She forced herself to keep going. One step. Another. So many damn cops. She\u2019d have to watch herself.</p><p>Run then, baby. Again, his voice seemed to drift right through her. I\u2019ll find you.</p><p>Such a dark promise. But what would happen when he found her? They weren\u2019t going to get a happily ever after. That wasn\u2019t what waited for her. The fire was back. Whatever Laura had done to her, it hadn\u2019t been a permanent deal. Thank God.</p><p>She was back.</p><p>She slunk deeper into the shadows, aware that her blood was dripping onto the ground. She\u2019d spent so much time hiding in the shadows. Hiding and running. And now she was running away from the one man who\u2019d actually looked at her and said ...</p><p>I love you.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell am I doing?\u201d she whispered. Fear. She tried to pretend that she was never afraid, but at the first sign of those boys in blue, she\u2019d turned tail and left Zane.</p><p>No, they might not have a happy ending, but maybe it was time she started facing up to her past. And to her choices.</p><p>She broke from the shadows and immediately saw a female cop with a curly mass of brown hair. The cop\u2019s eyes widened when she got a good look at Jana.</p><p>\u201cMiss! Miss, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>What the hell? Did it look like she was okay? \u201cGet me ... to a hospital.\u201d Okay, so she was a selfish bitch. She needed treatment, but she did manage to say, \u201cAnd by the way ...\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly strong arms closed around her.</p><p>Jana licked her lips. \u201cI ... killed a man tonight.\u201d</p><p>The cop\u2019s eyes flashed demon black. \u201cNo, honey, what you did was put down a rabid dog.\u201d Those black eyes burned down at her.</p><p>They were the last sight Jana saw.</p><p>He\u2019d answered a million damn questions, and he was done. \u201cHandle it,\u201d Zane ordered Jude and turned away. The scent of Jana\u2019s blood was driving him crazy. She shouldn\u2019t have left when she was hurt. She should have let him take care of her.</p><p>He rushed down the alley, following that scent. The farther he went, the more blood he smelled. A fist squeezed his gut. How badly had she been hurt? Jana?</p><p>No answer. He couldn\u2019t feel her at all anymore.</p><p>Fear whispered through him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>His head turned to the right when he heard the soft voice. A cop stepped forward, her hair tumbling over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Obviously, they were talking about the same she.</p><p>\u201cHospital. She passed out, and I loaded her into an ambulance.\u201d The cop\u2019s brows rose. \u201c'Course, that was after she confessed to killing a man.\u201d</p><p>Hell. He didn\u2019t blink. He knew the cop. Had known Paula Channing for years. After all, he\u2019d made a point of knowing all the demons on the force. But was Paula a demon first and a cop second? Or was she ...?</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cObviously, she was confused. I just told Officer Hill that the suspect poured gasoline on himself and ignited\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing a container with trace amounts of gasoline will magically appear in the evidence room later, huh?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cGood. That will make things easier.\u201d She gave him a smile. A smile that died too fast. \u201cI saw what happened to Tony. That bastard needed to be put down.\u201d He had been.</p><p>\u201cYour girl\u2019s at Mercy General, with Tony.\u201d Paula turned away and headed back into the shadows. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry,\u201d she tossed over her shoulder, \u201cI\u2019ve already forgotten what Jana said to me.\u201d</p><p>When Jana opened her eyes, her throat hurt. Her jaw ached. And a man with midnight-black hair, a too fancy suit, and dark eyes stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ms. Carter.\u201d His voice was Southern, rolling slightly and soft. \u201cMy name is Jason Pak. I\u2019m one of the ... managers ... of Night Watch.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hand and touched her neck. No, not her neck, bandages.</p><p>\u201cYou needed some stitches. Nothing too major,\u201d he murmured, easing a bit away from the bed. A hospital bed. \u201cBut the doctors didn\u2019t want to take any chances.\u201d</p><p>Great. She looked down and found herself in one of those really annoying paper hospital gowns. Jana tugged the IV out of her arm and shoved up to a sitting position. Then she swung her legs over the side of the bed. Lucky for her, when her feet touched the floor, her knees didn\u2019t buckle.</p><p>But, she was pretty sure Pak got a glimpse of her ass.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to run,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe cops aren\u2019t looking for you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, right. She glanced over her shoulder at him. \u201cSince I confessed to killing Davey, they probably are.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSelf-defense.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>True. She had the claw marks to prove it.</p><p>\u201cBut they aren\u2019t after you for Davey\u2019s death ... or for any of the other arsons that were linked to you. Ah, or to your aliases.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cWant to run that by me again?\u201d \u201cActually, I have a job I\u2019d like to offer you, Ms. Carter.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest and gave her what really looked like an alligator\u2019s grin. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you get back in bed? I think you might like what I have to say.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t move. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be your assassin.\u201d Been there, done that.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think Zane is? My assassin?\u201d</p><p>Jana swallowed. She wasn\u2019t touching that, and right then, thinking about Zane hurt. I love you. She blinked, real fast. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve heard this sales pitch before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight Watch isn\u2019t like Perseus.\u201d</p><p>No.</p> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t destroy your life.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut with us, you can finally have a life.\u201d Tempting bastard.</p><p>\u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you like that? Wouldn\u2019t you like a chance to put down some roots? To stop looking over your shoulder and just settle down?\u201d</p><p>The hospital door flew open. Zane stood in the doorway. His face was stained with soot, and his chest heaved.</p><p>Zane.</p><p>\u201cI thought so,\u201d Pak murmured and eased toward the door. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk again soon, my dear. Very, very soon. Your talents would be such an asset to our organization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeat it, Pak.\u201d Zane stalked toward her.</p> <p>Pak smiled that gator grin and exited the room, closing the door softly behind himself.</p><p>\u201cYou ran from me.\u201d Zane seemed to bite off the words.</p><p>She nodded. Scared. She was still scared right then. Nothing, no one, had ever mattered to her as much as he did. I love you.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t love her. Not really. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she whispered, the words slipping out.</p><p>Zane frowned at her. \u201cShouldn\u2019t what?\u201d Then his eyes fell to her throat. \u201cOh, fuck, baby...\u201d His fingers reached for her.</p><p>She stepped back, ramming into the bed. \u201cWhen you touch me,\u201d she told him starkly, truthfully, \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything but you.\u201d</p><p>His face softened. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. No, that\u2019s real good.\u201d</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m not ...\u201d She cleared her throat and tried again. Talking was so hard when his lips were close and she could all but taste him. \u201cI\u2019m not the kind of woman you should love.\u201d</p> <p>He touched her. His fingers slid down her cheek. Feathered over the bandages on her throat. \u201cYou\u2019re the only woman I should love.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand. \u201cZane, I like the fire.\u201d That should be wrong. Liking the flames. The fury. The power. She\u2019d used that fire, so many times. Would use it again. \u201cI\u2019m not some sweet, confused girl. I\u2019ve attacked people. I\u2019ve hurt them,</p><p>I\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever hurt an innocent man or woman?\u201d Jana shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re too hard on yourself, baby.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t seeing who she was. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re too easy on me. Inside, you\u2019re good, so you think that everyone else is like that\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her, then he leaned in, and let his lips press lightly over hers. \u201cHow many times,\u201d he whispered against her mouth, \u201cdo I have to tell you I\u2019m not good?\u201d</p><p>Her heart slammed into her ribs. \u201cYou saw what I did to Davey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I saw what we did.\u201d His eyes were on hers, slowly fading to black. \u201cTogether, we\u2019re pretty damn unstoppable.\u201d</p><p>Together. That word sounded so perfect.</p><p>His hand curled around her chin. He held her so softly, and she knew he\u2019d seen the bruises there. \u201cI don\u2019t like seeing you hurt.\u201d</p><p>A fast laugh escaped her. \u201cI don\u2019t exactly like being hurt.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re so damn beautiful.\u201d That dried up the laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhen you smile, your whole face just lights up.\u201d His lips pressed against hers again, and she wanted to sigh into his mouth. Wanted to wrap her arms around him and hold on tight but ...</p><p>But I\u2019ve got blood and death on my hands. I\u2019ve spent my life running. What will I do when he looks at me and sees what I really am?</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d His head lifted and his eyes were narrowed. Hard. \u201cI know what you really are. You\u2019re a woman. My woman. A woman who\u2019s strong. A woman who isn\u2019t afraid to fight for those she cares about and, yeah, baby, I know you care. You\u2019re a woman who\u2019s had a real shit-hand dealt to her, but you kept fighting. Kept living. You\u2019re the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen. The strongest woman I\u2019ve ever met, and you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Could he hear her heart racing? Her hands were clenched into fists, and her nails dug into her palms because she wanted to touch him so badly. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t ... go into someone\u2019s mind unless she lets you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let me. You finally dropped the wall you had between us when Perseus burned to hell. You let me in.\u201d He tilted her chin back. \u201cDon\u2019t shut me out now. Hell, baby, don\u2019t you get it? You try to say that I\u2019m good ... but only you see that. To the rest of the world-to me-I\u2019m a screwed-up demon asshole. You\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say. What to do.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve fucked things up a few times with us. I should have trusted you sooner. When I found out about the deal Beth offered, hell, I just\u2014it was your chance for a normal life. I thought you\u2019d take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal isn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>One side of his mouth hitched up. \u201cIt\u2019s not me, either.\u201d His gaze searched hers. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to run from me. I want you to give us a chance.\u201d</p><p>Oh, damn. She wanted that chance. Wanted it so badly her whole body shook. \u201cI left ...\u201d She sounded like a croaking frog, so Jana tried again, saying, \u201cI left you in the alley because the cops were there. My instincts with cops ... hell, they tell me to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you stopped running.\u201d Those black eyes saw everything. Saw into her so deeply. \u201cYou found a cop, and you confessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the blood loss made me temporarily insane.\u201d He waited.</p><p>Hell. Okay, she could do this. \u201cOr maybe I didn\u2019t want to run. Maybe I wanted to stay here.\u201d With you. No matter what the consequences were.</p><p>\u201cI already told you, baby, the cops aren\u2019t after you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOthers will be.\u201d He should have fair warning on that. \u201cI\u2019ve pissed off a lot of people in my time.\u201d And she\u2019d keep doing it in the years to come. It was just her way. Playing it safe really wasn\u2019t her game.</p><p>\u201cI piss folks off every day.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about what might come our way.\u201d</p><p>Our way. Oh, but that sounded good.</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said in that alley,\u201d he told her. \u201cI love you. And whether you\u2019re here in Baton Rouge or tearing through the South, I want to be with you. I\u2019ll stay by your side.\u201d His gaze held hers. \u201cYou can count on me.\u201d</p><p>She knew that. She\u2019d known it from the beginning. When a guy raced inside a burning building to save you ... you knew that guy was something special.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t afraid of her fire. Wasn\u2019t worried about her past. He just ... wanted her.</p><p>Jana threw her arms around his neck and pulled Zane close. He grunted, but then his arms were around her, holding her just as tight. Tighter.</p><p>\u201cI love you, demon,\u201d she whispered in his ear, taking the biggest risk of her life. Loving someone else.</p><p>A slight shudder shook his body and then his mouth was on hers. He kissed her hard, deep. With passion and fury.</p><p>With love.</p><p>He could take her fire. Take her fury.</p><p>Their tongues met.</p><p>He could take everything because she knew he\u2019d give her everything he had in return.</p><p>Her demon lover. The man who\u2019d walked through the fire.</p><p>His head lifted. His black eyes saw into her. Saw past the mask that fooled so many others.</p><p>She smiled at him, and knew she\u2019d met her match. Finally, the perfect man to light her fire.</p><p>Catalina Delaney eased away from hospital room 309. Jana was fine. She was with her demon. They were together, holding each other so tight. Just like in the vision Cat had seen so long ago. The vision that told her Zane hadn\u2019t been the man for her.</p><p>Her shoes squeaked a bit as she headed down the hallway. She slipped inside the elevator and rode up to the burn unit.</p><p>Her fingers shook, and she clenched her hands into fists. When the elevator doors opened, she hurried outside. So many cops were standing and sitting in the waiting area, hoping to see Tony. They wouldn\u2019t be getting in yet.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have her connections.</p><p>Pak nodded to her and pointed to the door on the far right. She hurried inside and paced down another corridor.</p><p>Then she saw him. Tony\u2019s face was still just as perfect as always. But his hands ... his legs ... she swallowed and crept toward the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she whispered to him, and began to chant. Her binding marks were gone. Her power was finally back- fully back. Pak thought she could help heal Tony, and she\u2019d prove the charmer right. She\u2019d pay back her debt to him, and her debt to the cop.</p><p>Did Tony even remember the debt she owed him? Probably not. It had been so long ago. He\u2019d just been a rookie on his first beat. She\u2019d been a lost kid.</p><p>So long ago.</p><p>His lashes stirred as she pushed the past from her mind and chanted. The air shifted around her as her power pulsed. Tony would be all right. Better than before, with time. \u201cCat ...\u201d His whisper, when he shouldn\u2019t have known she was there.</p><p>Unable to stop herself, she leaned forward and pressed her lips against his cheek.</p><p>She\u2019d had visions of him over the years, too, and she knew that someday ... someday ...</p><p>Pak smiled as he pushed the hospital door closed. He turned around to face the crowd of cops, crossing his arms over his chest. He\u2019d make sure Catalina wasn\u2019t disturbed. No one needed to see the magic that his newest recruit was working.</p><p>Catalina would make a fine addition to his team, and so would Zane\u2019s Ignitor. So much power there, just waiting.</p><p>Two more on the side of the hunters. The Daveys of the world had better gear up. Hell was coming for them. Because his team was always watching. Always waiting.</p><p>He nodded to one of the demon cops.</p><p>Yes, Pak was ready and so was Night Watch.</p><p>Come and get us, assholes. His team was the best in the business, and even the devil couldn\u2019t take them out.</p><p>But he\u2019d sure like to see the bastard try. </p> </body></html>"]
