I finally dropped the last box on the other side of the room and wiped a streak of sweat from my forehead.</p><p>When I\u2019d moved in with Adam three months ago I\u2019d promised him that all the boxes of junk that I put in his spare room would be sorted out and tidied away within a couple of weeks. I\u2019d unfortunately reneged on that promise and wasn\u2019t ashamed to say I was still leaning on my tumor scare to get me out of the admonishment that should have followed. I\u2019d been diagnosed with my benign\u2014and yet still terrifying\u2014brain tumor eight months ago, a diagnosis that not only traumatized my family and friend, Joss, but had kicked Adam, my brother\u2019s best friend, swiftly up the behind. He\u2019d finally admitted to everyone he was in love with me, and we\u2019d hardly spent a day apart since. Although our relationship had changed, we were still us and Adam tried not to treat me like I was made of glass. However, I\u2019d noticed he let me away with things he wouldn\u2019t have before\u2014such as cluttering up his clutter-free, swanky duplex with all my rubbish\u2014and I didn\u2019t know if this was because of the scare or because we were a couple now and he was compromising.</p><p>I swooped down on the last box with a grunt of triumph and ripped off the packing tape.</p> <p>Inside I found exactly what I was looking for and smiled. I\u2019d already upended the box and sent my old diaries cascading across Adam\u2019s hardwood floors before it occurred to me that upending a box of diaries might cause scratches. Wincing, I did this silly little dance over the falling journals as if this would somehow, magically, soften the impact of their rapid descent.</p><p>It didn\u2019t.</p><p>I dropped to my knees and picked up the books, checking the floors. Nothing. Thank God.</p><p>Adam was an architect and that meant he liked his space a certain way, and he liked that space in pristine condition, especially when it cost him a fortune. Hardwood flooring wasn\u2019t cheap. Adam had already changed his life for me, doing a three-sixty from the ultimate player to devoted boyfriend, from bachelor and proud clutter-free homeowner, to doting partner and proud owner of a stylish duplex covered in weird crap his quirky, overly-romantic girlfriend picked up in random places, including charity shops. He\u2019d allowed me to put my stamp in every room, so damaging his floors wasn\u2019t exactly a nice way to pay him back. I kissed the tips of my fingers and pressed them against the floor in a gesture of apology.</p><p>\u201cEls, what was that noise? You okay?\u201d Adam\u2019s deep voice could be heard from across the hall. He was in his office working on his and Braden\u2019s current project.</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I called back, flipping through the diaries to make sure I had every single one of them. I was so lost in what I was doing I didn\u2019t hear Adam\u2019s footsteps.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d His voice was suddenly right above me and I jumped, startled, only to lose my balance, falling onto my bottom with an \u201coof.\u201d</p><p>I heard him smother a snort and glared up at him. \u201cI need to get you a bell.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring me, Adam crouched down onto his haunches, his eyes taking in the diaries. As always when I studied him I got a little flutter in the pit of my stomach, and my skin tingled.</p><p>With his thick, dark hair and great body (honed from daily visits to the gym) Adam was a good-looking guy but the kind of good-looking that immediately transformed to hot when you started to talk to him. He had a toe-curling wicked smile, intelligent dark brown eyes that twinkled when he was interested in what you were saying, and a rich voice that took direct pathways to a woman\u2019s erogenous zones. Those gorgeous eyes of his lifted to smile into mine. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you with one of these in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy diaries?\u201d I nodded, trying to sort them into chronological order. \u201cI stopped writing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped after we got together. There didn\u2019t seem to be any point in them any more since they were basically just an outlet for my feelings for you.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked up at the corner. \u201cBaby,\u201d he murmured and reached over to tuck a length of short hair behind my ear. I frowned at the reminder my hair was short. Before the tumor, I had a head of long, pale blonde hair. I\u2019d loved my hair, and I knew Adam had loved my hair.</p><p>But the surgeons had shaved a patch of it off my head to cut into my brain unobstructed. I\u2019d covered the patch with a headscarf but had eventually stopped wearing them as the hair grew back out, and I allowed my mother to talk me into getting \u201ca chic pixie cut\u201d.</p><p>I was horrified when I walked out of the hair salon, and only somewhat appeased when Adam told me he thought my new hair was sexy and cute. I was completely appeased when Joss told me anything was better than a tumor.</p><p>She was right. If my tumor had taught me one thing about life it was to not sweat the small stuff. That didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t damn annoying waiting for my hair to grow back in. At the moment it was barely to my chin.</p><p>\u201cSo why are you looking at these?\u201d Adam asked, picking one up and absentmindedly flicking through it. I didn\u2019t mind. I was a pretty open person anyway, but especially with Adam. I wasn\u2019t embarrassed by anything I wrote. I trusted him with the very depths of who I was.</p><p>\u201cFor Joss,\u201d I replied brightly, feeling giddy about the whole thing.</p> <p>Last night, Joss and I had been hanging out at her and Braden\u2019s flat\u2014my old flat on Dublin Street\u2014and she\u2019d told me her manuscript was coming along nicely. Joss was American, a writer, and she\u2019d come to Edinburgh to escape a tragic past. Her story broke my heart. When she was fourteen she\u2019d lost her entire family in a car accident. I couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine what that must have been like for her. I just knew it had a left a deep mark.</p><p>I\u2019d liked Joss immediately when I interviewed her to be my flatmate, but I\u2019d known then there was something broken about her, and I\u2019d decided I wanted to help somehow. She\u2019d been pretty closed-off but when she started dating my big brother, Braden, I watched her slowly change. She said Braden and I both changed her, but really it was him. He\u2019d helped her so much that she\u2019d even begun to write a story based on her parent\u2019s relationship. That was a huge step for her, and she\u2019d told me last night she couldn\u2019t believe how much she was enjoying writing it. It had given me an idea for her next project.</p><p>\u201cWhy for Joss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause inside these diaries is the history of us.\u201d I grinned at him. \u201cIt\u2019s a good romance story. I think it should be her next novel.\u201d</p><p>I could see Adam was dying to laugh and I had no idea why so I ignored it. \u201cNext romance novel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext as in follows the previous romance. The story about her parents is a romance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, I\u2019m pretty sure Joss wouldn\u2019t classify herself as a romance writer. In fact, I\u2019ve heard her say as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have I.\u201d I tossed my first diary back in the box since it wouldn\u2019t aid Joss\u2019s research considering I was seven when I scribbled in it. It was mostly about my Barbies and Sindy dolls and my issues with Sindy\u2019s flat feet and the impossibility of her and Barbie sharing shoes. It used to drive me nuts. \u201cAnd I do believe the lady doth protest too much. She\u2019s definitely a romance writer. I\u2019ve primed her to be a romance writer, subjecting her to so many romantic dramas it would be a miracle if she didn\u2019t become a romance writer.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at me and lowered himself to the floor so he was sitting with his knees bent, my diary still open in his hands. His eyes scanned the pages. \u201cSo you wrote about me in all of these?\u201d</p><p>Yes, yes I had. I\u2019d had a big old crush on Adam since I was ten and he was seventeen.</p><p>That big old crush had transformed into an even bigger crush when I was fourteen and then had just snowballed from there. I threw another diary from my childhood in the box and reached for the next one in the pile. \u201cI\u2019ve loved you for a long time, my friend,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cI want to read about it,\u201d he replied softly, the solemnity in his tone bringing my head up, my eyes to his. They glittered at me, full of tenderness and emotion that never failed to make me breathless. \u201cI want every piece of you. Even the stuff I missed without even knowing I was missing it.\u201d</p><p>I felt myself melt. I was a romantic to the very bone and although it would surprise anyone who knew him, Adam catered to my romantic side with a dedication that thrilled me. He had a way with words that turned me to mush... and then usually turned me on so it was a complete win-win for him.</p><p>Giving him another soft smile I turned to the diaries and quickly flicked through them until I discovered the one I wanted. Skimming it, I found the exact entry I was looking for and then held it out to him, holding its place open for him. \u201cHere, start with this. I was fourteen.\u201d</p><p>Adam raised an eyebrow, I assumed at the thought of reading my fourteen-year-old thoughts, and took the diary from me. I knew what he was reading. I remembered it like it was yesterday.</p><p>Monday, March 9th It\u2019s been a really strange day. It started like every other day. I got up just as Clark was rushing out to work, I helped Mum with Hannah since she\u2019s got her hands full with Dec at the moment, and I tried to feed myself as I fed Hannah. This meant I had to change my school shirt because Hannah thinks porridge is for decoration only. I wish that had been the only incident today, but it wasn\u2019t. As soon as I caught up with Allie and June at the school gates, I just knew something was wrong... As soon as the bell rang for lunch break I launched myself out of my seat and hurried out of Spanish class as if the hounds of hell were nipping at my feet. I tried to hold in the tears, I really tried, because I didn\u2019t want any of these idiots to know they\u2019d gotten to me, but as I burst out of the school main entrance, the flood gates opened.</p><p>All the whispering and name-calling... it was horrible. I\u2019d never had that happen to me before. Not like that. People generally liked me. I was nice! I wasn\u2019t... well for one I wasn\u2019t a \u201cwhore\u201d. I cried harder as I heard boys in the year above me laugh at me as I passed them at the gates. Fingers trembling, I pulled out the phone Braden had bought me for Christmas and called my big brother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEls, you okay?\u201d</p><p>As soon as I heard his voice another sob burst forth.</p><p>\u201cEllie?\u201d I could hear his immediate concern. \u201cEllie, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBri\u2014\u201d I struggled to draw in a breath through my tears. \u201cBrian,\u201d my cries continued to interrupt me, \u201cFairmont... he-he\u2019s a fifth year and he-he told everyone he had s-s-sex with me at Allie\u2019s birthday p-party on Saturday night.\u201d I stopped and huddled against a garden fence now that I was far enough away from the somewhat expensive prep school my absentee father paid for me to attend every year. It was only a twenty minute walk from my parent\u2019s home on St. Bernard\u2019s Crescent and I was more than tempted to cut school and hide in the house for the rest of the day.</p><p>\u201cThat little shit,\u201d Braden hissed, his anger actually radiating down the phone and into my hand.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all calling me a whore and a slut, and whispering and laughing at me. Now June isn\u2019t speaking to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell is June not speaking to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fancies Brian. I didn\u2019t even... Braden I spoke, like, four words to him on Saturday night. He asked for a snog and I said, \u201cIn another reality maybe.\u201d\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas there an audience when you said that to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis friends were there, yeah,\u201d I sniffled.</p><p>\u201cSo you turned the little perv down and he started a rumor.\u201d Braden cursed again. \u201cOkay, where are you just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go home. I can\u2019t take another three hours of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you can\u2019t go home. Braebank Prep doesn\u2019t like its pupils to cut class. Wait at the gates just now. I\u2019ll get this sorted out.\u201d I could tell by his tone that Brian Fairmont was about to learn you did not mess with Braden Carmichael\u2019s little sister.</p><p>I hung up and wiped at my face, glad for once that Mum wouldn\u2019t let me wear mascara, or any kind of makeup for that matter, until I turned fifteen. Even then, she said I was allowed to wear mascara and concealer but no foundation, and definitely no lipstick until I was sixteen.</p> <p>My friends thought she was weird.</p><p>Waiting on Braden, I felt a little better knowing he was coming to my rescue. My big brother was really just my half-brother. We shared the same father\u2014Douglas Carmichael.</p><p>Dad was a big deal in Edinburgh, he owned an estate agency and restaurants and a lot of property that he rented out to people. He was loaded, and although he gave time to Braden, he seemed to think spending money on me was a good enough apology for neglecting me the entire fourteen years I\u2019d spent on the planet. His neglect hurt. A lot. But I had Braden, who\u2019d practically helped raise me with Mum, and my step-dad Clark. Mum married Clark five years ago, and since the moment he\u2019d come into Mum\u2019s life he\u2019d made it clear he wanted to be my dad. And he was. More than Douglas Carmichael ever would be.</p><p>I sometimes wondered how it was possible me and Braden were spawned from him. We were both too nice to be Douglas\u2019s kids. Take Braden for instance. After purposefully avoiding working for our father, a few years\u2019 ago he suddenly decided he wanted to take a role in the Carmichael \u2018empire\u2019, which meant he worked his bloody arse off to make our father happy. Not only did he work a lot, he was wrapped up in this girl he was dating.</p><p>Analise. She was an Australian student and they\u2019d just started dating. Braden seemed to really like her. Still, he always found time for me. Say, to rescue me from hideous situations like the one I was in.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d a familiar voice, and not the one I was expecting, caught my ear and I turned my head as a car door slammed. My eyes widened as Adam Gerard Sutherland rounded the hood of his six year old Fiat\u2014 a car Braden said was a stupid drain on Adam\u2019s finances considering Adam was a student at Edinburgh University and getting parked in the city was a nightmare.</p><p>Adam Gerard Sutherland, by the way, was Braden\u2019s best friend.</p><p>I\u2019d had a wee bit of a crush on him since I was ten so I was more than a little mortified that Braden had sent him to rescue me from this situation. Not that I should have been surprised. The two of them had traded that job back and forth since I was tiny.</p> <p>\u201cAdam,\u201d I blanched, wiping at my face to make sure I\u2019d gotten all the tears.</p><p>The way his dark eyes studied me and his jaw clenched, it didn\u2019t matter. My eyes felt puffy and red and obviously were. \u201cBraden\u2019s sorry. He\u2019s in a meeting he can\u2019t get out of,\u201d he said as he approached. He wore a clean, wrinkle-free t-shirt and faded jeans. Adam was too clean and neat to become a typical grungy student. Even his old banger of a car was clean and tidy inside. \u201cHe phoned me. I have a free afternoon. Come here, sweetheart.\u201d Without asking, he pulled me into him and I immediately nestled my cheek against his chest and held on tight, trying not to cry.</p><p>\u201cSo where is this little shit?\u201d</p><p>I pulled back from him, suddenly wary now that he was here and obviously furious. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fifteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixteen.\u201d He curled his lip in anger. \u201cI can\u2019t hit him, but I can scare the absolute fuck out of him.\u201d</p><p>Braden and Adam cursed a lot, and they\u2019d always cursed a lot in front of me. Mum would kill them if she ever found out how much they cursed. Luckily for them it had been drilled into me since the age of zero that you didn\u2019t curse in front of Elodie Nichols, and I\u2019d never repeated the words Braden and Adam used around me. To be fair they limited their curse words to the basics\u2014I\u2019d heard way worse at school. Today in fact, and they\u2019d been directed at me.</p><p>I felt my eyes start to water again.</p><p>Adam saw and his eyes narrowed. \u201cEls, where is this boy?\u201d</p><p>I sighed heavily. \u201cAround the back of the building, behind the lunch room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Adam strode in through the gates and I hurried after him, ignoring the curious gazes of my fellow students, and the excited chatter as they guessed that the clearly older Adam was here on my behalf and something was about to go down.</p><p>My cheeks burned with embarrassment, while my heart pounded in anticipation for a little retribution for the worst morning in the history of my entire school career.</p><p>When we rounded the corner of the building, Adam stopped and stared into a crowd of seniors. The fourth and fifth years gradually turned their heads towards us, their eyes widening at the sight of me with Adam.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Adam asked flatly.</p><p>\u201cBrian is the one with his blazer tied around his waist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tall, blond kid with the bottle of juice in his hand? The one that looks like a prick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle...\u201d Adam growled under his breath and marched toward Brian, hands clenched into fists at his side. Brian\u2019s friend nudged him and he turned toward Adam and instantly paled at the sight of him. When Adam reached him, he towered over Brian by at least five inches. He bent his head, his face close to Brian\u2019s, and whatever he said made the seniors around him grow wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Adam suddenly asked loudly.</p><p>Brian mumbled something.</p><p>\u201cLouder, you lying little shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have sex with her,\u201d Brian cried. \u201cI didn\u2019t touch her!\u201d He turned and caught sight of me watching and his eyes seemed to plead with me to call Adam off. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I lied, alright!\u201d</p><p>A murmur from the crowds drew my eyes past Brian to the lunchroom doors and my stomach dropped when I saw Mr. Mitchell standing there watching Adam. Adam must have seen him too because his head came up. He didn\u2019t, however, back away from Brian.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Mr. Mitchell asked in a belligerent tone, walking toward Adam. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed on school grounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just having a word with Mr. Fairmont here. We\u2019re all good.\u201d Adam shrugged as if he wasn\u2019t a twenty-one year old who\u2019d just gotten through threatening a sixteen year old.</p><p>\u201cBrian, are you okay?\u201d Mr. Mitchell asked.</p><p>\u201cUh, fine, Mr. Mitchell,\u201d he gulped and took a step back from Adam toward the safe proximity of the geography teacher.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d I called now, wanting Adam gone before he got into trouble.</p><p>I drew Mr. Mitchell\u2019s gaze and his face clouded over. \u201cMiss Carmichael, you know quite well you aren\u2019t allowed visitors during school hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mr. Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just leaving.\u201d Adam shot Brian one last warning look and then turned and casually strode toward me. Taking his time. Adam didn\u2019t like to be told what to do. When he reached me, he put an arm around my shoulder and had me walk him back to the school gate. No one was whispering or giving me dirty looks now as we passed. They were all looking at me as if I was extremely cool. I mean, I must be right, if I had Adam Sutherland\u2019s arm around me and he\u2019d shown up at school to scare the truth out of Brian.</p><p>I grinned and Adam caught it, his soft laughter making me all warm and fuzzy.</p><p>\u201cFeel better then?\u201d he asked as we came to a stop.</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing at a party anyway on a Saturday night?\u201d</p><p>I frowned at his proprietary tone. \u201cI\u2019m fourteen, Adam. It was a friend\u2019s birthday.</p><p>Anyway, I didn\u2019t know seniors were going to be there.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cJust be careful, eh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I lowered my eyes, feeling bad that he\u2019d been dragged into my teen drama.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Adam pulled me to him again and pressed a soft kiss to my forehead before he hugged me close. Now that I wasn\u2019t bemoaning my morning and crying on his chest, I was suddenly fully aware of being crushed against him. He smelled amazing and his body was hard with lean muscle. It felt good against mine.</p><p>A weird, tingling feeling erupted in my lower belly and my skin suddenly grew incredibly flushed. I jerked back and tried to cover my awkwardness with a tremulous smile and a goofy wave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adam gave me a quizzical smile and then said, \u201cAnytime you need me, you call, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, sweetheart. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at me again and his grin caused another wave of weird tingling to spread over me. As I watched him get into his car and drive away it occurred to me that my crush on Adam had just intensified. My brain was no longer the only thing attracted to Adam. My hormonally-charged teenage body was now too.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Adam\u2019s brow was puckered as he lifted his head from the diary but he gave me a small, amused smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel about sexually awakening a fourteen year old. It\u2019s all a bit Lolita-like.\u201d</p><p>I laughed at his discomfort. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if you felt the same way about me back then.</p> <p>Anyway, now that I\u2019m yours, would you really have preferred if some other guy gave me my sexual awakening?\u201d</p><p>Now his brow knit together completely and he glanced back down at the pages. \u201cGood point,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I handed him another diary, open to more than half-way through, and took the one with my fourteen year old thoughts out of his hands. \u201cThis is from the year after that.\u201d</p><p>Saturday, September 23rd I am this close to screaming at Adam to stop treating me like a sister. I\u2019m not his sister! I wish he\u2019d just get that already... I took a deep breath, holding the mascara wand away from my eyelashes. Staring at myself in my dressing table mirror, I exhaled slowly and mentally coached myself to calm down. As much as I tried, I could not stop the wild flutter of butterflies in my belly. I gave up and leaned back into the mirror to liberally apply mascara since it was the only makeup Mum would let me wear. I had long fair eye-lashes so no one could tell how long they were until I started wearing black mascara. They were long and now that they were black they made my pale blue eyes even bluer.</p><p>Hopefully the mascara also made me look a little older because, even though I was tall, I was still skinny with small boobs and had a smattering of freckles across the bridge of my nose that made me feel about five years old instead of fifteen.</p><p>I had a date tonight. My first date. With Sam Smith who was a sixth year, meaning he was two years older than me and he was cute and cool and I really, really liked him.</p> <p>As much as I could like any boy who wasn\u2019t Adam.</p><p>Not that Adam was a boy any more.</p><p>A knock sounded at my bedroom door as I ran a brush through my long hair for the hundredth time. \u201cCome in!\u201d I called, somewhat agitated since I thought it was probably my Mum, who seemed to be at once both more excited than me about the date, and also more concerned.</p><p>To my surprise, the head that popped around the door wasn\u2019t Mum\u2019s but Adam\u2019s.</p><p>My heart did this little flippy thing in my chest that it did every time I saw him and I smiled brightly at him. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He stepped inside and closed the door, his brows drawing together in consternation as I stood up to greet him. His eyes travelled the length of me and I saw a muscle tick in his jaw.</p><p>I was wearing a white sleeveless shift dress. It had a modest neckline and I was wearing a cardigan to cover my arms, and black tights to cover my bare legs, but I was guessing the short hemline still pissed him off. The reminder that he thought of me as a little sister he needed to protect pissed me off. I crossed my arms over my chest, and the movement brought his eyes back up to my face.</p><p>\u201cClark told Braden you had a date tonight. We both wanted to drop by for the momentous occasion. Who is he?\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my eyes at his overbearing tone. \u201cJust a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how old is this boy?\u201d Adam asked softly as he took a few steps toward me.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Braden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDownstairs. Don\u2019t dodge the question. How old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam is seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he inhaled sharply. \u201cAnd Elodie agreed to this?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t mention Clark, since Clark was far more laid-back about these things than Mum.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s excited for me actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s chirping like a nervous chicken downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Sam will be here any minute.\u201d I avoided his eyes, not liking that stubborn tilt to his chin.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he taking you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCinema, then dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be home before eleven?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my purse up off my bed and threw out an exaggerated sigh. \u201cYes-uh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t let him touch you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>I froze at his command and narrowed my eyes on him as he took the last remaining steps toward me until he was standing right in front of me, so close I had to tilt my head back to meet his gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s a date, Adam,\u201d I whispered. \u201cTouching is supposed to be involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when you\u2019re a fifteen year old girl. Not when you\u2019re you.\u201d I flinched back, taking that as an insult and Adam immediately grimaced. \u201cEls, I didn\u2019t mean it like that. I just mean... you\u2019re not just some girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Braden gave me this speech three hours ago on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d Adam gave me a look that clearly said \u201cshut up\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re special. You deserve a boy who understands that, and a boy who understands that won\u2019t try any funny business tonight, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny business?\u201d I raised my eyebrows at him. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Sam won\u2019t try any funny business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEls, you\u2019re a romantic, and you\u2019re young. Boys his age... they\u2019re not romantic. They have one thing on their mind and one thing only. And the little swine isn\u2019t getting it from you.\u201d</p><p>Annoyed at his suggestion I was some na\u00efve little girl, I brushed past him. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a comatose date waiting somewhere for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cheeky little bugger,\u201d he grumbled behind me as I walked out of my room and started heading down the stairs. \u201cI preferred you when you were wee and cute and didn\u2019t talk back.\u201d</p><p>I grunted at that and then inhaled on said grunt, choking, at the sound of the doorbell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get that,\u201d Adam announced determinedly, but I flung out my arms and legs in a star- shape, blocking his passage.</p><p>Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t have enough limbs to stop Clark, who hurried out of the living room wearing a glower the likes I\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>Uh oh.</p><p>So perhaps Clark wasn\u2019t as cool about my whole first date thing after all.</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d I breathed, hurrying down the last few steps as Braden came out of the living room with a bottle of beer in hand. Eyes wide at his sudden appearance and the darkening of his expression when he saw my dress, I raced by him and collided against Clark\u2019s back as he finished greeting my date at the door.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right here,\u201d Clark said as I stumbled around him, giving him a questioning look. He was all glaring and intimidating. It was weird.</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d I breathed, feeling my butterflies explode into a flurry again at the sight of him.</p><p>Sam was as tall as Braden, although lanky and slim, and he had messy light brown hair that seemed to have a life of its own. He was famous at school for that hair. All the girls wanted to be the girl who got to run her fingers through that hair. I was hoping after tonight that girl would be me.</p><p>Sam finished eyeing Clark warily and then threw a dimpled smile my way. \u201cHey, Ellie.</p><p>You look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does not.\u201d Braden suddenly appeared behind me and Clark, and I closed my eyes in actual pain after watching Adam squeeze in beside him. They were both trying to fry Sam\u2019s arse with the power of their eyeballs. \u201cShe looks fifteen. You remember that.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Kill me. Kill me now.</p><p>\u201cIf you touch her, I\u2019ll make sure you lose all sense of feeling. Permanently,\u201d Adam warned darkly.</p><p>\u201cWhat he said,\u201d Braden growled.</p><p>When I dared to open my eyes, my heart in my throat, it was to find Sam\u2019s face was ashen as he stared at Braden and Adam as though they were Viking marauders come to cut off his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat is all this?\u201d Mum\u2019s voice sent a rush of relief through me. \u201cGet away from the door.\u201d Adam and Braden were jerked backwards, followed by Clark, until my mum, Elodie Nichols, was left standing alone. Tall and willowy, my mum was still gorgeous, and right now she was an angel.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I breathed gratefully.</p><p>She took one look at my expression and threw a dirty look over her shoulder at the retreating men. It appeased me somewhat to know that when I left on my date with Sam, the three of them would get a verbal tongue-lashing that would make their threats to Sam seem like child\u2019s play.</p><p>When she turned back she held a hand out to my date. \u201cElodie Nichols, it\u2019s lovely to meet you, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, Mrs. Nichols,\u201d Sam replied quietly, clearly not recovered.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you two get on.\u201d Her eyes glistened as she tucked my hair behind my ear and leaned in to press a kiss to my cheek. \u201cHave a great time, darling. Be back before eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got your phone?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and quickly stepped out onto the front stoop, gently pressing Sam toward the street. He didn\u2019t say a word as we walked away, heading for the bus stop.</p><p>\u201cJust ignore them,\u201d I finally advised. \u201cThey\u2019re just messing with you.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a weak smile and then checked his watch. \u201cFilm\u2019s starting soon. We better hurry.\u201d</p><p>*** I slammed the door shut behind me, trying to mentally decimate the angry tears that were determined to spring to my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs that you, darling?\u201d Mum called from the living room.</p><p>Miserable and needing a mum-hug, I moped down the hall and entered the room only to draw to a surprised halt.</p><p>It was ten-thirty and Braden and Adam were still here.</p><p>Mum and Clark were in their armchairs, Braden and Adam on the couch, and all four of them were no longer looking at the television but at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I took one look at them and knew why they were here and angry tears began to fill my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow did your date go?\u201d Mum asked, her question faltering as she took in my expression.</p><p>\u201cAwful,\u201d I bit out and returned my glare to Braden and Adam. \u201cHe\u2019s not asking me out again because of these two idiots.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d Braden responded flatly. \u201cYou\u2019re too young to be dating.\u201d</p><p>Mum sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s not too young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too young,\u201d Adam agreed. \u201cAnd look at what she\u2019s wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with what she\u2019s wearing. She\u2019s got tights on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fifteen,\u201d Braden argued. \u201cShe\u2019s got plenty of time to go on dates. She should concentrate on school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh you sound like an old fart, Braden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe your attitude, Elodie,\u201d Adam sighed. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be more careful about this stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Mum spluttered. \u201cIt was a date.\u201d</p><p>As they squabbled on, my anger had time to grow and seethe, and the humiliation to fester.</p><p>The nicest, cutest, coolest guy at our school had asked me out on a date and my brother and his best friend had ruined it for me. \u201cI liked him,\u201d I suddenly informed them, quietly but with an edge that halted their conversation. They all looked at me and a tear slipped down my cheek as I said, \u201cI really liked him. You both ruined it and you don\u2019t even care.\u201d Chest aching with the pressure of my hurt, I whirled and raced for the stairs, ignoring Braden calling my name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her,\u201d Adam told him which made my legs move faster up the stairs. I banged my bedroom door shut behind me and threw myself on my bed, hiding my face in my pillow as I cried into it.</p> <p>I heard the knock over the sound of my muffled sniffling and lifted my head just enough to growl, \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>I tucked my head back into the pillow and waited.</p><p>Since I knew how tenacious Adam was it didn\u2019t surprise me when he ignored my command. I heard my door open and the creaks of the floor as he walked over to the bed. The bed dipped on my right side and I heard Adam sigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he apologized, his voice deep with sincerity. \u201cSweetheart, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything, my throat burning even deeper when it occurred to me this was the first time Adam had ever hurt me.</p><p>\u201cEls.\u201d</p><p>I turned my face on the pillow so I could see him. I ignored the worried look on his young, gorgeous face and told him stonily, \u201cJust go away, Adam.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair, turning more fully toward me. \u201cLook, I feel like shit, Els. I didn\u2019t mean to ruin your night. Neither did Braden.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sure when you threatened sensory deprivation you had no intention of ruining my chances with Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Adam huffed. \u201cYou are too smart for your age. It\u2019s like arguing with a grown woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know what it\u2019s like to argue with a grown woman? You never stick around long enough to do something to piss them off.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched at my response and he shook his head. \u201cJesus,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>After a minute of silence, Adam turned his head to look down at me again. His expression was no longer amused. In fact he looked deadly serious. \u201cIf this kid dumped you because he\u2019s not man enough to deal with some familial concern, then he\u2019s not the kind of boy you want to be with.\u201d</p><p>The word \u201cfamilial\u201d pushed that little button inside of me and I knew when I glared at him this glare was colder than any that had come before it because it made him stiffen with surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re not my brother, Adam.\u201d I snapped. \u201cStop acting like it.\u201d</p><p>I felt a slash of pain across my chest at the hurt expression in his eyes, guilt instantly making me want to cry even more. \u201cI know that, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>Our eyes met and held, and my awareness of him caused my skin to flush. \u201cDo you?\u201d I murmured a little breathily.</p><p>Something flickered in his gaze and he stood up, looking uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone for a bit. I just wanted you to know I would never intentionally hurt you.\u201d</p><p>When I didn\u2019t say anything, Adam exhaled wearily and left.</p><p>As he was closing my door I heard Braden\u2019s voice right outside it. \u201cShe okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pissed off. Let\u2019s just leave her alone for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to speak to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBraden\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you downstairs,\u201d he cut him off, opening my door and closing it behind him as he stepped inside. Braden\u2019s concerned eyes locked on me as he strode toward my bed.</p><p>\u201cEls, sweetheart,\u201d his voice was gruff as he sat down. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>At that I burst out crying and launched myself against his chest, letting his strong arms hold me tight and his soothing murmurs calm me.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>\u201cYou forgave Braden?\u201d Adam frowned, holding the diary out to me.</p><p>I shrugged, taking it back and putting it next to the one from the year I was fourteen. \u201cYou hurt me more. Not intentionally, of course, but I wanted you to see me as a woman, not a girl.\u201d</p><p>Adam gave me a look that suggested I was daft in the head. \u201cYou were a girl. You were fifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you never saw me that way then? Not that night... in my little dress,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cNot then,\u201d he admitted softly as if worried he\u2019d hurt my feelings. \u201cYou were still Braden\u2019s wee sister then.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t hurt. I had retrospect on my side, and frankly I\u2019d find it somewhat concerning if Adam had fancied my lanky, boob-less fifteen year-old self. Still, I was curious. \u201cWhen did it change for you?\u201d</p><p>I was treated to another \u201care you daft?\u201d look. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s a guy thing that you won\u2019t get and it\u2019ll probably piss you off.\u201d</p><p>Okay, now I was definitely intrigued. \u201cI won\u2019t get annoyed. Just tell me. Please,\u201d I begged sweetly.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He eyed me warily. \u201cIt was the morning after your eighteenth birthday.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened as I remembered. Seriously?</p><p>\u201cThe morning on which you oh so casually told me you\u2019d just lost your virginity.\u201d</p><p>That was the moment he realized he had feelings for me? Jeezo... Joss was right. Men were such cavemen. As that morning came back to me in vivid detail I gave a huff of laughter as I now replayed the whole thing but with the realization that Adam had been jealous. Wow.</p><p>That was not how it had appeared to me at the time. \u201cI knew you were mad at me but I thought it was another overprotective \u201cbig brother\u201d moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Adam shook his head grimly, leaning back on the palms of his hands. \u201cIt was an \u201cI\u2019m looking at my best friend\u2019s wee sister who\u2019s just told me she had sex for the first time and I can see her swollen mouth and her bed hair and I\u2019m getting fucking turned on\u201d</p><p>moment.\u201d His eyes locked on my mouth as he remembered. \u201cMy body reacted to what you\u2019d said before my brain did. I suddenly wondered what your lips felt like, how you\u2019d taste, what it would feel like to have your long legs wrapped around my back as I thrust into you...\u201d I squirmed, feeling my skin heat at the knowledge that Adam was thinking those very appealing thoughts so long ago and I hadn\u2019t had a clue. \u201cThen I got pissed off. At myself for feeling that way about you. And then at the guy for having tasted you. And then at you... for letting him taste you.\u201d</p><p>Our eyes locked and I felt my breathing grow shallow.</p><p>I knew if I didn\u2019t say something else we\u2019d end up making love in his spare room before we could finish our trip down memory lane and frankly I was enjoying the trip. I cleared my throat and grabbed up the next diary, hurriedly flicking through it.</p><p>I found the entry I was looking for and handed it to Adam. \u201cYou should know,\u201d I murmured softly, \u201cThat it all comes back to you.\u201d</p><p>Sunday, April 30th I lost my virginity last night. To Liam. It wasn\u2019t how I\u2019d wanted it to be. It hadn\u2019t been with who I wanted it to be with. It hadn\u2019t been with someone I loved like I\u2019d always promised myself it would be. And it hurt. And then it didn\u2019t. In fact it wasn\u2019t bad at all. But something else hurt last night, and unlike sex it didn\u2019t stop hurting. It hasn\u2019t stopped hurting... The function room at the Marriott Hotel was absolutely packed and as I looked around I realized that I didn\u2019t even know some of these people.</p><p>Still, it was some turn out and Allie had pronounced my eighteenth birthday party a total success and it wasn\u2019t even over yet. Braden had hired the room at the hotel as well as a DJ and caterer. My family had invited more family as well as their friends who invited their friends, and I invited my friends who invited their friends who seemed to have invited their friends. It was a crush, the buffet was almost gone, and the dance floor was full.</p><p>I watched catering staff come out of the back room with fresh trays of food and I scowled as one of the pretty girls was stopped by Adam as she passed. Whatever he said made her laugh and tilt her head flirtatiously. I watched them, ignoring the burn of jealousy in my throat.</p><p>\u201cHave I told you tonight how sexy you look?\u201d</p><p>I was pulled back into a warm body and I lifted my chin, turning my head slightly to look up into Liam Fenton\u2019s handsome face. He was smiling down at me, his eyes glittering a little.</p><p>He was buzzed, but not drunk like Adam who\u2019d started \u201cgetting happy\u201d an hour before the party even began. As per usual he\u2019d turned up alone. From the cracks I\u2019d heard Braden making for years, Adam was a total player and I\u2019d never met a single girl he\u2019d dated.</p><p>Probably because he didn\u2019t \u201cdate\u201d.</p><p>Liam on the other hand appeared to be trying to keep his wits about him. I think I knew why. He was nineteen, a student at Napier University, and we\u2019d met when I\u2019d toured the university last year. We\u2019d kept in touch, chatting online, until seemingly out of the blue Liam asked me out on a date six weeks ago. We\u2019d messed around a little bit (and he\u2019d given me my first orgasm) but I\u2019d been reluctant to have sex with him. I\u2019d filled my head with so many romance novels and movies I was convinced that my first time would be with someone I was in love with. Although I liked Liam and I was attracted to him, I wasn\u2019t in love with him yet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>However, I think he thought because I\u2019d turned eighteen that tonight was going to be the night. Hence why he was trying to stay as sober as possible.</p><p>I felt a little nervous about how I was going to disabuse him of that notion.</p><p>Smiling up at him, I gave him a shy nod. \u201cYou may have mentioned it once or twice.\u201d</p><p>Liam grinned, his hands sliding down to rest on my hips. \u201cIt\u2019s worth mentioning more than once. Every guy in here thinks I\u2019m a lucky bugger and they\u2019d be right.\u201d</p><p>His lips touched mine and it was nice. Really nice. But since my first kiss with Pete Robertson at a Friday bowling night with friends a few months after my disastrous date with Sam, I\u2019d never felt what all the romance books talked about. I\u2019d kissed five guys since then and not one of those kisses made my skin hot and my body vibrate and my stomach flutter. I was beginning to think romance novels might be leading me astray... \u201cDon\u2019t mean to interrupt but I\u2019d like a dance with the birthday girl.\u201d</p><p>I immediately broke away from Liam at the sound of Adam\u2019s voice and turned fully to find him standing in front of me, giving Liam a \u201cyou have five seconds to get your hands off her before I break your face\u201d look. It had been two and a half years since I started dating and Adam and Braden still rejoiced in scaring the crap out of my boyfriends. Thankfully, Liam didn\u2019t scare easy.</p><p>He squeezed my hips. \u201cI\u2019ll go get you another drink. I\u2019ll be over with Allie and the guys.\u201d</p><p>I nodded at him, watching him saunter away through the crowds.</p><p>A warm hand on my wrist drew my gaze back and Adam was grinning at me as he pulled me into him. As soon as my body brushed his I felt that familiar tingling again, the feeling descending between my legs as Adam\u2019s arm caught me around the waist while his other hand caught my hand and laid it against his chest. I rested my other hand on his shoulder and swayed with him. Being this close kind of hampered my breathing and I tried very hard not to let him see that. His fingertips brushed the bottom of my back and since I was wearing a backless dress it was a skin to skin touch. My body reacted to it in a way I recognized and I ducked my head, unable to look at him.</p><p>I\u2019d been in Liam\u2019s dorm room two weeks ago and we\u2019d been making out and touching.</p><p>The touching got a little more involved than I was used to but I was curious so when he slid his hand under my skirt and pushed his fingers under my underwear to touch me there I\u2019d almost come off the bed. I felt it between my legs and I felt it in my breasts. He\u2019d settled a thumb on my clit and played me as my body slowly started to fracture until it eventually broke into this amazingly pleasurable explosion.</p><p>Adam didn\u2019t even need to put a hand between my legs. All he needed to do was touch me and those familiar tingles were vibrating throughout me.</p><p>\u201cEnjoying your birthday?\u201d</p><p>I turned to gaze at him now, my face close to his. I was five foot nine so usually only a couple inches shorter than Adam, but tonight I was wearing four inch heels so I was actually just little bit taller than him. That thought seemed to occur to him too because he gave me a quick once over and grinned, shaking his head as I replied, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s been good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you opened any presents yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was going to later but I think everyone is a bit too drunk to care. Including you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPfft, I\u2019m not drunk. I\u2019ve got a buzz going that\u2019s all.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re not drunk are you?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cAdam, I\u2019m legally allowed to drink now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes or a no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of shots, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>We were quiet a moment and I actually allowed myself to relax against him. That was until he flexed his fingers against my back and an involuntary shiver rippled over me. Adam tensed, as if he\u2019d felt my reaction, and I quickly looked at his face for confirmation. His dark eyes glittered in a way I\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>I gulped.</p> <p>He studied me a moment and I found myself pressed even tighter against him. My fingers curled into his shoulder. His next words almost blew me off my feet. \u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen, Els,\u201d he said, his voice thick with emotion.</p><p>My eyes grew round with shock at his announcement, my heart beginning to thud against my chest. Adam thought I was beautiful? No, not just beautiful... \u201cthe most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever seen\u201d.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>My chest began to rise and fall a little rapidly. \u201cAdam...\u201d I replied softly, unsure whether he meant that in a strictly platonic sense or if he was finally opening his eyes up to see I wasn\u2019t a little girl anymore. For a start I had boobs now.</p><p>\u201cI worry about you all the time,\u201d he confessed. \u201cYou\u2019re so sweet and kind, too kind sometimes. I worry someone will hurt you and I won\u2019t be there to stop it.\u201d</p><p>It was true I had a tendency to look for the best in everyone, and I had a bit of a hero- complex (I wonder where I\u2019d picked that up from), but I wasn\u2019t incompetent. And I was a woman now. I could take care of myself, and I told him so.</p><p>Adam frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. You get a lot of male attention, Ellie, and sometimes it\u2019s difficult to weed out the wankers. For instance the kid you came with tonight.</p><p>He flirts a lot... with everything that has tits and a pair of long legs.\u201d</p><p>Glowering at the insult to Liam, I tried to press back. \u201cLiam is a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam is after one thing. I should know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, you\u2019ve been hogging her enough.\u201d Braden was suddenly standing beside us, grinning. \u201cI want a dance with the birthday girl.\u201d</p><p>Adam tightened his hold on me and then as if it occurred to him what he was doing, he threw Braden a grin and let me go. We shared one last look and then he was gone and I was in Braden\u2019s arms.</p><p>What the hell had just happened? Had Adam Sutherland... was he... was that more than friendly advice? The way he touched me, the things he\u2019d said, the way he\u2019d looked at me. It had felt different. My heart was racing, a bubble of giddy hope starting to float up inside of me. Poor Liam was forgotten as I got lost in my longing and fantasies.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d Braden told me gruffly, bringing me out of my head where I was already picking wedding dresses and deciding who would be my maid of honor. I guessed it would have to be Allie since I\u2019d known her the longest.</p><p>I smiled at my big brother, feeling my chest expand at his declaration. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor many reasons. For getting into Edinburgh Uni. For taking care of Elodie and Clark, and for being a good sister to Hannah and Dec. And for being a great wee sister to me. It\u2019s been a tough year, Els, and I\u2019m grateful for all your help.\u201d</p><p>I hugged him close for a second, my heart hurting all over again for him. After falling for and marrying his Australian wife, Analise, Braden had filed for divorce when he walked in on her and his old school friend having sex in one of Braden\u2019s empty developments in New Town. The bitch had put him through the ringer for the last nine months of his marriage and then she\u2019d cheated on him with his friend. It was the ultimate betrayal. Worse, our dad had been the one who\u2019d cottoned onto it and he\u2019d set Braden up to find the traitorous couple. That was dad\u2019s way. Rather than pulling his son aside and letting him down easy, he\u2019d let Braden walk into that. Braden didn\u2019t seem to mind. In fact he was grateful to our father. I, on the other hand, thought he was an insensitive arsehole. Then again, I didn\u2019t exactly have fluffy feelings toward Douglas Carmichael at the moment (or ever).</p><p>As if he\u2019d read my mind, Braden sighed. \u201cDad\u2019s sorry he couldn\u2019t be here, Ellie. I\u2019m sorry too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize for him.\u201d I turned my face away, screwing it up to stop the tears. You would think after eighteen years of complete neglect I\u2019d be over the hurt by now.</p><p>Unfortunately, the hurt never went away. I just couldn\u2019t understand what Douglas found so unloveable about me that he\u2019d deliberately shun me time and time again. It was my eighteenth birthday for God\u2019s sake and he couldn\u2019t get up off his rich arse for half an hour to pop into offer me birthday wishes.</p><p>Braden sighed again and I heard him curse under his breath. He had a fairly good relationship with our dad now and I didn\u2019t want to be the cause of any problems between them so I gave him a squeeze and smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m more than fine. I\u2019m surrounded by friends and family who care about me, Braden. And that\u2019s all I care about.\u201d</p><p>We shared a smile and another hug seconds before the music changed to up tempo again, and mum and Clark descended on us. I had a dance with the two of them, giggling as they pulled out moves that hadn\u2019t been seen in at least two decades.</p><p>As the night continued on, I mingled with friends and family but my eyes kept wandering through the crowds in an attempt to find Adam again. My stomach was a riot of butterflies, and I couldn\u2019t get his voice out of my head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen, Els,\u201d</p><p>I smiled at something Allie said to Liam and watched it crack him up but I had no idea what the conversation was about. My head was stuck in rewind.</p><p>When the room began to feel too hot, I ordered a bottle of water from the bar and slipped out of the back of the room and found directions to the exit. It was the fire exit and it led out to the back of the hotel where all the rubbish bins were stored. I crept outside quietly, sucking in a huge gulp of air and enjoying the peace. It could give me a moment to wrap my head around what had happened and if what I thought had happened had actually happened.</p><p>I felt a giddy smile start to stretch my lips when a grunt followed by a moan made me freeze. The large wheeled bins were situated between me and an alcove of the building, and the sounds were coming from there. My heart picked up a little bit as I guessed what the sounds meant and what I\u2019d stumbled upon. When another grunt sounded I covered my mouth with my hand to keep in the giggle that was threatening to erupt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d a female voice groaned. \u201cAdam, oh my God.\u201d</p><p>The giggle instantly died as the blood rushed in my ears. I felt a burn in the bottom of my throat as some devil, some masochistic thing inside of me, made me tiptoe silently around the bins.</p><p>All the hope I\u2019d been feeling exploded and disintegrated around me.</p> <p>As I watched Adam screw one of the female catering staff against a brick wall, I realized what an idiot I was. What a childish, na\u00efve idiot.</p><p>And then the anger settled in. The frustration. The pain... that somehow I wasn\u2019t good enough. Not good enough for Adam. Not good enough for my father.</p><p>My eyes narrowed. There was one person who thought I was good enough, so what was I holding out for? For flowers and sonnets and a man on bended knee? That wasn\u2019t going to happen. This was reality. Sex was sex. There was nothing magical about it.</p><p>Clearly.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t naturally an angry person, but the burn of jealousy fueled it and I turned silently back to the hotel. As soon as I was inside, the image of Adam moving against the catering girl kept flashing before my eyes. I felt sick. Chugging back more water, I made a decision. I needed to wipe that image out of my brain.</p> <p>I found Clark talking to his brother in the function room and thankfully Mum wasn\u2019t anywhere around because what I was going to ask she\u2019d probably not be happy about.</p><p>\u201cEls, what do you want to do with all these presents?\u201d He asked, pointing to a table that had been set up at the back.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you and Mum a big favor?\u201d</p><p>He smirked, guessing what that favor was. \u201cYou want us to take the presents back home for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friends and I want to go onto a club, if that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>Clark studied me for a moment and then finally sighed, \u201cGo on before your Mum sees you. And be careful.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. Leaving him to it, I pushed my way through the dance floor and found Liam and Allie dancing together. I pulled Liam off to the side with an apologetic smile thrown Allie\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked, giving my hip a squeeze.</p><p>I looked into his eyes, feeling my stomach flip as I said meaningfully, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>His body tensed and his eyebrows drew together. \u201cJust me and you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>I pressed close to him, making my intentions very clear. \u201cWhere do you want to take me?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s breathing stuttered. He seemed to swallow hard. \u201cI could get us a room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d</p><p>We left quickly, slipping from the party before Mum or Braden could see me. My nerves kicked in as we made our way through the hotel to the reception, and I fought hard not to throw up as Liam booked us a room.</p><p>Every inch of me was trembling as the lift took us up to the first floor and as soon as we were inside the room and Liam started kissing me he could feel me shaking against him.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d he whispered against my mouth.</p><p>The image I was unsuccessfully trying to bleach from my brain flashed before me again. I wanted tingles and excited butterflies, I wanted flushed skin and passion. I wanted trust and safety, I wanted affection and laughter. I wanted loyalty and friendship. I wanted love.</p><p>Unfortunately, life had played a cruel joke on me and I\u2019d fallen in love with the one person in the whole world I couldn\u2019t have.</p><p>Just because I couldn\u2019t have him, however, didn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t live. None of my friends were virgins any more. What was it really but a nuisance? It used to be a gift. Or at least I liked to romanticize that it was a gift. I supposed what it really used to be was a mark of ownership. But this was the 21st century. No one owned me. And my virginity was something I could give to whoever I pleased.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I whispered back, reaching up to unknot the halter tie on my dress. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Liam thankfully took his time. He made me come before he put on a condom and pushed inside of me so I was as ready as I could be. Still, it hurt. After a while the pain diminished and it felt okay. Liam enjoyed himself. He tried to hold off until I came again but I didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking over and over again as he moved inside me that I\u2019d well and truly buggered everything up for myself.</p><p>I\u2019d promised myself since I was fourteen years old that the first time I made love I\u2019d be in love.</p><p>Instead I was lying in some hotel room while a boy I merely liked casually took the gift I offered, and I casually let him. I felt a heaviness settle on my stomach when Liam was finished.</p><p>I stayed awake listening to him snore beside me and cursed myself to hell for letting anger and jealousy get the better of me.</p><p>*** I lay there for a couple of hours but eventually decided I couldn\u2019t stand to stay in the hotel room. At the back of four in the morning I snuck out of there and had reception call me a taxi.</p><p>The woman on reception took one look at my mad hair and revealing dress and knew exactly what I\u2019d been up to. The smirk she gave me made me feel cheap, and I realized quickly that the only reason I felt cheap was because I thought I\u2019d acted cheap.</p><p>I tried not to cry as the taxi took me home, and I definitely tried not to cry as I quietly let myself inside. I was just creeping toward the stair when a head popped out of the kitchen and gave me heart failure. I sucked in a breath, clutching a hand to my chest in fright.</p><p>Adam stood in the light from the kitchen doorway. He crooked a finger at me and as I approached him I saw that image again of him and caterer girl, and the anger returned.</p><p>I followed him into the kitchen and he closed the door behind me. I studied his face and saw his eyes were bloodshot. The smell of coffee filled the air and I noted cheese toasties sitting on a plate. He was obviously hungover and trying to diminish the affects. I was so busy noting these things that I didn\u2019t notice his anger.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d he hissed at me.</p><p>I glowered at him, momentarily blaming him for the loss of my virginity. \u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust out.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. \u201cWith who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s face instantly darkened and he took a step toward me, his eyes moving over my messy hair and then coming to rest on my mouth. They stuck there until I touched my lips, wondering what was so fascinating about them. \u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d he finally asked, his voice gruff.</p><p>And that was the point in the interrogation I lost my temper. My loss of temper transformed into blas\u00e9 petulance. \u201cI\u2019m eighteen, Adam. I can have sex with my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>His body jerked, like I\u2019d shot him. \u201cSex?\u201d he choked out.</p><p>I shrugged as if my heart wasn\u2019t hammering against my ribcage. \u201cIt was a present to myself.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed, his eyes roaming over me again. \u201cAre you telling me... you lost your virginity last night?\u201d</p><p>I nodded slowly, hearing an edge in his words I was a little bit afraid of.</p><p>Adam\u2019s eyes flared after my confirmation and I stood there squirming as he drank me in from head to foot. I flushed at his appraisal, not quite sure what was happening. And then he made it clearer by turning on his heel and throwing the kitchen door open. Without a care to those sleeping, Adam stormed out of the house, the front door slamming in his wake.</p><p>I let out a shaky breath, realizing what the edge was now.</p><p>Adam thought of himself like my big brother. No big brother wanted to hear that their little sister had \u201cgotten herself some\u201d. More than that, I wondered if he was as disappointed in me as I was in myself. He knew me. He knew I believed in stars and sunsets and \u201chappily ever afters\u201d. I\u2019d compromised my own beliefs by having casual sex with a boy I barely knew.</p><p>The tears came then and I hurried to my room with blurry vision. I grabbed some fresh underwear and pajamas and took them into the bathroom with me. For half an hour I remained in the shower, crying the entire time.</p><p>At least, I told myself, I\u2019d learned a huge lesson.</p><p>I\u2019d learned there were some things in life you could never take back.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Adam put down the diary and looked up at me, something like regret in his eyes. I didn\u2019t want him to feel regret, I just wanted him to know that even if my first time hadn\u2019t been with him, I\u2019d always wanted it to be.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I frowned and shook my head. \u201cDon\u2019t. That\u2019s not what... I just wanted you to know that it\u2019s always been you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your first time should have been special, Els. It should have been romantic.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIn the grand scheme of things it\u2019s not the worst thing that happened. Dad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouglas died a few days after your birthday,\u201d Adam murmured, finishing my sentence.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I whispered back, remembering how mixed up I\u2019d been over my dad\u2019s death. I\u2019d grieved, but I couldn\u2019t work out if I was mourning the idea of a dad or if I was mourning Douglas Carmichael. To make matters worse he left me a boatload of money and it took me a while to come to terms with how that made me feel. Not to mention, \u201cI was mad at him and he died with me mad at him.\u201d</p><p>Adam slid across the floor and put his arm around me, hugging me close. \u201cEllie, I thought you stopped feeling guilty about that. He was a shit dad. You had a right to be angry at him, no matter what happened.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and snuggled closer to him, inhaling the scent of him and his aftershave. He smelled good. He always smelled good.</p><p>We sat in silence for a while until Adam said, \u201cJust so you know, I barely remember what I did with the catering girl. And I had no idea I said that to you at your party\u2014calling you beautiful and telling you I worried all the time about you. Fucking mixed signals. I was pretty drunk that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But in the end you were right about Liam. He ended up cheating on me with Allie.\u201d</p><p>Adam tensed. \u201cThat\u2019s why you stopped talking to Allie? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause you would have beaten the shit out of Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cAlways fighting my battles for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith you, baby. With you, not for you.\u201d</p><p>Liking that a lot, I turned my head and kissed him, loving the now familiar press of his mouth against mine. I pulled back and cocked my head in thought. \u201cI thought the year you started to see me differently was the one after my eighteenth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one after...?\u201d Adam\u2019s eyebrows drew together in thought for a minute and then instantly cleared as he remembered. \u201cThe almost kiss.\u201d</p><p>While he\u2019d been reading the last entry, I\u2019d found the entry I\u2019d expected him to allude to as to the moment he started to see me as more than Braden\u2019s little sister. I held the diary out to him and he took it with a small smile as the memories flooded him.</p><p>Friday, July 5th Tonight I had my first truly grown-up, sophisticated and, well, HOT, date. I\u2019m just not sure who I had it with... As Christian helped me out of the taxi I had to wonder if this was going to be \u201cit\u201d.</p> <p>Christian was handsome, charming, a total gentleman and he had class. He had yet to make me laugh but I was sure that would come as we became more comfortable with one another.</p><p>He smiled at me again as I pushed the hem of my black dress back down. It had shimmied up while I was sitting in the taxi. \u201cYou look stunning.\u201d</p><p>I flushed. When he looked at me like that I felt stunning. I was wearing a plain black sleeveless dress that should have been somewhat modest considering its high neckline and mid-thigh hemline. However, the dress hugged every inch of my body leaving little to the imagination. It was a sophisticated dress with a splash of \u201chot\u201d.</p><p>I\u2019d bought it earlier that day specifically for Christian.</p><p>We\u2019d met a week ago in the student union. Christian was pre-law, two years older than me and from an obviously wealthy and well-to-do family. They had an actual \u201cestate\u201d in the highlands. That had nothing to do with what attracted me to him of course. I was attracted to him and how he\u2019d acted upon our first meeting\u2014 with a fresh and open honesty that really appealed to me. It made me feel like I could be just as open with him. It made me feel like I could be myself.</p><p>Christian had told me that although his family had the estate, they also had a home in Corstorphine, a busy suburb out in the west of the city. His parents had bought it when his sister had moved to Edinburgh and started popping out children. She was pregnant with her third and the entire family was living in Edinburgh to be closer to her. I thought that spoke volumes about them and was more than a little excited to meet them already.</p> <p>To my delight, Christian had booked us a table at La Cour for our first date. I didn\u2019t even get a chance to tell him it was Braden\u2019s restaurant. He inherited it from our father. As we entered I opened my mouth to tell him but Christian started speaking about the menu and what he thought I should order. I was going to tell him I knew what I wanted to order, since I\u2019d eaten at La Cour more times than I could count, when I heard Adam call my name.</p><p>Christian and I drew to a halt as the maitre\u2019d led us to our table, and I turned my head to see Adam sitting in the center of the restaurant across a small table from a gorgeous brunette.</p><p>I ignored the flare of jealousy, squashing it, and reminded myself I was on a date with a fabulous man, and that the gorgeous brunette was just one of many sexual partners for Adam.</p><p>He was a manwhore.</p><p>But he was my manwhore, and I couldn\u2019t help but walk over to him, Christian at my side, with a huge smile on my face, because as always I was delighted to see him.</p><p>Adam grinned up at me, his smile dimming slightly as his gaze flickered to Christian. He gave Christian a once over and then turned those beautiful eyes of his back on me. He perused me with a small smile and when his eyes hit mine they were full of tenderness. \u201cYou look absolutely stunning, Els.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t just flush at his compliment, I burned. \u201cThank you,\u201d I murmured and then gave his date a polite smile. \u201cHullo.\u201d</p><p>She glared at me.</p> <p>Oh well.</p><p>\u201cAdam, this is Christian.\u201d</p><p>Adam gave Christian a taut nod and then flicked his hand to his date. \u201cThis is Megan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Meagan,\u201d she corrected him waspishly, pronouncing it like \u2018mee-gan\u2019 instead of \u2018meh-gan\u2019.</p><p>I saw Adam stifle a long-suffering sigh. Uh oh. His date obviously wasn\u2019t going well.</p><p>\u201cWe better get to our table.\u201d Christian gently pulled on my elbow.</p><p>I gave Adam another smile. \u201cEnjoy your evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, sweetheart.\u201d I moved to follow Christian but had only taken a step to walk away when I felt a tug on the hem of my dress. I glanced down, frowning, and watched Adam pull off the price tag. I blushed as he winked at me.</p><p>I closed my eyes briefly. I\u2019d left the price tag on. I was always doing stuff like that. God, I hoped Christian hadn\u2019t seen it. Opening my eyes I deliberately ignored Adam\u2019s date and mouthed a heartfelt \u201cthank you\u201d. He grinned at me and I smothered a laugh at myself before hurrying to catch up with Christian at our table across the room.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Christian asked casually as we were seated.</p><p>\u201cMy brother\u2019s best friend,\u201d I replied equally casually. \u201cWe grew up together.\u201d</p><p>Christian nodded and then ordered us white wine. I preferred red.</p><p>We chatted as we waited for the waiter to return, and Christian told me all about a charity he was organizing. He stopped talking when the waiter came back and he began to order my food for me. Deciding to think this was charming rather than overbearing I informed him this was my brother\u2019s restaurant and that I knew what I wanted. He was impressed that Braden owned La Cour and for five minutes I told him about Braden\u2019s other businesses.</p><p>After that we were back onto Christian.</p><p>By the time the second course arrived, my hope for this being \u201cit\u201d was diminishing rapidly. Not once did my date appear to take any real interest in me, and the more I realized how self-absorbed he was, the more aware I became of Adam sitting across the room from me. Adam whose eyes glittered with interest every time I opened my mouth.</p><p>I had just picked up my fork to take a bite of my steak when a phone rang. Debussy.</p><p>Really? Even his ringtone was pretentious.</p><p>Yes, by this point the shine had definitely worn off.</p><p>Christian pulled the phone out of his pocket and answered it, his eyes going wide. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d He put the phone back in his pocket and stood up.</p><p>I stared up at him in absolute shock. Was he about to leave me here? In the middle of a date?</p><p>\u201cMy sister just went into labor,\u201d he explained, and I watched as he threw a wad of cash on the table. \u201cStay, finish your meal.\u201d He leaned down and pecked my cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>And then he was gone.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t exactly hate him because he\u2019d abandoned me on our first date to go be by his pregnant sister\u2019s bedside. At that thought I slumped against my chair. Christian was obviously a good person. He just also happened to be incredibly self-involved. It occurred to me he\u2019d been the same way at the student union last week but I\u2019d twisted it in my overly romantic little head and called it open and honest.</p><p>I looked at my food glumly.</p><p>A hand came down on the back of my chair and a shadow appeared above me. I glanced up to find Adam bending over me, a scowl on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck did he go?\u201d he growled.</p><p>God, I loved him.</p><p>\u201cHis sister went into labor.\u201d</p><p>Adam relaxed but didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I promised him. I wasn\u2019t okay. I wanted to cry. And he knew it.</p><p>He straightened and called out to one of the waiters by name. \u201cCan you move us to a larger table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mr. Sutherland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, no,\u201d I protested. \u201cI\u2019m not crashing your date.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my hand and pulled me up. \u201cYou got all dressed up, sweetheart. At the very least you\u2019re going to get to finish your meal.\u201d</p><p>Holding my hand, Adam led me to the new table and gave a jerk of his head to his date to tell her to come to us. He sat next me as Meagan took the seat across from him, her green eyes flashing with annoyance.</p><p>\u201cEllie\u2019s joining us,\u201d Adam informed her, his tone brooking no argument \u201cSorry,\u201d I mumbled apologetically to her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d Adam replied firmly. \u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to apologize for.\u201d</p><p>The waiters quickly brought over our plates and as we dug in Adam asked me about Christian.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I sighed after swallowing a piece of tender meat. \u201cUp until forty minutes ago I thought he was perfect. Forty minutes ago I didn\u2019t know he\u2019d try to order my food for me or talk incessantly about himself.\u201d</p><p>Adam grinned. \u201cWas it about his hair? I bet he could get a good forty minutes out of how long it took him to get that quiff just right\u2014what styling mousse he uses and why, the amount he uses in order to get just the right amount of height and curvature...\u201d</p><p>I was giggling like an idiot as he continued to tease me. It was true. Christian had a rather large quiff. Forty minutes ago I\u2019d thought it spoke of his individuality and style. Now, I was guessing Adam was right. The man probably spent more time on his hair than I did and that was never a good thing.</p><p>Throughout the meal Adam made me laugh until I forgot all about my ruined evening. It wasn\u2019t until the waiter came to take our plates away and offer us the dessert menu that I remembered Meagan was even there. She reminded us by scraping her chair back and glaring at Adam. \u201cI just remembered I have an early morning. Thanks for dinner, Adam. I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</p><p>Before Adam could say anything she\u2019d turned on her designer heels and stormed out of the restaurant.</p><p>I instantly felt terrible. Adam and I hadn\u2019t included her in our conversation at all. It was such a shitty thing to do.</p><p>Adam must have recognized my guilty expression because he shook his head at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad, sweetheart. She started complaining the moment I picked her up. If I was rude, it was only in retaliation.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a sympathetic smile. \u201cLooks like we saved each other from crappy dates then.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cLooks like.\u201d His eyes dropped to the menu. \u201cNow, what are you having for dessert?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to,\u201d I told him quietly. \u201cWe could just pay up and I\u2019ll go home and let you get on with your night.\u201d</p><p>His eyes rose to meet mine and he gave me an \u201care you daft?\u201d look. \u201cEls, shut up and pick a dessert.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed a smile and lowered my eyes to the menu.</p><p>*** We stepped out into the warm summer night, and Adam took my arm and tucked it in his.</p><p>\u201cWhere to next?\u201d</p> <p>I blinked in surprise. We\u2019d finished our meal and I\u2019d just assumed I\u2019d be going home.</p><p>\u201cUm, where do you fancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Voodoo Rooms is only a five minute walk away and I know the bartenders so we\u2019ll get a seat.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, trying to stop my heart from taking off. Adam was taking me out for a drink.</p><p>He\u2019d never taken me out for a drink just the two of us before. Recently he, Braden and I would meet up for a drink or two but never just Adam and I.</p><p>As I walked down the street with him, arm and arm, I allowed myself the fantasy that we were a couple. That\u2019s what other people would see when they passed us. My chest squeezed with utter longing.</p> <p>Unrequited love wasn\u2019t nearly as romantic as the books made it seem.</p><p>\u201cWho don\u2019t you know in this city?\u201d I teased in an attempt to appear normal around him.</p><p>Adam grinned. \u201cThere are a few people I\u2019ve yet to meet.\u201d</p><p>I snorted at that. Adam and Braden called Edinburgh \u201ctheir city\u201d and they almost meant that literally. They had acquaintances everywhere and anytime I was out with one of them we spent half our time greeting people they knew. Some might say that Adam would never have had that kind of relationship with the city if he hadn\u2019t grown up as Braden\u2019s best friend.</p><p>Unlike us, Adam didn\u2019t come from a well-off family. His mum and dad were ordinary folks who never really gave the impression that they\u2019d wanted to be parents. Adam had been an accident. Although they\u2019d never been neglectful or cruel, his parents had been distant, and he\u2019d spent most of his childhood hanging out at Braden\u2019s and bemoaning the summers when Braden was off in Europe with his mother. As soon as Adam turned eighteen and moved into student housing that put him into a lot of debt, his parents had gotten on a plane and moved to Australia. He heard from them once a month. Incidentally, Braden had paid off Adam\u2019s student debt as a graduation present, something he proudly wouldn\u2019t accept until Braden had gotten him drunk and recorded his slurred acceptance on his iPhone. I\u2019d heard the recording.</p><p>He\u2019d said \u201cLove you, mate, you\u2019re beautiful\u201d so many times to Braden I\u2019d almost peed my pants with laughter.</p><p>I knew Adam well enough to know his difference in background didn\u2019t mean anything.</p><p>Even if he hadn\u2019t had Braden there opening all these doors, I believed with his charm and charisma he\u2019d still be a guy that a lot of people knew, liked, wanted to be or wanted to sleep with.</p> <p>When we got to the bar and restaurant, dinner service was just finishing up and the place was crowded.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d a bartender called to him as soon as we walked in and Adam gave him a chin nod. \u201cI\u2019ll get you a table.\u201d</p><p>We followed him as he claimed a table a couple was leaving, wiping it down with a wet dishrag. The guy eyed me as I slid into the booth and then he gave Adam a smile of approval that made me blush to my roots.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a Macallan and ginger ale. Sweetheart, what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a mojito, please.\u201d</p><p>Adam settled into the booth with me, his arm sliding along the back of the seat behind my head. For some reason I felt incredibly awkward and I struggled to find something to say.</p><p>\u201cSorry your date was rubbish.\u201d</p><p>Adam shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll just celebrate with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCelebrate?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a small grin, looking boyishly pleased about something. I felt that look hit me between my legs. I needed help. \u201cI\u2019m now a registered architect.\u201d</p><p>My lips parted on a silent exclamation and I impulsively threw my arms up and around him. \u201cCongratulations!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled against my ear and I shivered, loving the press of those strong, creative hands against my back. \u201cThanks, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Braden know?\u201d I asked, pulling away.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He congratulated me by giving me a permanent contract.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. That was so Braden.</p><p>Adam had gotten his practical experience to complete his qualification by working alongside Braden\u2019s architect. This last year, however, he\u2019d been doing the work himself and having now achieved all the qualifications and experience he required, he\u2019d applied to ARB (Architects Registration Board UK).</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really happy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I\u2019d much rather be here with you than with Megan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeagan,\u201d I corrected.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Adam muttered.</p><p>Our drinks came and I asked him about the project he and Braden were working on now.</p><p>Adam then asked about my classes. I had chosen to study History of Art and Fine Art with grand hopes of becoming a gallery curator one day, but now that I was in the course, at the university, I was falling in love with the idea of a career in academia. Clark, who was a professor of classical history at the university, was extremely proud and excited that I wanted to follow in his footsteps. When I told Braden I was thinking of doing a phD in Art History he\u2019d given me Adam\u2019s \u201care you daft?\u201d look, but then kissed me on the forehead and told me to do whatever made me happy.</p><p>The night seemed to speed away from us and before I knew it I was on my third mojito and snuggled much deeper into Adam\u2019s side, laughing as he regaled me with his and Braden\u2019s antics at work and elsewhere.</p><p>To the outside world the two of them were extremely mature young men in their mid- twenties.</p><p>I knew better.</p><p>I wiped tears of laughter from my eyes and reached for another sip of my drink. \u201cYou two are idiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh, that\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p><p>I grinned back at him and the smile he gave me suddenly froze.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I breathed, my heart stopping.</p><p>He swallowed and shook his head. \u201cI just sometimes wonder where the time has gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. We\u2019re all grown up now,\u201d I teased.</p><p>His eyes searched my face, his expression enigmatic. \u201cYes, we are,\u201d he murmured and something about the way he said it made the air between us grow suddenly charged. I swore I stopped breathing altogether. His eyes were dark and focused and I felt the heat of his look slide sensually down the center of my body. Nervously, I licked my lips and his gaze dropped to my mouth.</p><p>My gaze dropped to his.</p><p>I don\u2019t know which one of us moved. Me to him, or him to me? Both of us moved?</p><p>Whichever one of us it was, our faces were so close our lips were almost brushing. I could feel his breath on mine and he obviously could feel mine on his. The smell of Macallan and Adam played chaos with my hormones. My chest began to rise and fall with excited nerves and hopeful anticipation.</p><p>I moved my head that little bit closer and our lips brushed. Infinitesimally. Still, that slightest touch sent a bolt of lust straight through me.</p><p>Adam made a sound in the back of his throat and I swore he was about to close the distance between us... ...but I\u2019d never know for sure. His phone rang in his jacket pocket throwing a bucket of ice cold water over the moment. I jerked back and watched his face cloud over as he realized what had almost happened. Jaw clenched, he reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone but it had already stopped ringing. He lifted his eyes to me and told me darkly, \u201cBraden.\u201d</p><p>I guessed he meant that Braden had been the one who\u2019d called him, but I also guessed it had a double meaning. I knew I was right when he quickly paid for our drinks and put me in a taxi, abruptly ending our night together.</p><p>I was Ellie, Braden\u2019s little sister. To Adam I would always be Braden\u2019s little sister, and that meant I was off limits.</p><p>When I laid in bed that night I cursed Adam Sutherland to hell and back. If he hadn\u2019t already ruined things for me before, he definitely had after tonight.</p><p>A lip brush.</p><p>One tiny lip brush and I felt that spark I\u2019d been waiting on since I was fifteen and I kissed Pete Robertson on bowling night. Whatever guy came next had a lot to live up to.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>\u201cI was freaking out,\u201d Adam admitted. He threw me a wicked smile. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so hard in my life from a lip brush. I wanted to fuck you every time I saw you after that.\u201d</p><p>I shoved him playfully, blushing. Adam was often deliberately crude because he knew it made me equal parts embarrassed and turned on. I\u2019d always hated when people used the \u201cf- word\u201d to describe sex, thinking it emotionless and casual. But after Adam and I became a couple I\u2019d discovered that when you were in love with someone and you knew they loved you back there were different levels to sex. At one end of the spectrum there was the tender, sweet, slow sex that I would call \u201cmaking love\u201d and at the other end of it there was the rough, wild, can\u2019t-get-enough-of-you sex that was definitely the \u201cf-word\u201d. Adam was more than proficient in both kinds.</p><p>I thought about what he\u2019d said and frowned. \u201cYou did a good job of hiding it.\u201d</p><p>He harrumphed. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d He looked back at the diary and frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat ever happened to that Christian guy, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let him down gently when he called to reschedule our date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would say \u201cpoor guy\u201d but I had to endure five years of wanting you and not having you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was entirely your own fault.\u201d I searched for the diary I wanted and once finding it, found the entry easily since it was a night I would not likely ever forget, \u201cNine months before Joss showed up... it\u2019s a perfect example of it being entirely your own fault.\u201d</p><p>Sunday, October 23rd That\u2019s it. I give up. I\u2019m humiliated. Confused and humiliated. And hurt. God... hurt doesn\u2019t even cover it... I was supposed to be spending my Saturday evening with Jenna and a few girls from uni sipping cocktails and talking about anything else but our degrees. Instead, I was in a taxi heading to Adam\u2019s duplex apartment in Fountain Bridge. I could have walked there, but I felt a sense of urgency to get there and make sure he was okay.</p><p>And I really needed to thank him for having my back, like he always had my back.</p> <p>The last week had not been a particularly good one. That was putting it mildly.</p><p>I\u2019d been betrayed. Again. But this time it was worse than ever. For the last five months I\u2019d been dating Rich Stirling. For the last five months I\u2019d thought I was dating a nice guy who worked in Glasgow for a recruitment agency. I\u2019d only just discovered that in actuality he was a corporate spy for a competitor of Braden\u2019s in Edinburgh. This property developer was so desperate to outbid Braden on a piece of coveted land down by Commercial Quay that they\u2019d enlisted Rich to get close to me, to get close to Braden, to unearth Braden\u2019s bid and offer more money for the land.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t in love with Rich but I\u2019d let the sleazeball into my life, into my bed, and I\u2019d given him a piece of me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever felt so completely stupid in my entire life. All of my friends and family kept telling me I was too nice, that I didn\u2019t have good intuition when it came to people, that I let a-holes into my life, and I was finally starting to believe they were right.</p><p>I could close down, refuse to let people close, be smarter, more selective... but that wasn\u2019t me, and that was somehow letting Rich win. So I refused to change and there was a tiny sense of victory in that, at least.</p><p>It still stung like a mother that I couldn\u2019t do anything, couldn\u2019t take some kind of retribution. So when Braden turned up at my flat \u2014 this gorgeous property on Dublin Street that he\u2019d renovated and then allowed me to stay in rent-free \u2014 to tell me he and Adam had bumped into Rich out on the town the night before, I\u2019d held my breath, knowing exactly what was coming. Sure enough, Braden had had to haul Adam off of Rich and take him home to calm him down and ice his knuckles. Apparently, Adam had let the whole world know how he felt about anyone betraying me. He didn\u2019t like it. And when he didn\u2019t like it, he\u2019d acquaint your face with his dislike.</p> <p>As soon as Braden left I buzzed around my flat in a tizzy, wondering what I should do.</p><p>Should I call Adam and thank him? Should I go to his place and thank him in person? Should I berate him for using violence to make a point? No, that last one definitely wouldn\u2019t wash with him. He wasn\u2019t a violent person. In fact, although he could be intimidating and had warned off a number of bullies when I was younger, this was the first time I knew of that he\u2019d actually gotten physical with someone on my behalf. I\u2019d half expected him to go after Rich. Adam had exploded and stormed out of my mum and Clark\u2019s house when Braden relayed the news to them all. Braden had told them after he told me but my throat was still tight with tears as I had to hear it a second time.</p><p>After Braden\u2019s departure, I finally made the decision to cancel my night out with the girls.</p><p>I jumped into the shower, blow-dried my hair straight, and threw on a long skirt with a low waistband, my Uggs, and a wooly turtleneck with a cropped hem. I wanted to be casual, of course, but whenever I knew I\u2019d be seeing Adam, I liked to remind him in some way that I was a woman with a woman\u2019s figure. Not that it made any real impact. Despite evidence that he checked me out sometimes, Adam had been carefully platonic in our interactions since our lip brush three years ago. I had dated three guys in a bid to get over him. It never worked.</p><p>The guys just paled in comparison to him and the relationships fizzled out.</p><p>With a mind to the cold, I\u2019d thrown on a short wool jacket over my top, along with a scarf, and I\u2019d flagged down a taxi outside my flat. It was only as the cab was pulling up to Adam\u2019s place that I thought maybe I should have called to warn him I was coming over. It was a Saturday night. He might have company.</p> <p>My stomach lurched unpleasantly at the thought. The last time I\u2019d visited Adam unannounced had been four months ago, and I\u2019d walked in on him with a girl called Vicky.</p><p>Not only was I horrified once more to play witness to one of his sexual interludes, but I\u2019d been shocked to realize that he and my brother shared women. Not at the same time, thank God. I knew they shared (and I didn\u2019t want to know if it was a reoccurring thing) because Braden had been seeing Vicky for three months. In an effort to soothe my severely bruised romantic notions, Adam had explained Braden and Vicky were really casual and when Vicky had said she fancied Adam, Braden had mentioned it to his friend and Adam had\u2014la, la, la, la, la, la, la! I didn\u2019t hear the rest of the explanation because I had indeed stuck my fingers childishly in my ears and \u201cla, la-ed\u201d at him.</p><p>Sex was not casual to me. Not only was I annoyed that my brother, who had once been a secret romantic, had turned into a serial monogamist, I was even more annoyed at Adam for encouraging it. I couldn\u2019t even describe how angry I was at Vicky.</p><p>After asking the cab driver to wait a second, I pulled out my phone and called up to Adam.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sweetheart,\u201d he greeted me, his rich voice filled with concern. He was clearly still worried about how I was coping with Rich\u2019s treachery.</p><p>\u201cHullo,\u201d I replied quietly, letting the warmth of hearing his voice fill my chest. \u201cI\u2019m downstairs. Are you okay for me to come up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll buzz you in.\u201d</p><p>I hung up, paid the taxi driver and hopped out, my heart racing as I hurried to the entrance doors just as Adam let me in. My palms began to sweat as the lift took me up to his floor. It was strange but my reaction to being alone with Adam had only gotten worse over the last few years. Every time was like a first date, and yet I knew him better than I knew practically anyone.</p> <p>When the lift doors opened my eyes met Adam\u2019s. He was standing in his doorway across the hall, his arms crossed over his chest as he leaned his shoulder against the doorjamb. He wore a plain white T-shirt and a pair of old jeans, his feet bare, his hair mussed, and he needed a shave.</p><p>He was so bloody hot it was a wonder I didn\u2019t start hyperventilating on the spot.</p><p>I crossed the hallway to him and held out the bottle of wine I\u2019d brought him. He took it with a quizzical smile and I sighed. \u201cIt was either a bottle of wine or a slap on the wrist.\u201d I eyed his bruised knuckles pointedly.</p><p>Adam\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cWine will do.\u201d</p><p>I followed him into the duplex, my eyes drinking in the space as always. A large open staircase greeted you at the front entrance, leading up to two spacious bedrooms, a bathroom and an office. Beyond the staircase on the ground floor was just wide open space\u2014a massive sitting area with floor-to-ceiling glass windows covering one wall, and at the very end of the room a stylish kitchen with an island, breakfast bar, and a dining table and chairs.</p><p>It was a luxurious property and one he could more than afford. Not only did Braden pay him extremely well, Adam had invested in his own rental properties these last two years and it supplemented his income nicely.</p><p>I took another look around the large space, smirking. Unlike my flat, Adam\u2019s was completely clutter-free. All items were carefully chosen and had their place. In fact, if I didn\u2019t know first-hand that he was the straightest straight guy ever (well, with the exception of Braden), Adam\u2019s duplex might convince me otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll crack this open... I feel a lecture coming on.\u201d His voice was teasing as he wandered toward the kitchen.</p><p>As I shrugged out of my jacket and took off my scarf, I tilted my head and watched his delicious arse walk away from me. The man had the most perfect bottom in the history of all bottoms. Laying my jacket over his huge corner sofa, I wandered toward the kitchen, watching as he pulled two glasses out of a cupboard and began to pour wine into them. Adam turned just as I reached him and I saw his eyes flicker over the bare skin between the hem of my top and the waistband of my skirt before quickly shifting away. I gave myself a secret smug smile. Good wardrobe choice.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said somewhat gruffly, handing me a glass.</p><p>Our eyes met as we each took a sip of wine, and as I lowered my glass I told him solemnly, \u201cI came here to thank you.\u201d</p><p>Adam shook his hand. \u201cEllie, you don\u2019t need to thank me.\u201d His face darkened. \u201cIt was my pleasure, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBraden said he had a hard time pulling you off of Rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe fucked with you, Els. I mean he really fucked with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiterally,\u201d I murmured and Adam stiffened.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he warned me. \u201cI\u2019m this close to finishing the scumbag off.\u201d</p><p>I felt a small thrill go through me at the sincerity in his voice. I loved that Adam cared this much. He might not be willing to see me as anything but Braden\u2019s wee sister, but it was a nice consolation prize to know he had some feelings for me. \u201cI should be reprimanding you.\u201d</p><p>I reached for his free hand, using his wounds as an excuse to touch him, and lifted it closer to me for inspection. His knuckles weren\u2019t just bruised, they were swollen, and the middle one had a small, healing gash in it. I hissed in a breath. \u201cHow many times did you hit him?\u201d</p><p>Adam stepped closer, staring at his hand in mine. \u201cI hit the wall next to his head as a warning shot. He didn\u2019t heed the warning, said shit he really shouldn\u2019t have, and I think I got in four really good hits before Braden pulled me off.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my gaze to his face, no longer feeling the thrill. \u201cDid you leave him conscious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely.\u201d Adam\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you care?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get in trouble.\u201d</p><p>His expression softened and he gently tugged his hand free from mine. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart, according to sources I was nowhere near New Town or Rich last night. We\u2019ve got a dozen witnesses who will all claim that I was at Bar Khol last night at the time of the said attack.\u201d</p><p>I nodded but worried my top lip with my teeth.</p> <p>\u201cEls, how are you really?\u201d Adam asked softly, tentatively.</p><p>Instead of answering right away, I turned around and slowly made my way toward his comfy sofa, listening to him follow behind me. I settled on the couch and Adam sat down close to me, relaxing his arm along the back of it. Finally, I met his gaze and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s eyebrows puckered and his mouth got tight. \u201cYou\u2019re not an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d I insisted. \u201cI\u2019m stupid and na\u00efve and... humiliated.\u201d</p><p>He slid closer to me, his fingers touching my wrist gently in comfort. \u201cYou have nothing to be humiliated about. He\u2019s a prick who played you. He\u2019s the idiot. He\u2019s the stupid fuck who\u2019s going to look back and realize that for five months he was the luckiest bastard on this planet to be with you. He\u2019ll regret this, baby.\u201d</p> <p>Baby.</p><p>For a moment I forgot how to breathe. Adam had never called me \u201cbaby\u201d before. There was something somehow intimate about the endearment. I liked it. I liked it a helluva lot.</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cYou always know the exact right thing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I only ever tell the truth. You\u2019re one of a kind, Els. Any guy would be lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>I gazed into his eyes feeling his words like a caress across my body and as I stared his gaze flickered over me again, surreptitiously checking me out before he took another sip of wine. It occurred to me that perhaps all Adam needed was a push. Yes, I was Braden\u2019s wee sister, but I was also Ellie, the girl he apparently thought the world of and admitted he thought was beautiful. Blame it on the wine or the fact that he\u2019d stood up for me once again, I wanted him and had decided impulsively that I was tired of hiding the fact.</p><p>I let Adam make me feel better as we finished off our glasses of wine. An hour had passed before I knew it and I had kicked off my Uggs and curled up on his sofa, sitting close to him.</p> <p>His arm still rested along the back of the sofa and every time I laughed I touched his bicep or squeezed his knee. I was an affectionate person, tactile and open, but it was more than that, and Adam knew it. I could see it in his eyes as we chatted and I hoped my plan was working.</p><p>You would think hurt and betrayal would make me shy away from opening myself up and laying it all out there but I just didn\u2019t have it in me to close myself off. It wasn\u2019t who I was, and I definitely didn\u2019t want to be that way with Adam.</p><p>As the hour drifted into two, I became more determined than ever that tonight things were going to change between me and Adam. I was sick of dating guys I couldn\u2019t seem to fall in love with, and even sicker of being duped by them.</p><p>Adam was in the middle of telling me about the Skype chat he\u2019d had with his mum a week ago and his parent\u2019s plans to return to the UK for a few weeks in April, when I stretched my arms up, pretending to need to crack my back. The movement pulled the hemline of my top up, baring my flat stomach, and it also pushed my breasts out. When I brought my head back down and relaxed, Adam had stopped talking and I could see a muscle ticking in his jaw.</p><p>\u201cEllie, what the fuck are you doing?\u201d he asked hoarsely, his voice quiet.</p><p>Although my face burned with the possibility of rejection I shrugged nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cStretching.\u201d</p><p>His gaze drifted down my body and I watched his own tense. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about. The touching, the flirting, the stretching...\u201d</p> <p>Heart pounding I shifted closer to him on the couch until my knees touched his outer thigh. I licked my lips, nervous but completely turned on just by the mere thought of him touching me back. \u201cI think you know,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Our eyes met... and clung. The air thickened between us. Adam swallowed hard. \u201cEllie,\u201d</p><p>he breathed.</p><p>Holding his gaze I reached a trembling hand out and placed it on his thigh and slowly I moved it up, caressing him. It had almost reached the heat of his crotch where to my utter satisfaction and delight I watched his erection strain against his zipper, when his strong hand grabbed mine tightly.</p><p>I\u2019d barely let out a surprised gasp when he tugged on my wrist, yanking me against him. I collapsed on him and he used my momentary disorientation to his advantage\u2014 he gripped the nape of my neck and slammed my mouth hungrily down on his.</p><p>I melted against him. Just melted.</p><p>My fingers sank into his hair, and I rearranged my legs so I was straddling his lap. My body sank into his. My mouth sank into his.</p><p>It was everything and more than I\u2019d always imagined.</p><p>My skin burned and my nerve endings sparked and I was tingling all over. Adam tasted of wine and heat and... home. I moaned into his mouth and Adam\u2019s arms tightened around my waist, somehow drawing me even closer, the kiss changing from passionate to dirty in a nanosecond. It was suddenly biting and wet, our tongues tangling and licking and learning every inch of one another\u2019s mouths.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t close enough.</p><p>As we continued to kiss, everything lost in a fog of sexual chemistry so electric I would never again doubt romance novels, I felt his rough hands on my ankles, coasting along the skin of my calves, and up the back of my thighs as he drew my skirt free of our tangle and bunched it around my waist. Those hands of his caressed my bottom, giving me a squeeze that sent a streak of heat between my legs and made me gasp into his mouth.</p><p>Adam groaned and put pressure on my hips, pushing me down on his lap so his hard-on rubbed me directly between the legs, nothing between us but denim and the thin cotton of my underwear. I sought the delicious friction, riding him until our mouths parted in brief increments to catch our breaths.</p><p>Needing closer, needing him inside of me I sank down on him and dug my fingers into his shoulders as I rubbed harder.</p><p>Adam growled and broke away from me to tug my top off. I raised my arms, our movements hurried and frantic as he divested me of my top and then my bra. He cupped my breasts in his hands and I arched my back into his touch.</p><p>\u201cSo perfect,\u201d he murmured hoarsely, \u201cSo fucking perfect.\u201d He captured my nipple into his hot mouth and I cried out at the rush of pleasure that coursed through me, pushing me closer and closer to orgasm.</p><p>My being so turned on seemed to fire Adam up. After I cried out I found myself flat on my back on the length of the couch and watched threw hazy, lust-blurred vision as Adam whipped off his shirt and pulled down my skirt and pants. The muscles of his ripped abs flexed deliciously and I felt another rush of wetness between my legs.</p><p>He was so goddamned beautiful it wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>Our lips met again as he braced himself over me, my hard nipples brushing his naked chest, my legs spread to fit him between them. He still wore his jeans, and the coarseness of the denim was sensual torture against my naked skin.</p><p>As our kisses grew even more desperate I sought what I wanted from him, finding the button and zipper on his jeans and undoing it. I pushed at his boxers, my hand sliding inside to grasp him and tug him out. He was throbbing and hot and hard and I couldn\u2019t believe this was actually finally happening. Now I knew everything about him.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he groaned against my lips, his hips thrusting as I pressed the mushroomed head of him against my clit. I let go of him to grasp his lower back, tilting my own hips up as he teased me. He kissed me again, hard, and I felt his erection slide down... I spread my thighs wider and smoothed my hands down his muscular back to push his jeans further down. I grasped his buttocks and pulled him to me. \u201cAdam, please,\u201d I begged.</p><p>\u201cAdam...\u201d</p><p>He froze. Instantly. His name on my lips bringing him out of the magical sexual fog.</p><p>Our eyes met as he pulled his head up, his body hovering over mine, his muscles trembling with tension. While I imagined my expression was one of confusion, Adam\u2019s was one of horror.</p><p>It was a look that made me want to crawl inside of myself.</p><p>It hurt like nothing I\u2019d ever experienced before.</p><p>He scrambled off of me, pulling his boxers and jeans up and then tossing my skirt at me to cover me somewhat. \u201cEllie, we can\u2019t.\u201d He shook his head and practically jumped off the couch, grabbing his T-shirt and yanking it back on.</p><p>I was feeling a mixture of things\u2014confusion, hurt, sexual frustration\u2014and so I was slow in sitting up.</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Ellie, get dressed,\u201d Adam snapped harshly and it took everything within me not to flinch... not to cry.</p><p>As I pulled on my clothes with trembling hands Adam exhaled. \u201cSweetheart, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to...\u201d his voice was heavy with regret.</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything, I just straightened my clothes and reached for my Uggs, trying to hold myself together. I couldn\u2019t fall apart in front of him. I just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cEllie?\u201d</p><p>Finally I looked at him as I stood. He looked as heartbroken as I felt. It was a small kind of consolation.</p><p>\u201cEllie, your Braden\u2019s wee sister. I can\u2019t... we can\u2019t...\u201d he gestured helplessly to the couch before running a hand through his hair.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I realized something absolutely tragic. While I thought what was happening was something borne out of affection, attraction and, yes, love, to Adam what had almost happened was something borne out of lust. He didn\u2019t want to make love to me. He wanted to screw me.</p><p>Pain lodged itself in my throat and I knew I was five seconds from bursting into big, fat, hopeless tears. I spun away from him and rounded the couch, my long hair covering my face as I grabbed at my jacket, heading to the door.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d Adam called out in panic but I was already yanking his front door open. \u201cEllie.</p><p>Fuck!\u201d I heard him curse as I slammed the door shut behind me and bolted down the stairwell, knowing the lift might not arrive in time for me to make my quick escape. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The tears were pouring down my cheeks as I raced down the stairs, trying to hold in the gusty sobs that were ready to blow.</p><p>\u201cEllie, please!\u201d Adam was suddenly in the stairwell, his footsteps pounding hard behind me.</p><p>I ran faster, ignoring his shouts for me to come back and talk to him.</p> <p>By the time he made it out of the building I was already racing across the street toward a bus that was about to pull off. I got on it and the doors closed behind me. I sagged in relief and glanced absentmindedly at the route number.</p><p>I didn\u2019t care where it was going as long as it took me far, far away from the biggest mistake I\u2019d ever made.</p><p>*** There had been a few times in my teen years I\u2019d cried myself to sleep. A couple of those times had even been over Adam. But when I was a teenager, like most teenagers, anything remotely negative seemed like the complete and total end of the world. Thankfully that flair for the drama usually disappears as you enter adulthood. It did for me anyway. So when I say I sobbed myself to sleep that night, it was without a sense of faux melodrama. The pain inside of me was real. It was genuine. It was raw.</p><p>For a good eight hours I believed that not only had I been given 100% proof positive that Adam Sutherland didn\u2019t love me the way that I loved him, I also believed that I\u2019d ruined us and destroyed one of my favorite things in the whole world \u2014my friendship with him.</p><p>I barely slept and woke up early to make myself tea, sitting in my big flat alone and puffy- faced wearing mismatched socks on my feet and a broken crocodile clip in my hair.</p> <p>A pounding on the front door made me jump and sent hot tea over the rim of my mug and splashing onto my skin. I bit back a curse and placed the mug carefully on the table, scurrying out of the room and into the darkened hall.</p><p>\u201cEllie, open up!\u201d Adam shouted through the thick wood. \u201cEllie!\u201d</p><p>I wanted to talk to him. I wanted to somehow fix things and rewind the clock, but I knew if I let him inside the flat he\u2019d take one look at my face and realize that I, Ellie Nichols Carmichael, was completely and utterly in love with him and that last night had devastated me.</p><p>So I didn\u2019t open the door. I leaned against the wall in my hallway and slid down until I was sitting on the cold hardwood floor. I listened as Adam pounded my door and called my name. I listened as my phone rang in my bedroom. I listened as Adam left a message on it. I listened as he walked away... When I woke up I was curled up on the cold floor. I blinked, trying to get my bearings and as I did, everything came flooding back. I didn\u2019t have time to dwell on it, however, because I realized what had woken me up was my phone ringing. I got to my feet with a groan, my back and neck hurting from my awkward sleeping position, and I ran into my room to pick it up. According to the clock on my phone I\u2019d been asleep for just over two hours.</p><p>My stomach flipped at the sight of the picture of Adam on my phone. I sucked in a deep breath and answered it.</p><p>\u201cEllie, thank fuck,\u201d he breathed in relief and I could just imagine him tugging at his hair in anxiety. \u201cI came by earlier.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was sleeping. I had more wine last night so I was kind of dead to the world,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cEls, I don\u2019t even know where to start. I\u2019m so sorry. God, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t lose you, Els. I can\u2019t believe I fucked up like this but you have to forgive me. I can\u2019t lose you.\u201d</p><p>When he said stuff like that it made it hard to hate him. Worse it made it harder to get over him. But I knew from now on that I really needed to try. And not just say that I was going to try. I had to try. I couldn\u2019t live my life pining after him. So I made my decision to do just that. \u201cAdam, it\u2019s okay,\u201d I promised him softly. \u201cIt was a mistake. We got carried away in the moment. And I\u2019m sorry for running out on you. I was just embarrassed, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>I heard his heartfelt sigh of relief and attempted to force the sting of tears out of my nose.</p><p>\u201cEls, you\u2019ve nothing to be embarrassed about, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo...\u201d his voice grew even quieter. \u201cWe\u2019re good. We\u2019re still us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still us,\u201d I managed, blinking back tears.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want there to be any awkwardness between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be. I won\u2019t let there be if you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, Sweetheart. Good. We\u2019ll just forget this. It didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>I choked back the pain. \u201cRight. It didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a car crash,\u201d Adam sighed, scrubbing a hand over his face as he handed me back the diary. \u201cIt\u2019s painful reading this from your perspective but I can\u2019t look away.\u201d He pointed to another diary. \u201cI want to know more.\u201d</p><p>Not liking the strain etched into his features I shook my head. \u201cAdam, we\u2019re past all this. I didn\u2019t mean for this to be painful. I just thought... well now that I have you I can take a step back and look at the pieces of our history without it hurting. And you know me.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThe angst of it all seems romantic.\u201d Then I frowned. \u201cBut you\u2019re obviously not taking it that way so I\u2019m going to put these away.\u201d</p><p>He clamped a large hand down on mine as I moved to lift the diaries. I glanced up at him and he shook his head with a small smile. \u201cIt\u2019s painful to read how my stupidity hurt you at the time, but I like being inside your head. I like knowing that while I was struggling with the fact that I had fallen in love with my best friend\u2019s little sister, she loved me back more than I could ever hope to deserve.\u201d</p><p>I grinned at him. \u201cOne: you deserve it. And two,\u201d I gestured to the diaries, to the story of us, \u201cIt is totally romantic, right?\u201d</p><p>Adam laughed, shaking his head at my single-minded determination to turn us into a romance novel. \u201cMaybe. But don\u2019t tell anyone I said so. It\u2019ll ruin my reputation.\u201d</p><p>I pushed through the diaries looking for the familiar purple leather of the last one. \u201cBaby, you ruined that reputation when you told Braden Carmichael you were in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCocky bastard knew all along,\u201d Adam muttered unhappily. \u201cCould have saved us a couple of months of worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean,\u201d I found the diary and paged through it, \u201cA couple of months of you being a mercurial pain in my arse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a nice way to put it. But let\u2019s not forget I wasn\u2019t the only pain in the arse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I did was start dating again, and it took me ten months to do it after our little couch scene. You got off easy.\u201d I thrust the diary at him and he took it with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cI was staking my claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were peeing all around your territory without actually staking a claim.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and bent his head over the latest page without responding... because he knew I was bloody right.</p><p>Sunday, August 13th I haven\u2019t had time to write anything down for a few days, partly because of studies and partly because my seething anger has been taking up quite a lot of my time. You see, it all started on Friday afternoon when a casual conversation with Nicholas ended in me wanting to strangle Adam... As Joss and I walked toward The Meadows where we were meeting Braden, Adam, Jenna and Ed for a picnic, I considered telling her what I\u2019d discovered about Adam yesterday while I was having coffee with my fellow student and friend, Nicholas. I didn\u2019t get the chance to tell her yesterday because she\u2019d been working at Club 39. I knew Joss would be pissed off for me and I needed that fire, I needed motivation to put Adam at an arm\u2019s length and see how he liked it.</p><p>It had taken me and Adam a few months to get past the awkwardness of almost having sex, and even then things weren\u2019t the same. If I thought about it, things hadn\u2019t been the same for a while. I think maybe since the lip brush incident when I was nineteen.</p><p>Anyway, I knew obviously that Adam had slept with other girls since he\u2019d had me on his couch and it hurt worse than I could ever explain. The whole incident made it difficult for me to move on and I hadn\u2019t. I hadn\u2019t been on a single date in ten months.</p><p>That was all about to change, however. After making a crack to Nicholas about my dry spell he\u2019d told me maybe I\u2019d have better luck getting a date if my friend Adam would stop going around intimidating men out of asking. Surprised and to say the least, confused, by this comment I\u2019d asked him to elaborate only to discover that Nicholas had wanted to ask me out months ago. Knowing how close I was to Braden and Adam, but feeling Adam the safer choice, he\u2019d called Adam and asked him for advice on where to take me out. Adam\u2019s response had been, \u201cStay away from Ellie or I\u2019ll break your face.\u201d</p><p>What the hell was that?</p><p>Seriously?</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even begin to process how not cool that was. He was warning perfectly nice guys away from me? So he was allowed to manwhore his way through Edinburgh but I wasn\u2019t allowed to go on a single date? I didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>I wanted to tell Joss all that. Despite being incredibly secretive about her past, Joss had proven herself straightforward. I needed her to tell me if it was okay or not to play a little dirty with Adam. Honestly, I was just so tired of being the nice girl that he could just walk all over, knowing I\u2019d still love him in the end. His actions had proven that he could be possessive of me, which meant he thought of me as \u201chis\u201d in some small way. Well, I wanted to show him that I wasn\u2019t his. I wouldn\u2019t ever be his unless he decided he wanted more than a one night stand.</p><p>All this I wanted to confide in Joss that sunny Saturday as we strolled to The Meadows but Joss was distracted by something so I decided it wasn\u2019t a good time. I was curious whether Joss\u2019s distraction had something to do with Braden. She\u2019d been acting strangely around him, strangely enough for even me to notice during the aftermath of one of my headaches. We\u2019d been book shopping with Hannah when it happened. The headache hit me out of the blue like it had been doing for the last couple of months. It was horrible and usually accompanied by tingling and numbness in my arm. When it passed I was exhausted. In fact, lately my energy levels hadn\u2019t been great. I kept meaning to go to the doctor but every time I got this ominous churning in my gut, and I put it off, promising myself I\u2019d make an appointment the next day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anyway, the headache hit and Joss was concerned\u2014she didn\u2019t fool me with her \u2018I don\u2019t care about people\u2019 rubbish\u2014and taking me to get some food in me. We bumped into Braden and Vicky. While I was pissed off that Braden had slept with her again and brought her back into our lives (and Adam\u2019s orbit), I still noticed the tension between Joss and Braden.</p><p>Admittedly when they\u2019d first met I\u2019d had hopes of playing matchmaker but recent revelations had spoiled my hopes. However, Braden still asked an awful lot of questions about Joss and he stared at her (a lot), and I was beginning to suspect that, despite denials from both of them, something was going on. I didn\u2019t know how to feel about that now that I knew Joss wasn\u2019t keen on being in a relationship. It was difficult to pin down her true feelings about anything and I didn\u2019t want either Braden or her to get hurt.</p><p>Deciding to bite my tongue about a lot of things I kept our conversation cheerful as we approached our friends. Braden, Adam, Jenna and Ed were already there, sitting on a large chenille blanket with two picnic hampers beside them. My eyes immediately went to Adam and then quickly moved to Braden when I discovered Adam was watching me.</p> <p>I laughed as Joss teased Braden upon our arrival, something not many people outside of our family dared to do and I loved that Joss did. I think secretly my big brother did too.</p><p>Without thinking about it I flopped down onto the blanket beside Adam. His strong arm came around me instantly and he squeezed me affectionately against his side. \u201cNice to see you, Els.\u201d</p><p>The whole point of the picnic was to catch up with Adam and Braden since they\u2019d been working so hard on the new development we\u2019d barely seen them these last few weeks. I missed them both, I did. I missed Adam, and inhaling the familiar smell of him and feeling his strength pressed against my right side, I almost forgot for a moment my earlier resolve.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you too.\u201d I gave him a half-hearted smile and pulled casually out of his embrace. I turned to Jenna and Ed to greet them properly, ignoring the sudden tension radiating from Adam. He knew me too well, and he immediately understood something was wrong.</p> <p>Good.</p><p>Hearing Joss tell Braden she needed to take a rain check on the picnic, worry brought my head around to her. I gazed up at her in concern, suddenly wondering if there had been more to her distraction earlier than I\u2019d previously thought. \u201cIs everything okay? Do you need me to come?\u201d</p><p>Joss shook her head, and waved her phone at me. \u201cNo, I\u2019m okay. Rhian just really needs someone to talk to. It can\u2019t wait. Sorry.\u201d She was avoiding Braden\u2019s eyes for some reason and when I glanced at my brother I found him studying Joss in a weird way. Did he not believe her? Why not? Rhian was Joss\u2019s best friend. She stayed in London and had been having personal problems lately, so it was completely plausible that she needed to talk. \u201cSee you later.\u201d Joss walked away, her long ponytail swaying across her back. Looking back at Braden I watched him watch her in a way that unnerved me. It wasn\u2019t just the fact that he had that determined, focused expression he got on his face when he was going after something\u2014 usually a development and never a woman\u2014it was the glimmer of excitement in his eyes.</p><p>I\u2019d never seen him look at anybody that way. The romantic side of me sighed happily. The practical side of me (and believe it or not I had one) worried her lip between her teeth, thinking Joss and Braden were either the perfect match or a freaking disaster waiting to happen.</p><p>Later, after having frozen Adam out to the point of seriously pissing him off, my suspicions over Braden\u2019s interest were confirmed when he pestered me all the way home about Joss. I knew by the time he\u2019d dropped me off on Dublin Street that he was going after her, and I knew from having grown up with him that when Braden really wanted something he was absolutely relentless, even when he was reaching for the impossible. I could only hope Joss didn\u2019t hurt him while he tried to reach for her.</p><p>*** I\u2019d spent the picnic catching up with Jenna and laughing at Braden and Ed\u2019s jokes. Maybe once in the entire three hours we hung out did I speak directly to Adam, and I avoided his gaze at all costs. That was difficult, considering he was constantly trying to catch it.</p> <p>Thankfully there wasn\u2019t a quiet moment for him to ask me what the hell was wrong with me, so my form of torture worked out even better than I\u2019d planned it.</p><p>I was gratified to discover it was a form of torture because by the time Braden and I left him, Adam\u2019s expression was black with ill humor. Normally, Braden would have noticed our behavior, but much like Joss he was kind of distracted.</p><p>I was even more gratified to discover later, after having a discussion with Joss regarding Braden \u2014I was still unsure of where Joss stood on that one since I thought she was protesting her disinterest just a wee bit too much\u2014and then confiding in her about Adam, that she agreed with me: Adam needed to be taught a lesson. If he didn\u2019t want to be in my life in a romantic sense, then he needed to butt out of my romantic life. I was going to continue my torture that evening.</p><p>Joss was working at the bar while Braden, Adam and I were going out for drinks with Darren, the manager of Braden\u2019s nightclub Fire, and Darren\u2019s wife Donna. I wore a black top that was backless. It was held together by a silk ribbon across the middle of the back, while the front was demure with a high neckline and draped chiffon panel that fell a good three inches past my waist. I\u2019d matched the top with black skinny jeans that were so tight they might as well have been painted on. My hair was pulled up into a messy bun to give maximum impact to the top, and I was wearing four inch silver heels to match the silver tear drop earrings I was wearing.</p><p>It was a little more femme fatale than I usually went for but it did the trick. Adam\u2019s eyes flared when I turned around after greeting Donna, his gaze burning as he took in the full effect of the outfit.</p><p>That just pissed me off.</p><p>What pissed me off even more was Braden\u2019s announcement that we were going to Club 39. Knowing what he was up to regarding Joss, I didn\u2019t feel comfortable letting him unleash his plan while she was busy working. However, Braden wouldn\u2019t listen to me and Donna wanted to check out the bar.</p><p>My annoyance levels increased when Adam held me back as we walked along George Street.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what\u2019s wrong or am I going to have to guess?\u201d he asked, his words clipped.</p><p>I shrugged, not looking at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, don\u2019t. Being a bitch doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d</p><p>I flinched but kept walking. \u201cYou know what else doesn\u2019t suit me? Being single. But apparently that\u2019s not my choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d he hissed, his voice low since we\u2019d gotten closer to Braden.</p><p>I kept my voice low too as I illuminated him, snapping my head around to glare at him.</p><p>\u201cYou know exactly what I\u2019m talking about, you overbearing arsehole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Braden turned around to frown at us.</p><p>I nodded sharply and hurried forward to walk beside him. As we approached Club 39, I sighed, \u201cBraden, I hope you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>He shot me a wicked smile. \u201cAlways do. You know, Darren knows the doorman here.\u201d</p><p>Turning to Darren, Braden set his devious little plan in motion. \u201cDarren, why don\u2019t you go on in ahead and gets us drinks. We\u2019ll find a table.\u201d</p><p>Darren nodded and ignored the complaints from people standing in line as he shoved his way down the narrow steps to the basement bar. He greeted the big guy at the door and they spoke for a few minutes. He turned and pointed up to the street where we were standing and the next thing was we were being waved down the stairs. Darren disappeared inside the club and I watched Braden take Donna\u2019s arm.</p><p>I glowered at his back. Donna was an attractive brunette and Braden was hoping to use her to make Joss jealous. I knew how Braden worked. He liked this idea because it meant that he could use a woman to make Joss jealous without actually getting entangled with another woman. My brother liked reaction, and I was guessing he wanted a big reaction from Joss.</p><p>Part of me hoped she\u2019d deal with it with her usual admirable self-possession.</p><p>Unfortunately my hopes were dashed. As soon as we got inside Club 39 my eyes swung to Joss and I watched her expression harden as Braden leaned down to whisper in Donna\u2019s ear.</p><p>He looked right through Joss and I saw a flicker of something I didn\u2019t like pass in her eyes before she quickly turned away.</p><p>I really wanted to bash my brother\u2019s head against Adam\u2019s.</p><p>More than anything I just wanted to leave the two of them to it. But Adam wouldn\u2019t let me. He pressed me forward as Braden managed to clear us a table and I brushed off his hand, still playing it cool. I strode after Braden and stopped as he and Donna, followed by Adam, slid onto a couch. Standing over them I couldn\u2019t decide which one I wanted to glare at more.</p><p>\u201cEllie, sit your arse down,\u201d I heard Adam snap over the music.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes and shook my head.</p><p>Adam\u2019s expression darkened and before I had a chance to maneuver away from him, he reached up, grabbed my arm and yanked me down beside him. At the feel of his body pressed flushed to my side, I struggled to get away from him but was halted by the sensual brush of his fingers across my bare back as his arm wound around my waist. His hand clamped down on my hip and he forced me closer, his mouth at my ear. \u201cIf you stop acting like a petulant child, I\u2019ll stop being overbearing.\u201d</p><p>I stopped struggling against him but held myself tense so he\u2019d know I was still angry with him. For the next hour he kept me held against him, his grip possessive and definitely more than friendly.</p><p>Braden didn\u2019t even notice. His eyes were burning holes in Joss and her colleague Craig who had started the night off by sharing a kiss and spent the last hour flirting and having fun.</p><p>I liked this side of Joss.</p><p>Braden apparently didn\u2019t. No. He did. He just didn\u2019t like that she was doing it with another guy. The mini-drama playing out before me almost kept my mind off my own, but when Braden, who\u2019d clearly finally had enough, got up and approached the bar when Joss went on break and somehow managed to talk the other bartender into letting him into the staffroom, I was brought back to my own problem with no escape. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Darren and Donna were up at the bar getting more drinks.</p><p>Adam and I were alone on the couch.</p><p>He caressed my hip soothingly, obviously trying to get me to relax. \u201cSo,\u201d he spoke into my ear again, reinforcing the feeling that we were in our own little bubble inside the bar.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to tell me why you\u2019re being a bitch to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling me that,\u201d I snapped, turning my head so our noses were almost touching. I stared into his dark eyes and lost my breath so badly I had to look away.</p><p>\u201cStop acting like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m annoyed,\u201d I explained. \u201cI get to be annoyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you fill me in?\u201d</p> <p>I turned to him again, and this time I don\u2019t think I managed to mask my hurt and confusion over his actions because his own expression softened with concern. \u201cWhy did you threaten Nicholas with physical violence when he came to you for advice about asking me out?\u201d</p><p>Understanding dawned in his eyes and he sighed heavily. \u201cHe\u2019s not good enough for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not up to you to decide.\u201d</p><p>His fingers dug into my hip as they curled in reflex to my response. \u201cIt\u2019s up to me to protect you.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, his words hurting me. \u201cI\u2019m not yours to protect.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s body grew solid next to mine and we sat in awful silence for a moment.</p> <p>The silence was broken when his arm loosened its hold around my waist. I was just turning my head to look at him questioningly when I felt the touch of his fingers against my upper back. Slowly, torturously he skimmed them down my spine and I flushed feeling my nipples harden visibly against the fabric covering my chest. \u201cYou sure about that,\u201d he murmured hoarsely in my ear.</p><p>My eyes widened as I stared into his, a flurry of confusion and questions rioting in my head, none of which I had time to voice before Donna and Darren took a seat next to us with our drinks. Adam\u2019s arm came back around, his hand resting gently on my hip, and I sat there in stunned silence wondering what the hell he\u2019d meant by that.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Adam winced as he looked over at me. \u201cI really did send you some pretty mixed signals.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>He smiled sheepishly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Els. You pissed me off. I was trying to make a point that you were mine. It wasn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cYou were torn. I forgive you. Especially since it makes a really good story.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as I reached for the diary again, flipping through the pages to find the next entry.</p> <p>\u201cThat night at Club 39 wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as the night at Fire.\u201d</p><p>Adam groaned. \u201cDamn, I don\u2019t know if I want to read this from your point of view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get quite detailed.\u201d</p><p>He quirked an eyebrow at me. \u201cDetailed?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, blushing.</p><p>He saw the blush and grinned, pulling the diary out of my hand. \u201cBaby, that\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>Sunday, September 16th I\u2019m done. It\u2019s over. I don\u2019t care what history lies between me and Adam... it\u2019s finally over... I hadn\u2019t been looking forward to the night at Fire because it meant being stuck in a club, watching Adam flirt with everything that moved, but it was a big night for Braden as he was holding a special event for Fresher\u2019s Week, and I promised him I\u2019d be there.</p><p>As per usual he and Joss were so wrapped up in their own stuff they didn\u2019t notice the tension between me and Adam. It was this horribly awkward tension, mixed with sexual frustration, and it had sprung up between us after our clash a little while after the eventful night at Club 39.</p><p>It had happened when I accepted a date with a guy called Jason that I met in Starbucks.</p><p>Jason was hot and seemed nice and I saw no harm in grabbing a drink with him. Except, Braden had informed Adam of my plans and Adam had spent the entire night calling me up with stupid questions. He ruined the date. It was immature and completely outrageous.</p><p>Even more so was the fact that, as Joss so bluntly pointed out, I had rudely kept answering the phone instead of switching it off. The truth was I\u2019d been enjoying Adam\u2019s reaction to my date. Somewhere along the line I had forgotten my vow to move on from him after the night at his apartment, and I was playing our stupid game again. I wanted a reaction from him and I got it. But after chewing him out at my parent\u2019s Sunday lunch the next day, Adam had gone from hot to ice cold. He tried not to be alone with me and when he was alone with me he spoke to me about things you\u2019d chat to a perfect stranger about. It had been wearing on my nerves for weeks, and that along with my worries about school and the recurring headache I couldn\u2019t seem to get rid of, I found myself wanting to lay my frustrations at his feet.</p><p>Everyone else would get nice Ellie, sweet Ellie, the Ellie everyone knew and liked. Adam would get crabby Ellie, tired Ellie, the Ellie with the bitter, broken heart.</p><p>While Braden detained Joss after a small skirmish about her dress (my brother was such an alpha-male idiot sometimes) Adam led me up to a private booth across from the bar. I slid in one side and was surprised when Adam sat down quite close to me.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d I warned him dryly, \u201cI think you\u2019re breaking your one meter distance rule with me.\u201d</p><p>He curled his lip, unimpressed. \u201cDon\u2019t start. Not tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot any night.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed. \u201cYou know why I don\u2019t date, Ellie? So I don\u2019t have to put up with this shit. It\u2019s like being in a fucking relationship without the benefits.\u201d</p><p>Hurt, I gave him the dirtiest look I could muster. \u201cNo, it\u2019s like being in a friendship you broke.\u201d</p><p>Having successfully spread my hurt to him, I felt awful, and feeling awful made me even angrier at him. I didn\u2019t want to care that I hurt his feelings.</p><p>Adam was about to respond when movement drew our heads up and we saw Joss trying to escape our argument. He gave her a look that told her to plant her bottom down beside us and save him from me.</p><p>I was almost as relieved as he was when she sat down on my other side.</p><p>\u201cBraden\u2019s having drinks sent over,\u201d she said, her eyes taking in all the guests. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize he had other friends appearing tonight. I thought it was just us and random people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied absentmindedly, my bad mood causing the rope bridge between my brain and mouth to snap. \u201cSome of his exes as well as his previous friends-with-benefits girls love clubbing. He invited them and a few of his guy friends.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Adam snapped, \u201cEllie, what are you playing at?\u201d and I turned to see him gazing pointedly at Joss that I followed his gaze and saw Joss had frozen at my careless comment.</p><p>Mortified, I hurried to assure her apologetically, \u201cOh crap, Joss, I didn\u2019t mean anything. I mean, those girls don\u2019t mean anything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get drunk,\u201d she announced overly cheerily and I felt unbelievably guilty for making her feel uncomfortable and uncertain of Braden.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. Let\u2019s just wait for Braden,\u201d Adam insisted.</p><p>However, Braden spent an awful long time flirting and chatting with guests and the tension at our table grew so thick we all sought to escape it. Joss and I headed for the dance floor, and I kept her company for a while until I headed to the bar to get some water. As I approached I caught sight of Adam and felt that oh so familiar burn in my throat. He was wearing a black shirt, rolled up at the sleeves, with black dress trousers. It was simple, it was hot. He always looked hot. And tonight he looked hot as he leaned into a girl who was sitting on a stool at the other end of the bar. She had her head tilted back while Adam braced one hand on the bar and leaned in to whisper in her ear. She laughed and he lifted his face so they were almost close enough to kiss. Whatever he murmured to her made her laugh soften to a flirtatious smile and I felt that burn in my throat transform into a lump of tears.</p><p>As if he sensed my gaze Adam\u2019s head lifted and our eyes met. I\u2019d never found it easy to hide my emotions when I was feeling something particularly deeply and I hurried to look away before he caught it.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d One of the bartenders finally approached me.</p><p>\u201cBottle of water,\u201d I replied, my voice hoarse with pain and he had to lean in for me to repeat the order. Just as I handed him money for the water, I felt a hand on my lower back and his cologne hit me seconds before his mouth brushed my ear.</p><p>\u201cEls,\u201d Adam said quietly, his voice thick with emotion.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to respond. My eyes fixed downward on the bottle as I tried to control myself, knowing that every day I was getting closer and closer to forcing our situation into some kind of resolution by putting the truth out there.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, look at me.\u201d</p><p>I did as he asked, searching his face for answers I knew he wasn\u2019t ready to give me, answers he may never be ready to give me.</p><p>He lifted his hand from my back and brushed his knuckles tenderly along my jaw, his eyes following their movement. \u201cThe prettiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>The words stung because they signaled another round on this merry-go-round of mixed signals. I reared back from his touch, grimacing. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his hands. \u201cEllie\u2014\u201d</p><p>I gestured to the girl at the other end of the bar who was now throwing invisible daggers my way. \u201cDid you say that to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEl\u2014\u201d</p><p>A surge of shocked murmurs and shouts interrupted him and we both turned to look over his shoulder to see Braden rearing back from hitting... \u201cGavin,\u201d I gasped.</p><p>Adam immediately took off to be by his friend\u2019s side and I followed, my heart racing for Braden. Gavin had been his and Adam\u2019s friend at school, but he\u2019d grown up into a prize arsehole. Braden, for some reason, felt loyalty to him and kept him around. That was until five years ago when he\u2019d slept with Analise and betrayed Braden.</p><p>Now he was in his nightclub?</p><p>\u201cThat is Gavin.\u201d Braden threw Joss a disgusted look. \u201cThe friend who fucked Analise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why the hell were you talking to him like you know him?\u201d</p><p>Oh dear God, Joss knew him? For a moment I felt absolute panic take over me at the thought of history repeating itself for my brother. But I remembered this was Joss, and despite her flaws, she would never be disloyal. I only had to watch the shock fall across her features at the discovery of who Gavin was to realize that whatever this was, it was a big misunderstanding.</p><p>Well, at least on Joss\u2019s part. I sneered at Gavin.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a trainer at my gym,\u201d Joss explained. \u201cHe helped me once.\u201d She looked up at Braden and as she promised him she had no idea who Gavin was she let her feelings for my brother all hang out. I knew she probably didn\u2019t realize it, would even be mortified if she thought for one second she was making herself transparent. However, I was glad to see it and wished Braden wasn\u2019t so riled up because he didn\u2019t even notice it.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you moved on to better things, Bray.\u201d Gavin peered at Joss in a way that made my skin scrawl and I saw Adam\u2019s shoulders tense in front of me. \u201cHere\u2019s hoping history repeats itself because I\u2019ve wanted between her legs for fucking weeks. How about it, Joss? You fancy shagging a real man?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never witnessed my brother hit someone but he was on Gavin before anyone could stop him. Adam tried his best, but I knew there was a part of him that didn\u2019t want to pull Braden off the sleazy little traitor. But he did, only just managing to keep a grip on Braden when Gavin said something so crude I almost threw a punch.</p><p>By the time security came to drag Gavin out, I thought Adam was going to let Braden go just so his own arms were free to start swinging. And poor Joss. I watched with concern as Braden, bristling with adrenaline and anger the likes I\u2019d never seen in him before, hauled her out of the main club and up the stairs into his private office.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even want to know what was about to happen in there.</p> <p>Instead I stood there, still shaking from the whole thing, as the excited customers and guests returned to enjoying their night. Adam and I were just standing on the dance floor staring at one another. I reckoned we were both trying to work out where we were at, and what the hell had just happened.</p><p>The girl from the bar strolled over to him in a tight jersey dress that showcased a bombshell figure. She was shorter than I was but like Joss she had more hips and ass. I suddenly felt dowdy in my shapeless, shimmery shift dress. Stopping beside Adam, the girl placed a proprietary hand on his arm. \u201cLet me buy you a drink after that.\u201d</p><p>Adam glanced up from her to look to me and desperate not to bleed as openly as I had earlier, I closed my features down and told him flatly, \u201cGo. I\u2019m leaving anyway.\u201d</p><p>I brushed past him before he could reply, pushing through the crowds, and carefully making my way downstairs to the street level. A hand suddenly curled around my bicep as I was about to step outside and I looked up in surprise to see Adam was there with his jacket on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making sure you get home okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t reply and he didn\u2019t let me go. I was too tired to struggle so I let him manhandle me into a taxi and I sat in absolute silence with him as the cab drove us to Dublin Street.</p><p>He paid for the taxi and followed me out and up the front stoop. He waited patiently as I got out my keys and let us in to the dark flat. I took a few steps into the hall, flicked the light switch and turned around, kicking off my heels. \u201cYou can go now.\u201d</p><p>Instead Adam slammed the front door shut behind him and stared at me sullenly.</p><p>I sighed softly, tired of fighting. Mum had always joked I wasn\u2019t a fighter, I was a lover.</p><p>She\u2019d even bought me a T-shirt that said it. \u201cYou can leave now, Adam. Thank you for seeing me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d he suddenly asked, his voice husky with anger.</p><p>I backed up at his tone, hitting the wall, watching warily as he stalked me. My chin tilted, my lips parting in surprise as he placed his hands above my head on the wall and caged me against it. He lowered his head, his nose sliding along mine until his mouth rested just above my lips. I swallowed, finally finding my voice. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>His answer was to crush my lips beneath his.</p> <p>Like the last time he\u2019d kissed me like this, the world just disappeared, taking reality and all the important stuff with it. I wrapped my arms around his neck, my fingers curling into his hair, my breasts pressed hard against his chest as we devoured one another.</p><p>After a while Adam eased our carnal kiss, releasing my swollen mouth to press soft kisses along my jaw and down my neck as his hand slid up the inside of my thigh. I sank against the wall with a sigh, my eyes closed as he kissed my lips again, his tongue teasing mine. His fingers slipped under the fabric of the lacy lingerie I was wearing under my sweet dress and I groaned into his mouth at the pressure of his fingers pushing inside of me.</p><p>Adam pulled back, his breathing as shallow as mine as he toyed with me. I closed my eyes again, the pleasure tightening. I gripped his arm as he pushed me toward it. \u201cAdam,\u201d I pleaded.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d his words rumbled over my mouth and I immediately opened my eyes to find his blazing into mine. \u201cI want to watch you come.\u201d</p><p>I felt my cheeks flush even harder at the demand but I held his gaze as his fingers worked me, my hips undulating against his hand, my gaze turning drowsy. Adam\u2019s breathing grew harsher and harsher as he watched me, and when he pressed down on my clit with his thumb and I broke apart, clinging to him through my orgasm, he swore loudly and rested his head in the crook of my neck.</p><p>My legs were trembling as I came down from my high, reality settling in. Confusion overwhelmed me and I felt tears prick my eyes. Adam\u2019s warm breath caressed my skin as he lifted his head to whisper in my ear, \u201cI almost came just watching you.\u201d</p><p>I shivered, tingling all over again.</p><p>\u201cYou make me so goddamn hard,\u201d he confessed and he gently lifted my hand to press it to his erection straining against his trousers. Triumph melted the confusion away for a second, a powerful feeling of victory taking over me as I caressed him and felt his groans of pleasure against my ear. At least he wanted me. At least he was in torment over that.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t stop, baby,\u201d he peeled my hand away with a regretful sigh, \u201cI\u2019m going to blow.\u201d</p><p>When he lifted his head our eyes met and he saw the tears shining in mine and pushed away from me with another curse. Running his hand through his hair, Adam sighed heavily, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that. Els, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d His face crumpled and I saw the self-flagellation in his expression.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked softly, needing to know once and for all what was happening to us. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t you have done it? Why can\u2019t we be together?\u201d</p><p>Those gorgeous dark eyes of his lifted to mine in surprise, as if he couldn\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t understand. \u201cBecause of Braden, Els. He\u2019s my best friend. He\u2019s family. I can\u2019t take the risk that he won\u2019t forgive me for...\u201d he gestured helplessly to me.</p><p>The warmth from the aftermath of the orgasm he\u2019d given me was destroyed by the chill his words created in me. I stood up from the wall and tried to control that burning lump in my throat. \u201cBut I\u2019m willing to. I\u2019m willing to because I\u2019m in love with you. You know I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>The lack of surprise on his face was confirmation.</p><p>I shook my head, laughing bitterly as I wiped at tears that had begun to fall. \u201cAll these years, even now, you\u2019ve told me all you ever wanted to do was protect me from getting hurt.</p><p>And yet you say things and do things to confuse me, to make me think you might feel the same way that I feel about you, and then in the next second you\u2019re cold and you flaunt other women in front of me.\u201d The tears fell fast now and I could see Adam\u2019s own eyes starting to shimmer with pain. I didn\u2019t care. I had to get this over with. \u201cThe only person who\u2019s ever really hurt me is you. And I keep letting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d he sounded in pain as he took a step toward me. He stopped though, the pain transferring to his eyes when I moved away from him. \u201cI do love you,\u201d he admitted and instead of feeling joy at those words, the last piece of me holding onto hope crumbled.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cBut not enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true. Els, you of all people have to understand. If you and me start something and it all goes south, I lose Braden too. I\u2019ll lose the two people in the world who mean anything to me.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to understand him. I tried to understand the reasons behind people\u2019s actions because I wanted to believe the best in everyone. But all I knew was that I loved him enough to risk it all\u2014to risk our history\u2014 for something more, and the fact that he wasn\u2019t willing told me he couldn\u2019t possibly feel the way I felt about him. I didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with someone I loved more than he\u2019d ever love me.</p><p>\u201cGo home, Adam,\u201d I replied softly. \u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened in shock. \u201cEllie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pretend for Braden. When we\u2019re all together, I\u2019ll pretend for Braden that nothing has changed between you and me.\u201d I held his gaze, attempting to be strong as I ended us. \u201cBut whatever this is, it\u2019s over. Everything. Don\u2019t call me, don\u2019t visit... just don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want you near me when you don\u2019t have to be. It hurts too much, and if you care about me even just a little bit, you\u2019ll stay away from me.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t let him reply. I couldn\u2019t. I turned and strode down the hall and into my room, closing the door behind me and leaning against it while I tried to catch my breath.</p><p>There was silence in the hallway for what seemed like forever, and then finally I heard the front door open and close quietly.</p><p>The burn in my throat burst out into sobs, and I slid down the door panting for breath through the pain...</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>\u201cMost miserable bloody weeks of my life after that.\u201d Adam turned the pages, scanning my sparse entries after that night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I slid my hand around the nape of his neck and gave it a squeeze. \u201cMe too, honey.\u201d</p><p>He lifted my hand from his neck and brought it around to give my knuckles an absentminded kiss. \u201cThe night at Jenna and Ed\u2019s wedding was fucking torture.\u201d</p><p>Agreed. We\u2019d both taken dates. I\u2019d taken Nicholas just to be particularly annoying and Adam had taken some random girl with him. Although I\u2019d flitted around the wedding acting my cheery self and steadfastly refusing to look Adam\u2019s way, it was one of the most painful experiences of my life.</p> <p>Adam threaded my fingers through his and rested our hands on his lap. \u201cHere it is.\u201d He held the diary up.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I frowned, trying to read my writing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fast forwarding to my wake up call.\u201d</p><p>Monday, December 17th I\u2019m writing this as quickly as I can because I can see Adam is about to rip the pen from my hand and use whatever means at his disposal to bring my attention back to him. Since I like the means he will use I need to get this down. It\u2019s been an utterly exhausting weekend but today I woke up feeling stronger than I have in a while. This morning I woke up to something beautiful, and I swear after the last week I\u2019ve had, I didn\u2019t think that was possible... Focusing on a crack in my ceiling I determinedly attempted to push the fear and desperation back. There was this buried part of me that kept trying to push up and grip my chest from the inside out to pull me to it to whisper desolately, \u201cI\u2019m not ready to die.\u201d</p><p>Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop... I couldn\u2019t think like that.</p> <p>But it was what I\u2019d been hiding from for months. When my doctor told me I needed glasses I\u2019d ignored my own instincts and grabbed onto that solution with utter relief.</p><p>Still, the headaches kept coming, the exhaustion worsened as the anxiety I kept hidden from everyone built and built.</p><p>Ten days ago I\u2019d had a seizure in my kitchen. I was terrified but also strangely relieved as I sat in the hospital and waited for my turn on the MRI\u2014sick to my stomach with fear but relieved that I was going to know once and for all what the hell was wrong with me.</p><p>A tumor, though. A brain tumor.</p><p>I tried to catch my breath. We\u2019d waited ten days for the results and it was a brain tumor and they wouldn\u2019t tell me anything else. I had twenty four hours of waiting to find out if I had brain cancer or not.</p><p>I wanted to handle it graciously, not just for me but for Braden and Mum and Clark and Hannah and Declan. I wanted to handle it graciously for Joss, knowing it would be difficult for her. However, her reaction... A tear slid down my cheek as I thought on her reaction only a few hours ago. I\u2019d watched the panic in her face and then she just... shut down. She just left me. When I needed her the most, she just... left me.</p> <p>Braden was furious and panicking about me and about her and trying not to. His anxiety was making me worse so I told him to go and speak to Mum and Clark. Understanding I needed just a little time to myself he gave me it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t think of the worst. I wouldn\u2019t be like Joss. I mean, I wanted to be prepared but I wasn\u2019t a pessimist. And surely, I was too young to... You never think something like this will happen to you. It feels like a dream, it\u2019s so surreal, like you\u2019re watching someone else\u2019s life play out in a movie.</p><p>My phone rang and I turned my head on my pillow to eye it on my bedside table.</p><p>Adam Calling.</p><p>I breathed through the tightness in my chest and reached for the phone. Since I landed in the hospital ten days ago, Adam had reneged on his unspoken promise to stay out of my life.</p><p>He called me every day and came by the flat as much as he felt I\u2019d let him get away with it.</p><p>Too exhausted to fight him, I did let him get away with it.</p><p>\u201cHullo,\u201d I answered and even I could tell I didn\u2019t sound like myself.</p> <p>There was a crackle down the line as he let out a heavy sigh. \u201cBraden just called.\u201d</p><p>I tensed, hearing the roughness in Adam\u2019s voice, the choked brokenness in his tone.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Ellie,\u201d he groaned as if in agony. \u201cSweetheart\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I shook my head even though he couldn\u2019t see me, and I bit my lip to try and stem the flow of tears. As soon as I felt I could speak without crying, I continued, \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I need to come to you. I\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d my voice was sharp as I sat up, my heart pounding at the thought of having him here to hold me through this. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Els.\u201d</p><p>I winced at the hurt in his voice. \u201cPlease, Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to. I need to be with you. I love you, Ellie. I\u2019m fucking in love you.\u201d</p><p>He was crying.</p><p>I\u2019d never heard or seen him cry before. At his tears and outright confession I started to cry too and collapsed back on my pillow, squeezing the phone tight to my ear. Finally I whispered, \u201cJust stay on the line with me, okay.\u201d</p><p>Adam cleared his throat, his voice breaking as he replied, \u201cAnything, baby.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and snuggled deeper against my phone. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cIt could be nothing,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is, I\u2019m going to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fight with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh,\u201d I hushed him softly. \u201cNo promises. Not like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done wasting time, Els.\u201d</p><p>I smiled sadly, too weary to go there. \u201cJust waste a little more time for me. Please.\u201d</p><p>He was a silent a while and then he replied quietly, \u201cOnly a little, baby. Only a little.\u201d</p><p>*** Adam\u2019s phone bill would be ridiculous but I doubted he cared. He stayed on the phone with me for two hours and we hardly spoke. I just listened to him breathe as he listened to me breathe. We finally hung up when Braden returned, but Adam refused to let me say the words goodbye and it was the first time I heard undiluted fear in his voice when he begged me not to say that word.</p><p>It was a lot. It was huge. But it was one thing for him to admit to me again that he loved me and an entirely different thing for him to admit that to Braden. I needed to get through this crisis before I could deal with me and Adam.</p><p>I watched television with Braden for a while, snuggled up into his side as he stroked my hair soothingly. Mum and Clark had gotten into a huge fight with him because they wanted to come to me but Braden insisted there was nothing they could do right now and while I was stuck in limbo it would be best if I had peace and quiet and didn\u2019t have to worry about how they were coping with this. I appreciated it but I also gave them a quick call so they could hear my voice and I could ask them to take me to my appointment the next day. They were okay at first but then suddenly Clark had to say a quick goodbye when Mum started to sob.</p><p>Of course that set me off for a while, and then I calmed, and then as it got darker outside and the evening began to pass, the fear over what I\u2019d hear tomorrow hit me.</p><p>Braden laid me back on my bed and curled my hand around a mug of hot water and whiskey. He sat on my bed as I drank it and he watched me until my eyes finally fluttered closed.</p><p>They slammed open at the sound of my bedroom floor creaking. I was curled up in a ball on my bed in the dark, and through the moonlight spilling in through the large window I saw Joss standing at the bottom of my bed.</p><p>Surprised that she had come to me but still gripped by hurt at her defection earlier, I just gazed at her with round eyes.</p><p>At a breathy gasp, my eyes grew wider as I realized Joss was crying. Joss was crying.</p><p>Joss. I knew she\u2019d run earlier because of the baggage she carried around about her family\u2019s deaths. I\u2019d known that on some level that fear had sent her running from me, but actually witnessing her tears, I realized it all meant that she cared about me. She was frightened of losing me.</p><p>The tears slipped down my cheeks and moved Joss to action. She crawled up onto my bed and as she settled in beside me I turned on my back. Joss immediately rested her head on my shoulder and shifted closer to me. She took my hand and held it between both of hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I promised her and meant it. \u201cYou came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Ellie Carmichael. You\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d won the love and affection of someone as lost as Jocelyn Butler? For me that was a whole lot of light in a whole lot of dark and it overwhelmed me. I tried to swallow past an answering sob as I whispered the truth back to her, \u201cI love you too, Joss.\u201d</p><p>*** Braden had woken us up that morning and he\u2019d made us breakfast. Even with the appointment with the neurosurgeon looming over me that afternoon, I could tell something had gone horribly wrong with Joss and Braden. Upon asking them, I discovered they\u2019d broken up and attempted not to feel guilty. I failed.</p><p>They\u2019d clearly broken up because of me... because of Joss\u2019s reaction to what was happening to me. Hearing Braden\u2019s deadly cool voice with her and seeing the flinch of pain in Joss\u2019s face, I wanted to intervene, I wanted to fix what I had inadvertently helped break, but they wouldn\u2019t have it and I was ushered out of the room and into a shower.</p><p>At one point I heard their escalated voices over the spill of water and then a plate crashing followed by more shouting. Worried, I switched off the shower and clambered out but the voices had quieted to a murmur. Still, I hurried getting dried and pulled on a bathrobe, ready to put myself between them if need be.</p><p>Instead as I walked quietly down the hall I heard Braden confessing that he loved her and that he wasn\u2019t going to stop fighting for her. He promised her in his way that he would be relentless. The romantic in me almost passed out on the spot.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d Joss hissed back.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I disagreed, coming to a stop in the kitchen doorway, giving them a smile. \u201cHe\u2019s fighting for what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the only one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I turned my head in shock at the sound of the familiar voice, and watched with a pounding heart as Adam strode into the flat toward me. He looked like hell with dark circles under his bloodshot eyes, and it looked like he hadn\u2019t shaved in a couple of days.</p><p>He was still absolutely beautiful, and the way he was gazing at me, like I was something precious just dancing out of his arm\u2019s reach, was absolutely beautiful.</p><p>When he stopped before me he took my hand and raised it to his mouth, squeezing his eyes closed as he pressed a kiss against it. My breath caught as he opened his eyes and I saw the tears from yesterday were back again, shimmering in their depths. I also knew from the determined fire blazing in his eyes that he had really meant it when he said he\u2019d only waste a little more time for me. As in less than twenty four hours.</p> <p>That\u2019s why when he tugged me by the hand and drew me into the kitchen as he faced up to Braden, I let him. Because in a few hours I\u2019d discover whether or not I had the biggest fight of my life on my hands, and even after everything, the only person I wanted fighting by my side was Adam Gerard Sutherland. We had a history, and I wanted to keep adding years to that history.</p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something,\u201d Adam faced Braden and I could feel the tension vibrating from his body.</p><p>He was doing it. He was really willing to risk it for me. I squeezed his hand tighter.</p><p>Braden crossed his arms over his chest, his eyes moving from Adam to me and then back to Adam again and I knew he knew but he wasn\u2019t going to make it easy. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a brother to me. I would never do anything to hurt you. And I know I haven\u2019t been what a brother would consider good material for his wee sister, but I love Ellie, Braden.</p> <p>I have for a long time now, and I can\u2019t not be with her. I\u2019ve wasted too much time as it is.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think either of us took a breath as we waited for Braden\u2019s response. After a minute\u2019s contemplation he finally turned to me, his gaze softening. \u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>Adam looked back at me and I was surprised to find a glint of insecurity in his eyes. Silly man. I gripped his arm tighter to reassure him and then smiled at my brother. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>And then quite casually, as if Adam and I weren\u2019t tied up in knots over his possible reaction, Braden just shrugged and leaned over to switch on the kettle. \u201cAbout bloody time.</p><p>You two were giving me a headache.\u201d</p><p>My muscles tensed in reaction. All this time he\u2019d known? Adam and I had put ourselves through pain and heartbreak these last few months and Braden had known all along how we felt about one another.</p> <p>\u201cYou really are a know-it-all pain in the ass,\u201d Joss said for us all. She pushed past him in annoyance and stopped to say more softly, \u201cI\u2019m happy for you,\u201d to me and Adam before she flounced down the hall to the bathroom.</p><p>Braden laughed softly. \u201cShe loves me really.\u201d</p><p>The bathroom door slammed at that and Braden laughed again. Adam narrowed his eyes on him. \u201cI hope she puts you through hell, you cocky bastard.\u201d</p><p>Braden smirked and shifted his gaze to me. \u201cI had to make sure you were willing to fight for her. She\u2019s worth the fight.\u201d</p><p>Adam sighed and put his arm around my shoulder, drawing me into his side so he could kiss the top of my head. \u201cI know that better than anyone.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and inhaled him, thanking whatever divine being out there that had added another blast of light into my darkness.</p><p>*** For a moment I just lay there, my smile pressed into my pillow. Not only had I awoken to the heat of Adam curled into my back, his forehead pressed against my nape in sleep, his heavy arm draped across my waist and his right leg caught in between mine, but I\u2019d awoken to the lightness of remembered relief. I\u2019d awoken feeling stronger than I had done in what had felt like a very long time.</p><p>Yesterday, although I knew from the look on his face he wanted to come with me, Adam had, along with Braden, Joss, Hannah and Dec, quietly remained at my flat while Mum and Clark accompanied me to my appointment with the neurosurgeon. Dr. Dunham was a pleasant man in his early forties who shunted the fear of God out of me and my parents with five words, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d He assured us that the cause of the physical symptoms was actually a large cist attached to two very small tumors, and the cist was causing pressure. He told us it had to be removed and because of its placement\u2014on the surface of my brain\u2014there was very little risk to the surgery. Like two percent risk. He\u2019d also told us that there was little chance of the tumors proving to be cancerous but that they\u2019d be sent off for biopsy to make sure. He\u2019d scheduled me in for surgery in two weeks\u2019 time, and although now that I had time to think about it I was scared as all hell about going under the knife, the relief of knowing that there was a massive chance I was fighting a small fight and not one for my life was overwhelming and draining.</p> <p>When I\u2019d returned home to give everyone the optimistic news, Adam had surprised me by kissing me right there in front of my parents. I was even more surprised to discover they weren\u2019t the least bit surprised. Afterward we\u2019d all gone next door to the pub to gather our thoughts and try to unwind from what had been the most horrendous twenty fours I\u2019d ever remembered experiencing. I sat in the pub with Adam on one side and Hannah curled into me on the other, and, despite everything, I felt incredibly lucky as I gazed around at my friends and family.</p><p>Mum and Clark eventually took Hannah and Dec home, Braden reluctantly left to give Joss some space and Joss disappeared into her room to give me and Adam some space. We ordered take away, which I ravenously ate since I hadn\u2019t eaten anything for what felt like forever, and hung out on my bed. We talked for a little while, but there was so much to talk about it and I was too exhausted to give us the focus we needed. It seemed Adam was too because he disappeared with our leftovers and returned only to cuddle up to me in the bed and reach out to switch off the light.</p><p>Now I was awake with soft morning sun pouring in through my curtains, I was feeling strong and ready to take on anything, and Adam Sutherland was spooning me.</p><p>It was kind of beautiful.</p><p>I felt his hair tickle my neck as he moved and his arm tightened across my waist. \u201cYou awake, baby?\u201d he murmured, sleep making his voice extra sexy.</p><p>My grin got bigger. \u201cYeah.\u201d I lightly caressed his forearm. \u201cYou know in all the years I\u2019ve known you I\u2019ve never slept near you. You make noises.\u201d</p><p>I felt his chest move behind me in laughter. \u201cNoises?\u201d</p><p>Twisting now, so I could look into his eyes, I grinned up into his face as he leaned over me. \u201cYou make \u2018mmm\u2019 noises.\u201d</p><p>Adam grinned back at me. \u201cWhat are \u2018mmm\u2019 noises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know \u2018mmm\u2019 noises. \u2018Mmm\u2019... when something tastes or sounds good.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cLike \u2018yum\u2019 noises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly but you know, \u2018mmm\u2019...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I just took a hit to my masculinity.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing and turned around so we were face to face, my hands reaching up to stroke his jaw. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I liked it. I just imagined the \u2018mmm\u2019s\u2019 were for me.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping his arms tighter around me and pulling my leg over his hip so we were crushed together, Adam\u2019s eyes grew drowsy and heated as he stared at my mouth. \u201cThey were for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could they be for me if you didn\u2019t even know you make them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I dream about you,\u201d he answered instantly and I stilled in surprise. He felt it and gave me a squeeze. \u201cI\u2019ve been having these dreams about you for a few years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing in them?\u201d I asked somewhat breathlessly. There was a rising tide of warmth in my chest, and an even hotter heat tingling between my legs at his confession.</p><p>His hand slid down my waist to caress my bum and then he pulled my lower body against his and I could feel his morning erection pressing against me. I felt my nipples tighten in reaction, and drew in a shuddery breath. \u201cSometimes we\u2019re making love, other times we\u2019re fucking.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my eyes to his, my smile dimming. \u201cI don\u2019t like that word.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched. \u201cYou think it\u2019s unromantic.\u201d</p><p>He knew me too well. I shrugged unsurely.</p><p>\u201cEls, wanting to fuck you doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>Needing more clarification, I slid my hands down from his face and settled them lightly on his chest. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>His voice was hoarse now, \u201cWhen I want to fuck you it means I\u2019m in the mood for rough and hard.\u201d</p><p>To my utter shock his words were turning me on. I squirmed a little against him and felt my cheeks flush. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been...\u201d I still wasn\u2019t sure if I could say the word.</p><p>I\u2019d admonished Joss so many times for using it because it was so tawdry sounding but when Adam put it like that... \u201cSay it,\u201d he whispered across my mouth. \u201cI want to hear it from your sweet mouth, baby.\u201d</p><p>I gulped and bravely met his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve... I\u2019ve never been fucked,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>If it was possible he grew even harder against me and when his hand slipped between our bodies and under my pants, his fingers thrusting gently but easily into me, Adam groaned.</p><p>\u201cBaby...\u201d he leaned into me, his mouth brushing mine, his tongue just touching the tip of mine. \u201cI think you like the thought of me fucking you.\u201d</p><p>In response I kissed him. It was a deep kiss, one I meant to encourage the whole \u201cf-word\u201d</p><p>thing but instead it turned soulful and desperate.</p><p>Adam rolled me onto my back, pressing my legs apart so he could settle between them, and when he broke our kiss it was to look into my eyes with such adoration I couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cI\u2019m not going to fuck you this morning, baby. This morning I\u2019m going to make love to you. We\u2019ll leave the rest until you\u2019re recovered and at full strength.\u201d His eyes darkened with promise. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grinned up at him, suddenly realizing that Adam was here, in my arms, talking about our future together. It was a thirteen year old dream come true. \u201cYou have no idea how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly, pushing my dress up my body. \u201cAs much as I love you.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time he\u2019d said it at a time I could allow myself to feel it. Those three words poured out of him and pooled into my chest and as I raised my dress over my head, lying almost naked for his perusal I smiled shyly up at him. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t mind what we do this morning. You can do whatever you want to me.\u201d</p> <p>To my surprise this caused Adam to groan and he dropped his head on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBaby?\u201d</p><p>He turned his cheek and pressed a kiss to my bare skin, his hands coasting up my ribs to cup my breasts. I arched into his touch with a sigh as he replied, \u201cHow did I get so lucky? Smart, funny, sweet, beautiful, passionate and she tells me I can do anything I want to her.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled now. \u201cThere has to be a catch.\u201d I blushed deeply and Adam raised his head to witness it, laughing. \u201cFuck, I forgot modest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d I pushed playfully at his shoulders but really I needed him to stop or I was going to start crying.</p> <p>He laughed again, the rumbling against my chest doing happy things to me down south.</p><p>Giving my shoulder another quick kiss, Adam sat up, straddling me as he pulled off his t- shirt. I drank my fill, biting my lip as my eyes took him in. I\u2019d forgotten how beautiful he was\u2014broad shoulders and lean muscles. Abs to die for.</p><p>His eyes never left me as his hands went to the buckle on his belt. I shivered with anticipation as he undid it and drew his jean\u2019s zip down. \u201cThis morning I\u2019m making love to you because our first time should be about that. Plus, no matter how great you\u2019re feeling, and I can tell you\u2019re feeling a lot better, your body must still be exhausted. We\u2019re taking it nice and slow.\u201d He pushed down his jeans and underwear and my breathing stuttered as his erection sprang free, jutting up and out, hard and throbbing. Now I knew why the bugger was so confident. He was walking around with that in his trousers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making \u2018mmm\u2019 noises,\u201d Adam told me with laughter in his voice as he turned to shimmy his jeans clean off.</p><p>\u201cI am not!\u201d I protested, blushing again, and realizing I\u2019d been so lost in staring at him that there was a great possibility I had been making \u2018mmm\u2019 noises.</p><p>\u201cYou were. It\u2019s fucking adorable.\u201d He turned back to me only to reach for my underwear.</p> <p>I tilted my hips to help him ease them down my legs, and as he did he stopped every now and then to kiss my bare skin. When the underwear was off, he pushed my left knee up and I watched him with growing heat coiling in the pit of my stomach as he trailed kisses up my calf, across my knee, and along my inner thigh. \u201cYour legs go on forever,\u201d he whispered, his eyes lifting to meet mine. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to have them wrapped around me while I\u2019m inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d I breathed completely at his mercy.</p><p>I repeated his name on an even breathier breath when his head descended between my legs and his tongue licked gently at my clit. He worked me with his mouth, kissing and licking and sucking until I came fast and hard against him.</p><p>I was still crying out to God as Adam kissed his way up my stomach and then stopped to draw my nipple into his hot mouth. He played with me a while, all the time murmuring compliments and love words, until eventually I was wound so tight I begged him to come inside me.</p><p>At the pressure of him between my legs I tensed and feeling it Adam threaded his fingers through mine and held my hands down on the bed while he stared into my eyes, anchoring me to him in every way he could. His lips parted on exhalation as he pushed inside me and sank deep. I gasped and lifted my hips in instinct causing a delicious frisson of pleasure through us both. Adam\u2019s eyes grew lidded as he studied me, his expression tender. \u201cI love you, Ellie Carmichael,\u201d he whispered, his words heavy with sincerity.</p><p>I nodded and moved my hips again, panting slightly as I replied, \u201cI love you, Adam.\u201d</p><p>His grip on my hands became almost painful and he slid out of me nearly entirely before gliding back inside. I undulated against him, and we caught a wave, a slow rhythm that built and built until I was desperate for the finale. My legs were wrapped around him now, my thighs squeezing him tighter, begging for more.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d I cried out, pushing against his hands, wanting to touch him, wanting to grasp him against me. \u201cHarder, please.\u201d</p> <p>He growled low in his throat and he pulled out only to slam back into me. I started murmuring nonsense, mostly saying the word \u201cyes\u201d over and over again as he continued to slam into me.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, Els,\u201d he demanded, his eyes on my face. \u201cCome for me, baby.\u201d</p><p>And like I\u2019d been prone to doing for years, I gave him what he wanted. The rhythm hit its crescendo and I broke apart on a scream as Adam pressed his cheek to mine and tensed. I floated up around in post-orgasmic space and he shuddered hard against me as he came.</p><p>We were both panting heavily, both clammy with sweat, and I imagined we were both a little jellified. I grinned at the ceiling. That was what happened when you had the most amazing sex of your life. \u201cWow,\u201d I whispered, sliding my arms around his back now that he\u2019d let my hands go.</p><p>Adam lifted his cheek from mine, his features relaxed with satisfaction. His dark eyes, however, were glittering intensely. \u201cWow doesn\u2019t even cover it,\u201d he replied. \u201cBeen waiting my whole life for that.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip because that was so nice I wanted to cry.</p><p>Sensing that, he smiled and gave me a soft kiss. When he pulled back he frowned. \u201cThat was a bit of both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I frowned back at him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI started out making love to you but it\u2019s your fault I ended up fucking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d his voice went amusingly breathy as he imitated me, \u201cHarder, please.\u201d He shook his head as I laughed. \u201cI\u2019m a man of great self-control but that...\u201d</p><p>I squeezed my thighs around him again in delight. \u201cAre you admitting I have power over you, Adam Gerard Sutherland?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows puckered together as he shook his head in denial, a shake that quickly turned to a nod as I giggled beneath him. He closed his eyes in what appeared to be pleasured pain and suddenly he captured me around the waist and flipped us so he was on his back and I was lying on top of him. He held me close and I relaxed against him, understanding dawning. He just needed to hold me for a moment and remember I was okay.</p><p>Once again I was overwhelmed by the realization that he was in love with me. I smiled against his skin and snuggled closer.</p><p>After a while he murmured, \u201cYou\u2019re on the pill, right?\u201d</p><p>I snorted at the unexpected question and lifted my head with a raised eyebrow. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you have asked that before you took me oh so wildly?\u201d</p><p>He grinned up at me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really thinking about anything but the need to take you oh so wildly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not to worry. I\u2019m on the pill,\u201d I assured him and settled back on his chest.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway,\u201d he murmured, stroking my hair.</p><p>I tensed. \u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning if an accident happened it wouldn\u2019t matter. An accident with you is a kid with you.\u201d</p><p>Shock held me completely frozen as I processed this. How many times had I heard Braden joking with Adam about how terrified he was of getting a girl pregnant? It was one of the reasons Braden suspected Adam never slept with the same girl twice. In his twisted male logic he thought it meant it lessened the chance of an accident, or at least it lessened the chance of a girl liking him so much she\u2019d force an accident.</p><p>\u201cYou want a baby with me?\u201d My throat croaked on the question.</p><p>I felt his knuckles brush down my spine in a caress that made me shiver to the tips of my toes. \u201cEllie, I want everything with you.\u201d</p><p>Tears glimmering in my eyes I lifted my head and replied softly, gratefully, \u201cI never knew you could be so romantic.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s lips twitched in response and he shook his head against the pillow. \u201cI\u2019m not, but I reckon I\u2019d do anything for you and since that has included sitting through more romantic comedies any man should have to endure, I know you\u2019re a romantic... and I just want you happy. I\u2019ve got a lot to make up for.\u201d He brushed my hair back from my face. \u201cAnd you make it easy.\u201d He pulled lightly on a strand of hair, his expression suddenly serious. \u201cBut if you breathe one word of it to your brother, or anybody for that matter, there will be consequences.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and shook my head. \u201cI won\u2019t tell, I promise. I like knowing something about you no one else does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He flipped me again and I squealed with laughter as he wrestled me back on the bed. Once he had me captured with my legs wrapped around his waist, he kissed me and drew back to murmur, \u201cI\u2019m the only one who knows sweet \u2018butter wouldn\u2019t melt in her mouth\u2019 Ellie Carmichael likes it when I talk dirty.\u201d</p><p>Once again I felt my skin flush with embarrassment but I didn\u2019t contradict him. I couldn\u2019t because he was so damn right.</p><p>Last First Chapter \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve decided you can\u2019t give these to Joss.\u201d Adam slammed the diary closed. \u201cIn fact, you may have to burn them.\u201d</p><p>I took it off of him and added it to the pile. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you go into a lot of detail, Els. Not just about sex but also about what I say to you before, during, and after sex.\u201d</p><p>I tried not to laugh and failed miserably. \u201cYou mean the romantic stuff?\u201d</p><p>He gave me an unimpressed look. \u201cYou are not giving that to Joss. She\u2019ll tell Braden and I\u2019ll never hear the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Joss tries to be considerate since Braden\u2019s my brother but sometimes things slip and what slips is that he can be a romantic too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adam\u2019s eyebrows rose and I saw his mouth start to curl mischievously at the corners.</p><p>\u201cRomantic how?\u201d</p><p>I grunted at him. \u201cAs if I\u2019m going to tell you and give you ammunition to torture him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only fair if you\u2019re going to give him ammunition to torture me.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling at his fear that my brother would discover Adam\u2019s softer side, I shook my head slowly and answered casually. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided not to give Joss the diaries.\u201d</p><p>Cocking his head in confusion Adam\u2019s eyes asked the question for him.</p> <p>I shrugged. \u201cI was going to up until that last entry. Reading it all just reminded me how much we felt, how much we feel, and how much a part of us it is. It doesn\u2019t belong to anyone else and I guess I don\u2019t want it to. It\u2019s ours. Our history. Our story. And in a way our future too. As much as I love her, you\u2019re right. I can\u2019t give that to Joss. I can\u2019t give these to her. \u201d I gestured to the diaries and then got up on all fours over the scattered mess in a move to put them away. I was abruptly stopped by the pressure of Adam\u2019s hands on either side of my hips.</p><p>I looked back over my shoulder, my eyes widening slightly at the sight of him on his knees behind me with the most carnal and possessive look on his face. My lips parted as he pulled my arse into him and I felt his erection rub against me. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked on a whisper.</p><p>In response he slipped his hand around to the zipper on my shorts and tugged it down as his other hand tugged the zipper down on his jeans. \u201cIn a little while we\u2019ll go upstairs to make love, but right now I\u2019m going to fuck my future wife on top of our history.\u201d</p><p>Somehow Adam managed to get the \u201cf-word\u201d into the most romantic sentence ever, and I didn\u2019t care. Instead I gasped as he rocked against me and hoarsely replied, \u201cWhat about the floor? We might scratch it.\u201d</p><p>He stroked his hands up my spine and brought them back down to grip my hips and he hauled me harder against him. \u201cDo you really think I give a shit about the floor right now?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, already flushing with anticipation. \u201cI\u2019m guessing not.\u201d</p> <p>Adam grinned wickedly. \u201cLet\u2019s start the next chapter, baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
