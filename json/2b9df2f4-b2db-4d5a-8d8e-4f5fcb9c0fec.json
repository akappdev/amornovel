Nothing had been all right since my sister vanished into thin air.</p><p>I\u2019d never known people could disappear so completely that no trace was ever found. Isn\u2019t this America?</p> <p>Land of the free, home of the security camera? Big Brother is watching more often than we think.</p><p>Unfortunately, he\u2019d been asleep at the switch when Katie went AWOL.</p><p>For three years there hadn\u2019t been a sign of her despite all the pictures I\u2019d plastered on signposts, store windows, and every missing persons Internet site I could find.</p><p>Then I\u2019d gone into the office, started sorting through my stack of mail, opened a five-by-seven manila envelope, and voil\u00e0! There she was, standing outside a building named Rising Moon.</p><p>It had taken me all of three minutes to determine the place was a j azz club in New Orleans. I\u2019d shoved a few changes of clothes and my toothbrush into a backpack and boarded the next available flight.</p> <p>A few hours later, I stood on a street called Frenchmen, listening to j azz wail out an open doorway and wondering how it could be so freaking hot in the middle of February. When I\u2019d gotten on the plane in Philly, fat snowflakes had been tumbling down.</p><p>I\u2019d never visited New Orleans, never wanted to. I wasn\u2019t the party type; I wouldn\u2019t fit in. However, I didn\u2019t plan to stay. I planned to get Katie and get gone.</p><p>I forced myself to walk through the door, ignoring the smoke, the noise, the people. The inside was sparse, narrow, nothing like the big, airy taverns at home, which boasted lots of tables, lots of space for billiards, darts, and other amusements. Rising Moon was all about the music.</p><p>I knew nothing about j azz. Give me some Aerosmith, a little Guns n\u2019 Roses, even Ozzie on a really tough day. But j azz? I\u2019d never understood the attraction.</p><p>One look at the man playing the saxophone near the front of the room and attraction took on a different twist.</p><p>He was tall and slim, and everything about him\u2014his hair, his clothes, even the glasses that covered his eyes\u2014was dark.</p> <p>I glanced at the ceiling. Not a spotlight to be had.</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d I muttered, and received a few glares from the spectators crowded as close to the man as they could get.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t any stage. He just stood in a corner and played. From the microphone, the piano, and the abandoned drum set behind him, I assumed the corner was the stage.</p><p>He held that sax as if it were the only thing he\u2019d ever loved. Despite the need to show the picture of Katie to anything that moved, I found myself watching, listening, captivated by a stranger and his music.</p><p>Even with the dark sunglasses bisecting his face, I could tell he was better than handsome. His hair was shorn close, but that only drew attention to the sharpness of his cheekbones and the devilishly well-trimmed mustache and goatee.</p><p>His hands were long fingered and elegant, the hands of an aristocrat in a world where such distinctions were long dead. He seemed European, and I guess that wasn\u2019t too odd, considering.</p><p>New Orleans had always been more foreign than domestic\u2014a city where life moved at a slower pace, where music and dancing were part of every day and every night, where French was as commonly murmured as curse words. No wonder I\u2019d felt itchy and out of sorts from the moment I\u2019d stepped off the plane. I was a peasant, and I always would be.</p><p>The tune ended, whatever it was, the last notes drifting toward the high ceiling and fading away. The spell over the crowd broke as they clapped, chattered among themselves, then lifted their glasses to drink.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d His voice was as mesmerizing as his hands\u2014deep, melodious, with an accent I couldn\u2019t place. Perhaps Spanish, with a pinch of the South, a dash of the North, and something mysterious just beneath.</p><p>The bartender, a tall, muscular black man with eerily light brown eyes and impossibly short natural hair appeared at my elbow. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to shake my head to clear it of the dopey infatuation with the sax player\u2019s hands and voice. I was not the type of woman who went gaga over a guy for any reason, let alone his looks. If I cared about looks I\u2019d be in deep shit. My face certainly wouldn\u2019t inspire any sonnets.</p><p>I laid the photo of Katie atop the polished wood. \u201cSeen her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou a cop?\u201d The bartender\u2019s accent was pure Dixie.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I could have shown him my private investigator\u2019s license, but I\u2019d discovered more info was forthcoming when I made my reasons personal. \u201cShe\u2019s my sister. She was eighteen when she went missing. Three years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d His face went from suspicious to sympathetic in an instant. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t determine his age\u2014maybe thirty, maybe fifty. He seemed both a part of this place and yet removed from it. Muscles bulged beneath his dark T-shirt, and the hand that reached for the snapshot would have made two of my own.</p><p>He peered at the picture so long, I wondered if his tiger-eyes were in need of some pretty thick glasses.</p><p>Then he set it back on the bar and lifted his gaze. \u201cA lot of people go missing in this city. Always have.</p><p>What with the tourists, Bourbon Street, Mardi Gras, the river, the swamp, the lake\u2014\u201d He spread his big hands and shrugged.</p><p>I\u2019d have to take his word for it. I hadn\u2019t done much research on the city proper before I\u2019d hopped on the plane. I\u2019d spent what time I had trying to figure out where the manila envelope had come from, although I\u2019d had no luck.</p><p>My address had been typed in both the center and the top left-hand corner. There\u2019d been a stamp, but no postmark. Which made me think someone had shoved it into my mailbox when I wasn\u2019t looking.</p><p>But why?</p><p>\u201cMy sister went missing from home,\u201d I clarified. \u201cFrom Philadelphia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s my sister.\u201d</p><p>Sisters can be both the best and the worst\u2014depending on the day, the mood, the sister. Mine was no different. Still, I\u2019d travel to the ends of the earth twice over for Katie. Sure, we\u2019d fought, but we\u2019d also been best friends. I\u2019d shared so many things with Katie, that without her I felt like only half of myself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recognize her.\u201d The bartender leaned back, nodding at someone who waved for a drink.</p><p>\u201cAre you the owner?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am. That would be John Rodolfo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where could I find him?\u201d</p><p>He j erked his chin toward the rear of the tavern. \u201cShould be in the office.\u201d</p><p>As I headed in that direction, the murmur of voices and the clink of glasses filled the burgeoning night.</p><p>The corner of the room was empty; the hot saxophone player was gone.</p><p>I was surprised at my disappointment. I didn\u2019t have time to hang around and listen to music I wasn\u2019t all that fond of. Hell, I didn\u2019t have time to listen to music I liked.</p><p>My life was my work and I didn\u2019t mind. I can\u2019t say what I would have done if I hadn\u2019t become a private investigator. Back when I was twenty, two years into college and no clue on a maj or, it had seemed like a good idea to take a little time off and work for Matt Hawkins, the PI my parents had hired to look for Katie. He was old, he needed help, and it was my fault she was missing anyway.</p><p>Well, not technically my fault. We\u2019d had a stupid sister fight, and she\u2019d walked out. I should have gone after her; at the very least, I should have met her later that night as I\u2019d promised. But I\u2019d been angry; I\u2019d stood her up, and I hadn\u2019t seen her since.</p><p>I never had gone back to college. Matt had left me his business when he\u2019d retired the previous year. He helped out here and there\u2014like now, for instance, when I had to leave town to follow a lead. I was conveniently between cases, and Matt could deal with anything that might come in during the few days I was gone.</p><p>A door marked private stood between two others marked MESSIEURS and MESDEMOISELLES. So where did the \u201cMesdames\u201d pee?</p><p>Most people would hesitate before barreling through a door labeled \u201cprivate\u201d but not me. I\u2019d never been very polite even before I\u2019d applied for my license to pry, so I turned the knob and stepped inside.</p><p>The room was pitch-black. I guessed Rodolfo wasn\u2019t home. I started to leave, but a single muttered curse from the depths of the darkness had me fumbling for a switch.</p><p>The harsh electric glare left me blinking. Not so the man behind the desk. He still wore his sunglasses.</p><p>For a minute my mind floundered, wondering why he was in a dark room, wearing dark glasses. Then the truth hit me in a flash brighter than the fluorescent lights.</p><p>He was blind.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you read?\u201d The man came around the desk, his long supple fingers trailing the edge, showing him the way. \u201d \u2018Private\u2019 means just that. The facilities are on either side of this door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014uh\u2014sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Get out.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows lifted at the rude words spoken in that sexy growl of a voice. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for the bathroom. I was looking for\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stopped. Was I looking for him? I wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cA quick fuck with the sax man. Not today, chica, I have a headache.\u201d</p><p>He crossed the short distance separating us more quickly than a man who couldn\u2019t see should. He also grabbed my arm with a minimum of bumbling and yanked me toward the door.</p><p>I stood my ground. I was at least four inches shorter than his six feet, and he probably outweighed me by thirty pounds, but I was in shape and determined. He couldn\u2019t budge me if I didn\u2019t want him to.</p><p>\u201cJohn Rodolfo?\u201d I asked, and he stopped tugging.</p><p>Staring at a point just to the left of my face, he demanded, \u201cWho the hell wants to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne Lockheart.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, and I was struck anew by his beauty. Even with his eyes covered so I could discern neither their shape nor their color, he was handsome beyond imagining.</p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He dropped my arm, but he didn\u2019t step back. \u201cLet\u2019s try this again. What do you want if not a quickie on the desk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer my quickies against the wall, but not today and not with you.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. I wondered what he\u2019d look like if he smiled, then shoved the notion aside. I doubted the expression ever crossed his face, and wasn\u2019t that sad?</p><p>Come to think of it, sad was how he\u2019d seemed in the flare of the overhead lights in that instant before he\u2019d sprung to his feet and come after me.</p><p>\u201cYou prefer women.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI could change your mind.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. A typical macho answer\u2014as if one night with him could change anyone\u2019s sexual preferences.</p><p>\u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but I don\u2019t prefer women. What I prefer is to get down to business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>I still clutched the photograph, but since it would do me no good with Rodolfo, I shoved it into the pocket of my j eans. \u201cI\u2019m searching for my missing sister.\u201d</p><p>Any trace of amusement vanished. \u201cWhat does that have to do with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone sent me a photograph of her standing outside this j azz club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you wanted to ask if I\u2019d seen her.\u201d He spread his hands. \u201cCan\u2019t help you. Haven\u2019t seen anyone in quite a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name was\u2014 is Katie. Katie Lockheart.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d made that slip before, talking about Katie as if she were dead. It was hard not to after three years.</p><p>I\u2019d worked enough missing persons cases to know that not finding someone in the first thirty-six hours indicated, more often than not, that they wouldn\u2019t be found alive. I patted my pocket, praying the photograph meant the statistics were wrong in Katie\u2019s case.</p><p>\u201cNever heard of her,\u201d Rodolfo said.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He stood so close his breath stirred my hair. Even though the door was open, the lights were on, I felt crowded, lost, and a little bit trapped.</p><p>I inched back. \u201cI spoke with the bartender, and I\u2019d like to speak with your other employees\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo other employees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t been open that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>If Rising Moon was new, that would date the photo, give me a better idea of when Katie might have been here.</p><p>\u201cLess than a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the place called before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing. I haven\u2019t done much except clean and stock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe outside hasn\u2019t changed? You didn\u2019t buy a new sign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The excitement rushed out of me like air from a punctured balloon.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a few cocktail waitresses but in the service business...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThey come and go.</p><p>We\u2019re constantly shorthanded even though I offer a room as part of the salary. A lot of cheap</p><p>apartments were washed away by Katrina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone who\u2019s worked for you still in town, maybe working somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of, but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and withdrew the snapshot from my pocket, staring at the image of my sister. Katie had always been the golden child, literally. While my hair was an indistinct shade, hers sparkled like a sunbeam at dusk. My eyes were the hue of a mud puddle, hers seemed to reflect the deepest blue sea. Her nose was straight and cute, her skin clear and white. And her body... Let\u2019s just say that when God handed out bra sizes, he\u2019d given Katie three quarters of mine.</p><p>You\u2019d think I would hate someone so perfect, and sometimes I had. But along with all that beauty, Katie was genuinely sweet and a whole lot of fun. We\u2019d played a thousand and one games of hide- and-seek as kids\u2014and Katie always won, but I didn\u2019t mind because I\u2019d loved being with her.</p><p>I\u2019d become obsessed with the search, to the exclusion of almost everything else, but she was my little sister, and I was supposed to take care of her. I hadn\u2019t done a very good j ob.</p><p>\u201cShut off the light when you leave.\u201d Rodolfo turned sharply, as if he couldn\u2019t wait to be alone.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure why, but I touched his shoulder, meaning to apologize for intruding, or maybe thank him for nothing. He spun around, his hand coming up and snatching my wrist before he yanked me against him.</p><p>I gave a little squeak of surprise, then my breath whooshed out as I slammed against his chest. I glanced into his face but all I saw was my reflection in the dark lenses that shaded his eyes. I looked pale, frightened, and somehow prettier than I knew myself to be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I managed. \u201cI startled you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to be touched,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Which explained his annoyance when he\u2019d thought I\u2019d come for sex. What it didn\u2019t explain was the bulge in his silky black trousers, which pressed against my hip, the heat, the pulse revealing that while Rodolfo might not want to be touched, his body had other ideas.</p><p>He let me go with an annoyed shove, then stalked to his desk and sat down, effectively removing his lower body from view. But I knew what I\u2019d felt.</p><p>Hot guy was attracted to me. I wasn\u2019t sure what to think about that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>In direct contrast to my girlie-girl sister, I\u2019d always been a tomboy. I\u2019d liked sports instead of dolls, preferred outdoor games to books. Men were intimidated by my aggressiveness, turned off by my dishwater hair, my crooked nose, and my less than gorgeous face and body. I wasn\u2019t fat or thin, neither short nor tall. I was okay\u2014average, plain.</p><p>I wore j eans a size too big, extra large men\u2019s dress shirts, always white so I could bleach out the stains that never failed to appear, even when I hadn\u2019t been near a single thing capable of causing them.</p><p>Not that I hadn\u2019t had boyfriends, relationships, sex. Just not lately. When Katie disappeared, I\u2019d dedicated my life to finding her. I hadn\u2019t considered it might actually take my whole life, but if it did, then it did.</p> <p>Just because I harbored a secret longing for the kind of love my parents had\u2014one that never faltered despite numerous years and the incredible hardship of losing a child\u2014didn\u2019t mean I was going to find it.</p><p>Women like me usually ended up living with cats. I didn\u2019t much like cats, but that was beside the point.</p><p>Rodolfo was so out of my league it was scary. However\u2014my gaze was drawn to his sunglasses\u2014he didn\u2019t know that.</p><p>Still, why so interested so fast? He\u2019d behaved as if he\u2019d been behind bars for several years. I made a mental note to check his background.</p><p>\u201cWell... thanks,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cFor manhandling you?\u201d</p><p>He sounded disgusted with himself. I felt kind of bad. He hadn\u2019t scared me, much. In truth, I\u2019d enj oyed the last few minutes more than a little. I wasn\u2019t the type of woman who brought out the beast in men. I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d wanted to be until today.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll live,\u201d I said dryly, and inched toward the door.</p><p>\u201cThe lights,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>My hand hovered near the wall. Why did it bother me to leave him in a darkness he couldn\u2019t see any more than he could see my face? I barely knew the man. If he chose to brood blindly in the dark, what was it to me?</p><p>I flicked the switch, shut the door, then stood in the hall, unable to walk away. The murmur of the crowd, the clink of the glasses, the warm-up squawks of a new band almost made me miss the sounds from the room marked private.</p> <p>Rodolfo was talking to himself.</p><p>I doubted he\u2019d be happy if he found me hovering out here, so I turned and took one step toward the crowded, noisy bar before I stopped.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to go through there again; I just wanted out. To my right lay the rear exit. I used it, slipping into a dark back alley strewn with garbage. Maybe the crowd would have been a better idea.</p><p>I reached for the door just as it clicked shut behind me. I tugged, but the thing was locked from the inside.</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d I wished I had a gun.</p><p>I\u2019d been certified to carry a lethal weapon in Pennsylvania\u2014I\u2019d taken a class and everything\u2014though I usually didn\u2019t bother. Searching for missing persons and sneaking around taking pictures of cheating spouses or fraudulent employees didn\u2019t call for a handgun.</p><p>I could have brought mine along, but the understandable hassle that went with transporting a firearm on a plane just wasn\u2019t worth it. Who knew I\u2019d be creeping around a scary alleyway after dark?</p><p>And it was scary\u2014chilly despite the blistering heat of the night, almost navy blue with flickers of silver from a moon too covered with clouds to discern a shape. The stench of rot lingered in the air and somewhere, not too far away, something with more feet than two skittered off.</p> <p>I might be a tomboy; I might know how to shoot a gun; I could even beat the crap out of someone who outweighed me by thirty pounds\u2014I\u2019d taken self-defense the first time a nut took a swing at me on the j ob</p><p>\u2014but I was still woman enough to hate rats. Does anyone really like them?</p><p>I forced myself to walk with a confident swagger in the direction of a single dim streetlight. There had to be a way back to Frenchmen Street where I could catch a cab to the brightly lit neon center of Bourbon.</p><p>Considering I was the antiparty girl, the notion shouldn\u2019t be so appealing.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t taken four steps when the blare of a trumpet and the beat of drums erupted from inside Rising Moon. I jumped a foot, spun toward the sound, and swore I\u2019d caught a glimpse of an animal sliding along the side of the building.</p><p>Should I run? I doubted a rat would chase me.</p><p>But if that had been a rat, it was the hugest rat ever grown in Louisiana, maybe the world. What I\u2019d seen had looked more like a dog\u2014a big one.</p><p>Except a dog shouldn\u2019t make my heart thump so hard it threatened to burst from my chest. A dog wouldn\u2019t hang in the shadows, just out of sight, but rather run out to greet me, or at least try to beg a meal. Unless there was something wrong with it. Like rabies.</p><p>Which meant running\u2014probably not a good idea.</p><p>Instead, I walked backward. Keeping my gaze fixed on the dark shadows that surrounded Rising Moon, I vowed never to leave home again without my gun.</p><p>The closer I got to the single streetlight, the darker those shadows became. The music spilled through the open windows and into the night, nearly drowning the thunderous beat of my heart. Nevertheless, I could have sworn I heard a growl simmering beneath.</p><p>I was spooked. That was all. I knew better than to walk alone in dark alleys. I\u2019d just been so desperate to get away from Rodolfo\u2019s muttering that I\u2019d taken the first out I could find. Which was foolish and impulsive\u2014two adj ectives that rarely applied to me. If Matt ever found out about this, he\u2019d smack me upside the head, and I\u2019d deserve it. Hey, if I lived to see him again, I\u2019d smack myself.</p><p>At last the streetlight glared from directly above.</p><p>A small corridor between two buildings revealed a busy Frenchmen Street beyond. I headed in.</p><p>The structures surrounding me were so tall they blocked any trace of a glow; I could see nothing but a blotch of gray ahead. I hurried toward it, even as something entered the alley behind me, its bulk causing the shadows to dance. I couldn\u2019t hold myself back anymore; I ran.</p><p>In the tight, enclosed lane, the harsh rush of my own breath echoed in staccato rhythm with the muted thud of my tennis shoes against the pavement and the clunk of my backpack slung over one shoulder.</p><p>The end of the alley loomed, seemingly farther away the closer I got. The space between my shoulder blades burned, as if a bull\u2019s-eye had suddenly appeared\u2014a place for the bullet to strike, the knife to plunge, or the wild beast to land, then fall with me to the ground.</p><p>I tried to glance around, as all stupid people do when they\u2019re chased, and my toe caught on a crease in the cement; there were a lot of them. I pitched forward; my hands shot out and smacked hard into the buildings on each side. A sliver plunged into my left palm, a ragged board scraped my right, but at least I didn\u2019t fall.</p><p>I burst into the open seconds later, sweaty, wild-eyed, and hyperventilating. Using a shaking hand to swipe my tangled, shoulder-length hair from my eyes, I lifted the other and hailed a passing cab.</p><p>If I climbed in a little too fast and nearly shut the door on my foot, the cabbie didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBourbon Street.\u201d</p><p>The moon burst from behind all the clouds, bright and eerily silver. I threw a final glance at the alley, which was now lit up like Times Square.</p><p>Nothing was there.</p><p>I forced myself to face front as the cabbie swung a U-turn, the wail of a sax that sounded more like a howl rising toward the navy blue night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cWhere can I get a room?\u201d I asked. The cabbie snorted and glanced in the rear-view mirror. \u201cMardi Gras parades are gonna start soon. There ain\u2019t a room to be had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere?\u201d My voice rose.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou can try.\u201d</p> <p>He dumped me at the corner of Bourbon and St. Peter. I walked into the nearest hotel, where I heard the same thing. I asked for a recommendation and only got laughed at. Seemed I\u2019d been more than foolish to come to New Orleans without a reservation this close to such a busy time of the year.</p><p>Wandering down Bourbon Street, I was fascinated in spite of myself. A lovely, gated restaurant, with gardens and outdoor tables, existed next to a theater that, from the appearance of their posters, didn\u2019t show Disney movies. A sports bar with a Dixieland band shared space with a shop that proudly displayed pornographic T-shirts. A gorgeous, nineteenth-century hotel--also booked to capacity--with a row of second- and third-floor terraces accessed by French doors, was positioned directly across the street from a strip j oint.</p><p>The distinctive smell reflected the nature of the place\u2014stale beer, fresh greenery, and rot.</p><p>I stopped at one of the bars, ordered a sandwich, showed Katie\u2019s picture, but no one knew her. I was never going to find her this way. I needed help.</p><p>The closest police station was on Royal Street, at the heart of the French Quarter.</p> <p>I explained my situation to the first cop who asked, showed my ID and Katie\u2019s picture. A short while later I shook the hand of Detective Conner Sullivan.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat.\u201d He indicated a chair on the opposite side of his desk.</p><p>Sullivan was NFL size\u2014probably six feet five, about two fifty\u2014with blond hair that appeared to have been styled by the Marines and brown eyes that did not j ibe with his name or match his fair coloring.</p><p>I especially liked his tie, which sported a Harlequin clown tossing heart-shaped confetti. The contrast of the shorn hair, crisp suit, and flat cop eyes with the amusing tie intrigued me more than it should.</p><p>I\u2019d spent the earlier part of the evening lusting after a slightly crazy, blind j azz musician; I didn\u2019t need to be curious about the great big, well-dressed detective. I had more important things to worry about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for my sister.\u201d I laid Katie\u2019s picture on the desk. \u201cHer name\u2019s Katie. Katherine Lockheart.\u201d</p> <p>His large hands enveloped the snapshot. He stared at the photo for at least thirty seconds, and I started to think he might recognize her, then he slowly shook his head. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen her, and I don\u2019t recognize the name.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, swallowed my fear, and plunged ahead. \u201cAny Jane Does?\u201d</p><p>His gaze flicked from Katie to me. \u201cAlways. But none that match this.\u201d He returned the picture. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to check the hospitals.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I knew the drill.</p><p>\u201cAre you in missing persons?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHomicide.\u201d At my confused expression he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of people go missing around here. Quite a few of them turned up dead. An equal amount haven\u2019t turned up at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you say a lot...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDozens.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes widened. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t been on CNN?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cThough the dozens have been over a period of several years, lately the tally\u2019s increased to a disturbing level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow disturbing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble the usual amount of missing and dead in the past six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thinking serial killer?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t cross your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrisscrossed several times and settled in for a nice long stay. I just didn\u2019t figure anyone else would agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, the multiple methods of death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMultiple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His disappointed sigh said it all.</p><p>Serial killers followed a pattern, almost anally so.</p><p>They found a way to do the deed that worked for them, and they stuck to it.</p><p>\u201cSome died by strangulation, others had knife wounds, a few gunshots. We\u2019ve even had several deaths by animal attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich wouldn\u2019t be attributed to a serial killer.\u201d</p><p>He grunted as if he were unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cDid you call the FBI?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Two bright spots of color flared beneath his cheekbones. His Irish skin probably fried like bacon beneath the Louisiana sun.</p><p>\u201cThey sent an Agent Franklin. He went over the cases and decided we couldn\u2019t possibly have a serial killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the methods of death were so dissimilar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and the victims were nothing alike\u2014women, men, young, old.\u201d</p><p>Serial killers were also a bit anal about whom they killed, sticking to short, sassy blondes or big- boned redheads, basically anyone who reminded them of Mommy.</p><p>\u201cMy boss wasn\u2019t happy that I brought in the Feds on a case that was so obviously not Federal.\u201d</p><p>Bosses were funny that way. I was glad all over again that I didn\u2019t have one. I\u2019d never played very well with others\u2014except for Katie and sometimes not even her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be treating the murders as connected. But\u2014\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a hunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got something,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that we\u2019ve suddenly had a rash of killings from a dozen different people, or that another dozen have suddenly disappeared without a trace. That\u2019s just too much of a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>People disappearing without a trace\u2014that was right up my alley. I had to admit I was intrigued.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather believe that one person has killed them all,\u201d I said, \u201cin defiance of every truth we know about how mass murderers behave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be tidier.\u201d</p><p>My eyes drifted over his blue suit, pristine white shirt, and neatly knotted tie. I could see where tidy would appeal to him.</p><p>\u201cSo how come I was brought to you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an agreement with Missing Persons. We exchange information, and if someone comes in when they aren\u2019t here and I am, I take the report, then give them a copy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd vice versa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d Sullivan opened a drawer in his desk and yanked out a huge file. \u201cI\u2019ve been nosing around on my own. But lately, I haven\u2019t had any extra time to spare.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure why he was telling me this, except I\u2019d been told I was easy to talk to. The trait was a handy one since a lot of my work involved trying to get information, a confession, a name.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep at this when there\u2019s no connection between the victims?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He lifted his gaze to mine. \u201cBecause I found one.\u201d</p><p>I leaned forward. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe maj ority of the victims were missing before at one time or another.\u201d</p><p>Silence settled between us, broken only by the distant ring of a telephone.</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d I said, \u201cthe sudden influx of dead and missing were all previously missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all, but that may just be because no one noticed or no one reported it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich still doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re victims of a serial killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But it is a connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell your boss? The FBI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need more information before I make a fool of myself again.\u201d He stared at me for several seconds.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to look into this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone who\u2019s turned up dead or missing was missing before,\u201d he said slowly, as if speaking to a half-wit.</p><p>\u201cI got that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister is missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been missing a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems she went missing here last. Like a whole lot of other people.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. I didn\u2019t like what he wasn\u2019t saying.</p><p>Sullivan shoved the file over to my side of the desk, opened it and pointed to a list of names. \u201cThese are the missing and the dead; next to them is the last place they were seen.\u201d</p><p>My eyes skimmed the page, then I straightened as if I\u2019d been goosed.</p><p>\u201cAs you can see,\u201d Sullivan said, \u201cquite a few got on that list after visiting Rising Moon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that hard, Miss Lockheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne,\u201d I said absently, staring at the list, biting my lip, then glancing at the picture of Katie standing outside Rising Moon.</p> <p>\u201cAnne,\u201d Sullivan repeated. \u201cPeople have disappeared, some have turned up dead, and the last place they were seen was that j azz club on Frenchmen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoincidence is just another word for clue. Especially when you show up with a picture of a missing person in front of that cursed bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCursed?\u201d</p><p>New Orleans was the voodoo capital of America. If a police detective who believed in curses existed, I had no doubt he\u2019d work here.</p> <p>\u201cFigure of speech.\u201d His lip curled, revealing his disdain for the whole idea. \u201cAlthough there are rumors the building\u2019s haunted. I swear everything is around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s common in very old cities.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one shoulder. \u201cSomething\u2019s weird there; I just don\u2019t know what. The place reopened under new ownership about six months ago.\u201d</p><p>My head went up as I recalled Rodolfo saying he\u2019d been open less than a year, but six months...</p><p>Sullivan dipped his chin, answering the question I had yet to ask. \u201cJust when the dead and the missing began to double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t...\u201d I trailed off.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink that Rodolfo is a serial killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou met him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened. \u201cJust because he can play the sax and the piano\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiano?\u201d The image of those hands caressing the keys made me a little light-headed.</p><p>Sullivan\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cHe\u2019s a talented pretty boy, that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s also blind. I doubt he\u2019s capable of chasing people around the city and murdering them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe he has an accomplice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s so damn gorgeous anyone would be happy to be his murder buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know,\u201d Sullivan muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve seen crazier things than that.\u201d</p><p>I was certain he had. I\u2019d dealt with my share of cops. They saw a lot, most of it bad. That Sullivan was even pursuing this when he\u2019d been slapped down by both his boss and the FBI meant he cared. I had to admire that.</p><p>\u201cDid you check him out?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Sullivan gave me a long look. Of course he had.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a native of the city. Creole background.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d heard the word, but I wasn\u2019t exactly certain of its meaning.</p><p>Sullivan noted my confusion. \u201cCreoles are descendents of Europeans born in this country. The Spanish and the French settled New Orleans. The place feels French, but a lot of the architecture is Spanish, and Rodolfo is an old Spanish name.\u201d</p><p>Which explained his slight accent, although he didn\u2019t seem to be speaking English as a second language.</p><p>\u201cHow far back were his Spanish ancestors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few branches on the family tree, but around here they like to keep the past alive.\u201d</p><p>Understandable when the past lived and breathed on every street corner.</p><p>\u201cSo Rodolfo\u2019s got family in New Orleans?\u201d</p><p>Sullivan shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s the last of them according to the records. He left years ago, before he even graduated from high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows. Probably the usual stuff\u2014his parents didn\u2019t understand him; he wanted to be a rock star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did he go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe drifted, which made it damn hard to find out what he\u2019s been up to. I tried to track his Social Security number\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd were there a rash of unexplained deaths or disappearances in any city where he lived or worked?\u201d</p><p>Sullivan lifted a brow. \u201cYou\u2019ve done this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find a trace of him. He didn\u2019t file a tax return until last year.\u201d</p><p>That was odd, but not unheard of. Especially for a runaway who\u2019d probably lived on the streets.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna call the IRS?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Rodolfo was working for cash, playing sets in bars, getting paid under the table. People do it all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy Scout,\u201d I muttered, ignoring the glare he sent my way. \u201cHow did he lose his sight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t find anything on that either.\u201d</p><p>Strange. The loss must have been caused by an accident or an illness, maybe even a tumor. Incidents like that would leave a paper trail. Somewhere.</p><p>Unless he\u2019d been too down and out to go to a doctor and that\u2019s why he\u2019d ended up blind in the first place.</p><p>\u201cWill you help me?\u201d Sullivan asked.</p><p>Since the detective was right about Katie fitting the profile, such that it was, and I didn\u2019t have any more leads, or any pressing business in Philly\u2014</p><p>\u201cCan I take the file?\u201d</p><p>Sullivan grinned; the expression made me realize he was years younger than I\u2019d first thought\u2014late twenties instead of mid-thirties. Not that it mattered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make copies.\u201d He disappeared into a back room, and seconds later the whir of a machine drifted out.</p><p>I\u2019d agreed to stay, but where would I stay? Maybe Sullivan had a suggestion.</p><p>When he returned, he tossed the file onto the desk, and the sheet with the list of names spilled onto the floor. As I reached down to retrieve it, my eyes stuck on the repetition of the words \u201cRising Moon,\u201d</p><p>almost as if the place were calling to me.</p><p>Rising Moon was short handed; I had hands. The salary included a room, which I needed. And, conveniently, people were disappearing from there in droves. I should really keep an eye on things.</p><p>I doubted Sullivan would agree that I needed to be that close, so I just wouldn\u2019t tell him about it.</p><p>How crazy could Rodolfo be? He was running a successful business; he had employees, customers. If he talked to himself in the dark, not my problem.</p><p>Besides, we\u2019d already established that Rodolfo couldn\u2019t be the killer, but there might be someone at Rising Moon who was.</p><p>\u201cHow can I reach you?\u201d Sullivan asked.</p><p>I scribbled my cell phone number on a corner of a page, tore it off and handed it to him, my mind already moving ahead, trying to figure out how I\u2019d get a j ob in a j azz club when I knew nothing about j azz, and I\u2019d never been a waitress or a bartender in my life.</p><p>I left the police station after promising to stay in touch. Once outside I relished the coolness of the air just before dawn.</p><p>I had to call my parents, make up something. I couldn\u2019t tell them I was investigating a possible serial killer. They\u2019d flip about that even before I told them why.</p><p>Until I knew for certain Katie was a victim, I\u2019d keep my mouth shut. However, I did need them to send me more clothes.</p><p>I glanced at my watch\u2014five A.M.\u2014if I added the time difference they\u2019d be up in half an hour. I\u2019d just check out the Caf\u00e9 du Monde until then.</p><p>By the time I reached the cafe near the river, exhaustion threatened. Not that I hadn\u2019t pulled some all- nighters in my life, but everything that had happened since yesterday\u2014the envelope with Katie\u2019s picture, the travel, the emotional ups and downs\u2014had combined to make me dizzy with fatigue.</p><p>I discovered chicory coffee and beignets cleared that right up. By the time I ran up the staircase to the elevated walkway near the river, I was wired. I gazed at the sleepy city and wondered what had possessed the founders to build in the crescent-shaped bend of the Mississippi. Back then the place had to have been a mosquito-infested swamp.</p><p>My mother answered on the second ring, as if people called at dawn every morning. Of course, since Katie, every phone call could be \u201cthe call.\u201d</p><p>My choice of career hadn\u2019t thrilled my upper-middle-class parents. My dad was an accountant; my mother had been a nurse. Once Katie was born, she\u2019d stayed home and she\u2019d never gone back. I\u2019d think our family was lost in the fifties, except in that gilded decade daughters didn\u2019t often disappear and women didn\u2019t become private investigators.</p><p>\u201cMom, hi\u2014\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>Sometimes I swore the woman was psychic. Then again, they did have caller ID.</p><p>\u201cNew Orleans,\u201d I answered, and quickly told her as little as possible.</p><p>\u201cAnne, you don\u2019t even know if the girl in the picture is Katie,\u201d my mother said.</p><p>\u201cYes I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would someone send you a photo and not tell you who they were or why they took it?\u201d my father asked. As usual he\u2019d gotten on the extension the instant my mother said hello.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the person saw Katie\u2019s picture on a Web site or a poster and was surprised to remember her face from their vacation pictures.\u201d</p><p>My father grunted, as unconvinced of that as I was.</p><p>\u201cNot knowing when the photo was taken means it could date from before she disappeared and not after,\u201d my mother pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBut Katie never went to New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d I demanded. \u201cShe\u2019d just graduated from high school when she disappeared. Did she turn up missing at any other time I\u2019m not aware of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the one time,\u201d my mother whispered.</p><p>I wanted to smack myself for upsetting her, even as I fought not to break into a happy dance.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d I said excitedly. \u201cThe picture had to have been taken after Katie disappeared, and that means she was alive longer than the last night she was seen.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized until right then that I\u2019d been secretly afraid Katie was at the bottom of the Delaware River.</p><p>\u201cAnnie.\u201d</p><p>My mother was the only one who called me that. I was not the \u201cAnnie\u201d type. I didn\u2019t have curly red hair, couldn\u2019t sing a note, and in my opinion the sun did not always come out tomorrow. Tomorrow was usually a day full of clouds.</p><p>\u201cYou need to give this up now,\u201d she continued.</p><p>\u201cGive what up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour obsession with finding Katie. She\u2019s gone, honey. She isn\u2019t ever coming back.\u201d</p><p>I collapsed on one of the benches and stared at the Mississippi flowing peacefully by as if mocking the sudden gurgling, coffee-laced turmoil in my gut.</p><p>My parents had given up. They thought Katie was dead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed so much since we lost her,\u201d my mother murmured.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t we all?\u201d</p><p>Before, my parents had seemed young. They\u2019d laughed during meals, danced beneath the stars on warm summer nights, there hadn\u2019t been a speck of gray in their hair.</p><p>Afterward, they\u2019d aged, almost overnight. They never went anywhere, just in case Katie called. Later it was just in case someone found her. Lately...</p><p>Lately they\u2019d started going places again. They\u2019d even taken a vacation to Florida last month. Why hadn\u2019t I understood what that meant?</p><p>\u201cI need you to FedEx me some clothes,\u201d I said, ignoring what I didn\u2019t want to hear. \u201cWarm weather stuff, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long are you staying?\u201d my father asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should come home, Anne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Silence drifted over the line. Finally he murmured, \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure I could do that either.</p><p>\u201cWhere should I send the clothes?\u201d My mother scrabbled about for paper and a pen. She might despair of me, but she\u2019d always be there for me. Just as Katie had always been there.</p><p>Until she wasn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>The only address I knew was the one for Rising Moon, which I\u2019d written on the back of the photo. I recited it to my mother before we said, \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201cGood-bye.\u201d</p><p>The sun spread down the streets ahead of me like a golden carpet. Soon heat would rise from the pavement. Though Frenchmen Street had no doubt been rocking until only a few hours before, plenty of people still strolled the sidewalks.</p><p>The big windows on the front of Rising Moon were dark and uninviting. What had been sparkling and lively last night had turned dull and quiet, the unlit neon sign nothing but empty glass. Las Vegas must look like a real dump in the daytime.</p> <p>Figuring the place would be empty until mid-afternoon at least, I almost went back to the Quarter. I\u2019d peer in the shop windows and see if I could find a few cooler things to wear until Federal Express arrived.</p><p>Then a flicker of movement from beyond the glass had me reaching for the door. The knob turned beneath my hand. The scent of stale beer and old smoke wafted over me. I wrinkled my nose and went inside.</p><p>\u201cNot open till five.\u201d</p><p>The same buff bartender lifted chairs onto the tables. The floor was littered with cigarette butts and sticky from too many spilled cocktails.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come for a drink.\u201d I grabbed a nearby broom and began to sweep everything loose into a pile. \u201cI came for a j ob.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t pause, didn\u2019t even glance my way as he continued to lift chairs at a brisk pace. \u201cI thought you were searching for your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a place to stay and something to eat while I\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p><p>He stopped lifting chairs; I stopped sweeping crap. \u201cEver worked in a bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hired.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMardi Gras is breathing down our necks; we need help. You got a brain; you\u2019ll catch on.\u201d</p><p>I thought that might be a compliment, but I wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cI\u2019m Anne,\u201d I said. \u201cAnne Lockheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my name.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to ask if King was his first name or his last but figured that would be impolite.</p><p>He smiled at my obvious confusion. \u201cMy mama liked Elvis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the King.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d King tilted his head. \u201cYou want the j ob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I have to talk to the owner first?\u201d Not that I wanted to or anything.</p><p>\u201cHe don\u2019t have much to do with the day-to-day nonsense. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do I start?\u201d</p><p>King indicated the broom. \u201cYou just did.\u201d</p><p>In truth, I didn\u2019t have to work until that night around eight P.M. when things got busy. King ran the bar. I would take drink orders for the tables. How hard could it be?</p><p>\u201cMinimum wage, plus tips,\u201d he said, as he led me upstairs. \u201cAnd this.\u201d</p><p>King pushed open a door to reveal a single room: bed, chair, nightstand, dresser; the empty closet gaped without a door. Though the color scheme screamed mid-seventies\u2014gold and olive green\u2014at least it was clean.</p><p>\u201cBathroom\u2019s here.\u201d He crossed the hardwood floor, not an area rug to be had, and flicked on a light.</p><p>Bright white tile, a claw-footed tub framed by what appeared to be a brand-new shower curtain.</p><p>\u201cSecond floor\u2019s empty but for you right now. If we\u2019re lucky, more help will stumble in. If not, I\u2019ll get temp workers from out of town for Fat Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I asked. \u201cI thought a room was part of the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work so much that when I get away, I need to get away.\u201d</p><p>I could relate. My apartment in Philly was above my office. Talk about a one-track life.</p><p>I was tempted to ask where John Rodolfo lived, but I didn\u2019t want King to think I was a groupie.</p><p>\u201cYou trust me enough to let me live here alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou plannin\u2019 on stearin\u2019 from us, cher?\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows lifted at the casual endearment. \u201cUh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so. \u2018Sides, I take the money with me. You want to steal booze, it\u2019s your headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kitchen. All the soft drinks and coffee you want are free for the askin\u2019. No alcohol when you\u2019re working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine by me.\u201d I wasn\u2019t much of a drinker. Never had managed to acquire a taste for it.</p><p>\u201cOtherwise,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou\u2019re in New Orleans. We got food on the street corners, at the grocery store. You can\u2019t throw a stick and not hit someone cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want to get some sleep. You\u2019ll be on till the place clears out. Could be early or late dependin\u2019 on how much the folks like the music.\u201d</p><p>The idea of lying down on that bed, drawing the shades, checking out for a while, was enormously appealing, as was the allure of a shower and a change of clothes.</p><p>\u201cAre there different bands every night?\u201d I asked.</p><p>King nodded. \u201cLocals mostly. Play for tips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew Orleans has always been more about the music than the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich musicians bring in the most customers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe crowd depends on Johnny.\u201d</p><p>Johnny ? Rodolfo looked the least like a Johnny of any Johnny I\u2019d ever known.</p><p>\u201cIf he decides to play,\u201d King said, \u201cpeople come in off the street after just a few notes, word gets around, other bars clear out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s that good?\u201d</p><p>King lifted one bushy black brow. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t feel it?\u201d</p><p>If I hadn\u2019t heard Rodolfo play the night before I wouldn\u2019t have known what King meant. But I had heard him and I had felt it. A tug from deep inside, a part of me that recognized the beat and wanted more, a pull that was almost sexual. No wonder women followed him into the \u201cprivate\u201d room for a quickie.</p><p>\u201cSometimes it seems like he\u2019s possessed by the music,\u201d King murmured, \u201cor maybe it\u2019s just the music possessing everyone else.\u201d</p><p>What a strange thing to say.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to know him well,\u201d I ventured.</p><p>His gaze flicked to mine, and I was struck again by the oddly light shade of his eyes. \u201cJohnny and I are two of a kind.\u201d</p><p>I awoke to a darkness so complete I wasn\u2019t quite sure where I was. Then someone laughed, a drum went ba-bump , and a horn gave a tentative toot. Rising Moon was open for business. With all that noise, I doubted I\u2019d be doing much sleeping during normal sleeping hours. But beggars couldn\u2019t be choosers, and by next week my days and nights would be all turned around anyway.</p><p>Which was probably why the last person who\u2019d lived in this room had purchased curtains so heavy they blocked out every scrap of light. There\u2019d been a lot of day sleeping going on.</p><p>I showered, pleased to discover the water pressure didn\u2019t suck, then pulled out a change of clothes, which were pretty much the same clothes I\u2019d had on before, only cleaner. After twisting my hair into a French braid, I was ready. Never had worn makeup; I didn\u2019t own any. Putting paint on my face was like putting paint on a two-story Colonial\u2014still the same old, same old underneath\u2014a little color couldn\u2019t change the structure.</p><p>The stairs outside my room spilled out near the rear door, which stood open tonight. The scent of something spicy and dark, almost burned but not quite, made my mouth water. I hadn\u2019t eaten since the Cafe du Monde.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have time now, but for a minute I just took in the scent, so tantalizing it was almost a taste. I had to force myself not to follow my nose like a cartoon dog floating on the trail of a delicacy.</p><p>The band of the evening played a slow, earthy tune and I swayed with the rhythm. My eyes closed; a breeze blew in through the screen door, both cool and warm at the same time, smelling of sun and water and midnight.</p><p>I heard a shuffle out there in the dark, and my eyes snapped open. I peered through the screen, even though common sense shouted for me to retreat to the busy, loud area where all the people were. Too bad one of my best, and worst, traits had always been curiosity.</p><p>What was out there? A rat? A dog? Or something more dangerous?</p><p>The glow of a cigarette flared; steamy white smoke trailed toward the sky, and twin moons appeared in the center of Rodolfo\u2019s sunglasses as he turned in my direction.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here in the dark?\u201d I blurted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dark?\u201d</p><p>Okay, that had been a really stupid question. What difference did the dark make to him, and I could see very well that he was smoking. But\u2014</p><p>Where had he come from? At first glance, I\u2019d seen nothing out there but the night.</p><p>He took another drag from his cigarette, one of those long, slim, antique-looking cigarillo types I imagined plantation owners had smoked as they watched their slaves toil away in the tobacco fields.</p><p>\u201cSmoking is bad for you,\u201d I said.</p><p>He actually laughed. One quick bark that didn\u2019t sound amused. \u201d Chica, the whole world is bad for me.\u201d</p><p>Rodolfo continued to stare in my direction, the flat reflection of the moon in his glasses unnerving. \u201cWhat were you doing upstairs?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>For an instant I wondered how he had known I was up there, but then, my mother always told me I came down steps like an elephant.</p><p>\u201cI live there, work here.\u201d</p><p>He tossed the cigarette with a lazy flick, the burning tip sailing downward like a scarlet falling star.</p><p>Though his footsteps thumped slowly against the pavement, he reached the door so fast I didn\u2019t have time to escape. Not that I had anywhere to go.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to work here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney? The room? Your charming personality?\u201d</p><p>He ignored my attempt at humor. It hadn\u2019t been much of an attempt.</p><p>\u201cYou should go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am home. For now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant go back wherever it is you\u2019re from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me here?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d meant to be sarcastic, but the question came out sounding anything but. What I\u2019d sounded like was a lost, frightened little girl, and lost, frightened little girls often disappeared.</p><p>Rodolfo took a deep breath, almost as if he were smelling me. Maybe it was just an intensification- of-the-senses thing\u2014he couldn\u2019t see me, so he smelled me? It should have been weird, but what it was, was exciting.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want\u2014\u201d he said tightly, and took a step closer.</p><p>I stepped back, and he cocked his head, pausing. When he spoke again, his voice was normal\u2014or as normal as that sexy voice ever got. \u201cI want you gone.\u201d</p><p>Funny, I didn\u2019t think that was really what he wanted, and despite his strange behavior, I didn\u2019t want that either. Everything about him fascinated me.</p><p>\u201cKing said he was in charge,\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Rodolfo crossed the short distance to the screen door and, after minimal fumbling, opened it and strode past me into the tavern. As soon as the crowd saw him they began to cheer. He raised a casual hand but didn\u2019t stop, going straight to the bar and waiting for King.</p><p>Rodolfo said a few words; King said several back. I inched closer.</p><p>\u201cWe need her,\u201d King snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Johnny, the girl will be useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d Rodolfo muttered, then turned and headed for the performance corner amid backslapping and welcoming shouts.</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand what was going on. Rodolfo seemed both attracted and repelled by me. Why, when he couldn\u2019t even see me? Maybe it had something to do with my smell.</p><p>King beckoned, and I met him at the end of the bar.</p><p>\u201cWhad you say to him?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>King glanced in Rodolfo\u2019s direction. \u201cHe said your voice calls to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that bad?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cFor Johnny it is.\u201d King glanced at Rodolfo with a worried expression as he began to play the piano.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>King walked away without answering.</p><p>I stared at John Rodolfo and remembered last night. Him in the dark on one side of the door, me in the hallway listening to him talk to himself.</p><p>Maybe he heard a lot of voices. Maybe they told him to do things I didn\u2019t want to know about. Like kill people.</p><p>Suddenly leaving didn\u2019t sound half bad.</p><p>King shoved a notepad and pencil into my hand. I stared at them for a moment, then lifted my gaze. \u201cI thought I was fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t even started yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I flicked a glance toward Rodolfo, who was now doing something to the piano that made me think of tangled sheets and sultry Louisiana nights.</p><p>\u201cJohnny might own the place, but he don\u2019t own me. Besides.\u201d King shrugged. \u201cWe got no one else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrite down orders. I fix the drinks. You take them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tell you how much they owe. You get it. And remember whose drink is whose. They like that.\u201d</p><p>The evening progressed. I\u2019d figured I wouldn\u2019t have too tough of a time remembering which person got which drink, but when you\u2019re trying to write down one thing while someone else is telling you another, people are laughing, chattering, music is playing, and you\u2019ve got three other tables waving at you... it\u2019s easy to forget.</p><p>I started to write short descriptions next to their drink. Vodka tonic\u2014red shirt. Miller Lite\u2014blue eyeshadow. That worked pretty well.</p><p>What didn\u2019t work was showing Katie\u2019s picture. Some people barely looked, some refused to. They were on vacation; it was almost Mardi Gras, and they didn\u2019t want to hear about missing sisters.</p><p>Laissez les bons temps router!</p><p>At any rate, no one in Rising Moon that night would cop to seeing her. The more I thought about it, the dumber the showing of the picture seemed to be. What were the chances I\u2019d stumble across someone who\u2019d met Katie?</p><p>Pretty damn slim. Of course, that didn\u2019t mean I was going to stop doing it.</p><p>Rodolfo played a long time. First the piano, then the sax; he sat in with one band and stayed for</p><p>another.</p><p>The crowd swelled. Everyone was thirsty. My ancient athletic shoes, chosen for comfort rather than support, were not suitable for the j ob. My feet ached all the way up to my eyeballs.</p><p>I was so busy I didn\u2019t see him leave. But suddenly the crowd thinned, and when I glanced at the performing corner, a woman played the piano and there was no saxophone to be had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>That night i fell into bed exhausted and was asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow, only to come awake with a gasp and a start in that darkest of hours just before the sun appears on the horizon.</p><p>My heart was thudding so hard my straining ears could hear nothing but ba-bump, ba-bump, ba-bump .</p><p>What, if anything, had woken me?</p> <p>I\u2019d lived alone in Philadelphia; I shouldn\u2019t be freaking out about being the only living soul inside Rising Moon.</p><p>Except Philly was home. New Orleans was a strange place, with an emphasis on strange.</p><p>Something scraped across the floor above me. I sat up; my neck creaked when I lifted my chin toward the ceiling and squinted. I don\u2019t know what I expected to see. I didn\u2019t have X-ray vision.</p><p>Holding my breath, I waited, but I didn\u2019t hear anything else.</p><p>Still, something had woken me, made me nervous, even in dreamland. I wasn\u2019t an easily spooked person, but I doubted I\u2019d be able to sleep again until I made certain all I\u2019d heard was a mouse, or a loose shutter, or the wind rippling through the eaves.</p> <p>A few moments later, dressed and creeping barefoot up the back steps, I wished like hell for a flashlight, but there hadn\u2019t been one anywhere in my room.</p><p>A scrabble, like fingernails against wood, sounded just ahead.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I called.</p><p>Something shot down the stairwell, something dark and small that screeched like the banshees of legend.</p><p>I flattened myself to the wall as it flew by.</p><p>Only when it had disappeared into the well of black below did the sound the beast had made register.</p> <p>\u201cA cat,\u201d I managed. \u201cOnly a cat.\u201d</p><p>Thunk.</p><p>My eyes lifted. \u201cOr not.\u201d</p><p>A cool breeze seemed to swirl in from nowhere, turning the sweat on my body to ice, and along with the breeze traveled an all too human whisper.</p><p>I\u2019d never believed in ghosts; I was too practical for that. Of course, I\u2019d never been confronted with one either. Seeing has always meant believing in my book.</p><p>Sullivan had referred to Rising Moon as \u201cthat cursed bar.\u201d He\u2019d said there were rumors the place was haunted, though from his manner he didn\u2019t believe it. I hadn\u2019t either.</p><p>However, standing in the whispering night all alone, I was forced to rethink my opinion.</p><p>I had to know the truth, so I took the remaining steps to the door at the top, turned the knob and walked in.</p> <p>Despite my wide and staring eyes, I saw nothing, the darkness so complete it surrounded me like a velvet curtain. In the depths, something growled.</p><p>I flung out my arm, fingers groping along the wall. One flick and light glared down on the tiny room from the single bare bulb in the ceiling.</p><p>Near the heavily shrouded window stood a bed. In it a figure tossed and turned, moaning, muttering.</p><p>John Rodolfo seemed caught in the grips of a nightmare. He\u2019d thrown off the covers; he wasn\u2019t wearing any clothes.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but see; I wasn\u2019t blind. I couldn\u2019t help but admire; I wasn\u2019t dead.</p><p>His skin glistened with a fine sheen of sweat, which only emphasized the rippling muscles and smooth olive skin. For a musician he sported some mighty nice pecs and a decent set of abs. Had he been bench-pressing pianos?</p><p>Embarrassed to have walked in on him like this, I started to back out of the room, but he continued to thrash and moan as if in horrible pain and I hesitated.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t leave him like this. I\u2019d had nightmares\u2014a lot since Katie disappeared\u2014and I knew I\u2019d rather be woken than forced to finish one.</p><p>\u201cRodolfo?\u201d</p><p>The only response was another moan.</p><p>\u201cJohn?\u201d I spoke a little louder as I stepped a bit farther into the room.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he shouted, thrashing and straining upward as if someone were holding him down.</p><p>Now what? The sound of my voice seemed to be making him worse.</p><p>I stood in the doorway, uncertain. Should I shake him awake? That seemed forward, even for me. I bit my lip, shuffled my feet, sighed, and he stopped thrashing, turning his face toward the door. \u201cAnne?\u201d</p><p>I considered escaping to my room and saying nothing, but that would be cowardly, and I refused to allow it.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI heard a noise. I didn\u2019t realize you lived here.\u201d</p><p>He sat up, reaching for the sheet, then drawing it across his lap. The motion only caused my gaze to slide there ahead of the white cotton, and I got an eyeful of something else that was mighty nice. I needed to get laid\u2014soon\u2014before I did something, or someone, really stupid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014uh\u2014\u201d He put a hand to his forehead; he wasn\u2019t wearing his sunglasses. This was the first time I\u2019d seen him without them, and he looked younger, even with his eyes shut.</p><p>Strange. Why keep them shut? Unless\u2014</p><p>Before I could stop it, my mind flashed on an image of him opening his eyes to reveal gaping sockets. I winced and turned away. Just because the man couldn\u2019t see me didn\u2019t mean I should stare at him while he was undressed and dopey from sleep.</p><p>\u201cI get headaches,\u201d he said. \u201cI come up here to lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMigraines?\u201d I glanced back as he patted the night-stand, found his glasses, slipped them on.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>I needed to leave; the poor man was recovering from a migraine. I\u2019d never had them, but my mother did and whenever she woke up she was woozy from the pain if not the meds.</p><p>Nevertheless, I found myself moving closer. \u201cHave you always had migraines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His lips turned up ruefully. \u201cThey\u2019re a recent development.\u201d</p><p>Ding-ding-ding ! A head injury might cause blindness, which would also explain the headaches.</p><p>\u201cDid a trauma cause you to lose your sight?\u201d</p><p>He choked, the sound one of surprise and... amusement? \u201cTrauma?\u201d he repeated. \u201cI guess you could call it that.\u201d</p><p>I waited for him to be more specific, and when he remained silent, I asked. I couldn\u2019t help myself. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I can explain,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>I opened my mouth, shut it again. I couldn\u2019t make myself keep pressing him. I guess there was a limit to how far even my curiosity would take me.</p><p>\u201cWill the headaches go away eventually?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNot if they\u2019re penance for my sins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA j oke. Never mind.\u201d</p><p>He got to his feet, wrapping the sheet around his hips and securing it with a quick, practiced twist. Then he padded to the sink, splashed his cheeks with cold water and slicked his hair back so sharply droplets of liquid flew, pattering against the ancient wooden floorboards like rain.</p><p>\u201cDoes it make you uncomfortable to be alone with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I lifted my gaze from the floor to his face. The sunglasses shrouded his eyes. Whoever had coined the phrase \u201cwindows to the soul\u201d had known what they were talking about. Not being able to see Rodolfo\u2019s eyes was really starting to bug me. The mirrored glasses made it seem like he had no soul.</p><p>I let out a short, derisive laugh\u2014at both my thoughts and his question. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd even if it did, this is your place. You can stay here if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an apartment on St. Ann. I don\u2019t use it much. It\u2019s easier...\u201d his voice trailed off.</p><p>I understood. He worked here, why traipse several city blocks, especially when getting there couldn\u2019t be all that easy for him? The convenience of this third-floor room had to far outweigh any need he had to get away.</p><p>\u201cI should thank you for letting me stay,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWith Mardi Gras coming up.\u201d He shrugged, the muscles in his arms and chest flexing, rippling beneath the skin like smoothly flowing water. I hoped I wasn\u2019t drooling, but at least he couldn\u2019t see me if I was.</p><p>\u201cBeggars can\u2019t be choosers, oui?\u201d</p><p>His use of French startled me a bit. \u201cI thought your ancestors were Spanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am what I am. My family is long gone.\u201d He turned away. \u201cEveryone I ever knew here is dead.\u201d</p><p>The desolation in his voice called to me. I understood loss and grief, the nostalgia that both helps and hurts. Which was the only reason I crossed the room, reached out and touched him.</p><p>He\u2019d warned me not to. Why couldn\u2019t I learn?</p><p>At the first hint of flesh against flesh he spun so fast my eyes detected only a blur. His hands closed over my elbows, his palms so hot I flinched at the sensation if not the pressure as his fingers tightened just a little too much.</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d I began, and he cursed, the words a jumble of Spanish and French, muttered too low to be understood even if I\u2019d ever been any good at either language.</p><p>I stared at my reflection in his glasses; I didn\u2019t look as frightened as I felt. Once again I appeared prettier than I was, both alluring and enticing. No wonder he kissed me.</p><p>My mouth opened on a gasp as he yanked me onto my toes and covered my lips with his. He didn\u2019t hesitate; he took; he ravaged; I liked it.</p><p>I was not the type of woman men devoured. Or at least I hadn\u2019t been before today. Today John Rodolfo kissed me as if he\u2019d been waiting to do so his entire life.</p><p>He savored my mouth as if he planned to memorize every inch. His teeth scraped my bottom lip, the slight pain a bloom of pleasure even before he laved the tiny hurt, then suckled. His grip on my arms gentled; I didn\u2019t run away. Instead, I sighed, surrendering.</p><p>The short, neat mustache and goatee were both sharp and soft, a new sensation that tempted me to rub my cheek against his face\u2014and several other places.</p><p>The sheet slithered to the floor, and I barely noticed, my mind and body centered where we touched. My skin tingled as if static electricity flowed from him to me. I\u2019d never felt so alive.</p><p>He tasted like midnight. He smelled of summer rain. His hair beneath my fingers was slick and wet and far too short. I couldn\u2019t help it; I ran my hand from his neck over his shoulder, down his chest, then lower still.</p><p>Right before I reached his belly he stumbled back, bending to grab the lost sheet, then covering himself, though nothing was going to disguise the erection that made a pup tent of white cotton just below his hips.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>His head went up. \u201cThis is a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeemed like a terrific idea from my end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are things you don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d He shoved his fingers through his hair, pausing when he encountered the stubbly strands.</p><p>I opened my mouth to ask \u201cWhat things?\u201d then shut it again as the bright light from the ceiling bulb hit</p><p>Rodolfo\u2019s raised hand.</p><p>A thin white scar bisected his wrist.</p><p>My gaze flicked to his left hand, twisted in the sheet around his waist. I couldn\u2019t see if there was a corresponding line there, but it didn\u2019t matter. One was enough to reveal the truth.</p><p>Once upon a time, John Rodolfo had tried to kill himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Suddenly I wanted to get as far away from the man as I could. Not only were there things I didn\u2019t know about him, there were things he didn\u2019t know about me. For instance, I wasn\u2019t working here out of the goodness of my heart. I was trying to discover if someone at Rising Moon was a serial killer.</p><p>Uneasy, my gaze flicked again to his wrist, then away. What could have enticed him to suicide? Too many murders?</p><p>I doubted it. Serial killers liked to kill. They felt no remorse. That was why they were serial killers. They killed again and again and again until someone stopped them.</p> <p>I had enough problems in my life. I didn\u2019t need to be involved with a man who had a death wish\u2014 even if he kissed like the devil and looked like an angel. I let my gaze trail over his well-trimmed goatee and perfect, half-naked body.</p><p>Or maybe it was the other way around.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d I said, backing toward the door. \u201cBad idea. Employer, employee. All sorts of trouble.\u201d</p><p>One black eyebrow lifted above the sunglasses. \u201cI\u2019m so happy you see it my way.\u201d</p><p>His voice was cool and sarcastic. If I hadn\u2019t just been swapping spit with the man I\u2019d think he had no emotions at all.</p> <p>But I had been and he did. I\u2019d felt the desperation in his embrace, tasted the lust on his tongue. He\u2019d wanted me as much as I\u2019d wanted him, and he\u2019d also been frightened of it. Wanting someone that badly for no reason at all wasn\u2019t quite sane.</p><p>So who was crazier? Him? Or me?</p><p>\u201cWill you be all right?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The question had been a courtesy. Kind of like asking, \u201cHow are you?\u201d upon meeting someone. You didn\u2019t really want to know.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Rodolfo waved a hand toward the door. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p> <p>That was more the answer I\u2019d expected, yet still I hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been alone for eons, _chica\u201d _ he said softly. \u201cI prefer it.\u201d</p><p>I imagined year upon solitary year in the dark, thinking, brooding. No wonder he talked to himself.</p><p>\u201cI need to sleep a while longer.\u201d He touched his fingers to his forehead.</p><p>How could I have forgotten his migraine? I suppose being kissed senseless was a good excuse\u2014or maybe a poor one.</p><p>\u201cI could bring you some aspirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing that helps is sleep.\u201d Rodolfo returned to the bed. \u201cTurn out the lights. Shut the door.\u201d</p><p>He reclined, removing his glasses, setting them on the nightstand with nary a fumble, keeping his eyes closed the entire time.</p> <p>He\u2019d dismissed me. Slightly annoyed, I did as he asked. Or should I say as he\u2019d ordered? There were times he reminded me of some lord of the manor, ordering his servants about, expecting them to obey without question.</p><p>My watch read five-thirty a.m. I was exhausted. Maybe I could catch a few more hours of rest myself.</p><p>As I hurried toward my room, one of the doors along the corridor creaked open, and I paused. No one else was supposed to be in the building.</p><p>I looked up. Or so I\u2019d thought.</p><p>I stepped closer to the gaping doorway. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>No one answered. No kidding. Did I expect an intruder to pipe up and say, \u201cI was hiding in preparation to kill you, but since you caught me, never mind?\u201d</p><p>Before I could think about how dumb the action was, I opened the door all the way to the wall, just in case someone was lurking behind it, and flicked on the light.</p><p>The room was empty, musty, and unoccupied as promised. However, a single candle glowed in the corner.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t lit it. I peered at the ceiling. I also kind of doubted Rodolfo had. Then again...</p><p>I crept closer, planning to blow out the flame\u2014definitely wasn\u2019t safe to just leave it here\u2014and I noticed several things.</p><p>The wax had melted into a glistening puddle, which indicated the wick had been lit hours ago. The candle was set on a low table and surrounded by stones, feathers, tiny carvings\u2014a dog, a cat, a pig, and a chicken. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think I\u2019d stumbled on a child\u2019s playroom. Except there was something vaguely unsettling\u2014both sinister and saintly\u2014about the whole thing.</p><p>The low table, the candle, made me think altar, while the other items brought to mind\u2014</p><p>Voodoo?</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>I knew next to nothing about the religion; this could be it. Or something else entirely.</p><p>Though my unease increased as I neared the candle, I forced myself to cross the room, lean over and blow.</p><p>Poof . Out went the flame.</p><p>Then I saw the dark, wet streaks marring the wood surface of the table. In the bright light, they resembled blood.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be,\u201d I muttered, and the way my voice shook made me realize it could be, probably would be.</p><p>I should call the police, but Rising Moon wasn\u2019t my place, and what if, in New Orleans, an altar like this was commonplace? What if it was for protection or success or even to welcome Mardi Gras?</p><p>I backed away, resolving then and there to show King before I did anything foolish. It wasn\u2019t as if the altar could walk away. Slowly I shut the door behind me and headed for my room.</p><p>The candle and all the trimmings would still be there come morning.</p><p>Except they weren\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why I was surprised.</p><p>I got up as soon as I heard a door close downstairs, threw on my now crusty clothes and left my room, stopping at the door of the one where I\u2019d seen the altar the night before.</p><p>Nothing was there.</p><p>Just to be sure, I checked every other room too, even my own.</p><p>Zilch.</p><p>Now who was slightly crazy ?</p><p>I considered telling King what I\u2019d seen, but what good would it do? The events of last night had begun to take on a surreal quality, including the embrace with John Rodolfo. Maybe I\u2019d imagined everything.</p><p>I kept what I\u2019d seen to myself. For all I knew King could be a serial killer\u2014though the odds were against it. For some reason no one can quite figure out, serial killers tended to be white, middle-aged men.</p><p>However, he could be the owner of the altar. If the thing was religious, it was none of my business. If it was sinister, I didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>I should probably tell Sullivan, though without proof that the altar had ever existed... why bother? Without a burning need to see King, I returned to bed. When I awoke about midafternoon, a Federal Express box sat outside my door full of lovely, clean clothes. I took a shower and donned some denim shorts and a T-shirt. Then I grabbed Sullivan\u2019s file, and without even checking to see if anyone was puttering around Rising Moon, I headed for an Internet cafe I\u2019d spotted on Chartres Street.</p><p>Set back from the main thoroughfare, the tables within a walled garden were occupied by an assortment of locals and tourists. Inside, next to the coffee bar, a long, narrow room was full of computers.</p><p>I paid for a latte, a bran muffin, and an hour of Internet use, then got down to business.</p><p>I did my usual search of names, background, credit information. I found nothing that Sullivan hadn\u2019t already.</p><p>As I sipped my coffee, I took out the list of victims, complete with the locations of the disappearances and deaths, as well as the dates. There was something about the dates of the earlier victims that bugged me. They seemed to occur at regularly scheduled intervals.</p><p>I pulled up an astrological Web site and typed several of them in.</p><p>\u201cDing-ding, we have a winner,\u201d I murmured. People seemed to disappear and die more often than not on the nights of a full moon.</p><p>That really wasn\u2019t so odd. Ask anyone who works the night shift anywhere and you\u2019ll learn that a full moon equals crazy time. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a lot of serial killers preferred to do their work beneath its glow. I had a bad feeling that a full moon made blood shine more brightly.</p><p>Out of curiosity I continued to type in dates. As they became more recent, the pattern fell apart. Six months ago, when the murder/disappearance rate doubled, only a few had occurred on a full moon night.</p><p>And there went my theory.</p><p>Nevertheless, I typed \u201cfull moon\u201d and \u201cNew Orleans\u201d into the search engine. What I got back was\u2014</p><p>\u201cVoodoo.\u201d That figured.</p><p>\u201cYou interested in voodoo?\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head. The girl who\u2019d waited on me at the counter\u2014her nametag read MAGGIE\u2014was stuffing empty cups into the trash and sterilizing abandoned computer kiosks.</p><p>She didn\u2019t appear a day over sixteen, though I figured she must be. Her hair had been dyed an impossible shade of black, which matched the liner rimming her light blue eyes. She\u2019d be pretty if she didn\u2019t try so hard not to be. I didn\u2019t much care for the tattoo of a snake on her skinny pale arm either, but it wasn\u2019t my arm.</p><p>I glanced at my watch. My time was almost up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know much about it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>I straightened. Wasn\u2019t that convenient?</p><p>\u201cThere are several voodoo shops in town,\u201d she continued, \u201csome are just for the tourists, some are the real thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe real thing?\u201d</p><p>My skepticism must have been evident in my voice because Maggie stopped cleaning and met my gaze.</p><p>\u201cVoodoo is a legitimate religion. There\u2019s an initiated priestess with a shop and a temple on Royal Street, though she hasn\u2019t been in as much since she had the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe voodoo priestess had a baby,\u201d I repeated dumbly.</p><p>Maggie\u2019s lips quirked. \u201cAbout eight months ago. A boy. All his fingers and toes\u2014not a scale or a tail to be found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha,\u201d I said, really hoping she was kidding.</p><p>\u201cThere are a few other places I can direct you to, if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d Nice Protestant private investigators did not visit voodoo priestesses, even for fun. It gave us a rash.</p><p>The girl craned her neck to see past my shoulder. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t interested, why are you looking up voodoo on the Internet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just messing around. You said you know a little about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve studied some.\u201d</p><p>I gave a mental shrug. What could it hurt to ask? \u201cI typed in \u2018full moon\u2019 and \u2018New Orleans\u2019 and got back</p><p>\u2018voodoo.\u2019 Any idea why?\u201d</p><p>Her brow creased. \u201cCertain ceremonies take place under the full moon.\u201d</p><p>I returned to the astrological Web site and wasn\u2019t surprised to discover that last night there had been one.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of ceremonies?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, any ceremony works better under a full moon. There\u2019s incredible power there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I said, unconvinced about the power of the moon. \u201cI saw a low table with a candle, feathers, stones\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn altar.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d thought as much. \u201cThere were also red streaks\u2014maybe paint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably the blood of a chicken or a pig.\u201d</p><p>God, I hoped so, but since the blood had been as gone as the altar when I\u2019d come back, I\u2019d never know for certain.</p><p>\u201cWhat would an altar be used for?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cTo contact the loas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe immortal spirits of voodoo, they act as a bridge between God, known as the Gran Met, and humankind. Think of them as the saints, angels, and demons of Catholicism. The candle\u2019s flame represents a bridge between our world and the next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone want to contact voodoo spirits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever is asked. Did you notice anything else on this altar? Each of the loas has a particular item they prefer as an offering and each one has a specialty\u2014something only they can grant us lowly mortals. An altar for Aida-Wedo might have drawings of rainbows or other items that represent the sky, which are offered in exchange for fertility.\u201d</p><p>Note to self\u2014do not leave an offering for Aida-Wedo.</p><p>\u201cThere were just the stones and feathers,\u201d I said slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhich are common elements to all voodoo altars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tiny animals.\u201d</p><p>Maggie frowned. \u201cAnimals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarved. From wood, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey reminded me of\u2014\u201d I searched for the word. \u201cTotems. But those are Native American, not voodoo, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of carved animals being placed on an altar, though sometimes there are dolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoodoo dolls?\u201d</p><p>Maggie shook her head. \u201cVoodoo dolls aren\u2019t true voodoo. They came from Europe not Haiti and were part of the witchcraft traditions there. Any voodoo dolls you see in New Orleans are for the tourists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are the dolls on the altars for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey represent the loa and have nothing to do with curses.\u201d</p><p>Interesting that she brought up curses, considering I\u2019d found the altar in a supposedly cursed, haunted bar.</p><p>\u201cCould what I saw have been an attempt to remove a curse?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Maggie thought a minute. \u201cMight also have been an attempt to place one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>This was all foolishness. I didn\u2019t believe in curses; I thought voodoo was a j oke. But someone at Rising Moon obviously didn\u2019t share my opinion.</p><p>\u201cYou should really talk to a person who\u2019s more knowledgeable than me about the religion,\u201d Maggie said.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to know quite a bit.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled, pleased. \u201cAs I said, I\u2019m interested. You can\u2019t live here and not be.\u201d</p><p>I probably could, but that was just me.</p><p>\u201cI bet if you called Priestess Cassandra,\u201d Maggie continued, \u201cshe could help you figure out what those animal carvings were for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to bother a voodoo priestess with a new baby.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d had a couple of friends in the same situation. After a few weeks of sleep deprivation they resembled Linda Blair, croaking obscenities as their heads spun round and round. And they\u2019d just been regular old new moms. I did not want to mess with a cranky voodoo priestess.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s the most knowledgeable voodoo practitioner in the city from what I hear,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cShe even went to Haiti on some kind of pilgrimage. You should see her snake.\u201d</p><p>No, I shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d I said as I gathered Sullivan\u2019s file.</p><p>\u201cCassandra\u2019s on Royal,\u201d Maggie called as I left the cafe. \u201cShop by the same name, you can\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my hand in good-bye and kept going.</p><p>My phone rang as I headed toward Frenchmen; a glance at the caller ID revealed a local number.</p> <p>\u201cAnne, can you meet me?\u201d I instantly recognized Detective Sullivan\u2019s low clipped voice.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d I stopped walking and turned toward town. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a place called Kelly\u2019s on Orleans. Do you know it?\u201d</p><p>I knew none of the places here, but I had a feeling I was going to learn. \u201cI\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>With Bourbon Street as a center point, locating things wasn\u2019t hard. The French Quarter extended from Esplanade to Canal in one direction and from Rampart to the Mississippi in the other\u2014a total of about ninety-eight blocks.</p><p>I found Kelly\u2019s without any trouble\u2014a small, narrow tavern among a host of others. Sullivan was already at the bar, nursing something clear and sparkly, with ice. His big hand enveloped the smaller container, and he downed the drink in a single gulp, then nodded at the bartender for another.</p><p>\u201cLong day?\u201d I asked, sliding onto the stool beside him.</p><p>The man behind the bar rilled Sullivan\u2019s glass with clear soda. Interesting. Most cops I knew would have been drinking straight vodka, and I wouldn\u2019t blame them.</p> <p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Sullivan answered. \u201cWhat\u2019ll you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d I smiled; so did he, the expression starting a warm glow just below my breastbone. Conner Sullivan was a nice man, and I met so damn few of them.</p><p>My mind flashed on last night\u2014make that early this morning\u2014Rodolfo and I in the attic, him naked, me wanting to be. My face flushed, and I downed my drink in several large gulps.</p><p>\u201cLong day?\u201d Sullivan repeated.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d I motioned for another.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRising Moon.\u201d</p><p>His lips, which had still been curved appealingly upward, turned in the other direction. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a j ob at Rising Moon. The salary includes a room on the second floor.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan blinked, several times, long and slow. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the time.\u201d I emptied half my second soft drink. I should probably have ordered water, but the sugar really tasted good after a night with so little sleep.</p><p>\u201cWhen I told you I wanted your help on this, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me to actually do something?\u201d I interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think sleeping in the lion\u2019s den is classified as anything other than suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Does he know who you are?\u201d</p><p>I knew precisely whom Sullivan meant by \u201che.\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told him you\u2019re a private investigator, looking for your missing sister and working for me because I think he\u2019s a serial-killing psycho?\u201d</p><p>When he put it like that\u2014\u201dNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRodolfo knows I\u2019m searching for my sister.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan waited, but I didn\u2019t elaborate, because there was little else to tell.</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad idea,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIf people are disappearing from Rising Moon, someone should be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf people are disappearing, you could be next.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and took another sip. I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cHave you been undercover before?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Setting my glass down slowly so I wouldn\u2019t slam it, I faced him. \u201cYes. My license isn\u2019t just for show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Philly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich will be so much help if you\u2019re dragged into the swamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself, Detective.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, just signaled for another round. We were both going to be hopped up on sugar before this was through.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you call me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure you had a room. It didn\u2019t occur to me last night that the city was filled to the brim.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you going to suggest that I stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell between us. Dull red crept up his neck. \u201cI have an extra room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI checked you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cAnd what did you find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exactly who you say you are. You\u2019re single-minded in your devotion to finding your sister. No black marks on your record. You\u2019d make a good cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d For a man like him, who seemed to live and breathe his j ob, that had to be the highest praise.</p><p>\u201cHow did you end up in New Orleans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gave me away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLack of an accent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I got rid of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that? You\u2019ve got to take heat every day for being a Yankee.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMore when I first came than now. People got used to me.\u201d</p><p>In a city that had tallied more than its fair share of police corruption, Sullivan had to be an icon, or maybe a curiosity. In the wake of Katrina, at least fifteen percent of the NOPD had deserted their posts and many were caught looting. I doubted Sullivan had been one of them. I was certain that those who valued honesty and integrity and devotion to duty were able to overlook Sullivan\u2019s lack of Southern charm.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a chance to read the file?\u201d he asked, neatly turning the subj ect away from himself.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Did you notice a pattern in the dates of the disappearances and deaths?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of pattern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI typed them into an astrological Web site.\u201d</p><p>He straightened. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil six months ago, the maj ority of disappearances and deaths in New Orleans took place on the night of a full moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re thinking we\u2019ve got a werewolf?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFull moon, disappearances, deaths. Doesn\u2019t that equal werewolf to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m Lon Chaney Junior. You don\u2019t actually think werewolves exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but there might be someone who does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone who thinks he\u2019s a werewolf?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt could happen.\u201d</p><p>Not a bad theory, except\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe full-moon connection falls apart about six months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Rodolfo showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Except the full-moon madness stopp ed then.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan grunted. \u201cWeird shit has been going on around here for a long time. I told you there were several deaths by animal attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve gathered, there\u2019ve been whispers of wolves in and around this city for over a century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA century,\u201d I repeated dumbly.</p><p>\u201cThe wolves that have been seen are big\u2014timber-wolf size, even though this climate doesn\u2019t support timber wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He cast me a quick glance. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to tell you what I know.\u201d</p><p>I waved my hand. \u201cLead on.\u201d Into loony tunes land.</p><p>\u201cA lot of the earlier reports were attributed to red wolves, which we had at one time, though they were declared extinct in the wild around nineteen eighty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done your research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about coyotes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose we have. They were brought in to deplete the nutria rat population in the swamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a nutria rat?\u201d It didn\u2019t sound like anything I wanted to meet in a spooky, overgrown bog.</p><p>\u201cRodents that resemble beavers with a ratlike tail. They got out of hand a while back and had to be depleted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHence the coyotes. You think your animal deaths might have been them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoyotes don\u2019t attack people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd wolves do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, unless they\u2019re starving or rabid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwell,\u201d I muttered. Just what every big city needed\u2014rabid wild animals run amok.</p><p>\u201cAfter one of the animal attacks, when a swamp guide\u2019s throat was torn out, I called in an expert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of expert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolf hunter.\u201d</p><p>I gave a short, sharp bark of laughter. \u201cWhere the hell did you get one of those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepartment of Natural Resources.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That made sense. \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScary old German guy went hunting in the swamp for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he have an explanation for a wolf where one wasn\u2019t supposed to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid it happens all the time. People make pets of wild animals\u2014usually get them when they\u2019re little and cute. Then they grow into something not so little and far from cute, and they dump them. The animals can\u2019t survive in the wild; they\u2019re starving, but they also have no fear of humans, a bad combination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the hunter find anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne wolf, which he killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we had another suspicious death by animal attack, but this time it was in the Quarter.\u201d</p><p>I j olted. \u201cA wolf came right into town?\u201d That did not sound like any wolf I\u2019d ever heard of.</p><p>\u201cNot a wolf. A big cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re not referring to a twenty-pound torn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t kill full-grown women. This had to be some kind of wildcat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a zoologist look at the crime scene. The animal left spore. Marking territory as animals do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you got wildcats in Louisiana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobcats.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cThey aren\u2019t that big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig enough, and if the animal was rabid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it would be violent and aggressive,\u201d I finished.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>I stared into his face. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t a bobcat, was it?\u201d</p><p>Sullivan shook his head. \u201cI had the spore analyzed. Leopard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in brown with black spots, not native to this country?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think someone had a pet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be. We\u2019ve seen the news stories of tigers turning up in Manhattan apartment buildings.\u201d</p><p>I never had been able to figure out how people could be that stupid. Sure, a tiger cub is cute\u2014all babies are\u2014but they grow up, grow teeth, and then they turn on you.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened after the death by leopard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Sullivan\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cWe never found the leopard\u2014dead or alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBummer.\u201d</p><p>He shot me a glare. \u201cThere\u2019ve been reports of wolves here and there. Always are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople must mistake coyotes for wolves all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever confirm what kind of animal killed the other victims?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think that would be something easy enough to figure out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. If the bodies didn\u2019t keep disappearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got disappearing bodies.\u201d I was starting to wonder how sane Sullivan was.</p><p>\u201cNot disappearing exactly. They\u2019re in the morgue, and then they\u2019re not. Some are never seen again. Some are seen all over the place.\u201d He cast me a quick glance. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does sound a little far-fetched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you a copy of the reports.\u201d</p><p>I stared into his eyes for several seconds, then shook my head. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p><p>Why would he lie? Why would he offer to get me reports if there weren\u2019t any reports to get? And if there were, that made the disappearing, reappearing dead people true.</p><p>The jukebox in the corner changed tunes with a thunk and a slow metallic whir. As if on cue, Patsy Cline began to sing \u201cCrazy,\u201d and Sullivan snorted. \u201cMy boss actually sent me to the local voodoo priestess to see if she knew anything about the bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra?\u201d I asked.</p><p>His gaze sharpened. \u201cYou know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard of her. She seems to have quite the rep around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems to show up a lot when things get weird, but I guess that\u2019s to be expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did the priestess say when you confronted her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe denied raising any zombies.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened. \u201cI thought we were talking about werewolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZombies. Werewolves.\u201d Sullivan rubbed between his eyes. \u201cThis place messes with your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever find any of the bodies that disappeared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d He dropped his hand. \u201cTurned up barbecued in St. Louis Number One.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d walked past that cemetery at the edge of the French Quarter. Since New Orleans is below sea level \u2014a fact everyone learned too well in August of 2005\u2014citizens are buried inside brick monuments known as ovens. All those chalk-white markers and above-ground tombs were pretty creepy, but they didn\u2019t explain a barbecued corpse.</p><p>\u201cYou lost me,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cBody disappears, a day or so later we\u2019ve got two flaming corpses in St. Louis Number One. DNA tests revealed one to be our missing victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA recently deceased elderly woman who\u2019d been buried a few days before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCult?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Hell, probably. Voodoo is rampant around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, voodoo isn\u2019t a cult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot usually, but who\u2019s to say what some nut might make it into?\u201d</p><p>He had a point. Take a person on the edge of reason, combine with a religion that walked the line between natural and supernatural, and you might come up with a body-stealing cult.</p><p>Sullivan finished his soft drink, then set down the empty glass with a click. \u201cThere\u2019s something going on just below the surface,\u201d he murmured. \u201cLike a whole other world exists that most people aren\u2019t aware of.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Now who sounded crazy? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Sullivan stood and tossed some money onto the bar.</p><p>I thanked him and glanced at my watch.</p><p>\u201cGot an appointment?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to work tonight.\u201d</p><p>We stepped onto the street. Dusk had arrived, giving the Quarter a sleepy air that would disappear quickly when complete darkness fell and neon lit up the sky. No one could be sleepy then.</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Sullivan stopped me with a hand on my elbow.</p><p>\u201cI know. But I have to.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, and for a minute I thought he meant to argue, then he gave a quick grin. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan tilted his head. \u201cYou got a boyfriend back home in Philadelphia?\u201d</p><p>The question was so out of place after what we\u2019d been discussing, all I could say was, \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you, Anne. I wouldn\u2019t mind spending time with you. Is that so bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d walk with you, maybe buy us a po\u2019 boy on the way. Ever had one?\u201d</p> <p>I stared into his open, honest brown eyes. No secrets there. The lack of them was very appealing.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I answered.</p><p>A po\u2019 boy turned out to be a sandwich\u2014kind of a submarine, but better. A huge slab of French bread stuffed with shrimp and oysters, sausage, or roast beef. Pretty much whatever you asked for.</p><p>We stood in line at a window on Decatur. I ordered mine with ham; Sullivan opted for medium rare roast beef, undressed, which meant plain. I wanted dressing, which got me lettuce, tomato, and an unbelievable mustard that made my taste buds twinkle.</p><p>We ate as we walked, like so many others. I was amazed at how many people carried plastic cocktail glasses, or even beer bottles on the street. That combined with the amount of to-go windows at the bars made me think the laws on public alcohol consumption were virtually nonexistent.</p><p>\u201cMust be hard to keep things under control,\u201d I murmured as we passed another weaving, two-fisted, drinking tourist.</p><p>\u201cThe mounted police on Bourbon really help. The officers can see over the crowds, and people give way to a horse. It\u2019s also pretty hard to outrun them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, there have to be fights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be Mardi Gras season without them. But most people are here for a good time; they\u2019re happy.</p><p>If not, we throw them in j ail and by morning they see reason.\u201d</p><p>I had a feeling it was a bit more complicated than that, but I let it go.</p><p>By the time we neared the less touristy section of Decatur Street, we\u2019d finished our po\u2019 boys and washed them down with a bottle of water. I had to work, and Sullivan didn\u2019t appear to be much of a drinker. I liked that about him. Among other things.</p><p>I stopped walking. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not a good idea for anyone at Rising Moon to see me with a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d He swept a wisp of hair from my eyes, his fingertips trailing across my brow. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. When it came to looking for Katie, I was often reckless.</p><p>Sullivan leaned in, brushing my lips with his own. The kiss was sweet, soft; he smelled really good, like sunshine and cinnamon. I was so shocked, I just stood there; I didn\u2019t even pucker up.</p><p>\u201cSee you.\u201d He turned and headed back in the direction of Bourbon.</p><p>I stared after him, wondering what had just happened. Had that been a date or a meeting? An end or perhaps a beginning? More importantly, what did I want it to be? I wasn\u2019t quite sure.</p><p>Darkness had fallen and what appeared to be a full moon shone. I knew that a true full moon lasted only one night and that what I observed was slightly lopsided, though not enough to be seen by the human eye.</p><p>Which made the long, low howl that rose toward the silver orb even weirder. If there were no wolves in New Orleans, and werewolves only came out under a full moon, then what the hell was that?</p><p>I gave a little snort of derision at my thoughts. There was no such thing as werewolves, and that howl had most likely been a coyote. I was a city girl. I had no idea what a coyote, a wolf, or even a dog howl sounded like.</p><p>The wind ruffled my hair, amazingly chilly despite the fading heat of the day. I glanced around uneasily.</p><p>Where had all the people gone?</p><p>Behind me, farther down Decatur, there were plenty. Ahead of me, on the shady street that was Frenchmen, a small knot milled. But right here, no one.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d I muttered, and hurried along the broken sidewalk in the direction of Rising Moon.</p><p>The howl came again, but this time I got the impression a pack of furry beasts serenaded the bright, shiny moon. Strange, but it sounded as if they were just down the street, back in the direction Sullivan had gone.</p><p>I spun around, eyes searching the steadily descending gloom. Where was he? I should be able to see him walking away, but I didn\u2019t. How could I miss him? He was huge.</p><p>Uneasy, I started after him. In my peripheral vision I kept catching a hint of shadows in the alleyways.</p><p>Shadows with decidedly canine shapes. However, when I glanced directly at them, nothing was there.</p><p>I reached the busy section of Decatur. Tourists, tourists everywhere and not a cop to be had.</p><p>I forced myself to draw several calming breaths. Sullivan had used a shortcut, that was all. I was certain there were a hundred of them, and a New Orleans detective would know every one.</p><p>Now that I was no longer alone, all I heard was the beat of the music pouring from the open door of every tavern; all I saw was the neon. I was tempted to grab the nearest person and ask them if they\u2019d seen any really big dogs or heard strange howling, but considering the intoxicated euphoria of everyone around me, I wouldn\u2019t be able to believe them regardless of what they said.</p><p>I j ogged toward Rising Moon, passing nothing but empty, glistening alleyways, until I reached the bar.</p><p>At the end of the long, narrow gap between buildings a man stood smoking. Even before he turned his face and the nearly full moon glinted off his glasses, I knew who he was.</p><p>My heart went ba-boom. Sullivan\u2019s sweet and gentle kiss was forgotten as memories spilled into my mind</p><p>\u2014the taste of his mouth, the feel of his skin, the scent of his hair. The stark, white line across his wrist.</p><p>I should avoid John Rodolfo like the shadowy wolves that run in the night. Instead I took a single step toward him, and he disappeared around the corner. Before I could stop myself, I plunged into the alley, hurrying along until I burst out the other side.</p><p>The only thing left was a whiff of cigarette smoke on the wind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Rodolfo never showed up that night, and the resulting crowd was thin.

He\u2019d taken off before I could ascertain it was actually him\u2014although who else would have been standing outside the bar wearing sunglasses beneath the moon?</p><p>\u201cStrange.\u201d King slid the beer to the customer, then slid the money into his huge hand. \u201cHe don\u2019t usually disappear so early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he had another headache.\u201d</p><p>The big man\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 you can do for him when he\u2019s like that. \u2018Cept leave \u2018im alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirlie, that boy\u2019s got troubles galore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that too.\u201d I handed him my tray and notepad. \u201cYou said no one else lived here but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho has a key?\u201d</p><p>His head tilted as he considered the question. \u201cMe, you, Johnny. A weekly cleaning crew. The accountant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about former employees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always get the keys back.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean someone hadn\u2019t made a copy.</p><p>King frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I still didn\u2019t want to share the disappearing altar with anyone, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou know anything about voodoo?\u201d</p><p>His expression chilled, making his oddly light eyes appear even lighter. \u201cYou think because I\u2019m black I know voodoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I was just curious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe curious someplace else. I\u2019m a Baptist, born and bred. I don\u2019t hold with that hoodoo shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cForget I asked.\u201d</p><p>I headed to my room, stepping gingerly on the staircase lest the black cat show up again. I should have asked King what its name was.</p><p>My cell phone beeped. I checked the message, figuring it would be from one or the other of my parents, calling to make sure my clothes had arrived safely. I was right and wrong. The first was from my mother asking just that. The second was from Sullivan.</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to make sure you got back okay.\u201d A long silence followed before he murmured, \u201cCall me.\u201d</p><p>I dialed his cell, left my own message. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Thanks for the sandwich and the\u2014\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure what to call it. \u201cConversation,\u201d I decided. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>The scent of smoke clung to my hair and clothes so I took a shower, let the hot water beat on my sore shoulders and slightly achy feet. Waitressing wasn\u2019t for sissies.</p><p>Strangely enough, I kind of liked it. I got to talk to people, show Katie\u2019s picture. I felt like I was doing something, when for months I\u2019d been doing nothing. I wasn\u2019t having any luck, but at least I was trying.</p><p>Who knew? The phrase \u201clike finding a needle in a haystack\u201d actually contained the word \u201cfinding.\u201d It could happen.</p><p>I glanced around my rented room and was surprised by the wave of loneliness that washed over me.</p><p>Sure, I was far from home, but I\u2019d often felt the same in Philly where I lived only ten minutes from my parents. I was alone in a way only a twenty-three-year-old single woman can be. I ached for someone, but there was no one.</p><p>I forced myself to turn off the lights, get into bed. The music ended downstairs, but I could still hear the thrum of voices, the occasional high-pitched laughter. Not enough to keep me awake if I\u2019d been at all tired.</p><p>I stared at the ceiling. While I should have been thinking of Katie, or even the case, coming up with some sort of plan, instead I found myself thinking of John Rodolfo, wondering where he went when he walked the night, what he did, who he was.</p><p>I drifted in that place where time can both fly and crawl, when we\u2019re not quite asleep, but we aren\u2019t awake either. I saw him wandering in the fog, as alone as I was, wanting someone with whom to share the darkness.</p><p>I j erked upright. Rising Moon had gone completely silent below me. I glanced at my watch. Three hours had passed.</p><p>The moon shone through my window, creating a silver path between it and my bed. The distant howl of a train, the wind, or something with fur, split the night.</p><p>I listened as it died away and an odd tap-tap took its place. Curious, I slipped out of bed and followed the silver trail to the window.</p><p>The street lay deserted except for a solitary figure moving slowly in my direction, weaving a bit as if drunk, tapping a white cane tipped with red along the pavement in front of him.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I was surprised to see Rodolfo with a cane. Without a dog or a companion, how else would he traverse the city? Still, the apparatus made him seem more vulnerable than he ever had before.</p><p>As if in answer to my thoughts, he stumbled, nearly going to his knees before righting himself. Was he drunk?</p><p>Before I could think better of it, I left my room, flying down the back stairs and out the door. It wasn\u2019t until the warm wind brushed my bare arms and legs that I remembered I wore nothing but a pair of boxers and a thin tank top.</p><p>I hesitated for only a moment, then left the shadow of the building and hurried across the street. No one was out here but the two of us, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d I began, then stopped when I saw the blood on his shirt.</p><p>Cursing, I ran the remaining steps to his side, grasping his elbow, gentling my hold when he winced.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMugged,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>His j aw sported a darkening bruise, as did his cheek. I wondered momentarily how he\u2019d managed to keep his glasses from getting busted, then became distracted by the way he held his body, protectively, as if he\u2019d cracked a rib. The fingers curled around the cane had lacerations on the knuckles.</p><p>\u201cWhere? Why?\u201d I demanded, and he smiled, just a tiny uptilt of his lips, but I was done for. He was so damn beautiful he made me dizzy.</p><p>\u201cI believe the why of it was money, chica. Isn\u2019t it always?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could anyone mug a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlind man?\u201d he finished. \u201cYou can say it. I know that I\u2019m blind.\u201d</p><p>My mouth twitched. The better I got to know him, the better I liked him. Which wasn\u2019t good. If I was going to be attracted to a man for the first time in forever, why couldn\u2019t I be attracted to someone like Sullivan?</p><p>Because that would be too easy.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said shortly. \u201cHow could anyone mug a blind man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch more easily than they can mug a sighted man. Some people are desperate.\u201d He tried to take a breath, but thought better of it when pain made him grimace. \u201cI understand desperate. I can\u2019t fault them too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d I muttered, wishing the culprits had tangled with me instead. \u201cWe need to get you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stiffened. \u201cNo doctors. I\u2019ve had enough of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to go upstairs.\u201d He indicated Rising Moon with a j erk of his head.</p><p>I wondered momentarily why he\u2019d come here instead of going to his apartment, but maybe he\u2019d been closer. Or maybe he\u2019d just needed help, and he\u2019d known I was here.</p><p>The thought caused a flutter in my belly. I don\u2019t know why I enj oyed being needed. Maybe since I was unable to help Katie, I helped everyone else that I could. Or perhaps it was just because I was good at it.</p><p>As Rodolfo stepped off the curb, he caught his cane in a crack and wobbled. I snatched his free hand, and he j erked back. I tightened my fingers around his. \u201cLet me help.\u201d</p><p>After a few seconds, he did.</p><p>Minutes later we reached the third-floor room. He sat on the bed as I hurried into the bathroom. He had very little in the way of first-aid supplies. He had very little in the way of anything\u2014some soap, toothpaste, a few washcloths and towels.</p><p>I came out with the cloths. \u201cI\u2019m going to get some ice and some whiskey.\u201d He tilted his head quizzically.</p><p>\u201cAlcohol for those knuckles. Can\u2019t hurt. Actually, it probably will hurt, but less than an infection. Did you catch those on someone\u2019s teeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be,\u201d he said, and I realized he probably didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d hit. That he\u2019d hit anything was pretty damn amazing.</p><p>Hurrying into the tavern, I found a few empty plastic bags and filled them with ice, then grabbed a cheap bottle of whiskey\u2014the alcohol content was the same regardless of the price\u2014and ran back up.</p><p>I stopped dead just inside the door. Rodolfo had removed his shirt and was dabbing at his chest with one of the washcloths. His back to me, I was momentarily captivated by the play of muscles beneath smooth, bronzed skin. I wanted to run my tongue all over him.</p><p>He reached for his shirt, and I caught a glimpse of his chest before he covered it. Several raw slices marred the once perfect flesh.</p><p>\u201cThey had a knife?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>He buttoned a few of the lower buttons, shrouding his abdomen from view before I stopped him with a hand on his. \u201cI should clean those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just scratches. I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could get an infection.\u201d</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>\u201cLet me\u2014\u201d I took a step forward; he took a step back.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He held out the stained washcloth. \u201cI can do it.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for several seconds, but my evil eye had no effect. Finally I doused the cloth with whiskey and handed it to him. He turned away, dabbing at the injury.</p><p>He seemed almost shy, as if he didn\u2019t want me to see him, was afraid to let me touch him, and that did not fit with the man I knew. Although how well did I really know him?</p><p>\u201cWhy do you go out alone?\u201d I asked.</p><p>John glanced over his shoulder; the reflection from the light bulb bounced off his sunglasses, making me blink. \u201cThis is my city. Always has been.\u201d He tossed the red-tinged washcloth aside and spread his beautiful hands. \u201cI love her. I can\u2019t stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if she kills you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven then,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I doubt it\u2019ll come to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u201d\u2014he finished buttoning his shirt\u2014\u201dI am very hard to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really.\u201d I moved closer, careful to make enough noise so he knew I was coming. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to die.\u201d</p><p>I had just reached for his hand, preparatory to wiping his skinned knuckles with alcohol, but paused at his words and rotated his wrist upright.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I asked, and traced the thin white line that shone starkly in the light from the bare bulb hanging above us.</p><p>His skin twitched beneath my touch, and he tried to pull away. I held on.</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThings are different now. I\u2019m different.\u201d</p><p>I wished I could see his eyes, maybe then I could tell if he was lying. But it seemed too forward to tug his I sunglasses from his face as I held his scarred wrist in I my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I frowned, surreptitiously casting a glance at his other wrist. No scar. I wasn\u2019t sure what that meant.</p><p>\u201cThis is really none of my business,\u201d I said. \u201cUnless you\u2019d like to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, biting the word off sharply, giving the intonation a foreign twist. There were times when he spoke like a European gentleman from years gone by, others when he spoke like any other guy. John Rodolfo was a mystery in more ways than one.</p><p>I turned his hand back over, holding on tightly when he tried to pull away. \u201cI need to clean these knuckles now.\u201d</p><p>He stopped struggling. The alcohol on the scraped, bleeding mess had to have stung, but he stood stoically and let me do my worst\u2014or maybe it was my best.</p><p>Now that I got a good look at them, they weren\u2019t as bad as they\u2019d first seemed. The dimmer light of the moon must have made the scrapes appear deeper. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need a bandage,\u201d I murmured, and he pulled slowly away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should put ice on your cheek, those ribs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve always been a fast healer.\u201d He took a slug of the whiskey, making a face as he swallowed. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was from the taste or the quality. Maybe both.</p><p>\u201cYou might have a broken rib. Let me check.\u201d</p><p>I placed my palm against his side and he froze, his body going as still as his face. Beneath my hand, his chest barely rose and fell, the movement as shallow as the cuts on his knuckles.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d he asked, his voice a bit hoarse from the alcohol.</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d I said, and he laughed, the sound so foreign, so startlingly sweet, I lifted my head, captivated.</p><p>Then I was caught, staring into his glasses, mesmerized, as my fingers pressed one rib, then another. I didn\u2019t think either one of us was breathing anymore.</p><p>\u201cDoes this hurt?\u201d I managed.</p><p>\u201cNot as much as it\u2019s going to,\u201d he muttered, and kissed me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>His tongue tasted of whiskey and though I\u2019d never been a fan, I wanted to suck on it, on him, and draw every inch of the flavor within.</p><p>I burned, yet his skin was hotter than mine, my fingers seemingly ice-cold against his heat. He moaned into my mouth, began to lift his head, end the kiss, and I wrapped my fingers around his neck, holding on.</p><p>He hesitated, even stopped kissing me for a minute, but when I nipped his lip, pressed my breasts against his chest, then slipped one finger beneath the waistband of his trousers and over the tip of his erection, the hesitation ended. If his reaction was anything to go by, he hadn\u2019t had sex in nearly as long as I had.</p> <p>The kiss that followed was long and wet and unbelievably thorough. He learned every inch of my mouth, as those clever, long-fingered artist\u2019s hands explored the curve of my waist, the slope of my breasts, the swell of my rear. The latter made me shudder with reaction as his hand met the bare skin of my thigh. I wanted to feel every inch of him naked against every inch of me.</p><p>His glasses tapped my nose, and I reached for them, but he swung me around, backing me against the wall. Though my eyes were closed, I sensed the room go dark, even as I heard the muted flick of the light switch.</p><p>I opened my eyes; the room was completely black, the curtains drawn so that not even a flicker of moonlight penetrated the darkness. His mouth left mine, caressing my chin, then the curve of my throat as he moved lower, his hands sliding higher, cupping my breasts, teasing my already hardened nipples through the thin layer of my tank top.</p><p>The press of his erection was just a little too high to be of any help so I grabbed his hips, went on my tiptoes and felt his gasp of both shock and excitement as everything came together just right.</p><p>Suddenly I was spinning out of control, twirled around, off balance, unable to see. My cheek met the wall, the chill of the smooth surface startling against my heated skin.</p> <p>He nibbled my neck as he murmured words I didn\u2019t understand in Spanish, maybe Italian, even a little French, his breath icing the moist imprint of his mouth, making me shiver with cold, then shudder with the awareness of his body pressed tightly to mine.</p><p>I should have felt trapped, maybe a little scared. We were alone at Rising Moon; he was bigger than me, stronger, and possibly crazy. But we weren\u2019t doing anything I didn\u2019t want to do; arousal far outweighed any fear.</p><p>His teeth scraped my neck, and I caught my breath, the sound sharp and loud in the stillness that surrounded us. He froze, mouth hovering just above my skin, and I ached for him to\u2014</p><p>\u201cDo it again,\u201d I whispered, arching my back, offering my neck like a sacrifice. .</p><p>He tensed, and the movement rode his erection along my backside in an enticingly intimate way.</p><p>Muttering curses in several different languages, he grasped my hips and whirled me back around, lowering his lips to mine.</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d meant, but I found it hard to complain with his tongue down my throat. Despite the voice in my head, which chattered that I was going to be sorry if I banged the boss, I didn\u2019t really want to complain. He tasted so good, this had to be right. With him kissing me, I couldn\u2019t be sorry about anything except that we were wearing too many clothes.</p><p>I slipped my hands under his shirt, ran my palms over the smooth, muscular expanse of his back. Though I would have liked to touch his chest, I still had the presence of mind to remember the thin, red slices he\u2019d dismissed as mere scratches. Whatever they were, I had no doubt they hurt, so I did my best to keep my roving fingers away.</p><p>We both lost our heads; I\u2019m not sure why. One minute my back was at the wall, and he was kissing me as I traced my palms over his shoulders. The next we were tumbling onto the bed in a tangle of limbs and clothing, buttons popping, elastic snapping, shoes flying, as we desperately attempted to get naked.</p><p>The attempt was mostly successful. I don\u2019t think I got his pants completely off; they might have been hanging from one ankle; my tank top ended up bunched over my left bicep. It didn\u2019t matter. I had to feel his skin against mine.</p><p>Warmth enveloped me; he gave off heat like an open flame; the hair on his legs brushed softly against my thighs as he settled between them. This time when I tugged on his sunglasses he let them go.</p><p>I resisted the urge to touch his eyelids, a greater intimacy than the one we would soon share. I didn\u2019t want to do anything that might make him stop. My body was humming with arousal, perched on the precipice of release. If I screwed this up, I\u2019d never forgive myself.</p><p>He nudged my knees apart; I opened for him gladly and the next instant he was inside, the slick, hard beat of him pushing, pulsing, bringing me closer and closer to the edge.</p><p>I strained upward, searching for that final touch that would make everything right, and he stilled deep within. His arms trembled; his breathing became labored.</p> <p>\u201cJohn?\u201d I murmured, and if possible he tensed even more.</p><p>Afraid he\u2019d withdraw and leave us both undone, I locked my legs around his, tilting myself more intimately against him. With a sound that was part arousal and part surrender, he began to pump his hips, faster and faster, deeper and deeper, the thrusts almost rough, but I didn\u2019t mind. I wanted the friction; I needed the heat; I awaited the explosion with my eyes wide open to the night.</p><p>Lowering his lips to my breast, he scored the curve with his teeth. Pain and pleasure became one, and I urged him on with murmurs and moans. He laved my nipple with his tongue, drawing me into his mouth and suckling as his lower body continued to thrust.</p><p>My body tightened, milking him, yet still it wasn\u2019t enough. He lifted his head, rising above me, driving into me, grasping my waist with his once gentle hands and just holding on.</p><p>The orgasm went on and on, and when I thought I was done, when I was gasping, limp and languid, he reached between us, his thumb finding my clitoris, working it, riding it, making me come again, stronger this time, so hard I sobbed, and at last he cried out, emptying all of himself.</p><p>I drifted toward sleep before the heat between us had even cooled. The last thing I remember was Rodolfo tugging the covers up, even as he inched away.</p><p>I reached for him, and he took my hand, then kissed my knuckles. \u201cGo to sleep, chica. I won\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, I trusted him, and I relaxed. But as oblivion closed in I thought I heard him whisper,</p><p>\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d</p><p>And I had to wonder the same thing myself.</p><p>When I awoke he was gone. I shouldn\u2019t have been hurt. When he\u2019d said he wouldn\u2019t leave, I doubted he\u2019d meant forever.</p><p>What have I done?</p><p>The words flitted through my head. Had he said them, or had I only imagined he had because I\u2019d been thinking them myself? In the bright light of day I had other concerns.</p><p>There\u2019d been no mention or use of a condom.</p><p>I sat up. Though I was on the pill, had been since I was sixteen and got tired of missing two days of school every month with excruciating menstrual cramps, I didn\u2019t have to worry about an unwanted pregnancy. Just unwanted\u2014</p><p>\u201cDisgusting diseases,\u201d I muttered, and smacked myself in the forehead with the heel of my hand.</p><p>I\u2019d heard stories of people so carried away by the moment they\u2019d forgotten anything but that. I\u2019d always scoffed.</p><p>Until today.</p><p>I glanced at my watch. Nine a.m. Far too early for nightwalkers like Rodolfo and me to be up. Where was he?</p><p>A door closed downstairs, and I leaped out of bed, crossed to the window, stepping over my scattered clothes as I went. Drawing back the curtains, I saw Rodolfo walking away with a man I didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cMust have an appointment.\u201d</p><p>The sound of my own voice, relieved, a little wistful, made me stiffen, then snatch my clothes and quickly put them back on.</p><p>I had no claims on him. What did I care if he wasn\u2019t here when I woke up? We had separate lives. This had been a one-night stand. It wasn\u2019t going to happen again.</p><p>Along with my unease over the missing condom, I felt a little guilty over the night\u2019s activities. Rodolfo had been hurt, and I\u2019d jumped him. Not that he\u2019d complained, but he was a guy. He\u2019d no doubt have sex on his deathbed if possible. I should have put a stop to things before they went too far, except I\u2019d been as out of control as he was.</p><p>My cheeks heated. What was wrong with me? I barely knew the man.</p><p>Or at least I\u2019d barely known him last night. This morning, at least physically, I knew him pretty damn well.</p><p>Such behavior was unlike me. I was a plain, hometown girl, who spent her days and most of her nights working. I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend; I didn\u2019t go on dates; I only entered bars to check out leads on Katie.</p><p>Yet I\u2019d come to the Crescent City and started slinging drinks, roaming the night, and sleeping with strangers. If I didn\u2019t know better I\u2019d think I was under a spell.</p><p>Annoyed with myself, I stomped downstairs to my own room and pulled back the covers on my bed.</p><p>\u201cJust because they call this place the voodoo capital of America doesn\u2019t make it true.\u201d</p><p>I picked up my pillow and a small cloth bag tied with string fell to the floor. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tentatively I lifted the tiny sack to my nose, sniffed and then sneezed\u2014once, twice, again. The scent was not unpleasant, kind of musty, dusty, but also pungent and sharp, like red peppers cooked over an open flame.</p><p>Probably just potpourri, though I\u2019d never known anyone to stuff potpourri into a pillowcase. Maybe it was a Southern thing.</p><p>With a shrug, I tossed the bag into the trash. If there was one thing I didn\u2019t need it was an annoyance that might keep me awake when I should be asleep.</p><p>I managed to doze most of the day, rising with just enough time to shower, dress, and run down to the Central Grocery on Decatur for a muffuletta sandwich.</p><p>According to the propaganda, the muffuletta is a Sicilian creation. Though the Cajun and Creole cultures get the most press in New Orleans, Italians began coming to the city in the 1880s and formed a fairly large contingent.</p><p>I\u2019d heard there might be a long line there, but I lucked out and only had to stand behind five people before I placed my order.</p><p>What appeared to be French bread was slathered with olive oil, olive salad, Italian cheeses, and salami. I wolfed mine down on the way back to Rising Moon, and considered going back for another. God, it was good!</p><p>If I ate like this for every meal, I\u2019d put on ten pounds in a week. However, I was only managing one meal a day in between sleeping and my shift. At that rate, I might lose ten pounds, which wouldn\u2019t hurt me. Did losing ten pounds hurt anyone?</p><p>There was no sign of Rodolfo when I arrived at work, and as the night wore on, and he didn\u2019t show up, the crowd dwindled, and King got mad.</p><p>\u201cWhere in hell is he?\u201d King smacked a tumbler onto the bar so hard I figured the glass would crack; instead Southern Comfort sloshed over the brim and onto his hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I set the glass on my tray. Not exactly a lie, I didn\u2019t know where he was. And what good would it do to tell King that Rodolfo had been with me last night? The information wasn\u2019t relevant.</p><p>Or was it? Had the man taken off because he couldn\u2019t face me?</p><p>I stifled a wince as I delivered the drink to an older woman who sat at the front window, staring at the crowd on Frenchmen. Was she waiting for someone too?</p><p>Annoyed with myself, I spun away and ran smack into a massive chest sporting a tie shaped like an electric guitar.</p><p>\u201cOomph.\u201d I stumbled back, and Detective Sullivan caught me.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He waited until I had my balance before releasing me. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I glanced around, but no one was paying us any mind, including King, who was once again engaged in the seemingly never-ending j ob of loading the dishwasher with dirty glasses. \u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought we agreed that I shouldn\u2019t be seen with...\u201d I waved my hand in his general direction.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come to see you.\u201d He smiled. \u201cThough that is a nice bonus.\u201d</p><p>I automatically smiled back. He was such a nice guy. Why didn\u2019t I want to rip his clothes off the way I wanted to rip off Rodolfo\u2019s? My smile faded and Sullivan\u2019s did as well.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAnne.\u201d King\u2019s voice made me turn. He frowned at Sullivan. \u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d</p><p>My brows lifted. \u201cYou know each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been hasslin\u2019 Johnny for months now.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan was unperturbed by King\u2019s hostility. \u201cIs he here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d King said, and returned to the dishwasher.</p><p>Sullivan followed, pulling a photograph from his j acket and placing it on the bar. \u201cSeen this guy?\u201d</p><p>King stopped loading long enough to take a peek. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis man, Harvey Klingman, was last seen at Rising Moon,\u201d Sullivan said, and my stomach dropped.</p><p>I inched closer, trying to see the photo, but the detective\u2019s big shoulders blocked it from view as he leaned over the counter to hear King\u2019s response.</p><p>\u201cI suppose he disappeared like the rest.\u201d King didn\u2019t even glance up. \u201cAnd just like those times, I don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about it or him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that people come in here and never make their way home again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what it is,\u201d King said slowly. \u201cA coincidence.\u201d</p><p>Around us voices rose and fell, glasses clinked, someone laughed. Sullivan drew in a deep breath, then let it out again. He tapped the photo with one thick finger. \u201cThis guy didn\u2019t disappear. I know right where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you wastin\u2019 my time?\u201d King snapped.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s in the morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I blurted. \u201cThe usual reason,\u201d Sullivan said dryly.</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cI meant, how did he die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to say for certain.\u201d The detective glanced over his shoulder at me, then back at King. \u201cSomeone set him on fire.\u201d</p><p>I started, remembering the barbecued bodies in the cemetery.</p><p>\u201cWhether fire was the cause of death,\u201d Sullivan continued, \u201cor a way to cover up the cause has yet to be determined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about that either,\u201d King said.</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t care if I look around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo nuts.\u201d</p><p>The detective grabbed the photo and stuffed it into his pocket as he turned toward me. The movement tugged his j acket and cuff up just enough to expose a livid red scrape on his forearm.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I indicated the mark.</p><p>Sullivan\u2019s lips tightened; he glanced at King, then drew me toward the front of the bar. \u201cThe other night, after I left you on Decatur, some guy jumped me on the way home.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, remembering the weird canine shadows that had seemed to follow in Sullivan\u2019s wake.</p><p>\u201cA guy?\u201d I repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He gave me an odd look. \u201cMust have been on something. He tried to bite me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he had rabies? You see a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Luckily this\u201d\u2014he lifted his hand\u2014\u201dwas from the pavement, or maybe his fingernails, which were pretty Fu Manchu. I never let his teeth get close enough to break the skin. According to the doctor, rabies is most often passed through saliva, although it can be transmitted through a scratch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened after he attacked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shot him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let the guy run off and bite someone else. Even though there\u2019s never been a documented case of human-to-human rabies infection, there\u2019s always a first time. Besides, just getting bit by a person is bad enough.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Human mouths are filthy. Any bite usually gets infected and is a definite candidate for heavy-duty antibiotics.</p><p>\u201cDid you hit him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Confusion washed over Sullivan\u2019s face. \u201cI swore I did, in the leg, even found some blood, but he ran like a j ackrabbit. There\u2019ve been no reports of gunshot wounds in any of the ERs\u2014or at least none matching this guy\u2019s description.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cYeah, although I\u2019ve seen druggies do amazing things. If they\u2019re hopped up enough, they feel no pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he did have rabies?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThat would definitely show up on the ER reports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless he died on the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been checking the John Does. So far I haven\u2019t found him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long does it take a human being to die from rabies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne to three months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I\u2019d figured once bitten, the victim would turn into a slavering monster and die pretty quickly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sullivan answered, \u201cthough once symptoms appear, death follows fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat symptoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtreme thirst but inability to drink, frothing at the mouth, confusion, convulsions.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell between us. A silence Sullivan finally broke. \u201cHave you seen Rodolfo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night.\u201d I conveniently left out how last night had extended into this morning.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Harvey?\u201d Sullivan tilted the photo toward me.</p><p>I stared at the face and tried to breathe. I shook my head and Sullivan strode toward the back door. I heard him stomping up the stairs, then across the second floor. I didn\u2019t even care that he might be going through my underwear drawer.</p><p>Go nuts, as King had said. I had more important things to worry about.</p><p>\u201cYou knew him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d King stood at my elbow.</p><p>I shook my head again and retrieved my tray, performing a last call of the remaining customers as my</p><p>mind spun.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know the man in the picture, but I had seen him.</p><p>Walking away from Rising Moon that morning with John Rodolfo. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>By the time Sullivan came downstairs empty-handed, I\u2019d regained my composure.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you find Klingman?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>His dark brown eyes contemplated me with curiosity. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t know the man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t. But\u2014\u201d I glanced around for. King, and when I didn\u2019t see him anywhere, leaned in to whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou hired me to look into the disappearances. Shouldn\u2019t I know all there is to know about the latest one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t disappear,\u201d Sullivan reiterated.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me, Conner.\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted at my use of his first name, then he shrugged. \u201cHe was found in Lake Pontchartrain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought he was on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why he wound up in the lake\u2014either trying to put himself out or it could be whoever lit him up didn\u2019t want to attract too much attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201d When was he found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon. Although he could have been floating a while. We don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of that bit of info. What had I been hoping he\u2019d say?</p><p>If Harvey had been found dead last night, would that have let Rodolfo off the hook for killing him? Not even close, since he\u2019d shown up beat to hell and gone. For all I knew, my boss had been struggling with Harvey instead of muggers.</p> <p>The thought caused me to frown. I truly doubted a blind man could kill a healthy, sighted one, start him on fire, or vice versa, then dump him in the lake. Besides, I\u2019d seen Klingman walking around after the sun came up. A fact that I should relate immediately to Detective Sullivan.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t going to.</p><p>At least not until I\u2019d talked to Rodolfo.</p><p>That proved harder to accomplish than I\u2019d imagined. Rodolfo didn\u2019t show up that night, or the next, or the next. I started to get worried, and when King didn\u2019t share my concern, I got mad.</p><p>\u201cIf he turns up dead somewhere, I guess that\u2019ll let him off the hook with Sullivan,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t turn up dead.\u201d The big man\u2019s lips twitched, which only made me madder. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s gone AWOL.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what I said. Every so often Johnny needs to get away, so he does. He always comes back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnless he\u2019s at the bottom of Lake Pontchartrain,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>King seemed certain, and since he knew Rodolfo better than I did, I figured he was right. I also figured I knew why Johnny had needed some alone time. He\u2019d wanted to get away from me.</p><p>So despite my unease, I didn\u2019t look for him. I didn\u2019t even check the third-floor room. If he ever came back, he knew exactly where to find me.</p><p>Still, I didn\u2019t sleep well. Each night I stared out my window as the moon shrank to gibbous, then a crescent, and finally disappeared altogether, leaving the sky dark but for the stars.</p><p>Downstairs, something went thud. Since King had left hours ago, the sound drew me away from my contemplation of the navy blue night. I\u2019d taken one step toward my door when a squeal from outside made me return just in time to see a squat, somewhat roly-poly shadow dart away.</p><p>\u201cThere are no pigs in New Orleans,\u201d I murmured, though I didn\u2019t know if that was true.</p><p>I peered down the alley, but nothing, no one, was there. I decided to head to the tavern for a bottle of water. It was something to do.</p><p>I\u2019d had no luck finding anyone who recognized Katie, though with the Mardi Gras festivities increasing daily, the crowds had also improved. I\u2019d stay until Lent began, and tourism understandably fell off, then I\u2019d return home.</p><p>According to the New Orleans Times-Picayune there\u2019d been no more disappearances or murders\u2014at least none without an explanation. I\u2019d spoken to Sullivan a few times, and he confirmed the same. If there was a serial killer, perhaps he was waiting for the full moon, unless he\u2019d skipped town, or been the victim of an untimely death himself.</p><p>I frowned, thinking of Harvey Klingman.</p><p>That thought flew right out of my head, as I let myself out of my room and immediately caught the scent of smoke. The same door was aj ar as before, and when I opened it I discovered the altar had reappeared.</p><p>This time I knew better than to walk away and let the thing disappear. Instead, I strode in and scooped the tiny wooden animals into my hand. The candle went out as if blown by an invisible breath.</p><p>A chill trickled over me as complete darkness descended. My eyes were wide open, yet I could see nothing. How did Rodolfo stand it?</p><p>Another thud from downstairs had me slipping the icons into the pocket of my paj ama bottoms and hurrying down the steps, silent on bare feet.</p><p>The tavern was also dark. I sensed movement in the room, though I wasn\u2019t sure where. My shin whacked into a chair; I stumbled over a table. Maybe all the movement was my own.</p><p>Still, I could have sworn I heard heavy breathing, so close my hair stirred. I paused, sweeping my arms in a circle, expecting to hit someone, maybe something, but there was nothing.</p><p>A footfall behind me, a tiny sigh ahead of me, the air swirled all around. I was disoriented, frightened, and I wished I\u2019d stayed in my room.</p><p>The back door banged open suddenly, spilling in just enough light from the distant street lamp so I could see that no one was here but me. Except how had the door come to be open?</p><p>Most likely when the altar maker left.</p><p>I crossed the short distance and slammed it shut, flipping the lock, then returning to the tavern and flicking on the lights. I shrieked as a large, man-sized figure loomed in front of me.</p><p>Tanned, blond, and buff, he could have been a surfer in one of the Annette Funicello movies Katie and I had laughed at on Saturday afternoons. Despite the youth of his face, his hair and his clothes appeared to have escaped from the fifties.</p><p>He had a flattop, something I hadn\u2019t seen out and about in years. His shorts were shorter than his hair, exposing beefy, brawny thighs. He wore a white tank top, out of which his mountainous arms swelled. I didn\u2019t know what to make of him.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d the guy demanded.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe alpha, the master, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Oh, great.</p><p>\u201cUm, could you be a little more specific?\u201d I inched toward the front door. The nutj ob followed.</p><p>\u201cHe who is supreme. The one from whom all beasts spring.\u201d He leaped across the short space between us and grabbed the neck of my paj amas, then yanked my face close to his.</p><p>His breath was rank; I didn\u2019t want to know what he\u2019d eaten last. His teeth were amazingly white and a little sharp. I leaned as far back as I could, but he only pulled me nearer and buried his nose in my hair, inhaling deeply.</p><p>He muttered something that sounded suspiciously like \u201cMother,\u201d and licked my collarbone. My skin crawled, and I brought my knee up fast and hard.</p><p>He was quicker than anyone I\u2019d ever known and whirled away before my blow found its mark. At least he let me go. His growl caused the hair on my arms to lift. I\u2019m not proud to admit it, but I ran.</p><p>I didn\u2019t get far before his fingers tangled in my hair, and he threw me to the floor. His eyes seemed to glow in the faint light, and his smile became feral. I was going to die, but probably not soon enough.</p><p>\u201cGet away from her.\u201d</p><p>The words were spoken softly, but they held an undercurrent of command. I glanced up and so did my attacker.</p><p>John Rodolfo appeared no worse for wherever he\u2019d been. He was dressed in black, his sunglasses firmly in place.</p><p>I saw no evidence of bruises on his face; the hand wrapped around his red-tipped white cane sported not a single scab. He certainly did heal fast. He moved with the innate grace I\u2019d noticed the first time I\u2019d seen him. Even blind he trod with more confidence than any man I\u2019d ever known. If he\u2019d broken a rib, I certainly couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cShe yours?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>Rodolfo set his cane against the nearest wall, took a final pull on the cigarette he held in his other hand, ground it out beneath his shoe and murmured, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to protest, then snapped it shut. I\u2019d rather be Rodolfo\u2019s than this guy\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI want her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Though I don\u2019t know how he carried anything in that small scrap of fabric he wore as shorts, the nut reached into his pocket and withdrew a long, thin metallic obj ect. He flicked his wrist, and the distinctive swish of a switchblade followed.</p><p>\u201cAre you worthy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Rodolfo\u2019s smile was equally feral. \u201cLet\u2019s find out.\u201d</p><p>I scrambled to my feet, muttering what I meant to be a denial but must have been nothing more than gibberish since the two men ignored me and rushed each other.</p><p>Panic descended. How on earth could Rodolfo fight a sighted man, let alone a crazy person with a knife?</p><p>I dived for the phone behind the bar, figuring nine-one-one was my best bet, but before I\u2019d taken two steps, I was only able to watch, fascinated.</p><p>Rodolfo ducked the first strike, j erking back from the second, which swished through the air centimeters from his nose.</p><p>Poised on the balls of his feet, head cocked as he listened intently, he became calmer as the other man became more agitated.</p><p>The beach bum thrust and parried, but he never came within an inch of Rodolfo again, though John seemed to be almost egging him on, letting him get near, then dodging away.</p><p>\u201cYou f uck,\u201d the stranger muttered, and John laughed.</p><p>The resulting howl of rage was inhuman. The man dropped to the ground on all fours, the knife skittering across the tile as he convulsed.</p><p>My inertia broke, and I dialed nine-one-one, requesting both the police and an ambulance. From the way the guy was twitching, he was going to need a pill, if not a straitj acket, and then, hopefully, a nice comfy padded cell.</p><p>As I hung up the phone, John felt around for the knife, which had slid to a stop near his feet. I didn\u2019t caution him against it, better he had the weapon than Mr. Insane-O. But as his fingers closed around the hilt, surfer dude gave a guttural cry and launched himself at Rodolfo.</p><p>Startled, John turned in his direction, and the blade sank into the man\u2019s chest to the hilt.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I blurted, then clapped my hands over my mouth.</p><p>I expected the wounded man to fall to the ground, or grab on to Rodolfo, maybe take him to the ground too. Instead he tore himself free and, with the knife still protruding grotesquely, raced for the door.</p><p>\u201d Pas argent,\u201d John muttered like a curse, then moved forward.</p><p>I stayed him with a hand on his arm. \u201cHe won\u2019t get far.\u201d</p><p>Not with a knife in his chest.</p><p>Nevertheless, I started after him myself, reaching the gaping back door just as the guy passed beneath the streetlight.</p><p>In the garish glow, I caught one glimpse of his face.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t quite human. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>I shook my head, and in that instant of movement, that tiny blink of an eye, the guy disappeared.</p><p>I stepped outside, but there was no sign of him anywhere.</p><p>Logically I knew the man couldn\u2019t just disappear.

I stepped in front of him. \u201cThe police are coming.\u201d</p><p>His face j erked toward the front of the building. \u201cYou called them? What the hell for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a guy with a knife trying to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is more than what you did for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he wasn\u2019t dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Which was just weird if you asked me. What kind of guy didn\u2019t fall down when you stabbed him in the chest?</p><p>The kind I never wanted to meet again.</p><p>\u201cYou really expected me not to call them?\u201d I asked. \u201cTo let you race after a crazy man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said he was crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sane man wouldn\u2019t run off with a knife embedded in his chest.\u201d</p><p>No, a sane man\u2014or any man for that matter-would die.</p><p>I shook off the odd thought. Of course the intruder had been a man. What else could he be?</p> <p>The true crazy person was the one in front of me who\u2019d fought a knife-wielding assailant as if he did so every day.</p><p>I wondered sometimes if Rodolfo\u2019s blindness was so recent he forgot about it and just reacted. Why else would he begin to chase a madman when he had no hope of keeping up? For that matter, why had he fought the guy in the first place?</p><p>It couldn\u2019t have been for me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not helpless,\u201d Rodolfo said softly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think that I am.\u201d</p><p>His face was somber; his eyes as unreadable behind those damn sunglasses as ever. I moved toward him, intent on removing the barriers, seeing once and for all what lay beneath.</p><p>The door burst open. \u201cPolice! Let me see your hands.\u201d</p><p>Both Rodolfo and I lifted them; unfortunately John\u2019s were covered in blood. The cops took one look and tackled him.</p><p>Half an hour later, we\u2019d ironed things out. I\u2019d managed to convince the officers to uncuff my boss. They\u2019d taken him into another room. Standard procedure for questioning.</p><p>Since there wasn\u2019t a scratch on me or on him, nor a bloody knife anywhere in the building, I think they believed our story. Problem was, the crazy guy had disappeared.</p><p>Oh, there was a blood trail, which helped, but no guy. Not anywhere in a reasonable vicinity.</p><p>\u201cHad to have been hopped up on something to run off like that with a knife in his chest,\u201d one of the officers said. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably turn up in an ER.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the morgue,\u201d answered another.</p><p>I\u2019d had this conversation before, or one very similar to it. Sullivan had shot a guy and he\u2019d run off like a j ackrabbit, never to be seen or heard from again\u2014as far as I knew.</p><p>\u201cCan one of you call Detective Sullivan?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Sullivan stepped into the bar. \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since I\u2019d known him he wasn\u2019t wearing a suit and tie but j eans with a light green button-down shirt. He appeared both comfortable and comforting. Strong, solid, sane. I wasn\u2019t attracted to him in the way he seemed to be attracted to me, but I was very glad to see him.</p><p>\u201cI heard the call on my scanner,\u201d he continued.</p><p>Some cops were never off duty. It didn\u2019t surprise me at all that Sullivan was one of them.</p><p>\u201cGot here as quick as I could,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I told him everything. Well, everything except the part where I swiped the altar icons. I\u2019d left that out of my statement earlier as well. If I wanted to discover what they meant, I couldn\u2019t do so while they were locked up in the evidence locker at the NOPD.</p><p>The police had searched me, found the icons, and not even given them a second glance. For all they knew, the tiny wooden animals were my good-luck charms. I\u2019d put them back in my pocket with no one the wiser.</p><p>They also hadn\u2019t mentioned the altar upstairs. Around here, the things were probably considered decoration.</p><p>Sullivan took my hand. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I squeezed his fingers.</p><p>A shuffle made me glance up; Rodolfo stood in the doorway. Though I knew he couldn\u2019t see us, nevertheless I snatched my hand away from Sullivan\u2019s guiltily.</p><p>\u201cDetective,\u201d Rodolfo greeted.</p><p>My eyebrows shot up. How did he do that? Probably wasn\u2019t as big of a mystery as I thought. He\u2019d no doubt heard Sullivan and me speaking even in the other room.</p><p>\u201cDid anyone tell you I\u2019ve been asking for you?\u201d Sullivan glanced at me.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cHe just got back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom where?\u201d</p><p>Rodolfo tilted his head, staring slightly to the right of Sullivan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAm I under arrest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Rodolfo smiled and the expression, without benefit of the eyes, was not a friendly one. \u201cThen I don\u2019t believe I have to tell you where I\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>Even I thought that sounded guilty.</p><p>\u201cThere have been disappearances,\u201d I began.</p><p>Rodolfo\u2019s mirrored gaze turned in my direction. \u201cWhat do you know about them?\u201d</p><p>Sullivan and I exchanged glances.</p><p>Whoops.</p><p>\u201cAnne was here when I came in to ask about a man. Show his picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t know him. Neither did your cohort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to help you, Detective, but I won\u2019t be any good with pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name was Harvey Klingman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas?\u201d</p><p>Sullivan\u2019s sigh was impatient. \u201cHe was found in Lake Pontchartrain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople drown, Detective. I don\u2019t understand why Homicide is involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the man didn\u2019t drown. There was the small matter of being set on fire before he wound up in the lake.\u201d</p><p>Rodolfo was good. If I hadn\u2019t been studying him, I wouldn\u2019t have seen the flicker of emotion cross his face. I wasn\u2019t sure what it had been. Unease? Shock? Guilt? Whatever it was, I don\u2019t think Sullivan noticed.</p><p>\u201cSet on fire,\u201d Rodolfo repeated. \u201cSeems a little extreme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re trying to hide something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an open book, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a regular fountain of helpful info, that\u2019s you,\u201d Sullivan muttered.</p><p>\u201cIf I knew anything that would help, I\u2019d tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know Harvey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was a bald-faced lie. Or was it?</p><p>I\u2019d seen them together, but who was to say Harvey hadn\u2019t given a false name, or perhaps not given his name at all? Maybe he\u2019d merely been accompanying a blind man down the street, or telling John how much he enj oyed his music, then they\u2019d parted company a few blocks over, and Harvey had gone on to meet his horrific and untimely demise.</p><p>If so, then telling Sullivan Rodolfo had been in the company of a dead man only hours before he became dead would ensure a trip to the slammer for my boss. I didn\u2019t want that.</p><p>I\u2019d kept my counsel to give Rodolfo the benefit of the doubt. I planned to talk to him first, in private, about Harvey Klingman.</p><p>Time enough to tell Sullivan later, if there was anything to tell. Harvey wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Or at least I hoped he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI have several witnesses who saw Klingman at Rising Moon the night before he disappeared,\u201d Sullivan said.</p><p>\u201cThis is the same tune, different verse, Detective, and just like those other times, with other people, I never saw them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never see anyone. Which is damn convenient if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>I gasped at the rudeness. Sullivan gave me a glare; Rodolfo merely smiled.</p><p>\u201cIf you think this is convenient\u201d\u2014Rodolfo flicked a finger at his glasses\u2014\u201dyou aren\u2019t as bright as I thought you were, Conner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you aren\u2019t half as smart as you think you are, John. There\u2019s something about you that nags at me, and I\u2019m going to find out what it is.\u201d With a nod in my direction, Sullivan left. The rest of the officers followed.</p><p>I waited until the door clicked shut behind them before I spoke. \u201cI saw you with him.\u201d</p><p>Rodolfo didn\u2019t bother to pretend he didn\u2019t know which \u201chim\u201d I referred to. He crossed the short distance between us and grabbed me by the forearms, yanking me onto my toes. \u201cYou think I\u2019m a murderer, chica?\u201d</p><p>I meant to say no, but what came out instead was, \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened to an almost painful degree, but I refused to glance away, even though I could read nothing from his hidden gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t know any Harvey. I met a man leaving Rising Moon this morning and we walked together for a bit. He was pleasant. I enj oyed the conversation. I assume that was him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell Sullivan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know until you told me that the kind gentleman and the dead gentleman were one and the same.\u201d</p><p>Huh. He was right.</p><p>\u201cHow can you think I\u2019m a murderer after we\u2019ve been as close as two people can be?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe had sex, John. We weren\u2019t close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we never will be.\u201d</p><p>The despair in his voice made my throat thicken. Despite his darkness, his silence, his mystery, there was still an aura of need surrounding him that called to me. Was I using him to fill the empty place that was Katie? She\u2019d needed me; I\u2019d failed, so did I subconsciously hope to atone for my mistake with Rodolfo?</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>What I was sure of was that having him need me, wanting him to, was a very dangerous thing to want.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can expect us to have anything other than an occasional bump in the night,\u201d I snapped, \u201cwhen you lie at every opportunity.\u201d</p><p>He leaned into me, rubbing his cheek against my hair, brushing his lips across my temple, even as he continued to hold on to me so tightly I had no doubt I\u2019d have a bruise come tomorrow. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>he murmured.</p><p>I stiffened. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say you\u2019re searching for your sister.\u201d</p><p>I pulled back, but he didn\u2019t let me go. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mention that you\u2019re a private investigator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou checked me out?\u201d I don\u2019t know why that annoyed me. Sullivan had done the same thing and I\u2019d barely blinked.</p><p>\u201cI may not be as smart as I think I am, but I\u2019m definitely not as dumb as I look. You thought I\u2019d let you work here, sleep here, and not make sure you aren\u2019t an extremely attractive escaped lunatic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d I broke off before I said \u201cblind.\u201d Instead I muttered, \u201cI\u2019m not attractive,\u201d horrified to discover I suddenly wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cPretty is as pretty does,\u201d he said, and I wasn\u2019t sure if that was an insult or a compliment. Lying wasn\u2019t very pretty.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>Rodolfo smiled down at me. \u201cWell, I never said I wasn\u2019t an escaped lunatic.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>His hold gentled, his thumbs rubbing the insides of my arms so that I shivered. What was it about this man that made me behave completely out of character, had me doing things I knew were a bad idea, yet I couldn\u2019t bring myself to stop?</p><p>It couldn\u2019t just be his face, the body, that voice\u2014which slid silkily from foreign endearments to guttural Anglo-Saxon curses, the accent here, there, gone again, never strong enough to figure out what, or even if, it was.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t be the sex either\u2014though that had been spectacular\u2014because I\u2019d been fascinated with him long before he\u2019d ever touched me.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t the kind of woman who fell in love at first sight\u2014nor was I the kind to believe this was love. I was too practical for that.</p><p>What it was, was something that both scared and thrilled me, something I couldn\u2019t give up. At least not yet.</p><p>His palms cupped my hips. The pulse of his arousal pressed into my belly, and I shimmied against him.</p><p>He groaned and stepped back, putting out a hand to stop me when I followed. \u201cWe can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can. Did. Will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnne, I\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m no good at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. You\u2019re very good.\u201d</p><p>Most men would have been flattered. Of course, most men wouldn\u2019t be inching slowly away from a woman who wanted them.</p><p>He shoved a hand through his hair, then let it drop back to his side. \u201cI meant you and I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan,\u201d I argued.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m not...\u201d His voice trailed off.</p> <p>\u201cNot what, John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. I\u2019m not good for anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me get to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why that hurt. I didn\u2019t plan to stay; I doubted he\u2019d go. This wasn\u2019t a love affair, and I didn\u2019t want it to be.</p><p>I\u2019d made a promise\u2014to myself, if not Katie\u2014that I wouldn\u2019t move on with my life until I got hers back. I couldn\u2019t throw that promise to the wind and make a future with this man, even if he asked me to.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, horrified when my voice shook. I stopped, cleared my throat and lifted my chin, staring straight into his... sunglasses. \u201cWe won\u2019t date. We\u2019ll just fuck.\u201d</p><p>The word tasted nasty on my tongue, but he\u2019d hurt me and I wanted to hurt him back.</p><p>He muttered something in Spanish, but he didn\u2019t appear shocked or upset. All the anger went out of me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about\u2014\u201d I broke off, uncertain how to broach the subj ect.</p><p>His head tilted. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do, chica, very much.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand how he could say I was attractive, that he worried about me, then turn away the offer of my body. I knew I\u2019d never model for Vogue or Victoria\u2019s Secret, but he didn\u2019t. Had I been that bad in bed?</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I\u2019m not accomplished like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d he asked warily.</p><p>\u201cNo one in particular. I\u2019m sure the women you usually\u2014\u201d I waved my hand, then realized he couldn\u2019t see me. \u201cUm, sleep with, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re spectacular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I sleep with so many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you? The first night you thought I\u2019d searched you out for sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t sleep with just anyone.\u201d</p><p>My head came up. I wished for the hundredth time that I could see his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t been with a woman for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve happiness.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to say. How many times had I thought the same thing?</p><p>\u201cEveryone deserves happiness,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cThey do not.\u201d</p><p>Since I agreed with him, I quit arguing and brought up the concern that had troubled me since we\u2019d fallen all over each other. \u201cYou seemed upset the other night, after we\u2014You know.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slightly. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d I repeated. His smile dissolved into confusion. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, on the pill,\u201d I finished quickly.</p><p>I hated this conversation.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I was worried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any weird diseases either.\u201d I bulldozed onward. \u201cI\u2019ve never...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d he murmured, with a quirk of one dark eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWell, not never. I wasn\u2019t a virgin.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something I couldn\u2019t make out, and I decided I didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been with anyone who hasn\u2019t used a condom,\u201d I blurted.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Understanding dawned. \u201cThe modern plagues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard the theory that the sexually transmitted diseases of this age are the Black Death of the old?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Fraid not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to worry about me either. I was examined quite thoroughly when this\u201d\u2014he pointed to his eyes\u2014\u201dhappened. Nothing wrong with me that a little eyesight couldn\u2019t cure. I haven\u2019t touched anyone since.\u201d</p><p>A tingle of unease began at the base of my spine. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver a year now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had sex in a year,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders sagged. No wonder he\u2019d kissed me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019d think that news would make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Of course.\u201d I laughed, the sound too loud in the sudden stillness. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled. But if you weren\u2019t worried about birth control or STDs then why were you so upset the other night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He lifted his hand as if he planned to touch my cheek, then lowered it and turned away. \u201cI thought I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me complaining?\u201d</p><p>He remained silent.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you had, I\u2019d tell you. If you do, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life, it hasn\u2019t been normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201d Chica, your life was so normal, it positively glowed.\u201d His sigh was long and sad and full of things I didn\u2019t understand. \u201cUntil three years ago.\u201d</p><p>Now I remained silent, because he was right.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to give up?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cNot until I know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth can be an ugly thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least we\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she\u2019s worse than dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse?\u201d</p><p>He turned, and the lights reflected off his sunglasses so brightly I flinched. For an instant the glowing white orbs had looked like eyes. In a horror flick.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, there are things much worse than death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you talk to yourself? Why you have headaches? Nightmares? Why you won\u2019t let anyone close? Because of things that are worse than death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you talked about it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Listen to my nightmares, kiss me and make them all go away? You can\u2019t. No one can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly what I deserved.\u201d</p><p>A sudden, shrill howling split the night. \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d I headed for the door.</p><p>His hand shot out, and he grabbed my arm\u2014a pretty good catch for a blind man\u2014then held on when I would have pulled away.</p><p>I opened my mouth to ask if he heard the howl, if he knew what it was, and he kissed me.</p><p>I tasted desperation on his lips, and I wasn\u2019t sure why. Was he as desperate for the taste of me as I was for a taste of him? I doubted it. He\u2019d managed to convince me that the two of us together wasn\u2019t a good idea. I\u2019d believed him when he\u2019d said we couldn\u2019t do this.</p><p>So why were we?</p><p>I didn\u2019t know and, right now, I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Mouth on mine, tongues at war, he walked me backward until my shoulders met the wall. An instant later, the lights went out.</p><p>I wondered momentarily what difference it made, then realized that with the lights glaring and the big window up front, anyone passing on the street would get a peep show worthy of Bourbon.</p><p>In truth, I liked the darkness. That glimpse of the lights reflected in Rodolfo\u2019s sunglasses had spooked me, and I didn\u2019t want to see it again. Especially now.</p><p>His body pressed the length of mine; he crowded me against the wall. I arched, moaning as his erection settled more firmly between my thighs.</p><p>Hands under my shirt, he filled them with my breasts, unfettered in the night. His fingers were so long and supple. With a musician\u2019s talent for coaxing music out of ivory and metal, he\u2019d have no trouble coaxing everything out of me.</p><p>I could have sworn I heard that howl again, but when I broke the kiss, turning my attention toward the window, he swung me onto the bar in one swift movement, yanking my paj ama bottoms to my ankles along with my panties, and I forgot about everything that wasn\u2019t in the room with me right now.</p><p>Perched on the edge of the cherrywood structure, I was several inches above where I needed to be. Or so I thought. When I tried to scoot off, to pull him upstairs, or maybe to the nearest table, he stopped me with a hand on my chest. \u201cLay back.\u201d</p><p>I resisted, but not for long, as his other hand dipped between my legs.</p><p>The bar was long and wide, not exactly comfortable on my spine, but I didn\u2019t care once his head descended.</p><p>His lips were as clever as his fingers; I felt like an instrument being persuaded to make music it had never before been capable of.</p><p>The tip of his tongue found the tight bud between my legs. How could a tongue be hard and soft, seductive and at the same time demanding?</p><p>My neck arched; I caught a glimpse of us in the mirrored wall behind the bar, his dark head framed by my thighs, pale in the slight drift of the distant streetlight through the window.</p><p>The picture as erotic as the sensations, I cried out, so near the edge I quivered with it. He pulled away, lifting me from the bar and depositing me on the nearest table. I had an instant where I felt like lunch as he gazed down at me, the black holes of his glasses familiar yet disturbing.</p><p>Then his loose trousers pooled at his ankles, and he pushed into me, stretching, filling, making what was empty full, what was two suddenly one, and the loneliness that lived inside of me receded.</p><p>I wrapped my legs around his hips, my arms around his neck. I was going to have a bruised backside in a few hours, but that seemed a small price to pay.</p><p>He slowed things down, his strokes deeper, longer, more deliberate. His clever hands traced my breasts, my belly, my nipples, as if memorizing their shape and texture.</p><p>When his fingers lifted to my face, I was tempted to deny him. Would he be able to tell I wasn\u2019t a pretty girl just by touch? Would it matter?</p><p>Except he whispered my name, and I couldn\u2019t tell him no to that any more than I\u2019d been able to tell him no to anything else.</p><p>He murmured words in several languages, his body moving in and out of mine as his fingertips traced my cheekbones, my j awline, the bridge of my nose. The latter made him smile and press his mouth to the crooked bone.</p><p>\u201cDid someone hurt you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>In that instant, I knew he was going to, worse than anyone else ever had.</p><p>I tried to shake off the weird premonition. I wasn\u2019t a woman who believed in such things.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was an accident, in a basketball game.\u201d</p><p>Speaking of how I\u2019d broken my nose, taking an elbow on a rebound, made the last shiver of superstition die away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so...\u201d His voice trailed off and I tensed. Did he know I was plain?</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d he finished, and an unladylike snort escaped.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPeople have called me many things,\u201d I said, \u201cbut \u2018amazing\u2019 doesn\u2019t happen to be one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen most people are more blind than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re seeing things that aren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, seeming to look right at me, despite the barrier of the ever-present sunglasses. \u201cI</p><p>see better than you think.\u201d</p><p>I certainly hoped that wasn\u2019t true.</p><p>Unwilling to continue talking, I began to move against him, and his face tightened as did his body.</p><p>I came gasping his name, even as he gasped mine, the two words somehow more intimate than the actions that had preceded them.</p><p>The orgasm rolled through us both, his fueling mine and mine his, the sensations drawing out, seeming to become more intense rather than less.</p><p>When the final convulsion faded, he collapsed, his sweat-slicked skin sliding along my own.</p><p>I must have fallen asleep. That was the only explanation for what happened next. I sensed a shadow drift past the window, and I opened my eyes.</p><p>Staring through the glass was the biggest wolf I\u2019d ever seen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Not that I\u2019d ever seen one, except in a zoo. But those animals had always been scraggly, skinny, domesticated. This one wasn\u2019t.</p><p>The beast was big and pretty damn scary with its lips curled back and its fangs dripping saliva. The fur appeared light\u2014white or perhaps gold\u2014although I couldn\u2019t tell if that were the actual color or merely a reflection of the streetlight. I didn\u2019t remember ever seeing a white wolf.</p><p>That was my first clue that maybe the wolf wasn\u2019t real, even before I noticed the eyes. They were too damn human.</p> <p>My own snapped open. How had they gotten shut?</p><p>I turned my head and stared at the gray light of dawn creeping through the suddenly empty front window.</p><p>Rodolfo was nuzzling my neck, and my body ached everywhere.</p><p>I almost blurted, \u201cDid you see it?\u201d but managed to stop before I said something so foolish.</p><p>\u201cAnne?\u201d He straightened, bending to pull up his pants. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Mine had fallen off somewhere between the bar and the table. I retrieved them, yanking the paj ama bottoms onto my legs as I continued to stare at the empty window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He thrust his fingers through his hair. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>My mind, finally clearing of the last tendrils of sexual satisfaction, began to question, and my mouth followed suit. \u201cWhy did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t seem to help myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sex for a year will do that.\u201d I headed for the stairs.</p><p>He snatched my arm and held on. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the reason.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo? It certainly isn\u2019t the way I look, the shape of my ass, the size of my breasts, or even my charming personality.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted. \u201cYou don\u2019t know, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow truly beautiful you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Prom queen material. That\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>He stepped in close and ran his fingers lightly over my cheeks, my nose, my chin. I froze, unable to run away even though I should.</p><p>\u201cThis face has character. It\u2019s been lived in. Seen things, loved someone. That\u2019s more attractive than perfection could ever be.\u201d</p><p>A fingertip lingered on my lips. My body responded again to his, and I closed my eyes, fighting for a control that with this man seemed lost. Had he cast a spell on me?</p> <p>I stepped away from his touch so I could think straight. Because to have been entertaining the idea of a love spell inside a building that was supposedly cursed, after I\u2019d seen a wolf that couldn\u2019t exist, was definitely not clearheaded.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I managed, and I meant it. No one had ever told me I was beautiful before. Considering the first was a blind, self-admitted head case, I liked it more than I ought to.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go home,\u201d he murmured. \u201cTo Philadelphia.\u201d</p><p>My heart gave one hard thud. \u201cYou want me gone?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, then let it out. \u201cNo. But it would be best if you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest for who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, chica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I said, and I would. Though I doubted very much I would go.</p><p>\u201cYou need sleep,\u201d he said.</p><p>I did, so I headed for the stairs, hesitating when he didn\u2019t follow. \u201cJohn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. I want to check on a few things.\u201d</p><p>I could understand that. The police had been everywhere.</p><p>I went to my room and lay down on the bed just as the door closed downstairs. I blinked a few times before vaulting up and racing across the floor to peer out the window.</p><p>The only thing I saw was a black cat darting across the street.</p><p>John must still be downstairs; maybe he\u2019d put the cat out. That made sense.</p><p>But the sight of the animal reminded me of the carvings that were amazingly still in my pocket. I should show them to John, let him touch the wooden shapes, see if he noticed something I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>I went back into the tavern, but John was gone, which was just plain strange. How had he managed to disappear in the time it had taken me to get down there? For a blind man, he was unbelievably quick.</p><p>I checked the rest of the building. No John. No altar either. The thing had disappeared as if it had never been. Maybe that was why the police hadn\u2019t mentioned it. The altar hadn\u2019t been there by the time they arrived.</p><p>In my room I set the carvings on the nightstand. A cat. A pig. A chicken and a\u2014</p><p>My eyes narrowed and I leaned in close. What I\u2019d first thought to be a dog didn\u2019t look like a dog any longer. Was that only because I was paranoid, or was the carving actually that of a wolf?</p><p>The note taped to the front door of the voodoo shop informed all callers that the priestess was out of town until after Mardi Gras. There were business hours posted, but they were only for the retail establishment.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t say I blamed Cassandra for decamping. New Orleans was slowly going mad. With only a week left until Fat Tuesday, there were Mardi Gras parades galore. Hosted by private clubs known as</p><p>\u201ckrewes,\u201d up to sixty-five extravaganzas might march through the city each season. Though none of them went through the French Quarter, the streets being too narrow, there was plenty going on there without them.</p><p>I stuck my hands in my pockets and j angled the icons. I didn\u2019t want to wait until after Mardi Gras to discover what they meant, so I headed from the voodoo shop on Royal Street to the cafe on Chartres.</p><p>Maybe Maggie knew another voodoo priestess who could help.</p><p>Maggie\u2019s face brightened when she saw me. \u201cI was going to call you when I got off. I did some research on those animal totems.\u201d</p><p>My stomach did a weird little dance, almost like d\u00e9j \u00e0 vu. \u201cQuite the coincidence that I showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn voodoo we believe there are no accidents,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cYou came because you needed the information I can give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just happened to be here?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m always here. At least every morning at five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time I came, you said you\u2019d never heard of icons on altars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because my studies were pretty general, and icons like the ones you described are quite specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have time for a break?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Maggie checked her watch. \u201cI\u2019m about due.\u201d</p><p>She filled my order, then grabbed a cup of coffee for herself and led me to a table outside. The day was overcast, muggy, despite a lingering chill to the air.</p><p>I\u2019d dug out the single pair of j eans my parents had sent, along with my favorite Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt. I kept hoping that if I wore the shirt long enough, they wouldn\u2019t choke. However, I was starting to think the material would disintegrate from repeated washings long before the Eagles won a Super Bowl.</p><p>I pulled the icons out of my pocket and set them on the table. She stared at them for several seconds, chewing her lip.</p><p>\u201cThis is such bad moj o,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014who?\u201d</p><p>Maggie lifted her gaze. \u201cMoj o. Black magic. Which is why I didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d</p><p>My stomach did the dance again, and I doused the tickle with coffee. \u201cYou\u2019d better explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoodoo is a religion of peace, understanding, inclusion. It\u2019s about gentleness and love, not violence and hate.\u201d Her smile became sad. \u201cWhich is why I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that. But why didn\u2019t you know about the black magic side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery houngan, or voodoo priest, has his own community, his own rules and rituals. But a houngan or a mambo, a priestess, only practices the light side. The dark side is known but never visited.\u201d She brushed her finger across the wolf icon, then yanked it back as if she\u2019d been burned. \u201cOnly a bokor, an evil priest, would do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a legend in voodoo, of a shapeshifting sorcerer. This shapeshifter can take any form\u2014horse, wolf, cat, pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does the sorcerer do once he changes form?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe legend says he wanders the night, drinking the blood of children.\u201d</p><p>I flinched. \u201cSo he\u2019s both a werewolf and a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA were-something and a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the legend have any theories as to why someone would want to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome say the sorcerer is cursed by the spirits. A bokor gains his power from the loas. He buys the magic at great cost, most often a life. If the bokor backs out of his promise, the loas might in turn curse him to become a shapeshifter. There are also those who feel such power is inherited and some who think it comes only after great illness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand what a person would gain from being a shapeshifter.\u201d</p><p>Not that I was buying any of this. But I had a feeling someone was.</p><p>\u201cImmortality?\u201d Maggie suggested. \u201cI think werewolves are pretty hard to kill. I would assume were- cats, were-pigs, were-chickens aren\u2019t any easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy ,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re saying someone made an altar, set these icons on it, then changed</p><p>into...\u201d</p><p>I waved my hand at the figures.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s hard to believe, and I\u2019m not saying I do. I\u2019m just telling you what I found out when I went searching for totemlike animals and a voodoo altar. I also found quite a bit of information on different Native American tribes who use totems to represent their spirit animal. Many believe their essence is contained in those icons, and they merge beneath the moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were discussing voodoo; now you\u2019re bringing up Native Americans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just pointing out that many different cultures and religions have transformation legends. The Navaj o believe certain shamans can don the skin of an animal and become one. They\u2019re known as skinwalkers, both witch and werewolf.\u201d</p><p>My head spun with all the information.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve noticed any strange animals lurking around under the moon?\u201d Maggie smiled when she said it but I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>I\u2019d thought the wolf in the window a dream, but what about the black cat in the stairwell and on the street</p><p>\u2014a cat I\u2019d only seen at night, after first finding the altar?</p><p>My eyes flicked to the pig and I heard again the squeal, saw the potbellied shadow darting across the alley behind Rising Moon.</p><p>I shook my head; Maggie took that as an answer and continued. \u201cSomeone is probably just trying out a spell they read on the Internet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they turned into a lougaro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d I managed.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, a voodoo werewolf.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I was having a hard time breathing. Sullivan had intimated that someone who thought he was a werewolf was killing people.</p><p>But what if someone who actually was a werewolf was killing people? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>My laughter was slightly hysterical, which just wasn\u2019t like me. I forced myself to stop, take a sip of coffee and several deep breaths.</p><p>Just because there\u2019d been an altar with icons that might or might not be a voodoo spell to transform a person into a wolf\u2014or a cat, or a pig, or a chicken\u2014didn\u2019t mean it had happened. I knew better.</p><p>\u201cI have to go back to work,\u201d Maggie said.</p> <p>I nodded, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cThese are just legends,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere is magic in the world; I believe that, but not this kind of magic.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m letting myself get spooked by this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew Orleans will do that. Most haunted city in America, they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwell,\u201d I muttered, and she grinned.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have any more questions, you know where to find me.\u201d She leaned over and wrote a www. address on one of the napkins. \u201cHere\u2019s the Web site where I got most of the info. You can always try there first. There\u2019s even an e-mail address to ask questions. It\u2019s very helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d She left me alone in the courtyard.</p><p>Now what?</p><p>Someone with access to Rising Moon thought they were a lougaro, or at the least thought they could become one. People were disappearing or winding up dead after visiting the place. Were the two connected?</p><p>As Maggie said, \u201cThere are no accidents.\u201d I didn\u2019t think this was one either.</p> <p>I should probably tell Sullivan, except what, exactly, would I tell him? He wasn\u2019t going to believe the shapeshifter theory any more than I did.</p><p>As I exited the coffee shop, I tossed the icons into the nearest trash bin. Maybe that would help.</p><p>Though, somehow, I doubted it.</p><p>A few days later I was doing my best to catch some sleep before my shift and having very little luck. I tossed; I turned. My pillow felt all lumpy.</p><p>When I lifted it, another small bag of tangy-scented herbs rested beneath.</p><p>Who kept doing this? I didn\u2019t care for the idea that someone had been in my room and touched my pillow. What else had they touched?</p><p>I set the thing on my nightstand, determined to ask King about it. I\u2019d also request a change of locks on both the club and my bedroom door. Seemed like anyone could waltz in here at any time and do just about anything. Yet no one ever saw them.</p><p>And why was that?</p> <p>\u201cGhosts,\u201d I muttered, remembering Sullivan\u2019s admonition that this place, and many others in town, were haunted. However, I didn\u2019t believe in ghosts either.</p><p>Without the proverbial pea beneath the princess, I slept, waking at the first note of the piano downstairs.</p><p>All around me the blue velvet darkness swirled.</p><p>I let the smooth tones soothe me. I didn\u2019t have to be downstairs for an hour and right now the appeal of just drifting was too strong to be denied. I hadn\u2019t liked j azz when I\u2019d arrived, but the more I heard, the more I learned, the more it grew on me.</p><p>I slid away on the music, floating between the two worlds, not awake, not asleep, both hyper-aware and zoned out at the same time.</p><p>Suddenly my eyes snapped open. Had that been the door closing? Someone leaving, someone coming, or nothing at all?</p><p>\u201cJohn?\u201d</p><p>No one answered. Cold sweat tickled my pores. I wished, not for the first time, that I\u2019d brought my gun to New Orleans.</p><p>Annoyed at my fear, sick and tired of cowering, I flicked on the lamp, leaving my hand around the base, prepared to throw the thing at someone\u2019s head if I had to.</p><p>But no one was there.</p><p>I gave a little laugh, which sounded more like a nervous cough. How did John stand the darkness? The uncertainty? The fear?</p><p>Except he never seemed uncertain or fearful. The longer I knew him, the more amazing he became.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until I\u2019d taken a shower, dressed for work, then returned to the nightstand to grab the bag of herbs that I saw the white handkerchief. Since I didn\u2019t own a white handkerchief, I was understandably distressed.</p><p>Even more so when it became apparent the material was wrapped around something. I should probably call the police, but I\u2019d never been very good at waiting.</p><p>I tugged on the handkerchief, wincing as it pulled free. I don\u2019t know what I expected\u2014a severed finger, a toe, perhaps an eyeball. Too many horror movies during my teen years, no doubt.</p><p>However, what spilled out of the white cotton and thunked against the surface of the nightstand had me hyperventilating worse than any of those other horrific items would have.</p><p>Because the sterling silver bracelet was Katie\u2019s.</p><p>She\u2019d been wearing it the night she disappeared. I remembered because we\u2019d fought over the thing.</p><p>The last words she\u2019d said to me had been, \u201cYou can wear this bracelet when I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p><p>And being a sister, I\u2019d said, \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d flounced out of the house, and I hadn\u2019t seen her or the bracelet again.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>My fingers trembled as they reached out. I was centimeters away from picking up the silver band when I saw the blood, the dirt, and snatched them away.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I whispered. Was that Katie\u2019s blood? If so, then who had brought the bracelet here?</p><p>I wrapped my arms around myself as a chill overtook me. Who had been in my room? When? Did it matter? I had another lead in a case that had been as cold as a January morning, even with the picture of Katie on the street outside this building. I\u2019d take whatever clues I could get and run with them.</p><p>Wrapping the bracelet in the handkerchief, I glanced around the room for someplace to hide it until I could get the thing analyzed.</p><p>Maybe here wasn\u2019t the best idea. People seemed to come in and out at will. Instead, I sneaked into the hall, then into a spare bedroom, glancing about uneasily for another altar, thrilled when I didn\u2019t find one. I tucked the shrouded silver beneath the mattress, then returned to my room and dialed Sullivan.</p><p>I got voice mail. Never could find a cop when you needed one.</p><p>At the beep, I left a message. \u201cI need something analyzed. Can you come to Rising Moon when you get a chance? I\u2019m working tonight.\u201d</p><p>I ran down the steps and nearly slammed into a customer when I entered the tavern. From the size of the crowd, if not the skill of the music, I deduced John was at the piano, even before I glanced over and saw that I was right.</p><p>King scowled in my direction. I was late and we were busy. The next several hours passed in a blur of drink orders, laughter, and song.</p><p>Rodolfo was in rare form, playing continuously, seemingly inexhaustible, almost rabid in his intensity. I found myself anticipating the end of my shift. Would we climb the steps to my room and be together?</p><p>Thinking of him kept my mind off Katie and her bracelet, kept me from wondering, too often, what it meant. But it didn\u2019t keep me from watching the door, starting whenever it opened, then sighing in disappointment when Sullivan didn\u2019t walk through.</p><p>At last, long past midnight, John rose from the piano, and despite numerous urgings to the contrary, refused to go back, disappearing instead into the office and closing the door. The crowd began to thin immediately, giving me a chance to talk to King.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d I laid the slightly crunchy bag of who knows what on the bar.</p><p>King glanced up in the middle of pouring Wild Turkey into a shot glass, and the liquor squirted wildly across the previously pristine bar.</p><p>I snatched the tiny bag out of harm\u2019s way. \u201cHey!\u201d He glanced furtively around. \u201cYou keep that thing out of sight,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t quite the reaction I\u2019d expected, but at least he appeared to know something. I tucked it into my pocket, then waited as patiently as I could for him to complete the order.</p><p>He motioned me to the end of the bar. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder my pillow\u2014for the second time this week.\u201d His perpetual frown deepened. \u201cMakes no sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was some New Orleans tradition. Like potpourri.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s a gris-gris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoodoo?\u201d</p><p>King nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be protection, a curse, or even a love charm.\u201d</p><p>Love charm? Hell.</p><p>I removed the bag from my pocket and held it out. \u201cWhat about this one?\u201d</p><p>He stared at the gris-gris for an instant. \u201cI told you before, I don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about voodoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would put this under my pillow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know nothin\u2019 \u2018bout that either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we need to change the locks on this place.\u201d</p><p>King\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d I turned, determined to finish my shift and hunt down Sullivan, then paused at the sight of John leaning in the doorway to the office. His dark glasses shone starkly against his overly pale face.</p><p>I started toward him, planning to ask him a few questions, but he backed away, lifting a shaking hand to his head. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he muttered. I paused. \u201cYou have a migraine?\u201d He nodded, winced at the motion, then took several quick steps in retreat, before shutting the door in my face. I was tempted to follow, but what could I do? From past experience with my mother, I\u2019d learned a migraine sufferer was better left alone, in the dark. \u201cAnne,\u201d King called. \u201cA little help here.\u201d Rising Moon had started to fill up again. Some locals drifted in, started to play, and we got even busier. Mardi Gras was almost upon us.</p><p>I ended up running for another two hours and forgetting, for the most part, about magic charms and John Rodolfo. Around three a.m., Sullivan strode in. \u201cYou got my message,\u201d I said. That stopped him. \u201cWhat message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t get it, then why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to call; no one answered.\u201d I indicated the band, then the crowd. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. What did you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour boss has been arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I glanced toward the rear of Rising Moon. \u201cHe\u2019s in the office. With a migraine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was found standing over a murdered woman, and he says he doesn\u2019t remember how he got there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we take a look?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and led the way. Certainly Rodolfo could have left the office and slipped out the back door.</p><p>But if he\u2019d had a migraine, I doubted he\u2019d gone far. Of course, he\u2019d only said he had one. He could have been lying.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell you doin\u2019 here?\u201d King demanded.</p><p>\u201cOfficial business,\u201d Sullivan answered. \u201cShe says your boss is in the office; I say he\u2019s locked up for murder.\u201d</p><p>King moved swiftly, twisting the key on the register, then hurrying out from behind the bar, wiping his hands on a towel as he went. He paused at the microphone, yanking it rudely away from the young woman who was singing a very nice rendition of \u201cSentimental Journey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody out,\u201d he ordered. \u201cWe closed.\u201d</p><p>People began to complain, but King drew himself up to his full height, flexed his impressive biceps beneath the smooth cotton of his white T-shirt, and scowled. Everybody got out.</p><p>\u201cDid you see John leave?\u201d I asked, following King toward the back of the club.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d King\u2019s gaze turned to Sullivan. \u201cYou see Johnny yourself?\u201d</p><p>Sullivan\u2019s confidence wavered a bit. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot him then. It\u2019s an easy thing to give another man\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>The weight on my chest lightened. That was it. The man behind bars wasn\u2019t John, but someone who\u2019d seen him play, remembered his name, then used it at an inopportune time. Sullivan had just jumped the gun.</p><p>I opened the door to the office. \u201cJohn?\u201d I murmured. \u201cYou here?\u201d</p><p>Silence was my only answer. I hated to turn on the harsh overhead lights, though really, what would it matter? I didn\u2019t get a chance to decide. Sullivan flicked the switch.</p><p>I flinched in the glare, then stared at an empty room.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Sullivan said, \u201cwhich one of you wants to come with me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\u201cWhy you need one of us?\u201d King demanded. \u201cYou got your mind all made up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRodolfo needs a lawyer, but he won\u2019t call one. Says he\u2019s innocent. Insisted that his one phone call be made here, and since no one answered...\u201d Sullivan spread his hands.</p><p>\u201cSuch service,\u201d King murmured, eyes on me. \u201cYou\u2019d think you had another reason for coming to Rising Moon altogether.\u201d</p> <p>The detective\u2019s cheeks got a little red.</p><p>King gave a derisive laugh. \u201cYou go along, Anne. Talk some sense into Johnny while I finish up.\u201d</p><p>I continued to stare at the empty office. I was starting to wonder if Rising Moon had secret passageways I wasn\u2019t aware of.</p><p>\u201cSense?\u201d I repeated. \u201cHow will I manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo your best.\u201d King shrugged. \u201cIf you need bail money, call me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be bail on a murder case,\u201d Sullivan stated.</p><p>King moved unbelievably fast for such a big man, crossing the short distance separating him from the detective in a fraction of time and pausing only centimeters away from bumping chests. \u201cJohnny. Don\u2019t.</p><p>Murder. People.\u201d</p><p>Each word was low, intense, clipped. Sullivan\u2019s fingers clenched, and I wondered what I\u2019d do if they decided to go round and round. There was no way I\u2019d be able to stop them. I doubted anyone could.</p><p>Then I\u2019d have to bail King out of j ail, even if I couldn\u2019t do the same for Rodolfo.</p><p>Luckily, once he\u2019d made his point, King went back to work without saying another word.</p> <p>\u201cHe seems pretty certain,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to have to be a lot more than certain to get your boss out of this.\u201d</p><p>I faced Sullivan. \u201cYou aren\u2019t very obj ective on the subj ect of John Rodolfo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a feeling.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s something not right about the guy.\u201d</p><p>Far be it from me to argue with a cop\u2019s hunch. Besides, he\u2019d need more than that to charge Rodolfo with murder and make it stick.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you call me?\u201d At my puzzled look, he continued, \u201cYou said you left a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Katie \u2019s bracelet. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>I ran upstairs, retrieved the item, then returned, beckoning Sullivan outside, where I placed the package in his hand. \u201cSomeone left this on my nightstand today.\u201d</p> <p>He opened the white handkerchief, frowned and glanced up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Katie\u2019s,\u201d I said.</p><p>His eyes widened, before he nodded and pocketed the thing. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan had parked his car, a navy blue Crown Victoria, at the curb out front. We climbed in and buckled up. The car smelled almost new, not a whiff of old smoke or leftover food, not even spilled coffee. The floor mats were shiny, so was the console. I had a sneaking suspicion he\u2019d recently used Windex on the rearview mirrors. Was the man human?</p><p>Frenchmen was a narrow two-way street trolled mostly by cabs. Sullivan glanced over his shoulder, then pulled a sharp U-turn and headed for the police station.</p><p>I still had hopes that the man in the cell would not be John. My hopes were dashed by the sound of a harmonica playing \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching In\u201d even before I got close enough to recognize Rodolfo playing the thing.</p><p>A few other men were incarcerated nearby, but at this hour they were sleeping. Considering the city, and the imminence of Mardi Gras, maybe they were passed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you two alone,\u201d Sullivan murmured, and the music stopped.</p><p>John\u2019s chin went up. \u201cAnne?\u201d</p><p>He had a bruise on his forehead. \u201cWho hit him?\u201d I demanded, my fingers curling into fists.</p><p>Sullivan lifted his hands in surrender. \u201cNo one. He tripped when he was being booked.\u201d He shot a frown Rodolfo\u2019s way. \u201cSmacked his head right into the camera and broke the lens. I\u2019ll go see if they have another set up yet.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan left, quietly closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cYou need to call a lawyer, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s no need for a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously you aren\u2019t familiar with the U.S. legal system. There\u2019s always need for a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>He made his way carefully across the cement floor until he stood on the other side of the bars. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to let me out sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think so?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSullivan says you were found next to a dead woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where I was, and I couldn\u2019t exactly see what, or who, was next to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, you don\u2019t remember how you got there. Where was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStoryville.\u201d</p><p>My brow creased as I attempted to place the name. I\u2019d heard it or read it somewhere.</p><p>Then it hit me. Up until about eighty years ago, Storyville had been the only legal red-light district in the country. To this day, the place retained the dangerous aura from times gone by\u2014especially at night\u2014though I doubted the area was referred to as Storyville anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would you go there?\u201d I demanded. \u201cYou want to die?\u201d</p><p>He gave me that smile again, the one that could have meant anything\u2014yes, no, have you even been listening?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I was there,\u201d he said patiently. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you black out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor want of a better word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost time before? Woken up somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when the headaches are very bad.\u201d</p><p>Which might account for the dead bodies turning up with disturbing regularity in the Crescent City. Until now I\u2019d refused to believe John could be responsible for the killings; he didn\u2019t seem capable of it. But the more I got to know him, the more capable he became. And now that he\u2019d admitted losing time...</p><p>\u201cWe definitely need a lawyer,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d Sullivan was back. He didn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor at the morgue examined the body.\u201d He broke off to glare at Rodolfo. John smirked as if he knew what Sullivan was about to say, except the detective didn\u2019t say it. He continued to stare at John, fury seeming to roll off him in waves.</p><p>Eventually, I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. \u201cWhat did the doctor say?\u201d</p><p>Sullivan\u2019s gaze turned to me. \u201cThe rookie at the scene got a little spooked by all the blood. Throat wounds bleed like a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d And I could; what I wished was that I\u2019d stop.</p><p>\u201cThe dead woman, a river of blood, Rodolfo standing over her, hands covered with it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I was trying to resuscitate her,\u201d Rodolfo interrupted.</p><p>\u201cWith a mortal throat wound, I doubt resuscitation would work,\u201d Sullivan pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know she had a mortal throat wound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to resuscitate anyone?\u201d Sullivan pressed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Triumph spread over the detective\u2019s face, but I put an end to it. \u201cWhat did the doctor say that suddenly made you think John doesn\u2019t need a lawyer?\u201d</p><p>Sullivan\u2019s expression faded. \u201cThe throat was torn, not cut.\u201d His eyes met mine. \u201cBy an animal, not a knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother mysterious animal attack,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of animal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo soon to say.\u201d</p><p>I was starting to wonder about that werewolf; however, last night there had been a crescent moon and</p><p>not a full one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re free to go,\u201d Sullivan continued. \u201cBut don\u2019t leave town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still a suspect?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNot in this murder.\u201d</p><p>But there were so many others.</p><p>A uniformed officer escorted John away to be processed for release. I followed, but when we reached the main area, Sullivan put a hand to my elbow. \u201cI dropped the bracelet off at the lab.\u201d His face was concerned. \u201cI still wish you wouldn\u2019t stay at Rising Moon.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at John, who stood with the other officer near the front of the station. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. King\u2019s going to have the locks changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something between you and Rodolfo,\u201d Sullivan said.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>The only thing between us was sex, and really, that was nothing.</p><p>\u201cI doubt you\u2019re going to catch him in the act,\u201d Sullivan continued. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty slick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did something. I know it.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and said, \u201cYou\u2019re obsessed by this, by him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the one who\u2019s obsessed.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to go there.</p><p>I knew Sullivan liked me, that he wanted more from me than friendship. I knew I should tell him I didn\u2019t feel the same way, but I wasn\u2019t sure how. I\u2019d never once had to let someone down easy. And I didn\u2019t want to piss him off before I figured out what was going on around here. I needed his help and his goodwill.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a connection between Rodolfo and the murderers,\u201d Sullivan continued, \u201cand I will find it. I</p><p>just wish I hadn\u2019t put you in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in danger,\u201d I said, but I wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cKatie was last seen at Rising Moon. I have to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure she was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, there are ways to alter photographs. It isn\u2019t hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Would you give me the photo? Let me have it examined by an expert?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. Though I hadn\u2019t been having any luck, I still wanted to show the photograph to people in the bar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a copy,\u201d Sullivan said.</p><p>I nodded and handed him the original. He was back a few minutes later with a very good reproduction.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I tucked the new photo into my back pocket.</p><p>\u201cYou have to consider that perhaps Katie wasn\u2019t here at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the bracelet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight have been left by the person who took Katie in the first place.\u201d</p><p>A shiver passed down my back. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Anne.\u201d Sullivan stroked my cheek. His touch was nice\u2014soft and sweet, despite the size and roughness of his hand. \u201cYou can\u2019t let anything go either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re two of a kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I could tell by the look in his eyes that he wanted to kiss me. I almost told him then that we could be nothing more than friends, but before I could someone cleared his or her throat and we jumped apart.</p><p>John stood only a few feet away. I knew he hadn\u2019t seen Sullivan touching me; he couldn\u2019t know how close we\u2019d been to an embrace. Yet I felt as if, beyond the reflective sunglasses, his eyes were full of condemnation.</p><p>I stiffened. He had no claim on me, just as I had none on him. He\u2019d made that clear.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to leave?\u201d I asked, pleased that my voice sounded normal.</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d His voice dripped with sarcasm.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen Sullivan and me together, but he\u2019d obviously heard what we\u2019d said. Something about being two of a kind.</p><p>So what? We were.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d Sullivan murmured as I took John\u2019s arm and we headed for the door.</p><p>A squad car awaited us. I was tempted to say we\u2019d walk, but between the police station and</p><p>Frenchmen lay a lot of ground, and most of it was teeming with revelers in various states of inebriation. The music from Bourbon Street pulsed in the air; the multicolored lights pushed against the night sky like approaching dawn. We got in the car.</p><p>Only a few minutes later the silent officer deposited us in front of Rising Moon. The place was empty and dark. I\u2019d figured King would be waiting to hear what had happened. Instead, a note lay on the bar.</p><p>Call me. K.</p><p>King had scribbled his number below the words.</p><p>Quickly I dialed and got voice mail. I guess he wasn\u2019t too worried.</p><p>\u201cEverything is fine,\u201d I said. \u201cThere was a mistake. They released him.\u201d</p><p>I hung up and turned to John, who sat at the piano bench but didn\u2019t touch the keys.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to take you to your apartment?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI can find my own way home. I\u2019m not a cripple.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows shot up. How politically incorrect.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said slowly, uncertain what he did want from me. I sat in an overstuffed chair that faced the piano, and then I waited.</p><p>After a few more minutes of contemplation, John put his fingers to the keys and began to play. I didn\u2019t know the song, but I didn\u2019t need to. Closing my eyes, I let the emotions wash over me\u2014pounding fury, a trill of longing that gave way to the pulse of desire. Music had never affected me like this before; I doubted it ever would again.</p><p>When the last note faded, I was breathless. I opened my eyes, and he stood right in front of me. How could he move so quickly and so quietly?</p><p>The bruise on his forehead didn\u2019t appear as dark in this light. I lifted my hand to touch it, and he spun toward the window. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully chummy with Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. Could he be j ealous? I couldn\u2019t get my mind around the idea that one man could be j ealous of another over me. Such things didn\u2019t happen to plain Pis from Philly.</p><p>\u201cI spoke to him about Katie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d He turned, and the black pit of his glasses seemed to bore into my brain. I found myself spilling things I should not.</p><p>\u201cHe hired me to help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hired you to watch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe certainly didn\u2019t hire you to fuck me.\u201d His head tilted. \u201cOr maybe he did.\u201d</p><p>I leaped to my feet, which only put us so close the heat of his body washed over mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a whore,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo. Whores don\u2019t take money. Prostitutes do.\u201d</p><p>I slapped him. Or I would have if he hadn\u2019t caught my wrist before it reached his cheek. My eyes narrowed. \u201cHave you been practicing the Force, Luke?\u201d</p><p>Confusion flickered over his face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201d Star Wars. The movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get to see many movies,\u201d he said sarcastically.</p><p>Considering this one had been made long before he\u2019d lost his sight, I couldn\u2019t believe Rodolfo hadn\u2019t watched it. But I suppose everyone couldn\u2019t be a sci-fi action flick buff like me.</p><p>His fingers, which could coax such beauty from both a piano and a saxophone, were strong. They clenched, just short of brutal. \u201cThe thought that you were sent here by him, that you touched me because</p><p>\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you believe that, then you don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>He released my arm as if my skin had suddenly become scalding hot. \u201cBut I don \u2019t know you, Anne. This is sex, not love. Right?\u201d</p><p>Something in his voice made me ask, \u201cDo you want it to be love?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer for so long, I gave up. \u201cI\u2019m tired. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>I left him in the club alone, climbing the stairs, watchful for any black cats or potbellied pigs, maybe a stray chicken or two.</p><p>A thin shaft of silver from the fading crescent moon filtered through the window. I flicked on the lights, scoped the place out before I moved to shut the door, then I yelped.</p><p>John stood in the hall.</p><p>Before I could say anything, he wrapped his arms around my waist and kissed me.</p><p>The embrace was different from any we\u2019d shared before. Gentler, sweeter, but for all of that it was also more intense\u2014as if he were trying so hard to be something he was not.</p><p>He buried his face in my neck, took a deep breath and sighed. I sensed surrender in that sigh, but not surrender to the moment, to the rush and the need, but surrender to sanity, and I didn\u2019t want that. I wanted him.</p><p>Before he could withdraw, I sank to my knees, rubbing my mouth along the solid length of him. He wore only loose cotton trousers; I had no doubt there was nothing between them and him. When I tugged on the elastic waistband, I discovered I was right.</p><p>He leaned back, flicked off the lights, slammed, then locked the door. The darkness shrouded us, making me bold. My sexual experiences were minimal at best; they\u2019d never included this, and suddenly I wanted them to. Before he could stop me, I took him in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cAnne,\u201d he groaned, his hand cupping my head, thumb brushing my cheek.</p><p>I no longer craved the gentleness; I longed for something more. A scrape of my teeth against his tip, and his fingers tightened, tangling in my hair.</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d I demanded.</p><p>The rhythm wasn\u2019t hard to pick up, especially when he did as I asked, guiding my untutored mouth, encouraging me with low-voiced, slightly pornographic instructions. I\u2019d never figured myself for someone who\u2019d enj oy that, but tonight I did.</p><p>Was it because his talk of love had scared me, and I needed to put what was between us back on a plane I could live with? How could I fall for a man I knew nothing about? A man who, earlier, had been covered with the blood of a dead woman. A man whom I\u2019d suspected of murder and more?</p><p>The heat of him, the scent and the taste, called to a wildness in me I hadn\u2019t known existed until I\u2019d gone down on my knees. However, I wasn\u2019t the one begging; I was the one in control. I was more aroused than I could ever recall being and I still wore every stitch of my clothes.</p><p>My hands clutched his hips, slowed him down. I inched away, blowing a soft, warm breath across the wetness left by my mouth, and he shuddered. \u201cAnne.\u201d</p><p>I took pity and led him to my bed. He sat on the edge and I drew his shirt over his head like a child, then gave him a little shove. He fell back, everything limp\u2014except that one thing.</p><p>I wished that I could see him, admire him, but the darkness left him in shadow. So I took a page from his book and used my hands to \u201csee\u201d the rippling abdomen, the light dusting of curly, dark hair on his legs, the smooth, taut biceps.</p><p>Here and there I felt the ridge of a scar, with an especially thin, long one low on his belly. I paused, wondering if that was all that was left of the slashes he\u2019d obtained during the mugging.</p><p>I drifted my palm over his cheek, his chin, his hair. \u201cWhat color are your eyes?\u201d I murmured, and he j erked as if I\u2019d struck him.</p><p>\u201cYou mean, what color were they?\u201d</p><p>I winced. Why had I ruined the mood?</p><p>He reached for the glasses. \u201cYou want to see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said quickly, and his hand dropped back to his side.</p><p>I was still completely clothed, standing over him, completely naked. Crawling onto the bed, I indulged my fantasy, running my mouth across his warm, bronzed skin. Touching him, teasing him, causing him to beg all over again. I made up for my rude and foolish question; or at least I hoped I did.</p><p>Eons later, when he was gasping, straining, tugging at my clothes, I drew off my shirt, my pants, my underwear.</p><p>\u201cRide me,\u201d he urged, and I lowered myself onto the hard, hot bulk of him.</p><p>Perhaps it was the way he held my hips, his thumbs caressing even as his fingers gripped. Or maybe it was the way he said my name, a guttural moan that had the nuance of an endearment. Despite the intense nature of his movements, there was something tender about them too.</p><p>Regardless, when he arched, pressing upward with his body while pulling downward on mine, the orgasm was so strong I clenched my teeth to keep from screaming. As the waves of pleasure died away, we remained j oined, bodies slick with sweat. I didn\u2019t have the energy to move. Thankfully I didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>His palm skimmed the length of my back, clever fingers kneading my spine, drifting along my shoulder, down my arm, then hesitating for a fraction of a second before linking his fingers with mine.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone always want it to be love, cher?\u201d he whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>His words weren\u2019t really a statement but a question. I wasn\u2019t sure how to answer them.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to as, moments later, his steady, deep breaths revealed he\u2019d fallen asleep, even before his fingers went lax in mine. I rolled to the side, staring at the ceiling as I rubbed my thumb across his palm.</p><p>Didn\u2019t everyone always want it to be love?</p> <p>I had. But I\u2019d never thought I\u2019d meet a man who\u2019d agree. Until I\u2019d met him.</p><p>Everything had moved so fast, suspiciously so. I wasn\u2019t comfortable with my feelings for John Rodolfo, or his apparent feelings for me.</p><p>Slowly I inched from the bed and retrieved the gris-gris I\u2019d tossed onto the bathroom sink before I\u2019d headed to the police station. I remembered King\u2019s words. Could be p rotection, a curse, or even a love charm.</p><p>\u201cLove charm,\u201d I murmured, squeezing it.</p><p>John moaned in his sleep; his head thrashed back and forth.</p> <p>\u201cShh,\u201d I whispered, gazing at the gray light of dawn through the window.</p><p>I could really use some coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about gris-gris?\u201d</p><p>Maggie glanced up from the espresso machine where she was frothing milk for what appeared to be a cappuccino. The well-dressed businessman at the counter ignored both of us as he took the cup and tossed a dollar into the tip j ar.</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cYou want anything?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the chalkboard menu, brightening at what I saw there. \u201cA large Jamaican Blue Mountain.\u201d</p> <p>I loved that stuff. Might be expensive but worth every penny.</p><p>Maggie poured my coffee, then got some of her own\u2014a cheaper blend\u2014and j oined me at the nearest table. \u201cWhat do you want to know about gris-gris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re charms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does \u2018gris-gris\u2019 mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe term itself comes from the French for \u2018gray\u2019 and refers to the black and white nature of the magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re magic?\u201d</p><p>She smiled indulgently. \u201cWhat is it about \u2018charm\u2019 that you don\u2019t understand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe part where a bag of stuff is magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what\u2019s inside that counts so much as the power of the one who prepares the gris-gris, combined with a strong belief in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to make one?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI know what goes into the most popular ones, but I can\u2019t make them. I\u2019m not ordained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could make one. You\u2019re not physically incapable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But like I said, the power comes from the belief and the magic, which comes from the houngan or mambo who makes it. I\u2019m not one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould a sorcerer\u2014a...\u201d I waved my hand for the word.</p><p>\u201cBokor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Could he or she make a gris-gris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Although bokors are more apt to make an ouanga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA black-magic charm, sometimes a potion. The bokor will perform a travail\u2014a ceremony to channel the negative supernatural forces of the loas directly into the charm.\u201d</p><p>I reached into my pocket and pulled out the small bag. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Maggie stared at it warily. \u201cI doubt it\u2019s a ouanga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only have to touch them to become ill.\u201d</p><p>I dropped the thing onto the table, and she laughed. \u201cRelax. Ouangas aren\u2019t very powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cBecause good is stronger than evil.\u201d</p><p>She was so young.</p><p>\u201cIs it a gris-gris?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She reached for the bag, hesitating before touching it. \u201cYou mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. I\u2019d like to know what it\u2019s for.\u201d</p><p>She released the small string tied around the opening and poured the contents into her palm\u2014a gray concoction spotted with particles of red and purple.</p><p>\u201cIs it a love charm?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. A love charm is made of sweetness\u2014orange flower water, rose water, or sugar and the hair of the loved one.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my hand to my head and her eyes danced. \u201cUnderarm hair or pubic hair is most common.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose and she laughed at the expression before continuing. \u201cThis is...\u201d Her voice trailed off as she leaned forward and took a sniff before I could warn her. She sneezed, violently, several times.</p><p>\u201cPepper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so too, but not black pepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Something red.\u201d Her face took on a faraway expression. \u201cI know this.\u201d</p><p>Maggie got up and went behind the counter, snatching the register key, then a card for one of the computers. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>I followed her into the Internet section of the cafe, where she tapped at a keyboard, then began to surf.</p><p>I\u2019d nearly finished my huge cup of coffee before she said, \u201cHere we go. The combination of ashes from an outdoor flame and red pepper is a charm against beasts of the swamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not in the swamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, this whole city is a swamp; you just showed up during the dry season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see the ashes and the red pepper, but what made it purple?\u201d</p><p>Maggie tapped at the computer a few more times then gave a low whistle. \u201cMaybe I was wrong about this not being a ounga.\u201d</p><p>I moved closer, uneasy. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe texture of the purple bits, the slightly musty scent\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s monkshood.\u201d She glanced at me. \u201cWolfsbane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s poisonous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if ingested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe addition of monkshood will fortify an everyday charm against earthbound beasts into a charm against a supernatural monster.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cA loup-garou.\u201d</p><p>My skin suddenly felt prickly, itchy, too small for my body. The word was far too familiar.</p><p>\u201cLougaro? Didn\u2019t we already go here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. A lougaro is a voodoo shapeshifter, a sorcerer who can shift into pretty much any animal he wants to. A loup-garou is a French werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head hurts,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a legend.\u201d She paused, then glanced around the cafe uneasily before continuing. \u201cA legend of New Orleans, passed down only to those who believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn oral tradition.\u201d</p><p>After last night, I was thinking of starting my own oral tradition. I yanked my mind away from the image of John Rodolfo naked in my bed. I had work to do.</p><p>\u201cThis story isn\u2019t written down anywhere?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I was told, anyone who\u2019s tried to do so has wound up dead.\u201d</p><p>An involuntary bark of laughter escaped. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell it to the dead people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie, you really believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s just say I \u2019m not going to write it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are going to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>She glanced around again, then began. \u201cOver a hundred years ago a man was cursed to run as a wolf beneath the crescent moon.\u201d</p><p>I started, remembering the thin, smiling crescent moon that had risen last night. Coincidence? Not if I believed Maggie\u2019s theory that there were none.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t werewolves come out under the full moon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA loup-garou is different. According to the legend, a loup-garou is cursed, not bitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that whole thing about werewolves making other werewolves by biting them is true?\u201d Or as true as a superstition gets.</p><p>\u201cSo I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was this man cursed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlave owner. One of his possessions placed a voodoo curse on him. Can\u2019t say that I blame her.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t either.</p><p>\u201cHow did she manage it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoodoo queen. They aren\u2019t anyone you want to screw with.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d take her word on it.</p><p>\u201cSo this voodoo queen cursed the man to become a werewolf under the crescent moon?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe I was having this conversation, but I had asked.</p><p>\u201cSo the legend says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a werewolf and a loup-garou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can both be killed with silver, but werewolves are compelled to shift and to kill beneath the full moon\u2014one night only\u2014although I\u2019ve heard they can transform any night if they choose. However, the loup-garou must shift and kill beneath the crescent moon, which arrives twice during a lunar cycle\u2014both waning and waxing\u2014and each crescent lasts several days.\u201d</p><p>Which meant a loup-garou would be under the control of the moon much longer than most. The curse was very clever, ensuring the former slave owner was subj ect to something he could not control, which was only what he deserved. Unfortunately, because of it, other people had suffered.</p><p>If I believed in curses, which I didn\u2019t any more than I believed in werewolves of any flavor. Still, I couldn\u2019t help but be curious.</p><p>\u201cYou said the woman who performed the curse was a voodoo queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you called Cassandra a priestess. What\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew Orleans voodoo has always been more about the magic and the mystery than the religion, so most of the leaders have been referred to as queens or kings, with the queens being more powerful. In Haiti, the leaders are referred to as houngans and mambos, or priests and priestesses, to reflect their emphasis on voodoo as a religion.\u201d</p><p>Made sense.</p><p>\u201cBut if this voodoo queen performed a curse, doesn\u2019t that make her a bokor?\u201d</p><p>Maggie smiled. \u201cIn a way. Every voodoo practitioner knows both the good and the bad. Voodoo is about balance\u2014in the universe, the community, the soul. Only someone who knows and understands evil would have any hope of thwarting it. Each initiate to the priesthood studies black magic; they just swear never to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she had a good reason.\u201d</p><p>I was sure she\u2019d had plenty of them.</p><p>\u201cHow does one go about placing a curse?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe person doing the cursing would call on the loas for help. Each loa has a light and a dark side, rada and p etro. To call the dark side requires blood, usually a large animal, maybe a pig.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened. Why did pigs keep cropping up?</p><p>The question was shoved from my mind as I had another, much more unpleasant idea. \u201cWhat about human sacrifice?\u201d</p><p>Maggie shook her head. \u201cThe movies and books have demonized voodoo with the idea that we perform human sacrifice, but we don\u2019t. Voodoo is a religion of love and peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet the sacrificial pig doesn\u2019t feel too loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither does your pork chop, but that doesn\u2019t stop you from eating it.\u201d</p><p>Good p oint.</p><p>Still, what if someone was taking the Hollywood version of voodoo for the truth and sacrificing people all over town? Maggie had said that voodoo rituals were best performed under the full moon. The idea was something to ponder, and perhaps share with Sullivan.</p><p>\u201cYou said there are many loas. Would a particular one be called on for cursing?\u201d</p><p>Maggie tapped the computer again. \u201cBaron Samedi is a Gede, a spirit of death. Neither a rada nor a p etro spirit, the Gede are separate. They rule the realm of the dead. To curse someone to become a werewolf, you\u2019d probably call on the Baron. He\u2019s the most powerful Gede and controls shapeshifting and the reanimation of corpses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZombies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to say to that, so I moved on. \u201cYou think this voodoo queen called on Baron Samedi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would make the most sense. Although some might call on a loa they have a particular affinity with.</p><p>Voodoo\u2019s kind of fluid. People make a lot up as they go along. Whatever works.\u201d Maggie fiddled with the computer again. \u201cHere\u2019s Baron Samedi.\u201d</p><p>I moved in for a closer glimpse of the drawing that had sprung up on the screen. The man wore a frock coat, top hat, and sunglasses. He carried a walking stick in one hand and a long, thin, dark cigarette in the other.</p><p>Maggie tapped the cigarette. \u201cThe Gede are often pictured with tobacco, which is their particular favorite. They\u2019re the only loa completely indigenous to Haiti, with no corresponding African tribal spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought voodoo originated in Haiti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Slaves from every African society were brought there. Each one contributed pieces of their religion to a new one, which became voodoo. They also adopted some of the practices of Catholicism, which they were forced to accept right off the boat, along with the rest.\u201d</p><p>Something about the picture of Baron Samedi was so familiar. Which made no sense since the Gede wasn\u2019t real\u2014or at least corporeal. Nevertheless...</p><p>If I took away the frock coat and the top hat, which were out of date anyway, that left sunglasses, a walking stick, and that foreign cigarette.</p><p>\u201cRodolfo,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boss.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cNever mind. It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d I pointed at the screen. \u201cHe kind of looks like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird.\u201d Maggie glanced from the computer to me, and then back again, frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRodolfo means \u2018wolf\u2019.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cIt means what?\u201d I asked, and my voice was far too loud for the silent, empty room.</p><p>\u201cWolf. In Spanish.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cA lot of old names do. It was a common choice because wolves were seen as strong, independent, and loyal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me. Miss?\u201d</p> <p>A skeletal old man stood in the doorway, squinting as if the light were too bright, or perhaps his glasses weren\u2019t thick enough. His expression had drawn his eyebrows together until they resembled a bushy, white unibrow.</p><p>The guy kind of creeped me out. No one could be that skinny, or that pale, and live. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>Maggie stood. \u201cI\u2019d love something to drink, child. I\u2019m parched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She smiled at me. \u201cPlaytime\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cI appreciate the help.\u201d</p> <p>She hurried from the Internet section into the cafe. The old man glanced at me as he followed, and the sun caught his eyes the way a camera flash sometimes does, turning them briefly red. I liked him even less than before.</p><p>Then the red disappeared and his eyes were just blue again; unfortunately, my paranoia remained.</p><p>So Rodolfo\u2019s name meant wolf. As Maggie had pointed out, it was a common enough derivation for very old surnames, and around here, I bet many of them were as old as the swamp.</p><p>However, since Maggie had left the computer card in the computer, I decided I\u2019d make use of it. I typed in \u201cloup-garou,\u201d got back nothing I didn\u2019t already have, but I did find a list of ways to determine if someone was a werewolf.</p><p>I hit print, then started to read.</p><p>Hair on the p alms.</p> <p>\u201cNot that I noticed.\u201d</p><p>Purp le urine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll check that one.\u201d</p><p>Unnaturally long middle or ring f inger.</p><p>I frowned. John had very long fingers, but none of them seemed any longer than the others.</p><p>Call the beast \u2019s human name while he \u2019s in wolf f orm, and he will revert to his human shap e.</p><p>Which only worked if I happened upon a werewolf, and I really hoped that I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Pass iron over the head of the aff licted.</p> <p>\u201cHmm. That\u2019s doable.\u201d</p><p>I felt kind of foolish as I read over the choices, but as my mom always said, better safe than sorry.</p><p>Having the list would hurt no one, except maybe Rodolfo. If he was a werewolf.</p><p>I shoved the sheet of paper into my pocket and went to say good-bye to Maggie. Except she wasn\u2019t there. Behind the counter stood a young African-American man with skin the color of latte and impossibly tiny braids.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where Maggie went,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I decided not to wait. I was certain I\u2019d need coffee, if not information, again.</p><p>I considered returning to Rising Moon, but decided against it. I wasn\u2019t tired, thanks to the Jamaican Blue Mountain, and what would I do there anyway but brood?</p><p>Instead I made my way through the shops, tourist and antique, searching for something that would help me. I found it not long after lunchtime.</p><p>\u201cRemember to hang the horseshoe open side up over your doorway,\u201d the saleslady said as she rang up my purchase, \u201cotherwise all your luck will run out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIn Europe most horseshoes are hung open side down, so the luck runs into you.\u201d She frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure which way I\u2019d hang mine, because in both traditions, if you do it wrong, bad luck follows.\u201d</p><p>Since I didn\u2019t believe in luck, good, bad, or otherwise, I wasn\u2019t worried. Although considering I was buying a horseshoe as a werewolf test, maybe I should reconsider.</p><p>\u201cThis is made of iron?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course, ever since iron was discovered that\u2019s what horseshoes have been made out of. Before, they used a kind of rawhide boot, which just wasn\u2019t the same.\u201d</p><p>Before she could launch into a treatise on the wonder of the Iron Age, I thanked her and made my escape.</p><p>By the time I returned to Rising Moon, afternoon waned. I was disturbed to realize that I\u2019d left my anti-werewolf gris-gris at the coffee shop. I only hoped I wouldn\u2019t need it any more than I needed the horseshoe.</p><p>King was already ensconced behind the bar. When I asked him for a hammer and nails he obliged.</p><p>\u201cSomethin\u2019 wrong with your place? I\u2019ll fix it.\u201d I shook my head and pulled the horseshoe out of the bag.</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cWhat in hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA smelly old horseshoe.\u201d</p><p>I took a whiff. \u201cDoesn\u2019t smell like anything but metal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThing spent years marinatin\u2019 in horse manure, girlie. That don\u2019t wash off as easily as you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to hang it over my door for luck.\u201d</p><p>Who knows, maybe having it there would keep whoever waltzed in and out at their leisure from continuing to do so. Better even than a new lock and key\u2014though I\u2019d take the latter, as well.</p><p>\u201cDid you get the locks changed yet?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cGuy can\u2019t come until after Mardi Gras. He\u2019s an Indian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does being Native American have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>King shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about New Orleans, do ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re gonna be around for Fat Tuesday, you\u2019d better know more. The Indians are groups of African-American men who parade on Mardi Gras, also Saint Joseph\u2019s night and the Sunday closest to it, Super Sunday. Every year they make new suits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuits,\u201d I repeated, as an image of a black man in a crisp summer suit, face painted like a Comanche, got stuck in my head.</p><p>\u201cCostumes,\u201d King clarified. \u201cIndian costumes, with beads and plumes and feathers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTradition. Some say the Indians started when Buffalo Bill\u2019s Wild West Show came through town. Others believe they began because so many escaped slaves took refuge with the Indian tribes. No one really knows for certain. But the Mardi Gras Indians are a big deal, and the locksmith ain\u2019t comin\u2019 until the season is done.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I\u2019d just have to depend on the horseshoe, and maybe a chair under the doorknob, for added security.</p><p>I gathered everything into my hands. \u201cThanks, King.\u201d</p><p>As I left, he muttered, \u201cCrazy white folks and their dumbass traditions.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d better watch it or I might really start to like him.</p><p>My bed was empty. I hadn\u2019t expected John to be there. Should be glad he wasn\u2019t since I was nailing the horseshoe up for him. Or was that against him?</p><p>I dragged a chair across the floor, climbed on top and went to work. I was pretty good with a hammer, and I finished a few minutes later.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all the noise?\u201d</p><p>Since I hadn\u2019t heard anyone come up the stairs or even down the hall, I started. The sudden movement caused the chair to teeter. I gasped, dropped the hammer, and pinwheeled my arms. I was going to fall and crack my head on the floor like a melon.</p><p>Then John was there, grabbing me around the waist. His save was a little clumsy\u2014he socked me in the stomach first\u2014but I didn\u2019t care. The chair fell backward and I tipped forward, sliding all the way down his body until my feet met solid ground.</p><p>My heart threatened to burst from my chest; I was dizzy with adrenaline. I could do nothing but hold on to him.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I rested my cheek against his shoulder. I couldn\u2019t speak for several seconds. When my voice returned, along with my breath, I leaned back. My gaze lifted to the horseshoe, visible behind Rodolfo\u2019s head.</p><p>When he\u2019d grabbed me around the waist, he\u2019d stepped into my room and directly beneath the iron.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help myself. I kissed him\u2014for quite a while. When I finished we were both breathless.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNot too bad. Why?\u201d</p><p>I made a noncommittal sound, continuing to peer at the horseshoe, uncertain. I wasn\u2019t sure what was supposed to happen if a werewolf walked beneath iron. Did John\u2019s being able to cross beneath it mean he wasn\u2019t a werewolf? Or did it just mean he wasn\u2019t one right now? Hell, maybe it meant the test didn\u2019t work at all.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe I was actually worrying about this. I\u2019d seen John on the night of the full moon; for that matter, I\u2019d seen him on the night of a crescent moon too. My behavior was nothing short of foolish, if not paranoid.</p><p>I inched out of his embrace, moving the chair against the wall before one of us tripped over it. \u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d he asked. \u201cHanging a horseshoe over my door.\u201d His eyebrows lifted. \u201cNeed some luck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t hurt. I haven\u2019t found my sister yet.\u201d</p><p>His lighter expression faded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have to be sorry for?\u201d</p><p>He turned away. \u201cI know it upsets you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any brothers or sisters?\u201d</p><p>Rodolfo stilled. I\u2019d gone too far, gotten too personal, which seemed an impossibility considering the amount of spit we\u2019d swapped, but I guess there were lines between us I wasn\u2019t aware of.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he murmured, and the word hung heavy in the air between us.</p><p>How could I have forgotten? All of his family were dead. What did it feel like to be both blind and alone in the world? I didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>I laid my hand on his back, felt the slight tremble beneath his black cotton shirt. I wanted to take him in my arms and murmur to him like a child, but from the way he tensed, I doubted he\u2019d let me.</p><p>John turned his face toward the door. King hovered in the hall. I hadn\u2019t heard him come up the stairs either, and I doubted the big man was very light on his feet. \u201cProblem?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cSomeone downstairs to see you.\u201d He was looking at me. From the curl of his lip, I knew who it was even before he said, \u201cThat detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I murmured, but King was already gone. \u201cI don\u2019t like him,\u201d Rodolfo muttered.</p><p>\u201cHey, he works for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding?\u201d I said. \u201cI never would have gotten that from the way you two pal around.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. Wow. I\u2019d almost made him laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he want?\u201d John wondered.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t know until he tells me.\u201d I stepped into the hall, glanced back. \u201cYou coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve had enough of his company.\u201d</p><p>I guess I wouldn\u2019t be all that eager to talk to the man who\u2019d tried to pin me with serial murder either.</p><p>Dusk approached as I entered Rising Moon. King bustled behind the bar; Sullivan stood at the front window; an older gentleman nursed a Bloody Mary near the rear. He must have been a friend of King\u2019s since we weren\u2019t technically open for business.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said, as I j oined Sullivan.</p><p>Sunset cast multicolored shadows over Frenchmen Street, making both the people and the cars appear frozen in a bygone century. There were times since coming to New Orleans that I really wished I could paint.</p><p>Sullivan glanced at King, who must have been staring, maybe glaring, because the detective\u2019s expression hardened, and he took my elbow, turning me so that we both faced away from the bartender. \u201cI have the results on the bracelet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was fast.\u201d Excitement made my voice both too high and too loud. Sullivan scowled, and I lowered it. \u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blood was AB positive.\u201d</p><p>My heart lurched. \u201cKatie\u2019s blood type.\u201d</p><p>His brown eyes flicked to mine, then away. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the blood was hers.\u201d</p><p>True. Except\u2014</p><p>\u201cAB positive only occurs in about three percent of the population.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill\u2014\u201d He spread his hands.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if I should be happy or sad that the blood on the bracelet might be Katie\u2019s. Blood was probably not a good thing, but at least it was something. After so many years of nothing, I couldn\u2019t help but be encouraged.</p><p>\u201cWe could do a DNA test,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut we\u2019d have to have your sister\u2019s DNA as a comparison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be a problem. I\u2019ll have my parents drop off her hairbrush at the lab in Philadelphia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe test could take a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey always do.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan glanced at his feet, shifted his shoulders, sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe photograph.\u201d He lifted his head. \u201cIt was altered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAltered how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe picture of Katie was combined with a photo of Rising Moon.\u201d</p><p>My heart lurched. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t really here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like it.\u201d</p><p>Which might explain why no one I\u2019d shown the picture to had recognized her. Or it might just be that I hadn\u2019t found the right person yet.</p><p>\u201cWhy would someone do that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cTo get you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? No one cares about me.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan touched my elbow. \u201cThat\u2019s not true, Anne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. I\u2019m just a PI from Philly. Why would anyone want me in New Orleans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I plan to find out.\u201d</p><p>The digitally combined photograph disturbed me. Not for the first time since coming to New Orleans, I felt stalked.</p><p>\u201cI think you should stay with me,\u201d Sullivan said.</p><p>I tensed and a flicker passed over his face; it was there and then gone so fast I wasn\u2019t able to discern what the expression had meant.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I said, and Sullivan\u2019s hand fell away from my arm.</p><p>I wished I could feel for him what he seemed to feel for me. Maybe if we\u2019d met back in Philly, before Rodolfo and New Orleans had seeped into my blood and made me long for something more, things might have been different.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbut I had to try.\u201d</p><p>I wondered how much he knew about John and me, or how much he\u2019d figured out.</p><p>Sullivan glanced away, then shuffled his feet and hunched his shoulders. I was starting to understand his shorthand.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>Sullivan took a deep breath, then let it out before answering. \u201cThe dirt.\u201d</p><p>The tiny flutter of hope in my chest bloomed. \u201cWere you able to figure out where it was from?\u201d That would be huge.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d he said, still not looking at me.</p><p>\u201d What exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dirt had certain properties that made it different from run-of-the-mill dirt.\u201d</p><p>The science of forensics was so recent; new methods were being discovered every day and old ones were being refined. However, I couldn\u2019t recall anything about the analysis of dirt.</p><p>\u201cYou lost me,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>At last, Sullivan turned his face in my direction. I didn\u2019t like what I saw in his eyes. \u201cThe particles on the bracelet were graveyard dirt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dirt came from a graveyard,\u201d Sullivan repeated softly. \u201cAn old one\u2014back when people weren\u2019t so particular about how they buried their dead.\u201d</p><p>In other words, a place where bones and other body parts would mix in with the soil.</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot conclusively, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if we prove through DNA that the blood is Katie\u2019s, that might just mean she bled on the bracelet, then dropped it somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a graveyard?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt could happen.\u201d</p> <p>Sullivan didn\u2019t comment, for which I was glad. I knew I was grasping at air, but right now, I needed to.</p><p>He put his hand on my shoulder and drew me closer. \u201cI wanted to tell you in person.\u201d</p><p>I leaned on him, even though I shouldn\u2019t. I identified with Sullivan; I just plain liked him, but I didn\u2019t love him.</p><p>I rubbed my face against his shirt; my chest went tight with a longing to stay where I was safe, with a man who presented no mystery. But as his arms came around me, I knew that I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>I inched away, surprised to discover a slash of wet across his light green dress shirt. I flicked his tie \u2014navy blue like his j acket and dotted with teeny-tiny shamrocks\u2014with my index finger. \u201cI messed up your shirt,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He brushed my loose hair away from my face. \u201cYou can mess me up anytime, Anne.\u201d</p> <p>I took his hand, squeezed his fingers. His gaze went past my shoulder, and his tender expression disappeared.</p><p>John Rodolfo had arrived. His face turned toward us, his sunglasses shaded his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cJohn?\u201d I began, and he went out the back door, into the approaching darkness.</p><p>King shot me a dirty look, and I opened my mouth to defend myself, then thought better of it. I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.</p><p>So why did it feel as if I had?</p><p>Because I was the queen of guilt. I couldn\u2019t forgive myself for not protecting Katie, couldn\u2019t get over my inability to find her. I could find anyone, except the one person I really needed to.</p><p>And the one man I\u2019d ever felt anything for was a man I kept hurting without even trying to.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming to tell me.\u201d I released Sullivan\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll call my parents about the DNA test.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d He reached for his wallet. \u201cI owe you money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Sullivan\u2019s golden eyebrows shot up.</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2014forget it. I never found out anything and\u2014\u201d I paused, then plunged ahead with the truth. \u201cI told Rodolfo that you hired me.\u201d</p><p>The idea of taking money from Sullivan after I\u2019d betrayed his trust, blown my cover, consorted with the enemy\u2014take your pick\u2014was an idea I couldn\u2019t stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do that for?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t who you think he is, Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met mine and concern softened the dark depths. \u201cHe isn\u2019t who you think he is either.\u201d</p><p>After promising to phone a colleague in the Philadelphia police department and ask for help expediting my sister\u2019s DNA test, Sullivan left. I watched him walk away, his tall, bulky form a shadow against the encroaching night.</p><p>I made a quick call to my parents, spent several minutes apologizing for not calling them earlier, then biting my tongue to keep from saying, \u201cThe phone works both ways.\u201d I loved them, but sometimes they drove me nuts.</p><p>\u201cHave you found anything?\u201d my mother asked.</p><p>I hesitated, unwilling to mention Katie\u2019s bracelet, the blood or the graveyard dirt until I absolutely had to.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut we might have a lead. I need you to take Katie\u2019s hairbrush to Detective Ransom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need a DNA sample.\u201d</p><p>The line went silent. I could hear both of them breathing.</p><p>\u201cIs she dead?\u201d my father asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said firmly.</p><p>\u201cAnne,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said again. \u201cUntil I see her body, she isn\u2019t dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Annie,\u201d my mother soothed. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I said good-bye before they could ask any more questions and make me feel guiltier than I already did.</p><p>I turned away from the front window, where I\u2019d gone to make my call, and stopped short at the sight of King\u2019s glower.</p><p>\u201cDid John come back?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>King\u2019s Bloody Mary-drinking pal had left too, presumably by the back door since he hadn\u2019t passed me on his way out the front. I peered through the screen, hoping I\u2019d catch the scent of Rodolfo\u2019s cigarette nearby.</p><p>The thought made me remember the sketch of Baron Samedi. Voodoo might be a legitimate religion, but there was too much magic in it for me to become a believer. That I\u2019d even considered John might be masquerading as a Gede to become a werewolf, or help someone else do so, only proved how much this place was getting to me.</p><p>I should leave, ASAP, but I wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>I sniffed the air; I did smell smoke. Curious, I stepped through the door and caught sight of a shadow slinking past the garbage cans.</p><p>I leaned inside. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of your cat?\u201d</p><p>King\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cWhat cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe black one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere ain\u2019t no cat at Rising Moon, girlie. Never has been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d I stopped. Maybe the cat was a stray. I wasn\u2019t going to argue.</p><p>Especially when I stepped onto the porch again and heard the distinct sounds of claws scrabbling nearby.</p><p>I rounded the heavy barrels and squinted into the darkness that loomed in the narrow passage between Rising Moon and the building next door. Keeping my eyes fixed on the other end of the alley, I followed, freezing when a distinctly canine silhouette appeared.</p><p>I tried to catch my breath and couldn\u2019t. I also couldn\u2019t tell in the faint light of the crescent moon if the apparition was a dog, a coyote, or a wolf. As it turned onto Frenchmen, I started to run.</p><p>The ancient pavement beneath my feet was slick with Lord knows what. I skidded and slipped, but eventually managed to burst out the other side of the narrow opening.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t an animal of any kind in sight.</p><p>I grabbed the nearest tourist. \u201cDid you see a\u2014a dog run by?\u201d</p><p>The man, wearing so many Mardi Gras beads his shoulders slumped from the weight, snickered and spilled most of his cocktail down the front of my shirt. \u201cYou drunk?\u201d he asked, which I thought incredibly ballsy considering the source.</p><p>I stared at the spreading bronze stain on my white blouse. \u201cShorry,\u201d he said, and began to brush it away, copping a feel in the process.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I snapped, and he lifted his hands in surrender so I didn\u2019t have to slug him. As I hurried past he announced, \u201cWith a face like that, the least you could do is have a decent set of jugs.\u201d</p><p>He and his friends burst into laughter. I reconsidered slugging him, but settled on the hope that they would come into Rising Moon later so I could spit into every one of their drinks.</p><p>I fought against the crowd; King was going to be overwhelmed if I didn\u2019t get back soon, but even that concern didn\u2019t stop me. I\u2019d seen something, and I was going to find out what it was.</p><p>At last the crowd thinned. Ahead I caught sight of Sullivan\u2019s familiar silhouette. I opened my mouth to call out just as he ducked down a side street.</p><p>Should I follow him, or continue in the direction I\u2019d been going? If there\u2019d been a wolf, or anything else strange on Frenchmen, wouldn\u2019t someone have commented by now?</p><p>I was starting to believe I was seeing things, if not hearing them, when a long, low howl rose toward the sickle-shaped moon.</p><p>Only a few people milled on the street near me, but several of them stopped, frowned, and glanced at the sky.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d I asked the nearest woman.</p><p>\u201cCoyote?\u201d she said. \u201cSounded awful close.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a coyote, and I figured it was closer than any of us realized. I sprinted for the opening</p><p>between the buildings where Sullivan had disappeared, then froze at the sight.</p><p>Too big to be a dog, too solid for a coyote, in truth the thing was bigger than any wolf should be. The trickle of silver from above kept me from identifying any color beyond pale, the bright lights behind me and the dimness of the alley in front kept me from seeing its eyes. As I stood, paralyzed, the beast lifted its snout and howled again.</p><p>The sound was so loud, so wild, so shocking, I blinked, and in that instant the wolf disappeared.</p><p>The absence allowed me to move, if not to think; I shot forward, away from the bustle and relative safety of Decatur Street, from the streetlights, the music, the people, and into the solitary darkness of that forgotten alleyway.</p><p>I ran hell-bent for the opposite end and tripped over something in the middle.</p><p>Flying forward, my hands scraping the pavement, I sprawled on top of someone, and slipped when I tried to get up in what I really hoped wasn\u2019t blood, but probably was.</p><p>I opened my mouth to scream, but not a sound came out. My mind floundered as badly as my legs. It took me several seconds to think what to do.</p><p>I patted my pockets for the books of matches promoting Rising Moon, which I handed out at work whenever I was asked for a light, and struck one.</p><p>The snick was loud in the narrow alley that suddenly seemed so removed from the rest of the world. The glow was dim; yet enough to illuminate the victim\u2019s bloodstained face.</p><p>\u201cSullivan?\u201d I whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>His eyes were closed; he didn\u2019t appear to be breathing. There was so much blood; I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. Not in this light.</p><p>I leaned in, thought I felt the drift of his breath across my cheek, then the match burned down to my fingertips, and I dropped it, cursing.</p><p>Instead of lighting another, I scooted closer, ignoring the dampness of the ground beneath me and the metallic scent of blood all around me. Placing my palm on his chest, I closed my eyes.</p> <p>I thought I detected a slight rise and fall, but I couldn\u2019t be sure. I strained to hear something, anything, and caught a faint whistle.</p><p>I lit another match, and with it started the whole book on fire. The resulting conflagration revealed what the single, tiny flame had not.</p><p>Sullivan\u2019s throat was a mess.</p><p>\u201cShit, shit, shit,\u201d I muttered as I tossed the matchbook into a damp corner where it hissed, smoldered, and went out. Then I punched nine-one-one into my cell phone.</p><p>The connection was fuzzy between the two buildings, but I didn\u2019t want to leave him. Instead, I shouted to be heard and held on to Sullivan\u2019s hand.</p> <p>\u201cOfficer down!\u201d That should bring them running.</p><p>I gave my name and our location, then agreed to wave them in as soon as I saw their sparkly red lights.</p><p>\u201cHang on, Conner.\u201d I squeezed his hand and nearly jumped out of my skin when he squeezed back.</p><p>His eyes opened, shining far too brightly considering the lack of light. The wheezing whistle became louder. I wanted to put my hand over the gap in his throat, and then again, I didn\u2019t. He tried to talk, coughed, and something gurgled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I urged. \u201cThe ambulance is on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee it?\u201d he managed.</p> <p>I opened my mouth to ask what, but I knew. \u201cThe wolf?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and closed his eyes. I took that as a yes.</p><p>\u201cEyes.\u201d The word whispered out, low and desperate.</p><p>\u201cDo they hurt?\u201d My fingers fluttered over his face.</p><p>My knowledge of first aid was limited to CPR, which, from the size of the hole in his throat, was not going to do either of us any good. For all I knew, pain in the eyes signaled imminent death.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His hand tightened almost painfully on mine, which encouraged me. He was still strong; he didn\u2019t seem to be fading. \u201cThe wolf\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople eyes.\u201d Sullivan took a deep, uneven breath. \u201cWerewolf.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSullivan,\u201d I began, though I\u2019m not sure what I planned to say.</p><p>His own eyes flew open and once again they seemed lit by an inner flame. Reaching up, he grabbed me by the collar of my shirt and pulled.</p><p>\u201cKnew them,\u201d he said, so softly I would never have heard the words if we hadn\u2019t been nose to nose.</p><p>\u201cYou knew the eyes?\u201d I repeated.</p><p>He closed his in acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cWhose were they?\u201d</p><p>Sullivan didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cSullivan? Conner!\u201d I shook him a little, but he\u2019d passed out.</p><p>Sirens wailed in the distance, coming closer, shrieking louder than the crowds, the music, any howling there might have been out there in the dark.</p><p>As if someone had thrown a switch, silver light splashed into the alley, and I lifted my face to the cheery crescent moon that had climbed high enough to peek past the buildings shielding us.</p><p>I should have been happy for the illumination; instead I began to shiver.</p><p>The police arrived shortly thereafter; the ambulance right behind. The moon shone down like a beacon.</p><p>Emergency services stopped right outside the alley and ran toward us without being hailed.</p><p>Then the lights were too bright, the voices too numerous. I wanted to go back to my room and hide.</p><p>Especially since I was covered with blood, muck, and the remnants of that drunken guy\u2019s cocktail.</p><p>Looked like I wasn\u2019t going to get a chance to spit in his drink after all. Bummer.</p><p>I tried to call King, to tell him I wasn\u2019t going to be able to work, but no one answered the phone at Rising Moon. A little while later I caught sight of him lurking in the crowd. The noise and lights must have drawn him out, though I had to wonder who was minding the store.</p><p>I lifted my hand, and he acknowledged me with a sharp nod and a scowl at all the hoopla. He wasn\u2019t happy he\u2019d be working solo, but he understood.</p><p>I scanned the crowd for John, but he wasn\u2019t there. Perhaps he could help King, though cocktail- waitressing was probably beyond even his spectacular abilities.</p><p>Emergency services whisked Sullivan away as quickly as they could. No one would tell me if he would live or die; everyone appeared grim, especially when I told them what I\u2019d seen.</p><p>\u201cA wolf?\u201d The detective, who\u2019d identified himself as Mueller, shook his head. \u201cThere haven\u2019t been any wolves in Louisiana for over two decades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I hear. But you got one now. A freaking big one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow big?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout one seventy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re describing is impossible. A large male timber wolf would run about one twenty in Alaska.</p><p>Lower forty-eight they don\u2019t get over eighty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to know an awful lot about wolves for an officer in a town that doesn\u2019t have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had sightings. Of course in New Orleans, we get reports of black panthers, leopards, wild boars, and dragons, which usually increase in number and frequency right around this time of year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea why,\u201d I murmured as I watched the crowd weave drunkenly past.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never found any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard there was one rabid wolf in the swamp a year or so back.\u201d</p><p>His brow lifted. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully well informed for a newcomer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t become private investigators because they like the outfit.\u201d Whatever it was. \u201cMost of the time it\u2019s because we\u2019re curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNosy,\u201d he muttered, and I didn\u2019t contradict him. \u201cA wolf was reported. Powers that be brought in an outside hunter.\u201d</p><p>That j ibed with what Sullivan had said. However, I was starting to wonder about that outside hunter.</p><p>Who had he been? What, exactly, had he done? And where had he gone?</p><p>\u201cMy theory is that people see coyotes,\u201d Mueller continued. \u201cCity folk don\u2019t know the difference. Anything wild and canine\u2014must be a wolf. Except for a coyote to come into town...\u201d He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t happen. Might have been a big dog or a hybrid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven an oversized canine, or a wolf-dog mix wouldn\u2019t attack a man of Sullivan\u2019s size unless it was nuts,\u201d</p><p>I agreed. \u201cOr rabid.\u201d</p><p>Mueller started, then scribbled something on his notepad. Noticing my curiosity, he explained. \u201cThe detective will need shots if they can\u2019t find the animal.\u201d</p><p>One glance at Sullivan\u2019s throat and several of the officers had fanned out into the city. So far no one had reported finding anything\u2014not a wolf, not a coyote, not a slavering naked man covered in blood.</p><p>I winced at the thought, but once I\u2019d had it, several others followed.</p><p>A wolf that wasn\u2019t a wolf. A beast with human eyes. One that appeared beneath the crescent moon. In New Orleans that meant one thing.</p><p>Loup -garou.</p><p>I needed to talk to Maggie. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t know where she lived or even her last name.</p><p>I decided to head to the hospital instead. I\u2019d already missed work. Mueller had kept me hanging around for hours. I doubted I\u2019d sleep. I had to find out how Sullivan was doing. Sure, I could call, but I figured I\u2019d have better results if I stood there until they answered me.</p><p>Mueller offered to give me a lift, but I could tell he was just being polite; he had a lot more to do at the crime scene.</p><p>I hailed a cab and shortly thereafter I was dropped off at the entrance to the ER. I should have known something was wrong even before I reached the chaos in the waiting room. An ambulance idled in the drive, but no one was inside; the rear cargo doors hung open as if someone had jumped out in one helluva hurry.</p><p>Maybe the patient had coded.</p><p>My steps increased in pace, wondering if perhaps that patient had been Sullivan.</p><p>I burst through the doors, causing the small huddle of people in the corner to jump; some of them gasped.</p><p>They all stared at me with the pale faces and shocked eyes of accident victims.</p><p>Several chairs were upended. A table was smashed into kindling. The reception desk loomed empty.</p><p>Beyond it, several nurses, doctors, and security personnel had their heads stuck together in deep discussion. From what I could see, there\u2019d been a rampage back there too. Broken glass sparkled on the floor, shiny metal instruments had been tossed hither and yon, one of the white curtains separating the patient care areas appeared to have been shredded by a knife.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I called.</p><p>Every one of the hospital employees in the small group looked at me. Their faces were tense with shock.</p><p>My nerves began to dance beneath my skin like Mexican jumping beans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to check on a friend.\u201d</p><p>One woman separated from the rest. Though her smile was strained, she still managed one. She\u2019d no doubt perfected the expression from years in a very difficult j ob. I couldn\u2019t imagine how many hysterical people she dealt with each day in a place labeled \u201cemergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a bit of trouble here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSeems like more than a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Her smile faded. \u201cWho\u2019s your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSullivan. Detective Conner.\u201d</p><p>The nurse had been bending over her desk, peering at her admission sheet. Now she glanced up and her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014um. Doctor?\u201d she called.</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>One of the white coats left the crowd and j oined her. \u201cShe\u2019s asking about the detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>With a quick glance at the still-hovering ER waiting room crowd, the doctor murmured, \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>He strode through a second door marked HOSPITAL PERSONNEL ONLY. Just inside, he stopped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Haverough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharmed,\u201d I snapped, my increasing nervousness making my borderline manners go south. \u201cWhere\u2019s Sullivan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a mortal throat wound?\u201d</p><p>The doctor, who appeared far too young and far too tired to be working here, rubbed his chin. \u201cMore mortal than you know.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my forehead. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe detective coded in the ambulance. We tried to resuscitate him, but we were unsuccessful. He was pronounced dead.\u201d</p><p>Tears scalded my eyes; my breath burned in my chest.</p><p>\u201cThen he got up, trashed the place, and ran out the front door.\u201d</p><p>My tears receded as my lungs suddenly filled with air. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t send him for an immediate autopsy.\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened. \u201cMistakes are made, and miracles occur. Nevertheless, the detective\u2019s throat wound is severe. He won\u2019t survive without treatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was some concern about rabies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I understand. However, that isn\u2019t a direct threat to life, given the incubation period of the disease; the blood loss is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was bleeding so badly, he ought to leave a trail even you could follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. He should have.\u201d The doctor\u2019s confused expression became even more so. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>The chaos increased when the police showed up.

I wouldn\u2019t be of much help. I didn\u2019t know the city. But I made Mueller promise to call me the instant they found Sullivan\u2014dead or alive.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I wandered up and down the streets of the French Quarter, hoping I\u2019d find him, but I didn\u2019t. By the time I returned to Rising Moon, dawn wasn\u2019t too far away. The club was still lit from within, though no music spilled out. Inside several stragglers remained.</p><p>King glanced up. One look at my face and he ordered, \u201cEveryone out.\u201d</p><p>The customers tossed money next to their half-empty glasses and left. I wondered if anyone ever argued, and if they did, what King would do.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDetective Sullivan was injured.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t plan on sharing the whole wolf, rabies, throat-torn, blood-everywhere deal. I wasn\u2019t even sure if I was supposed to.</p><p>King frowned. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left the hospital before he was treated, and now they\u2019re combing the city for him.

You look wrung out.\u201d</p><p>I was.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even think to ask if John had come back, left again, called, or anything in between, but as I passed the office on my way upstairs, the door opened. The man had ears like a\u2014</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure. Something with really good ears.</p><p>\u201cAnne.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in the doorway, his shirt buttoned crookedly, the tail untucked, his short hair as mussed as hair that short could get. His slacks were zipped but wrinkled, and his feet were bare\u2014pale and long, as elegant as his hands. The only thing neat about him was his well-trimmed goatee.</p><p>How did he keep that so nice anyway? I doubted King took care of it for him, but maybe I was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cWere you asleep?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He reached for me, and I went into his arms. I really needed a hug. He nuzzled my cheek, his mouth trailing softly to mine. He tasted dark, red, rich.</p><p>I pulled away. \u201cHave you been drinking?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, the expression both sweet and sexy.</p><p>\u201d Un p oco.\u201d His hand fumbled for mine, then found it. \u201cHave a drink with me, chica.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to say no, but in the next instant he seemed so sad, as if he\u2019d lost his best friend\u2014did he even have one?\u2014and I couldn\u2019t deny him a moment\u2019s companionship. Especially since, right now, I didn\u2019t want to be alone either.</p><p>A bottle sat on the desk. Cabernet. A very expensive one too. I couldn\u2019t imagine Rodolfo drinking anything else.</p><p>John pulled a coffee cup out of a drawer and curled his long fingers around the rim before tipping the bottle to pour.</p><p>Glug. Glug. Glug.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d I said.</p><p>I certainly didn\u2019t need an entire coffee cup full of cabernet. I\u2019d be on my ass before half of it was gone.</p><p>Although, considering what I\u2019d seen tonight, maybe getting sloshed wasn\u2019t a bad idea.</p><p>John handed me the cup, and I glanced into the depths. The swirling red liquid appeared far too much like blood. I swallowed thickly and set it aside.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not much of a drinker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d he said, then took a healthy swig.</p><p>I tilted my head. \u201cIsn\u2019t red wine at the top of the \u2018to be avoided like the plague\u2019 list for migraine sufferers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Didn\u2019t your doctor\u2014\u201d I recalled his reaction after he\u2019d been mugged to the idea of calling a doctor. \u201cDid you even see a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He took another large sip of wine. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know her.\u201d</p><p>A drop trembled on his bottom lip. His tongue swept out and captured it before it fell. I forgot what we\u2019d been talking about.</p><p>My throat was suddenly dry, and I took a sip myself. When I swallowed, my stomach flared with heat.</p><p>\u201cYou had a difficult night,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I was upset and confused. Sullivan was out there, hurt, perhaps dead or dying, and I couldn\u2019t help. I didn\u2019t know who, or what, had hurt him.</p><p>He was my friend, perhaps more. I was as confused about what I felt for Sullivan as I was over what I felt for Rodolfo. How had things gotten so screwed up?</p><p>\u201cThis place\u2014\u201d I began. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t articulate my thoughts. New Orleans was both mesmerizing and murderous, ancient yet modern, sometimes slow-moving and in the next instant frenzied. There was something about it that was reflected in both of these men.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a child in New Orleans\u201d\u2014John took a deep breath, let it out again on a sigh\u2014\u201dshe was so beautiful. This place was like no other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt still is.\u201d Of that much I was certain.</p><p>\u201cThe city is old. Older, I think than almost any. Some would say this makes her passe, but I think it makes her special. She has stood the test of time. She has weathered the plagues, the wars, the hurricanes, oui?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, captivated by his voice. He didn\u2019t sound drunk any longer.</p><p>\u201cSuch ugliness has come and gone and come again. I love this place,\u201d he whispered. \u201cShe is a part of me, and I don\u2019t ever want to leave her again.\u201d</p><p>I found myself crossing the floor, taking his cup and setting it aside. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>His smile was sad with the melancholy that often follows the happiness brought on by too much drink.</p><p>\u201cWe never know where fate may lead.\u201d</p><p>He had a point. I\u2019d come to New Orleans looking for Katie, and I\u2019d found him. What was supposed to have been a one-night stand, then a brief fling, had turned into something more. I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d be able to leave either when the time came.</p><p>I took his hand and turned it palm upward, tracing my thumb across the thin, white line. I never had asked him about it again.</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d I began, and he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome. My apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised my landlord I\u2019d give him the rent this morning, and\u2014\u201d He brushed a hand over my hair. \u201cI think you need some rest.\u201d</p><p>I did. And while I wouldn\u2019t mind forgetting about last night in this man\u2019s arms, I also wouldn\u2019t mind just forgetting everything in some deep, undisturbed, solitary sleep. Besides, it seemed a little\u2014rude?</p><p>Insensitive? Disgusting?\u2014to sleep with one man while mourning another.</p><p>I accompanied John to the door. All of the lights were off in the club. The place seemed deserted.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d King loomed out of the shadows. I started. John did not. I suspect he\u2019d known the bartender was there all along.</p><p>King stared at John for several seconds. Something passed between them, even though John could not know that King was staring. Nevertheless, he gave a nod, and the two of them left.</p><p>I stepped outside as they walked away. A strange haze swirled in from the river, thick enough, really, to be called fog. The two men went into it and were swallowed up almost immediately.</p><p>I stood for several minutes, letting the warm mist sift over my face. In the distance a horn sounded, one of the boats on the Mississippi calling out a warning.</p><p>I turned to go inside, and a voice drifted to me on the breeze. \u201cAnne.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cJohn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>I was certain I knew the voice. But the night, my exhaustion, the weird, swirling grayness, distorted it just enough so I wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Then I heard the growl, low, vicious, close. The hair on the back of my neck tingled. The hot, moist evening turned cold.</p><p>I should have run into Rising Moon and slammed the door. Instead, I remained on the back stoop, transfixed by the shadows flitting through the fog. Then one of them took shape, approaching from a different direction than the one in which John and King had disappeared.</p><p>A man, not a beast. One man, not two.</p><p>Someone I recognized, even before he stepped out of the mist. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>\u201cSullivan,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>The streetlight several blocks down reflected off the shiny green shamrocks on his tie, which hung loose against his bloody shirt.

I couldn\u2019t say I was sorry to see it go, however</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan grinned and I cringed. Had his teeth always been that sharp?</p><p>\u201cConner,\u201d I began. \u201cWe need to get you to the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>His voice was the same, except for the underlying gurgle that was more of a growl, which explained what I\u2019d heard rumble from the fog. Had the injury damaged his vocal cords? Had there been an injury in the first place?</p><p>Yes. The blood on him had been real, and I wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d seen him lying on the ground in a pool of it. He\u2019d been in an ambulance. According to Dr. Haverough, he\u2019d been dead.</p><p>\u201cAnne.\u201d He came closer, weaving a bit as if dizzy or ill. I guess dying could do that to a person.</p><p>I giggled a bit hysterically, and Sullivan paused, his head tilting like a dog that had heard something far, far away.</p><p>\u201cI feel so strange,\u201d he murmured, and fell to his knees.</p> <p>I rushed forward without thought, leaning over, meaning to help him up, then get him inside while I dialed nine-one-one for the second time in twenty-four hours. However, when I touched him, he snarled at me.</p><p>Seriously. He emitted the deepest, meanest sound I\u2019d ever heard. I snatched my hand back a millisecond before his teeth slashed the air where it had been.</p><p>His face was distorted. Foam flecked his lips. Were his teeth growing longer? If Sullivan himself hadn\u2019t told me rabies took one to three months to incubate, I\u2019d have been calling him Old Yeller by now.</p><p>As it was, my mind traveled more along the lines of An American Werewolf in New Orleans.</p><p>I reversed my steps as fast as I could while keeping an eye on Sullivan. There was no way I was turning my back on him even to run. I wished like hell I hadn\u2019t been so cavalier about the gris-gris. What I wouldn\u2019t give to have the small bag clutched in my fist right now.</p><p>My heel had just smacked against the first step leading up to the porch and into Rising Moon when Sullivan turned his face to the night and howled. The sound both fury and j oy, there was nothing human about it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t move; I could only stare in both horror and amazement as he changed.</p><p>His teeth lengthened; his mouth erupted outward, merging with his nose. The forehead receded as the ears shot upward.</p> <p>Bones crackled and popped. His shirt split; his pants tore; his single shoe seemed to explode. For an instant the streetlight reflected off glistening pale skin, then tawny fur sprouted from every pore.</p><p>His back arched; something rippled along his spine like an alien. Feet and hands metamorphosed into paws; nails became sharp, curved claws. The very last thing to burst forth was a tail. The appendage wagged, as the huge golden beast lifted its head.</p><p>Sullivan\u2019s eyes stared out of a frighteningly different face. The combination of the familiar and the foreign made me gasp, and his snout opened in a canine version of a grin. He was enj oying this.</p><p>He\u2019d spoken of a wolf with \u201cpeople eyes.\u201d The beast had bitten him, and now Sullivan was one too.</p><p>I\u2019d been pooh-poohing the idea of werewolves, but seeing is believing, because I had no problem with it now. My big problem was how to make him turn back.</p><p>He snarled at me again. The difference between the previous sound, which had come from a still- human throat, and this one, which had come from the belly of the beast, was the difference between a thunderstorm and a hurricane\u2014the first was disturbing, the second quite deadly.</p><p>I was captured by his eyes\u2014chocolate brown surrounded by pure white\u2014Sullivan\u2019s eyes in every way except one. Their expression.</p><p>I saw evil in those eyes\u2014hatred, lust, though not for my body, more for my blood.</p><p>He stalked me, pacing closer and closer, seemingly unconcerned that I might run inside, then shut and lock every door.</p><p>My mind flashed on the front of the building\u2014two huge windows through which the crowd on Frenchmen could view the lights, the music, the magic.</p><p>Mueller had said Alaskan timber wolves reached one hundred and twenty pounds. Sullivan in wolf form had to be close to his human weight of two hundred plus. He\u2019d have no trouble crashing through either pane of glass. I doubted even a door would keep him out if he wanted to get in.</p><p>From the look in his eyes, he wanted to.</p><p>Regardless, I couldn\u2019t just stand around and let him kill me, so I continued to inch backward.</p><p>He lunged; I shrieked. Stumbling, falling, cracking my tailbone on the steps and whimpering.</p><p>The wolf nuzzled my crotch. My knee twitched, clipping him on the snout. He shook his head and sneezed.</p><p>\u201cGet it over with,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>If he was going to kill me, then kill me. I was not going to be pawed, literally, by a werewolf. I had my limits.</p><p>His breath was warm on my arms, my chest, my neck. I realized I had my eyes closed and forced them open. Sullivan\u2019s stared into mine, making me dizzy. The eyes were his, but behind them was someone, make that something, entirely different.</p><p>He seemed possessed.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have time to dwell on the whys and wherefores; I was a little busy saying my prayers before dying.</p><p>Then another growl split the night. Sullivan\u2019s hackles went up, and he swung his huge head around, tossing spittle into my face.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see what was there until he clambered off me much faster than he\u2019d clambered on. Slowly I sat up and stared at the second wolf emerging from the mist.</p><p>He was smaller than Sullivan and his coat was thick and black. The eyes were light blue or perhaps green, even light brown\u2014but equally human. At this distance I didn\u2019t recognize them. And why should I?</p><p>I wasn\u2019t acquainted with all the werewolves in town.</p><p>The two wolves stalked each other. I\u2019d read somewhere that there were very few fights between wolves because of their pack nature. An alpha couple ruled the group, and all the rest were considered beta or subservient. However, it appeared as if wolves and werewolves didn\u2019t follow the same rules.</p><p>Another hysterical giggle threatened to break free, and I pressed my hand to my mouth to stop it. I didn\u2019t want either one of them to remember I was here. Although they seemed more interested in each other right now.</p><p>The black wolf rushed the golden one. They crashed together like battling deer, chests thumping instead of horns, teeth snapping, claws slashing.</p><p>Despite the difference in size, the black wolf landed the most blows. He appeared adept at the game, feinting, advancing, using his superior speed and agility to the best advantage. None of the blood flowing was his.</p><p>The fight was vicious; neither one showed any mercy.</p><p>The sounds were horrible\u2014the snarling and the tearing of flesh. The sight was worse\u2014teeth and claws, spittle and blood. I wanted to turn my head but was unable to. How many times in your life did you get to watch a werewolf fight?</p><p>I hoped only once.</p><p>The black wolf broke away and trotted a few feet toward the river. Though Sullivan was breathing hard, the second beast wasn\u2019t. He\u2019d done this before. Many times.</p><p>Then the black wolf charged, rearing up on his hind legs, claws flashing. When the blond beast did the same, he lunged, getting his teeth around the throat and driving forward. They crashed to the pavement together.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I cried, recalling that the lighter werewolf was Sullivan. I didn\u2019t want him dead, did I? Could he ever be put back the way he had been? Could he even be killed without silver?</p><p>I zipped my lips, but the black wolf had heard me. He lifted his gaze, though he kept his j aw clamped warningly around Sullivan\u2019s throat. I might not recognize his eyes, but in them I didn\u2019t see the madness I\u2019d recognized in Sullivan\u2019s\u2014none of the anger, the hate, the bloodlust. This wolf seemed different.</p><p>He released Sullivan, though he stood over him until the larger wolf looked away in a gesture of submission. When Sullivan rolled to his feet, he kept his gaze down, his shoulders hunched. He was beaten and he knew it. One low, rumbling growl from the black wolf, and Sullivan raced into the fog, tail between his legs.</p><p>Now that he was gone, I was uneasy. Did I really want a crazed werewolf, a possessed former human, running loose in the Crescent City? Maybe I should have let the black wolf kill him. Except the idea of allowing Sullivan to die without at least trying to find a way to cure him was something I couldn\u2019t do.</p><p>The black wolf hovered at the edge of the fog. Despite the bizarre human eyes, he was a wolf in every way\u2014wild, free, maj estic.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I murmured, and he tilted his head. \u201cJohn?\u201d</p><p>The name slipped out; I don\u2019t know why. The animal didn\u2019t howl in pain or morph back into a man. He continued to stare at me impassively.</p><p>\u201cJohn Rodolfo,\u201d I tried again.</p><p>He turned slowly and melted into the waning darkness.</p><p>\u201cOoo-kay.\u201d</p><p>The list I\u2019d found on the Internet wasn\u2019t working very well. Of course, what I should have done was call Sullivan \u2019s name. I was certain the blond werewolf had been him.</p><p>I put a hand to my forehead where an ache had begun. In the space of a few hours my whole world had changed. Werewolves walked among the humans; the dead rose, and I might just have to shoot one of my favorite people with a silver bullet.</p><p>If I could find one.</p><p>Sunrise sparkled through the fading fog. Time to shower, change out of my bloody clothes, and have another talk with Maggie.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t been in.\u201d</p><p>The kid with braids still worked the counter at the caf\u00e9. I\u2019d gotten the same answer when I\u2019d come and asked for Maggie yesterday. Today I wasn\u2019t leaving until I found out where she was.</p><p>\u201cHas she been on vacation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t shown up for her shift. Ain\u2019t like her.\u201d</p><p>Unease flickered in the pit of my empty belly. \u201cHas anyone gone over to her place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my department, babe. You want coffee or no?\u201d</p><p>I had when I walked in; now I doubted my stomach would hold it.</p><p>\u201cWhere does she live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot\u2014\u201d</p><p>I held up my hand. \u201cYour department. Got it. How about her last name?\u201d</p><p>He peered at me closely. \u201cYou like her or somethin\u2019 ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLesbo. Girl on girl. That why you wanna know? \u2018Cause I don\u2019t think Maggie swings that way, but \u2014\u201d He shrugged. \u201cTo each his own, I guess.\u201d</p><p>My headache was back. Caffeine would probably help, but I didn\u2019t have the time. I had a very bad feeling about Maggie.</p><p>\u201cName,\u201d I gritted out between my teeth.</p><p>\u201cSchwartz,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that you ask, I think I heard her say once that she lived near Tulane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I paid for half an hour of computer time, which was the smallest amount I could get, and found her address in five minutes. A short cab ride later, I knocked on the door of Maggie\u2019s apartment, hoping she\u2019d open it and be furious that I\u2019d woken her.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>I tried the door\u2014locked. Then I moved on to her neighbors, who, understandably, weren\u2019t too happy to see me at this hour of the morning.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d greeted the bleary-eyed, unshaven young man in 1-C.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to find Maggie.\u201d At his blank look, I pointed toward her apartment. \u201cYour neighbor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot girl?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how to answer that. Maggie had turned out to be a sweet kid, but hot?</p><p>\u201cDark hair, light eyes, snake tattoo,\u201d I supplied.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hottie. I\u2019d like to get me some of that.\u201d</p><p>Too much info, I thought, but kept the words to myself. He seemed to know her, at least in passing.</p><p>\u201cYou seen her lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His expression went from slack-j awed lust to confusion. \u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have a key to her apartment, or know who does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandlady.\u201d He j erked a thumb at the apartment across the hall. \u201cMrs. Fitzhugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, already crossing the frayed, stained carpet to knock on 1-D.</p><p>I repeated my query to the tall, thin elderly woman in curlers. People still wore those?</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen her.\u201d She punctuated the words with a loud pop of what appeared to be bright pink bubble gum. People still chewed that?</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t showed up for work in several days. I\u2019m worried. Could you open her door?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Fitzhugh blew an impressive bubble, popping it and folding it back into her mouth with a creepily pale tongue. \u201cYou a cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivate.\u201d I whipped out my ID.</p><p>She sighed, long, drawn out, and annoyed, but she got the key and let me in. Then she hovered in the doorway as I moved through the apartment.</p><p>Maggie wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>I\u2019d worked enough missing persons cases to know what to search for. No sign of a struggle. No blotch of blood on the carpet or the pillow. All good.</p><p>Her suitcase, backpack, purse, and toothbrush were all right where she\u2019d left them. Her mailbox was full; her garbage pail didn\u2019t smell minty fresh. Those observations, not so good.</p><p>I hit the button on her message machine.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Mrs. Fitzhugh protested. \u201cThat\u2019s not your\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped when the messages began.</p><p>Three from the coffee shop wondering why Maggie hadn\u2019t come to work. One from her mother wondering why she hadn\u2019t called. Two hang-ups.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you saw her?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Mrs. Fitzhugh had begun to look as nervous as I felt. \u201cTwo days ago when she left for work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see her come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She chewed her lip. \u201cShould I call the police?\u201d</p><p>I dropped Maggie\u2019s key into her hand. \u201cI think you\u2019d better.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>I left my card with Mrs. Fitzhugh in case the police wanted to talk to me. I was certain they would. Right now, I was too disturbed to wait around for them to show up. I had a feeling most of New Orleans\u2019 finest were still out searching for Sullivan. Maggie would be another missing person in an increasingly long line of them. They might not rush right over.</p><p>Besides, I had a theory about her disappearance and a burning desire to check it out ASAP.</p><p>So I went to Rising Moon, retrieved the file Sullivan had given me on the murders and disappearances, then returned to the Internet cafe.</p> <p>\u201cFind her?\u201d the kid behind the counter asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll have to open again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I took the chai tea I\u2019d ordered\u2014my stomach was not up to coffee\u2014and my computer card to the carrel that housed my favorite rental. I typed in the Web site address for the lunar calendar I\u2019d used once before.</p><p>I entered the dates that did not match up with a full moon, including the last night anyone, including me, had seen Maggie. The information tumbled onto the screen.</p> <p>\u201cI hate it when I\u2019m right,\u201d I muttered. The maj ority of the disappearances and deaths over the past six months had taken place under a crescent moon.</p><p>To be fair, that particular phase occurred twice a month and lasted several days. When it began and when it ended was fuzzy, unlike the single night of a truly full moon.</p><p>In addition, no one could be certain when some of the victims had last been seen or what day they\u2019d been killed. Nevertheless, the coincidence was too strong to be ignored.</p><p>Too bad I couldn\u2019t tell anyone about it.</p><p>Maggie was gone, Sullivan too. I didn\u2019t think it wise to mention to Mueller that there might be a loup- garou loose in New Orleans.</p><p>I\u2019d do best to keep my insane theories to myself. But I was starting to get disturbed by my diminishing roster of friends. Were they being killed because of me?</p> <p>Nah.</p><p>Then again, someone had lured me here with a doctored picture of Katie.</p><p>Concern for Rodolfo flooded me. I was closer to him than I\u2019d been to anyone else\u2014at least physically.</p><p>What if someone were stalking him even now?</p><p>I tapped at the computer and after a few cross-references found his address. The Internet was a private investigator\u2019s wet dream\u2014and if most people knew how easy it was to be found with a few simple strokes of the keys, it would be their worst nightmare.</p><p>I tossed my empty cup into the trash, returned the computer card, and left my number with braid-boy, just in case Maggie showed up. I only hoped she didn\u2019t show up with a tail and fangs.</p><p>I took a cab to Rodolfo\u2019s. His apartment was typical of those in the area\u2014business on the first floor, wrought-iron balcony with French doors on the second-floor apartment level. Some apartments had new windows, new paint around them, baskets of flowers cascading over the railings, droplets of water shivering on the blooms, then falling slowly to the ground.</p><p>Rodolfo\u2019s didn\u2019t. His windows were old, one was cracked, the paint was gray and peeling. There wasn\u2019t a flower to be had. Did the lack of home improvement mean he didn\u2019t plan to stay? Or that he just didn\u2019t care to waste time or money on something he couldn\u2019t even see?</p> <p>I rang the bell. It took him so long to answer, I was tempted to break the small window in the door and let myself in, but I was terrified I\u2019d find another empty house\u2014all of his things right where he\u2019d left them but no John.</p><p>So when he opened the door, sunglasses in place even though his shirt was unbuttoned to his waist, his feet bare and his beard more overgrown than I\u2019d ever seen it, I murmured, \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>He winced, as if the sunlight were too bright, then shrank into the shadows. \u201cGod doesn\u2019t come here anymore, chica.\u201d</p><p>Turning sharply, he headed up the stairs, leaving the door open, which I took as an invitation and stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a strange thing to say.\u201d I hurried after, nearly slamming into him when I reached the landing and walked into the biggest, emptiest living room I\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t much of a philosopher, but I still believed, as I always had, that God showed up now and again</p><p>\u2014usually when we weren\u2019t expecting him.</p><p>Which might be why I still hadn\u2019t felt his hand in my search for Katie. I expected God to help me. Why wouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cYou have to believe,\u201d I blurted. \u201cIn God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Now it was my turn to ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His lips curved. \u201cFirst you insist I believe, then you ask why I do? What brought this on? Or maybe I should ask, what brought you here?\u201d</p><p>I was uncertain what to say. I was all alone in this city. Did I trust Rodolfo enough to tell him what I knew? Or at least what I suspected?</p><p>\u201cAre you a werewolf?\u201d I blurted.</p><p>His dark eyebrows shot up from behind his sunglasses. I expected him to laugh, or at least be insulted.</p><p>Instead he answered me with complete seriousness. \u201cNo, chica, I am not.\u201d</p><p>I wished I could see his eyes, gauge his sincerity, but all I had was his word. I decided to take it.</p><p>\u201cI saw a man turn into a wolf last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour friend Sullivan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived here all of my life. I know people.\u201d He gave a Gallic shrug. \u201cThey tell me things. Sullivan was attacked by an animal. He seemingly died and rose again. His behavior at the hospital was rabid to say the least. I can put two and two together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe me,\u201d I said in wonder. I hadn\u2019t realized until that moment I\u2019d been afraid he wouldn\u2019t, afraid he\u2019d laugh, or worse, call the people with the big butterfly nets. Then again, I was talking about a man who frequently held conversations with himself in the dark.</p><p>\u201cYou asked why I believe in God,\u201d Rodolfo murmured. \u201cI\u2019ve seen great evil.\u201d His mouth twisted into a wry grimace. \u201cOr at least I saw it once, and if there can be such evil, such utter lack of God, there must be God, no?\u201d</p><p>He had a point.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t bitter because of\u2014\u201d I broke off, uncertain how to proceed.</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d He pointed to his eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d He smiled sadly. \u201cWell, maybe a little. But I have no one to blame for God\u2019s wrath but myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe you\u2019re blind because of God\u2019s wrath?\u201d Seemed a little Old Testament to me.</p><p>\u201cI believe God has every right to hate me, and that whatever punishment I receive is much less than what I deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d I began, but he held up his hand to stop me.</p><p>\u201cThere are things I\u2019ve done, Anne, for which there is no forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>Sunlight rained through a skylight and splashed bright light across his wrist, highlighting the thin, white line that marred his skin.</p><p>I crossed the short distance between us, took his hand and pressed my lips to the scar. He j erked, but I wouldn\u2019t let him go.</p><p>\u201cIs that what this was about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you tell me what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He yanked his hand away and slid out of reach.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t try to hurt yourself again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. I can\u2019t seem to kill myself no matter how hard I try.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a promise, but I suspected it was the best I was going to get.</p><p>\u201cBesides.\u201d He turned his face upward, bathing in the light. \u201cI have something to do first.\u201d</p><p>His words reminded me of my vow to find Katie. I wasn\u2019t doing a very good j ob. I\u2019d been distracted by all that was going on around me. I couldn\u2019t blame myself too much. Things\u2014I let my gaze wander over the long, broad line of Rodolfo\u2019s back\u2014and people had been mighty distracting.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come here today?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cI was worried.\u201d Quickly I told him about Maggie.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be around a long, long time.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound happy about it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help myself. I went and wrapped my arms around his waist and laid my head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou say God is punishing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone is,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cBut God forgives, John. That\u2019s what he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d His muscles tensed, rippling beneath my cheek and hands. \u201cI\u2019m less than special. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t finish, I prompted, \u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired.\u201d</p><p>Despair radiated off him like a fever; his shoulders slumped. I knew only one way to make him forget, at least for a little while, all that haunted him.</p><p>Reaching around, I slipped the last two buttons from their holes and his shirt fluttered to the floor. I traced a thumb along the ridges of his abdomen, swirled a finger around his belly button, then traced my nails just beneath the waistband of his loose, cotton pants.</p><p>\u201cAnne,\u201d he protested, and grasped my wrist.</p><p>I scraped my teeth across his shoulder, and he shuddered. I took encouragement from the fact that he wasn\u2019t pulling away. He could if he wanted to. I wasn\u2019t strong enough to hold him.</p><p>His skin smelled exquisite, like velvet midnight, summer wind, and man. He tasted even better when I opened my mouth and suckled the curve of his neck.</p><p>The grip on my wrist loosened; I took the opportunity to dip my hand lower and wrap my fingers around his erection.</p><p>My breasts pressed to his back; I wished I were naked too, but time enough for that later, when he\u2019d forgotten his name, let alone his belief that he\u2019d been marked by the wrath of God.</p><p>He swelled in my palm; his groan reverberated against my mouth still locked on his neck. I couldn\u2019t get enough of the taste of his skin. He began to pump his hips slowly forward and back, running his erection through the tight circle made by my hand.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, and I cursed my big mouth. Tightening my fingers, I increased the tempo. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I insisted, and ran my thumb over his tip. Moisture swelled, and my lips curved against his neck.</p><p>His body couldn\u2019t lie; he wanted me.</p><p>Maybe I should have felt bad about pushing him. Maybe I should have left him alone. But I believed he needed the connection to me as much as I needed the connection, right now, to him.</p><p>He turned in my arms, and suddenly we were face to face, my hand down his pants, his bare chest heaving . enticingly close to my mouth. I leaned forward and licked him.</p><p>His sharply indrawn breath sounded like a droplet of water tossed onto a griddle. I carved a moist trail from just below his collarbone to just above his right nipple, then I lifted my head, my breath coming faster, harsher, sending puffs of air across his skin. As I watched, the nipple hardened to a tight, brown bud and I flicked it just once with my tongue.</p><p>John backed up so quickly, my hand came out of his pants with a thunk as the elastic waistband was stretched and released. For a minute I thought I\u2019d gone too far, until he reached out with both hands and yanked my shirt open.</p><p>Buttons flew everywhere, pinging against the wall, the floor, his chest. I should have been scared, at the least annoyed, instead I was aroused. No one had ever wanted me as much as this man did. I wasn\u2019t sure if anyone ever would.</p><p>Frantic now, we tossed clothes right and left. His erection brushed my stomach. I made a yummy noise and rubbed against him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d He began.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start that again.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, short and so very sweet. \u201cI meant I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst one on the left.\u201d</p><p>The place was shrouded in shadow\u2014heavy, dark curtains covered every window. Day sleeper, like me.</p><p>As devoid of \u201cstuff\u201d as the rest of the house, the Spartan decor reminded me of a monk. His mattress lay on the floor; his clothes were folded in neat piles against the wall.</p><p>I tumbled onto the bed. He stood above me, silhouetted by the sunlight streaming down the hall. Even his outline was perfect\u2014the honed biceps, wide shoulders, slim hips. I shouldn\u2019t be so fascinated by his appearance, but I was.</p><p>Plain girls didn\u2019t warrant the attention of men so beautiful they belonged on a magazine cover. We</p><p>certainly didn\u2019t date them. We never got to sleep with them.</p><p>Unless they were blind.</p><p>Perhaps John was a rare breed\u2014a man who cared more for the person beneath the package. Maybe he\u2019d been that way even before he lost his sight. Maybe.</p><p>He moved away, fumbled a bit, found the door and slammed it, effectively removing the last bit of light from the room. I could only see a dark outline as he continued to stand while I lay naked before him.</p><p>What was he waiting for?</p><p>\u201cJohn?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of my voice, he tilted his head. He seemed to be staring at me from beyond the dark glasses, then he lifted his hand and removed them. A slight click split the silence as he set them on the nightstand.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see his eyes\u2014not a hint, not a glitter\u2014because of the lack of light, the lack of eyes, or had he merely shielded the ruined orbs with his eyelids once more?</p><p>With a sigh of surrender, he covered my body with his. \u201cThis is such a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d I arched, and he slipped inside. \u201cHuge. Mistake.\u201d</p><p>His hips flexed. \u201cHuge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Definitely.\u201d</p><p>His laughter tumbled over me like warm rain. Something shifted in my chest, and I caught my breath in wonder. Reaching up, I touched his face, traced my fingertips through his short, soft beard until my nails brushed his skin, and he stilled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Anne. Don\u2019t make this more than it can be.\u201d</p><p>Deep inside, the first tremors of an orgasm built. His arms trembled, as he stilled.</p><p>Determined not to let what we had fall away, I began to move, slow, sure strokes, sliding my body up and down against his. His breath came in short, sharp pants, as did mine. He couldn\u2019t help himself; he couldn\u2019t stop and as one we came together.</p><p>His cheek against my breast, my hand still on his face, I whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who said we always want it to be love.\u201d</p><p>He rolled until he was on one side of the bed, and I was on the other. \u201cIn my world, what we want the most is what we can never have.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>I made a move to get up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d John murmured. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>The \u201cplease\u201d got me, even though I didn\u2019t feel I should stay. How many ways did he have to tell me there could never be more than sex between us?</p> <p>Where once the idea of being wanted for my body had been a novelty, it had fast worn thin. I wanted to be wanted for myself. Who didn\u2019t?</p><p>As he\u2019d said\u2014what we want most is what we can never have. Ain\u2019t that always the way?</p><p>The room was dark and cool. I fell asleep, awaking an indeterminate amount of time later with a start to an empty bed. My ears strained to catch the slightest sound.</p><p>Was John still in the apartment? Had the rush of the shower, the click of the door, the tread of a footstep drawn me from sleep?</p><p>I wrapped the sheet around me and walked through the house. He wasn\u2019t there.</p> <p>Neither was very much else. I\u2019d noticed the minimalist decorating in the living room, the monkish state of the bedroom, but there was nothing personal beyond clothes and toiletries here at all. Not a picture, not a book, not a letter. No driver\u2019s license, birth certificate, passport, not a single slip of paraphernalia for tax purposes.</p><p>It was as if John Rodolfo had popped up in New Orleans out of thin air.</p><p>Maybe he had another house in a different city or state. Maybe he kept everything important there. But why? What did he have to hide?</p><p>The lack of personality, the lack of a past revealed in his living quarters only brought home to me once more that I didn\u2019t know enough about the man to trust him with my cat\u2014if I\u2019d had a cat. Why in hell was I trusting him with my body, my heart, and perhaps my life?</p><p>I had no idea; but I should stop.</p><p>I returned to the bedroom, flipped on the overhead light and got dressed, becoming severely annoyed when I realized I was surreptitiously checking the floor, the pillow, the bathroom mirror for some kind of note.</p> <p>\u201cPathetic,\u201d I muttered, then cursed when I tried to button a blouse that no longer had buttons.</p><p>What had been erotic earlier just pissed me off now. I stole what appeared to be a brand-new light blue T-shirt from Rodolfo\u2019s clothes pile, then let myself out of the house.</p><p>Night had fallen; the crescent moon hovered. The area around Rodolfo\u2019s apartment was not well lit or well populated at this time of the evening. I would have liked to take a cab back to Rising Moon, but there wasn\u2019t one to be had.</p><p>I hurried along, headed for the bright lights of Bourbon. I was probably paranoid, but I could have sworn someone followed me.</p><p>Whenever I moved, they moved with me. I only caught the pitter-patter of other feet interspersed with the thud of my own. If I stopped, so did the footsteps. If I turned, no one was there.</p><p>\u201cSullivan?\u201d I murmured, then bit my lip. Did I really want to meet him again, out here alone in the dark?</p><p>Stupid question.</p><p>The creepy-crawly sensation of being followed continued and by the time I neared Bourbon I was running. I flew around the corner and nearly smacked into a wall of teeming humanity. The place was packed\u2014curb to curb\u2014with revelers.</p> <p>I let out a sigh of relief and plunged into the mass of bodies. If someone, or something, was following, good luck catching me now.</p><p>The mounted police milling down the side streets, as well as making their way through the crowd, reassured me. From their exalted perch, they\u2019d catch sight of a wolf long before I did, and they\u2019d notice a crazy-eyed, rabid stranger even quicker.</p><p>I shook my head, laughing at myself. If this kept up, I \u2019d be the crazy person.</p><p>Then the mass of humanity parted for just an instant, and I saw ...</p><p>Katie.</p><p>Suddenly I was pushing people, shoving them aside, shouting her name, getting drinks spilled on me, some thrown at me. The crowd converged, blocking her out, and when it separated again, she was gone.</p><p>I stopped moving, staring at the place she\u2019d been. I closed my eyes, tried to remember her face, then the face I\u2019d seen. They\u2019d been different somehow, though I couldn\u2019t put a finger on exactly how.</p><p>Had that been Katie? I wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>After she\u2019d disappeared, there\u2019d been a hundred times I thought I\u2019d seen her\u2014in places she couldn\u2019t possibly be. I\u2019d heard that was common when you lost someone. The mind plays tricks; the heart tries to find a way to cope.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes. A horse stared me in the face.</p><p>I took several steps back, caught my heel on a crack in the sidewalk and almost fell. I was caught and tossed in the other direction with a good-natured shove.</p><p>The horse blew his opinion of my clumsiness from loose lips, spraying me with equine spittle. It went very well with the alcohol, orange juice, and soda spotting Rodolfo\u2019s blue T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>The mounted police officer peered at me. I guess I did look a little foolish, standing on Bourbon Street with my eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks. Do you see a blond woman\u201d\u2014I pointed\u2014\u201dthat way?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cI see a million of \u2018em. Wanna be more specific?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue eyes. Small, but curvy. She was wearing... red. Her hair is longer. I mean long. Midway down her back.\u201d</p><p>The officer was already shaking his head. \u201cAbout a thousand of those. You should scope out a meeting place ahead of time for when you lose your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I repeated, but he was already making his way through the crowd in another direction.</p><p>And I was late for work.</p><p>Sure, I would have liked to search the bars, the restaurants, the hotels, interview each and every person on this street, but even if that were possible, I wouldn\u2019t have. If the face in the crowd had been Katie\u2019s, she would have run to me as I\u2019d run to her. Instead she\u2019d disappeared\u2014just as she had three years ago.</p><p>I\u2019d seen a dream, a wish, perhaps a ghost. I didn\u2019t want to believe the latter; nevertheless, I was beginning to wonder. If Katie were alive, why hadn\u2019t she contacted me?</p><p>Though I\u2019d told myself I wouldn\u2019t worry about the bloody, dirty bracelet until we had solid evidence, in the back of my mind, I was more than worried. I was devastated.</p><p>Katie\u2019s blood type and graveyard dirt. I\u2019d never been any good at math, but even I could add that much and come up with dead.</p><p>Leaving Bourbon Street behind, I went to work.</p><p>King was having a hard time meeting the demands of the sizable crowd, but one glance at my soaked T-shirt, and he j erked his head toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cChange,\u201d he ordered. \u201cThen get your ass down here.\u201d</p><p>I did, but by then the police had shown up. Mueller again. I wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>\u201cDid you find him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Then understanding dawned. \u201cOh! Detective Sullivan. No. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can there be nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe city\u2019s pretty big, and he knew it as well as any of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s hiding?\u201d</p><p>Mueller took a deep breath and wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can live very long with a throat wound like that.\u201d</p><p>I bit my tongue to keep from mentioning that I\u2019d seen Sullivan sans throat wound. I\u2019d also seen him sans humanity, another tidbit I\u2019d just keep to myself. I was going to have to look for him; and I was going to have to do it with something sharp and silver in hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here about Maggie Schwartz,\u201d Mueller said.</p><p>\u201cDid you find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched, but he managed to keep a straight face. \u201cWhat do you know about Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met her at the cafe where she worked. We struck up a few conversations.\u201d</p><p>No way was I telling him what they were about. Luckily he didn\u2019t ask, which made me think he was new in the questioning biz. I certainly would have.</p><p>\u201cHow is it, then,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat you discovered she was missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the only one who cared enough to check. Her employer just assumed she was AWOL, even though she wasn\u2019t the type to miss work. I\u2019m a PI, Mueller, I\u2019ve done this before.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, seemingly satisfied, but then his gaze sharpened on something behind me. \u201cWhy is it that people around you have started to disappear, when before it was people around him?\u201d</p><p>I turned to find Rodolfo only inches away. From the tightness of his lips, he didn\u2019t appear to care for Mueller any more than he\u2019d cared for Sullivan.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it that New Orleans\u2019 finest can\u2019t find any of the missing,\u201d John countered, \u201cor turn up the slightest clue to a single murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d Mueller snapped.</p><p>The detective left after admonishing me to, \u201cStay available for questioning.\u201d I couldn\u2019t blame him for being angry and frustrated. Lord knows I was.</p><p>\u201cI had an appointment,\u201d John blurted. \u201cAnd you were sleeping so soundly I didn\u2019t want to wake you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t certain if his words were a compliment or an insult. I wasn\u2019t certain of much where John Rodolfo was concerned.</p><p>He turned abruptly and headed toward the performance corner, where he picked up the saxophone and began to play. The song was achingly slow, bruisingly sweet. Without a word, with only music, he made me want and need and love.</p><p>I\u2019d probably never get over him.</p><p>The rest of the night passed in a haze. With Mardi Gras so close, we were incredibly busy. John played almost frantically, as if he didn\u2019t want to stop, to think, to exist anywhere else but in the music.</p><p>Later he passed me on his way to the office. His hair was damp with sweat, his face paler than I cared for.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I took his hand; he was shaking.</p><p>\u201cI need a cigarette,\u201d he said, in a voice gone hoarse with exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted. \u201cBeen there, done dat.\u201d</p><p>I frowned as he slurred the last word. \u201cDo you have a headache?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, chica.\u201d He pronounced the words very clearly; he was trying too hard.</p><p>\u201cDid you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughed, and the sound was high-pitched, completely unlike the deep, sexy rumble I heard so infrequently. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure I will.\u201d</p><p>He twisted out of my grip and disappeared into the office. I couldn\u2019t help but follow, and as I neared the door, I caught the familiar sound of him talking to himself.</p><p>Though he\u2019d seemed better lately, with me, I wasn\u2019t a doctor or a psychiatrist. I had to realize that John might never be better, might never be normal\u2014whatever that was.</p><p>\u201cA little help here!\u201d King shouted, and though I wanted nothing more than to go into that office and demand to know what had happened to make John the way he was, I also knew he wouldn\u2019t tell me.</p><p>I returned to work. Later, when things had at last died down so that I could breathe, I went back. By then he was gone.</p><p>Morning came and with it a new determination. I needed protection that worked on both man and beast.</p><p>I found it at the same antique shop where I\u2019d purchased the iron horseshoe.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, that\u2019s real silver.\u201d The young woman manning the store today opened the glass case and removed the eighteenth-century letter opener. \u201cThey don\u2019t make them like this anymore.\u201d</p><p>I took the weapon\u2014uh, opener\u2014from her outstretched hand. The thing was needle sharp. I glanced at the price on the handle. And freaking expensive.</p><p>I pulled out my MasterCard. \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>On the way back to Rising Moon, I stopped at the cafe to see if Maggie had miraculously reappeared.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t.</p><p>I ordered coffee and a whole-wheat bagel, then sat outside for a few minutes. Someone had left a copy of the New Orleans Times-Picayune. I idly glanced at the front page, then grabbed the thing and stared at the picture of the man who\u2019d run out of Rising Moon with a knife stuck in his chest.</p><p>Jorge Vanez was found in the Honey Island Swamp. Authorities had been looking for Vanez in connection with an attack in an establishment on Frenchmen Street where Vanez had sustained a knife wound. However, his body was so badly burned it might be impossible to determine the exact cause of death.</p><p>My hands clenched on the newspaper, creating a loud crackle that caused the businessman at the next table to toss a frown in my direction.</p><p>There appeared to be a lot of charred bodies turning up in remote places.</p><p>Coincidence? Hell, no.</p><p>Sullivan had told me about a missing corpse turning up barbecued in St. Louis No. 1. He\u2019d thought voodoo was involved.</p><p>Damn, I missed Maggie.</p><p>No longer in the mood for a long, leisurely sipping of the coffee, I began to walk. When I reached Royal Street I turned down a path at the sign that read CASSANDRA\u2019S.</p><p>This time the priestess was in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>I was greeted by a tiny, dark-haired young woman with a startling white streak at her temple. She was wearing loose j eans washed nearly white and a red T-shirt that matched the polish on her bare toes. I figured she was hired help from Tulane.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d she said, as a surly wail rose from beyond the cascade of beads that shrouded the open doorway behind her.</p><p>Her smile was one of pure j oy even before a man stepped through with the baby in his arms. I couldn\u2019t help but stare. He was the most exotic-looking guy I\u2019d ever seen.</p> <p>His hair had once been brown, before the sun streaked it a hundred shades of gold. Tangled in the long, unruly strands were a few feathers and several beads, which clacked when the baby yanked on them. He laughed and the expression carved lines next to his misty gray eyes.</p><p>The hoop in his left ear brought to mind a pirate, as did the golden bracelet around his bicep. I didn\u2019t know what to make of him.</p><p>The baby was adorable, with dark curls and light eyes the same shade as his father\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cMa!\u201d he shouted, and reached for the girl.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been summoned.\u201d</p> <p>I blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re Cassandra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa!\u201d the baby reiterated.</p><p>\u201cYes. Cassandra Murphy.\u201d She smiled into the pirate\u2019s eyes. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to be unavailable until after Mardi Gras,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cClose enough.\u201d She tucked the child onto her hip like a pro and tilted her head. \u201cHave we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no. I\u2019m Anne Lockheart. I heard about you from Maggie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaggie.\u201d Her smile deepened. \u201cGreat kid. I haven\u2019t seen her in a while. How is she?\u201d</p><p>I tried to keep my face blank, but she knew. I don\u2019t know how, but she did. Her smile faded; her hands tightened on the baby, and he squawked.</p><p>\u201cDevon, take him.\u201d She handed the child to his father, who stared at me consideringly.</p><p>Contrary to his laid-back, beach-bum appearance, his eyes were sharp. His lean body and honed muscles made me think he did more than work behind the counter of a trinket shop when he wasn\u2019t taking care of the baby.</p><p>\u201cCome along then, Quinn, me man,\u201d he said with an Irish accent that sounded quite real. \u201cYou and your da will be havin\u2019 a bit of lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSchnake!\u201d Quinn announced.</p><p>I jumped. \u201cDid he say \u2018snake\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Cassandra\u2019s lips tilted, though her face remained strained and her eyes wary. \u201cLazarus.\u201d She indicated a chicken-wire enclosure in the corner.</p> <p>I narrowed my eyes. \u201cIs that a python?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood call. My met tet is the loa Danbala, represented by the snake.\u201d At my confused frown, she elaborated. \u201cA met tet is like a guardian angel. Snakes and I have an affinity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a voodoo familiar?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She spread her hands. \u201cQuinn is fascinated with Lazarus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose any little boy would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t seem to get his mouth around \u2018Mom\u2019 and \u2018Dad,\u2019 but \u2018snake\u2019 he can manage.\u201d</p><p>The child and his father disappeared through the beads and soon the clatter of dishes and silverware, the opening and shutting of the refrigerator, ensued.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Maggie?\u201d</p><p>Cassandra didn\u2019t waste any time. I liked that in a voodoo priestess.</p><p>\u201cShe disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to be going around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have any idea why?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She moved past me to the front door of the shop, locked it and flipped the sign on the window from open to closed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we step into my garden?\u201d</p><p>I followed her to a side door and through it into a lovely courtyard filled with plants and flowers. The faint sound of running water I traced to a fountain circled by a low stone wall.</p><p>Two chairs bordered the fountain. I could imagine Cassandra and Devon sitting there at the end of the day, watching to make sure Quinn didn\u2019t tumble in headfirst.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d she offered, and took one herself. \u201cWhy did you come to me?\u201d</p><p>I considered what to say and then didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Cassandra put a hand on mine. \u201cHave you seen something that can\u2019t possibly be true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a voodoo priestess. Knowing things is what I do.\u201d She sat back. \u201cTell me. I promise not to call the men in the white coats.\u201d</p><p>After taking a deep breath, I began. \u201cI came to New Orleans to find my sister. She went missing three years ago. Someone sent me a fake picture of her outside a j azz club called Rising Moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDigitally altered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wanted you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. What I don\u2019t know is why. I came to New Orleans to check things out and was directed to Detective Sullivan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSullivan?\u201d Cassandra snorted. \u201cHe\u2019s got his little paws in everything.\u201d</p><p>I j erked at the word \u201cpaws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I rubbed my forehead. \u201cThis is going to sound crazy, but the last time I saw him, he actually had paws.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra stilled. \u201cHell. I knew sooner or later his big nose was going to get him killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he wasn\u2019t dead, or at least he was walking around, talking\u2014not like himself, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you something. Did Sullivan have a little accident recently? Maybe get bitten by an animal of some sort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had a pretty huge hole in his throat. He said he saw a wolf and it had\u2014\u201d I stopped, unable to voice any further insanity.</p><p>\u201cHuman eyes?\u201d</p><p>Our gazes met and in hers I saw everything I needed to. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not crazy, Anne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know. I keep wondering, even when I see things myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone else know about this? Did Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I went to see her after Sullivan was hurt. She was already gone by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you meet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d been helping me research some things I\u2019d found. An altar. Small icons of animals.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra frowned. \u201cWhere did you find those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRising Moon. Maggie thought someone was placing a curse, or maybe trying to remove one. She also brought up the term \u2018lougaro.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Cassandra\u2019s expression sharpened. \u201cVoodoo werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said a lougaro could be anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A lougaro becomes a shapeshifter by choice, not through a curse or a virus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat virus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lycanthropy virus is passed through the saliva when the victim is bitten, causing changes in the</p><p>DNA.</p><p>Within twenty-four hours a human will become a beast\u2014day, night, full moon, new, it doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>The first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the change can only occur between dusk and dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the full moon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder any moon. Though under the full moon, werewolves must shift and they will kill. They can\u2019t help themselves. The lycanthropy murders their humanity; they become demonic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossessed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to know an awful lot about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had occasion to learn more than I ever wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about the legend of the loup-garou?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat do you know about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly what Maggie said.\u201d Quickly I shared what that was. \u201cDo you think she might have been killed because she told me? She did say anyone who\u2019d tried to write it down had wound up dead or missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be. Although she might have seen a werewolf or ten and decided to get the hell out of Dodge.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t thought of that. I liked Cassandra\u2019s explanation much better than my own.</p><p>\u201cSo there is a loup-garou in New Orleans?\u201d I pressed.</p><p>\u201cThere was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018there was\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast I heard he, it, whatever was behind silver-plated bars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>I told her about Sullivan\u2019s theory of a serial killer, his file, his notes, and what I\u2019d discovered about the deaths and disappearances as they related to the phases of the moon.</p><p>\u201cSullivan thought your boss was a serial killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been with him on the night of the full moon, the crescent moon too. Not a tail or a fang in sight.\u201d And I\u2019d seen pretty much all of him.</p><p>\u201cYou were with him from dusk to dawn, every minute on those nights?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWerewolves must only shift and kill under the full moon\u2014or the crescent if you\u2019re talking loup- garou\u2014once they do, they\u2019re free to turn back.\u201d</p><p>Rats.</p><p>\u201cAnything else about him that\u2019s odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s blind.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up. \u201cWell, that would preclude his being a member of the furry club of any flavor.</p><p>Becoming a werewolf heals most ills, including the one that killed you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d figured that out after my first glimpse of Sullivan\u2019s smooth, unmarred throat.</p><p>\u201cAlthough scars obtained before the transformation remain.\u201d Her brow creased. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould there be a second loup-garou? Or maybe just a werewolf who prefers the crescent moon to the full?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if I know. We\u2019re talking about werewolves here. Anything could happen.\u201d She bit her lip, thinking. \u201cSeen any other weird people who\u2019ve behaved badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a man at Rising Moon; he attacked John, that\u2019s my boss. Long story short, the guy ended up running out of the place with a knife embedded in his chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWerewolf,\u201d Cassandra muttered. \u201cIf the knife wasn\u2019t silver, it wouldn\u2019t even slow him down.\u201d</p><p>I fingered the package in my lap that contained the letter opener. At least I was on the right track.</p><p>\u201cOf course, if it was silver, then we have another problem altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonster,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cThere are more things on this earth than any of us realize, and some of them can\u2019t be killed with</p><p>silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I really want to know this?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Her lips twitched. \u201cProbably not. Did you ever see your \u2018should be dead\u2019 friend again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn today\u2019s paper. His body was found in the swamp burned to a crisp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back to werewolf again. Silver causes them to burst into flames.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t even surprise me. The question was\u2014</p><p>\u201cWho else knows about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean who knows enough about werewolves and silver to torch the guy in the swamp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make some calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes. \u201cAre you a secret agent or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something. Any more questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a million, but I doubt you\u2019ll answer them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said lycanthropy is a virus.\u201d She dipped her chin. \u201cIs there a cure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor some.\u201d . \u201cYou\u2019re beginning to get on my nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have that effect on a lot of people.\u201d Cassandra leaned forward. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019ll make a call. We might be able to help Sullivan, but we\u2019re going to have to catch him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatch him? As in trap, cage, get near his sharp, pointy teeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just slip some medicine into his Alpo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to my world,\u201d Cassandra muttered. After a few seconds she continued. \u201cYou said Sullivan came to you after he was hurt. Is there something going on that I should know about? You sleeping with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Cassandra quirked a brow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I wasn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>I lifted one shoulder, then lowered it again. \u201cI liked him. We have\u2014or we had\u2014a lot in common. He\u2019s a nice guy. Or at least he was before he grew a tail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe liked you too?\u201d</p><p>I remembered the times Sullivan had touched me, when we\u2019d kissed. \u201cYeah, he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is probably why he came to you. The virus may murder a person\u2019s humanity, snuff their soul, but there\u2019s always a little bit of their former self inside. Sullivan wanted you. Now that he has no scruples, he means to have you.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cHave me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexually.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened. \u201cBut he\u2019s a wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all the time, though werewolves do like it kinky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t wander around alone. You definitely shouldn\u2019t be out alone at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Fat Tuesday. Rising Moon is going to be so full of people I doubt even a wolf could squeeze in. I definitely won\u2019t be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, keep something sharp and silver nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d I withdrew the letter opener from its wrapping.</p><p>Cassandra\u2019s bright blue eyes met mine. \u201cI like a woman who thinks ahead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>Cassandra promised she\u2019d get back to me as soon as she heard something from her mysterious contacts in regard to capturing and hopefully curing Sullivan. I agreed to call her immediately should the detective show up in any way, shape, or form.</p><p>The streets were already crowded as I made my way down Royal and headed toward Frenchmen.</p><p>According to King, the best Mardi Gras started early and ended late. There would be dancing in the streets, food and music everywhere, public drunkenness, exhibitionism, and a general sense that the city had been taken over by the \u201cdegenerate of the day\u201d club.</p> <p>The tourists and the locals were adorned with rope after rope of plastic Mardi Gras beads in the traditional colors of green, purple, and gold. Many wore costumes. I passed a nun, a schoolgirl with very hairy legs, several Cleopatras, and two Charlie Chaplins. Quite a few wore masks\u2014some funny, some demonic, most decorated with an array of sequins, glitter, and feathers in every imaginable color.</p><p>King had opened the doors early. A local band already played, and the sun hadn\u2019t even set.</p><p>He shot me a glare and I hurried upstairs, trying to figure out how I would conceal the letter opener so that I could get to the weapon quickly if necessary but not hamper my working like a wild thing all night.</p><p>I could either tape the opener to my calf beneath a pair of loose cotton pants, or tuck it into a fanny pack at my waist. I chose the latter, figuring I would be able to unzip the compartment and yank out the sharp implement more efficiently than I could pull up my pants leg and free the thing from a wad of tape.</p><p>Concealed weapons were a real pain in the ass.</p> <p>There was no sign of John, but that was nothing new. He\u2019d either show up or he wouldn\u2019t. Tonight we\u2019d be busy regardless.</p><p>I could barely move between the bodies, had to pick and choose whom I listened to as drink orders were shouted whenever I went by.</p><p>I managed to introduce myself to the other waitresses and new bartender, who turned out to be imports from Biloxi. They came down for Mardi Gras every year, worked one night and went home several hundred dollars richer.</p><p>In order to stay as fresh as we could for the all-nighter we\u2019d be pulling, those of us working the floor decided to rotate fifteen-minute breaks every hour, which would allow us a brief respite every three hours. Better than nothing.</p><p>When it came time for my break, I stepped out back.</p><p>Tonight even the alley was full of people moving from one bar to another, congregating in small groups, cocktails in hand, enj oying the cacophony of music spilling from the open doors and windows of all the clubs on the street.</p> <p>People danced everywhere; they sang, they laughed. I couldn\u2019t help but smile as I allowed my gaze to wander over the teeming throng.</p><p>My smile froze at the sight of one woman standing apart from all the others. The mask covered most of her face, but even at the distance of several feet, I could see her eyes. They were both familiar and completely different.</p><p>\u201cKatie?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>My heart pounded too fast; I found it difficult to breathe. I didn\u2019t want to blink for fear she\u2019d disappear in the space of an instant.</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d descended the steps, begun to approach her, until she started to back away. I stopped; so did she.</p><p>Was it Katie? I couldn\u2019t be sure. My sister would never have worn a skirt so short, heels so high, or a blouse so low-cut. The dark circles of her nipples were plainly visible through the gauzy white material.</p><p>Her lips had been painted \u201cdo me\u201d red, the shade a stark contrast to the paleness of her skin and the luscious violet of the mask.</p><p>If this was Katie, why didn\u2019t she speak to me? Why didn\u2019t she throw her arms around me? Why didn\u2019t she behave as a long-lost sister should?</p> <p>The woman ran her tongue over her lips and smirked. That smile did not remind me of my little sister at all; it reminded me of some of the women who danced atop the bars on Bourbon Street.</p><p>I lunged forward, reaching out and snatching her wrist just as she whirled to run. Instead of j erking free, which was what I expected, she stilled, staring down at my fingers encircling her arm.</p><p>A wide scar ringed her wrist, as if she\u2019d been shackled and tried for hours, days, weeks to pull free.</p><p>Before I could question what had happened, where, how, why, or even to whom, she did j erk away, then darted into the crowd. Though breaktime was over, I followed.</p><p>She squirted through the melee with ease; whenever I tried it, any openings I\u2019d seen closed, any agreeable people became suddenly disagreeable. My murmured \u201cexcuse me\u201ds were pretty much ignored.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to give up. I couldn\u2019t\u2014even when the crowd thinned as we left the arena of music and laughter and traveled to one much sadder, darker, and infinitely more dangerous.</p><p>At first I thought I\u2019d entered an area where Katrina had done her worst. The washed-out buildings reeked of mold; despite the warm breeze, a damp chill permeated everything. The moon glistened off puddles scattered here and there. I trod carefully, afraid I\u2019d trip over a piece of wood, a tin can, a body.</p><p>But as I moved along I decided that the place was just empty and had been for much longer than Katrina could be blamed for. I wasn\u2019t sure why, although the haunted yet somehow desperate air of the place might have something to do with it. I wouldn\u2019t want to live here, even if they did bulldoze everything and start over again. Some places are just like that.</p><p>I realized I was watching my feet and not watching the girl; I looked up. By then it was too late. She was gone.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d</p><p>With a shriek, I spun. Catching my toe in a crevice, I twisted my ankle and stumbled. Sullivan scooped me up in his arms and carried me away.</p><p>I struggled but I might as well have been a fly in a web for all the good it did me. He just tightened his grip and went on.</p><p>The moon glinted off his eyes, making them shine an unearthly silver-blue. His hair had grown in the few days since I\u2019d seen him. No longer neatly military, it was now a shaggy mess. He didn\u2019t smell like sunshine anymore, but something darker, something that lurked in the shadows and only came out at night.</p><p>This was not the tidy man I\u2019d once been attracted to, but then, he wasn\u2019t a man anymore at all, was he?</p><p>Sullivan ducked into an abandoned building, and I suddenly realized we were alone. How could the masked woman have disappeared so quickly and so completely?</p><p>\u201cDid you see anyone?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Sullivan grunted. I waited for words to follow, but they didn\u2019t, so I tried again.</p><p>\u201cI thought I saw Katie. My sister? The one who\u2019s missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if he meant no, he hadn\u2019t seen her, or no, he didn\u2019t remember who she was or even no, she wasn\u2019t missing. From the expression on his face\u2014both dazed and slightly rabid\u2014I wasn\u2019t sure if Sullivan knew what he meant either.</p><p>I had to get out of here. Preferably before he raped me, definitely before he killed me or made me like him.</p><p>Unfortunately Sullivan had been a very strong man; he\u2019d be an even stronger non-man. I had a weapon, however, I wasn\u2019t ready, yet, to kill him.</p><p>He strode into one of the apartments at the back of the building. Moonlight streamed through a broken window; the glass on the concrete sparkled like diamonds. He moved into the silver stream, breathing in as if gaining strength from the light.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go over there?\u201d I pointed to a section of the room not strewn with glass, nearer the great big stick I planned to use on his head.</p><p>His eyes shifted to mine. There wasn\u2019t a speck of Sullivan left in them. I bit my lip to keep from crying out or maybe just crying. His gaze lowered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bite you till you bleed,\u201d he whispered, \u201cthen I\u2019ll lick you everywhere.\u201d</p><p>My resolve to keep him alive wavered. Sullivan wasn\u2019t in there anymore.</p><p>He kicked aside the glass, then lowered us both to our knees in the moonlight. His eyes continued to glitter with an unearthly sheen. Chill air feathered over me and I shivered.</p><p>Before I could inch my fingers to the zipper on my fanny pack and make a grab for the letter opener, he released the clasp at my tailbone and flung the thing against the wall. I was still gaping when he put his big hand into the neck of my T-shirt.</p><p>Screech.</p><p>He ripped it right down the middle, then yanked off my bra too. Between him and Rodolfo, I\u2019d be out of clothes in a few days.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you from the first time I saw you, but all you saw was him,\u201d he muttered, his gaze fastened on my breasts.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>He backhanded me. \u201cLiar,\u201d he whispered, and yanked me against him, pressing his mouth to mine and sucking the blood from my bottom lip.</p><p>I gagged, and he lifted his head and smiled. \u201cI like it when they cry.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out, he cupped my breast and squeezed hard. I tried not to react, but from the deepening of his smile, I didn\u2019t succeed.</p><p>\u201cGirls never liked me. I was too big, fat until I grew. They were always after the tall, dark, and broody types.\u201d</p><p>Well, that explained Sullivan\u2019s utter dislike of Rodolfo. Why did everything always go back to our childhood?</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll have all the pussy I want now. That\u2019s what my friend said. Anyone, any way, all the time. Tonight I want you.\u201d</p><p>He shoved me onto my back. The glass crunched under my ass. I spent a wasted second being glad none of my bare skin had landed on the sharp shards, then he was yanking at my pants.</p><p>\u201cI have to shift while I do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be an orgasm like I\u2019ve never had.\u201d He frowned. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t kill you. At least not yet.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the moonlight and his skin rippled, as if there were something beneath just waiting to erupt.</p><p>I began to struggle, disgusted and terrified.</p><p>He grabbed my hand and pressed it to his erection, which seemed larger than any human\u2019s should be. I cried out, and it leaped against my palm, growing bigger if that were possible.</p><p>Sure, I was frightened by the prospect of being raped; the idea of the act being performed by a man- beast didn\u2019t help any. But what really lent strength to my resistance was what I saw when I looked into Sullivan\u2019s face. He wasn\u2019t just insane; he was evil.</p><p>I\u2019d never been very religious. I believed in God, but Satan? Not so much. Until he\u2019d shown up in a gentle man\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Sullivan fell on me, his weight heavy, his penis hard, bruising against my pelvis. He hadn\u2019t managed to get my pants off or he probably would have rammed right into me. As it was, he kept trying, not seeming to understand the mechanics wouldn\u2019t work through two layers of clothes.</p><p>A low growl rumbled through the room. I gasped, afraid Sullivan had already begun to change. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d listen to reason then; I doubted he was capable of listening to reason even now.</p><p>Sullivan lifted his head from my neck where he\u2019d been snuffling my skin like a kitten that had just discovered catnip. His eyes flared; so did his nostrils.</p><p>He rolled off me, and I didn\u2019t wait another instant before scrambling the other way. I came to my feet just in time to see a flash of black fur as the wolf in the doorway charged.</p><p>Sullivan was still a man; he hadn\u2019t had time to shapeshift, although I could swear his teeth were protruding and his nose was too. As the beast flew through the air, Sullivan swept out his arm and sent it crashing into the wall.</p><p>I bit back a sound of dismay. The animal had helped me once before; I had no doubt it was here to help me again. Unless Sullivan killed him before he got the chance.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t easy to keep a good werewolf down. The black wolf sprang to his feet, shaking his head as if to clear it, then he began to stalk Sullivan, herding him toward the door and away from me.</p><p>Unfortunately, that was also the only exit. My plan to run away while the two wolves duked it out fell apart.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Sullivan shouted.</p><p>The wolf feinted to the right, then, when Sullivan\u2019s weight was tipped in that direction to block the attack, he suddenly shot forward and clamped his j aws into Sullivan\u2019s thigh.</p><p>Sullivan howled and pounded on the wolf\u2019s head with his fists. The blows didn\u2019t seem to bother the animal at all. He held on tight.</p><p>Blood splattered the cement floor, black beneath the light of the moon. Sullivan fell to his knees, and the wolf released him, backing away stiff legged, then inching in for the kill.</p><p>Last time I\u2019d kept him from finishing things. This time I wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>The dark wolf\u2019s head tilted as if he\u2019d heard something. He turned his back on Sullivan, who couldn\u2019t seem to do more than curse and hold his leg, then approached me.</p><p>I retreated until my shoulders hit the wall. My eyes met those of the wolf\u2014bright blue surrounded by white\u2014human intelligence in a canine face. But what confused me the most was their expression. This wolf\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t evil, and how could that be?</p><p>Before I could wonder more than an instant, he\u2019d spun away, racing toward Sullivan with a long, loping gait. The man cringed, trying to make himself as small as possible, which wasn\u2019t easy for someone of his size. The wolf leaped over him in a single bound, hit the ground once, and then crashed through what remained of the window.</p><p>Glass rained down, showering Sullivan with sparkling shards. He cursed and got to his feet, shook his head and sent the sharp crystals flying every which way.</p><p>Then he saw me, and the cloak of submission he\u2019d worn in front of the black wolf disappeared. Sullivan seemed to grow taller, wider, stronger before my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere were we?\u201d He reached for his zipper.</p><p>A muffled thunk split the night. Sullivan j erked. His roar of fury made me shrink back as if a gust of wind had rushed through the room, sweeping me along with its force.</p><p>His eyes rolled up, and he went down, with what appeared to be a tranquilizer dart buried between his shoulder blades. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>I stared at Sullivan lying so still on the ground, surrounded by glass and speckles of drying blood, then lifted my gaze to the shadow hovering in the hall.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t certain if things had just gotten better or worse, until the shadow moved, and the moonlight glinted off a pirate earring.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Devon Murphy knelt next to Sullivan and checked his pulse.</p> <p>Strangely enough, the first thing I noticed was that he\u2019d removed the beads from his hair, though the feathers remained.</p><p>\u201cAnne?\u201d Murphy snapped his fingers under my nose. \u201cYou hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour beads,\u201d was all I could say.</p><p>\u201cShock,\u201d he muttered. \u201cHappens every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked those beads. Why\u2019d you take them out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo hard to sneak up on werewolves when they\u2019re clacking away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Makes sense. You sneak up on a lot of them, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I\u2019d like.\u201d He set the dart gun against the wall and pulled his dark T-shirt over his head.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>He tossed the garment and it hit me in the face, then fell to the floor. He sighed. \u201cAnne, put on the shirt.</p><p>I\u2019ll attract less attention without one than you will.\u201d</p> <p>I finally realized I stood topless in the moonlight. I flushed and dived for the shirt as Murphy turned to Sullivan.</p><p>\u201cIs he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut for the count?\u201d He yanked the dart from Sullivan\u2019s back. \u201cYes. And he should stay that way for several hours. Long enough for me to get him in a cage.\u201d</p><p>Sense was slowly seeping into my brain. \u201cHow did you know I was in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been following you since you left our place. Cassandra wouldn\u2019t let you just wander around unprotected.\u201d He flicked a thumb at the man on the floor. \u201cYou were wolf bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t the nicest people in the world when it comes to taking care of business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s we and what business?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t tell you that.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWho can? Considering I was wolf bait, I deserve some kind of answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, but I\u2019m not in charge.\u201d Leaning down, he grabbed Sullivan\u2019s ankles and pulled him across the floor. \u201cMy truck\u2019s outside. Wanna give me a hand?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t plan to go near Sullivan ever again. He scared the living hell out of me. Which was so strange, since up until a few days ago I\u2019d felt safe whenever I was near him.</p><p>Luckily Murphy didn\u2019t appear to actually need my help; he dragged Sullivan into the hall. I followed, stopping at the door, then hurrying over to dig through the garbage in the corner until I recovered my fanny pack. I didn\u2019t plan to let the sharp silver instrument it contained out of range again.</p><p>By the time I j oined Murphy, he was lugging Sullivan\u2019s dead weight up a metal riser that reached from the ground to the back of his vehicle. Not a truck really, but a big white cargo van\u2014the preferred mode of transportation for serial killers everywhere.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes. \u201cWhat are you going to do with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d His voice was strained as he muscled Sullivan into the van, pulled up the riser, then closed the door.</p><p>The windows were tinted. He put a padlock through the handles and snapped it shut. I glanced in through the driver\u2019s side and discovered the back of the van was separated from the front by heavy fencing that appeared to be silver. Murphy didn\u2019t fool around.</p><p>I hesitated before answering his question. Did it matter? If we were talking about the thing I\u2019d just encountered in the abandoned building, he couldn\u2019t die quickly enough for me. But the man? He was worth saving.</p><p>\u201cHe can be cured?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Cassandra tells me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith voodoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t cursed; he was bitten. Voodoo won\u2019t help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a woman who has the power to put them back the way they were before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something spooky.\u201d</p><p>Once I would have classified Murphy with the crazies: now I wasn\u2019t so sure. I\u2019d seen a werewolf. Hell, I\u2019d seen two. Who was I to say some unknown woman didn\u2019t have the power to make things right?</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOn her way. We\u2019ll keep Sullivan at the Ruelle place until she gets here. She had an emergency to deal with first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her he\u2019s got a pretty bad thigh wound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was bleeding all over\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWerewolves heal, freakishly fast. By the time she sees him, he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Devon tilted his head, and his earring gleamed. \u201cHow\u2019d you get a lick in anyway?\u201d</p><p>I grimaced, thinking of Sullivan\u2019s threat to lick me all over. \u201cA lick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you wound him?\u201d he clarified.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. The other wolf\u2014\u201d</p><p>He tensed. \u201cWhat other wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack, blue eyes. You didn\u2019t see\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stopped. The thing had taken off before Murphy arrived, probably because he\u2019d heard Murphy coming.</p><p>Murphy\u2019s gaze swept the area. From the tension in his arms and chest, which I could see easily since I now wore his shirt, he was not only hyper-alert but nervous.</p><p>I followed his lead. The abandoned buildings were gray shadows against the indigo night. Nothing moved but us and the wind. If the black wolf was here, I couldn\u2019t see him. If the woman I\u2019d followed was around, I couldn\u2019t see her either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to call someone to take a look,\u201d Murphy muttered. \u201cI need to drop you at Rising Moon and get Sullivan to his cage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make it back on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get there quicker and safer with me.\u201d He lifted a brow. \u201cBut try not to let any more masked women lead you toward a horrific and bloody death, would you?\u201d</p><p>Well, at least he\u2019d seen her too. I wasn\u2019t completely delusional.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, lead me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was playing you, Anne; I figured she had good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of werewolves stick together. They follow the pack nature of real wolves\u2014even have an alpha, who\u2019s usually the one who made them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Sullivan\u2019s the leader?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s too new. There\u2019s a big dog.\u201d He grimaced at the terrible pun. \u201cI mean head werewolf, around here somewhere. We just have to figure out where and who.\u201d</p><p>He opened the passenger door. \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>From the set of Murphy\u2019s face and the firmness of his voice, I figured if I didn\u2019t obey, he\u2019d toss me in and tie me down. It was easier to get in. Besides, I didn\u2019t want to walk back to Rising Moon any more than I wanted Sullivan to wake up before he was locked in a cage.</p><p>I glanced warily at his still form behind the grate. \u201cAre you sure he\u2019s out for a good long while?\u201d I asked as Murphy climbed behind the wheel.</p><p>\u201cThe dosage on the dart was created especially for him. He\u2019ll be unconscious for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure he isn\u2019t dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing will kill him but silver.\u201d He started the engine. \u201cAnd another werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA werewolf can kill a werewolf, but it rarely happens. Some fail-safe in the virus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe black wolf tried to kill Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>Murphy frowned. \u201cThis black wolf is starting to make me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both.\u201d</p><p>Moments later Murphy rolled to a stop in the alley behind Rising Moon. The crowd had thinned markedly.</p><p>\u201cRodolfo must not be playing,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boss. The owner. He\u2019s a j azz musician. A very good one from what I can tell. When he plays, the place is a lot busier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call him?\u201d Murphy snapped.</p><p>I j erked at his tone. \u201cRodolfo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamous wolf,\u201d he said. \u201cRodolfo means \u2018famous wolf\u2019 in Spanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s his name. John Rodolfo. Someone else mentioned that it meant \u2018wolf,\u2019 but isn\u2019t that common with older names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore common than I care for.\u201d Murphy stared at Rising Moon suspiciously. \u201cWhat does your boss look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His eyes met mine. \u201cHumor me.\u201d</p><p>The seriousness of his tone, his face, made me do exactly that. \u201cAbout six feet, hundred seventy-five pounds. Dark hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery short.\u201d I rubbed my chin. \u201cGoatee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlind.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s blind. Wears dark glasses. I\u2019ve never seen his eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou going to tell me what this is about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever touched him with silver, just to see if he smokes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though his name means \u2018wolf in another language, that doesn\u2019t prove he\u2019s a werewolf.</p><p>According to you and your wife, people get that way by being bitten. His name was Rodolfo from the day he was born, nothing werewolfy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure that\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Sullivan checked him out. John\u2019s the last of a local family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey always are,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cYou know that not all werewolves are bitten.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThe crescent moon curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are others?\u201d My voice came out too loud and too high.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there are,\u201d Devon said calmly. \u201cYou need to be careful, Anne. This guy could be dangerous. He could be deadly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have killed me a hundred times, and he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d suspected John of being a werewolf too, which was why I\u2019d bought the horseshoe.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t touch him with silver, but I passed iron over his head.\u201d At Murphy\u2019s confused expression, I elaborated. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to reveal a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. But Sullivan was...\u201d I shuddered at the memory. \u201cPossessed. Even in human form, he wasn\u2019t right. John isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSad. Sweet. Haunted.\u201d</p><p>Something shifted in the rear of the van, and we both spun toward the sound. I expected Sullivan to be awake and slavering at the fence, but he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Nevertheless, I jumped out of the van lickety-split. \u201cThanks for the ride and the help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time.\u201d Devon reached under the seat and pulled out a gun. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>I took the weapon without argument. I wasn\u2019t foolish.</p><p>\u201cYou know how to use that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I just gave him a look.</p><p>\u201cRight. It\u2019s filled with silver. Should work on anything that breathes, and even some things that don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne?\u201d I lifted my gaze. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll use it if you feel threatened. There are beasts that roam the night...\u201d A shadow passed over his face. \u201cThey frighten me.\u201d</p><p>After my encounter with Sullivan, I didn\u2019t have to be told twice.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d I shut the door, then tucked the gun into my shorts, pulled Murphy\u2019s extra-large T-shirt over the top, and went inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>The band wasn\u2019t very good, which might explain why the crowd was thin. Or it could just be that on Fat Tuesday, Bourbon Street was the place to be.</p><p>King saw me the instant I stepped inside. His glare told me I\u2019d been missed. He made a sharp gesture that stopped just short of giving me the finger, but which I took to mean I\u2019d better come over and quick.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell were you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I thought I saw Katie.\u201d The truth slipped past my lips and tears sparked behind my eyes.</p><p>His anger fled in an instant. \u201cHey.\u201d King put his big, hard hand over mine. \u201cTake a breath.\u201d</p><p>I drew in a huge gulp of air and let it out again. With all that had happened tonight, I\u2019d pushed from my mind what had started my mad dash in the first place. Had the masked woman been Katie?</p><p>I didn\u2019t think so, and that made me want to cry all the more.</p><p>\u201cGo on upstairs.\u201d King began to wipe down his already pristine bar. \u201cWe\u2019re good here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sure? I can take over for one of the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. They want to make as much money as they can before they go home. Besides, Johnny was lookin\u2019</p><p>for you. I think he\u2019s in the back.\u201d</p><p>I thanked King with a tired smile and headed for the office. But a quick glance inside, even after I\u2019d turned on the lights, revealed an empty room, so I went up the stairs\u2014first one flight, then two.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t in the attic room either. He\u2019d no doubt gotten tired of waiting and left.</p><p>Disappointment flooded me. Maybe I\u2019d just change clothes and follow.</p> <p>I unlocked my door, snapped on the lights, and, removing Murphy\u2019s gun from the waistband of my shorts, shoved it into the nightstand drawer, then laid my fanny pack on top.</p><p>Turning around, I gasped. Rodolfo stood just inside the room. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, just shut the door and flicked the lock.</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d I began, but with his unerring sense of direction, he crossed the floor and took me into his arms.</p><p>He was shaking and my heart stuttered. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne,\u201d he murmured against my hair. \u201cAnne.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem capable of saying anything else. In truth, I didn\u2019t mind. I hadn\u2019t realized how much I needed to be held. The violent encounter with Sullivan had confused, frightened, and exhausted me. I started to shake too.</p><p>John lifted his head, brushed his lips across my brow, touched my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re freezing. Come on.\u201d</p> <p>He led me toward the bathroom, one hand around my wrist, the other stretched in front of him. Once there, he released me to turn on the hot water. After testing it, he put in the stopper and straightened.</p><p>\u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>Despite the heat of the night, the lingering shock had chilled me. I was also beginning to ache from being thrown around like a rag doll by a lust-crazed werewolf. I wanted to sink into the warm water, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stepped into the bedroom and closed the door.</p><p>I stripped and jumped into the tub, nearly groaning at how good it felt. I lay back and closed my eyes, but as soon as I did, I saw Sullivan as he\u2019d been tonight, heard the echo of his words, felt again his bruising hands.</p><p>My eyes snapped open. \u201cJohn?\u201d</p><p>The door opened an inch. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you... come in? Talk to me?\u201d</p><p>The door opened wider. \u201cYou\u2019re not all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>I was mortified at how not all right I was. I didn\u2019t want to be alone, which was not a good thing for a single woman to want. What would I do if I suddenly became afraid of the dark?</p><p>John sat on the edge of the tub. If it had been anyone else, I might have been embarrassed to be naked in the water, but he couldn\u2019t see me. He\u2019d never see me. There was a comfort in that.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me to death, querida.\u201d</p><p>Querida? My Spanish wasn\u2019t good, but I thought the word an endearment. I didn\u2019t want to ask, just in</p><p>case it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the waitresses said you ran into the crowd. Then you didn\u2019t come back and I couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d He broke off, tilting his head until the lights bounced off his sunglasses like a flare. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go after you, Anne. I couldn\u2019t protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to protect me.\u201d</p><p>Big, f at liar. If Murphy hadn\u2019t been there\u2014</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to think about that now; though I had no doubt I\u2019d be thinking about it a lot in the nights to come.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t going to share the experience with John. Sometimes a lie was the best policy. He was already upset enough; telling him I\u2019d almost been raped by a werewolf... What good would it do?</p><p>His head lowered, and he seemed to be looking at me, although the lights still reflected in the dark lenses like sunbursts.</p><p>He trailed his long, supple fingers through the water, creating a current that swirled against my neck, down my breasts, over my stomach, and across my thighs. I caught my breath as my body came alive.</p><p>What was it about this man that made me feel things I never had before? Things I was afraid I\u2019d never feel again, with anyone else but him?</p><p>\u201cRelax, querida.\u201d The way he murmured the word was itself a caress. I didn\u2019t care if he was calling me</p><p>\u201cpig face,\u201d as long as he said it like that. \u201cLay back, close your eyes. No one will hurt you when I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>I heard the contradiction, even as my eyes fluttered closed. In one breath he said he couldn\u2019t protect me, in the next he said no one would hurt me.</p><p>But I\u2019d seen John in action; he\u2019d fought a crazy guy with a knife and won. Though the sense of safety Sullivan\u2019s presence had once brought was gone, and I doubted I\u2019d ever get it back, I felt safe now, with John.</p><p>He continued to draw his fingers along the surface of the water, just enough to make the liquid swirl. I was both relaxed and aroused. The heat made me languid; the water made me moist. His presence made me hot, as usual.</p><p>His fingers trailed lower and lower. My breasts ached for the touch long before it came. Skin against skin, I needed it like I needed my next breath. Finally I arched, and his palm cupped the fullness, his thumb stroked my nipple beneath the surface of the water. I sighed and let my legs drift open, relishing the lap of the current between them.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t seem to stop myself from touching you,\u201d he whispered, \u201ceven though I know I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes, startled at the sight of myself reflected in his lenses. I looked so erotic in the water, my skin pale, his fingers dark against my thigh.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d I said, and watched the tendons in his hand flexing and releasing as he stroked.</p><p>I reveled in combination of the gently flowing water, the eddies swirling past my breasts, my belly, the press of his thumb against me as one finger slid in and out of my body. My eyes wide open, I watched myself in his sunglasses, feeling, not for the first time, as if he were watching me too.</p><p>I rose from the water like a serpent, a nymph, a goddess\u2014I don\u2019t know, something magical. I was prepared to yank off his clothes and do him on the slippery tile floor of the bathroom, but he wasn\u2019t so crass. He evaded my grasp, tossing me a towel, then leading me into the bedroom, as he dropped his own clothes like the proverbial trail of bread crumbs.</p><p>I could see nothing. He\u2019d shut off the lights; the curtains were drawn, this hour the darkest in every twenty-four, when the moon falls and the sun has not yet risen.</p><p>The bed creaked with his weight, the sound drawing me onto the mattress.</p><p>I\u2019d been perched on the edge of orgasm, but the slight chill of the room, the few minutes it had taken to get from there to here, had cooled me. One touch of his tongue to my breast and everything came back, stronger than before.</p><p>I could smell him, hear him, but I couldn\u2019t see him, and the not-seeing increased the anticipation, made the intimacy more compelling. No wonder he was so good at sex. With only touch, scent, taste but no sight, the senses left behind were almost painful in their intensity.</p><p>In every brush of his hand lay the gentleness of an artist; with every nudge of his mouth, I relished the slight scrape of his goatee that surrounded the incredible softness of his lips, the sharp nip of his teeth.</p><p>His hair but a whisper, the slide of his glasses was both hard and smooth. He rubbed his face against the underside of my breast, breathing in as if memorizing the essence of me before taking my nipple into his mouth and suckling as if he\u2019d draw me into his very soul.</p><p>I tangled my fingers in his hair and urged him on, the pull of his lips, the press of his tongue, seeming to start an answering contraction within so that when he rose above me the first thrust of his hips, the weight of his body over mine, had me both opening to him and closing in on myself, savoring the pleasure, the wonder, the blessed gift of this moment when it was just the two of us together in a way we could never be with anyone else.</p><p>I had to feel him closer, deeper. My legs over his hips wasn\u2019t enough, I lifted them higher, locking my ankles behind his neck as he gripped my buttocks and found a rhythm that had me moaning in both surprise and shock as sensations I\u2019d never experienced before washed over me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, and then he was pulsing, coming, causing an answering wave in me.</p><p>My legs slid bonelessly down his shoulders as we held each other, shuddering together until it was done.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d I ran my hand from the crown of his head, along the slope of his back, my fingers coming to rest at the base of his spine. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait either.\u201d</p><p>He began to roll away and I held on. \u201cStay. Please.\u201d</p><p>I thought he\u2019d argue, at least shift to the side, remove his weight, at the most get up, get dressed, walk away. Instead he remained buried inside me, toe to toe, hip to hip, cheek to cheek, the drift of his breath stirring my hair, tickling my ear, making my lips curve and my heart flutter.</p><p>I must have fallen asleep because I woke alone, though the bed was still warm next to me. A knock sounded on the door. John must have gone downstairs for\u2014I don\u2019t know what\u2014and now he couldn\u2019t get back in.</p><p>The clothes I\u2019d worn the night before were folded on my dresser; the fanny pack lay on top. Weird. How long had I been sleeping for John to have tidied the place before stepping out?</p><p>I grabbed some clean underwear, threw on a T-shirt and shorts, then picked up the fanny pack, carrying it with me as I opened the zipper and checked to make sure the silver letter opener remained inside. It did.</p><p>I opened the door, blinking in the sudden flare of light from the hall.</p><p>At first I thought the man was John, except he had long hair, a clean-shaven face, and very familiar blue eyes.</p><p>I blinked, staring into his face, unable at first to remember why I knew him, or at least why I knew those eyes.</p><p>And then it hit me.</p><p>I\u2019d seen them on several occasions\u2014staring back at me from the face of a great black wolf.</p><p>I cried out, stumbling back, somehow having the presence of mind to yank the letter opener free of the fanny pack and hold it in front of me like the weapon it was.</p><p>Sure, the black wolf had saved me from Sullivan on two occasions, but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t here to kill me. According to anyone who knew anything about werewolves, they were evil, murdering machines</p><p>\u2014and there was one of them in front of me now.</p><p>He stepped inside, flicked on the light, then shut the door behind him. My gaze lifted, then lowered. He\u2019d walked right under the horseshoe and hadn\u2019t even noticed it was there. What a waste of money.</p><p>His mouth twisted wryly at the sight of the letter opener clutched in my hand. \u201cDe silver doesn\u2019t work on me.\u201d</p><p>He had a pronounced Cajun accent. The last time I\u2019d heard one that sexy I\u2019d been drooling over Dennis Quaid in The Big Easy . I never had stopped lusting after the man, throughout countless less wondrous movies.</p><p>I shook my head. Now was not the time for an Ebert &amp; Roeper flashback.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a\u2014a--\u201d I couldn\u2019t get the word out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cLoup-garou?\u201d he supplied, inching nearer with every passing second.</p><p>He was close enough to touch, so I pressed the flat of the silver opener against his arm.</p><p>Nothing happened\u2014until he snatched it right out of my hand.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>The man flipped the opener end over end, catching it by the handle. I shuddered when those too familiar blue eyes met mine. The sharp silver implement would work on humans as well as werewolves. All he had to do was shove it into a vital organ and twist. I began to back toward the nightstand where Murphy\u2019s gun was hidden.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for de loup-garou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m as human as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not a loup-garou, then who is?\u201d The bathroom door opened and I whirled in that direction.</p><p>John Rodolfo stood in the doorway. \u201cHello, Grandp\u00e8re,\u201d said the blue-eyed man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>\u201cGrandpa?\u201d I repeated, glancing at the guy behind me, who kept his eyes fixed on John.</p><p>\u201cTell her,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>My gaze went to Rodolfo. He continued to lean in the doorway, his slumped shoulders proj ecting exhaustion, even as the tilt of his head broadcast awareness of every movement and word.</p> <p>There was something familiar about him. I looked at the other man. With shorter hair, a goatee, and sunglasses, he would be John\u2019s twin. What was going on?</p><p>\u201cFirst things first.\u201d I j abbed a finger at the intruder. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>His bright blue eyes flicked to John, then back to me. \u201cAdam Ruelle.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. I\u2019d heard that name recently.</p><p>\u201cYour friend Sullivan is a guest of my dungeon,\u201d he continued.</p> <p>\u201cDungeon?\u201d My voice squeaked.</p><p>\u201cI mean cage. Big one. Silver bars.\u201d</p><p>That explained why I knew the name but not much else. \u201cHow did you get in here and, more importantly, why?\u201d</p><p>His lips tilted. Not a smile, but close. I wondered if the man ever truly smiled, which gave him a lot in common with John.</p><p>\u201cI was once in de army,\u201d he said. \u201cI did a lot of breaking and entering in places where, if they caught me, I\u2019d wish I were dead long before I was.\u201d</p><p>Translation: hush-hush, Special Forces stuff. The locks on Rising Moon, and on my bedroom door for that matter, would have been child\u2019s play to a guy like him.</p> <p>\u201cOnce I spoke with Murphy,\u201d he continued, \u201cand I heard de name Rodolfo, I had to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRodolfo means \u2018famous wolf\u2019 in Spanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems to be the consensus,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cRuelle means \u2018famous wolf\u2019 in French.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s at de heart of our curse. The reason man turns into wolf and not alligator, snake, hedgehog. Names have power.\u201d</p><p>I must have been staring at him blankly\u2014could you blame me?\u2014because he continued to explain.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of de loup-garou? Our crescent moon curse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the highlights.\u201d</p><p>He swept out his hand. \u201cMeet de cursed one.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at John. He continued to stand immobile, everything he felt and thought hidden behind those damnable glasses.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen a man turn into a wolf. Nothing\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>Memories flickered\u2014of John telling me he\u2019d been touched by God\u2019s wrath. If that wasn\u2019t a curse, I don\u2019t know what was. I still couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cI asked you if you were a werewolf,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cYou said you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a loup-garou.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he is,\u201d Adam snapped. \u201cYou think if he murders de innocent night after night, year after year, century after century, he\u2019d balk at lying?\u201d</p><p>I rounded on Adam. \u201cWhy do you know so damned much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cursed too. Or I will be if Grandp\u00e8re ever dies. I become a loup-garou and my son after me and so on until de end of time, or we break this curse.\u201d He sighed. \u201cMy money\u2019s on de end of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me John is your grandfather\u201d\u2014I glanced back and forth between the two of them \u2014\u201deven though he looks young enough to be your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks deceive. He was born in eighteen thirty, died de first time in eighteen fifty-eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name isn\u2019t even Ruelle.\u201d I grasped any excuse to refute this claim. \u201cIt\u2019s Rodolfo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Adam said, \u201cit isn\u2019t. He took another name when he came back here. What I don\u2019t understand is why?\u201d His gaze went to John\u2014or whatever his name was. \u201cWhy would you come to New Orleans, Grandp\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit calling him that!\u201d I snapped.</p><p>Hearing a man who appeared thirty years old calling another who appeared of equal age \u201cGrandpa\u201d</p><p>made me want to shriek mindlessly until my mind snapped, if it hadn\u2019t already.</p><p>\u201cShould I call him by de name he was born with?\u201d Adam asked. \u201cHenri,\u201d he said, pronouncing the name in the French manner, dropping the h, putting the accent on the second syllable. \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t be who you say he is,\u201d I put in desperately. \u201cCassandra told me any afflictions heal once a person becomes a werewolf. He\u2019s blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Adam murmured. \u201cHe isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Slowly John straightened away from the doorj amb, lifting his hand to his sunglasses, then removing them.</p><p>I\u2019d wished countless times that I could see the color or the expression of his eyes. Now I could.</p><p>They were blue; they were agonized, and they were no more blind than mine were.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I turned away. \u201cWhy pretend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t want anyone to recognize him, or me as de case may be,\u201d Adam said. \u201cNo one would suspect him either. A blind man can\u2019t be a murderer.\u201d</p><p>I flinched. I\u2019d said as much to Sullivan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a murderer.\u201d John\u2019s voice was low and furious.</p><p>Adam snorted. \u201cGrandp\u00e8re, you\u2019re one of de most vicious beasts in history. Angelus has nothing on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngelus?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201d Buffy the Vamp ire Slayer,\u201d I murmured absently. \u201cTelevision show\u2014hot guy, vicious vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWerewolf. Vampire. What\u2019s the difference?\u201d I threw up my hands. \u201cYou kill people, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s eyes met mine. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are dying all over de place,\u201d Adam interj ected. \u201cYou expect me to believe you aren\u2019t involved?\u201d</p><p>John rubbed his forehead. I kept getting distracted by the blue of his eyes. Hell, just seeing his eyes was such a novelty I couldn\u2019t get past it.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d He dropped his hand and leaned back against the wall. \u201cI\u2019m not killing p eop le.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m killing werewolves. They aren\u2019t people anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd neither are you,\u201d Adam murmured.</p><p>Suddenly the room was hot; I was dizzy. I\u2019d had sex with this man, only he wasn\u2019t a man. Not really.</p><p>I ran into the bathroom and threw up.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d eaten. When I was done with the dry heaves, I levered myself to my feet and saw John hovering.</p><p>\u201cBack off.\u201d I doused my head with cold water, then brushed my teeth.</p><p>My mind raced, trying to remember all that had happened in New Orleans, all that I\u2019d heard and learned.</p><p>I came out of the bathroom to discover Adam and John on opposite sides of the room. Adam appeared</p><p>contrite. \u201cThis is a lot to take in.\u201d</p><p>I just glared at him, then I turned the evil eye on his grandp \u00e8re. \u201cSullivan said he recognized the eyes of the wolf that attacked him; from the very beginning something about you bothered him.\u201d</p><p>I paused, considering that John might have killed Sullivan because of me. How many times had he come in the room when the detective had been touching me, whispering to me, had John even seen us kiss?</p><p>He\u2019d never seemed j ealous; but then, he hadn\u2019t seemed evil either.</p><p>I pulled my attention back to the big question. \u201cWas that why you killed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been making new wolves,\u201d John insisted. \u201cI\u2019ve been killing the old ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I should believe you because you\u2019ve been so truthful up to this point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Henri?\u201d Adam repeated.</p><p>\u201cMy name is John now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can call yourself by any name you like, but it doesn\u2019t change who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d John\u2019s voice broke on the last word. \u201cI hear them shrieking. Hundreds upon hundreds haunt me. It doesn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m different now, they won\u2019t let me rest.\u201d</p><p>I remembered his headaches, his nightmares, the times I\u2019d heard him talking to himself in the dark.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by different?\u201d I asked.</p><p>The two men exchanged glances, and John dipped his chin. Adam turned to me. \u201cOnce bitten, or cursed, humans are possessed by a demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Or at least that was what I\u2019d been told, and my firsthand observations of the changes in Sullivan had made me believe.</p><p>I stared into John\u2019s eyes. I saw many things, some of them frightening but none of them evil.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why we captured Sullivan,\u201d I murmured, turning to Adam. \u201cSo why isn\u2019t John cured?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t call him Henri; I just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cBecause he was cursed and not bitten de demon was removed, but de need to shift and to kill remained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling werewolves takes care of the hunger,\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the fail-safe in the virus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about it?\u201d Adam demanded.</p><p>\u201cMurphy was chatty.\u201d</p><p>Adam rolled his eyes. \u201cHe always is. As near as we can figure, being cursed or cured or having de normal process of being a werewolf screwed up in some way throws de fail-safe out of whack. It\u2019s happened before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain I have to ask why you know so freaking much about this and just who the hell is \u2018we\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Adam shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what, you\u2019d have to kill me?

Adam had discarded the letter opener. I scooped it up and swooped it toward John\u2019s arm.</p><p>The scent of burning hair and flesh made me drop the weapon. As it clattered to the ground between us, smoke curled upward.</p><p>He stared at me impassively. \u201cYou believe me now?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t speak, could only stare at the white scar on his forearm. \u201cI thought all wounds healed once you were a werewolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless they\u2019re made with silver.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out, I turned John\u2019s palm over and stared at the thin white line across his wrist. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-one</p><p>\u201cWhat de hell?\u201d Adam demanded, and grabbed John\u2019s arm himself. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have that when you went to Montana.\u201d</p><p>John pulled out of Adam\u2019s grasp and moved to the window without answering.</p><p>\u201cDid someone tie you with silver wire?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d John still faced in the other direction.</p><p>\u201cYou tried to kill yourself with a silver knife,\u201d I blurted.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d Adam pulled at his hair. \u201cStupid question.\u201d He took a deep breath, let it out, seemed to be working on calming down and failing. \u201cWhat if you\u2019d succeeded? You would pass your curse to me?</p><p>To Luc? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve changed, old man, you\u2019re de exact same selfish prick you were a hundred and fifty years ago.\u201d</p><p>Hearing Adam call John \u201cold man\u201d would have been funny, except nothing seemed funny anymore.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking clearly at the time,\u201d John said. \u201cIt was right after\u2014\u201d He rubbed a thumb along the thin white line. \u201cWhen the voices were the loudest.

For now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not clear on how the curse would pass from John to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Grandp\u00e8re dies,\u201d Adam said, \u201cI am cursed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of the blue one night, bam\u2014suddenly you\u2019re a werewolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happened to me,\u201d John said softly.</p><p>\u201cExcept it wasn\u2019t out of de blue.\u201d Adam\u2019s lip curled. \u201cYou deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems a little far-fetched,\u201d I murmured.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s magic,\u201d Adam snapped. \u201cNot logic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be certain the curse will pass to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan on killing him just to see.\u201d He glared at John. \u201cAlthough I have been tempted on more than one occasion. You never told me why you came back to New Orleans, Grandp\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him to.\u201d</p><p>The voice from the hall made me jump a foot, but I recognized the large, wide form of King, even before he stepped into the light.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Adam demanded.</p><p>\u201cThis is King,\u201d John said. \u201cHe\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s... black,\u201d Adam pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d King murmured dryly.</p><p>\u201cHe was\u2014is\u2014\u201d Adam didn\u2019t seem able to continue, which was probably for the best. How did you explain that the man in front of you had once been a slave owner a century and a half after slavery had ended?</p><p>\u201cYou want to tell me of his slave-owning past?\u201d King asked. \u201cThat he was one of the more brutal owners my ancestors ever knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this guy?\u201d Adam murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the great-great-several-times-great-grandson of Mawu.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThe voodoo queen who cursed Grandp\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very same,\u201d King agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s how I got my name. My mother wanted to keep the family connection alive.\u201d</p><p>I remembered Maggie explaining that New Orleans voodoo priests and priestesses were more often referred to as kings and queens. Hell.</p><p>\u201cYou said you were named after Elvis,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cI lied.\u201d</p><p>My gaze went to the sharp silver implement on the floor at my feet. I wondered if it would work on him.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill him when you had the chance?\u201d Adam asked. \u201cNot that I want you to, but\u2014\u201d He spread his hands. \u201cI would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t the same man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t a man,\u201d Adam murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe got that,\u201d I said, sick of hearing it myself.</p><p>John cast me a curious, almost hopeful glance, and I looked away. I couldn\u2019t bear to gaze into those eyes. Just seeing them reminded me of each and every lie. Had anyone told the truth about anything around here? Including me?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to live with the knowledge of all I\u2019d done,\u201d John explained. \u201cI was haunted by the faces, driven mad by the voices. But after the first time I tried to die and failed, I realized I couldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d He shifted his gaze to Adam, who made a derisive sound.</p><p>\u201cNone of the cures worked,\u201d John continued. \u201cNot magic, not potions, not science, not medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still Mawu\u2019s method,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cMawu the voodoo queen who cursed him over a century ago is still walking around?\u201d If so, I didn\u2019t want to meet her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Adam answered. \u201cCassandra raised her from de dead.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows shot up. \u201cWow. She is good.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s lips curved. \u201cMawu said I could only be cured by committing the ultimate sacrifice. However, I can\u2019t give my life, or others suffer.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat if in giving your life, the curse is broken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t know if it worked until too late. And to be honest, chica, my life isn\u2019t that big of a sacrifice.</p><p>I no longer relish it.\u201d</p><p>I felt a twinge in the region of my heart. Hadn\u2019t his life been a little better with me in it?</p><p>Idiot. He was a formerly psychotic werewolf, with the \u201cformerly\u201d still out for votes. He\u2019d probably been using me all along, trying to make me love him just so he could break my heart and laugh maniacally. Isn\u2019t that what sadists did?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to figure something out,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d John indicated King. \u201cHe\u2019s a lougaro.\u201d</p><p>Adam tensed. \u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoodoo werewolf,\u201d I supplied.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d King held up a hand. \u201cI\u2019m a shapeshifting sorcerer. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t wander the night, drinking the blood of children?\u201d I felt rather than saw Adam inch closer.</p><p>\u201cOld wives\u2019 tale.\u201d King made a face. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t believe everything you hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you didn\u2019t hold with voodoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLied,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cThat was your altar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The spell allowed me to shift into other forms and roam the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the black cat.\u201d He nodded. \u201cThe pig?\u201d Another nod. \u201cWere you a wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt times.\u201d</p><p>Adam suddenly had a gun in his hand and I hadn\u2019t even seen him move. I hadn\u2019t detected the telltale bulge of his carrying one either. Impressive.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t evil,\u201d John said. \u201cHe\u2019s magic.\u201d</p><p>Adam didn\u2019t look convinced, and he didn\u2019t lower the gun. \u201cMagic didn\u2019t work before, what makes you think it\u2019ll work now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the form of a beast I commune with the loas,\u201d King explained, \u201cand from them I learned what John must do to be cured. He must kill them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill what?\u201d Adam asked. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe werewolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has to kill every werewolf before he\u2019s healed?\u201d Adam rubbed his forehead. \u201cGrandp\u00e8re, that\u2019ll take another hundred and fifty years.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth, shut it again. There were that many of them?</p><p>\u201cNot all the werewolves, p etit-f ils, merely the ones I made.\u201d</p><p>Adam hesitated. \u201cThat might also take a really long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as long as you think.\u201d John glanced my way. \u201cThere is only one more.\u201d</p><p>\u201d One more? How can you be sure? You\u2019ve been killing and maiming and having a grand old time for a century and a half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hunters have taken care of many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunters?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d they said as one.</p><p>\u201cThe ones left I called to this place, and they came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalled?\u201d Adam appeared confused.</p><p>\u201cI am the alpha; their leader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe master,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>John\u2019s eyes met mine. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The crazy guy who\u2019d come to Rising Moon had been one of his proteges.</p><p>\u201cWhat does p as argent mean?\u201d I asked, remembering what he\u2019d muttered after the knife had gone into the man\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cNot silver,\u201d he said.</p><p>I should have taken French in high school. Two years of German wasn\u2019t doing me a damn bit of good.</p><p>John hadn\u2019t been able to kill the man without silver, or without becoming a wolf himself\u2014and how could he with me standing right there\u2014but I had no doubt he\u2019d been the one to take care of the problem later, then dump it in the swamp.</p><p>\u201cYour evil spawn was spread across de country,\u201d Adam said. \u201cHow could you call them here from all over? How do you even know who they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember every single one,\u201d John murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s my cross to bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd nothing less than you deserve,\u201d Adam said. \u201cBut how did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had help.\u201d</p><p>Before he could elaborate a cell phone rang. Adam reached into a voluminous pocket of his khaki pants.</p><p>\u201d Oui?\u201d he answered, then listened, his frown deepening. \u201cYes, it\u2019s Grandp\u00e8re. I will.\u201d</p><p>He flipped the phone closed and glanced at John. \u201cOur presence is requested at de mansion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t wish to go to the mansion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m supposed to drug you and drag you anyway.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cEdward\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Adam dipped his head.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Edward?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cMy boss,\u201d Adam said, at the same time John murmured, \u201cMy fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s informative.\u201d</p><p>Adam shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet him soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d John stepped between us. \u201cShe isn\u2019t going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward says she is. Cassandra told him that Anne knows just about everything. Besides, they\u2019re going to cure Sullivan, and if they do, he\u2019s going to be confused. He\u2019ll need someone there he trusts.\u201d</p><p>Over my better judgment, I was intrigued. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d King said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d John ordered. \u201cEdward can smell a shapeshifter a mile away, and when he does, he kills them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a guinea pig. When I cease to be useful, my days of breathing will end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d King snapped. \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood choice.\u201d Adam led the way out the door.</p><p>As I passed beneath the horseshoe I wondered aloud, \u201cWhy were you able to walk under iron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t work.\u201d John glanced back. \u201cMost of the old myths don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why calling your human name when you were in wolf form was a bust too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Rodolfo isn\u2019t my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it would have worked anyway.\u201d</p><p>We reached the ground floor and slipped onto Frenchmen as dawn turned the sky a pale peach.</p><p>\u201cDoes anything work?\u201d I asked.</p><p>An ancient, rusted Chevy was parked at the curb.</p><p>The thing must have been thirty years old; the paint had been sanded off, leaving a body with no true color to speak of.</p><p>Adam went around the front and opened the driver\u2019s side door. \u201cI stick with silver.\u201d His eyes met John\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWorks every time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-two</p><p>John opened the passenger door, but before I could climb in Adam spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t want him sitting behind me.\u201d</p><p>John did as Adam indicated without comment, opening the back door for me, then climbing in next to his several times great-grandson. I still couldn\u2019t get my mind around that.</p><p>Adam used one hand to drive, leaving the other free to hold a gun on John. I didn\u2019t have to ask if the thing was loaded with silver bullets. Adam didn\u2019t mess around.</p> <p>Casting a sidelong glance at John, Adam made a U-turn and headed for the road that would take us over Lake Pontchartrain toward the swamp.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your accent?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t keep talking like you and expect people not to connect the dots. Especially with Sullivan snooping around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough. Still, it can\u2019t be easy to put aside over a century of habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had plenty of time behind silver bars to practice.\u201d</p> <p>There were a lot of dots I was connecting myself as I listened to them talk. John had been incarcerated somewhere in Montana. There were hunters out there, of which Adam seemed to be one. And someone named Edward, whom I would meet very soon, was in charge of it all.</p><p>\u201cYou had a Cajun accent?\u201d I guessed.</p><p>\u201d Oui,\u201d John said.</p><p>I recalled the few instances he\u2019d slipped into French, an occasion or two when he\u2019d called me cher. The one time he\u2019d used \u201cde\u201d for \u201cthe\u201d I\u2019d merely thought him overtired.</p><p>For the most part he\u2019d been very convincing, speaking with no discernible accent and interspersing his dialogue with Spanish now and again. Calling me chica had helped. He wouldn\u2019t have to bother anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou said your whole family was dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI said a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her how they died?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill them, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot directly, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen in our family often choose to eat a shotgun barrel rather than become like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cToo many,\u201d John said in a voice that was both haunted and detached.</p><p>\u201cSullivan checked out John Rodolfo,\u201d I continued. \u201c\u2018He exists.\u201d</p> <p>Adam glanced over, then back at the road. \u201cHow\u2019d you swing that? Eat de guy, then assume his identity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d Adam pressed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t exactly a computer-hacking genius.\u201d</p><p>I bet not. The thought of all that had happened in the world since John had been alive made my head spin. I started to wonder how much of a gift immortality might be.</p><p>\u201cI had help with that too,\u201d John explained.</p><p>\u201cEdward\u2019s lost his fucking mind,\u201d Adam muttered.</p><p>We were silent for the rest of the drive to the Honey Island Swamp\u2014at least half an hour, maybe more, I lost track. Out here, away from the Quarter, the damage from Katrina was still visible. Sure, they were working on putting some places back together again, but others appeared as if they\u2019d never been touched</p><p>\u2014except by a hurricane.</p><p>Miles upon miles of abandoned apartments and houses, collapsed walls, broken windows. Hundreds of cars beneath the overpasses, filled with silt, white with dust and corrosion. Empty strip malls, Wal-Marts, McDonald\u2019s. Ghostly parking lots, deserted streets without a single moving vehicle. As we rolled past, all I could do was stare and try not to cry. I\u2019d seen it on the news, but nothing could have prepared me for this.</p><p>At last, Adam turned off the main road and we sped down a two-lane highway, before turning into a long dirt path shrouded by huge cypress trees, which should have been dripping Spanish moss but weren\u2019t.</p><p>Instead, new growths had sprouted where the old had been torn away, spiky tendrils that resembled melted steel wool.</p><p>The sun burst over the horizon, causing the dew to sparkle like fireflies on every blade of grass.</p><p>I\u2019d read the swamp had been devastated by Katrina, with hundred-year-old trees being ripped from the ground and tossed about like matchsticks, houseboats driven into the mud up to their decks; a lot of the wildlife had died. For quite a while the only living things in abundance were the vultures. But I could see the swamp was coming back much more quickly than the strip malls ever would.</p><p>Around a tight bend a house appeared. More than a house, really, a mansion, as they\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cHow on earth is that still standing?\u201d The structure appeared to have been built before the Civil War.</p><p>\u201cCypress wood.\u201d Adam stopped next to several other cars. \u201cDoesn\u2019t rot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the hurricane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were very lucky,\u201d was all he said.</p><p>I saw evidence of recent improvements, or perhaps repairs. The porch was new, the windows and roof as well. A coat of paint was in order, but first things first, I suppose.</p><p>A light mist shrouded everything, making the place appear spooky, even in the sunlight. There might have been a yard once, maybe even some crops somewhere, but the swamp had spread nearly to the front door, the only solid area a small circle around the house and the slightly higher hard-packed dirt driveway.</p><p>The gentle, peaceful lapping of water filled the air, broken occasionally by a splash as fish jumped.</p><p>Larger, heavier splashes made me wonder how close to a house an alligator might roam.</p><p>\u201cThe gris-gris,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Adam turned with a lift of his brow. \u201cWhat gris-gris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was one under my pillow\u2014actually two. Someone familiar with voodoo said it was meant to repel werewolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would have done that?\u201d Adam kept the gun trained on John.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d John continued to stare at the house.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cFrom the minute I heard your voice, I was\u2014\u201d He broke off. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>King had said my voice called to him. I\u2019d relished the idea that he couldn\u2019t see my plain face, my average body, that all he knew was the essence of me. But John had been able to see me all along. I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of that.</p><p>\u201cYou tried to keep yourself away from me,\u201d I guessed. \u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d John said tightly. \u201cI\u2019m a werewolf, Anne. I don\u2019t know if that will ever change. And even if it does...\u201d He rubbed his forehead with one beautiful hand. \u201cI\u2019ll always be haunted by what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ll never deserve a life after all the lives I\u2019ve taken. I can\u2019t give you anything you should have. I can\u2019t be a husband, or a father. I wasn\u2019t much of a human being even before I became an animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you hire her if she was so irresistible?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKing did,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cHe said I\u2019d be useful. I thought because of Mardi Gras.\u201d</p><p>John glanced away. \u201cHe had the crazy idea that if I fell for you it might help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to go inside,\u201d Adam murmured.</p><p>I followed his gaze. A tall, voluptuous redhead wearing j eans and a tank top stood on the porch. She was flanked by an ancient, skeletal old man dressed from head to toe in camouflage. He had a bandolier of bullets across his scrawny chest, a pistol at his hip and a shotgun in one gnarled hand.</p><p>On the other side a gorgeous willowy blonde in black j eans and a red tank top stared intently at John. I didn\u2019t like that look at all.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cMy wife, Diana,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cThe redhead or the ice queen?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cRedhead. The other one is Dr. Elise Hanover. She\u2019s here to cure Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>Blond, gorgeous, and a doctor. Didn\u2019t that just figure?</p><p>John opened the door and got out. So did Adam and I.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s de boy?\u201d Adam called.</p><p>\u201cI sent him with Devon,\u201d Diana answered. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to see\u2014\u201d Her gaze flicked to John; wariness filtered over her face.</p><p>John dipped his head politely. Diana merely narrowed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHenri.\u201d Elise came down two of the steps, then paused as if she didn\u2019t want to get too close. \u201cHave you found what you were searching for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. And I\u2019m John now. Thanks to Edward.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the old man, who kept his shotgun pointed at the ground, but angled in John\u2019s direction.</p><p>Edward stared at me. \u201cAnne Lockheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward Mandenauer.\u201d He bowed and clicked his heels, his heavy German accent complementing his Old World mannerisms.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Cassandra, you are aware of the world that exists parallel to your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe werewolves? Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are searching for someone you have lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister.\u201d What did one have to do with the other?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get on with this,\u201d John interrupted. \u201cPoor Sullivan doesn\u2019t need to be psychotic any longer than he has to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Sullivan?\u201d I echoed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like him much before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him now, but I don\u2019t want anyone to be tormented when they can be cured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept it isn\u2019t a torment,\u201d Elise murmured, \u201cand you know that as well as I do.\u201d</p><p>The two of them stared at each other and something passed between them, something I liked even less than the smell of rotting vegetation in the swamp.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you give him a new identity?\u201d Adam demanded. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you\u2019d let him loose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could stick your nose in things and mess them up?\u201d Elise turned her attention from John to Adam. \u201cThe only way to cure him is to find a way out of his curse. He couldn\u2019t do that in Montana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a sadistic werewolf for over a century, then he went crazy\u2014or crazier. You just let him come back to de scene of most of his crimes and start killing people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t killing p eop le,\u201d John said tightly.</p><p>\u201cSo you say. But you\u2019ve lied before.\u201d</p><p>Adam had a point.</p><p>\u201cThe J\u00e4ger-Sucher society is supposed to be some all-powerful Special Forces agency with tentacles everywhere,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Diana glanced at me and shrugged as if to say, he\u2019s on a roll, there\u2019s no stopping him now.</p><p>I could translate J\u00e4ger-Sucher to \u201cHunter-searcher\u201d as well as the next mid-level German student, but the word didn\u2019t tell me any more than I already knew. However, Adam didn\u2019t give me a chance to ask any questions.</p><p>\u201cYet Grandp\u00e8re can just walk out of an impenetrable compound and trot into New Orleans, then set up shop with none of us de wiser?\u201d</p><p>\u201d \u2018Impenetrable\u2019 means no one can get in.\u201d Edward leaned his shotgun against the porch rail.</p><p>\u201cLately,\u201d Elise muttered.</p><p>Edward ignored her. \u201cIt does not mean someone cannot leave if they are allowed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took him there to fix him,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d Elise spread her hands. One palm sported a tattoo in the shape of a pentagram. She didn\u2019t seem the tattoo type.</p><p>\u201cHe might have been doing anything down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I would let one such as he wander about?\u201d Edward shook his head and made a tsking noise.</p><p>\u201cI am not stupid. There was an agent close to him at all times. One with orders to contact me should anything go awry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cKing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I found him,\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d Edward spread his hands. \u201cHowever, I found him first. It occurred to me that you might try and contact the last remaining ancestor of the woman who cursed you. King has been on my payroll for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon enough,\u201d Elise murmured, \u201cthat Edward has his bony fingers in everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen King hasn\u2019t truly forgiven me.\u201d John sounded lost. \u201cHe was just following orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis orders were to blow out your brains with silver if you did anything you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling Grandp\u00e8re makes me a loup-garou,\u201d Adam said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to avoid that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy duty is to protect humankind from the beasts. If that involves killing one, but making another to be killed at a later date...\u201d Edward lifted one shoulder. \u201cSo be it.\u201d</p><p>Adam scowled, and turned toward John. \u201cYou actually thought de man whose grandmother you owned could be your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to back off.\u201d I stepped forward. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to make things right, and you aren\u2019t helping.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou have no idea what he\u2019s done, chica.\u201d The emphasis on the last word was insulting.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d John said in a voice that was infinitely weary. \u201cLet\u2019s get on with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Edward agreed. \u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-three</p><p>When Adam had said he was keeping Sullivan in his dungeon, he\u2019d been exaggerating. Slightly.</p><p>The six of us tramped into the swamp. I wasn\u2019t wild about the idea, but then again I wasn\u2019t going to let John out of my sight. The way Adam kept glaring at him and Diana kept flinching whenever he came near, combined with Edward\u2019s habit of pointing a gun in his direction, made me worry he wouldn\u2019t come out of the swamp at all.</p><p>Why did I care? I wasn\u2019t quite sure.</p> <p>What I was certain of was that I wanted to see Sullivan cured and not just because I missed the man who\u2019d been my friend; I wanted to see magic done. Who wouldn\u2019t?</p><p>A cool breeze brushed the long grass, causing the tiny tendrils of moss hanging from the cypress trees to sway. The damage was more visible deeper within the swamp. One tree had been yanked from the earth by the wind, then driven back into the muck branches first, the roots reaching like emaciated arms toward the sky.</p><p>A heavy splash to the right made me skitter in the other direction, and my tennis shoe sank ankle deep in ooze. I tugged, but my leg was stuck.</p><p>\u201cWas that an alligator?\u201d Panic made my voice wobble.</p><p>\u201cMost likely.\u201d Diana paused to help me out.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I thought a lot of the wildlife died in Katrina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome did. But there were plenty of alligators to go around.\u201d She gave my leg a good yank and my foot came free with a wet, gloppy squelch. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; they won\u2019t come near us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a gris-gris?\u201d I shook my foot, and globs of mud flew.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She glanced at John. \u201cThey don\u2019t like wolves.\u201d</p><p>She turned on her heel and hurried to catch up to her husband.</p><p>After half an hour of hoofing it through the swamp, we topped a slight rise and stared down at a dilapidated cabin that seemed to have sprung from the earth.</p> <p>\u201cSullivan\u2019s here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019d keep him near my family, do you?\u201d Adam headed down the hill.</p><p>Man, the guy was cranky. I guess I wouldn\u2019t be too cheery either with the prospect of the crescent moon curse hanging over my head, and that of my young son; but he was starting to get on my nerves.</p><p>We filed into the cabin. The main room was dominated by a cage, and in that cage resided Conner Sullivan.</p><p>\u201cWhere are his clothes?\u201d I whispered, staring in spite of myself at the thick muscled legs, the bulging arms, and flat, rippling belly.</p><p>\u201cHe shifted, which makes clothes garbage,\u201d Diana explained. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any point in getting new ones until he was cured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of inhumane, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t human,\u201d Diana answered.</p> <p>Sullivan had been eyeing all of us with a sardonic smile. When his gaze reached me he licked his lips and his eyes flared. \u201cGlad you\u2019re here, Anne. That\u2019ll save me time once I\u2019ve killed them all.\u201d</p><p>Why had I come again? Oh, yeah, to get my friend back. But I was starting to wonder if I\u2019d ever be able to look at him and not remember what he\u2019d done. I couldn\u2019t stop remembering it now.</p><p>My thoughts must have shown on my face, because Sullivan laughed, the sound causing the hair on my arms to dance.</p><p>\u201cI knew you couldn\u2019t stay away,\u201d he murmured. \u201cRodolfo\u2019s cock isn\u2019t big enough for you.\u201d Reaching down, he began to stroke himself. \u201cMine will be. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to fix him, do it,\u201d John snapped.</p><p>\u201cHit a nerve?\u201d Sullivan stopped masturbating\u2014thank God. \u201cAlthough now that I see you, really see you and him\u201d\u2014he j erked his head in Adam\u2019s direction\u2014\u201dI don\u2019t think your name is Rodolfo. It\u2019s Ruelle, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>His lips pulled back in a sneer. \u201cI always knew you were killing people. How many was it? Twenty?</p><p>Thirty? Do you like to fuck them as they die? Doesn\u2019t the blood taste better when they\u2019re scared? You must know all sorts of ways to make the experience better. Can we talk?\u201d</p><p>The contrast between the previously proper and polite Sullivan and the disgusting animal before us now was astounding. If this was the way John had been when he was Henri, I could understand why no one in the room could stand to be near him. Even I inched farther away.</p><p>Sullivan grinned. \u201cShe knows you for what you are now. You\u2019ll never get into her pants again. I\u2019m surprised you managed it in the first place. But then, she doesn\u2019t know what you did, does she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d John said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? I bet your victims could pick you out of any lineup. But then, once they\u2019re victims, they\u2019d never betray you. They\u2019re part of your pack. Under your control.\u201d His eyes, darker than John\u2019s with much scarier shadows beneath the surface, shifted to mine. \u201cYou know, I remembered where I saw the eyes of the wolf that bit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d John whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt took me a while to place them because I\u2019d never seen them up close.\u201d</p><p>Elise had moved nearer to the cage while Sullivan rambled on. He didn\u2019t appear to be paying any attention to her, but with a movement so fast it blurred before my eyes Sullivan yanked her against the bars.</p><p>He roared and slapped his hands to his face. Elise doubled over and did the same.</p><p>I started forward, but John pulled me back. \u201cDon\u2019t go near him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s hurt. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise is a werewolf too.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say to that except, \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we touch skin to skin, we know,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Elise straightened, dropping her arms to her sides. \u201cExtreme ice cream headache on contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how can she... ?\u201d I trailed off, uncertain how, or even what, to ask.</p><p>\u201cElise is different.\u201d John let go of my arm, his gaze on Elise. \u201cShe was born a werewolf, although she was never evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorn?\u201d I echoed, as horror rolled through me. \u201cIs that possible?\u201d</p><p>He caught my expression, immediately understood my concern. \u201cNot the way you think. We can\u2019t\u2014\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cImpregnate.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but wince at the word, and a flicker of sadness shone in John\u2019s eyes before he continued.</p><p>\u201cElise is a special case. Her mother was Edward\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s his grandchild?\u201d I whispered, glancing back and forth between them.</p><p>\u201cThe werewolves turned his only child into a monster in vengeance for his killing so many of their kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did what had to be done,\u201d Edward murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou killed your own child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t my child anymore.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but stare at the man. How could he have done such a thing? Then again\u2014</p><p>My gaze went to Sullivan. Maybe it was understandable.</p><p>Sullivan dropped his hands and snarled at Elise. \u201cThat hurt, bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSticks and stones,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He bellowed with fury and she reached out, smacking her tattooed palm against his forehead. Sullivan stilled, his face gone slack, his eyes unfocused.</p><p>Elise closed her eyes; an expression of complete peace flickered over her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cCuring him.\u201d</p><p>John stared at Elise with such longing, a shaft of unwelcome j ealousy burned in me. Something was between them, but what?</p><p>\u201cShe was given the gift to make us whole again in the Land of Souls,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cVoodoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Oj ibwe heaven.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows lifted. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look Oj ibwe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>A tiny smile curved his lips, though it didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Elise said, and dropped her hand.</p><p>Sullivan\u2019s eyes opened. He blinked, staring at Elise in confusion. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Hanover. You\u2019ve been unwell, Detective. But you\u2019ll be all right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sick? I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things are better forgotten.\u201d She glanced at Edward, then took Sullivan\u2019s hand. I braced for the outcry, but this time nothing happened.</p><p>Smiling, she released him. \u201cHe\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m naked,\u201d Sullivan said in shock.</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d Elise handed him what appeared to be sweatpants and a T-shirt, socks and underwear, some shoes.</p><p>Sullivan frowned when he saw the rest of us. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d He used the pile of clothes to cover his nether region. \u201cWhat kind of hospital is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivate,\u201d Elise said, unperturbed. \u201cYou needed special care. What you had was... contagious.\u201d</p><p>A mild way of putting it.</p><p>Sullivan got dressed in a hurry. Elise glanced at the rest of us. \u201cIf you could step outside for a bit? I have a few tests to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne?\u201d Sullivan called. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Elise, uncertain, and she took over. \u201cI asked Anne to come and take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Great. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He seemed lost, almost childlike. I should feel sorry for him, maybe even protective of him. But I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Every time he spoke, I heard him saying other, more hateful things. When he stared at me I had to fight not to run away.</p><p>John and I followed Adam and Diana outside. Edward remained with Elise.</p><p>The Ruelles moved off, heads together as they whispered. John stared after them. He knew they were talking about him as well as I did.</p><p>\u201cSullivan doesn\u2019t remember anything about being a werewolf?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d John said. \u201cWhen she touches them, everything that happened from right before they\u2019re bitten until the moment they\u2019re cured is gone. Otherwise we\u2019d have a lot of screaming, crying, insane people instead of just confused ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remembered,\u201d I murmured, \u201cand it drove you mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they going to tell Sullivan about the time he lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be able to convince him he was sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are they going to explain away a mortal throat wound that disappeared without a trace to all the people, besides me, who saw it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but they always do. Most choose to believe a logical explanation, however illogical it might be, rather than believe the unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>Strangely enough, that made sense. I know I wanted to forget about Sullivan\u2019s gaping throat and pretty much everything that had happened after it.</p><p>\u201cThe tough ones are those who\u2019ve been around for several hundred years. How do you tell someone it\u2019s the twenty-first century when their last memory is from seventeen fifty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Edward\u2019s j ob\u2014or at least that of the J\u00e4ger-Suchers.\u201d</p><p>Here was my opening. \u201cWhat\u2019s a J\u00e4ger-Sucher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter-searcher.\u201d</p><p>That much I knew, and perhaps a little bit more.</p><p>\u201cThey hunt monsters, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Edward is their leader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe formed the group after World War Two. He was a spy, his mission to discover what Mengele was up to in his secret lab in the Black Forest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t Mengele the one who performed all those sick experiments on the Jews?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd anyone else Hitler didn\u2019t care for. The Fuehrer ordered a werewolf army. Mengele made him</p><p>one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I broke off. \u201cHistory might not have been my best subj ect, still... I\u2019d have remembered a werewolf army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Allies landed; Mengele panicked and released what he\u2019d made into the world. Edward got there too late to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he formed the J\u00e4ger-Suchers to remedy that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>The thought was disturbing on many levels. That such a group existed, and no one knew about them, that there were monsters everywhere, and no one knew about them either. Most of all\u2014</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s been hunting for over fifty years, why aren\u2019t they all dead yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonsters multiply, and from what I\u2019ve gathered, the werewolves have been using magic, mysticism, drugs, to create new and better monsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t one of Mengele\u2019s werewolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were werewolves before he invented them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. There are legends of humans becoming wolves as far back as the Bible and then some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that explains why the J\u00e4ger-Suchers are still in business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings that have been around since the beginning of time are hard to exterminate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenri,\u201d Diana called.</p><p>John\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cMy name is John.\u201d</p><p>Diana stopped several feet away and eyed him warily. \u201cAdam and I think you should stay with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said shortly, biting off the word with that snooty twist only the French seem capable of.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a place of my own. I have it for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat reason?\u201d Her face creased. \u201cTo play j azz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile that\u2019s always enj oyable, and soothing to the savage beast\u201d\u2014his voice took on a sarcastic twist\u2014</p><p>\u201cthat\u2019s not why I do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making any sense, Grandp\u00e8re.\u201d Adam came up behind his wife and laid his hands on her shoulders. I was distracted momentarily by his long and elegant fingers, which looked exactly like John\u2019s.</p><p>They were so alike it was downright creepy.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s calling in his wolves.\u201d Edward stood in the doorway. \u201cThe music is an extension of him\u2014the human equivalent of a howl\u2014although I\u2019m sure he howls on the nights of the crescent moon as well.\u201d</p><p>John spread his hands in a gesture that said, Of course.</p><p>\u201cA j azz club is busy,\u201d Edward continued. \u201cNo one will notice people coming and going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept Sullivan,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Edward\u2019s sharp blue eyes flicked to mine, and he dipped his head in acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cWhen he plays the saxophone, the wolves come to him,\u201d Diana murmured, \u201cbut how did you get them to New Orleans in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was my doing,\u201d Edward said. \u201cWe recorded his howl, then I used new satellite technology to embed the sound in various satellite products.\u201d</p><p>For a minute we were all silent, no doubt thinking of all the things satellites were used for in this day and age.</p><p>\u201cEach wolf\u2019s howl is distinct,\u201d Edward explained, \u201cand they howl for many reasons. For instance, to assemble a pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wolves knew the sound, and they were compelled to come to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how would they know where to come?\u201d I pressed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard legends of dogs traveling hundreds of miles to return home? Wolves are no different. My home is New Orleans, which makes it theirs too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t they notice they were being picked off one by one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fought most of them in wolf form, then dumped the bodies in the swamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSullivan is ready to leave.\u201d Edward was staring at me.</p><p>Suddenly I was hyperventilating. I\u2019d thought I could face Sullivan once he was \u201chimself\u201d again, but I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see him,\u201d I blurted.</p><p>Sympathy crossed the old man\u2019s face. \u201cThen you don\u2019t have to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-four</p><p>I was grateful to be spared an encounter with Sullivan before I was ready. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever be.</p><p>What I\u2019d love to do was hightail it out of New Orleans and never come back, but I still hadn\u2019t found .</p><p>Katie. I was starting to think I wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>Adam drove us into town. Diana remained behind to deal with Sullivan. \u201cI\u2019ll take him home, get him settled, talk to his boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will take care of the rest,\u201d Edward murmured.</p><p>I took \u201cthe rest\u201d to mean the hospital, the doctors, the EMTs, the police who\u2019d handled his case. Edward would be busy for a while.</p><p>Late afternoon sunshine slanted over the roof of Rising Moon as Adam pulled to a stop at the curb.</p><p>Through the big front windows, King was visible behind the bar.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave town, Grandp\u00e8re. I wouldn\u2019t like having to come after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hardly going to leave town before he finds that last werewolf and ends the curse,\u201d I said sharply.</p><p>\u201cWhat she said.\u201d John climbed out of the car and headed inside.</p><p>Adam watched him go with a concerned expression. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>I got out of the car too. \u201cHe isn\u2019t Henri Ruelle. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope to God you\u2019re right.\u201d Adam drove away.</p> <p>As I stepped into the club, King came out from behind the bar and trailed in John\u2019s wake. I shut the door, flipped the sign to closed, and engaged the lock just as King snagged John\u2019s arm.</p><p>Expecting an outcry as pain erupted in both of their heads, I was surprised when John merely stopped and stared pointedly at King\u2019s hand.</p><p>King withdrew it with a wary gaze. He seemed almost scared, and while that was ludicrous considering King had a good six inches and probably a hundred pounds on Rodolfo, with the strength of a werewolf, John could no doubt toss King across the room without even trying.</p><p>\u201cHow can he touch you?\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t the boss of me,\u201d King snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d I gestured vaguely. \u201cThe headache. When werewolves touch skin to skin.\u201d</p><p>Understanding spread across King\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a werewolf.\u201d John\u2019s voice was weary. \u201cHe\u2019s a lougaro. Sometimes a wolf, sometimes a cat, a pig\u2014anything he desires he can become by performing the spell. He\u2019s not infected by a virus that alters his genetic makeup.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were cursed,\u201d I said. \u201cNot bitten. Your DNA should be the same as mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe curse made me a lycanthrope in every way. I\u2019m merely compelled to shift on the nights of the crescent moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be certain your DNA is different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I bite people, they become like me.\u201d</p><p>A horrible thought came to mind. If lycanthropy was a virus passed through bodily fluids... Well, I\u2019d been exchanging a lot of fluids with John Rodolfo.</p><p>My fears must have shown on my face. I\u2019d never been very good at hiding things. \u201cOnly through the bite in wolf form, chica. There\u2019s no other way.\u201d He stared at me for a long minute, then whispered, \u201cYou can\u2019t think I\u2019d make you like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course not.\u201d</p><p>But what if he didn\u2019t want to be alone? What if he wanted someone to share eternity with? What would I say if he asked me?</p><p>I\u2019d say no. Because if John bit me I wouldn\u2019t be like him, I\u2019d be like Henri. And while I hadn\u2019t met the man, not really, I\u2019d heard enough to know I\u2019d rather be dead than a werewolf like that.</p><p>\u201cWhere are your sunglasses, Johnny?\u201d King asked.</p><p>John patted his shirt pocket and withdrew them.</p><p>\u201cYou need to keep wearing those,\u201d King said. \u201cFolks might get a little freaked out by your sudden ability to see.\u201d</p><p>John slipped the glasses over his eyes and turned away.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d King said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of Edward\u2019s men. You\u2019ve orders to kill me if I start eating the customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohnny,\u201d King said softly, and John sighed, then faced him. \u201cI want to help you. That hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you help me?\u201d</p><p>Confusion flickered over King\u2019s face. \u201cBecause I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owned your grandmother. Hell, I did a lot more than own her. Just because it sickens me now doesn\u2019t take away the truth of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t you.\u201d King put a hand on John\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI believe that, and you should too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t me, then why do I remember it as if it were yesterday? I don\u2019t even have to be asleep to see her face. To see all their faces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d I began, and he cut me off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Anne. Of all the people in this world, you shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d His voice broke.</p><p>I glanced at King, worried, but he had no time for me. \u201cVoodoo is about balance. Good and evil. Happy and sad. Life and death. You asked why I helped you? That\u2019s why. You\u2019ve done a lot of evil; time to do some good. The only way you can, is if you\u2019re cured. I\u2019ve seen your pain. You\u2019ve paid your debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never can. The debt\u2019s too great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were possessed by evil,\u201d King said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI was evil before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only way to atone is to help others. Love someone. Create life instead of spreading death.\u201d</p><p>My heart began to pound faster. If John were cured, he\u2019d be a normal man. What would that mean to me?</p><p>I was afraid to hope. Because there was a big \u201cif\u201d on the other end of that wish.</p><p>King grabbed John\u2019s hand, turned it over and pressed his thumb to the white scar that marred John\u2019s wrist. \u201cYour death won\u2019t change a goddamned thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are people who\u2019d be glad of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hell with them. They need to forgive.\u201d</p><p>John lifted his head. \u201cDid you forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t own me, Johnny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But what good is forgiving someone for a minor offense? I\u2019ll pave my way to heaven by forgiving the incredibly huge fuckups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d John muttered.</p><p>Silence descended, lingering heavily until King spoke again. \u201cIf I can forgive you, then so can she.\u201d</p><p>John stilled. I did too.</p><p>\u201cShe who?\u201d I asked.</p><p>The men ignored me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d John said. \u201cShe won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her,\u201d King insisted.</p><p>\u201cTell her what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>The three of us were so intent on our conversation, we didn\u2019t notice someone had come in the back door until a shadow fell over the floor. I glanced up.</p><p>A woman stood framed in the doorway, the setting sun flaring red all around her. I couldn\u2019t see her face.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re supposed to tell Anne about me,\u201d she said.</p><p>A wave of dizziness made me sway. I knew that voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-five</p><p>\u201cKatie?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>John grabbed me around the waist before I could rush forward.

That laugh didn\u2019t sound like Katie at all.</p> <p>\u201cIs that her?\u201d My voice shook.</p><p>She stepped closer, out of the fading sunshine and into the light. Someone else stared out of my little sister\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I whispered, because I knew, even before the woman who was my sister, and yet not my sister, spoke.</p><p>\u201cHey, John. Long time no bite me.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth were whiter, sharper and seemingly more numerous than I remembered. She was dressed differently than the Katie I\u2019d known would have been\u2014black leather miniskirt and a lacy black blouse, which was unbuttoned far too low, plus four-inch sling-back heels. Her hair was longer, wilder, and her eyes appeared bluer with the insanity burning from within.</p> <p>\u201cPut me down.\u201d My voice was calm and very, very cold.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go near her,\u201d John murmured before he set me on my feet.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to. This Katie frightened me.</p><p>\u201cHe brought me here to kill me,\u201d she said, though she seemed more amused than afraid.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you fucked him.\u201d</p> <p>I winced. Katie laughed that horrible un-Katie-like laugh.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, sis. You didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne,\u201d John began.</p><p>\u201cLet her finish.\u201d</p><p>Katie\u2019s smile became more of a smirk. \u201cI waited for you at the Caradaro Club, remember?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, unable to speak past my guilt. I\u2019d said I would meet her, then I hadn\u2019t. I\u2019d been annoyed over a bracelet, like a three-year-old child. Well, I had the bracelet back, but where was my sister? Staring into Katie\u2019s eyes, I couldn\u2019t find her anywhere.</p><p>\u201cLook at him.\u201d She flicked her fingers in John\u2019s direction. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to go home with a guy like that? He was even hotter then. No goatee. Long hair.\u201d She made a sound of pure lust.</p><p>I found my voice. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSleep with him? Never got a chance when I was human. And once we\u2019re werewolves\u201d\u2014she lifted her hands, then lowered them\u2014\u201dwe\u2019ve got touching issues.\u201d</p><p>The movement fixed my attention on her wrist, which was horribly scarred. \u201cThe bracelet,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>She glanced at the ridged tissue. \u201cI should have let you wear it. When I changed the first time, it nearly fried me alive.\u201d</p><p>Well, the thing was pure silver.</p><p>\u201cGraveyard dirt,\u201d I blurted. \u201cThe bracelet was covered in graveyard dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLover boy buried me in an old cemetery. He knew I\u2019d come back to life and heal all wounds.\u201d She held up her wrist. \u201cExcept this one.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at John, who\u2019d removed his glasses. In his eyes I didn\u2019t see the evil she described. He\u2019d been different then, but I was having a hard time remembering that. Right now, I wanted to kill him.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave the bracelet?\u201d I asked Katie.</p><p>\u201cTo mess with you. This is a game, sis, and you were the bait. He brought you here to get to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut John told me to leave. King\u2014\u201d I glanced around. King had disappeared. My eyes met John\u2019s, and in them, I saw the truth. \u201cThe photograph was King\u2019s idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cSullivan told me it was doctored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Sullivan.\u201d Katie licked her lips and closed her eyes in mock ecstasy. \u201cHe was a very good year.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan had said he knew the eyes of the wolf that had bitten him. He hadn\u2019t recognized them right away because he\u2019d only seen them before in a snapshot.</p><p>\u201cJohn was having a helluva time finding me,\u201d Katie continued. \u201cI always was the best at hide-and- seek.\u201d</p><p>She had been. Whenever we\u2019d played as kids Katie always won.</p><p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand\u201d\u2014Katie frowned\u2014\u201dis how he compelled me to come here in the first place.\u201d</p><p>That I knew, but I didn\u2019t think it was relevant at this time.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I minded since I love Mardi Gras season. It\u2019s like a buffet.\u201d Katie winked. \u201cBut once I got here, and I saw you, I figured out my maker was up to no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you leave?\u201d</p><p>She glared at John. \u201cWhat good is being a werewolf, with the power over life and death, if I have to come whenever he calls me? I wasn\u2019t leaving until one of us was dead. Preferably him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the fail-safe in the virus?\u201d I asked. \u201cWerewolves can\u2019t kill werewolves\u2014unless they\u2019re different, like John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been busy.\u201d Katie contemplated me with a lifted brow. \u201cBut you always were nosy as hell. I can\u2019t kill him, you\u2019re right. But I can get someone else to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA familiar,\u201d John murmured.</p><p>\u201cLike a witch\u2019s familiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way,\u201d Katie said. \u201cExcept a werewolf familiar is a witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a witch helping you,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cI sent Lydia after him, but he\u2019s strong and clever; she couldn\u2019t kill him. Although she did manage to beat the crap out of him once.\u201d</p><p>The night John said he\u2019d been mugged I hadn\u2019t understood how anyone could do such a thing. Of course I hadn\u2019t considered the culprit might be a werewolf familiar. And why would I have?</p><p>\u201cHe killed her.\u201d Katie scowled. \u201cGypsy witches aren\u2019t that easy to come by.\u201d</p><p>King suddenly appeared between Katie and me holding Murphy\u2019s gun. I guess that explained where he\u2019d gone.</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d I laid my hand on his arm. \u201cThe thing\u2019s loaded with silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be any good with lead, girlie.\u201d He shouldered me back, his gaze on Katie.</p><p>Katie growled, her lips pulling away from lengthening canines. John cursed and I glanced at the window.</p><p>The sun was almost down, and the moon would soon be on the rise.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with,\u201d King murmured.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill her,\u201d I blurted. \u201cElise can fix her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be fixed.\u201d Katie\u2019s voice was a low rumbling growl emanating from a still human throat. \u201cI like what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t you,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more me than I ever was before. The inner Katie is free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t a killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am now. I\u2019ve been making my own little pack. Sullivan would have been a wonderful addition. As it is, your little friend Maggie has been fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie?\u201d My voice was faint.</p><p>\u201cShe was so easy. I sent one of my wolves to the cafe, and she came away with him like a lost lamb.\u201d</p><p>The old man. I\u2019d known there was something weird about him.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d like to have a friend who could show you the ropes.\u201d Her lips curved. \u201cWhen I make you like me.\u201d</p><p>The night was warm, but I shivered anyway. \u201cCall Elise,\u201d I said.</p><p>King and John didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cYou guys got a hearing problem? Get Elise over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFixing her won\u2019t fix him, girlie. If John doesn\u2019t kill her, he won\u2019t be cured.\u201d</p><p>My heart sped up until it was pounding thickly at the base of my throat. \u201cHow do you know that for sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe loas told me over and over again the way to break his curse,\u201d King said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never lied to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t it though?\u201d Katie asked in her strange dual voice.</p><p>King held out the gun to John, and he took it. Katie glanced at me as if waiting for a protest, but I hesitated. Katie wasn\u2019t here anymore; in her place was a woman I didn\u2019t recognize. One who enj oyed killing, one who had killed, countless times, one who planned to make me a monster just like her.</p><p>She must have sensed my indecision because she seemed to gather herself, forcing back the call of the rising moon so that when she spoke again, her voice was the one I remembered, although it said things my sister never would have.</p><p>\u201cYou think a guy like Rodolfo would want you? He only fucked you to get to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d King murmured.</p><p>Katie shrugged. \u201cTruth is truth, and she\u2019s not special.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been happy while I\u2019d resided in the fantasyland where John cared about me because he \u201csaw\u201d the extraordinary Anne who lived inside the plain wrapper. His being unable to see had freed me in ways I\u2019d never been free before.</p><p>Except John could see me, had always seen me, just as he\u2019d always known who I was, even though I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>I\u2019d been a means to this end; I\u2019d been bait for the werewolf who was my sister, or who\u2019d at least been my sister before Henri Ruelle came to town.</p><p>While I could understand John\u2019s reasoning, I couldn\u2019t go along with his plan.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d My eyes met his. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. He lowered the gun.</p><p>King cursed. Katie smiled. John went to the phone and dialed.</p><p>\u201cElise? There\u2019s someone at Rising Moon who needs to be cured.\u201d</p><p>Though King was visibly furious over John\u2019s refusal to kill my sister, he put himself between Katie and the back door, leaving John between Katie and the front door.</p><p>I relaxed. By tomorrow I should be able to call my parents and tell them I was bringing Katie home.</p><p>A sudden blur of motion and an outcry from King made me turn. Katie streaked toward the front door.</p><p>John moved in front of her, and she changed direction in the blink of an eye, leaping at the front window, crashing through the glass, hitting the pavement on both feet, and disappearing into the shocked crowd on Frenchmen Street.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean she got away?\u201d</p><p>Adam, Elise, and Edward had arrived less than an hour after Katie had made her escape. Adam was understandably angry. When I\u2019d begged for Katie\u2019s life, I\u2019d conveniently pushed aside all of the other people who would be affected by my need to get my sister back. I guess selfishness wasn\u2019t limited to werewolves.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find a trace of her,\u201d John said.</p><p>He\u2019d gone after Katie immediately, but the moon was gibbous and his curse did not allow him to shapeshift until the shiny silver orb waned to a crescent. With the power of her wolf, Katie had evaded him with ease.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find her,\u201d Edward muttered, and pumped his shotgun.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I cried. \u201cShe can be cured.\u201d I put my hand on Elise\u2019s arm. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever tried to cure a wolf made by one who was cursed.\u201d Elise bit her lip. \u201cThe cure didn\u2019t work with Henri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to try. She didn\u2019t ask to be a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she did,\u201d Adam said. \u201cGrandp\u00e8re always liked to make them choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChoose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife or death. You may be a werewolf or no.\u201d Adam glared at his ancestor.</p><p>John rubbed his forehead and turned away.</p><p>King reached out and smacked Adam in the chest with the flat of his great big hand. Adam fell back.</p><p>\u201cYou will stop tormenting him,\u201d King ground out. \u201cHe has been tormented enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will never be enough.\u201d Adam walked out, and he didn\u2019t return.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d John murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d King said. \u201cHe isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Edward lowered his gun. \u201cI will begin searching for your sister. If I find her, I will call Elise. She may attempt the cure, but if it doesn\u2019t work, I must kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, then hurried on when Edward sighed impatiently. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work, let John kill her.\u201d</p><p>Edward\u2019s faded blond brows shot up, but after peering into my face for several seconds he gave a sharp nod.</p><p>Elise stood behind John. He didn\u2019t look at her, but continued to stare through the unbroken window at the moon. She reached out to touch his shoulder, then snatched her hand back before she did so. \u201cI\u2019ll keep trying to find a cure. There has to be something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d John said, but he didn\u2019t sound any more convinced of it than she did.</p><p>Edward left, and when Elise followed him, I followed her. The old man got into the car. Adam waited behind the wheel. I murmured her name and she paused.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something between you,\u201d I said.</p><p>Elise tilted her head, studying me. \u201cI understand what he\u2019s going through. I\u2019ve been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t evil,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve killed. I have to live with that. So does he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve never been possessed as Henri was, so I can\u2019t say what it\u2019s like. But I\u2019ve studied hundreds of werewolves, and they aren\u2019t the same as they were when they were human.\u201d</p><p>I thought of Sullivan and agreed. Except\u2014</p><p>\u201cHenri was horrible before he was a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I hear. But as he said, he\u2019s John now. He is different. A century and a half can change a man.\u201d Her lips twisted wryly. \u201cAnd you have to remember, he was made a werewolf against his will too. A curse is just as much of a coercion as being bitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve gathered of Henri, he probably would have welcomed what happened to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll never know, because Henri died a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Elise got into the car, and they drove away. When I went inside Rising Moon, King had disappeared, leaving John and me alone.</p><p>The closed sign on the door would remain there until the glass company replaced the hastily constructed barricade over the broken window. All I knew was that I wasn\u2019t going to stay here tonight. Maybe John would let me stay with him.</p><p>I blinked at the thought, one I hadn\u2019t realized I entertained until that moment.</p><p>Though Elise and Edward were struggling to see John as anyone other than Henri, and Adam couldn\u2019t see past his evil Grandp\u00e8re, I\u2019d always seen John as John. Discovering his secret, his past, his former identity, didn\u2019t change that. The man I\u2019d met and fallen in love with was a different person from the one who\u2019d been born, died, and then born again a Ruelle.</p><p>\u201cTake me home with you,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Shock widened John\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow can you even look at me when you know I killed your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. Henri did.\u201d</p><p>John held out his lovely, gifted hands. \u201cThese become paws under the crescent moon, just as they did for Henri.\u201d One shot out and curled around my neck. \u201cHow do you know I won\u2019t rip out your throat?\u201d</p><p>I lifted my own hand, which held the silver letter opener. \u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>He released me with a little shove. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand how it is when the crescent moon rises.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t say his words didn\u2019t disturb me, but I also couldn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t love him.</p><p>\u201cHelp me understand, John.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWas I just bait to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was King\u2019s idea. I didn\u2019t even know what he\u2019d done until you showed up with the picture.\u201d He took a deep breath, then let it out slowly. \u201cTouching you made me feel alive again. So even though it was wrong, I was selfish. I guess I haven\u2019t changed all that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just gave up the only chance you knew of being cured because I asked it of you. That doesn\u2019t sound very selfish to me.\u201d He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cI know the worst, John, and I still love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I feel.\u201d My hand tightened on the letter opener. \u201cYou\u2019re a werewolf, but maybe I could live with that.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s smile was sad. \u201cI won\u2019t sentence you to hundreds of nights alone, wondering where I am, if I\u2019ll come home. I won\u2019t deprive you of the blessing of children just to have you with me.\u201d He cupped my cheek, and I rubbed my face against his hand. \u201cBut most of all I won\u2019t watch you age and die while I remain exactly like this.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t thought of that. Still\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather have nothing than as many years as we could of something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were a coward, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink again,\u201d he said, and walked out the door.</p><p>I was so shocked I didn\u2019t immediately follow. Big mistake.</p><p>Katie had disappeared into the crowd in an instant. John disappeared in a single beat of my heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-six</p><p>I didn\u2019t find him; I didn\u2019t really expect to. John had been outwitting J\u00e4ger-Suchers for over fifty years. A PI from Philly didn\u2019t stand a chance.</p><p>I ended up sleeping one last night in my room above Rising Moon. King returned as I was packing. He stood in the doorway, beneath the worthless horseshoe. \u201cWatch your back, girlie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said. Though I didn\u2019t feel fine. I felt bruised, battered, deep down achingly sad. I was going to miss John for the rest of my life.</p> <p>\u201cYour sister could be anywhere,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe might come after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe ain\u2019t Katie. She will kill you.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out my letter opener, turning it this way and that, until the light caught the silver and sparkled.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, and met King\u2019s eyes. \u201cShe won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>King peered at me for several seconds. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole world\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>King spent the night in Rising Moon with a baseball bat across his lap, protecting the place against looters. I figured I was safer there than anywhere. In the morning, I\u2019d catch a plane to Philly. In the meantime, I needed to figure out what I was going to tell my parents. Certainly not the truth.</p><p>Bright and early, there was a knock on the door of the club. Sullivan stood on the stoop.</p><p>I was tempted to sneak out the back and head straight for the airport. From the expression on King\u2019s face, he expected me to.</p><p>Instead, I opened the door, then moved as far away from the detective as I could get and still be in the same room. His gaze lit on my packed bag, then lifted to my face. \u201cYou\u2019re going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your sister?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t remember what Katie had become, what she\u2019d done to him, and that was good. I wished I</p><p>didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s here.\u201d I figured Katie was as far away from New Orleans by now as she could get.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s changed.\u201d Sullivan fidgeted, uncomfortable. \u201cI did something or said something that\u2019s made you...\u201d His gaze met mine. \u201cHate me.\u201d</p><p>He had, but I couldn\u2019t explain it to him. He deserved the oblivion Elise and the J\u00e4ger-Suchers had provided.</p><p>Sullivan was a good man once more, and he\u2019d go on to do great things.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you,\u201d I lied. \u201cBut I have to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Rodolfo,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as if he\u2019d expected as much, then crossed the room to take my hand. I flinched; I couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t I cut Sullivan the same slack I\u2019d cut John? Why couldn\u2019t I see that the beast who\u2019d hurt me wasn\u2019t the same man as the one in front of me? Perhaps because I\u2019d never seen John as Henri, but I had seen Sullivan as Satan.</p><p>Or perhaps it was because I\u2019d never completely trusted John, sensing something in him he was holding back. But I had trusted Sullivan; I\u2019d felt safe with him. For Sullivan to turn on me, even though it hadn\u2019t been him, had been devastating. I doubted I\u2019d ever get over it.</p><p>Sullivan dropped my hand, but he was still too close for my comfort, and I inched out of his reach.</p><p>\u201cI was sick,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember things. I\u2019m taking a leave of absence from the force until I feel more... myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>I wondered momentarily if he\u2019d give up on his quest for the serial killer, but I kept my lip zipped in case Edward had purged the NOPD of the case. From what I\u2019d seen of Edward, he probably could.</p><p>Our good-bye was awkward. He wanted to hug me; I didn\u2019t want him to, and he knew it. We shook hands, and as soon as he left, I did too.</p><p>Back in Philly, life just wasn\u2019t the same. How could it be? I hadn\u2019t been kidding when I\u2019d told King the whole world had changed.</p><p>Now I knew that evil could lurk behind every smiling face. The night held horrors I easily imagined. I\u2019d seen them, touched them, almost become them.</p><p>In the first hour back in my parents\u2019 company I lied to them so many times I lost count.</p><p>\u201cThe DNA was Katie\u2019s,\u201d they greeted me as soon as I walked in their door.</p><p>I\u2019d completely forgotten we\u2019d sent evidence to the crime lab.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d I said. \u201cThe bracelet was found at the j azz club Rising Moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie had to have been in New Orleans after she disappeared from here,\u201d my father said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She had been, just more recently than we\u2019d thought.</p><p>\u201cSo she must be alive.\u201d</p><p>My parents were conveniently ignoring what blood on a bracelet might mean, and I decided to let them.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I lied.</p><p>Katie wasn\u2019t alive. Not really. She wasn\u2019t even Katie anymore. However, I couldn\u2019t tell my parents that, so I began to avoid them.</p><p>My j ob bored me. My friends too. Suddenly I didn\u2019t fit in in the place I\u2019d been a part of my whole life. I spent most of my time searching the Internet, trying to find a trace of Katie somewhere. That is, when I wasn\u2019t looking equally hard for a trace of John.</p><p>When Edward called and offered me a j ob, I jumped at the chance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to hunt for your sister anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy not do so with the resources of the J\u00e4ger-Suchers behind you?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t think of a single reason.</p><p>The night before I was scheduled to leave for J-S training, I watched the sun set from my window and sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou need to stop searching for me, chica.\u201d</p><p>I spun around, the pure silver knife I\u2019d bought to replace the letter opener in my hand. John stood just inside the room.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look much better than I did. Oh, his black pants were pressed and his white dress shirt was spotless, but he was pale, with dark circles under his eyes; he\u2019d lost weight too. He\u2019d shaved off his goatee, but his five o\u2019clock shadow darkened his j aw, making him appear both dangerous and a little bit sad.</p><p>\u201cWho said I was searching for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise.\u201d His smile did not reach the deep blue eyes I just couldn\u2019t get used to seeing. \u201cThe woman knows everything.\u201d</p><p>I scowled, not only at the knowledge that he\u2019d spoken to her and not to me, but at the revelation Elise knew so damned much. I shouldn\u2019t be j ealous\u2014the two of them couldn\u2019t even touch without getting a migraine\u2014but I was.</p><p>\u201cShe told me to come here,\u201d John said.</p><p>My spirits fell even further at his words. He hadn\u2019t come because he couldn\u2019t bear to be away from me any longer, he\u2019d come because Elise had told him to.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never move on with your life unless you see the truth,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cWhat truth is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a monster, Anne,\u201d John began to unbutton his shirt. \u201cAnd I always will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you are. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really know.\u201d</p><p>The shirt slid to the floor; the fading sunlight glistened across his beautiful skin. He unzipped his trousers; the sound ripped through the heavy silence.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know,\u201d he repeated, \u201cbecause you\u2019ve never really seen.\u201d</p><p>He kicked off his shoes, shucked his pants, then stood before me completely naked. I couldn\u2019t even enj oy the view, because he was making me very nervous.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I should have done in the beginning.\u201d He glanced at the window. \u201cOnly a few more minutes.\u201d</p><p>I followed his gaze. The sun had disappeared; the moon would soon rise.</p><p>A crescent moon.</p><p>My fingers tightened on the weapon, and John nodded. \u201cKeep the knife handy. You never know what an animal might do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201d I slapped the thing onto the table. \u201cYou won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Anne! Don\u2019t be a fool. Pick that up.\u201d</p><p>I backed away from the table. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Fury flashed across his face, sparked in his eyes, and for a minute, I was uneasy. My unease increased when he strode forward, grabbed the knife and came toward me.</p><p>Despite his being stark naked and gorgeous, all I could do was stare at his long, supple artist\u2019s fingers wrapped around the hilt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>I lifted my gaze from his hand to his face. \u201cThat knife is pure silver, John. Every last inch.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, opened his fist, and stared at a palm that should be smoking but wasn\u2019t, then he looked out the window. The crescent moon hovered just above the horizon.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before I could protest, he pressed the flat of the blade to his chest.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>The knife clattered to the floor. \u201cThe\u2014the curse is broken,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJust like that? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Let me think.\u201d John turned away, seeming to forget he wasn\u2019t wearing any clothes. I didn\u2019t mind. \u201cMawu said I had to commit the ultimate sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her great-grandson times ten said you had to kill all the werewolves,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cYou haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe both methods are true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t die. Lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ultimate sacrifice was never my life,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cbecause it wasn\u2019t worth saving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it when you say that,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>He ignored me. \u201cIn not killing Katie, I gave up my chance to be free, and in doing so was freed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ultimate sacrifice, for me, was losing any chance I had to break the curse.\u201d</p><p>Why do we always think the biggest sacrifice is our lives? There are other things that mean a whole lot more.</p><p>Love. Happiness. Family. A future together. Did John want those things too?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cured?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to Montana, turn myself over to Elise. She can run all her tests and make certain I\u2019m human,</p><p>but\u2014</p><p>\u201d He looked at the moon again. \u201cI don\u2019t hear it calling me. I don\u2019t feel the pull. I don\u2019t have a taste for \u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped, cleared his throat, shrugged.</p><p>\u201cBlood?\u201d I asked, and he nodded.</p><p>John bent and picked up his pants. While he dressed, I waited for him to say something, anything, about us, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t let him walk out the door again without knowing how he felt.</p><p>\u201cAfter you go to Montana,\u201d I blurted, \u201cand Elise proves you\u2019re human, what will you do with the rest of your life?\u201d</p><p>John lifted his head and his gaze met mine. I couldn\u2019t read his eyes any better now than when he\u2019d hidden them behind dark glasses.</p><p>Then he reached out, snaked a hand around my waist and tugged me close. He brushed his lips across my brow, laid his cheek against my hair. \u201cI love you, Anne. You\u2019re the only thing that\u2019s ever mattered to me in two lifetimes.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened; at last I felt like I belonged somewhere, with someone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably never be a cheery fellow,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ll always remember what I did. I\u2019ll always need to atone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019re working for Edward.\u201d I nodded. \u201cI should too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your music\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan be practiced anywhere. There\u2019re clubs in every city in the world, and being a musician is a good way to get to know a certain element in most of them. You think Edward will hire me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Edward was no fool. He never had been. He\u2019d see the advantages.</p><p>\u201cWhere should we live?\u201d I wondered.</p><p>John lifted his head, touched my cheek. \u201cDo you really have to ask?\u201d</p><p>Two months later, after John had passed all of Elise\u2019s tests and was declared human again, we went through J-S training together, then got married in the Crescent City. We moved into John\u2019s apartment and let King manage Rising Moon.</p><p>Once I\u2019d looked at New Orleans and known I would never fit in. Ancient, ghostly, and magical, with the echoes of j azz floating on the sultry air, the place had become as much a part of me as it was a part of John. I couldn\u2019t imagine living anywhere else.</p><p>However, we weren\u2019t there very often. Edward sent us to cities across the United States and Europe.</p><p>We went everywhere together. The werewolves were up to something; they always were.</p><p>Katie had disappeared completely; I wasn\u2019t sure we\u2019d ever find her. But I\u2019d never stop trying.</p><p>HE AWAKENS SOMETHING WILD IN HER... </p> </body></html>"]
