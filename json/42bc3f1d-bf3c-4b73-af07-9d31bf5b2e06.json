He sank down on a stool at the bar and smiled. His friend Steven, the bartender, sat a beer in front of him.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I need this. Is it just me or were the customers particularly boorish today?\u201d \u201cIf by boorish, you mean assholes, then, yeah, they were.\u201d Steven grinned and set a bowl of peanuts closer.</p><p>\u201cHey, pretty boy! You off the clock?\u201d Sam, the manager, a man Nicky detested with every fiber of his being, leaned against the end of the bar, snarling at him.</p> <p>\u201cYes, Sam,\u201d Nicky replied. He tried desperately to hold onto his temper. Nicky needed this job, and Sam would love a reason to fire him.</p><p>\u201cYou better be paying for that beer, or it\u2019s coming outta your pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cKeep your shirt on, Sam.\u201d Nicky pulled out his wallet, or rather he started to pull out his wallet and discovered it wasn\u2019t in his back pocket. What the hell? He had a memory of jumping out of the shower, running incredibly late for work. He\u2019d pulled on his clothes and rushed out the door in a hurry, no doubt leaving his wallet lying forlornly on the dresser in his room.</p><p>\u201cOh shit, I don\u2019t have my wallet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Sam said with his usual nastiness. \u201cHow convenient.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky clenched his fists, biting back a sharp remark. He couldn\u2019t even charge it. Sam had refused to let him start a tab like some of the other employees. Nicky closed his eyes for just a second thinking of how satisfying it would be to slam Sam\u2019s face into the bar.</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake, Sam, it\u2019s just a beer. I\u2019ll put it on my tab.\u201d Steven frowned at Sam, as he wiped down the bar at the other end.</p><p>\u201cJust so long as it\u2019s paid for. Nobody gets anything for free around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the truth?\u201d Nicky muttered under his breath as the manager walked away. \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and tie that hair back before you come in tomorrow, or I\u2019ll make you wear a hairnet. Health Department\u2019s gonna close us down with all those pretty little curls of yours flying around everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Nicky flushed, embarrassed over his unruly, blond hair that absolutely refused to be tamed, no matter how much product he put on it. He meant to get a haircut yesterday, but he was running short on cash before payday. He\u2019d just have to tie it in a ponytail, sure Sam would make good on his threat if he didn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cDamn, Nicky, what have you done to Sam to make him hate you so much? I mean, he\u2019s a jerk, yeah, but with you, it\u2019s like he takes special delight in giving you a hard time.\u201d</p><p>Nicky sighed. \u201cYeah, I know. He asked me out a few weeks ago, and when I told him I wasn\u2019t gay, he got a little upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpset? He looks at you like he wants to rip your head off. Hell hath no fury like a gay man scorned, I guess.\u201d Steven laughed as he walked down to take his boyfriend another beer.</p><p>Steven was the first gay man Nicky had ever really gotten to know well, and he considered him one of his best friends. Steven had a very jealous boyfriend who came by the bar every night to give dirty looks to anyone foolish enough to hit on Steven. The boyfriend was even unfriendly to Nicky, simply because of the way he looked.</p><p>Nicky considered his good looks to be a curse, one he could gladly do without. He didn\u2019t like a lot of attention over his handsome face. Around age eighteen, when he realized he had blossomed into an extremely attractive man, his good looks only served to embarrass him. At five feet nine inches tall, he\u2019d been a little chubby as a teenager and started working out at a young age when he was subjected to teasing by his classmates. As a result, his body was as muscular and sculpted as a young Greek god\u2019s, if Steven was to be believed.</p><p>Steven had been trying to build his confidence for some time, insisting he get out there and find someone to date. \u201cGirls, boys, whatever! Just don\u2019t let all this go to waste, Nicky!\u201d He smiled, gesturing at Nicky\u2019s body in the tight jeans he favored.</p><p>Nicky blushed. \u201cNot boys, Steven. I don\u2019t have anything against gays\u2014not at all\u2014but I don\u2019t swing that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t knock it till you try it, babe. I could get you a date any time you say. You\u2019re what\u2019s known as a gay man\u2019s wet dream.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky didn\u2019t feel like anything special tonight\u2014just exhausted. He\u2019d had an art class earlier in the morning, spent the early afternoon cleaning his apartment and doing laundry. After finishing a grueling eight-hour late shift as wait staff in an upscale restaurant in downtown Atlanta, he only wanted to go home and go to sleep.</p><p>He finished his beer and started to get up when Steven came up to him again. \u201cHey, your admirer is back. Has he said anything to you yet? Made any moves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Nicky glanced over his shoulder at the young man sitting by himself at the corner table, staring at him. \u201cNo. Creepy, isn\u2019t it? He looks like he\u2019s about seventeen, but he\u2019s been in here every night this week, just staring at me until I get off work.\u201d</p><p>Steven smiled. \u201cLike I said, you have an admirer. This might be your chance to find out if boys are for you, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, even if I liked guys, which I don\u2019t, serving time for statutory rape holds no attraction for me in the least.\u201d Nicky stretched and yawned, almost unable to keep his eyes open. \u201cI\u2019m not going to find out what he wants tonight, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019m so tired I\u2019m about to pass out and I\u2019m not in any mood to fend off unwanted advances. Thanks for the beer, Steven\u2014I\u2019ll pay you back. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Steven nodded and waved, and Nicky made his way to the door. He glanced over his shoulder to see if the boy still watched. Sure enough his hazel-eyed gaze met Nicky\u2019s blue one almost curiously, certainly without any embarrassment at being caught staring. Nicky gave him a little disapproving frown as he walked out into the cool evening.</p><p>He\u2019d only walked about a block and was almost to the bus stop when he heard a noise behind him and turned quickly to see two men coming up fast out of a dark alley. That was the last clear memory he had for a very long time.</p><p>* * * Nicky let the voices flow over him without really paying much attention to what they were saying. Drifting in a lovely haze was easier. He couldn\u2019t seem to get his eyes open enough to see who it was anyway. He\u2019d just lie here where it was warm and soft and not think about anything. The voices were becoming annoyingly clear though. Despite himself, he listened to what they had to say.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why is this pet unconscious?\u201d \u201cNicky\u2019s just\u2014just resting, I think, and been awake for some time now. It\u2019ll be all right. The pet\u2019s only been turned for a short while, you know. They always go in heat right away.\u201d</p><p>In heat? Were they talking about him? Wasn\u2019t that something dogs did? Bitch dogs? What the fuck?</p><p>\u201cHmmm...pretty little thing. Beautiful long eyelashes. Her blonde hair would be nice, but it\u2019s cut too short. She\u2019s awfully flat-chested too.\u201d</p><p>There was a short laugh from the other voice, and a sudden blast of cold air as the blanket was pulled back. \u201cThat\u2019s because \u2018she\u2019 is a he! This is Marco\u2019s new pet.\u201d</p><p>A quick intake of breath followed. \u201cMarco! You turned Marco\u2019s new pet? There\u2019ll be hell to pay over this.\u201d</p><p>The voice sounded young and a little frightened by the mention of this Marco. \u201cI know, but what could I do? By the time I saw what happened, he was already cut bad. His pulse was so slow I thought he was dying! I had to do something quick, and I did the only thing I knew to do to save his life\u2014I turned him. Anyway, he\u2019s only the least little bit in heat for me. I never fed him, and the two of them are blood mates. Once he mates with Marco and then feeds from him, it\u2019ll overpower my bite completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better hope it does,\u201d the other voice said quietly.</p><p>Nicky went right back to wondering what the hell they were talking about again. Who was going to \u201cmate\u201d with Marco? Marco was a guy, right? Nicky sincerely hoped they weren\u2019t talking about him, because he definitely was not gay. He totally had no interest in \u201cmating\u201d with any guy. And did someone just mistake him for a girl? He knew he\u2019d let his hair get a little long, and maybe he had a bit of a baby face, but a girl? Nicky hated the idea someone would think he looked feminine. He once tried to grow a beard to make his young face look older than twenty. He shaved it off when Steven took him aside and apologetically told him the look wasn\u2019t working for him. The hair on his chin was so sparse it looked like blond pubic hair.</p><p>One of the voices spoke again, sounding excited. \u201cMarco\u2019s here. He just arrived.\u201d</p><p>Nicky tried to get his eyes open to see who this Marco was. He opened one eyelid a little to discover he lay on a table of some kind, wrapped in a soft, furry blanket. Several big, burly men he didn\u2019t recognize stood around him, falling back when a cold breeze swept through the room. Some of the men standing closest to him stepped to the side to let the newcomer move up next to him.</p><p>Nicky peeked up through his lashes to get a look at the newcomer and gasped aloud when he saw him. The heads of some of the men pivoted toward Nicky in surprise. He had no interest in them. All of his focus, his entire center of being honed in to the man standing beside him as if he\u2019d been waiting for this one person all his life and just hadn\u2019t known it until he saw him. All the light in the universe convened and decided to shine and sparkle on this one man. Who could he be? And why in the hell was he so attracted to a man?</p><p>Tall and muscular, Marco reminded Nicky of those muscle men he\u2019d sometimes seen on television. He was absolutely gorgeous, which was shocking, because Nicky\u2019d never thought of a man before in those terms. His dark hair was cut very short, and his dark brown eyes were fringed with thick, black lashes. Nicky had never been so drawn to anyone before in his entire life. He heard himself whimpering deep in his throat as he wanted\u2014no, make that craved\u2014the man\u2019s hands on him. His mind felt separate from his body, watching, horrified, at what his body did. Totally unable to stop himself, his arms reached out to the man, like a child begging to be picked up by his daddy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marco gazed down at him and reached out to put a hand to his cheek. He pushed his arms down and patted his shoulder, leaned over and whispered in his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Sweetheart? Apparently some kind of grievous error had been made. Horrified by his actions, but absolutely unable to control himself, Nicky rubbed his cheek against the hand like a damned puppy, trying to get his nose right up inside his palm so he could sniff him. My God, had he lost his mind? What had they done to him?</p><p>Marco stood very still, allowing Nicky to nuzzle his hand and stared down at him. Raising his head angrily, he rasped out a few words to the other men. \u201cWho did this to him?\u201d</p> <p>An interesting question and one Nicky would like to know the answer to himself. A voice beside him spoke up. Nicky was astonished to see it belonged to his stalker, the cute young man from the restaurant.</p><p>Standing by Nicky\u2019s head, he spoke up right away. \u201cI did, Marco. I\u2019m really sorry, but I had to turn him, or he would\u2019ve died. It wasn\u2019t a mating bite, and I didn\u2019t bite him too hard\u2014really. You can see he\u2019s in heat only for you, not me.\u201d</p><p>Marco growled down deep in his throat. Growled? Who were these people? Frightened, Nicky whimpered a little louder, and Marco bent down to whisper in his ear. \u201cHold onto me, sweetheart. Don\u2019t be frightened. You\u2019re in heat\u2014I\u2019ll take care of you soon, baby.\u201d</p><p>In heat? There were those words again, but they couldn\u2019t be talking about him, could they? His body managed to inch even closer to Marco and tried to rest his head against his chest. Marco\u2019s shirt was open, showing off his spectacularly sculpted abs. Incredibly, Nicky turned his head and licked them, starting low on Marco\u2019s abs and going all the way up to the space between his nipples. He half expected the man to knock him away. Instead he absentmindedly patted Nicky\u2019s head, putting his fingers into his hair and rubbing his scalp.</p><p>Marco made the growling sound again. \u201cHow could you have allowed this to happen in the first place?\u201d</p> <p>The boy\u2019s voice sounded miserable. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I was watching him like you told me. He was going home from work at the restaurant, and these two guys jumped out of nowhere. They held a box cutter on him. I headed over as fast as I could, but he acted before I could get there. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes when he actually fought them. They were both big dudes. He never stood a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s brave.\u201d Marco\u2019s voice glowed with pride as he rubbed Nicky\u2019s scalp and petted him gently. \u201cObviously, he has more courage than good sense. I suspected as much. That\u2019s why I sent you to look after him until I could come for him.\u201d</p><p>Nicky, who had been basking in the praise from Marco, didn\u2019t think he liked that last part much. He certainly didn\u2019t understand it one bit. Someone had been watching him? Looking out for him? What did they mean about two dudes who jumped him? He hadn\u2019t been jumped by\u2014 wait a minute\u2014a sudden memory of walking to the bus stop in the dark and a deep voice from behind him, gruff and menacing.</p><p>\u201cGive us your money, man, and don\u2019t take all day about it.\u201d</p><p>Nicky had whirled around to find a box cutter lodged against his throat, the tip biting into his neck. Afraid to move at first, he\u2019d been about to empty his pockets when he realized he didn\u2019t have a dime on him. Remembering he\u2019d left his wallet at home, he knew he was in deep trouble. These guys would never believe his excuses.</p><p>Making a sudden decision, he sucker punched the one closest to him. The idea sounded perfectly plausible in his head. The trouble came with its execution. The punch, when it landed on the biggest guy\u2019s face, was ineffectual at best. He just shook his head and frowned like a fly landed on his nose. When Nicky tried to turn and run, the other one caught him by the arm. He simply swiped something at his throat. Nicky felt a cold blast of air hit his neck, and he put up his hand to it. Instead of skin, he felt a gaping gash. He\u2019d tried to scream, but no sound came out.</p> <p>The two men turned and ran, leaving him sinking to the street, his blood spilling out onto the sidewalk. He clutched the skin of his throat, trying to close it together when someone else ran up and bent over him. Nicky turned frightened eyes up to see a young, dark-haired boy, the boy from the restaurant. Nicky held out a hand to him. Without a moment of hesitation, the boy leaned down and bit into his bloody throat. He sank his teeth right into the wound made by the box cutter, and Nicky passed out from horror and pain.</p><p>He knew nothing else until he woke up a few minutes ago in this strange place. He put one hand to his throat wonderingly. He felt nothing but smooth skin. Could it have been an awful dream?</p><p>Marco spoke urgently to the other men surrounding him. \u201cI have to mate with him and feed him right away. Is a room ready close by?\u201d</p><p>The young boy pointed behind him. \u201cThere\u2019s a bedroom ready through there. You won\u2019t be disturbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Marco said, picking Nicky up off the table as if he weighed nothing.</p><p>Holding him high on his chest, Marco rushed Nicky out of the room, down a dark hallway, and put Nicky down gently on the bed. Leaving him for a moment, he locked the door. Coming back to him, Marco tugged at his own clothing, keeping his eyes firmly fixed on Nicky. Nicky could only watch in awe as he stripped off his clothes.</p><p>Marco\u2019s body was even more magnificent than Nicky first thought. His skin was tanned a golden brown. His muscles rippled up and down his chest and arms. His cock was fully erect, long, thick and magnificent, jutting proudly out of the dark brown curls covering his huge balls and curving back toward his stomach. Something didn\u2019t seem right about it, though Nicky couldn\u2019t quite see what it was. As he came closer, Nicky\u2019s eyebrows sailed to his hairline. At the very base of the beautiful cock a round bulging ring encircled it. He wasn\u2019t exactly a connoisseur of other men\u2019s dicks, but it certainly looked odd.</p><p>Nicky, still feeling outside his own body, made those whimpering noises as Marco prowled inexorably toward him and stripped away the blanket. Nicky was shocked to see he was naked too, and like Marco\u2019s, his cock stood up hard and proud. Nicky looked down at it in horror. How could he get excited like this by another guy? This huge, gorgeous, gay guy was crawling into bed with him, and Nicky\u2019s own damn cock was enthusiastically beckoning him like a little whore.</p> <p>\u201cI...I want...I need...\u201d Nicky couldn\u2019t seem to get a complete sentence out for the life of him. He had things he needed to say and quickly before he got fucked by that huge dick, but he couldn\u2019t get a word out. Marco lay down beside him and took him in his arms.</p><p>\u201cShhh...hush baby, I know exactly what you need.\u201d Marco\u2019s voice soothed him as much as his presence did. Everything about him was so enticing and delicious. Even the smell coming off his skin was positively addictive. The scent of caramel and cream clouded his head so he couldn\u2019t think clearly. He wanted to lick Marco all over. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad after all to be fucked by this magnificent man. Just this once, maybe. No one would have to know, right?</p><p>Nicky lost all fear of what was about to happen as Marco\u2019s scent surrounded him, overpowering his senses. He wanted the man so much he hurt. He crawled all over the guy trying to get closer to him.</p><p>Pushing Nicky on his back, Marco looked down into his eyes. \u201cSweetheart,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to taste you for so long. This won\u2019t take long, because you\u2019re in such a hyper state. Hang on, baby.\u201d He bent his head and put his mouth over Nicky\u2019s cock, enveloping him in a sensation like he\u2019d never experienced before. Marco\u2019s mouth was warm, and he moved his tongue over Nicky in incredible ways. Nicky couldn\u2019t stay still in any way while the man sucked and nibbled at this most private part of his body. He bucked his hips and almost lost his mind, moaning and screaming.</p><p>Marco licked at his balls, and Nicky grabbed Marco\u2019s hair, hanging on for dear life. His cock sank deep into Marco\u2019s throat, while Marco swirled his tongue along the underside. Nicky came explosively, unable to prevent it, and the gorgeous man between his legs swallowed every drop.</p><p>Afterward, still licking his lips, he bent down to kiss Nicky tenderly.</p><p>\u201cNicky, try to concentrate. I\u2019m going to turn you over and mate with you. It\u2019s going to hurt some, but maybe a little less from behind. Do you understand?</p><p>Nicky\u2019s head bobbed up and down like an insane puppet. He felt totally drained, yet Nicky\u2019s body was in a fervent frenzy wanting to get fucked by this gorgeous man mountain.</p><p>\u201cBaby, this is going to be very intense. I\u2019ll try to be gentle and go slow, but you won\u2019t want me to go slow. I may get a little excited. You might be scared\u2014especially since you\u2019ve never been with a man before. Pretty soon you\u2019ll start the orgasmic cycle, and you\u2019ll have multiple, multiple orgasms. It may sound like fun, but they will be very strong. You\u2019ll probably pass out. Most pets do, but just try to ride it out and don\u2019t panic. I\u2019ll be here with you every step of the way. I won\u2019t let anything bad happen to you. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>Nicky\u2019s head nodded enthusiastically and those stupid whimpering noises came from his throat. His brain screamed out, No! I\u2019m not ready. What the hell are you talking about? Stop! I\u2019m not gay. Wait a minute, did he say \u201cpet\u201d?</p><p>Nothing his brain thought mattered to his cock, getting harder than ever before in his life in response to Marco\u2019s attentions. Marco spread some kind of oil on his hole, dipping his fingers right up inside his virgin little ass, but instead of cringing away, Nicky\u2019s traitorous body practically wagged its tail. He laid his head down and used his arm to push his ass back to take in more of the invasion, moaning in pleasure as Marco\u2019s delightful fingers reached a certain wonderful spot. Nicky rocked, using his arms to push his ass back, wagging to take the fingers deeper.</p><p>Where was this coming from? What\u2019s the matter with me?</p><p>Marco oiled up his gorgeous cock before he grabbed Nicky\u2019s hips to hold his ass still. Marco used more fingers inside Nicky to stretch and prepare him. Nicky\u2019s ass burned, but his breathing accelerated. He rocked and wagged his ass faster. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marco laughed a little and gently slapped his butt. \u201cBe still, baby.\u201d</p><p>He pushed his cock into Nicky\u2019s hole, forcing it slowly through the tight ring of muscle. Stars swirled around Nicky\u2019s eyes as he felt an intense pain unlike anything he\u2019d ever felt before. He screamed out, but Marco smiled sweetly back at him a split second before he bit him hard in the nape of his neck. Nicky screamed again and tried to get away from the sharp fangs sinking into his flesh. Held in Marco\u2019s strong arms, he was unable to move. He sobbed and moaned until an indescribable feeling of passion swept over him. Even though the pressure and stretching from Marco\u2019s cock hurt like a bitch, he made no attempt to crawl free. His body, acting independently, pushed back in an even more frantic effort to take more. The cock sliding deeper into him also filled him with the most intense joy. Marco pushed in farther and farther. Nicky thought he might split any minute, still his body acting on its own would not seek escape, shoving back, rocking, wanting more.</p><p>Buried to the hilt, Marco pulled out his sharp teeth and licked him gently over and over until the pain lessened. Marco said softly, \u201cTry to get used to the feeling of being filled up, baby. Just lie still and take it.\u201d</p><p>Nicky tried to, he really did, but his sluttish ass squirmed in a possessed state of its own and wiggled, seeking what more he didn\u2019t know. \u201cI...I can\u2019t...hold still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Marco soothed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out slowly and pushed back in, setting up a rhythm, rocking Nicky to his core. His own dick had gotten so hard, it throbbed in pain. He tried to push his hand under him to fist his cock, but Marco stopped him.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, baby. You\u2019ll come soon enough.\u201d</p><p>He continued his thrusts until he made the same little noises Nicky had been making all along. With a cry, he surged against Nicky, and Nicky felt something else pressing against his hole. Though already stretched to the max, Marco\u2019s fingers pressed, forcing something more still inside him. What felt like a small baseball had to be that ring at the base of his cock. Nicky cried out, and Marco immediately stopped, kissing him tenderly on the back of the neck.</p><p>\u201cBe still for me, Pet. This will hurt, but you\u2019ll be okay. You can stretch to take it. Just relax and push out against me.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the baseball sized knot against the base of his penis tight again. Forcing in an oiled finger, he stretched and working Nicky\u2019s tight asshole up, around, and over the knot. Nicky whimpered, moaned, and only then tried desperately to force his body to pull away. He couldn\u2019t move an inch. Marco held onto him effortlessly with his weight, not allowing him to move away while he used both hands to drive the knot in.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please...it hurts...I can\u2019t...\u201d his voice said while his stupid body pushed back, trying to take the knot in.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Pet. Almost in. Good boy.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, the large knot of flesh slipped inside with a distinct plop, moving past the tight ring of muscles at his entrance and left Nicky sucking air and trembling. His hole was so stretched it had to be tearing, and he was impaled and helpless even if he could have made his body obey his commands.</p><p>Fully inside Nicky, Marco moaned, laid full length over him, and without pulling in and out, rotated his hips, moving inside him. The huge, baseball-sized knot pressed directly against Nicky\u2019s prostate. When Marco moved his hips the slightest bit, or even when he breathed, his cock manipulated Nicky\u2019s prostate, building up an orgasm Nicky was helpless to control. A wave of pleasure, mixed with the passion the bite brought on, engulfed Nicky. Marco\u2019s climax built as well. Pushing up on his arms, his renewed his thrusts, surging even harder, the ring making Nicky\u2019s sweet spot sing. Almost immediately Nicky came, in a rolling wave of delight that went on and on. And on. And on.</p><p>He\u2019d never experienced such an orgasm before. No one touched his cock, but it didn\u2019t make the slightest bit of difference. His could feel his cum shooting out in spurts on his belly, soaking the sheets under him with each shuddering, stiffening wave of ecstasy. Marco\u2019s dick still firmly lodged in his ass, Nicky continued climaxing, his body pumping in wild spasms. He screamed, and Marco put one hand over his mouth, while the other rubbed his back.</p><p>Nicky\u2019s orgasm lasted a certainly record-breaking and scary length of time. Just when he thought he might be having a seizure of some sort, it began to ease off, totally exhausting him while Marco\u2019s cock was still hard as marble inside him. Shouldn\u2019t he be softening by now? Incredibly, almost as soon as the shocking orgasm finished, he felt another one coming on, one more intense than the last.</p><p>He panicked, awash in pleasurable but strong, intense spasms. Marco grabbed his flailing arms and held them behind him tightly, murmuring soothing words to him. Nicky couldn\u2019t stop; the wild thrashing of his hips wouldn\u2019t stop, and Nicky was sure this would kill him. He could no longer feel his cum spurting, probably because there was nothing left in his balls to spurt. He thrashed his head on the pillow and screamed until everything went black.</p><p>He woke up amazed to find he was still alive and Marco\u2019s cock, still in place, was as hard as ever. He was still impaled on a shaft of rock with the bulge of that ring pressing relentlessly against his prostate.</p><p>Marco bent down over his back and whispered in his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re awake, darling. Good. The orgasms are easing off some now. That last one only lasted two minutes. Just ride them out, honey. Ah, here comes another one.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, Nicky\u2019s hips bucked, and he spasmed into another one. Gritting his teeth, he held on tight, and in only about thirty or forty seconds, it began to ease off. Marco, however, was still rigid inside him, his knot and shaft.</p><p>\u201cWhat...what\u2019s happening?\u201d His words came out in a wheeze.</p><p>\u201cMaybe only one or two more, baby. We won\u2019t be tied together much longer. Hang on.\u201d Marco soothed him sweetly, rubbing his body wherever he could reach.</p> <p>Another one came and almost took his head off. What it lacked in length, it made up for in intensity. Nicky begged for it to stop, screaming and pounding his head into the pillow. Marco tightened his hold on him, crooning to him lovingly. When it eased, Nicky looked around at Marco in wonder, trying to catch his breath.</p><p>Marco kissed his nape gently. \u201cYou did very well, sweetheart. Try to catch your breath. You\u2019re mine now. All mine forever. We\u2019ve mated, and you\u2019ll never belong to anyone else again. You have to accept that. I know it will be difficult because I haven\u2019t had time to prepare you, but you have no choice, darling, because you belong to me now. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Hell no, Nicky didn\u2019t understand. What the hell was he talking about? Nothing had made any sense to him since he woke up in this strange place, and the only thing he could hold onto to keep his sanity seemed to be this man. He found himself agreeing as he turned his head to gaze deeply into Marco\u2019s eyes. He could deny him nothing. Nodding his head like the little slut he\u2019d apparently become, he sighed like a lovesick calf.</p><p>He was rewarded by another soft kiss and a sweep of Marco\u2019s tongue over his neck. Nicky shuddered and was afraid he was about to come again. Marco pulled his head away. He pushed his hand under Nicky\u2019s belly and wrapped his forefinger and thumb in a tight circle around the base of Nicky\u2019s cock, squeezing until Nicky settled down. \u201cNot again, sweetheart. It\u2019s too much. I\u2019ll let you come again soon, I promise.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d \u201clet\u201d him come? Since when did Nicky need someone\u2019s permission to come? Damn, his head nodded like a stupid puppet again, and Marco patted his shoulder. \u201cGood boy.\u201d</p><p>There it was again\u2014\u201cGood boy,\u201d like he was some kind of dog. Maybe he was dreaming\u2014 could he be dreaming? Part of him, his treasonous body, didn\u2019t really want this to be a dream. Marco was the only thing that seemed real, and the pleasure he gave him, was the only thing he could cling to in this chaos.</p><p>Marco\u2019s cock softened. He pulled his hips back slowly. The knot on his cock gave a little pop and a great deal of pain as it came out of Nicky\u2019s formerly tight little ass. Nicky, exhausted, destroyed, annihilated, couldn\u2019t move his head off the pillow.</p><p>Marco leaned over him, rolling him to his back, and Nicky\u2019s eyes opened despite himself. Marco smelled so good. Nicky wanted to crawl up in his lap and sleep. He wanted to go to sleep with Marco\u2019s dick in his mouth and suck on it like a pacifier. Not knowing where in the world that thought came from since he\u2019d never sucked a man\u2019s cock before in his life, he realized his mind still had no control over his body.</p><p>Marco bit his wrist and bright red blood flowed out onto Nicky\u2019s chest. Marco pushed his wrist up to Nicky\u2019s lips. \u201cFeed from me, little one.\u201d</p><p>Nicky did try to turn his head, but Marco wouldn\u2019t allow it. He took Nicky\u2019s head in one hand and pushed his wrist up to his lips. \u201cSuck me, Pet.\u201d</p><p>Body winning yet again over mind, Nicky sucked. The taste was not as bad as reason told him it would be. In fact, the blood was sweet and nourishing. He couldn\u2019t quite place the taste, but somebody really should figure this out and market it, because it was some great stuff. He sucked greedily, really getting into it. Marco allowed it, holding his wrist to his mouth for several minutes before he pulled away and gazed down into Nicky\u2019s sated, exhausted eyes.</p><p>\u201cEnough for now. How do you feel, pet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I...better, I think. Yes, definitely better. My head doesn\u2019t hurt so much. I\u2019m not so dizzy now, but I'm really tired. Don't want to move.\u201d</p><p>Marco touched his throat. \u201cGood. That's because you just fed. My blood will keep you feeling calmer. The wound from the box cutter that bastard used on you has healed up nicely. You don\u2019t even have a scar.\u201d</p><p>Nicky shook his head in wonder. \u201cBut how...how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory\u2019s bite changed you into werekin. It made you resistant to human ailments and conferred a supernatural rapid healing on your wound. You\u2019re not immortal, though we do live very long lives. You are stronger now, less likely to succumb to diseases, as long as you\u2019re fed and cared for by your mate, by me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marco wrapped the blanket around him. Nicky wanted to try to get cleaned up, but he didn\u2019t want to argue with Marco. Anything Marco wanted was all right with him. He just wished he could have a chance to suck Marco\u2019s cock. He so wanted to hold it in his mouth all night long. Good God, what was wrong with him?</p><p>Marco picked him up like a child again and carried him back to the table in the other room. He put his butt down on the table top, but still held him to his chest. Nicky whimpered and wrapped his arms around Marco\u2019s waist. He could hear the other men coming back to stand by the table. He hid his face against Marco as they discussed him.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. He\u2019s mine. We\u2019ve mated. We were tied together for over an hour by the knot, and he had multiple orgasms. More than I\u2019ve ever seen. I never saw any pet in heat so strong. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s a male bitch. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been with a male pet before.\u201d</p><p>Marco\u2019s calling me a male bitch? I don\u2019t think I like that too much.</p><p>Marco\u2019s voice came again. \u201cHe\u2019s my mate now, and no one touches him. He\u2019s fed deeply from me, and I\u2019ll feed and fuck him again in a little while once he regains some strength. In the meantime...\u201d Marco looped something around Nicky\u2019s neck, running a finger under it to make sure it wasn\u2019t too tight before he fastened it together. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing my collar now, and in the morning I\u2019ll have him tattooed. If all goes well, we\u2019ll have the Alpha mating ceremony tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Marco leaned down to brush his lips. The words he\u2019d spoken sailed over Nicky\u2019s head and made little sense he was so tired, so exhausted. He closed his eyes and snuggled closer to Marco\u2019s chest, embarrassingly aware of little sucking sounds he made with his mouth. Marco\u2019s thumb slipped inside his lips, and Nicky sucked it in greedily, using it as a pacifier. He was too tired to even be embarrassed any longer. Not as good as his cock, but any part of Marco would do in a pinch. He put both hands around Marco\u2019s fist, so he wouldn\u2019t remove it and drifted gently off to sleep.</p><p>* * * When Nicky woke up he was lying in another bed, wrapped up tightly in Marco\u2019s strong arms. His ass ached horribly, but mostly he was quite comfortable. He\u2019d never before had a feeling of such security and safety. Confused memories assailed his tired brain, but he pushed them away to think about later. Resting securely in Marco\u2019s arms was enough for the present, a thought he couldn\u2019t push away, the strangeness of it making him a little uneasy. He squirmed restlessly. Marco came instantly awake and alert next to him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it, little one? Do you need me to fuck you again?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Nicky cried in alarm, fighting what his body still wanted and his mind. \u201cUh, no, I think I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, baby, your body knows what you need more than you do right now. Let me get the oil.\u201d</p><p>He rolled over and reached into the drawer. Nicky tensed up helplessly, hating his weakness. He didn\u2019t know if he had the strength for any more, even though his body squirmed to get closer.</p><p>\u201cDon't worry, darling, it won\u2019t be like before. The tying up will only be for special occasions from now on. It\u2019s the knot or the gland that causes you to become multi-orgasmic. This time should be more about pleasure for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nicky said meekly. \u201cIt\u2019s just...you know...I\u2019m not gay. I\u2019ve never been like this with another man\u2014ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Werewolves don\u2019t have any particular preference. Sometimes we mate with men, sometimes women. It\u2019s never anything we know for sure until we find our blood match.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t understand. Did you say werewolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart. There\u2019s a lot you probably don\u2019t understand. You\u2019ve been operating off pure instinct for the past few hours, but I can\u2019t explain it now. Your mind isn\u2019t clear enough while you\u2019re still in heat. Once you come out of it, I can explain everything to you. For now, just relax and let me love you. It\u2019ll help to clear your mind.\u201d</p><p>He rolled Nicky over on his side and gently fit himself inside as Nicky\u2019s ass snuggled up to Marco\u2019s crotch with a mind of its own. With Nicky stretched out from their previous encounter, his cock slid in easily. Marco moved slowly and rhythmically, in and out, in and out until Nicky felt almost hypnotized from the motion. Marco was right; it felt so good this time. Nicky\u2019s prostate was being gently stroked, and he thought he would soon lose his mind with the pleasure.</p><p>Marco whispered foolish sweet words in his ear, calling him his baby and his sweetheart, and Nicky grew more and more excited. He shuddered, and Marco gripped his hands in his so he could hold on. The orgasm, mind-blowing and very hard, was more like a normal orgasm, and Marco followed him in a few moments. He lay joined with Nicky, softening, but not moving, and that was just fine with Nicky. He wanted to stay joined forever. After maybe twenty minutes, Marco bit his wrist, rolled Nicky onto his back and offered him his bloody wrist to suck again.</p><p>Dutifully, Nicky sucked hard, once again loving the taste of his blood and trying to lap up every drop, until Marco pulled away. \u201cEnough, darling. Go back to sleep now and when you wake up in the morning, you should feel almost back to normal, as normal a human as you\u2019ll be from now on.\u201d</p><p>Trying to ignore the last part of that statement for the sake of his sanity, Nicky tried to sleep. Marco said he\u2019d be back to normal, Nicky thought sleepily. Except for the fact his asshole was stretched to three times its normal size, and he was thoroughly, irrevocably, totally in love with a gorgeous, muscular man twice his size. A man who had a strange baseball-sized gland at the base of his penis, yet seemed to think it was perfectly normal. A man who called himself a werewolf and called Nicky his mate and his pet. Nicky was afraid to think about all the strange remarks Marco made to him about male bitches and being in heat, like some kind of dog or something. He remembered the way he licked Marco and sniffed his hand. Oh, God! Had they done something to him to make him something not human? Was he an animal now? Was he a werewolf? Marco had called him werekin before. What the hell was that?</p><p>He looked down at himself and saw nothing unusual. He shivered uncontrollably, his mind shying violently away from the thought of being changed into some kind of dog or wolf creature.</p><p>Marco gathered him into his arms again. \u201cIs there anything I can do for you, baby? To make you more comfortable? \u201c</p> <p>Nicky bit his bottom lip and cast his eyes down in embarrassment. He touched Marco\u2019s penis, and Marco laughed. \u201cOh no, you can\u2019t suck that, sweetheart, or I\u2019ll never get to sleep either. You\u2019ll have to be content with sucking my thumb again, I\u2019m afraid. Here, sweet baby.\u201d He rubbed his thumb against Nicky\u2019s lips. Nicky opened his mouth and accepted it with a sigh. He closed his eyes and let the sucking soothe him. He wouldn\u2019t think about anything else but Marco tonight. Maybe tomorrow he\u2019d try to figure things out.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Nicky awoke the next morning, alone in a strange bedroom. He sat up and looked around with interest, trying to figure out exactly what had happened to him. Was this some kind of hospital? If so, it was the most luxurious hospital room he\u2019d ever been in. The walls were draped with some silky fabric, and the bed was massive and soft.</p><p>He stretched and yawned, feeling sore and achy all over, certain he\u2019d been having what had quite possibly been the most ridiculous dream of his life. Weird. Maybe he\u2019d been in some kind of accident and hit his head. Yeah, that must be it.</p><p>He had to take a shower, and that was absolutely non-negotiable. A great deal of sticky stuff crusted his stark naked body. Suspiciously, his mind went back to his crazy dream, but he pushed the thought away. He\u2019d experienced wet dreams before, but he hadn\u2019t had one in years. Certainly nothing compared to what he remembered or to equal the quantity of crust on his chest and abdomen. Getting out of bed to cross to an adjoining bathroom, he thought by the way his ass ached and burned he must have sprung a good case of hemorrhoids. What the hell had happened to him?</p><p>He adjusted the water on the shower and got in, enjoying the steamy feel of the spray hitting his shoulders. As he soaped his face and neck he came across a thin, soft leather strap of some kind around his neck. What the hell? He started to take it off and then decided maybe it was some kind of new identifying thing the hospital was using. Weird. He\u2019d ask the nurse about it when she came in. He soaped himself up, shampooed his hair and began to feel human again. He paused, stricken with the notion. Why did he think that? He shook his head, not willing to even consider the possibility his \u201cdream\u201d had been reality.</p><p>After brushing his teeth with a new toothbrush and toothpaste he found on the counter, he wrapped a towel around his hips and drifted out to the bedroom, trying to decide what to do next. Maybe he should try to find some nurse or something and let them know he was awake.</p><p>The door opened and the young man from the restaurant, his stalker, walked in wearing jeans and a T-shirt. He regarded Nicky curiously, especially when Nicky\u2019s mouth fell open in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou! What are you doing here? I don\u2019t understand. Do you work here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. This is some kind of hospital or clinic, right? Where am I exactly? Is this Grady?\u201d</p><p>Nicky asked, naming a huge emergency trauma center in Atlanta. Before the boy could do much more than gape at him, a tall, gorgeous man appeared in the doorway behind him. Marco! The name screamed into Nicky\u2019s brain even as he experienced an almost overpowering need to run to him.</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetheart. I thought I could get back before you woke up. I moved you to my room last night while you slept. You weren\u2019t frightened without me, were you?\u201d</p><p>So it hadn\u2019t been a dream after all. Even as his heart leaped at the sight of him, a part of him, the still very human, still very straight part of him, shrank away from him in fear. \u201cBut, but I thought you were just a dream. I...I don\u2019t understand. God, I think I must be going crazy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marco came into the room and took his hand. Nicky wanted to pull away, but was absolutely incapable of moving though Marco\u2019s touch brought a measure of calm back.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d remember more once you were out of heat, but sometimes this happens. It can\u2019t be helped, but you don\u2019t have to be frightened, honey. I only broke away for a few minutes, because I have to make preparations for tonight, and you have to be...um...prepared for the ceremony. I promise I\u2019ll explain everything properly later this afternoon, when I have time. For now, you just have to trust me.\u201d</p><p>Marco took him by the arm, walked him to the side of the bed, sat him down, and sank down beside him. This close to him, Nicky couldn\u2019t think straight. The almost irresistible attraction from the night before was still working. What the hell was that smell? Nicky leaned into him and sniffed at his throat.</p> <p>Marco ruffled his hair. \u201cDo you trust me, baby?\u201d</p><p>Nicky nodded his head wordlessly. Putting his nose right up in the hollow of Marco\u2019s throat, he kissed him softly, breathing in the wonderful, calming caramel smell.</p><p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Marco said, smiling. He bent close and brushed his lips over Nicky\u2019s cheek and what felt like an electric shock went straight to Nicky\u2019s cock. \u201cOkay, do whatever Rory tells you, and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He rose from the bed and turned to the young man by the door. \u201cTake very good care of him for me, Rory. He\u2019s still pretty confused. They\u2019re waiting for him downstairs. Try to keep him calm, though\u2014he\u2019s very...um...excitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can hear you, right?\u201d Nicky spoke up from the bed.</p> <p>Marco turned around and smiled at him indulgently. \u201cGod, he\u2019s adorable, isn\u2019t he?\u201d he said over his shoulder to the young man. The boy whose name, presumably, was Rory, looked down at him dubiously.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, beautiful, and I\u2019ll try to explain everything. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t stay with you, but things are difficult right now.\u201d</p><p>With a smile he walked out the door, leaving Nicky alone with Rory, who stepped warily toward the bed holding a strap of some kind in his hand.</p><p>Nicky regarded him with suspicion. He was supposed to \u2018take care of him\u2019 for somebody who was waiting downstairs. \u201cStay back,\u201d Nicky said as Rory approached with the strap. \u201cWhat are you going to do with that? I won\u2019t let you beat me with it.\u201d</p><p>Rory looked shocked. \u201cBeat you? Why would I do such a thing? We don\u2019t believe in beating our pets, not ever.\u201d His tone was indignant. \u201cI was only going to attach it to your collar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy collar?\u201d Nicky\u2019s hands flew to his neck and felt the thin, leather strap Marco put on him the night before. \u201cIs that what this thing is? And that\u2019s a leash? Are you fuckin\u2019 crazy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt won\u2019t hurt.\u201d Rory\u2019s expression was very sincere. \u201cPets always walk on leashes. You\u2019re can\u2019t be allowed to run free. You could get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019ve been walking on my own for some time now, thanks, and doing just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, except for the other night when you got hurt by those two guys with the box cutter. You didn\u2019t do too well on your own then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that was totally different. They were trying to take my money, and...hell, it was different.\u201d</p><p>Rory walked up to the bed and stared down at him. \u201cI have to take you downstairs, and Marco will be angry at both of us if you\u2019re hurt in any way. I\u2019m taking no chances, and neither are you. So please don\u2019t fight me on this, Nicky. Let me put on your leash.\u201d</p><p>Stubbornly, Nicky shook his head. \u201cNot going to happen. I\u2019ll walk with you downstairs if that\u2019s what Marco wants me to do, but you can take your damn leash and stick it up your...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNicky!\u201d Marco\u2019s strong, disappointed voice came from the doorway. Nicky turned to see his eyes flashing. \u201cI forgot my notebook, and I come back to find my pet being unforgivably rude. You will apologize immediately to Rory and allow him to attach the leash. This is not the way I want my pet to behave.\u201d</p><p>Nicky was surprised and hurt by Marco\u2019s sharp tone. Up to this point, Marco had only used a loving, tender voice with him, and the idea of Marco being displeased made him squirm with embarrassment and unhappiness. Why was that? Why couldn\u2019t he tell them both to go to hell? He dropped his head and stared down at the floor.</p><p>\u201cNicky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry, Rory. Put the damn leash on me.\u201d</p><p>Rory clipped on the leash. Marco still stared at Nicky with displeasure. As the silence stretched out in the room, Nicky grew more and more uncomfortable, unable to meet his gaze.</p><p>Finally, Marco spoke, breaking the silence. \u201cNicky, I\u2019m trying to be patient with you, but I won\u2019t allow you to misbehave or use bad language. Your behavior reflects on me as your master. You\u2019re wearing my collar now, and you belong to me. Rory, please let me know if Nicky gives you any more trouble. If he does, I\u2019ll come and deal with him. And Nicky, if you cause me to have to leave my business because of your bad behavior, I\u2019ll be very unhappy. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>Rory and Nicky both said, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d at the same time and shot each other an irritated glance.</p><p>Marco turned on his heel and left without another word, and Rory tugged at Nicky\u2019s leash. \u201cC\u2019mon, Nicky, they\u2019re waiting for you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Nicky grabbed the leash and pulled back, bad temperedly, but stood up, looking down at himself. \u201cWell, get me something to wear. I can\u2019t go like this.\u201d</p><p>Rory looked confused. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are some pants by the bed.\u201d</p><p>A pair of skintight leather pants lay on a chair by the bed. He pulled them on. They fit, but barely, and showed every bulge, particularly the one in front. \u201cNo underwear? And where\u2019s my shirt and shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Pets never wear anything except pants inside the house. You really don\u2019t know anything, do you?\u201d</p><p>Nicky shot him another frustrated, eat-shit look and stood up. \u201cNo, Rory, I don\u2019t. Mostly because nobody ever tells me any fuckin\u2019 thing. You all talk about me endlessly, but nobody ever explains anything around here. You all just make cryptic little remarks and expect me to somehow know what the fuck you\u2019re all talking about!\u201d</p><p>Rory shifted his feet and blushed. \u201cShhh...don\u2019t make me have to tell Marco you used bad language like that. He\u2019d spank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpank me? Spank me? What kind of place is this? Who are you people? Damn it, I demand that you let me go home!\u201d He made a sudden jerk of his head, pulled his leash from Rory\u2019s hand and made a break for the door. For all that Rory was young, his relaxes were quick as lightning. He snatched the leash up and pulled back on it sharply, jerking Nicky off his feet to fall back on his ass on the floor.</p><p>\u201cOww!\u201d Nicky rubbed his neck and looked back at Rory indignantly.</p><p>Rory came over to help him to his feet and then pushed him down on the bed. \u201cOkay, ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said ask me what you want to know. But make it quick or they\u2019ll come up here looking for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, first of all, who in the hell will come up here? Who\u2019s waiting for me downstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tattoo artist. Don\u2019t you remember you have to get a tattoo? All pets wear their master\u2019s names on their lower backs. They have to have his pack number on there too. It\u2019s traditional, and you have to have one, so don\u2019t even argue about it.\u201d Rory stood over Nicky belligerently, his fists clenched as if ready for a fight.</p><p>\u201cA tattoo and a number? What is this place, some kind of concentration camp?\u201d He frowned at the determined look on Rory\u2019s face. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I have a choice, do I?\u201d</p><p>Rory tugged at his leash again, but Nicky pulled back. \u201cWait! Who are you people? What are you? What did you do to me? Please, I have to know!\u201d</p><p>Rory sighed. \u201cOkay, but quick, and then we have to go downstairs. We\u2019re the Dark Hollow Wolf pack, and we live in North Carolina. We didn\u2019t do anything to you, exactly. I mean, we changed you to werekin, but we had to do that. We couldn\u2019t just let you die, and besides you were fated to be with Marco, and you wouldn\u2019t have been able to resist him without making yourself absolutely miserable, so you would have been changed eventually anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re talking absolute nonsense to me again. Wolf pack? Werekin? What does that mean? What do you mean, pets? Why do you call me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Cause that\u2019s what you are.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cOur adopted pets are always humans.\u201d</p><p>The inside of Nicky\u2019s head spun, but one thing Rory said chilled the blood in his veins. \u201cHumans? Are you saying that you\u2019re not human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re partly human\u2014half of our parents are human, after all. We\u2019re all werekin, both wolves and pets. But for some of us, the beast is strong. We\u2019re called werewolves\u2014 shapeshifters. We are the true members of the wolf pack. Marco is our Alpha wolf, our leader. Many of the rest of us, both men and women are gamma wolves. You might think of it as sort of soldiers.\"</p><p>\"Why would you need soldiers? Are you in some kind of war?\"</p><p>\u201cNot exactly, though we do have enemies. We've been on the edge of an all-out war with the Hunters for over a century.\"</p><p>\"The what? The Hunters? What is that?\"</p><p>Rory shrugged. \"Monster Hunters. They think we\u2019re monsters, you see. They hate the wolves and want us all dead. They come for us from time to time and attack with silver bullets. It's the only kind of bullet that will kill a werewolf.\"</p><p>\"Like in the movies.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, like in the movies.\"</p><p>\"Who are these people\u2014these Hunters?\"</p><p>\"They get their name from an old hunter named Abraham Van Helsing over a hundred years ago who hunted all the Fae. Fae are the special ones, the shapeshifters and vampires, werewolves, and the like. Fae are not human totally, or they may once have been, but aren\u2019t anymore. Anyway, the Hunter\u2019s descendants carry on the tradition, and they hire soldiers of their own to engage us in battle from time to time. The last battle was over two years ago, but they'll come again. Once they've replenished their army. They always come.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"But who\u2014what are you all?\"</p><p>\"Shapeshifters, like I said. All the others here are just our pets or mates. All children are pets too, until they go through puberty, and it becomes clear what they are. They\u2019re either wolves or pets\u2014werekin. If they stay pets, then they become mates to the wolves. Unless, of course, the wolf\u2019s blood match is human.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt happens sometimes, like with you. Then the human has to become werekin with a bite. Now come. It\u2019s time for your tattoo and your grooming. You have to look your best tonight for your mating ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy what ceremony?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTonight you\u2019ll officially mate with our leader, Marco. It\u2019s a very high honor, and he\u2019s waited a long time to find you. You have to look your best for him.\u201d</p><p>Nicky allowed Rory to pull him to his feet and followed him slowly down the stairs. His mind raced with a million more questions, but he knew Rory wouldn\u2019t take the time to tell him more. He still didn\u2019t believe half of what he\u2019d already heard. Werewolves alone was too fantastic to be real. Shapeshifters and werewolves! He had to be dreaming or on some kind of weird acid trip. He didn\u2019t remember taking any drugs. Could someone have slipped something in his drink?</p><p>He followed along in a daze. Along the way they met others coming and going. The place seemed to be almost like a large hotel, with three floors connected by the stairs and rooms leading off the central lobby or hall. Not a hotel, though, or not a normal one anyway, because many of the people they met were half naked like Nicky, wearing a leash, following behind someone meekly, their eyes downcast. Sometimes it would be a female, following a man, but often it was a half-naked, leashed male following a woman.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place, Rory?\u201d</p><p>Rory looked over his shoulder at him. \u201cThis is Mountainwood, our home in North Carolina. It\u2019s a kind of compound, in a way. The whole pack lives together, but we have our separate bedrooms, of course, leading off the main common room and kitchen. It makes us feel more like a pack\u2014like a family. It\u2019s much safer too. You were brought here unconscious on the night you were changed. So you don\u2019t remember arriving at the compound?\u201d</p> <p>Nicky shook his head, not sure what he remembered. \u201cWhat does that mean, \u2018changed\u2019? You all keep saying that. What happened to me?\u201d</p><p>Rory sighed with exasperation. \u201cI\u2019ve explained all that. You became werekin. Marco\u2019s mate and a bitch in heat. His bite put you in a state of estrus or heat, to prepare you for the mating cycle. And then you\u2019re mated. For life. So now you\u2019re Marco\u2019s bitch.\u201d He gave the leash another tug. \u201cWalk faster, Nicky. We\u2019re already late.\u201d</p><p>Nicky followed him, actually feeling more docile as he walked slowly along. He suspected the leash made him feel calmer, more controlled. Apparently he was Marco\u2019s bitch, for real. Something dramatic had certainly happened to him. Never, before a couple of nights ago, would he have allowed himself to be pulled along on a leash, be multi-fucked by a man, and crave more.</p><p>Was this part of the \u201cchange\u201d they kept talking about? That and the insane craving to be with Marco every moment of the day? Shame and humiliation crawled over him, and he stumbled a little going down the steps. Immediately, Rory\u2019s hand shot out to steady him carefully.</p><p>\u201cSteady, now, Nicky. No one wants to hurt you. Don\u2019t be scared. We\u2019re only trying to help you get settled in.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, he clung to Rory\u2019s words as he watched the tattoo artist prepare his needles. He looked nervously to Rory for reassurance and Rory immediately pet his head, rubbing his hand through his scalp like Marco did so often.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay, Nicky. The tattoo will sting a little, but it\u2019s not too bad. I know how brave you are, so make Marco proud.\u201d</p><p>The tattoo artist smiled at him kindly too. \u201cJust turn over, dear, and I\u2019ll be as gentle as I can. If the needle gets to be too painful, tell me, and we\u2019ll stop for a while, okay?\u201d</p><p>Both Rory and the tattoo artist were kind, but they treated him like a not-too-bright child or actually a pet dog. Of course, to their credit, he\u2019d been sort of acting like one or the other since he\u2019d arrived. His mind did feel more connected to his body than during what he\u2019d thought was a dream, though, so that was a plus.</p><p>Nicky turned over onto his stomach on the table, and the artist began his work. They were right\u2014the pinpricks stung a little, but it wasn\u2019t anything he couldn\u2019t stand. After his first flush of panic and embarrassment at someone giving him a tattoo of Marco\u2019s name, like he was owned by him, he relaxed a little. Rory stood close, keeping his hand on Nicky\u2019s head.</p><p>When it was over, Rory held up a mirror for him to see himself. The tattoo, probably about two inches in diameter, held Marco\u2019s name and a number one in a lovely, flowing script, pretty, really. Nicky found he didn\u2019t mind too badly. It was Marco\u2019s name, after all. If that\u2019s what he wanted, he guessed it wasn\u2019t too bad.</p><p>\u201cI can do a small heart too, if you\u2019d like? Beneath the name?\u201d</p><p>Nicky looked up at Rory who shrugged. \u201cUp to you.\u201d</p><p>Nicky blushed and stammered. \u201cN-No, nothing else.\u201d</p> <p>Rory smiled at the tattoo artist. \u201cI think he really wants a heart, but is too embarrassed to say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d The tattoo artist bent himself to the task and in only a few minutes, he\u2019d finished.</p><p>\u201cKeep petroleum jelly on it until it heals, and tell your master immediately if any kind of infection develops.\u201d</p><p>Rory helped him off the table and led him from the room. \u201cNow to the groomers,\u201d he said, and tugged again at Nicky\u2019s leash.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and don\u2019t forget my shots. Maybe a heartworm pill?\u201d</p><p>Rory turned a concerned, puzzled face toward him. \u201cDo you think you need shots and pills? Are you ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d Nicky said. \u201cTake me to the \u2018groomers\u2019 and let\u2019s get this shit over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but you really need to watch your language. Marco will punish you for those cuss words. Pets are not allowed to use them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever,\u201d Nicky mumbled, following him down another long hallway off the common room.</p><p>Rory opened the door to what looked like a beauty shop, except it would have to be one in some kind of nudist colony, because almost everyone in the room except for Rory was half naked and wearing collars. A pretty little brunette came over to them and took Nicky\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cHello, Nicky. It\u2019s so good to meet you. I\u2019ve never seen a man as pretty as you before. You\u2019re so beautiful. Everyone\u2019s talking about it.\u201d</p><p>A couple of puzzling things were happening or rather not happening. First of all, a rather beautiful young girl stood in front of him, totally naked from the waist up, her breasts almost touching his chest, and his body wasn\u2019t reacting at all. He looked down at his cock, and it was peaceful in his pants and perfectly uninterested. What the fuck?</p><p>Secondly, he felt almost no embarrassment at standing in front of these people while halfnaked himself, wearing only a pair of skin tight leather pants. Was he just becoming accustomed to it? Or was he still in the middle of the weirdest dream he\u2019d ever had?</p><p>\u201cMy name is Tara, and I\u2019ll be your groomer today. Come in and sit down, dear.\u201d</p><p>Rory unclipped the leash, and the minute it came off, uneasiness stirred in Nicky. He allowed Tara to take his hand and lead him to a chair. Rory stood nearby shifting his feet until Tara took pity on him and said with a laugh, \u201cSir, you can wait outside if you wish. I promise we\u2019ll take very good care of him.\u201d</p><p>Rory retreated gratefully, and Tara turned back to Nicky, running her fingers through his hair. \u201cYour hair is so lovely. So curly and shiny. A true blond, right?</p><p>Nicky nodded, a little embarrassed by all this talk of his beauty. He\u2019d always been uncomfortable with the idea.</p><p>\u201cYour hair\u2019s so blond, and your skin\u2019s so creamy. Have you noticed that most of us have dark hair and brown eyes? It\u2019s rare that a master will choose a blond with those pretty blue eyes. They really prefer brunettes. Of course, if it\u2019s a blood match, like yours, Marco would have had no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll these terms you people keep tossing around are confusing to me. Please explain to me what you\u2019re talking about. What does \u2018blood match\u2019 mean exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry. I was a new pet myself, not too long ago, and I remember how confusing it all was at first. Listen, let me get you shampooed, and then I\u2019ll explain everything while I style your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just washed my hair in the shower this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good. Then let me spray it with some water to make it easier to style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty long. Go ahead and cut it as short as you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Marco said specifically it was not to be cut. He loves your pretty long curls. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take good care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what everyone keeps telling me. So far I\u2019ve been bitten, stripped naked, and tattooed, along with some other things I can\u2019t talk about in front of you. You can understand if I don\u2019t quite believe that statement anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, dear,\u201d Tara said as she sprayed water on his hair and ran a comb through it. \u201cLet me tell you what I know about the werekin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, now keep in mind I\u2019ve only been here a few months myself. My master is Tristan. He\u2019s very handsome and wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes took on a dreamy quality. Nicky wondered if his did the same when he talked about Marco.</p><p>\u201cHe first saw me working in a beauty shop in a small town not too far from here. We were a blood match too. That means, when a master sees a certain person, they just know instinctively that the person is for them. They can\u2019t help themselves, really. They have to have us and are miserable without us. We feel the same way about them too, once we see them and accept the idea. Do you remember when you first saw our Alpha?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, last night. It was the strangest thing I ever felt. I couldn\u2019t get close enough to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you two are a blood match, so his blood sang to yours right away. That\u2019s why you instantly recognized him. We\u2019re totally drawn to them, you see, beyond reason, beyond any human ties. We always go to them willingly and submit to them completely. At least at first while we\u2019re in heat. Our masters subdue us, make us submissive to them and the masters are all very skillful at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, back up. What do you mean \u2018master\u2019? As in slave and master? I\u2019m not going to be a slave for anybody, even Marco. They can all forget about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, dear, calm yourself. It\u2019s not like that. Masters are the wolves, the shapeshifters. Don\u2019t you know about that? The word refers not only to the relationship but to the hierarchy in the pack. The Alpha, ours is Marco, is the highest ranking member of the pack. Then comes his beta, or second in command. The rest of the wolves are gammas, and then come the pets. Pets are always the mates and submissive to the wolves. We call them \u2018sir\u2019 and \u2018master\u2019, and they take care of us. You see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of\u2014Rory was telling me something. Do you mean this is all for real? They actually turn into wolves?\u201d Nicky\u2019s voice took on a horrified tone. Surely this was all a crazy dream. Or was he truly mad?</p><p>\u201cOh yes. Big, beautiful wolves, who are very terrifying when adopted pets first see them. Certain members of the werekin or wolf clan become shifters when they reach maturity. When a baby is born, the parents never know if they are destined to be shifters or pets. It\u2019s not until they reach puberty that it becomes clear. It can happen to both male and female children. The ones who don\u2019t shift become pets for other masters. Since they were born to the pack, they don\u2019t have to wear leashes when they go out or be restrained in any way, like those of us who are adopted. The natural born pets don\u2019t seem to have the same tendency as we do to go feral. If the masters can\u2019t find their mate, their blood match, among the pack, they\u2019re allowed to adopt a pet\u2014like us. When they bite us, they turn us into werekin. Their bite and their blood literally change our body chemistry and DNA. We\u2019re healthier, stronger, and live longer, almost impervious to illness. We\u2019re always submissive to them. It\u2019s just the way it is. It\u2019s the way it has to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is some crazy shit, Tara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wolf packs are very old and have always lived side by side with humans, but we... humans...have never been aware. There are old stories about werewolves whose bite turns a human into a monster. These stories have some basis in truth.\u201d Tara\u2019s voice lowered, and her expression sobered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Nicky voice dropped to almost a whisper, too.</p><p>\u201cOur masters aren\u2019t monsters of course, but if a pet is not tamed right away, if he or she is allowed to too much freedom, they can become feral, very savage. They never shift, at least not totally, but their hair grows all over their bodies, and they become like animals. They have to make us very submissive from the beginning to prevent it from happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubmissive? Like some kinky sex thing? I\u2019m not into all that. Hell, I\u2019m not even gay, but Marco picked me! I don\u2019t like the sound of this whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be this way. Hundreds of years ago, when humans were bitten, they became quite violent and savage. The masters, the shapeshifters, learned to control this in the newer ones, or they would have had to be put down. Eventually, they managed to breed docility into the natural pets, and they developed other methods to train the adopted pets. We have to become submissives. It\u2019s the only way to keep the savagery out of our natures. Believe me, you\u2019ll be much happier if you\u2019re controlled. It makes us all feel safer. Didn\u2019t you notice when you wore the leash you felt calmer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalmer? I\u2019d have felt a whole lot calmer if I were somewhere else. Why didn\u2019t they let me live my life? Why did they do this to me? I don\u2019t want to be somebody\u2019s pet dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you\u2019re not a dog. Not at all. You\u2019re thinking of it the wrong way. They do use the canine terms, because they\u2019re wolves, after all, but it doesn\u2019t mean the same to them as it would to humans. Nothing degrading. The masters cherish pets and love us very much. Remember, all of them have family members who are pets\u2014their mothers or fathers and some siblings. The masters never adopt without careful consideration and then only when it\u2019s a blood match. They would never treat us with disrespect.\u201d</p> <p>She fingered his collar. \u201cThis is all about protection and safety. Once we\u2019re bitten, we become wolf-like. Not quite human anymore. We\u2019re only calm when we\u2019re being controlled. Collars and leashes remind us we\u2019re controlled by the masters. Otherwise, we\u2019d deteriorate into something utterly savage. Believe me, you don\u2019t want that. I heard a pet who escaped a few weeks ago wandered in the hills for over two weeks before the masters found him. He fought them savagely. Once we give in to our feral nature, it\u2019s almost impossible to come back. Especially for someone new to the pack. When the escaped pet was finally recovered, they said he had to be in heavy restraints for two weeks, and they\u2019re still not sure if they can save him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave him? From what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom turning into a wild animal, who lives only to feed on human blood.\u201d</p><p>Nicky\u2019s mouth turned dry, and he was silent for a moment. \u201cCould that happen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could, but I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t. You have a very caring master in Marco. He loves you and will always take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Marco\u2019s a guy, and he\u2019s not even gay. I heard him say he\u2019d never been with a male pet before. Why did he pick me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re his blood match.\u201d Tara shrugged expressively. \u201cHe had no control over it, just like you have no control.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWe love whom we love, and that\u2019s it. From the first moment he saw you, he could no more resist you than he could stop breathing. You can\u2019t resist him either. My master told me Marco first saw you two months ago and tried to resist you, because he found out you were straight and was afraid you\u2019d never submit well. But he couldn\u2019t resist. He made himself sick, and since he\u2019s our Alpha, the whole pack suffered. When he heard you\u2019d been injured, he dropped everything and rushed to your side. Wolves mate for life. There will never be anyone else for him but you. You\u2019ll never be able to love anyone else again, either.\u201d</p><p>Nicky sighed. \u201cHe saw me two months ago? He\u2019s right. I\u2019m straight, but with Marco...I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s different somehow. I\u2019d never seen him\u2014I would have known instantly. It\u2019s like a drug, an addiction. He\u2019s just so perfect.\u201d</p> <p>Tara laughed. \u201cI know. I feel the same way about my master, and Marco really is something special. Being the Alpha\u2019s mate is quite an honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there some other reason he waited so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure, but don\u2019t worry. He\u2019ll explain everything soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he wanted children?\u201d</p><p>Tara shrugged. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t worry so. Our pack is large and all inter-related. There are plenty of children to go around.\u201d She smiled at him in the mirror as she turned him back around. \u201cYou have to relax. Your fate is sealed anyway. You can\u2019t go back. You can never leave. I\u2019ve explained what will happen if you do.\u201d</p><p>\"Well, what if those Hunter people attack again? Would they kill me?\"</p><p>Tara nodded. \"If they could, they\u2019d kill all of us, but you're worrying too much. Our wolves will protect us. Always.\"</p><p>Most of the time Tara had been talking, she\u2019d been curling his hair with a hot iron and his back was to the mirror. Now she turned him around while she brushed and shaped it with her fingers and stepped back to let him get a good look. In shock as he looked at himself in the mirror, Nicky only half heard the last of what she said.</p><p>His mouth dropped open. There was an actress in an old late night television show he\u2019d seen once when flipping channels; Shirley Temple, and her hair always lay in her trademark tight clusters and ringlets all over her head. As Nicky gazed at himself, he could have sworn little Shirley was looking back at him. Not wanting to hurt Tara\u2019s feelings since she was so sweet, he gulped hard and smiled at her. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, in a choked voice. He looked like a damn girl.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly one more stop and you\u2019ll be ready. You have to be waxed. It will hurt a little but will remove all the hair from your body. It will help make you feel less beast-like, less wild and feral. Besides if you don\u2019t keep it waxed, it might start to grow out of control. This has to become a regular thing for you now. Remember, everything they do for us is for our own good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell, no, I\u2019m not getting my body waxed. Are you crazy? No way in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky,\u201d Tara said sadly. \u201cPlease watch your language and your temper. You really have no choice. If I have to, I\u2019ll call your master. He\u2019ll spank you for your disobedience, and you\u2019ll be waxed anyway. Isn\u2019t it easier just to submit?\u201d</p><p>Nicky put his head in his hands, and to his horror started to cry. Before all this happened to him, he hadn\u2019t cried since he was a little kid, and now he couldn\u2019t seem to stop acting like the little girl he looked like. Tara rubbed his shoulders, and he felt her breasts graze across his back. Still no reaction from his stupid, stubborn cock, which was apparently holding out for Marco.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to cry, Nicky. It\u2019s really good for you to give in to your feelings and get in touch with your feminine side. It makes you more docile.\u201d</p><p>Nicky gulped in shock. \u201cFeminine side, my ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky, please watch your language!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s another thing.\u201d Nicky sniffed hard. \u201cWhy do I have to watch my language and never cuss? Is that more control?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, in a way. When a pet curses and is angry, they are giving into their feral nature. It\u2019s a bad habit, and it can only lead to more anger and savagery. Your master will make you stop and won\u2019t let you have a temper tantrum. He\u2019ll spank you very hard and make you apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not just brainwashed by your master? Maybe this is all just a way to make us submit to them, make us grovel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Nicky, you mustn\u2019t think that. Please be careful not to let your wild nature overcome you. It can happen with some of us very quickly, especially when we\u2019ve just been turned.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed and gave up, too confused to fight anymore. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d She smiled in relief, and he allowed her to lead him to the back.</p><p>The next thirty or forty minutes were agonizing as hot wax was put on every part of his body and then stripped off, along with the hair. Luckily, he had little hair on his chest or back, so most of the hair came off his legs, arms, and groin. The ordeal left his skin pink and hairless, and he painfully limped along with Tara back to the door to find Rory.</p><p>Rory barely glanced at him as he clipped his leash back on and tugged him along behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I going now?\u201d Nicky asked listlessly. He was exhausted and felt like an emotional wreck.</p><p>\u201cBack to your room. Marco\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p> <p>At the mention of the Alpha\u2019s name, Nicky\u2019s spirits lifted a little, and his whorish cock stood up. He eagerly followed Rory up the stairs. Marco waited, sitting in a chair by the window, looking even bigger than Nicky remembered and twice as handsome. Rory nodded to him respectfully, unclipped the leash and backed out of the room. Nicky stood uncertainly just inside the door until Marco beckoned to him. \u201cCome here, baby.\u201d</p><p>Nicky fairly flew across the room and tried his best to crawl into Marco\u2019s lap, but Marco pushed him down to sit at his feet. Though he\u2019d called him \u2018baby,\u2019 he still looked displeased, and Nicky\u2019s heart thumped loudly in his chest.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad at me, Marco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time you called me Master,\u201d Marco replied in a soft, but stern voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Nicky said quietly. \u201cYes, master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake off your pants and let me look at you.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky dropped them quickly and pirouetted in place and his heart sank when Marco\u2019s response wasn\u2019t what he expected.</p><p>Marco watched him without a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been hearing some negative reports about you, Pet, and I don\u2019t like them one bit. It\u2019s been reported to me that you continue to use bad language, and you\u2019ve been a little rude. Is this true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you this? Was it Rory?\u201d</p><p>Marco put a finger to his lips. \u201cHush. I didn\u2019t give you permission to ask any questions. Now answer me. Is what I said true?\u201d</p><p>Nicky dropped his gaze and slowly nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to be lenient with you, Pet, because I know this is all new to you, and you were turned in unusual circumstances and not by your master. All of this can factor in. But you must stop the bad language immediately. Are you clear? It only leads to trouble. No more rudeness, either. I won\u2019t tolerate your being a brat. You represent me now when you go out, and it\u2019s not enough just to look beautiful on the outside. You must be beautiful on the inside as well.\u201d</p><p>Nicky dropped to his knees again and nuzzled his leg. He couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cYou think I\u2019m beautiful?\u201d He looked up at Marco flirtatiously.</p><p>Marco hesitated and then smiled indulgently, pulling Nicky up on his lap and settling him there, with a hand on Nicky\u2019s growing cock. \u201cYes, baby, I think you\u2019re very beautiful. And I think you know it. You\u2019re in danger of becoming very spoiled.\u201d He touched Nicky\u2019s curls. \u201cI love your hair, and this is quite nice too.\u201d He rubbed his hands over Nicky\u2019s slick, waxed pubic area. \u201cDid it hurt very much?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike a bitch...uh, like a bad word.\u201d he corrected himself.</p><p>Marco pretended not to notice his slip and continued to rub his hands over him. Nicky\u2019s cock throbbed, begging for more. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to fuck you and feed you again, baby. This will be your last feeding for a while. It will help you be strong for the ceremony tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nicky said eagerly. \u201cCan we do it now?\u201d</p><p>Marco smiled and surprised him by picking him up in his arms and taking him to the bed, apparently as aroused as Nicky and not wanting to even talk, wanting to have hot sex as fast as he could get it. Unzipping his pants, he pushed Nicky down on the floor to his knees, and moaned as Nicky\u2019s mouth immediately closed around him. Nicky\u2019s lips moved over and up and down his shaft, licking him, tasting him, sucking him, trying to consume him. He had no idea where the knowledge of what to do came from. He\u2019d never sucked a dick before and never even had it done much to him. Something instinctive took over.</p><p>Marco moved his fingers to the back of Nicky\u2019s head and held him there, taking control, holding Nicky still to thrust his cock into Nicky\u2019s mouth, making him take it deeper and deeper into his throat. Only when Nicky gagged, did he pull back out and allow him to take a few breaths.</p><p>Nicky wanted to resume, his mouth open and seeking. Marco pulled away and lifted him up to the bed, turning him over, directing and guiding Nicky to his hands and knees. Ready and waiting, his ass wiggled in invitation, and Marco smiled, rubbing his fingers over the cleft of Nicky\u2019s ass. He took the lube from the bedside table and applied it liberally to his cock before turning back to Nicky and preparing him. His finger swept over his hole, dipped and probed inside, stretching him, adding one finger and then two. Nicky moaned and gripped the pillow in front of him tightly, his ass shoving back when slick cock replaced fingers. Marco entered him slowly, with a long, deep stroke, stretching, filling, and making Nicky feel complete. Nicky rocked, wanting harder, deeper thrusts. Marco didn\u2019t hold back, pounding into him, making Nicky scream with pleasure. Marco moved again and again in a steady, forceful rhythm, burying himself to the glandular ring. Nicky matched his rhythm, shoving back with each push with one hand on the bed and the other on his own cock, squeezing and pulling.</p><p>Marco drove slowly in and pulled back, driving in over and over. No matter how hard Nicky tried to prolong the union, his body bucked, cum shooting out in long, thick streams. He called out Marco\u2019s name, and Marco followed him in climax, pump for pump. Collapsing on top of him, Marco rolled to the side, pulling Nicky with him, grinding his softening cock into the cleft of Nicky\u2019s ass.</p><p>\u201cI love those little whimpers you make, baby. They drive me crazy.\u201d He ground into him again. \u201cDo it some more.\u201d</p><p>Nicky obliged him and rolled over, licking Marco\u2019s chest. Marco laughed, catching Nicky under the arms and pulling his face up to his own. Nicky thrust his tongue inside Marco\u2019s mouth, tasting his sweetness until Marco lowered him to the bed and smiled to see him struggling to catch his breath. Giving Nicky a moment, Marco bit his wrist, offering it up to Nicky\u2019s lips. Nicky attached to it greedily, lapping at it and trying to catch every drop as it fell. After several minutes of allowing him to feed, Marco pulled his wrist away and licked at it a few times to heal it back up. Nicky\u2019s eyes followed his every move, always wanting more of him. When would he ever have enough?</p><p>\u201cNever, darling. It\u2019ll never be enough for you and me. We\u2019re blood mates.\u201d</p><p>Nicky looked up at him oddly. Had he spoken the words aloud?</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. I can sense your thoughts now. It takes a couple of matings for it to kick in, and it finally has. I can kind of hear your thoughts, and no, to answer your question, you can\u2019t hear mine. It\u2019s a one way transmission. I\u2019ll be able to keep up with you as long as you\u2019re close by, and I\u2019ll know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Marco nuzzled his neck. \u201cI totally own you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not fair. I mean, I don\u2019t even have my own personal thoughts anymore? What if I\u2019m angry at you or what if I\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo something bad? That\u2019s the point, baby. I don\u2019t want you to do anything bad. My job is to keep you safe and protected always. Even from yourself. The masters take their responsibilities very seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like I\u2019m a dog and a child? A damn puppy?\u201dTwo stinging slaps fell on his naked ass. \u201cOw! What was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCussing. I\u2019ll give you just a warning this time because you were surprised and still learning. Next time, you\u2019ll go over my knee. Now say you\u2019re sorry and be careful what you\u2019re thinking. I can hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Nicky\u2019s voice was sullen, but Marco seemed satisfied.</p><p>Marco put his arm around Nicky and pulled his head back around to face him. \u201cThis is hard for me too, Nicky. I don\u2019t want to hurt you, and I never envisioned my mate to be someone like you. When I first saw you, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone like me?\u201d Nicky\u2019s heart fell with a thump. \u201cIs it that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean, baby. A boy. Just a young straight boy, and I almost lost my mind the first time I saw you. I\u2019d never been attracted to that many boys before you. Though I\u2019ve had sex with men before, I never imagined I would take a man as a pet. The fragrance, the sight of you\u2014I thought I\u2019d lose my mind and throw you on the ground right there. I first saw you at an art show in Atlanta in Piedmont Park. I was in Atlanta shopping with my mother. She\u2019s an adopted pet and can\u2019t be out alone. I was keeping her company while my dad watched the game on TV back in the hotel. Then I saw you setting up some of your paintings.</p><p>\u201cThe blood lust was so strong I almost dragged you off into some bushes and bit you right then and there. I think I might have too, if my mother hadn\u2019t been with me. She saw what was happening and calmed me down. She went over to you and got your card and bought one of your paintings. When she got back and gave them to me, the scent was so strong on them I was miserable and sick for a week. My mother talked me into waiting until you got a little older. She said you told her you were only nineteen, and I had to give you a few years. When I was away from you, it was hard to believe you were so irresistible. I even got cocky about it and went to the restaurant where you worked. I sat across the room from you, and when you walked in I almost lost my mind again. I had to leave before you saw me. I couldn\u2019t wait. You being so young and a male couldn\u2019t be helped. I had to have you. I assigned some watchers until I could make arrangements.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWatchers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuards. Like Rory. To take care of you until I could come for you. I was afraid you\u2019d be hurt. You\u2019re so damned beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Nicky blushed, laughing. \u201cOh, you can cuss, but I can\u2019t, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. I know this is hard for you. I wish I could make it easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you watched me, did you? Why didn\u2019t you come over and introduce yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t trust myself. If you\u2019d reacted to me, like I knew you would, I\u2019d have taken you right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you watched me.\u201d Nicky flushed. \u201cEven when I went out on dates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was torture for me, but I could sense you weren\u2019t serious about them. I thought it would be a good idea for you to sow some wild oats, like my mother said. Get it out of your system if you could in two months, because you\u2019ll never be with anyone else again but me.\u201d</p> <p>Marco tightened his grip possessively on Nicky, and Nicky sighed contentedly, truth pouring out his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll never want anyone else but you, ever. It makes no sense, I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you want to ask me before tonight\u2019s ceremony? Any more questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I do think I understand everything that\u2019s happened now. I still don\u2019t quite believe it yet\u2014I keep waiting to wake up, and it\u2019s hard to take in all at once. Is there anything I should know about the ceremony tonight? Will I have to do anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust follow my lead. It\u2019s a great deal like a wedding ceremony. Except for the fact that my wolf might come out. I\u2019ll try to control it, but sometimes during strong emotion...Don\u2019t be frightened by it. My wolf would never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Nicky blushed. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d be getting married to a man, let alone a wolf.\u201d</p><p>Marco kissed the tip of his nose. \u201cNow be good and rest this afternoon. I\u2019ll be back around six to pick you up.\u201d He slid from the bed, dressed, and then moved to the door. \u201cBe a good boy and don\u2019t go outside the room without me or Rory,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cWe\u2019ve had reports of a rogue pack in the area.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Not the Hunters?\u201d</p><p>\"The Hunters? Has Rory been scaring you with that? No, baby, just wolves. Rogues. Rogue packs are undisciplined packs that are wild and rootless. There are a couple in the area we\u2019re concerned about. One group in particular has banded together, and we\u2019re a little worried they might issue a challenge to my authority. They wouldn\u2019t follow our laws. They roam around isolated areas, setting up camp wherever they can. Some of their pets are probably feral, because they\u2019re allowed to run wild. We\u2019re afraid that, with them in our area, these pets may try to hunt humans.\u201d</p><p>Nicky gasped in horror, and Marco crossed back over to him, taking his hand. \u201cMost wolf packs aren\u2019t like that, honey. We\u2019re shapeshifters, yes, but we only hunt animals. If we take a human, it\u2019s for a pet, a mate. Never to kill or hurt them. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Nicky nodded quietly.</p><p>\u201cUntil the rogue pack is out of the area for sure, I don\u2019t want you anywhere outside. They\u2019d love to get their hands on a pet as beautiful as you, and the leader\u2019s mate, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat...what would they do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, they couldn\u2019t hurt you, really, because you\u2019re changed now. Not exactly human anymore. They might try to hold you for ransom though, and use you to get some leverage over me. If they kept you away from me for too long, there\u2019s danger in that too. You could turn so wild I couldn\u2019t bring you back, not to mention the mental anguish it would inflict on me and thereby the entire pack. I don\u2019t want to frighten you, but I want you to be careful. Do you understand why we keep you so close to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTara explained a little to me while she was curling my hair. She said it\u2019s so we don\u2019t become savage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, yes, there is a great danger in that. Tara is fairly new here, too, and still learning. Her master must have explained it to her very carefully. I\u2019m glad you listened to her. Now, listen to me. Don\u2019t, under any circumstances, go outside while the rogue pack is in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Nicky nodded his head dutifully and meant it. He had no qualms about staying inside while monsters roamed the woods.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Rory came for him carrying a piece of white satin. \u201cThis is for you, Nicky. Marco wants you to wear it for the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Nicky took it suspiciously and shook it out. \u201cThis is a dress,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cI will not wear a dress.\u201d</p><p>He threw the fabric on the floor and stomped back to the bed to sit down. Rory picked it up and went over to him. \u201cThis is not a dress.\u201d Rory sounded indignant. \u201cIt\u2019s a traditional robe, and you\u2019ll wear whatever your master asks you to wear and like it. Now put it on or I\u2019ll make you put it on.\u201d</p><p>Nicky flashed a hot look at him. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare touch me. I belong to Marco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco sent me to get you. And don\u2019t forget it was me who turned you in the first place. I\u2019ll slap your ass if I have to and explain to Marco later.\u201d</p><p>Nicky jumped to his feet with his hands in fists. \u201cOh no, you won\u2019t. Just try it, you asshole!\u201d He swung at Rory and missed, falling into Rory\u2019s arms, but he jumped away from him and put up his fists again. \u201cFight me. Come on, Rory, fight me!\u201d</p><p>The door swung open, and Marco stood framed in the doorway. He took one look at what was going on and crossed the room in two steps, picking Nicky up and throwing him on the bed. \u201cRory,\u201d he said over his shoulder, not taking his eyes away from Nicky. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry, and so is Nicky, though he\u2019ll be making his own apology soon. Please leave us for now.\u201d</p><p>Nicky sat up in the middle of the bed and watched Marco\u2019s face for any sign of leniency. He knew he\u2019d fucked up and badly. He cleared his throat. \u201cI guess it wouldn\u2019t do any good to say I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course it would\u2014if you meant it. I think you\u2019re only sorry you got caught.\u201d \u201cI...uh...I didn\u2019t want to wear the dress. It\u2019s for a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a robe, not a dress. It\u2019s what I want you to wear, and you\u2019ll wear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a damn girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re anything I say you are. You\u2019ve been without a master for far too long, and now you\u2019re giving in entirely too much to your feral nature. I won\u2019t stand for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me wear that, Marco.\u201d</p><p>Marco took a deep breath, as if trying to gather himself before speaking again. \u201cNicky, do you care for me at all?\u201d</p><p>Nicky bit his lip. \u201cYou know I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen try harder for me. You\u2019re allowing the wildness in your nature to take over. It\u2019s traditional for all pets to wear the white robe when they go through the mating ceremony. All the pets, including the males. I wasn\u2019t trying to single you out or humiliate you. It means you\u2019re entering into a new life, becoming part of the werekin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou all keep saying this feral nature is coming out in me, but I don\u2019t feel any different. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Nothing has really changed for me in any way. Well, except for the gay thing.\u201d</p><p>Marco shook his head. \u201cNo, Nicky, it\u2019s you. You are changing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I get angry sometimes and irritated when Rory tries to boss me. That\u2019s not anything new to me. Maybe I do need to clean up my language, especially if it bothers all of you so much, but I can\u2019t stand this walking around on a leash. It\u2019s not this so-called wildness, either. It\u2019s the way I\u2019ve always been. I don\u2019t like people telling me what to do.\u201d</p><p>Looking worried, Marco shook his head. \u201cI know that\u2019s what you believe, but you\u2019re not thinking straight, Nicky. I\u2019ve been feeding you my blood\u2014you haven\u2019t had anything else to eat since you were changed, have you?\u201d</p><p>Nicky looked surprised. \u201cUh...well, no. I guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that strike you as odd? Doesn\u2019t the fact that you\u2019re drinking my blood seem odder still?\u201d</p><p>Nicky got a stunned expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cRight. You\u2019re not human anymore, baby. Not totally. You have to accept the idea and stop saying nothing has changed. Don\u2019t you see? Everything has changed for you! My blood is supposed to have a calming effect. It should be making you docile and sleepy and easily controlled, but you\u2019ve been anything but easy. You\u2019ve been fighting almost everything and everyone when I\u2019m not around. So far, I\u2019m the only one who can handle you. It shouldn\u2019t be like this, and I\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><p>Nicky grabbed Marco\u2019s arm and held on, his hands shaking. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to me, Marco? Tara told me about the ones who let their savage nature get the best of them. Am I going to become a monster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Even though upset with him, Marco put his arms around him comfortingly and kissed his temple.</p><p>\u201cTara said there was this one guy, and you\u2019re thinking you may have to...to p-put him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think such a thing! She\u2019s mistaken. We\u2019d never do that. We\u2019re treating him with female hormones to make him less aggressive. As for you, I\u2019m going to keep working with you and stay with you all the time if I have to. If I\u2019m the only one you respond to, then I\u2019ll have to take some time off and take care of you. Feed you more often. Whatever it takes. We\u2019ll get through this together, baby. I promise. There\u2019s a lot more we can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraining. Understanding what it means to be submissive. Or the hormones, maybe. I\u2019ve seen that work before. But that would only be used as a last resort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHormones? Female hormones? Oh my God!\u201d Nicky put his hands over his face and wept. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop freaking out. That would only be a last resort, baby. I\u2019ll increase your feedings first and use more restraints. Train you more. Please don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll work it out. I promised you I\u2019d take care of you, and I meant it. Now get ready and let\u2019s go down to our ceremony. I\u2019ll get a leash. Along with my presence, that should calm you. Please tell me if you start to feel agitated again.\u201d</p><p>Nicky nodded, walked closely behind him to the closet and held stone-still to have his leash attached.</p><p>Nicky looked up at Marco with a frightened gaze. \u201cBut what if nothing works, Marco? What if I\u2019m a mistake? What if I can\u2019t be like the others? What if I\u2019m more like that other guy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk that way, baby. You\u2019re not a mistake! I\u2019d never let anything happen to you. Not ever. If I have to, I\u2019ll take you somewhere and keep you safe. Just you and me. I\u2019d never leave you. I can\u2019t, don\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><p>Nicky stepped up close to him and laid his head on Marco\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cNow put on your robe, baby. We have people waiting for us downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Nicky slipped the robe over his head. Marco smiled approvingly and put his arm around his waist. They walked through the door and down the hall toward their mating ceremony.</p><p>Marco led Nicky down the stairs to the group assembled in the large common room. He stopped at the back of the room and unclipped the leash, laying it aside. \u201cStay back here, Nicky, until I call you forward.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky nodded, unable to raise his head even to look at Marco. He could feel the eyes of everyone on him, singling him out. Embarrassed and humiliated, he desperately wished this whole thing was over, so he could go back upstairs. Hearing a soft whisper beside him, he looked up to see Tara smiling at him from the back row. Seeing her friendly face made him feel a little better, and he raised his gaze to survey the room. Probably about a hundred people were gathered there, both wolves and pets, the pets all dressed in the leather pants. They all looked quite solemn, as befitted the occasion, but whenever he caught someone\u2019s eye, he was rewarded with a friendly smile.</p><p>He looked toward the front as Marco began to speak. For the first time, he noticed Marco was wearing a dark suit and looked very handsome. It occurred to him he\u2019d never before noticed anything Marco was wearing\u2014Marco\u2019s presence was so overwhelming, nothing else mattered. Or was it because, as Marco told him, his mind had been clouded before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here today to introduce my new mate to all of you. Nicky, please come forward.\u201d Marco held out his hand, and Nicky moved toward him like an iron filing to a magnet. When he reached the small dais in the front of the room, Marco gave him his hand and then pulled him to his left side, his arm tightly around him.</p><p>\u201cThis is Nicky, and I hold him to my heart in the hope that he will lodge there forever. I pledge to him my love and faith, and my promise to always care for him, always protect him. My soul has found its mate, and I will never forsake him. Even unto death, my heart will follow his.\u201d Marco turned to Nicky, seeming to be in the grips of a strong emotion. His face was flushed and his eyes glittered with tears. He bent down and kissed Nicky tenderly, and then he pulled away and gave Nicky a slight push to move him to the side. Shedding his clothes, he fell down onto his knees. Nicky watched in fascinated horror as his body morphed. He dropped his head, but Nicky could see his face elongating and changing. His arms lengthened and morphed as hair sprang out all over his body. In less than thirty seconds, Marco shifted into a huge silver wolf. He put back his head and howled\u2014an unearthly, strangely human-like sound that chilled Nicky\u2019s blood. He heard answering howls and dragged his gaze away to see wolves shifting all around the room in response to their Alpha\u2019s call.</p><p>Knocked to the floor, Nicky turned his frightened gaze back toward Marco, or what used to be Marco and was now a huge, scary animal. The huge, scary animal jumped on top of him without warning, putting its paws on his chest and lowering its mouth toward his throat. Too scared even to scream, Nicky closed his eyes tightly and waited for death, but instead he felt the wolf lick him from the bottom of his chin to the top of his forehead. Nicky met the wolf\u2019s gaze and saw Marco\u2019s beautiful eyes gazing back at him. He instantly relaxed, knowing in his heart Marco wouldn\u2019t hurt him.</p><p>He heard more howls before Marco leaped away and ran for the door, followed by his wolf pack. Nicky sat up slowly, still feeling stunned. The pets in the room calmly went into action, picking up knocked over chairs and generally straightening up the room as if nothing unusual at all had just occurred. Tara come up beside him and gave him her hand to help him up. He got up off his back and looked at her in wonder.</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cWelcome to the pack, Nicky. Get used to this\u2014it happens from time to time, whenever the wolves get emotionally charged. They\u2019re beautiful, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Nicky nodded, having to admit that even though the huge silver wolf frightened him at first, he was one of the most beautiful creatures he\u2019d ever seen, his coat glossy and thick, and his eyes expressive and human-like. He could hear them outside the compound, calling back and forth to each other as they ran through the woods.</p><p>He moved slowly back up the stairs to his room, having to stop along the way for the well wishes and congratulations of the werekin. The room seemed empty without Marco. Nicky slipped off the robe and put it across a chair. Then he slipped out of his pants and lay down on the bed. He lay in the darkening room, listening to the sound of the wolves and waiting for Marco to return, drifting into an exhausted sleep before Marco, not the wolf, slipped into bed with him.</p><p>\u201cPut your legs over my shoulders, darling,\u201d Marco told him. \u201cI want to see your beautiful face when I make love to you.\u201d</p><p>Nicky had barely complied before an already lubed, steel hard cock slipped into him. \u201cBy the acts of mating and vows spoken before my pack, you are my mate until death takes us.\u201d</p><p>* * * Waking next morning was difficult. Marco had kept him up half the night making love to him and making him feed until he was sated and almost unconscious with fatigue. By the time he allowed him to rest, his ass ached and burned, his limbs felt like jello, and his mouth was still making sucking motions as he wiggled his ass up into Marco\u2019s crotch and sank down into sleep.</p><p>He awoke to find Marco gone, and Rory sitting in a chair by the window, watching him closely.</p><p>\u201cHi, Rory,\u201d Nicky said, stretching. \u201cWhere\u2019s...uh...my master?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe council needed him this morning. There have been more sightings of the rogue pack,</p><p>some as close as a mile from the compound. Shawna, the mate of the one we captured, is back in the compound, demanding to see him. Marco is meeting with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Will he be back soon?\u201d</p><p>Rory shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to babysit you till he gets back.\u201d</p><p>Nicky frowned. \u201cDo you have to use that term?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Rory, why do you have to be such an asshole?\u201d</p><p>Rory raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou really haven\u2019t changed a bit, have you? I\u2019m a wolf\u2014don\u2019t talk to me like that.\u201d</p><p>Nicky sighed. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Rory frowned again. \u201cYou know Marco is worried sick about you, don\u2019t you? That makes all of us nervous and jumpy. Can\u2019t you even pretend obedience?\u201d His voice grew in volume, and he rose to his feet to stand by the bed, looking down at Nicky, his fists clenched.</p><p>Nicky looked up at him and yawned. \u201cGuess not.\u201d</p><p>Rory slammed his fist into the pillow next to Nicky\u2019s head. Nicky glared at him. \u201cGo ahead. After I break you in half, Marco will take care of the pieces.\u201d</p><p>The door opened, and they both turned tensely to see Tara standing there quietly with her mate, Tristan, behind her, waiting for Rory to invite them in.</p><p>Before Rory could react, Nicky smiled at her. \u201cHi, Tara, Tristan, come on in. Rory and I were just having a little discussion.\u201d</p><p>Tara glanced up for a moment, surprised, and Tristan glared at him with disapproval. Wolves and pets didn\u2019t have \u201cdiscussions.\u201d They obeyed without arguments.</p><p>Rory took a deep breath and spoke to them. \u201cCome in, Tristan, and your pet too. What do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco sent me to groom Nicky here in the room.\u201d Tara explained. \u201cHe said he\u2019d be in restraints most of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe certainly will.\u201d He sent a smoldering look Nicky\u2019s way and pulled cuffs from the bedside table. \u201cHold your hands out, Nicky.\u201d</p><p>Nicky hesitated a long time, debating if he would accept another humiliation. Fear stole over Rory\u2019s features, igniting fear in Nicky. He held out his hands, and Rory twisted his arms behind him and slipped the cuffs over his wrists, snapping them shut. His hands were now cuffed behind him. Uncomfortable and humiliating, as Nicky supposed was the point.</p><p>Rory turned to Tristan and Tara. \u201cI\u2019m stepping outside for while then. Please call me when you\u2019ve finished with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said quietly, eyes downcast.</p><p>Rory went to the door, but couldn\u2019t resist one parting shot before he stepped out into the corridor. \u201cThat\u2019s how well behaved pets act, brat. See if you can learn something from her while she\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Tristan gave him an equally disapproving look and unclipped Tara\u2019s leash.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pick up any bad habits, Pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>The two masters went out and closed the door firmly behind them.</p><p>As he closed the door, Nicky yelled after them. \u201cAssholes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky, please!\u201d Tara cast a frightened glance at the closed door. \u201cWhat if they\u2019d heard you?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and turned his back to hold out his cuffed hands to her. \u201cUnlock me, Tara. The key is in the bedside table. I saw it in there earlier when Marco took out some lubricant.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew wide, and she shook her head nervously. \u201cBut I\u2019m not supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTara, listen to me. Rory\u2019s gone for at least an hour. We can put them back on before either of them returns if you\u2019re scared. Come on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hesitating only another few seconds, she went over to the table, retrieved the key, and unlocked his wrist restraints.</p><p>\u201cThanks, babe. I hate those things. Now what have you come to do to me?\u201d</p><p>Tara smiled. \u201cI just really came for a visit. I heard at the ceremony last night that you were still having some trouble adjusting. I was a little worried.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you lied to Tristan and Rory? I love it!\u201d</p><p>Tara blushed and dropped her gaze. \u201cI\u2019m being very wicked. If my master finds out...\u201d</p><p>Nicky smiled and took her hand. \u201cWho\u2019s going to tell him? Certainly not me.\u201d He got out of bed and strode over to lock the door and winked at her. \u201cWe\u2019ll just say we have no idea how that got locked.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the window and looked out at the mountain range. He hadn\u2019t been allowed out yet. All he could tell about the area they were in was that they were very high on a mountain side, judging from the spectacular view from the window, and the compound was surrounded by dark and verdant forest. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful here. I\u2019d like to go outside and look around, but I\u2019m still on house arrest, I guess. Marco ordered me to stay inside while the rogue pack is out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Tristan told me the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho are they, Tara? Do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors, you know, nothing really substantial. Some of the mistresses, the female wolves who come to my shop were talking about it yesterday. They said some of them used to be in our pack, but ran away when they couldn\u2019t follow orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of orders?\u201d</p><p>Tara blushed again, and lowered her voice. \u201cWell, they didn\u2019t know I could hear them, I guess. They said it was about the pets. A few of the adopted pets couldn\u2019t settle in well, and their masters and mistresses took them and ran, so they wouldn\u2019t be so unhappy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and they keep coming around because it\u2019s really hard for them to stay completely away from the pack and the ancestral land. They feel it belongs to them too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I thought all pets had to be controlled or go feral?\u201d A cold doubt took root in Nicky\u2019s chest. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just me who has a hard time settling down with this submission thing. There are others too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, a few of the male pets in particular find it difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they just collar and leash us and tell us to shut the hell up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they can\u2019t very well let pets go wild, like the rogues want. They may seem okay on the outside, but if their tempers get the best of them they might hurt someone, and this way, at least, they don\u2019t have to put them down for killing some human. Pets who are uncontrolled are unpredictable, you see. Dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they don\u2019t even give us a chance? They locked that poor guy up because he refused to be controlled. God, will they do that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you give them a lot of trouble, Nicky, and then Marco would have to agree, and I don\u2019t think he would ever do that. He really loves you. Besides, you\u2019ve only just got here. They would give you much more time to settle in before doing anything so drastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, fuck that. I need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Nicky, you can\u2019t. I explained why. You\u2019re different now. You\u2019re werekin. You have a need to be with the pack, and you have to feed from a wolf. The need can\u2019t be satisfied any other way. And what about Marco?\u201d</p> <p>Nicky put his head in his hands. \u201cHell, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know! I can\u2019t leave him\u2014I\u2019d be miserable without him. I don\u2019t even think I can live without him now. Damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is apparently most of the issue with the rogue packs. Their mates can\u2019t or won\u2019t settle for submission, and they can\u2019t live without each other either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this guy you told me about? Marco said they were giving him female hormones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a kind of chemical castration, but they\u2019re not working too well. When he escaped, he and his mistress were living with the rogue pack. They say she might be their Alpha. Our wolves have them both back in the pack now\u2014she followed him back when he was captured. But they say she\u2019s miserable, and he\u2019s still really savage, fighting with everybody and everything they\u2019re trying to do for him.\u201d Tara sat up straighter with a sudden thought. \u201cMaybe the rogue pack is here for them. Maybe they\u2019ve come to help them escape again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I can\u2019t just stand by while the poor guy loses his balls, even figuratively. I couldn\u2019t live with myself. Think we should try to help him escape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, Nicky. If they caught us, they\u2019d punish us terribly. I don\u2019t want another spanking. Those things are terrible.\u201d</p><p>Nicky smiled. \u201cDid Tristan really beat you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was all on my bottom. He called it a spanking, and then he made love to me right after. I think he kind of liked it.\u201d</p><p>Nicky laughed out loud. \u201cI\u2019ll bet he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? Don\u2019t you hate them too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had the pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? As bad as you are and Marco hasn\u2019t spanked you yet? He must really spoil you very badly.\u201d</p><p>Nicky smiled again. \u201cI guess he does. I get fucked every chance he gets.\u201d He laughed. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>Tara sighed. \u201cMe too. I love it too. I guess it\u2019s because I love Tristan so much.\u201d</p><p>Nicky leaned forward. \u201cTell me, Tara, I\u2019ve got to know. Does he have one those gland things on the base of his cock?\u201d</p><p>Tara blushed prettily. \u201cOh my God, yes, a wolf thing. It almost killed me the first night. We were tied up for over an hour.\u201d</p><p>Nicky laughed. \u201cUs too! Some weird shit, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I love him, so I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s just a part of who he is.\u201d</p><p>They smiled at each other, and Tara got up to go. \u201cMy master will be coming for me soon. Let me put your cuffs back on.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d only just gotten them fastened when the door jiggled, followed by a loud, frenzied knocking. Tara hurried to the door. Rory rushed in, followed closely by Tristan. They, apparently thought Nicky had overpowered Tara, and escaped. Both looked a little chagrined when they saw Nicky sitting docilely on the bed in his cuffs. Tristan snapped Tara\u2019s leash on and led her out without even acknowledging Nicky. Rory, in a sulk, sat down, turned on the television and glanced over at him.</p><p>\u201cI thought she was grooming you. You don\u2019t look any different to me. Still as bratty as ever.\u201d</p><p>Nicky ignored him, quietly watching television and biding his time, refusing to be baited. He had to behave himself if he wanted to talk Marco into letting him have more freedom.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m talking to you, brat!\u201d Rory threw a wadded up piece of paper at him, hitting him in the forehead. \u201cSay, \u2018yes, sir,\u2019 when I speak to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss my ass!\u201d</p><p>Rory shook his head moodily. \u201cI hate sitting in here with you all afternoon. It\u2019s beautiful outside too.\u201d He looked longingly at the window.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go for a walk,\u201d Nicky suggested.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? Marco would kill me for taking you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to the gardens near the house. You can tell him I begged you to go\u2014he won\u2019t get mad. C\u2019mon, man. Like you said, it\u2019s beautiful outside. I\u2019ll even let you use the leash without a hassle. Anything to get out of here for a few minutes. I\u2019m going stir crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Rory said, looking longingly out the window. \u201cMarco said to stay inside. The rogue pack has been spotted nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will he know, Rory? I\u2019m not going to tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten he can read your mind, Nicky? Sense you, anyway. He\u2019d know for sure if we went out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I jam my signals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sing in my head or something. That should jam his radar a little. C\u2019mon\u2014just ten minutes. We\u2019ll stretch our legs a little. Get a little sun. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSing in your head, huh? You think that would work?\u201d</p><p>Nicky grinned. \u201cOnly one way to find out.\u201d</p><p>Rory smiled back at him, unbending a little. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go, but if we get in trouble for this, I\u2019m telling Marco you got away from me and ran outside. You really think the singing thing will work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I guess we\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>Rory muttered some cuss words under his breath.</p><p>Nicky shook his head. \u201cI heard that and back at you. C\u2019mon, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Rory got his leash and firmly snapped it on, his look daring Nicky to argue. Nicky didn\u2019t argue, keeping his promise, only too happy to be getting out of the room for a while, no matter what. After taking off his cuffs, Rory led him down the stairs and out into the warm, bright sunshine. Rory walked along the trail surrounding the big house, pulling Nicky behind him. As soon as they got out of sight of the windows, Nicky took hold of the leash, stopped walking, and jerked. Rory, strolling ahead and not paying any attention, landed on his butt on the trail. His look of utter surprise made Nicky laugh out of control, holding his sides and falling onto a bench by the side of the trail going through the garden.</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck did you do that for, brat?\u201d Rory jumped up onto his feet, looking around to make sure no one saw him fall. He was still young enough to be careful of his dignity.</p><p>When Nicky could speak again, he wiped his eyes and pointed at Rory. \u201cYou should have seen the look on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re gonna have a look on your face when I bust your ass!\u201d</p><p>Nicky stood up, twirling his leash in front of him. \u201cBring it on, Rory. Bring it on!\u201d</p><p>Rory stood with clenched fists, his face stormy, when a voice behind them made them both turn around. \u201cHey, Rory!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They both whirled toward the dark-haired young boy headed toward them. About fifteen years old, he wore the same leather pants as the other pets wore, but no collar and was unattended. He waved a bat, baseball, and glove at Rory as he jogged toward them. \u201cRory, do you want to play ball? My coach says I can play next week if I can improve my batting. Will you help me?\u201d He ran up next to them and looked Nicky over with interest. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Adam. You must be Nicky, Marco\u2019s new mate. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you. Gee, you really are as pretty as a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, thanks\u2014I think.\u201d Nicky smiled back at him. \u201cNice to meet you, Adam.\u201d</p><p>Rory nodded at Adam and back at Nicky. \u201cThis is my little brother.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky regarded him with interest. \u201cReally? So, Adam, you\u2019re one of what they call the natural pets?\u201d</p><p>Adam shrugged. \u201cGuess so.\u201d He watched Nicky twirling his leash in his hand. \u201cAre you supposed to be doing that?\u201d</p><p>Rory growled. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not. He\u2019s a jerk.\u201d</p><p>Nicky ignored him and stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll play ball with you, Adam. I played some in high school. I warn you, though, I\u2019ve got a mean curve ball.\u201d</p><p>Adam grinned and tossed Nicky the glove and ball. He ran back about twenty feet and took up a batting stance with his bat. Rory shook his head in disapproval as Nicky neatly unclipped the leash and tossed it at him before strolling over to toss the ball to Adam.</p> <p>Nicky pitched the ball to him for the next fifteen minutes, fielding the balls and calling out some tips from time to time. Rory stretched out on the lawn while they played and soon dozed in the sunlight with his mouth open.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Adam, are you ready? Here it comes\u2014my special curve ball.\u201d Nicky wound up and put his best spin on the ball, but instead of sailing over the plate as he\u2019d planned, the ball took a wild turn and shot off into the woods.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Adam yelled, laughing and ran off into the shadows beneath the trees. Nicky glanced up to see Rory still stretched on his back, sound asleep, expecting to see Adam running back. There was no sign of him.</p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d he yelled. \u201cCan\u2019t you find it?\u201d</p><p>No answer came from the shadowy woods, and unease swept over Nicky. He could sense movement in the shadows just beyond where the path disappeared in the pine trees even if he couldn\u2019t see it. He walked up closer, anxious and about to call for Rory when a burly arm shot out of the shadows. A hand clamped over his mouth, and the arm clutching him around the waist dragged him into the dimness of the trees.</p><p>Chapter Four</p> <p>Nicky decided they were definitely in some deep shit. He had no idea who these guys were, but he suspected they were wolves from the look of them, maybe some of the rogues. The two men who kidnapped him and Adam were moving fast down the trail, despite carrying Nicky and Adam over their shoulders. A damned uncomfortable way to travel, bumped and bounced along on the biggest one\u2019s shoulder. Nicky\u2019s hands were tied behind him, and they\u2019d stuffed a rag in his mouth, so he couldn\u2019t even yell. All he could do was jolt along on the guy\u2019s shoulder and try to keep an eye on Adam behind him. Adam was also tossed over the shoulder of the young, good looking man jogging along behind him. He didn\u2019t struggle as Nicky did, or at least it didn\u2019t seem that way from Nicky\u2019s vantage point. Maybe it was true that the natural born pets were more docile.</p><p>Nicky struggled so much at first it took both men to tie him up, and the big one who carried him had actually slapped his face a few times, drawing some blood on his lips. He could taste it, seeping around the cloth in his mouth. He hoped the bastard hadn\u2019t knocked a tooth loose. He concentrated on calling out for Marco in his mind, not knowing if Marco could sense him at a distance or not. He knew they needed some help and fast. Nicky hadn\u2019t liked the look in the biggest guy\u2019s eye when he finally picked him up and slung him over his shoulder. He had a feeling he was about to get fucked again in the very near future if somebody didn\u2019t intervene.</p><p>\u201cAaron, hold up,\u201d the younger one in back called out. \u201cLet\u2019s rest for a few minutes.\u201d The big one turned, giving Nicky a view of the trail in front of them for the first time. Not that he had any idea where they were. Wherever it was, the brush was thick, and the trail practically nonexistent. He shifted his aching stomach a little and got a hard slap on the ass for his troubles.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still too close, Cody. Two as young and pretty as these will have wolves looking for them soon. It was sheer luck they were so unprotected when we found them. This one here,\u201d he paused and slapped Nicky\u2019s ass again. \u201cThis one will be worth a pretty penny. No, we gotta keep moving.\u201d</p><p>He turned and returned to a tireless jogging. These men had to be wolves. They were so large and strong. They traveled along for at least a couple more miles, and Nicky despaired of Marco finding them. True, the men couldn\u2019t travel as fast burdened down by Adam and Nicky, but what if Rory hadn\u2019t woken up right away? What if he was still lying on the grass snoring and no one knew they were missing?</p><p>From somewhere far away, Nicky detected a delicious odor. Marco! Nicky bucked his hips wildly, trying to get the big one to stop. He ignored him, breaking into a faster trot, as if he smelled it too, bouncing Nicky up and down even harder.</p><p>Nicky grunted in pain as the guy\u2019s shoulder came in contact with the soft parts of his abdomen, making it harder to catch his breath. Suddenly from behind him, he heard a loud howl. The men heard it too. He was tossed down on the trail, landing with a hard thud on his stomach. Facedown and trussed up as he was, he could hardly see a thing. He lay for a moment, stunned, as he heard the two men\u2019s panicked yelling at each other. The big man hauled him back up into his arms, producing a knife and holding the sharp blade at Nicky\u2019s throat, with good reason. The trail and the forest beside it bristled with wolves of every shape and size, a big silver one right up front, flanked by a smaller one covered in black fur.</p><p>The sharp blade pricked against his throat and he stopped struggling. Getting his throat cut was getting monotonous, and he wasn\u2019t a big fan.</p> <p>Aaron, the one with the knife, yelled at the wolves. \u201cCome any closer and I\u2019ll slit his pretty little throat.\u201d</p><p>The wolves yipped and howled, and the big silver one shifted right in front of him. Of course, it was Marco. He was huge, naked and dangerous in his fury. Both hands in fists, he snarled out three words between his clenched teeth. \u201cLet him go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I don\u2019t think I can do that, Wolf. If I do, I have a feeling you\u2019re going to go for my throat. What do you say we make a deal?\u201d</p><p>Marco growled low in his throat with the other wolves circling around them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer\u2014I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>Marco, ready to lunge, was anxious, shifting tensely from foot to foot. Nicky feared Marco wouldn\u2019t be able to hold himself back, and he would suffer the consequences when the big dude let his knife slip. He\u2019d better do something fast to end this. Two things happened simultaneously. Nicky stomped down on Aaron\u2019s instep as hard as he could, and dropped. He made himself go limp, sagging down in a heap and pulling the big man off balance. The man fell on top of him and, incredibly, never dropped the knife. They fell together, still struggling. The man shifted his hand to catch Nicky around the waist, the point of the knife piercing his leather pants and puncturing his abdomen near his groin. Things happened quickly after that.</p><p>Aaron was torn away from him. One minute the man gripped him as they rolled to the ground, and the next he dragged Nicky a foot off the ground before his hold slipped and he was tossed through the air, landing an incredible ten yards away. Marco and the other wolves hauled Nicky to his feet, pulling the cloth from his mouth. Several hands patted at him, trying to discover any wounds. All the while Nicky could hear the sounds of a vicious struggle taking place nearby. Snarling and growling, punctuated by loud yells and screams for help came from right next to him, but too many people and wolves were in the way for him to see anything.</p><p>Not in pain, though he could feel the blood slipping down his thigh under his pants, Nicky was jerked around and stumbled. Marco put his face up next to his. \u201cWhy did you run away from me? What did you think you were doing?\u201d</p><p>Nicky couldn\u2019t quite understand what Marco said. Run away?</p><p>Marco shook him until his teeth rattled and then held him out at arm\u2019s length again. \u201cTell me! Why did you run away? I\u2019m going to beat you for this, Nicky! I swear to God you won\u2019t sit down for a week!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I...\u201d</p><p>Marco shook him again, viciously upset and not realizing his own strength. Nicky\u2019s head rocked back and forth violently. Things spun around dangerously, and then his knees refused to hold him up any longer. He sagged down a little. If he could only sit down for a minute. His knees gave away, and Marco caught him in his arms. Nicky winced in pain as Marco\u2019s hand grazed his wound, making him catch his breath. Marco lowered him to the ground and shoved down his pants, gasping when he found the deep wound still oozing bright blood. Marco put his mouth over the wound and bit down. Nicky fainted.</p><p>* * * He awoke back in his own dark, quiet room, in bed. He had a slight headache, and his side stung horribly, but he felt surprisingly good, considering all that had happened. Marco lay beside him and came instantly awake when he stirred. He propped up on one hand and gazed down at him with worry.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, honey? I\u2019m sorry if I hurt you. I shouldn\u2019t have put hands on you so soon after shifting and running after that asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m okay. A little sore.\u201d His hand strayed down to his side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s healed over. I took care of it, but it might be a little sore for a while.\u201d He looked down at Nicky, his expression serious. \u201cWhat if I hadn\u2019t been able to get to you in time, Nicky? What if he\u2019d had time to get you back to his camp? He meant to ransom you and Adam, but not before he\u2019d had his way with both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad his way with us? Damn, I mean, dang, Marco, it sounds like an old, very bad movie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMake no mistake, Nicky, he meant you harm. Why, baby? Why did you run away from me? I was hoping...I thought you were falling in love with me and settling in.\u201d Marco continued to stare into his eyes, but they shifted away a little with the last sentence, as if he were embarrassed to show he cared so much.</p><p>\u201cI am in love with you, Marco. I didn\u2019t run away. What makes you keep saying that?\u201d</p><p>Marco narrowed his gaze. \u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t get away from Rory and run into the woods?\u201d</p> <p>Nicky began to understand. Rory had lied just as he said he would to keep Marco\u2019s wrath off himself and put the blame squarely on Nicky\u2019s shoulders. He opened his mouth to set the record straight but hesitated. Maybe he could work this to his advantage. Having Rory in his debt might be useful in the future. \u201cOh, well, not really. I mean, I was playing ball with Adam, and he went to the woods to look for a ball. I went to look for him, and those guys were there. I fought them. See?\u201d He pointed out the cuts on his lips. \u201cThey hit me to keep me quiet.\u201d</p><p>Marco leaned down and licked the cuts slowly and sensuously, the feeling going straight to Nicky\u2019s cock. He moaned and held his lips for a kiss, but Marco leaned back, stroking his fingers down Nicky\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t explained why you were outside away from Rory to start with. After I told you not to even go out because of rogues in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, I just wanted to go for a walk in the gardens. Then we ran into Adam, and...\u201d He looked up into Marco\u2019s eyes. \u201cI was only having some fun.\u201d</p><p>Marco sighed. \u201cI want you to enjoy yourself, baby, but when I give you an order, it\u2019s for a good reason. My job is to keep you safe. I should punish you for not following my orders.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky bit his bottom lip and looked up at Marco, fluttering his eyelashes a bit. Marco smiled and leaned over to kiss him again, taking his time with it, sweeping over his lips with his tongue, and swirling it inside his mouth, leaving Nicky panting for breath. \u201cI won\u2019t though, because you\u2019ve been hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Marco.\u201d Nicky tried his best to sound humble.</p><p>\u201cUntil tomorrow,\u201d he said, grinning down at him. \u201cTomorrow, you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh...what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. Get some sleep, baby. You might need it.\u201d He dropped one more kiss on his forehead and lay back down, pulling Nicky close and wrapping him in his arms.</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you mean, Marco? Aren\u2019t you going to tell me? You can\u2019t just go to sleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHush. We\u2019re both going to sleep. We\u2019ll talk tomorrow.\u201d Marco closed his eyes and squeezed him gently, absolutely refusing to say another word. Nicky knew from experience all he could do was shut up and go to sleep. He sighed and snuggled back into Marco\u2019s groin trying not to think about Marco\u2019s threats about tomorrow.</p><p>* * * The next morning when Nicky awoke alone and naked in bed. He stretched luxuriously, rolled over and saw Rory sitting sullenly by the side of the bed, staring at him.</p><p>Nicky jumped, startled. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d He pulled the sheet more securely over him. \u201cHow long have you been sitting there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo long. Marco has put me on babysitting duty again because of yesterday. Believe me, I\u2019m no happier about it than you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to Marco yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Rory flushed. \u201cYeah. Sorry. It would take a lot braver wolf than me to tell Marco I was careless enough to go to sleep when I should have been watching you and Adam.\u201d He shifted around nervously in his chair. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him like that before. When he caught the scent of the Ridge Clan along with yours and Adam\u2019s...let\u2019s just say I was glad it wasn\u2019t me he was hunting down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that who they were? Ridge Clan\u2014what is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s another family of wolves. They live in the area, fairly close by, but the Mountain pack has always been at odds with them. We\u2019re pretty sure that\u2019s who they were. Shawna, one of our wolves from the rogue pack\u2014you know who I mean?\u201d</p> <p>Nicky nodded impatiently.</p><p>\u201cWell, she said it wasn\u2019t any of the rogues. So we think it had to be some of the Ridge Clan messing with us, trying to start something. Or maybe they just thought they could get some ransom money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard them mention ransom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did? That must have been some of their wolves then. The younger one, the one who had Adam, threw him at us and ran. We lost him in the forest. The other one, the one who had you, is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Rory shrugged. \u201cHe hit you, held a knife to your throat, planned on raping you. My brother heard him say so. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco k-killed him? Because of me?\u201d</p><p>Nicky shrugged, embarrassed. \u201cNo, Marco didn\u2019t kill him. I did.\u201d</p><p>Nicky raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou!\u201d</p><p>Rory flushed. \u201cYeah, me. They took you and my little brother\u2014I was angry. You were both my responsibility, and I didn\u2019t protect you. I didn\u2019t exactly mean to kill him, but he tried to use the knife on me too.\u201d</p><p>Nicky was very quiet for a moment, before Rory smiled gently. \u201cThank you, Nicky.\u201d</p><p>Nicky\u2019s skin colored, and he shrugged again, embarrassed at the attention. \u201cDid Marco sense me? Is that how he knew where to find us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He senses you pretty strongly, Nicky. He knows everything you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything? But last night, he thought I was running away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Only for a little while when I first told him you were gone. He was so upset he wasn\u2019t thinking straight.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cLast night he was probably seeing if you\u2019d be honest with him about the whole thing. He\u2019d already figured it out by then and tore me a new asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t exactly lie, but he did say something about training me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nicky. I should never have taken you outside. Then to fall asleep when I was supposed to be watching you was really stupid. You could have been badly hurt.\u201d</p><p>His apology was so sincere, Nicky was a little touched by it. Maybe Tara was right. The wolves did seem to care a lot for their safety. \u201cThanks, Rory. It was mostly my fault for talking you into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you feel that way, brat, \u2018cause I gotta put you in lockdown all day.\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco\u2019s orders. He thinks extra restraints might help calm you some. He ordered me to cuff you to the bed all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Fuck that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCussing again, too. He doesn\u2019t like that.\u201d Rory stood up and pulled the cuffs from his pocket, advancing on the bed.</p><p>After a brief but violent struggle, Nicky was cuffed to the bed and spitting curses. Rory kept calm throughout the tussle and never lost his temper. Nicky was impressed despite his anger. Rory was becoming a more dominant wolf every day, and Nicky was surprised at his strength. He sat with him until early afternoon, uncuffing him only to go to the bathroom and eat lunch. Nicky hated every moment of it.</p><p>Marco didn\u2019t return until around three o\u2019clock and immediately came over to let him out of the cuffs. \u201cHas he been in these all day?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>Rory lowered his eyes. \u201cYes, just like you told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He chafed Nicky\u2019s wrists and kissed his forehead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nicky. We restrain our pets to help them adjust. I know you hate it, but it\u2019s necessary. You\u2019re way too rebellious, and I have to take steps to control you. I can\u2019t let your feral nature take over.\u201d</p><p>Rory went to the door. \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t need me anymore, I\u2019ll get going.\u201d He left before Marco could say another word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still angry with him for his terrible lack of judgment yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Nicky stayed quiet, still seething over being locked in cuffs all day.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling? Any calmer?\u201d</p><p>Nicky wanted to be sullen, but Marco looked so worried, he wanted to make him feel better. He lied to him. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? I\u2019m picking up some untruthfulness in your thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like all this, Marco. I feel like I\u2019m in prison. Maybe this was all a mistake. Maybe I\u2019m the wrong kind of person for this to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Nicky. You\u2019re perfect. I just haven\u2019t had the time to properly train you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you were.\u201d Marco\u2019s tone was amazed. Nicky could see he had no idea how demeaning all this was for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a submissive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you are, darling. You just don\u2019t know it yet. Would you like me to show you?\u201d</p><p>Nicky squirmed a little on the bed. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d</p><p>Nicky kept his head down, refusing to make eye contact. The conversation was making him nervous. Marco put a knuckle under his chin. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me, Nicky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is say stop, and I will. I love you, and I want to show you how happy being submissive could make you, how good I can make you feel if you give yourself to me.\u201d</p><p>There was no use in resisting. He\u2019d do anything Marco asked. Nicky stared into his eyes. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Marco kissed him lightly on the lips. \u201cLie on your back with your arms over your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time like the present.\u201d</p><p>Marco stripped off his clothing and stood by the bed, gloriously naked. He pulled the sheet off Nicky and surveyed him from head to toe. \u201cIf you want to stop at any time, simply say so.\u201d</p><p>Nicky took a deep breath and nodded. He trusted Marco with his life. If he pushed him beyond what he thought he could stand, he\u2019d tell him to stop. The thought calmed the knot of fear in his stomach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nicky said, trying to appear composed and calm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tie your hands to the bedposts.

His cock certainly liked the idea, sitting up and paying immediate attention.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s get you tied to the bed.\u201d Marco pulled a length of leather strap from the drawer beside the bed. The mattress dipped down as Marco put his weight on it, rolling Nicky toward him slightly. Nicky held himself back from taking tastes and licks while Marco tied each wrist to a bedpost. With Nicky bound, Marco bent, and softly kissed Nicky\u2019s lips. He straddled Nicky\u2019s legs and moved down to his where his cock anxiously waited. Soft lips slid up and down, the heavy wet suction teasing an orgasm from Nicky\u2019s balls. Marco spent a long time moving up and down, taking Nicky far back in his throat, and using his tongue to lick the underside as he made his upward slide. When Nicky thought he was about to come, Marco pulled free with an abrupt sucking sound. Cool air brushed across Nicky\u2019s aching erection.</p><p>\u201cNo, Marco, more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby.\u201d His gaze was heavy-lidded, dark with desire. \u201cLegs up.\u201d</p><p>Nicky drew up his knees toward his chest. Marco pulled out a longer piece of leather. He looped it under Nicky\u2019s knees and tied both ends to the head board behind him. Nicky had never felt so vulnerable before, his hands tethered securely and his legs tied so his ass was up in the air. He whimpered in uneasiness, but Marco soothed him, caressing his legs and whispering sweet love words to him. He put some oil on his fingertips and eased one digit inside Nicky. Nicky bore down hard on the finger, remembering the fullness of Marco\u2019s cock buried inside him, desperate to be filled again.</p><p>Marco reached into the drawer one more time and pulled out a hard, rubber dildo. He slicked it with oil and pressed it gently against Nicky\u2019s hole.</p><p>Nicky shifted uneasily. \u201cNo, Marco. I don\u2019t think...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush baby, I\u2019m going to be gentle with you. Relax and let it in. It\u2019ll feel good, sweetheart. You\u2019ll enjoy it. We both will.\u201d</p><p>Nicky tried to relax and Marco gently eased the hard rubber inside him. \u201cPush out against it, honey. That\u2019s right.\u201d Finally, the tight ring of muscles relaxed, and the dildo slipped all the way in. The width of it was much like Marco\u2019s, filling and stretching him. Nicky drew in a deep breath. \u201cOh!\u201d The tip pressed against his prostate.</p><p>Marco waggled the end of it just a bit at the same time he bent over to enclose Nicky\u2019s shaft with his hot mouth, working the dildo in his ass and his mouth over Nicky\u2019s cock in unison. Nicky\u2019s climax was nearly at the breaking point. Bucking his hips to push himself over the edge, he yelled out his pleasure. Immediately, Marco put his hand in a tight ring around the base of Nicky\u2019s cock, effectively stopping his orgasm before it barely began, causing him to groan and plead, shudders still racking his body. Marco held the dildo very still, his thumb and forefinger tightly around Nicky\u2019s cock until he began to settle down. Then he slowly drew it out, causing Nicky to cry out. \u201cNo, no. I need...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh...I know what you need.\u201d</p><p>He untied the strap around Nicky\u2019s knees and pulled his legs around his own hips, fitting his cock neatly up into Nicky\u2019s aching opening. The blessed warmth filled and soothed him as Marco bent to kiss his lips and took hold of his cock. Moving his hand quickly up and down, at the same time Marco pumped his hips, ramming his cock deep into Nicky. In moments, Nicky came explosively, so hard it was painful, completely draining and depleting him. Marco came a moment afterward and fell down beside him, panting. He untied Nicky\u2019s hands and pulled him into his arms, holding and soothing him as the shudders still occasionally swept over his body.</p><p>Marco held him in his arms for over a quarter of an hour, soothing and loving him. \u201cNow do you understand what it means to submit? You\u2019re allowing me to pleasure you and pleasure myself at the same time. It\u2019s difficult to give yourself over to another man and let him completely own you. It takes a special kind of strong will and a great deal of trust. It\u2019s the most intimate type of relationship, I think, requiring complete commitment on both sides. You give me the control, and I commit to taking care of your every need and dedicate myself to you totally. Do you want that for us, Nicky?\u201d</p><p>Nicky thought about it for a moment. Yes, he wanted that kind of commitment, it was the whole submissive thing when they weren\u2019t in bed that he had trouble with. Wanting to totally own and be owned by Marco won out against his qualms. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>Marco smiled and pulled him close again. They lay in each other\u2019s arms and slept until it was time to go to supper.</p><p>When they woke and got dressed to go downstairs, Nicky broached the subject again of going outside. \u201cCan I talk you into letting me go outside with you? I see how beautiful it is here from the window, and I\u2019d love to be outside for a while. Maybe it would be okay if you take me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get enough yesterday?\u201d He sighed. \u201cWell, I guess that can be arranged. We can go for a walk now, if you want to, before supper. Will an hour or so be enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>Marco smiled down at him, his head cocked to the side as if listening. Nicky tried to make his mind as blank as possible not knowing if it worked or not. Marco moved away without any comment to give him a clue.</p> <p>Changed for walking in the woods, he said, \u201cI\u2019m taking you to a meal tonight, baby. I think you need some real food for a change and not just my blood. You\u2019ve been very good today, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go for our walk. You\u2019re right, you do need some exercise. Then we\u2019ll come back here and have dinner. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>Marco turned to regard him while he changed his shoes. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay, baby? You seem kind of subdued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you want, sir?\u201d</p><p>Marco looked surprised. \u201cUh, yeah, of course. It\u2019s just that it doesn\u2019t seem like you, honey. I kind of miss the little brat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I displease you, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not. I\u2019m sorry, baby. I don\u2019t mean to confuse you.\u201d</p><p>Nicky dropped his eyes, saying nothing, trying to keep his mind blank.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, are you ready? Put on your shoes and a light jacket. It\u2019s getting cooler outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Nicky got up dutifully and went to the closet to get ready, then crossed back over to Marco\u2019s side, waiting for the leash to be snapped on.</p><p>Marco put his arm around him instead, and they walked out into the waning sunlight and the cool mountain air. Taking Nicky by the hand, he led him down a winding path through the woods to a small lake. The afternoon sunlight shimmered across the surface like a scattering of diamonds. The mountains of the Blue Ridge rose just beyond, the haze in the air causing them to take on their characteristic hue. Wispy clouds rose up from the hollows, looking like smoke.</p><p>The sweet-smelling air was cool after being inside for so long, and Nicky shivered a bit in the breeze. Marco slipped his arm around him again. \u201cCold, baby? We can go back if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re beginning to sound like a Stepford Wife, and it\u2019s creeping me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want me to be docile and good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but not like this. I want my Nicky back.\u201d He turned and put his arms around his waist, bending his head to take Nicky\u2019s lips. He swept his tongue inside Nicky\u2019s mouth and nibbled on his bottom lip. Moving his hand down inside the waistband of his pants, he took hold of Nicky\u2019s willing cock and rubbed his thumb gently over the tip. \u201cThis is mine, isn\u2019t it, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d Nicky sighed.</p><p>Marco moved his other hand around to the cleft in Nicky\u2019s ass and moved his hand slowly up and down it. \u201cAnd this? This is mine too, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Marco looked around and saw a secluded area nearby behind some bushes. He drew Nicky over toward it. \u201cThen come and tell me all about it.\u201d</p><p>When he reached the spot, Marco tugged down his jeans and sat down on the soft carpet of pine needles, guiding Nicky in front of him. He quickly dispensed with Nicky\u2019s pants and spit onto his hands and then turned Nicky around to spread the moisture on his hole. Pulling him onto his lap, he impaled him on his dick. Nicky gasped at the sudden burning pain, but soon the pain turned to pleasure as Marco bounced him up and down on his cock.</p><p>\u201cTell me how much you love me, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I love you, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco,\u201d Nicky breathed. Then for several minutes, it was impossible for him to do more than moan as Marco\u2019s hips flexed, drawing in and out at the same time he moved Nicky up and down on his shaft. Each breath Nicky took made him tremble harder, and his heart raced so fast he thought he might pass out.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, baby.\u201d</p><p>Nicky turned his eyes toward him over his shoulder and met his beautiful gaze. Marco stilled his hands so Nicky settled down on his cock, leaning back against his shoulder, his hole rubbing up against the large gland on the base. His butt twitched and contracted around Marco\u2019s large cock as he tried to control his breathing.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re alone, I want you, only you, my Nicky. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll be very cross with you if you don\u2019t call me that when we\u2019re intimate, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, darling.\u201d Nicky smiled.</p><p>He moved him up and down again, and the pleasure doubled and redoubled inside Nicky until he thought he might explode. \u201cNeed, need it faster, please, Marco,\u201d he cried, moving himself, bouncing his body and jerking his hips, ramming the stiff cock in deeper and harder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marco\u2019s hands closed, one around Nicky\u2019s cock, the other squeezing his balls, sending Nicky over the edge, his cum erupting in thick spurts, arching in the air. Marco followed him seconds later, shooting so much sperm inside him, it leaked back out onto his lap.</p><p>Little by little, Nicky came back to himself, slumped tiredly on Marco\u2019s lap, still impaled on Marco\u2019s softening cock until Marco lifted Nicky off him. Settling Nicky beside him on the ground, Marco leaned over and took his lips again, sighing softly. \u201cI love you so much, baby. Do you have any idea how much?\u201d</p><p>Nicky gurgled an exhausted little laugh. \u201cWell, you can show me again if you give me a minute.\u201d</p> <p>Marco laughed and pulled him close, wrapping his arms more tightly around him so he wouldn\u2019t get chilled. After a few minutes, Nicky spoke again. \u201cYou know, Tara told me I was spoiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really? And how would she know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she gets spankings all the time and I never get any. She said I was much worse than she was.\u201d</p><p>Marco chuckled. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s right about that. So maybe I do spoil my baby too much. Maybe I should give some thought to regular spankings for you, just to keep you in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, that\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t want any. I just wondered if you spoiled me because you love me so much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh really? Well, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re pretty crazy about me.\u201d</p><p>Marco laughed and pulled him into another embrace. \u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>He kissed Nicky for a long time, and Nicky soon lost himself in his lovemaking, but a sudden noise in the woods behind them made Marco break away and jump up, growling deep in his chest. He pulled Nicky up behind him, backing away toward the compound. Frightened by his behavior, Nicky clung to his arm. The growls kept coming from his Alpha as he moved his mate to safety.</p><p>When they got farther away from the woods, Marco picked Nicky up and ran with him, his strength amazing Nicky. When he got to the door of the compound, he turned and set him down, punching in a code on the alarm by the door. Nicky didn\u2019t exactly know what was going on.</p><p>Marco leaned down to soothe him. \u201cYou\u2019re all right, baby. You\u2019re safe now, and nothing will harm you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what was it? What alarmed you so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rogues were near us just now. Snooping around us\u2014probably trying to get a good look at you.\u201d Another deep growl ground up from his chest, and his grip tightened painfully on Nicky\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cOw, Marco, you\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>Instantly Marco released some of the pressure, but didn\u2019t take away his hands. Other wolves were flooding the corridor by the doorway and spilling outside beside them, firing questions in alarm.</p><p>Keeping one arm tightly around Nicky, Marco turned to face them. \u201cThe rogues were just outside, after my mate.\u201d</p><p>Harsh sounds of growling and outrage resulted with one or two of the younger wolves actually howling in anger. Marco pushed Nicky to one of the men Nicky had learned recently was his beta wolf. \u201cTake him upstairs and to my rooms immediately. Post guards at the doors and windows.\u201d He dropped a kiss on Nicky\u2019s lips, then turned quickly to the other wolves. \u201cShift and hunt them down!\u201d</p><p>Nicky watched in fascination and a bit of horror as the men pulled off their clothes in a frenzy, throwing them all over the corridor. They dropped to their knees in front of him and quickly began to shift into huge wolves. His eyes were glued to Marco, his Alpha, the biggest of all of them, a beautiful silver gray wolf with burning eyes. Snarling and shoving each other, they rushed out into the night. Nicky stood silently, upset and frightened by the frenzied anger of his Alpha.</p><p>The beta wolf, whose name Nicky remembered was Ian, took him by the arm and led him upstairs quickly. Two more wolves fell in behind them as they walked up the stairs, and when they reached the room they put him firmly on the bed and stood around him, guarding him. Two others came in and stood by the window, looking out into the darkness.</p> <p>Nicky trembled and whimpered. Right away, Ian bent down to reassure him. \u201cNo harm will come to you, Pet. We\u2019d give our lives to protect you.\u201d</p><p>Nicky didn\u2019t bother to tell him he wasn\u2019t frightened for himself, but for Marco. The look on the Alpha\u2019s face had been vicious and terrible. He was afraid he\u2019d get in a fight of some kind and be injured. Or even be killed. The thought of Marco being killed, lying cold and still somewhere out there made him burst into racking sobs he couldn\u2019t control. The wolves standing around him had no idea what to do with him. They took turns patting his shoulder, careful to barely touch him only with their fingertips.</p><p>Relief didn\u2019t come until he sensed Marco close by. He could smell his distinctive caramel cream smell an instant before Marco came in the door and looked horrified to see the condition of his mate, curled up in a miserable ball, racked with shuddering sobs. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat have you done to him?\u201d</p><p>He gathered Nicky into his lap, and Nicky curled up around him still shaking badly.</p><p>\u201cNothing, sir! I swear it! He just started shaking and crying and none of us could calm him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave us!\u201d Marco yelled, and the room cleared quickly.</p><p>Marco held Nicky tightly in his arms, rocking him gently back and forth until he finally quieted. \u201cAre you feeling better, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes,\u201d Nicky gasped. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry and embarrassed. I never used to be like this. So, so damn needy and girly. I can\u2019t remember crying since I was a little kid. What\u2019s happening to me, Marco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ve been over feeding you, honey. I\u2019ve been trying to calm you, but perhaps I\u2019m trying too hard, too soon. My blood is nourishing for you, but it makes you nervous without me and scared to be away from me. I guess I need to just back off a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was terrified that something happened to you. I couldn\u2019t stand it if anything happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart, that\u2019s why I reacted so strongly too. The idea of the rogues taking you away from me enraged me. I shifted in front of you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, only the second time I\u2019ve really seen you do it. It happened at the wedding ceremony like you said it might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it didn\u2019t frighten you too badly tonight. Is that why you were crying so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. I thought it was amazing to watch you shift. You\u2019re so handsome even as a wolf. I was only afraid for you.\u201d</p><p>Marco laughed and kissed him. \u201cSo sweet. You\u2019ve had quite a night. I\u2019m going to take you to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said eagerly.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, baby. I meant to sleep. We\u2019ve had enough excitement for one night.\u201d</p><p>Marco picked up a disappointed Nicky and put him carefully under the covers. \u201cSleep tight, baby. I have to go back out to speak to the men for a few minutes, and I\u2019ll be right back. Will you be all right?\u201d</p><p>Nicky nodded, already feeling sleepy. Despite his eagerness for more sex, he was exhausted. He was almost asleep before Marco left the room.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>A strong hand took him by the throat and held on tightly, choking him. Nicky sputtered awake with a start, his arms flailing. A big hand clamped over his mouth.</p><p>\u201cGrab his arms\u2014he\u2019s fighting me. Watch out, he\u2019s kicking.\u201d</p><p>Nicky was fighting his unknown assailants with everything he had. Fear clutched at him as he realized no one but rogues would dare lay violent hands on the Alpha\u2019s mate. Hands all over him held him down and wrapped cords around his limbs. Another damn rag was stuffed in his mouth, and one of the dark figures threw him over his shoulder, taking him to the window.</p><p>\u201cHand him to me\u2014I\u2019ll take him.\u201d A hoarse voice whispered below him, and Nicky was lowered down to someone on the ground. Cold and naked, he dropped the last few feet, but ready hands caught him, preventing him from injury. Several dark figures gathered around him in the bright moonlight, lifted him up and ran. Nicky bucked his hips and struggled violently.</p><p>Looking back as they entered the woods, a window lit up, spilling golden light out onto the ground below. A loud roar of rage came clearly from inside. Marco!</p><p>One of the wolves yelled back up at the window. \u201cIf you follow, we\u2019ll kill him!\u201d</p><p>Trying to scream Marco\u2019s name around the rag stuffed in his mouth, Nicky\u2019s frantic efforts to wrestle free of the hands doubled until a sudden blow behind his ear knocked him to the ground. He heard an unearthly howl of anguish and outrage before another blow put out all the lights.</p><p>When he awakened, it was daylight. He was tied up in a bed of some sort, and furs tumbled on the bed over him keeping him warm. He tried to sit up and heard a voice from across the room.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. I thought you might have really hurt him. Why on earth did you have to hit him so hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; I just panicked. I heard Marco\u2019s howl from the window, and he sounded so close and so furious. I just wanted to get out of there fast. When Marco started to leap out that window, I knew we couldn\u2019t escape if he could hone in on him. The threat to kill his mate was enough to buy us a little time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d seriously hurt or killed his mate, he\u2019d hunt us all down one by one. There\u2019d never be peace between us. As it is, I can feel his outrage and his pain. It\u2019s very upsetting.\u201d</p><p>Nicky lay silently, unable to see who was speaking over the thick jumble of furs until a dark-haired woman appeared in his field of vision. He looked up at her curiously. She actually smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Shawna. I understand your name is Nicky. Is that right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded warily.</p><p>\u201cNo one is going to hurt you, Nicky. One of the younger members of our pack panicked last night and hit you to keep you quiet, forgetting his own strength. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Nicky cleared his throat. \u201cWhy-why have you taken me like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re Marco\u2019s new mate, and rumor has it he\u2019s pretty much obsessed with you. Blood mates, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would explain it. Since we took you last night, there\u2019s been great unrest in the pack. Even this far away we can sense the vibrations. He must be very distraught.\u201d</p><p>Nicky whimpered, uneasy at the idea of Marco being upset. Shawna looked at him strangely. \u201cYou feel it too, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Nicky nodded miserably.</p><p>\u201cThe raid was mainly for you, but we got another one of the females we\u2019ve seen you talking to, and she\u2019s very upset and crying a lot. Could you speak to her\u2014calm her a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Shawna nodded to someone behind her and a door opened. Nicky struggled to sit up as Tara, weeping softly with her arms tied in front of her ran over to the bed where he lay and snuggled up against him.</p><p>\u201cTara? Did they hurt you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shawna spoke up behind her. \u201cShe\u2019s just very timid. We\u2019re wondering why you were not as frightened and fought us so hard. Surely Marco has been feeding you. Are you, like my mate, one of the resistant ones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mate? The one in the basement cell?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, worry in her expression. \u201cThey haven\u2019t let me see him for days. I had to take you to use as leverage to try to get him released. I was inside the compound, you see. That\u2019s how I was able to let in my friends.\u201d She looked down at Nicky. \u201cPerhaps now Marco will be willing to negotiate. Trade my mate for the two of you. Her mate Tristan will be quite upset too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t release us both, a terrible fight will occur. They\u2019re probably out looking for us now. I\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t already come for us. Surely you must know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would have if we hadn\u2019t set off some small explosions right after we took the two of you. They had to stop long enough to put out the resulting fires, and that gave us time to escape. By the time they\u2019d got the fires in the compound under control, we were far enough away Marco and Tristan couldn\u2019t sense the two of you. We\u2019ve been rogues and outsiders for a long time. By now we know how to lay down enough false scent in the forest that they can\u2019t easily track us. They\u2019ll still find us soon, but we\u2019re fortified and have sent messages threatening to harm you both if they try to break in.\u201d</p><p>Nicky shivered and cast a nervous glance up at her. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t really kill us?\u201d Nicky asked softly, tightening his grip on Tara as she whimpered.</p> <p>She shook her head quickly. \u201cOf course not. Please don\u2019t worry. We can\u2019t hurt pets\u2014it goes against our natures. We\u2019re bluffing, but as far as my mate goes, they won\u2019t listen to reason. So far, the threats are holding them off. They still have my mate, you know. I think they\u2019ll be willing to set up a swap. We\u2019ve been trying to convince them they\u2019re wrong about the pets. My mate is not feral and never has been. They simply won\u2019t listen to reason. Now they\u2019re giving him unnatural hormones. You understand how desperate I am, surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco said pets who aren\u2019t dominated go feral.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head firmly. \u201cThat\u2019s just not true.\u201d</p><p>Nicky\u2019s interest sharpened. \u201cWhat? But how can you be so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen our mates proved resistant to submission, we had to run with them or they would have been put under restraints or in cells, or even chemically altered like they\u2019re doing to my mate. We waited nervously for something terrible to happen after we left the compound, for our mates to turn savage. It never happened. They refused to be dominated, but they weren\u2019t violent or wild. They wanted a normal relationship with their mates\u2014or as close to normal as we can be. We achieved that with them, and nothing terrible happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you account for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any idea. The notion that pets become feral if we don\u2019t force them to submit is centuries old and never really challenged. Some of our people have a theory that so many adoptions of humans have taken place over the centuries that at least some of our blood has become watered down\u2014infused with too much human DNA. When humans are changed, they\u2019re different from normal humans, but not that much. At least not enough to turn feral anymore. As long as the changed humans live with us and feed from us occasionally, they\u2019re fine. Again, it\u2019s just a theory, but the Mountain Wolf pack refuses to listen to us. They adamantly refuse to negotiate and keep saying the same old things they\u2019ve said for hundreds of years. Marco is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco\u2019s what?\u201d Nicky\u2019s tone was belligerent. No one could insult Marco in his presence.</p> <p>\u201cWell, forgive me, but he\u2019s the most stubborn wolf I\u2019ve ever met. He\u2019s so dominant himself; he won\u2019t even listen to any other ideas. He doesn\u2019t want to allow for any other lifestyles. We didn\u2019t want to have to resort to such means to get him to talk to us, but we felt we had no choice.\u201d</p><p>Nicky tried to absorb what he\u2019d just heard. Lord knows she was right about Marco being stubborn. Dominant too. Could she be right about the submission thing?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain that non-submissive pets never go feral if not totally controlled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sure. In the fifteen cases of resistant submissives in our pack, we\u2019ve never had one become wild, so long as they stay close to their mates and feed from them regularly.\u201d</p><p>Nicky was silent for a long moment. Then he spoke softly to Tara who still whimpered and moaned softly. \u201cHoney, I need to talk with Shawna. No one will hurt you, I promise. Just wait in the other room for me for a little while.\u201d</p><p>Shawna motioned to some other people in the room, and they led Tara outside.</p><p>Nicky leaned closer to Shawna. \u201cI have an idea. Take these ropes off me, and I promise I won\u2019t try to escape. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>* * * Marco paced up and down the room. He\u2019d have wrung his hands and pulled his hair out if he thought it would do any good. His mate had been gone for two weeks, with no sign of him. Marco was desperately afraid he might be gone from him forever.</p><p>A week ago, Tara had been brought back unharmed in exchange for the prisoner they held in the basement. A note had been thrown through Tristan\u2019s window the day before, advising they would have Tara outside ready to hand her over if a swap could be made. At first Marco wanted to hold out for Nicky\u2019s release too, but Tristan\u2019s abject pleas had softened him, and as the Alpha, he finally agreed, putting Tristan\u2019s needs ahead of his own.</p><p>When they recovered her, Tara was terribly frightened and distraught\u2014so much so Tristan had to spend over an hour with her calming her just to get her to the point where she could be interrogated. Even then, she was a mess, and Tristan sat beside her growling and whimpering uneasily, upset that his mate had gone without his protection for over a week. They all watched her carefully for signs of feral behavior, but found none so far.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me see Nicky much, but our beds were against the same wall in the little house they held us in. I could hear him at night. He called out for you in his sleep, Marco.\u201d Marco\u2019s wolf was very close to the surface. He growled and whined until the entire pack was terrified and upset.</p><p>When Marco calmed down, she tried to answer questions about where they were holding them, but she had no idea. They\u2019d covered her head both going and coming back to the rogue camp. Marco had been trying desperately to get a fix on Nicky\u2019s mind, but he couldn\u2019t. He could only pick up whispers and echoes. He knew that was a bad sign, meaning either that Nicky was unconscious or able to block him deliberately. Why would he do that? Had he gone completely feral? If he were dead, Marco would know, and he would have taken his own life. Living without Nicky was not an option.</p><p>After two weeks, he knew Nicky might be lost to him, even if he were found alive. Nicky had been so resistant to domination, he was in danger of becoming feral even with Marco\u2019s constant feedings and sexual matings. Without either of these things, he feared Nicky was lost to the wildness. If that was the case, and if he could find him, he\u2019d still take care of him, even if he had to take him away deep in the woods to live out their lives somewhere. He\u2019d never forsake him, no matter what his condition.</p><p>A knock on the door to his office roused him, and he went dispiritedly to answer. Rory was there, holding a note addressed to Marco.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from them! The rogues! They say they\u2019re willing to negotiate, but we\u2019re afraid it\u2019s a trap. They say you have to come alone today to Turtle Rock. They\u2019ll have Nicky with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you can get there.\u201d Marco sprinted past Rory through the door. \u201cWait, Marco! It could be a trap!\u201d</p><p>Marco hurried past him and out the door. Several members of the pack wanted to accompany him, but he shook his head. \u201cThey said to come alone, and if there\u2019s any chance to get Nicky back, I have to take it. If I don\u2019t come back in an hour, come looking for us.\u201d</p><p>He ran out the door and took the path to Turtle Rock. The idea of soon being with Nicky energized and excited him. He didn\u2019t think he could have lasted much longer.</p><p>Turtle Rock was not far from the compound down a trail leading off the gardens, maybe a half mile through the deep woods. He shifted into his wolf to cover the distance faster. The wind in the trees sang to him as he raced along, the scents of the woods sharp in his nose. He felt the wildness and the freedom that only came with shifting. All his attention was focused on Nicky, and he tried his best to sense him in the forest ahead. He reached out with his mind, and finally he got just the slightest trace of his Nicky reaching back. Heartened by the idea he might actually see him in only minutes, he raced through the trees, slowing down as he came up to the clearing that held Turtle Rock.</p><p>He could sense the presence of strangers ahead, and one former member of his pack\u2014 Shawna, the shapeshifting female wolf whose mate had gone feral. They had determined Shawna had been the one who helped disguise the scent of the rogue wolves by dressing them in pack clothing and letting them in an unguarded side door. Furious with her, he hoped he didn\u2019t run into her alone. He might not be able to restrain himself from tearing out her throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shifted to human and walked into the clearing slowly and carefully, his head pivoting back and forth, looking for rogues. From his left, three rogues stepped out of the trees. A low growl came from his throat. \u201cWhere\u2019s my mate?\u201d</p><p>One of the rogue males stepped forward, surprising Marco by lowering his head respectfully. \u201cHe\u2019s in the cave behind the clearing, Alpha. He\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to run behind the clearing, but he forced himself to go slowly, looking around for a trap. He saw nothing except the three rogues, though he sensed Shawna and others in the woods behind them. Moving carefully, forcing himself to be cautious, he found the mouth of the cave. He could see the flickering of a small fire inside, and he ducked his head in and approached softly.</p> <p>The cave was dim and smelled of damp earth and wood smoke. His sharp eyes immediately picked out a small blond man sitting by the fire, with his back to him. He was dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, his curly hair tucked behind his ears.</p><p>\u201cNicky?\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>When the man turned, Marco\u2019s heart leaped into his throat. Nicky welcomed him with a smile and outstretched arms, his beautiful blue eyes sparkling.</p><p>Crossing the distance between them in three long steps, he swept Nicky up into his arms and breathed in his wonderful, addictive scent. His Nicky at last. He covered his face with kisses, not giving him a chance to catch his breath. Finally, he sat down with him in his lap in the middle of the floor of the cave, not caring about anything but touching him all over and making sure he was all right.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay, darling. I\u2019m fine. You don\u2019t have to count all my fingers and toes,\u201d Nicky said, laughing, trying to stop Marco\u2019s questing hands from checking every inch of him.</p> <p>Marco held his face in his hands. \u201cLet me look at you. Are you all right, baby? Did they hurt you? God, I almost went crazy. Tara said she heard you calling my name. I thought I\u2019d go out of my mind.\u201d</p><p>Nicky looked ashamed and shook his head slowly. \u201cNo, sweetheart. No one hurt me at all. It was my idea to stay away so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What are you saying, Nicky? You wanted to stay away from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t want to stay away from you, but Shawna said I wouldn\u2019t become feral without your dominance, and I had to find out for myself.\u201d</p><p>A long tense silence ensued as Marco stared at Nicky uncomprehendingly. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>Marco placed Nicky on the floor of the cave beside him and stood up, looked down at him in disbelief. \u201cWere you in on this all along? Did you run away from me deliberately?\u201d</p> <p>Nicky stood up beside him, shaking his head firmly. \u201cNo, of course not. I didn\u2019t know them when they took me, but they were pretty decent to me\u2014explained to me what\u2019s going on with your pack and the rogues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey explained to you. Are you kidding me, Nicky? I don\u2019t understand. I was worried sick. I\u2019ve never been so upset, and it was all a trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Marco, I\u2019m trying to tell you something important if you\u2019ll just shut the hell up.\u201d</p><p>Marco\u2019s eyebrows rose almost to his hairline. He spoke quietly, his voice almost a whisper. \u201cDid you just tell me to shut the hell up? Me? Your master? Not to mention your Alpha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you! My Alpha, but I hope you\u2019re also my lover, and I\u2019d like you to be my friend, my equal. My mate, too, if you remember. I\u2019m not a slave, Marco, and I refuse to be treated like one any longer. The rogues told me I don\u2019t have to be. I stayed away from you deliberately for two weeks to see if I went feral. I hated to be away from you, but I had to see if what they were telling me was true. If only you\u2019ll listen to what they\u2019re telling you and stop being so damned stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you saying?\u201d Marco\u2019s voice had dropped low, rough, and cold.</p><p>\u201cYou told me that without constant domination I would become a monster. Well, here I am, Marco, two weeks with none of that, and I\u2019m fine. No feral behavior. No wildness. Just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long, Nicky? I can see you think you\u2019re fine, but it might not last. What if it doesn\u2019t? What will you do then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s my problem, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Marco\u2019s face became bright red. He looked like he might explode. \u201cOh, and you think it doesn\u2019t affect me too, Nicky? Your mate? You don\u2019t think I\u2019m involved in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing this for you, Marco. For us. I can\u2019t live the way you want me to. I just can\u2019t. It\u2019s not you\u2014I love you. It\u2019s the submission thing. I don\u2019t think I can do it all the time, Marco. I don\u2019t even mind it in bed so much\u2014I kind of like it, but not all the time. In the real world, you told me submissives are people who willingly give their obedience to someone they love and trust to care for them and give them what they need. I never chose to do that. It isn\u2019t me. Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t choose? Then what did you think you were doing the last night we were together? Oh, I see all right. You want my protection and you want me to take care of you, but you\u2019re such a brat, you want to do exactly as you see fit, even if it will put you in danger. Like walking to the bus stop late at night in a dangerous area. Like putting yourself in league with the rogues against the ones who love you the most. Like all the rest of your harebrained behavior. Smooth moves, Nicky. Very smooth. If you didn\u2019t act like a mentally-challenged child sometimes, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have to treat you like one.\u201d</p><p>Nicky\u2019s face blushed, but he took a deep breath and tried again. \u201cMarco, I know you\u2019re angry. The so-called rogues are trying to tell you we don\u2019t have to all be submissives anymore. That\u2019s all. I love that you feel protective of me and want to take care of me, but I\u2019m not a child, no matter what you say or a pet, and I can\u2019t be a trained dog. I can make my own decisions. Maybe they\u2019re not the greatest at times, but I should be able to do it anyway. I should be able to do that and still be your mate, still be a part of your pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re trying to tell me you\u2019re not happy with me as your master? Do you want a new mate? Is that what this is about? Is it Rory? You two have spent a lot of time together\u2014or maybe someone here? What did you do when I wasn\u2019t around, Nicky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, can you not understand what I\u2019m saying? It\u2019s because I love you so much that I\u2019m trying to help the rogues. I\u2019m trying to save our relationship. I\u2019m like Shawna\u2019s husband, honey. You told me I belonged to you, and I love that. I want that. But you also told me I\u2019d have to \u2018settle in\u2019, and I can\u2019t, Marco. Don\u2019t you see? I\u2019ll wind up resenting you for it eventually? Maybe even hating you.\u201d</p><p>Marco turned on his heel and walked out. His wolf was too close to the surface for him to stay another moment. Nicky chased him to the entrance and spun him around. Marco growled and balled up his fist as he turned.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you want to hit me? Go ahead, Marco. Beat me up. It\u2019s what you wolves most like to do, isn\u2019t it? Beat us up? Tie us? Drag us around on a leash?\u201d</p><p>Marco glared at him, saying nothing. He turned on his heel and stalked out, hearing yet ignoring Nicky calling him as he left the cave and kept going. Angry and hurt, he couldn\u2019t slow down, couldn\u2019t stop. The three rogues stood at the edge of the clearing, watching him storm away. Some part of him knew he would live to regret what he was doing, knew he couldn\u2019t live without Nicky, but he had to walk away, at least for now. He felt too betrayed, too hurt. As he stalked back to the compound, Shawna and her mate appeared before him on the trail. \u201cPlease stop, Alpha. We need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to say to you, Shawna,\u201d Marco growled. \u201cYou betrayed our pack and even managed to turn my mate against me. You must be very proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlpha, please listen. All we want to do is live within the compound again. We want to come back and be a part of the pack. We would follow your rules and respect you as our Alpha. But we have to be allowed to live freely, without making our mates submit if they don\u2019t want to. Our mates who don\u2019t submit are not dangerous to the pack or to anyone else. We have proof of that. To keep denying it is not the sign of a good Alpha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dare speak to me that way.\u201d Marco was aware of his face burning red with fury. Low growls emanated from his throat.</p><p>A quiet voice behind him made the blood race through his veins. \u201cStop being so stubborn! Listen to her, Marco. Please. You\u2019re wrong about this.\u201d</p><p>Marco whirled around to face Nicky on the trail behind him, looking miserable, yet incredibly lovely in the moonlight, his golden curls tipped with silver. Marco growled at him, his gaze shooting out his fury. How dare he\u2014his own mate\u2014say he was wrong about a pack decision? Before he could stop himself, he shifted and lunged, knocking Nicky to the ground, his teeth at his throat, ready to sink his fangs deep into the throbbing jugular. The sounds of the screaming rogues behind him swirled around him as a red haze covered his vision.</p><p>His snout was deep into Nicky\u2019s neck, and Nicky lay very still, his eyes tightly closed, his face turned away and his throat bared. Marco could hear his heart thumping wildly. Nicky\u2019s unique smell suddenly overcame Marco, and he faltered. \u201cMate,\u201d his brain screamed at him. He pulled his head back, still snarling yet whining nervously. Nicky opened his eyes, his beautiful eyes blankly registering shock. Jumping back in horror, Marco brushed past Shawna and her mate, racing down the trail, so furious and tormented he couldn\u2019t shift back to human shape.</p><p>Feeling horrified and shocked over almost killing his own mate, Marco tore down the trail and into the night, shame and heartbreak eating away at him like acid.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Trembling, Nicky sat up and watched the huge silver wolf race away. He was devastated. He didn\u2019t know for sure, but thought it must be pretty damn unusual for a wolf to attack his own mate. He\u2019d made Marco so angry, he was afraid he\u2019d never forgive him. He shuddered with reaction and fear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her face shocked and white, Shawna ran over to him and helped him up. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Nicky. I can\u2019t even imagine how you must be feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been better.\u201d Nicky tried to make a joke about it, but it hurt too much. A sob escaped his throat, and he dashed tears from his eyes. \u201cWhat can I do now, Shawna? He wanted to k-kill me. He was about to tear my head off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Nicky.\u201d She patted his arm. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know what he was doing. He shifted while he was still furious. He was totally out of control, and I know he\u2019s feeling horrified right now at what almost happened. The fact that he was able to stop himself proves how much he loves you. Marco will come to his senses. He has to! Just give him a couple of days.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you see his face? I did. He wanted to rip my throat out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Nicky, he loves you. You\u2019re his blood match and his mate. He won\u2019t be able to stay away from you. Wolves mate forever.\u201d</p><p>Nicky shook his head and turned to follow the rogues back to their camp, his feet dragging. He supposed he was a rogue now too. His own mate had rejected him, had almost killed him. He had hoped to be going back home with Marco tonight, to sleep in their bed together again, but Marco took what he\u2019d tried to do as betrayal and was so humiliated he had refused to try to understand Nicky\u2019s reasons for helping the rogues.</p><p>Now it was over. He\u2019d gambled and lost. Marco was right about his recklessness. It had almost taken his life once, and by taking this chance and losing Marco, he had truly destroyed himself.</p><p>* * * Marco paced up and down in his bedroom, more distraught than he\u2019d ever been in his life. Two days had passed since the terrible night on the trail. He kept thinking about what happened with Nicky. How could he have attacked his own mate? What if he hadn\u2019t caught his scent at the last second and been able to stop himself? It didn\u2019t bear thinking about. If he had injured Nicky or, God forbid, killed him...his throat closed up, and he was violently ill, only barely making it to the basin in time.</p> <p>He was rinsing his mouth when a knock came on his door. \u201cGo away!\u201d he shouted miserably.</p><p>The loud knocking only increased. \u201cOpen the door, Marco. Please, it\u2019s about the rogues.\u201d</p><p>Marco pulled the door open to find Rory standing in the hallway, looking pale and worried. \u201cThe rogues have come to talk to you. You won\u2019t believe what they have to say.\u201d</p><p>Marco frowned at Rory and then brushed past him and went downstairs to find Shawna and some of her pack members pacing nervously up and down in the common room. Nicky stood at the back of her assembled pack, keeping his head down and his gaze on the floor. Marco could pick up his thoughts, troubled and utterly sad. He wanted to rush to him and hold him, and he held himself back only with great effort.</p><p>He walked up to Shawna sternly, trying not to even glance again in Nicky\u2019s direction. His hands shoved in his pockets, angry and upset, he to hide it behind a mask of indifference.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, rogue?\u201d</p> <p>Shawna stepped up to him confidently. \u201cWe have a proposition for you, Alpha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d Marco fairly growled his answer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here again to ask you to allow the rogues to rejoin your pack. We hoped you\u2019d had time to reconsider. We would swear allegiance to you and follow all your orders. The only concession we would ask is that you allow our resistant males and females to live with us as your natural born pets do, without restraints and with more freedom.\u201d</p><p>Marco snorted. \u201cWhy would I do that? I owe you nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is our right. We share the same ancestry as you. This land was left to us as well as you. If you deny us, we\u2019ll declare a challenge to your pack.\u201d</p><p>The reaction from Marco\u2019s pack was immediate and angry. They crowded around him, upset and whining. Ian, his beta, stood frowning by his side. Marco laughed mirthlessly.</p><p>\u201cA challenge? You dare to come in my pack with such a stupid threat? We\u2019d annihilate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you probably would. We would take a few of your wolves with us, though. Innocent lives would be lost. Even our pets would challenge you, and your wolves would be forced to take their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Marco and his wolves growled at such an unthinkable idea. Pets were treasured by the pack. No wolf would ever knowingly hurt a pet, no matter whose pack they belonged to.</p><p>\u201cEven your own pet, Marco. You may not want him anymore, but would you want to see one of your wolves kill him?\u201d</p><p>Marco leaped at her. Only the efforts of three of his strongest pack members succeeded in holding him back from ripping out her throat. The idea of another wolf attacking his pet made him ill and sickened him. Ian and some of the older pack members worked for several minutes to calm him enough to stand in front of her again, his fists clenched and his jaw set in anger. Her own pack mewled restlessly around her.</p><p>Shawna continued, a little shaken, but standing firm. \u201cIt is our right to ask for one thing before we resort to an all-out challenge, Alpha. Our ancestral fathers decreed long ago if a member of the werekin pack thought their Alpha was wrong, a single member could issue a challenge against the Alpha. Would you be willing to accept a single challenge to decide the issue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo fight you? It would be slaughter, Shawna, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Shawna shook her head firmly. \u201cNo, not me. We do have another challenger. Another male. If you\u2019re not afraid of the challenge?\u201d</p><p>Marco growled menacingly, his eyes and face burning with a rage to tear someone\u2019s throat out. Bring it on, he screamed in his mind.</p><p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d He laughed bitterly and flexed his muscles. \u201cPresent your challenger, Shawna. I\u2019ll fight him in the ancestral ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will. Our challenger is here. If you lose the fight, or if you submit before the fight is over, you must accept our bid to join the pack.\u201d</p><p>Marco laughed shortly. \u201cI won\u2019t lose, and I sure as hell won\u2019t submit. Will he not show himself now? Is he afraid? I\u2019ll not show mercy in the ring, Shawna. No matter what. When a challenge is made to my authority, I won\u2019t back down.\u201d</p><p>Shawna nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s here. He\u2019ll show himself.\u201d She took a step backward. The wolves behind her also stepped to the side, making a kind of aisle. Standing at the end of the improvised aisle, looking very small next to the towering hulks of the wolves, was Nicky. His chin was raised high, though it trembled a little, and his eyes were feverishly bright. He stepped forward and came up closer to Marco, standing within an arm\u2019s reach.</p><p>His scent hit Marco like a heavy blow. Keeping himself from throwing Nicky down to the floor in front of everyone and fucking him until he begged for mercy was all Marco could do. He tore his gaze from Nicky and looked up at Shawna incredulously. \u201cWhat the hell is he doing here? What\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky is your challenger. He is werekin. It\u2019s our right.\u201d</p><p>A loud and violent outcry from the assembled wolves reverberated throughout the hall. A challenge from a mate and a pet was unheard of. Marco had eyes for no one but Nicky, and he watched as Nicky squared his shoulders against the chaos around him. He actually took a step closer to Marco, though, as if for protection. Marco\u2019s arms itched to reach out and hold him close to his body. When Marco spoke, his voice was soft and only intended for Nicky\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cYou want to fight me, Nicky? Are you issuing a challenge?\u201d</p><p>A hush fell over those closest by, as they strained to hear what Nicky might say. He was silent for a long moment before raising his eyes to Marco and taking a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight you, Marco. I want\u2014I want the ones you call the rogues to be allowed back into your pack. They have a right to be here, and they\u2014we\u2014have a right to live our lives the way we want to live them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter what your Alpha thinks?\u201d Marco\u2019s voice was soft, yet hard as stone.</p><p>\u201cA-a good Alpha wants what\u2019s best for his pack. You\u2019re a good Alpha, Marco, but, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re stubborn and set in your ways. Someone has to make you see what your people really need.\u201d</p><p>He laughed shortly. \u201cAnd you think that\u2019s you? You know what my kind wants?\u201d</p><p>Nicky bit his bottom lip. It took every ounce of self control Marco had not to take charge of that sweet lip and suck it into his mouth. He clenched his fists by his side to keep from dragging Nicky into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d Nicky said. \u201cMy hope is that in the long run, this might give us our chance to be together again.\u201d</p><p>Marco laughed shortly. \u201cBy fighting me in the ancestral ring? And if I hurt you or kill you? You don\u2019t stand a chance, and you know it. It would be a bloodbath.\u201d</p><p>Nicky bowed his head and remained quiet.</p><p>A new idea dawned on Marco\u2019s face. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe I\u2019d hurt you, do you? You think the fact that you\u2019re my mate would stop a fight from ever taking place, and then the rogues would win by default. So this is just a trick\u2014a clever ploy?\u201d He looked down at Nicky with disgust twisting his features. \u201cSo you\u2019re betraying me, Nicky, again?\u201d</p><p>Shawna broke in. \u201cDo you accept the challenge or not? If you do, meet us tomorrow in the forest at the ancestral ring, and we\u2019ll bring our champion before the final battle.\u201d</p><p>Marco gave Nicky an angry look. \u201cI accept.\u201d The wolves from his pack yipped loudly, pulling Marco away while Shawna and her rogues withdrew, leaving the compound, taking Nicky firmly by the arm and leading him away.</p><p>Marco stood in the common room surrounded by his pack, feeling stunned. Ian came close to him. \u201cWhat are you going to do? You can\u2019t fight your own mate, Marco. It would destroy you. Let me fight him.\u201d</p><p>Marco leaped at his beta and was restrained again by the other wolves. \u201cYou touch him\u2014 touch one hair of his head, any of you\u2014and I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d he snarled in fury.</p><p>Ian shook his head. \u201cYou talk like this, and yet you intend to face him in the ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle this. Stay out of it. Don\u2019t you think I know I can\u2019t hurt him?\u201d he growled. \u201cAt the same time I can\u2019t allow anyone else to come near him. Shawna knows it too. Maybe this is her plan all along\u2014to use my own mate against me to humiliate me and make me back down. Then she and her rogues can come in and take over.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marco cast a bitter, hopeless look at his beta. \u201cThey\u2019ve convinced my own mate to betray me. But it\u2019s my fault. I didn\u2019t spend enough time with him. It\u2019s time I took charge of my mate again. He\u2019s had too much freedom, and I haven\u2019t trained him properly. He thinks he\u2019ll be allowed to defy me. Well, he\u2019s got another think coming. I\u2019ll teach him a lesson he\u2019ll never forget.\u201d</p><p>* * * Nicky was jittery. No matter how many times Shawna reassured him Marco would never hurt him, he still remembered the hot breath of the wolf on his throat, the fangs dripping saliva on his neck. Nicky knew better. He\u2019d seen the bitter, hate-filled look in Marco\u2019s eyes when he left him in the cave. Hell, the very fact he\u2019d left him behind argued for a complete break. Nicky knew enough about Marco to believe he would never leave his mate behind in what he considered an enemy camp. It must mean Marco no longer considered him to be his mate. The thought made him sick. He shuddered, wondering if Marco would tear him limb from limb or be content with just ripping out his throat.</p><p>Not that it mattered a great deal. If Marco was truly through with him, and no matter what Shawna said, Nicky believed he was, the truth was his life would be over anyway. Where would he go? What would he do? He supposed he could crawl back to Atlanta and get his old job back. That is, if his old boss, with whom he was never exactly a favorite, didn\u2019t rip his head off for quitting without notice and disappearing. Even if he could get another job waiting tables, the need for an occasional pint of werewolf blood might tend to complicate things.</p> <p>Shawna told him he could stay with the rogues and feed from their wolves. She\u2019d been urging him to feed from her or someone else for some time now, but he\u2019d refused. The idea of feeding from anyone but Marco disgusted him. Besides, he wanted to see how long he could go without it. If he could do without the blood indefinitely, he would increase his chances of being free from the pack again. If he had to leave, maybe he could somehow survive. He certainly couldn\u2019t stay and watch Marco go on with his life without him.</p><p>Shawna even promised he wouldn\u2019t have a problem finding a new mate if the bid for rejoining the Mountain pack failed. She would hook him up with someone else from her pack if Marco no longer wanted him. Trouble was he found the idea repellent. He had no interest now in any other mate, male or female. His blood sang only for Marco.</p><p>No, if this challenge didn\u2019t work, he didn\u2019t know what would happen. If they did join Marco\u2019s pack, he wouldn\u2019t be able to stand the sight of Marco with another mate. It would kill him for sure. He began to think about taking his own life. He should have died anyway, when those muggers cut his throat. He\u2019d cheated death then, and maybe death was trying to collect its debt.</p><p>Two of the younger members of Shawna\u2019s pack came to tell him it was time to go to the ancestral ring for the challenge, and Nicky stood up. He was ready. To live this way had become intolerable. He was ready to get it over with one way or another. He took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and followed the wolves to meet the rest of the pack.</p><p>The ancestral ring, a ring of stones carefully laid in a circle with grass well trampled within, lay about a mile from their camp. Nicky walked quietly toward the arena, his mind full of what was to come. Shawna walked beside him and her mate flanked him. He wondered if they thought he might try to make a break for it. He might have considered it, to avoid having to see Marco again, but he had nowhere else to go.</p> <p>As they drew closer to the ring, Nicky could see Marco, standing menacingly just outside the circle, his big form totally obscuring everyone else for him. Nicky could already smell his distinctive scent, and he yearned for it. He tried to take shallow breaths and keep his mind blank, knowing Marco could read his mind if he still wanted to. He\u2019d decided to fight. He really had no choice. He fervently hoped Marco would kill him quickly.</p><p>* * * Marco stepped inside the ring, stalking slowly and deliberately toward his mate. Nicky walked slowly out to the center to meet him. His beautifully sculpted body looked like a Greek statue, lean, muscular and perfect. His shining, golden hair lit up the center of the circle. Marco walked slowly around him, prowling in a tight circle, never stopping, to make it harder for Nicky to follow him without getting dizzy. Nicky stood, not moving, as Marco stalked him, getting closer and closer with every turn until he stood right in front of him. He towered over the smaller man. Leaning down, he whispered angrily in his ear, making Nicky shiver from the contact.</p><p>\u201cWell, Nicky, we both know who the Dominant one is here. Why don\u2019t you fight me? Bite me. Kick me. Do something.\u201d Putting out a hand he pushed Nicky provokingly on his chest. \u201cC\u2019mon. What are you going to do? Make a move, baby.\u201d</p><p>Nicky raised his eyes, bright with tears, and looked directly at Marco. His chin quivered, and he hunched his shoulders. He put out one hand blindly to Marco, but Marco slapped it away in contempt. Marco felt Nicky\u2019s pain at the gesture deep in his soul, and his pack, sensing it, made whimpering noises deep in their throats. He had to make Nicky think he hated him for making this challenge. He had to make him believe he was deeply disappointed in him, the only way to bring him around, to make him beg his forgiveness and submit.</p><p>Marco picked up on Nicky\u2019s thoughts\u2014pure desperation and misery. He knew he was close to the breaking point. He only needed to keep up the pressure. He had no intention of hurting Nicky, but he had to make him give in. Unless he did, they had no chance. Marco couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t hurt him, yet if he had to submit to Nicky, it would not only destroy the pack\u2019s confidence in him as a leader, but it would make him resent Nicky. Maybe even hate him at the same time he loved him. The split in his psyche would tear him apart. Even now, just by having his mate in the ring with him, he was terribly torn and upset, not thinking straight.</p><p>He pushed him again, and Nicky fell down. He scrambled back to his feet, though, and tried to follow Marco with his eyes. Marco circled him so quickly, Nicky spun, apparently only succeeding in making himself dizzy. He stumbled a little and shook his head as if to clear it.</p> <p>Nicky took a deep breath, and Marco heard his thoughts as plain as if he\u2019d spoken . It\u2019s now or never. I hope it\u2019s over quickly.</p><p>He lunged at Marco as he came around and fell sprawling as Marco neatly stepped out of the way. Nicky got to his feet again and dove toward Marco. Marco caught him and put him on the ground, careful not to hurt him much, though he still heard Nicky\u2019s cry of pain in his head, and it rattled him. Marco put a hand on his throat, holding him down.</p><p>\u201cGive up! You\u2019re going to hurt yourself, damn it!\u201d</p><p>Doggedly, Nicky shook his head, panting from exertion. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Marco snarled at him. \u201cDo you really think so little of me, Nicky? Did you ever love me, or was it all pretense?\u201d</p><p>Nicky shook his head frantically. \u201cWhat do you mean? You know that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you defy me? Why do you try to humiliate me in front of my pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShawna is using you. She thinks I won\u2019t be able to hurt you, and I\u2019ll have to give in. Then my pack will think me weak and want a new Alpha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want to hurt your reputation, Marco. I would never do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen submit. Now. Clearly and without leaving any doubt.\u201d He released his hold on Nicky\u2019s throat and stood up, looked down at him and waited. This was the moment that would shape the rest of their lives together. If Nicky refused to submit, Marco would have to fall to his knees in front of him. If that happened, it would destroy something deep in Marco\u2019s soul.</p><p>Nicky rose to his feet, his legs shaky. He looked from Shawna and her pack back to Marco. Sighing in defeat, he sank down on his knees in front of Marco, presenting his neck. It was an instinctive sign of abject submission and humility. Nicky\u2019s back was straight, his hands were behind his back, and he trembled. By sinking to his knees and giving up, Marco won the challenge by default. He could now rip out his opponent\u2019s throat if he wished to.</p><p>A gasp came from the crowd when Nicky fell to his knees, but now it seemed the entire pack held its breath to see what would happen next.</p><p>Marco leaned over, putting his hands on Nicky\u2019s shoulders, holding him in place. He brought his mouth down close to his throat to let him feel his hot breath on his neck. He could feel Nicky\u2019s whole body jerking with fear. Marco slowly straightened and turned his back on Nicky, speaking to the wolves assembled in the ring.</p><p>\u201cThe challenge is over. The rogues\u2019 challenger has shown his submission. Your challenge failed. Take your pack, Shawna, and get out.\u201d</p><p>Dead silence filled the area around the ring for a long moment, and then Marco\u2019s pack burst into excited yips and howls. The rogues watched them moodily and filed slowly out of the clearing. The wolves of Marco\u2019s pack surrounded him, thumping him on the back, the younger wolves punching and shoving each other good naturedly.</p><p>Ian slapped his Alpha on the back. \u201cYou handled that perfectly, Marco. What did you say to make him submit to you? Where is Nicky anyway? Did he leave?\u201d</p><p>Puzzled, Marco turned, his eyes searching the clearing. Nicky was nowhere to be seen. He had vanished, apparently leaving when the rogues left. Fear clenched at Marco. He took an involuntary step forward. Had Nicky left him again? Didn\u2019t he want to be with him? He must have submitted only because he felt some loyalty still and hadn\u2019t wanted to take away Marco\u2019s rank as Alpha. Marco\u2019s heart clenched and turned icy. Nicky had no interest in staying as Marco\u2019s submissive mate. He\u2019d made that abundantly clear. How many times did he have to say it before Marco\u2019s stubborn heart understood?</p><p>Turning to Ian, he shrugged with bravado. \u201cWho knows? Who cares? Let him go with the other rogues. I tried to make it work with him, but he\u2019s impossible. I\u2019m tired of him and his antics.\u201d</p><p>Still Marco reached out with his mind to find Nicky. He could catch the faintest echo of him close by, and his heart slowed a little. Despite his words, he worried. If Nicky didn\u2019t want him, he wasn\u2019t sure what he would do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere is your mate, Alpha?\u201d</p><p>Marco whirled around to see Shawna standing in front of him. He glared down at her. \u201cI thought you\u2019d have enough sense to follow your wolves and get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel responsible for Nicky. He tried to help us, and he had no idea you would think of what he did as a betrayal. He\u2019s a good person, Marco, and he truly loves you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd why would you think I\u2019d be interested in that information?\u201d</p><p>Shawna\u2019s eyes flashed furiously at him. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool, Alpha!\u201d</p><p>Marco\u2019s pack members bristled at the insult to their Alpha and growled angrily, stepping closer behind Marco. Likewise, a few of Shawna\u2019s pack members guarding her gathered closer, growling back, some baring their teeth.</p><p>Shawna put up a hand to stop all the posturing. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not interested in him as a mate anymore, you have a responsibility to him as a member of this pack. Your wolves brought him here. Against his will, I might add. You took his life away from him, and you at least owe him another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dead or hurt, Shawna. I could sense it if he was, and I still feel him close by. Besides, he doesn\u2019t have any interest in being here with me or this pack. Let him leave here if that\u2019s what he wants.\u201d He tried to make his voice indifferent. His pride wanted no one to know he\u2019d never let Nicky leave him.</p> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t go home, Marco, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You keep telling us you have proof that he won\u2019t turn feral. If your theory is correct, there should be no reason he can\u2019t go home.\u201d</p><p>Shawna shook her head stubbornly. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking straight. He\u2019s been changed, Marco. He has to be in a pack. He still has to feed from one of us from time to time, and you know it. He\u2019s refused all feedings I\u2019ve offered him. I\u2019ve even offered to find him another mate.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Nicky with another mate, feeding from him, making love to him filled Marco with outrage and fury. Nicky was his. Only his. He would take great pleasure in killing anyone who came between them.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s on his own, I don\u2019t know what could happen to him. He hasn\u2019t fed in over two weeks. Our mates have never gone so long. I tried to talk him out of it, but he was insistent. He wanted to see if he was really changed. He\u2019s very stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it,\u201d Marco said, rolling his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cEven if you can still sense him alive, he may not stay that way long. There may be Hunters in the woods. And he has to feed soon and from you, Marco. He won\u2019t accept anyone else. He was almost destroyed by what happened between you. If you ever cared for him at all, help me find him before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Marco had become more and more uneasy as she spoke and panic washed over him. Turning to his beta, Ian, he gave him a significant look. \u201cWe have to find him, Ian. She\u2019s right. He\u2019s so... he does things without thinking. I could sense he was terribly upset during the challenge. Maybe I pushed him too far. We have to find him.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded with concern, and the entire pack moved, mobilizing for the search. Marco turned back to Shawna, his voice still gruff, but with a hint of apology. \u201cThank you for letting me know. We\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, Alpha, we\u2019ll help too. He brought all this on himself trying to help us. We made it worse when we urged him to be our champion. We knew he didn\u2019t know what it would mean, and we took advantage of him.\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded curtly, her words cutting into him like a knife. He brought all this on himself. She meant Marco\u2019s wrath, partly caused by his own failure with his mate. He knew that now. He\u2019d let his temper get the best of him with Nicky, not just because he\u2019d sided with the rogues, but because Marco had failed to satisfy him. He\u2019d failed to make him feel a part of his life. He\u2019d neglected his mate, and at the end, he\u2019d almost killed him. A sudden image of his teeth sinking into Nicky\u2019s sweet throat made him ill again, and he barely kept the bile from bursting from his mouth.</p><p>From nearby, an unearthly, feral howl split the air, making everyone freeze in panic and fear. Marco was stricken with horror, knowing it came from Nicky. He turned, shifting as he ran, desperate to get to him.</p><p>* * * Nicky stood outside the circle, standing behind a grove of laurels, growing as twisted and crooked as his love for Marco had become. He listened to the words Marco said to Ian with disbelief and heartbreak. \u201cWho cares? I\u2019m tired of him.\u201d</p><p>Each word hit him like a physical blow. Exactly as he\u2019d feared, Marco hated him. Obvious now, and it had probably been obvious all along, but Nicky hadn\u2019t wanted to see it. Marco made a mistake. There was no blood match with him. Nicky was a mistake, an error. He put a shaking hand to his face. A terrible pain pierced his chest. Could he actually be feeling his heart breaking? He stumbled down the path, running away from the pain.</p> <p>He was terrified, the pain emanating from his very soul, forcing its way out of him. He stumbled out into the forest, something inside him clawing to burst free. He fell on the ground, writhing in agony. A growl tore itself past his lips, a terrible sound that frightened him and filled him with unreasoning rage. He opened his mouth and a wolf-like howl issued forth, inhuman, feral, and brutish. He got up on his knees and threw back his head to let the bestial sound out freely, easing the pain a little. The howl reverberated through the trees, and startled yells came from the group still standing some fifty yards away by the ancestral ring. He jumped to his feet, aware they were coming toward him, excited yipping and growling issuing from the group as he howled out his challenge.</p><p>He tore off his clothing, which was suddenly too tight and choking him. His body was changing, morphing into something not quite human, something savage. The pack surrounded him, sniffing at him, stalking him, and in front paced a big silver wolf with beautiful, flashing eyes. Nicky wanted to kill him, to rip his heart out as he\u2019d ripped out Nicky\u2019s. Nicky stood with his feet planted wide apart, his chest heaving and his hands clenched into fists. The big wolf morphed into Marco again. Marco, the only man he\u2019d ever loved, the only man he hated. He growled at him again, a low, guttural sound. Marco stared at him in horror.</p><p>\u201cNicky?\u201d he whispered. \u201cNicky, is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you care?\u201d Nicky didn\u2019t even recognize the sound issuing from his throat. His voice was deeper, fierce and harsh. \u201cYou said I\u2019m impossible, remember? You\u2019re through with me. So fuck you!\u201d</p><p>The other wolves gathered close to their Alpha. Some had already shifted back to human form, and they all stared at Nicky in fascination and disbelief. He could see Rory at the back, his face blank with horror. Ian, Marco\u2019s beta, stepped up beside Marco and grabbed his arm when he would have stepped forward. Marco shook him off impatiently. He kept his voice low and calm as he spoke to Nicky.</p><p>\u201cNicky, it\u2019s Marco. Do you recognize me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I recognize you. You\u2019re the bastard who\u2019s been torturing me for the last few weeks. Well, I\u2019m through, do you understand? I never want to see you again. I don\u2019t need anybody! I don\u2019t need you!\u201d Another howl escaped his lips as a terrible pain racked his body, and he fell back to his knees. His body shuddered, and the snarling tore at him. Still on his knees, the pain ripping him apart, he put back his head and another ferocious, inhuman howl tore from his chest.</p><p>Marco rushed him, putting him down on the ground with his knee in his back, pulling his arms behind him. He struggled fiercely, trying to dislodge him. Marco was much too strong. Another terrible pain racked Nicky\u2019s body, settling in his spine. He howled again in agony. A blow struck the back of his head. His body sagged, no longer struggling, and he thought he might be dying. Sinking into oblivion, he was fleetingly sorry the last words he ever said to Marco were so harsh. He wished he might call them back, and then the darkness fell down on him like an avalanche.</p><p>* * * Nicky ran through a forest, wind in his hair. He came to a lake and jumped in, the cool water closing over his head comfortingly. He could hear someone calling him, as if from the shore, and he struggled to the surface, wanting to answer, wanting to obey. He felt the familiar touch on his lips, and the back of his head. Someone urged him to feed from their wrist. He closed his eyes and let the bright sweetness pass over his lips, the sucking motion of his lips soothing him, quieting his need to struggle to the surface.</p><p>Nicky woke up slowly, trying to stretch his arms over his head. Something held them down. He had a horrible headache and winced at the light streaming in the window, keeping his eyes tightly shut.</p><p>\u201cNicky? Are you awake?\u201d He opened his eyes to see Marco sitting beside him on a chair by the bed. It wasn\u2019t his and Marco\u2019s bed though, and for a moment he couldn\u2019t understand what was happening. He was lying in some kind of hospital bed, his arms strapped down to the bed rails. He pulled at the straps, panicking and breathing hard.</p><p>Marco jumped and bent over him, putting his hands on his shoulders. \u201cStop, baby, you\u2019ll hurt yourself.\u201d \u201cWhat? What\u2019s happening? Why do you have me strapped down?\u201d He looked around himself wildly. He was in a room he didn\u2019t recognize, stark with plain white walls and one uncurtained window high up on one wall. \u201cWhere am I, Marco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, calm down. Nothing bad is happening to you. I\u2019m here with you, and I won\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where am I?\u201d Nicky pulled against the straps and thrashed his head on the pillows. \u201cLet me up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky, you have to calm down. Listen to me. You\u2019ve been ill, but I\u2019m taking care of you. You\u2019re going to be fine, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>Somewhat soothed by his quiet voice, Nicky subsided a little, looking up at Marco. \u201cBut I don\u2019t understand. Oh my God, is this the basement cell? Did you put me here because of the challenge? I\u2019m sorry, Marco. I\u2019m so sorry! Let me go, and I\u2019ll leave. I promise. You know I can\u2019t stand being locked away. Please. I\u2019m begging!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marco bit his lip a moment and then hurried to release Nicky\u2019s arms. He put down the side of the bed and climbed into the narrow space, lying beside him and held him close. Wrapping his arms around Nicky, he kissed his lips. \u201cBe quiet, baby. Let me explain what I think has happened. Don\u2019t be frightened, because I\u2019m handling it, okay? Now are you ready to listen?\u201d</p><p>Nicky nodded, snuggling up into Marco. Marco\u2019s wonderful smell washed over him, and even though he knew Marco didn\u2019t love him anymore, he reveled in his closeness.</p><p>\u201cAfter the challenge, we heard a howling. We rushed over and found you\u2014changed.\u201d</p> <p>The way his voice tightened at the last word alarmed Nicky. \u201cChanged? What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of our pack has ever seen it before; we\u2019ve only read about it in old books passed down through the pack. But we think\u2014we think you went feral, Nicky.\u201d</p><p>Nicky jumped. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went without feeding for a long time, too long. We\u2019d only changed you a short time ago, and your body couldn\u2019t withstand the deprivation. You needed my blood.\u201d Marco kissed the back of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I should have fed you the minute I saw you in the cave. Instead, I lost my temper and left you behind. I\u2019m so sorry, Nicky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-but how do you know? What did I do? I just remember getting really angry after I heard what you said to Ian, and I remember yelling at you. You knocked me down, didn\u2019t you? That\u2019s the last thing I remember.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen we heard you howling, we ran over to where you were standing and you were changed.\u201d</p><p>His voice did the same thing when he uttered the word, sounding horrified. \u201cThat\u2019s the second time you said that. How exactly was I changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were bigger, more muscular. Sort of beast-like. Your face was a little like a wolf\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, I knew you\u2019d freak out. It\u2019s okay. You started responding right away to my feedings, and you\u2019re almost completely back to normal now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost?\u201d Nicky\u2019s voice cracked, a couple of octaves higher than normal. He tried to pull away but Marco held him tight. Nicky sighed heavily. \u201cRight. That\u2019s why I woke up strapped to a bed in the basement cell, and why you won\u2019t let go of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust a precaution, Nicky, until we\u2019re sure you\u2019re absolutely back to normal. You had to feed from Rory\u2019s blood too, and we didn\u2019t know if it would work as well as mine. You look like your beautiful self again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory\u2019s blood? But why? Didn\u2019t-didn\u2019t you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, baby, and I\u2019ve been feeding you. But I couldn\u2019t give you enough without getting sick myself. We\u2019re in uncharted waters here. We didn\u2019t know exactly what to do, so we\u2019ve been feeding you every few hours. You\u2019re the first pet to go completely feral in over a hundred years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about Shawna\u2019s mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter seeing you, we know now he was just angry and defiant. He was nothing like you. Your body even tried to shape shift.\u201d</p><p>Nicky groaned. \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m such a fuck-up. I should have listened to you when you told me. Now I\u2019ve ruined everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t ruined anything. You\u2019ll be back to normal in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what happens? Will Rory be able to keep feeding me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRory? No, I\u2019ll be able to handle it alone.\u201d</p><p>After a long silence, Nicky sighed again. \u201cI heard what you said to Ian about not caring about me anymore. It\u2019s okay, Marco. I don\u2019t want to be a millstone around your neck. You made a mistake in picking me for your mate, and you deserve someone better. I\u2019m releasing you from your vows. You don\u2019t have to do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t, do I? You\u2019re releasing me? Well, I\u2019m not releasing you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco, please. After what happened, I know you don\u2019t want me back in the compound. I know how you feel about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know you don\u2019t love me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Marco, why do you keep asking me questions like that? And why are you looking at me that way? I don\u2019t want to be a burden to you anymore. I know I\u2019m a disappointment and an embarrassment. I just couldn\u2019t settle in like you wanted. I\u2019m a bad mate, Marco. I embarrassed you. I\u2019m not the person you need, and I\u2019m so sorry I challenged you.\u201d</p><p>Marco continued to stare at him. \u201cYou know, perhaps I\u2019ve been coddling you too much the past few days, letting you lie here in bed, when what you really needed is some good old fashioned discipline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiscipline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Nicky. I think I need to give you the spanking you\u2019ve been asking for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nicky licked his lips nervously. \u201cBut I told you, I\u2019m not into all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I am, and you\u2019re getting a spanking, sweetheart, and probably on a regular basis from now on, and that\u2019s not a threat, that\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-a regular basis? From now on? Does that mean you still want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you when I first fucked you that you belonged to me. Did I stutter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush! You don\u2019t have permission to speak.\u201d He turned him loose. \u201cTake your pajama pants off. Now.\u201d</p><p>Nicky\u2019s nerve broke, and he tried desperately to break Marco\u2019s hold and get out of bed. Failing miserably, he was helpless as Marco sat up and pulled his body up to his own.</p><p>\u201cI said, get your pajamas off.\u201d</p><p>Trembling, Nicky did as he was told, scooting out of them while Marco watched him with brooding intensity and growing excitement. Finally he sat in front of Marco, naked and shivering. \u201cPlease, Marco. Tell me what you plan to do with me. I\u2019ll do anything you say. Just don\u2019t make me go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not listening, boy. You\u2019re not going anywhere. You belong to me. You\u2019ll always belong to me. I\u2019ve been angry with you, yes, and said some things I never meant. I\u2019ve been punishing you. And punishing myself right along with you. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. I love you very much. I\u2019m sorry for scaring you like I did when I shifted on the trail. I\u2019m sorry you overheard things that hurt you. I was trying to show off in front of my beta, but I promise I\u2019ll never do that again. I\u2019d rather die myself than hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God,\u201d Nicky said fervently. \u201cCan I come back home then? I\u2019ll try to be submissive if you want me to. I\u2019ll try to be whatever you want me to be. I promise I\u2019ll do everything you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re coming home all right. And you\u2019ll submit to me in the bedroom. You\u2019ll also do what I tell you to do, because you\u2019re way too reckless and headstrong. I will be your protector and your guide, whether you want me to or not. You\u2019re far too important to me to risk. You\u2019ll obey me or suffer the consequences. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Nicky\u2019s head bobbed up and down.</p><p>\u201cHowever, I agree I\u2019ve been a little too protective. You\u2019ll still wear my collar to show who you belong to, but the leash is not necessary. I\u2019ll give you more freedom if that will make you happy. You can start up your painting again. That should keep you occupied and out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, Marco. Thank you, darling. Can we go back home now? I don\u2019t like it in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight after I remind you whom you belong to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>Marco took him by the arm and held onto him as he settled himself on the side of the bed. He pulled Nicky belly down over his lap.</p><p>\u201cNo, Marco, please!\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, he lifted Nicky up a bit and took a firm hold of Nicky\u2019s rigid cock, tucked it down between his own legs and tightened his thighs. With one large hand in the small of Nicky\u2019s back, he held him down firmly. \u201cYour safe word is candy. Use it if this gets too intense and we\u2019ll stop for a while. Everything will start up again later though, so don\u2019t use it unless you have to. You\u2019re mine, Nicky, and though we may decide not to live this lifestyle all the time as you said, we will live it in our most intimate time together. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d A hard slap came down on his backside, making him jump in pain. \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was for even thinking I don\u2019t want you anymore. You are never, under any circumstances to ever think that again. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Marco\u2019s hand came down hard again with a loud popping sound. \u201cThat was for taking anyone\u2019s side against me, your mate. Now tell me how sorry you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! Marco, please,\u201d Nicky cried loudly, trying desperately to get away from Marco\u2019s unrelenting grip. His cock, still tucked firmly between Marco\u2019s legs and hard as a rock, rubbed against Marco\u2019s thighs, driving him crazy.</p><p>Another slap came down hard. \u201cThat was for cussing me. Say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d \u201cCandy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky? Do you need to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I just wanted to make sure you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to say you\u2019re sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He spanked him again. \u201cThat was for staying away and not coming to ask me to forgive you. I think you know what to say.\u201d</p><p>Nicky began to sob. \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><p>Marco brought his hand down one more time. \u201cAnd that is for even thinking of leaving me. Say it!\u201d</p><p>Nicky was sobbing loudly and squirming in earnest. Marco waited patiently for him to gulp out his last apology. Then he turned him upright and sat him down hard on his lap, enjoying his winces of pain as his hard lap met Nicky\u2019s abused and tender ass. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to fuck you, Nicky. And the way I\u2019m feeling right now, I\u2019m afraid my knot may come out to play. We may be here a long while.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, Marco, not that! Please!\u201d Nicky pleaded while the very thought of that knot teasing his prostrate made his insides clench with want.</p><p>\u201cNothing I can do about it, baby. It\u2019s all up to the wolf now. And the wolf is thinking you need a very good fucking and a few orgasms to let you see what you\u2019ve been missing.\u201d</p><p>Marco put him back on the bed and stood up, removing his clothes. Nicky sat up suddenly and threw his arms around Marco\u2019s neck and kissed him full on the lips. Surprised yet pleased, Marco looked down at him with a wolfish grin. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to stop me, baby. I\u2019m going to make love to you for a very long time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always did talk too much.\u201d Nicky\u2019s fingertip stroked the wolf knot encircling Marco\u2019s cock. \u201cYou know, actions speak louder than words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for special occasions, and this is very special.\u201d His words served a double meaning as he enclosed Nicky\u2019s hard cock with his fingers and smiled wolfishly, showing his large incisors.</p><p>Nicky gasped. \u201cMarco, your teeth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm...All the better to...oh hell, you know the rest.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p> <p>The meeting with his council had been the most contentious meeting in the history of the pack. Bowing to pressure from the families of the rogues and in response to passionate and articulate pleas from both Shawna and her mate, the council decided to allow the rogue pack to rejoin the Mountain Wolf pack on a trial basis. Many of the older wolves had walked out in protest, a huge challenge to Marco\u2019s leadership as Alpha, but he had made the final decision for the good of the pack as a whole, as a good Alpha should. They would adopt a wait-and-see attitude and allow the rogues to move back in the compound and live their lives the way they chose to as long as the pets continued to feed from their mates.</p><p>Marco walked outside to the gardens and found Nicky by his easel, painting a group of laurel trees tangled together alongside the path. He turned when he sensed Marco close by and put down his brush to run to him.</p><p>\u201cIs the meeting over?\u201d \u201cYes, baby,\u201d Marco said, catching him in his arms. \u201cThe rogues are moving back in tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShawna and the others must be so pleased. Thank you, darling, for being willing to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a very reasonable man.\u201d</p><p>Nicky made a choking sound of laughter, though he tried hard to keep it in.</p> <p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t agree, huh?\u201d He began to tickle Nicky\u2019s sides as he convulsed in laughter and tried to get away. They wound up falling down in the grass, Marco turning his body so he took the brunt of the fall. He turned Nicky over on his back and held his hands helpless above his head as he kissed him thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cI think I should take you up to our room to show you what happens to bad boys who laugh at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm...promises, promises,\u201d Nicky said, laughing. \u201cI think I\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>Marco brushed his lips over Nicky\u2019s again. \u201cGood boy.\u201d</p><p>*THE END* </p> </body></html>"]
