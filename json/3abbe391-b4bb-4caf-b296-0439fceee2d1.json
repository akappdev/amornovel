Snow was spitting down on him with malice he could almost feel. It did nothing for his mood. He disliked leaving his home for any reason, but being called toAmerica to pay homage to The Wonderful Child was a bit much.</p><p>And now he was shamed; his duty had never seemed a chore before. He admired and respected the pack leaders, Michael and Jeannie Wyndham. Michael was a good man and a fine leader; his wife was a crack shot cutie and baby Lara was adorable. Since the cooing, drooling infant was likely to be his next pack leader, Alec\u2019s presence\u2014the presence of every country\u2019s werewolf head\u2014had been required for both political and practical reasons. The pack was some 300,000 werewolves strong; unity was both a desire and a necessity.</p> <p>Unfortunately, visiting the Wyndhams in their happy home just exacerbated his own loneliness. He\u2019d been searching for a mate for years, but had...how did the humans put it? Never found the right girl. He thought it was funny that human women complained their men didn\u2019t commit. An unattached werewolf male was likely to want to move in after the first date. What was a man, after all, without a mate, without cubs?</p><p>Nothing, that\u2019s what. Meeting baby Lara was a great relief; pack leaders without heirs made everyone nervous. Seeing Michael\u2019s happiness, on the other hand, was a torture.</p><p>Now his duty was done, and thank God. His plane leftBoston tonight, and nothing was keeping him from it.</p><p>Faugh! More snow! And not likely to be much better, even when he got home. Really, there was nothing to look forward to until spring. Others of his kind might enjoy romping through the slush on all fours, but here was one furry laird who hated getting his feet wet.</p><p>AndBoston ! Grey, drizzly, drearyBoston , which smelled like damp wool and exhaust. He felt like pulling his scarf over his nose to muffle the smells of</p> <p>(peaches, ripe peaches)</p><p>unwashed masses and</p><p>(peaches)</p><p>He stopped suddenly, and felt a one-two punch as the couple walking behind him slammed into his back. He barely felt it. Hardly heard their complaints. He spun, pushed past them. Walked back, nostrils flaring, trying to catch that elusive</p><p>jangleJANGLEjangleJANGLEjangle</p><p>intoxicating</p> <p>jangleJANGLEjangleJANGLEjangle</p><p>utterly wonderful scent.</p><p>He stiffened, not unlike a dog on point. There. The street corner. Red suit trimmed with white. White gloved hand shaking that annoying bell. Belly shaking like a bowlful of jelly. The glorious smell was coming from Santa Claus.</p><p>jangleJANGLEjangleJANGLEjangle</p><p>He charged across the street without looking, ignoring the blaring horns, the shriek of airbrakes. The closer he got, the better Santa smelled.</p><p>JangleJANGLEjan\u2014</p><p>\u201cJeez, there\u2019s no rush,\u201d Santa said in a startled contralto, pulling down her beard to squint up at him. Her eyes were the color of Godiva milk chocolate. Her cheeks were blooded, kissed by the wind. Her nose was snub. Adorable. He felt like kissing it. \u201cI mean, the bucket and I aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh,\u201d he said, or something like it.</p> <p>\u201cYou really should forget that whole \u2018pedestrians have the right of way\u2019 attitude when you\u2019re in this town...errr...everything okay?\u201d</p><p>He had been looming over her, drinking her in. Now he jerked back. \u201cFine, everything\u2019s fine. Have dinner with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ten o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d She blinked up at him. A stray snowflake spiraled down, landed on her nose. Melted.</p><p>\u201cThen lunch.\u201d</p><p>The woman looked down at herself, as if making sure that, yes, she was dressed in the least flattering outfit a woman could wear. \u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d she asked at last.</p><p>\u201cNever better.\u201d It was the truth. This was rapidly turning into the best day ever. He had visions of spending the rest of the day rolling around on Egyptian cotton sheets with Santa. \u201cLunch.\u201d</p><p>She peered at him with adorable suspicion. \u201cIs that a question? Is this your first day out of the institution?\u201d</p><p>Right, right, she was human. Be polite. \u201cLunch. Please. Now.\u201d</p><p>She burst out laughing, putting a hand on her large belly to keep from falling into the street. As if he\u2019d let that happen. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she gasped, \u201cbut the absurdity of this...you...and...it just hit me all at once.\u201d She cut her gaze away from his to smile at the woman who had just tucked a dollar into her bucket. \u201cMerry Christmas, ma\u2019am, and thank you.\u201d</p><p>Now that he was no longer gazing into her eyes, he felt much colder and realized his feet were wet. Faugh!</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have lunch now,\u201d she said kindly, looking back at him. \u201cI can\u2019t leave my spot until noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even if you made lots of money before then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even if thereal Santa came along to relieve me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoon, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. All right.\u201d She smiled up at him with timid liking. \u201cYou\u2019ll be sorry. Wait until you see me out of this Santa outfit.\u201d The spasm of lust nearly toppled him into the gutter. \u201cI\u2019m not at all cute,\u201d she finished with charming idiocy.</p><p>\u201cNoon,\u201d he said again, then pulled his roll from his coat pocket. He plucked the money clip off the wad, and dropped the eight thousand dollars or so into her bucket. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that was Monopoly money,\u201d she hollered after him, \u201clunch isoff !\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Giselle Smith watched the visitor from the planet Hunk stride away. When he\u2019d rushed up to her, she had nearly dropped her bell. There she was, jangling for charity, and then Hunk Man wasright there . She couldn\u2019t believe the speed at which he\u2019d moved.</p><p>His hair was a deep, true auburn. His eyes were a funny kind of brown, so light they were nearly gold. His nose was a blade and his mouth\u2014oooh, his mouth! A girl could stare at it and think...oh, all sorts of things. He was tall, too; she had to crane her neck to look at him. Over six feet, for sure. Shoulders like a swimmer. Knee-length black wool coat, probably worth a grand at least. Black gloves covering big hands; the guy looked like he could palm a basketball, no problem.</p><p>He had come charging across the street to, of all things, ask her to lunch. And to give her thousands\u2014thousands!\u2014of dollars.</p><p>Her, Giselle Smith. Boring brown hair, dirt-colored eyes. Too short, and definitely too heavy. The most interesting thing about her was her name. Which people always got wrong anyway.</p><p>Obviously a serial killer, she thought sadly. Well, we\u2019ll have lunch in a public place where I can scream my head off if he starts sharpening his knives.</p><p>It was too bad. He was really something. What the hell could a guy like that want from a nobody like her?</p><p>Alec watched the woman (he was still angry at himself for not getting her name...or giving his, for that matter) from halfway down the block. His spot was excellent: he could see her perfectly and, better, he was downwind.</p><p>He thought about their conversation and cursed himself again. He\u2019d babbled like a moron, ordered her to lunch, stared at her like she was Little Red Riding Hood. Yes, like Little Red...hmmmmm.</p><p>He wrenched his mind from that delectable mental image</p><p>(the better to eat you with, my dear. eat you all...up!)</p><p>and concentrated on thinking about what an idiot he had been. It was a miracle the woman had said yes. It was a miracle she hadn\u2019t hit him over the head with her bell. He had to be very careful at lunch; it was imperative she not spook. He thanked God he was weeks away from his Change; if he\u2019d caught her scent any closer to the full moon, he\u2019d have scared the pants off her. Literally.</p><p>God, she was soadorable , look at her, shaking her little bell for all she was worth. Many people stopped (pulled in, no doubt, by her allure) and threw money in her bucket. As they should! They should give her gold bullion, they should lay roses at her feet, they\u2014</p><p>He pushed away from the wall, appalled; someone hadn\u2019t put money in! An expensively dressed man in his late thirties had used the bucket to make change, and went on his merry way.</p><p>Alec got moving. In no time he had closed the distance and flanked the man, had snaked out a hand and pulled him into a handy alley.</p><p>\u201cWha-aaaggh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is cashmere,\u201d Alec said, his hand fisting in the man\u2019s coat.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me,\u201d the man squeaked, reeking of stale piss\u2014the smell of fear. \u201cOr I\u2019ll yell rape!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour shoes,\u201d Alec continued, undaunted, \u201care from Gerbard inLondon , and didna cost you less than eight hundred pounds.\u201d Only Samuel Gerbard used that kind of supple leather when making his footwear; the smell was distinctive. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a Coach briefcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGggglllkkkk!\u201d</p><p>Perhaps he was holding the man a little too firmly. Alec released his grip. \u201cThe point is, you c\u2019n stand to share a little this holiday season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back,\u201d he growled, \u201cand put money. In. The bucket.\u201d</p><p>He let go. The man fled. In the right direction\u2014toward his Santa sweetie.</p><p>A minute later, Alec was back at his post. He checked his watch for the thirtieth time in the last half hour. Ninety minutes to go. An eternity.</p><p>An eternity later, at 11:57, he realized the skulking teenagers were ready to make their move. The three of them had been casing the block for the last fifteen minutes, had been watching his lunch date much too closely. It was the bucket, of course; they wanted lunch money...or the eight grand he\u2019d dropped in. It would be laughable, except one of them smelled like gun oil, which meant he had to take some care.</p><p>Their path took them right past him; he reached out and slammed the one with the gun into the side of the building. The boy\u2014a child in his late teens\u2014flopped bonelessly to the sidewalk.</p><p>His friends were a little slow to catch on; they finally turned when they nearly tripped over their unconscious leader. And saw Alec, standing over the unconscious punk, smiling. Well, showing them all his teeth, anyway. \u201cTake somebody else\u2019s bucket,\u201d he said. Oh, wait, that was the wrong message entirely. \u201cDon\u2019t take anybody\u2019s bucket,\u201d he called after them, but it was too late, they were running away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked at his watch again. It was noon!</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Giselle,\u201d she said to Hunka Hunka Burnin\u2019 Love. \u201cGiselle Smith. And you\u2019re...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlec Kilcurt. You have a lovely name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks. About that. The never-ending compliments. What is your deal? Now that I\u2019m out of costume, you can see I\u2019m nothing special.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her.</p><p>She frowned, but continued. \u201cToo short, too heavy\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed harder.</p> <p>\u201c\u2014but you keep complimenting me and I\u2019m waiting for the other shoe to drop. You\u2019re a census taker, right? A salesman? You want to sell me a fridge. A timeshare. A kidney. Stop laughing!\u201d</p><p>He finally sobered up, although the occasional snort escaped. He snapped his fingers, and the glorious redhead at the next table, who\u2019d been studying him while pretending to powder her nose, gave him her full attention. Her eyelashes fluttered. She licked her red, glistening lips.</p><p>Alec held out his hand, and after a puzzled moment the redhead placed her compact in his palm.</p><p>\u201cObliged,\u201d he said carelessly. Then he snapped it open, showed it to Giselle. \u201cThis is what my people call a mirror,\u201d he said in his ultra-cool Scottish brogue. \u201cY\u2019should spend more time looking in one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what a mirror is, you goob,\u201d she snapped. \u201cToo damn well. Stop shaking that thing at me or you won\u2019t get anything nice for Christmas.\u201d She nudged the bag at her foot; it held her costume. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends in high places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you getting angry with me?\u201d he asked, delighted. He handed the compact back to the redhead with barely a glance.</p> <p>\u201cYes, a little. You don\u2019t have to look so happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s just...I\u2019m a lot bigger than you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd almost as smart,\u201d she said brightly.</p><p>\u201cMost women find me a little intimidating.\u201d He smiled at her. Giselle felt her stomach tighten, then roll over lazily. God, what a grin. \u201cIn my...family...we treasure women who speak their minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve won the lottery today, pal. And you never answered my question. What are you up to?\u201d</p><p>He reached out, and his big hand closed over her small, cold one. His thumb burrowed into her palm, stroked it. Her stomach did another slow roll, one she felt distinctly lower. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m seducing you, of course,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Multiple internal alarms went off. \u201cWhoare you?\u201d she said, almost gasped.</p><p>\u201cNo one special. Just a lord looking for his lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve got a title, too? Well, of course you do. That\u2019s the way this day is going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Laird Kilcurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your name is Kilcurt. Isn\u2019t your title supposed to be completely different? Like Alec Kilcurt, laird of Toll House? Or something?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSomething. But my family does things a little differently. Too bad...I like the idea of being laird of chocolate chips.\u201d</p><p>The waiter came, refreshed their drinks, and put down the two dozen oysters she\u2019d ordered. She pulled her hand away, not without major reluctance. Since she figured this was her first and last date with the man, she\u2019d ordered recklessly. He\u2019d probably flip out when the bill came. Probably spent all his money on clothes and, given his trim waistline, only ate porridge once a day.</p><p>Wrong again. He nodded approvingly at the ridiculous size of her appetizer. He was leaning back in his chair, studying her. He had, if it was possible, gotten even better looking since morning. The expensive coat was off, revealing a splendid build showcased to perfection in a dark gray suit. His brogue, she noticed, came and went, depending on the topic of conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t lived inScotland your entire life,\u201d she observed, sucking down her second daiquiri. Normally not a big drinker, she felt the need for booze today.</p><p>\u201cNo. My family often had business on Cape Cod, so I spent a lot of time inMassachusetts . And I went to Harvard for graduate school. I\u2019ve probably lived inAmerica as many years as I\u2019ve lived inScotland .\u201d</p><p>Titled, gorgeous, rich, smart. Was she on Candid Camera, or what? \u201cThat makes sense...I noticed your accent comes and goes. I mean, sometimes it\u2019s really faint, and sometimes it\u2019s pretty heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s heavy,\u201d he replied, \u201cwhen I\u2019m tired. Or angry. Or...excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019sit ,\u201d she said, slamming her glass down. \u201cWhoare you? What do you want with me? I made $18,000 last year. I\u2019m poor, plain, cursed with child-bearing hips\u2014and ass\u2014and I\u2019m prospect-less. What the hell are you doing with me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes went narrow. \u201cI\u2019ll have to find the people who convinced you of such things. And have a long chat with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question, Groundskeeper Willie, or I\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p><p>He looked puzzled at her pop culture reference, but shrugged and answered easily enough. \u201cI\u2019m planning to spend the day getting you into my bed. And I\u2019m thinking about marrying you.That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing with you, my charming little chocolate treat.\u201d</p><p>She felt her mouth pop open. Felt her face get red. If this was a joke, it was a pretty mean one. If he was serious, he was out of his fucking mind. She seized on the one thing she could safely question. \u201cChocolate treat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes are the color of really good chocolate...Godiva milk, I think. And your hair looks like fudge sauce. Rich and dark. It contrasts nicely with your pale, pale skin. Your rosy cheeks are the...cherry on top.\u201d</p><p>She downed the rest of her drink in two monster gulps.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she groaned. Sweaty strands of hair were clinging limply to her face and temples.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fret. I\u2019ve been puked on before.\u201d</p><p>She groaned again, this time in complete humiliation. She hadn\u2019t thrown up near him. Hadn\u2019t thrown up around him. Had actually barfedon him. Onhim !</p><p>\u201cYou promised to kill me,\u201d she reminded him hoarsely. The elevator doors slid open and he scooped her easily into his arms, and carried her down the hallway. \u201cDon\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>His chest rumbled as he choked down a laugh. \u201cNow, I didna promise to kill you, sweetheart. Just to take you up to my room so you c\u2019n get your strength back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be all right once I get off my feet,\u201d she lied. Death was coming for her! She could feel its icy grip on the back of her neck. Or was that the ice from her third\u2014fourth?\u2014daiquiri? \u201cJust need to get off my feet,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, you\u2019re off them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up, what do you know?\u201d she said crossly, getting more and more dizzy as the ceiling tiles raced by. \u201cAnd slow down. And kill me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually ladies wait until the second date before begging me for death,\u201d he said, straight-faced. He paused outside a door, shifted his weight, and somehow managed to produce the card key, unlock the door, and sweep her inside without putting her down.</p><p>Two hotel maids and a woman in a red business suit were waiting for them. Giselle had a vague memory of the woman in red examining her while the sound of running water went on and on in the next room. She kept fuzzing...that was the only way to describe it. One moment things would be crystal-clear\u2014too sharp, too loud\u2014and the next she could barely hear them for their mumbling. It was annoying, and she told them so. Repeatedly.</p><p>\u201c\u2014lukewarm bath make all the difference\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014just got so sick, it\u2019s verra worrisome\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014mild food poisoning\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014she\u2019ll be okay in no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014close to your Change for it to be a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014canceled my flight earlier, so she can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014push fluids\u2014\u201d</p><p>She reached up blindly. What\u2019s-his-name</p><p>(Alec? Alex?)</p><p>caught her hand, held it tightly. \u201cWhat is it, sweetie? D\u2019you want something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to STOP YELLING! How can I quietly expire if you keep screaming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll try t\u2019keep it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019t humor me, either,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cOh, now, what\u2019s this happy crappy?\u201d Because now she was being undressed and helped off the bed. \u201cLook, stop this! Isn\u2019t there an ice bucket or a hammer or something in here? All you have to do is hit me in the headreallyhard and my problems will be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel better in twenty-four hours!\u201d the woman in red screamed.</p><p>\u201cJesus, do I have to get out the hand puppets so you people understand? Not so loud! And I\u2019ll be dead,dead in twenty-four hours, thank you very much, and\u2014where are we going?\u201d</p><p>The bathroom. Specifically, the bathtub. She started to protest that a change of temperature in her state would kill her, but the lukewarm water felt so blissful she stopped in mid-squawk.</p><p>And that was all. For a very long time.</p><p>Giselle woke up and knew two things at once: 1) she would burst if she didn\u2019t get to a bathroom within seconds, and 2) she was ravenous.</p><p>She stumbled through the darkness into the bathroom, availed herself of the facilities for what felt like half a day, and brushed her teeth with the new tooth brush she found on the counter.</p><p>While she swished and gargled and spat, the day\u2019s humiliating events came back to her. Working the bell, meeting Alec, being wined and dined\u2014and God, he\u2019d beenflirting with her!\u2014then throwing up on him (groan) and the table tipping away from her.</p><p>Everything after that was, as they say, a blur. Mercifully so. She wondered where Alec was. She wondered whereshe was.</p><p>She stepped back into the hotel room\u2014Alec\u2019s hotel room\u2014and stole to the window. She saw an astonishing view of the New England Aquarium and, beyond that,Boston harbor. It was very late; after midnight, but well before dawn; the sky was utterly black but there was little traffic moving. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So she was on the wharf, then. Probably the Longwharf Marriott. She\u2019d often wondered, walking by, what it would be like to stay there with someone glorious.</p><p>Well, now she knew.</p><p>She turned to look for the light and saw Alec for the first time. He was sitting in the chair by the door, watching her. His eyes gleamed at her from the near dark.</p> <p>She screamed and would have fallen out the window if it had been open. As it was, she rapped her head a good one on the glass.</p><p>\u201cYes, a typical date in nearly every respect,\u201d he said by way of greeting.</p><p>\u201cAnd a good evening to you, too, dammit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scared thecrap out of me.\u201d When she\u2019d first seen him\u2014it was a trick of the light, obviously\u2014but his eyes had\u2014well, had seemed to gleam in the dark, the way a cat\u2019s did at night. Very off-putting, to say the least. \u201cYour eyes, Jesus!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe better to see you with, my dear. And it\u2019s Alec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d She leaned against the radiator, panting from the adrenaline rush. \u201cNever do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He swallowed a chuckle. \u201cI was watching you sleep. When you got up and made such a determined beeline to the bathroom, I was afraid to do anything that might slow you down. Were you sick again, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no. And about this afternoon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2014er\u2014gifted me with your daiquiris and oysters and swordfish and hash browns andtarte tatin ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s never speak of it again,\u201d she said determinedly.</p> <p>He laughed, delighted, stood in such an abrupt movement if she\u2019d blinked she\u2019d have missed it, and crossed the room. In another moment he was holding her hands. \u201cI\u2019m so glad t\u2019see you\u2019re better,\u201d he said with such obvious sincerity she smiled\u2014for the first time in hours, it seemed. \u201cI was worried.\u201d Except in his charming brogue, it came outsae glad tae see yerrr betterrrrrr .Ai wooz worred.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty damned glad to be feeling better myself. God, I\u2019ve never been so sick! I guess I\u2019d be a terrible alcoholic,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>\u201cIt wasna the alcohol. The doctor said it was food poisoning. I\u2019fact this hotel is full...quite a few guests of the restaurant suffered from the oysters and are resting up because of it.\u201d</p><p>She thought she ought to pull her hands out of his grip, but couldn\u2019t bring herself to take the step. His hands around hers were warm\u2014almost hot\u2014and looking up into his unbelievable face was just too good right now. \u201cWhat doctor? Was she the lady in the red dress? I remember someone in red who wouldn\u2019t stop with the shrieking...\u201d</p><p>Alec\u2019s lips quirked in a smile. \u201cDr. Madison is a verra soft spoken woman, actually. You were just sensitive to noise while you were sick. I called her when you\u2014uh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember. We\u2019re not speaking of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014became indisposed,\u201d he finished delicately, but he wouldn\u2019t quit smiling. \u201cShe helped me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Touched, she squeezed his hands. \u201cThanks, Alec. I guess I was a lucky girl to be out with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLucky?\u201d The smile dropped away. \u201cIt was my fault you got sick, so the least I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fault? Held me down and shoveled in the oysters, did you?\u201d she said dryly. \u201cHardly. In case you haven\u2019t noticed the inordinate size of my ass, I\u2019m a girl with a healthy appetite. I got so incredibly sick because I ate so incredibly much.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her fingers in response. She had a sudden sense of crushing power held in check. \u201cI adore your ass.\u201dAi adorrrre yuir arse. Was she crazy, or was his brogue getting thicker by the second? What had he said? That it came out when he was angry or...</p><p>Or...</p><p>She snatched her hands out of his grip. \u201cPaws off, monkey boy. Time for me to get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer it if you didn\u2019t call me that,\u201d he said, mildly enough. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an insult where I come from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got a real mad-on against monkeys inScotland , eh? Whatever. Gotta go now, it\u2019s been fun, buh-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t go.\u201d He folded his arms across his chest and smirked at her. \u201cYour clothes were quite ruined in the incident-that-shall-ne\u2019er-be-named.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, she realized she was wearing a flannel nightgown. It had a demure lace collar which scratched her chin, and the hem fell about three inches past her toes.How could she not have noticed this before? She\u2019d just used the bathroom, for God\u2019s sake. Sure, she\u2019d had to pee so bad nothing else had registered, but...she made a quick grab and found shewas wearing her old panties beneath the gown. Whew!</p><p>His eyebrows arched while she groped herself, but he wisely said nothing. \u201cThe doctor said you needed rest and quiet until you\u2014er\u2014purged your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d He turned brisk. \u201cI had the staff send up something for you to sleep in.\u201d</p><p>Any thoughts he was embarked on sinister seduction fled as she fingered the gray flannel. She felt like an extra onThe Little House on the Prairie. \u201cThanks.\u201d She smiled in spite of herself. \u201cFlannel?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s cold where I come from. I wanted you to be comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am,\u201d she assured him with a straight face. \u201cBut I would be more comfortable if I got the hell out of a stranger\u2019s hotel room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStranger?\u201d He grinned at her, all devil and mischief. \u201cAfter all we\u2019ve been through today? Shame!\u201d</p><p>She laughed; she couldn\u2019t help it. Quick as thought, his hand came up and caught one of her curls; he pulled it and watched it spring back. Uck. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really...I know, I look like Bozo the Clown on mescaline. If Bozo didn\u2019t have red hair. And was really short. And was a woman. You should see it in the summer...giant fuzzball! Hide your children!\u201d</p><p>He was eyeballing her hair. \u201cI\u2019d like to see it in the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkey-dokey,\u201d she said, humoring him, \u201candI would love to see my uniform. I can wear my Santa suit on the subway home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt two o\u2019clock in the morning? Alone?\u201d He sounded mortally offended. \u201cI think not. Besides...\u201d His voice became sly. \u201cAren\u2019t you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Hungry! Oh, God, no one in the history of Santa bellin\u2019 for bucks had ever been this hungry. She actually swayed on her feet at the thought of eating.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl. Let\u2019s call room service. Anything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to get my wallet\u2014\u201d</p><p>He frowned forbiddingly. \u201cDo not get your wallet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, we\u2019ll fight about it later. Where\u2019s the menu? God, I could eat acow .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling.\u201d</p><p>She ordered a steakau jus , rare, with mashed potatoes and gravy and broccoli and half a loaf of wild rice bread. \u201cThis is going to be really expensive,\u201d she warned him. \u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite sure. It\u2019s such a relief to be with a woman who eats.\u201d He sat beside her on the bed and sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll never understand the American custom of starvation. You\u2019re the richest country in the world and the women don\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, not guilty. As you can see by the size of my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTempting. Let\u2019s see how well you do with your dinner first.\u201d</p><p>She glanced uncertainly at him, caught his low-lidded look. It seemed incredible, but the man was actually turned on at the thought of her non-toned ass. His words hadn\u2019t been enough to convince her, but his thickening brogue was telling.</p><p>It was all very strange. Not to mention marvelous. And oh-so-slightly alarming.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>She did very well. Polished it all off, then ordered ice cream. He watched in pure delight. And thanked God again he was nowhere near his Change.</p><p>Keeping his hands\u2014and mouth!\u2014to himself was beginning to be a sore task. It hadn\u2019t been a problem when she\u2019d been so miserably ill, but she was obviously feeling better...he could hardly talk to her; his tongue felt thick in his mouth. She was just so\u2014just so adorable, alive and sexy and fragrant. When he\u2019d tugged on one of her glossy curls, it had taken nearly everything he had to keep from plunging both hands in her hair and taking her mouth.</p><p>He\u2019d been wild with worry for her, hadn\u2019t left her side for a moment since she threw up her lunch on his shoes. He was going to see that chef\u2019s head on a pike\u2014or his name on a termination slip\u2014before the sun set again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d she sighed, patting her mouth with a napkin. It was a lovely mouth; wide-lipped and generous. When she smiled, the upper lip formed a sorceress\u2019s bow. He had to concentrate very hard onnot sucking that lip into his mouth. \u201cNow. About my imminent departure. Not that you haven\u2019t been a perfect gentleman. Because you have. Yes, indeedy! But, bottom line, I haven\u2019t known you for twenty hours.\u201d She stood and began pacing. \u201cSo I\u2019m definitely not sleeping in your hotel room. Anymore, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019don\u2019t sleep,\u201d he teased, catching her hand and pulling her toward him. Her dark gaze caught him, held him. A line appeared between her eyebrows as she frowned. He kissed the line.</p><p>\u201cNow listen here, Grabby McGee...ah!\u201d</p><p>He kissed the sweet slope of her neck. And was lost. He might not have been, had she not instinctively leaned into the caress of his mouth. He reached up, found the soft splendor of her hair, and caught her mouth with his. She smelled like surprise and vanilla bean ice cream.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she said, almost groaned, into his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re like a dream. The best dream I ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m sorry, your accent\u2014\u201d She giggled and kissed his chin. \u201cIt\u2019s so thick I can barely understand you. Which, by the way, I\u2019ll take as a compliment to my own massive sexiness.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cY\u2019should. Stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She was wriggling\u2014regretfully, but still wriggling\u2014out of his grasp. Trying, anyway. He had no trouble whatsoever keeping her in the circle of his arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019d love to. I can\u2019t. Leggo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you must.\u201d He found her breast\u2014not easy, given its encasement in sensible gray flannel\u2014and cupped it in his palm. The firm, warm weight made his head swim. \u201cYou\u2019re for me and I\u2019m for you, lovely Giselle. Besides, I\u2019m not going to let you leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, what if you heave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I thought\u2014look, I feel fine. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be sick again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if y\u2019are? I promised Dr. Madison I\u2019d look after you for the next twenty-four hours. It\u2019s only been about six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I feel fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...if you promised...and if it\u2019s doctor\u2019s orders...\u201d She was weakening. She wanted to be persuaded. So he\u2019d persuade her, by God.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>One minute they were having a (reasonably) civilized conversation, and the next his hands were everywhere. Her nightclothes were tugged, pulled, and finally torn off her. His weight bore her back on the bed.</p><p>\u201cAlec!\u201d Surprise made her voice squeakier than usual. \u201cFor crying out loud, I feel like I\u2019m caught in an exercise machine\u2014yeek!\u201d \u2018Yeek\u2019 because his head was suddenly, shockingly between her breasts, his long fingers were circling one of her nipples, then tugging impatiently on the bud. Heat shot through her stomach like a comet. And speaking of comets, what the hell wasthat pressing against her leg?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is what the doctor had in mind\u2014\u201d she began again.</p> <p>\u201cGiselle, my own, my sweet, I would do nearly anything you asked.\u201d He was having this conversation with her cleavage. \u201cBut will you please stop talking for just a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. I reserve the right to chat if you\u2019ve reserved the right to rip up my nice new nightgown,\u201d she informed the top of his head. And her old panties. Well, at least it wasn\u2019t laundry day. No Granny underpants on her, thank you very much!</p><p>She was striving to sound coolly logical, matter-of-fact, but his mouth was busy nibbling and kissing and licking; it was too damned wonderful. Distracting! She meant distracting. She ought to kick him in the \u2018nads. Whywasn\u2019t she kicking him in the \u2018nads? Or at least screaming for help?</p><p>Because he wouldn\u2019t hurt her. Because he wanted her with a clear, hungry passion no man had ever shown her. Because she had a crush on him the size ofAustralia . Because if she screamed he might stop.</p><p>\u201cUh...help?\u201d she said weakly, a moment before he rose up and his mouth was on hers. He smelled clean and masculine; his lips were warm and firm and insistent. His tongue traced her lower lip, then thrust into her mouth. Claimed it. His groin was pressing against hers and she could feel his...er...pulse.</p><p>She tore her mouth from his, not without serious regret. If he kissed her likethat again, it was all over. Good-bye, good-girl rep. Hello, new life as a slut puppy. \u201cCondoms!\u201d she shouted into his startled face. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you a hundred bucks you don\u2019t have any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t,\u201d he said indignantly. He was\u2014ack!\u2014shrugging out of his shirt. His chest was tanned (in December!) and lightly furred with black hair. She actually moved to see if his chest hair was as crisp as it looked, then pulled her hands back and clenched them into fists. \u201cI didna come here to mate. Have sex, I mean. I\u2019m here on business. I never thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s a problem, Buckaroo Banzai, because I didn\u2019t exactly line my bra with prophylactics, either. Which means looky but no nooky. In fact,\u201d she added on a mutter, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t even looky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re on the Pill\u2014ow, dammit!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d formed a fist and smacked him between the eyes. The only way he would have known she was taking birth control pills is if he had gone through her purse while she was sick; she\u2019d stopped at the pharmacy on the way to work and picked up her prescription.</p><p>\u201cWe had to,\u201d he said, as if reading her mind. He rubbed the red spot on his forehead, which was rapidly fading. \u201cDr. Madison was concerned we\u2019d have to take you to the hospital. She needed to know if you were taking any medication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA likely story,\u201d she grumbled, but it sounded plausible, so she didn\u2019t follow up with a headbutt. Not that she\u2019d ever done one in her life, but how hard could it be? \u201cAnd it\u2019s the Minipill, Mr. Knows-So-Much. Besides, I\u2019m not worried about getting pregnant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be,\u201d he teased. Except she doubted he was really teasing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about catching something. Without condoms our options are\u2014thank God\u2014limited. Saran Wrap and a rubber band? Forget it. For all I know you could be crawling with disease. I could be taking my life in my hands if I let you bone me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoneyou? Crawling\u2014\u201d He got up off her\u2014weep!\u2014and started to pace. Shirtless, and with an interesting bulge beneath his belt buckle. She struggled to keep her gaze on his face. Well, his shoulders, at least. \u201cFirst of all, my family\u2014we don\u2019t\u2014that is to say, I\u2019ve never been sick a day in my life, and no one I know has ever had\u2014er\u2014problems in that area. Second, I know for a factyou\u2019re disease-free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she asked curiously. He was right, of course, but how\u2019d he know?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to\u2014never mind. And third...third...\u201d He laughed unwillingly and ran a hand through his hair. It stuck up in all directions but, instead of looking silly, it only made him look immensely likeable. Adorably rumpled. \u201cGiselle, you\u2019re unlike any woman I\u2019ve ever known. You\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s just something about you. I can\u2019t put it into words. Come back toScotland with me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been busily arranging the covers over herself, though it was a bit late for modesty, and looked up. \u201cWhat?Scotland ? You mean, like a visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201c...sure. A visit.\u201d He grinned. \u201cStarting tomorrow, and ending never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Look, if you still feel like this tomorrow...later today, I mean...I could leave you my phone number.\u201dAnd never hear from you again, most likely.</p><p>\u201cWe need Santas inScotland ,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cIt can be a verra lonesome place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on!\u201d She started to get the giggles, and laughed harder when he pounced on her like a big cat. A good trick, since he\u2019d been standing several feet away from the bed. The man was in great shape, no doubt about it. \u201cNow, cut it out...get off, now! I told you, no condoms, no nooky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I could prove I wasn\u2019t\u2014er\u2014how did you put it? Crawling with disease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it how?\u201d she asked suspiciously. Part of her couldn\u2019t believe they were having this discussion. The last time she\u2019d had sex had been...uh...what year was it? Anyway, the point was, this wasso unlike her.</p><p>Well, why not? Why not jump without looking for once in her ridiculously dull life? The most interesting thing about her was her name...Mama Smith had been Jane Smith, of all the rotten jokes, and wanted her kid to be remembered. It didn\u2019t work. Short, plump women with brown hair and brown eyes weren\u2019t exactly noticed on the street.</p><p>Until today.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cand back off a minute, let me think.\u201d She pinched his nipple, hard. He yelped and reared back. \u201cThat\u2019s better. Okay, if you can prove you\u2019re disease-free, I\u2019ll stay the night with you.\u201d She forced herself to meet his gaze. Her face was so red she was sure her head was going to explode, like that poor schmuck inScanners . \u201cI\u2019ll do anything you want until the sun comes up. You\u2019ve got my word on it. And a Smith never goes back on her word. This Smith, anyway,\u201d she finished in a mutter.</p><p>He looked at her, wide-eyed. Then turned so quickly\u2014snake-quick, it was uncanny\u2014and grabbed for the telephone.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, who are you calling?\u201d she asked, alarmed. She hadn\u2019t thought he could prove a damn thing at two o\u2019clock in the morning. \u201cIf it\u2019s some buddy inScotland who\u2019s gonna back you up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m callingMassachusetts GeneralHospital ,\u201d he said, grinning widely. \u201cGood enough? Dr. Madison has staff privileges there. She\u2019s been looking after my family for years and years. She\u2019ll tell you all about my medical history if you like.\u201d</p><p>He put the phone on speaker, so she could hear the hospital operator.Madison was paged, and soon came to the phone.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling, dear?\u201d she asked. She also had an accent, this one the clipped intonation of a blue blood Bostonian. \u201cI had a terrible time calming Alec down while you were ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014ack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idle chit-chat,\u201d Alec said in her ear, and ran a finger all the way down her spine.</p><p>She turned and slapped his hand away, then grabbed for the receiver so Alec wouldn\u2019t hear the rest of the conversation. \u201cI\u2019m fine, much better...listen, does Alec have any STDs that I, as a potential\u2014ack!\u2014sexual partner should know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSTDs? You mean like AIDS or\u2014oh dear\u2014\u201d</p><p>Giselle held the phone away, the better not to be deafened by the woman\u2019s shriek of laughter. A few seconds later, Doc Madison had it under control: \u201cSorry about that. I give you my word as a physician and a lady, Alec has never been sick a day in his life. Nor any of his family. They\u2019re a...a healthy lot.\u201d Another chuckle. \u201cWhy do I have the feeling I\u2019ll be seeing more of you, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats the hell out of me. Okay, then, tha\u2014\u201d That was as far as she got before Alec was tossing the phone across the room, and her back on the bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think this is an excellent time to be afraid. For one thing, a) you\u2019re a lot bigger than I am, and b) I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll tackle me before I get to the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA) you\u2019re right, and b) you\u2019re right. You\u2019re welcome t\u2019try, though.\u201d His eyes gleamed. \u201cI like to play Chase.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Jesus. She slid from the bed and he was right behind her. \u201cNow, now,\u201d he said, almost purred, \u201ca promise is a promise. Right, Giselle sweetie?\u201d</p><p>Odd, the way he said that...like it was one word: Gisellesweetie. She liked it. Liked him. And a good thing, too, since they were about to get down to it. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I gave my wormmmphhh!\u201d His mouth was on hers, he was pulling her toward him and she went up on her tiptoes. His tongue was in her mouth, jabbing and darting, and she could actually feel that between her legs. One of his hands was on the back of her neck, holding her firmly to him. The other arm was around her waist\u2014luckily he had long arms.</p><p>He broke the kiss. With difficulty, she was delighted to see. As for herself, she was panting as if she\u2019d just run a marathon. And as elated as if she\u2019d just won one. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, almost gasped. \u201cYou said anything. That you\u2019d do anything. Until the sun came up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was hard to breathe. Black excitement swamped her. A promise was a promise, dammit, and she had his personal physician\u2019s word that he wasn\u2019t sick. More, she trusted him implicitly. She had been handed a fantasy on a plate, and meant to take full advantage. After tonight she\u2019d never see him again. But by God, she had tonight. \u201cYes, anything. Anything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoooh, verra good,\u201d he crooned, almost growled. He sank to the bed and pulled her down with him. And kept pushing her down until she was on her knees, facing him. \u201cUnbuckle my belt. Please,\u201d he added with a wolfish grin.</p><p>She did, with fingers that were clumsy and stupid. She finally pulled the belt free and wordlessly handed it to him. He tossed it in a corner. \u201cSince you\u2019re keeping your promise\u2014so far\u2014we likely won\u2019t be needing that .\u201d She gulped\u2014what the hell had she gotten herself into? \u201cNow. My slacks, love. All the way off.\u201d</p><p>She did so, and then, when asked, relieved him of his boxers. It was too dark in the room to see their color\u2014navy blue? puce?\u2014but by their slippery feel she guessed they were made of silk. No flannel for him .</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he breathed. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>She understood him perfectly, and kissed the head of his cock, then rubbed her cheek against him like a cat. He smelled warm and musky and undeniably male. He was also quite thick; she had difficulty closing her fingers around him. \u201cAgain,\u201d he groaned, \u201ckiss me again, Giselle sweetie.\u201d</p> <p>She did so, tasting the saltiness of pre-come. She licked it off, then licked up and down the length of him. She could feel his bristly pubic hairs tickling her chin on the down stroke. His hand came up, caught a handful of her curls, fisted. \u201cNow,\u201d he growled, \u201copen your mouth. Wide.\u201d His voice was so gritty she could hardly understand him, but it didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to understand what he wanted\u2014needed. Then he was filling her mouth, her throat. He withdrew in time for her to take a breath, then was in her mouth again. His hips were pistoning toward her face and she realized he was fucking her mouth . While part of her was wildly excited, her practical side reminded her that although she could count the number of blow jobs she had given on one hand, she was definitely not a swallower.</p><p>His other hand had found her breasts and he was kneading, squeezing. The sensation of his hands on her, his cock in her mouth, was as exciting as it was overwhelming. She tried to pull back but his grip tightened, and then she felt him start to throb. Shockingly, suddenly, her mouth was flooded with musky saltiness and she reared back, but he had a grip like iron. In a second he had pulled free of her but clapped a hand over her mouth. \u201cSwallow,\u201d he murmured in her ear. \u201cAll of it. Right down.\u201d Aoull oof it. Ret daeown.</p><p>She did. \u201cBastard!\u201d she cried, making a fist and smacking him on the thigh. \u201cA little warning next time, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cThe next time I\u2019m about to come in your mouth, I\u2019ll give ye ample warning. Ouch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done that before.\u201d</p><p>He was rubbing his thigh where she\u2019d pinched him, hard. \u201cI could tell.\u201d</p><p>Incredibly, pierced vanity was now warring with outraged propriety. \u201cWell, hell , I\u2019m not exactly known as Slut Girl around here, and besides, I didn\u2019t exactly plan\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped her with a kiss. \u201cYou were wonderful,\u201d he said warmly. He nuzzled her nose for a moment. \u201cAnd I\u2019m verra sorry if I startled ye. But I needed ye t\u2019do that for me. Now I can touch you wi\u2019 a clear head. Now the fun can really start.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re still a bastard,\u201d she said sulkily. She could still taste him in her mouth, her throat. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to make me\u2014\u201d</p><p>His smile flashed in the dark. \u201cWell enough. But now it\u2019s y\u2019turn, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>Her irritation lessened as he eased her back on the bed and knelt between her legs, disappeared entirely as she realized he was going to be as good as his word.</p><p>It seemed as though he spent hours between her thighs: kissing, nibbling, sucking, and licking, ah, God, the licking. Lots of it, slow and steady; the man never got tired. In no time her clit was enthusiastically throbbing, and that\u2019s when he started paying special, extended, loving attention to the little button Giselle hardly thought of unless she was enjoying the evening with Mr. Shaky.</p><p>His tongue darted and stroked; she could feel its warm, wet length sliding and slipping between her throbbing lips. Felt him sucking on her clit with a single-minded enthusiasm that was as exciting as it was astonishing.</p><p>After a while she was squirming all over the bed, trying to get away from the delectable torture of his mouth. He wouldn\u2019t\u2014he\u2014he never stopped, never got tired, just kept at her, at her, at her. Lick lick lick and suck suck suck and even small, tender bites. She could feel herself getting drenched and would have blushed if she hadn\u2019t been so close to shrieking. She\u2019d start to feel her orgasm approach, and he\u2019d somehow know, and back off. Instead of giving her the last few flicks of his tongue to push her over the brink, he\u2019d move to her inner labia and gently suck them until she was no longer close to coming, or his tongue would delve inside her\u2014so deeply!\u2014leaving her clit bereft.</p><p>\u201cOh, God , y\u2019smell so damned good!\u201d After that breathless declaration he buried his face between her legs and commenced tormenting her anew. His hands spread her thighs so wide her knees were almost parallel, baring her fleshy mound for his hungry mouth. He started licking her in long, slow, agonizing slurps, from bottom to top, over and over and over. Her back bowed and she was certain she was about to lose her mind if she didn\u2019t come now .</p><p>So she squirmed and wriggled, and when she made progress getting away from him he simply grasped her thighs and pulled her back to his mouth. This went on for about seventeen years, until he tired of playing with her, sucked her clit into his mouth, and slipped two fingers inside her. The feeling of his warm lips on her, his long fingers in her, was exquisite, mind-boggling. His fingers moved, stroked, pushed hard inside her, pressure that was just short of discomfort, pressure that was amazing, mind-boggling. His lips had closed over her clit while his tongue flicked back and forth with dizzying rapidity. Her orgasm crashed over her like a wave and she shrieked at the ceiling.</p><p>When he came up to lie beside her, she was still shaking. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God . Do you have a license to do that? You ought to be against the law.\u201d She reached out and did what she had longed to do an hour ago: gently stroked his chest hair, then followed a path down to his groin. She found him thick, hard, and ready for her. He sucked in breath when she gently closed her fingers around him. \u201cBy the way,\u201d she added cheerfully, if breathlessly, \u201cI\u2019m on to you. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re an ordinary guy. Not that I mind.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, though whether it was from what she had said, or what her fingers were doing, she couldn\u2019t tell. She was squeezing and releasing, squeezing and releasing. Her other hand slipped lower until she was cradling his testicles in her palm, testing their warm weight. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a butterfly\u2019s touch, Giselle sweetie,\u201d he said, almost groaned.</p><p>She almost giggled; she\u2019d never pictured her plump self as something so light and delicate as a butterfly. Alec was no doubt mumbling nonsense because all the blood had left his head some time ago, and gone significantly southward.</p><p>She slipped her hand up, down, up, down, with excruciating slowness, with all the care he had shown her a few moments ago. She wasn\u2019t terribly experienced, but she was well read. She\u2019d been buying Emma Holly\u2019s books for years. \u201cThat\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t mess with a bookworm,\u201d she whispered in Alec\u2019s ear. \u201cWe know some pretty good stuff.\u201d He didn\u2019t answer her, but because she had brought her palm across his slippery tip and circled, circled, circled while her other hand stroked, she didn\u2019t expect him to.</p><p>She had meant to keep playing with him as long as she could draw it out, but he suddenly jerked away from her and kneed her thighs apart. He was terse, silent, but oh, how his hands were shaking. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you buy me dinner first? Again, I mea\u2014eeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEE!\u201d He entered her with one brutal thrust, all the way, all at once. She was slick, more than ready for him, but it was startling\u2014a little frightening, even\u2014all the same.</p><p>He started to drive himself into her.</p><p>She squirmed beneath him, felt her eyes roll back in her head...ah, Jesus, this was almost too much! Almost. \u201cAlec.\u201d</p><p>His hips were shoving against hers, his eyes were tightly closed; his mouth was a narrow line. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered. \u201cM\u2019sorry.

So sorry.\u201d His hands were on her shoulders, pinning her down, keeping her in place for him. His sex was rearing between her legs, into her, out of her. Digging, shoving, filling her.</p> <p>\u201cAlec. If you do it a little faster, I\u2019ll be able to come again.\u201d</p><p>That got his attention; his eyes opened wide. And then he smiled, a grin of pure male satisfaction. And obliged. She heard the headboard start slamming against the wall and didn\u2019t give a tin shit. She wriggled for a moment until he let go of her shoulders, then brought her arms around him and her legs up. And started doing a little pumping of her own. Their bellies clapped together, a lustful, urgent beat.</p><p>His eyes rolled back: \u201cAh, Jesus !\u201d His mouth found hers and he kissed her savagely, biting her mouth, her lips. Then he abruptly pulled back, as if aware he was nearing a line he wasn\u2019t ready to cross with her\u2014absurd, given what they were engaged in. His head dropped and she could feel his face pressing against the hollow between her neck and shoulder. There was a sharp pain as he bit her.</p><p>He\u2019s marking me, she thought. She heard a purring tear as he tore the sheets. He\u2019s making me his own . That thought\u2014so complicated, so strange, and so completely marvelous\u2014spun her into orgasm.</p><p>He stiffened over her as she cried out; his grip tightened\u2014painful for a split second, then he relaxed. \u201cDo that again,\u201d he growled in her ear, then bit her earlobe.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she gasped, almost groaned. And still he was busy, still he was fucking her with long, fast strokes.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014can\u2019t!\u201d Pump, pump, pump, and her neck stung where he had bitten her. As if sensing her thought, he bent to her and licked the bite, then kissed her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI need to feel your sweet little cave tightening around me again,\u201d he said into her mouth. \u201cI must insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done, please, I can\u2019t anymore, please, Alec\u2014\u201d Oh, but her body was betraying her, she was arching her back so as to better meet his thrusts, and she could feel that now-familiar tightening between her thighs, the feeling that told her she would do it again, thank you very much. \u201cAlec, please stop, please, I can\u2019t. Stop! St\u2014\u201d Then it was singing through her, tearing through her, and this one made the other two seem like mild tickling in comparison, this one was the biggest thing to ever happen to her.</p><p>She felt him stiffen above her again, but, oh, Christ, he wasn\u2019t done, he was still thrusting. He seized her knees and pushed them wide, spreading her, making her wider for him. She screamed in pleasure and despair: more of this was sure to kill her. It\u2019d be the best death ever, but it\u2019d still be death.</p> <p>\u201cMore,\u201d he muttered in her ear.</p><p>\u201c...can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan.Will.\u201d</p><p>She reached down, stroked his ass, felt, groped...then shoved her finger inside him, right up his ass, as far as she could. At the same time she clenched around him</p><p>(thank you, Kegel exercise)</p><p>and was gratified to hear his hoarse shout. Then he was pulsing inside her and throwing his head back and roaring at the ceiling. The headboard gave one more loud THUMP!, and was quiet.</p><p>She sobbed for breath and he soothed her with gentle strokes and small kisses. \u201cShhhh, sweetie, you\u2019re all right. I just don\u2019t think I am. Shhhh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was\u2014that\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEasy. Shush, now. Get your breath back.\u201d</p><p>As the ripples from her last, titanic orgasm faded, she realized she still throbbing. Still wanted him. She was a bookworm cursed with the body of a slut.</p><p>\u201cThat was\u2014mmbelievable. \u2018Mazing.\u201d Oh, great, she was babbling like a cheerleader after her fifth beer. She tried again. \u201cUnbelievable. Amazing. I\u2019m sure you hear this all the time, but that was the best ever . I don\u2019t mean for me. I mean in the history of lovemaking.\u201d</p><p>He was kissing her forehead, her mouth, her cheeks. \u201cFor me, also. And I don\u2019t hear it all the time. I haven\u2019t been with a lady in almost a year.\u201d</p><p>She nearly fell off the bed. \u201cWhat? Why ? You\u2019re so\u2014I mean, the overall package is just\u2014and then what you can do in the bedroom\u2014what the hell have you been waiting for? Did you lose a bet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not. Who,\u201d he said. \u201cWho the hell have I been waiting for. That\u2019s the question.\u201d He bent and nuzzled her cleavage. \u201cGod, I could get lost in you. So easily. Which means I have to kill you or marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHar, har. And get your nose out of there, it tickles.\u201d She could feel his cock on her thigh, very warm, and reached out. \u201cJesus! You\u2019re hard again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cI can\u2019t much help it if you\u2019ve got the sweetest cunt. Not to mention some very talented fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean...uh. I don\u2019t know what I mean.\u201d Their gaze met. Her eyes had long ago adjusted to the dark; she could see him quite well. \u201cDo you want to keep going?\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly; it was like an extra spoonful of sugar being stirred into really good coffee. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really relevant,\u201d she said tartly. His eyebrows arched. \u201cA promise is a promise, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I like about you\u2014one of the things\u2014is that you\u2019re not done. With me.\u201d His hand slid down the soft mound of her belly, cupped her between her legs. Then he gently parted her, and his fingers slid up inside her. She sucked in breath and moved with his hand. \u201cYou haven\u2019t closed off,\u201d he murmured into her mouth, \u201cthe way a lady will when she\u2019s had enough.\u201d She could hear herself whimpering softly as his fingers slid in and out and around, as he got slick with their juices. \u201cOf course, you have other qualities, very fine ones.\u201d His voice held a teasing note. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t have guessed at this one while I was wooing you over lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWooing me?\u201d she gasped. \u201cIs that what you were doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I was doing was concentrating on not bending you over the nearest table and taking you until my knees gave out. I\u2019m amazed I was able to talk to you at all\u2014ah, God, that\u2019s sweet, Giselle. Those sounds you make in the back of your throat make me forget everything. Come down here.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her until she was kneeling before the bed. She could feel him behind her, holding her around the waist, then stroking her buttocks and kneading the plump flush. \u201cI could bite you here about a hundred times,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cBetter not if you want to save room for breakfast.\u201d She yelped as his kneading inched toward pinching. \u201cEasy, Alec, I have to sit on that later.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed a laugh. \u201cSorry. But Giselle sweetie, you do have the most luscious ass.\u201d Then his hands moved lower until he was holding her open with his fingers. She could feel herself\u2014everything in her\u2014straining toward him. Silently begging for him.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Alec...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that, Giselle. I like hearing you groan my name.\u201d He eased into her, inch by delicious inch; she leaned forward and braced her arms on the bed. \u201cNow, if y\u2019don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to hear you scream it.\u201d He thrust, hard.</p><p>He stroked, and his hands were everywhere...running up and down her back, cupping her breasts, stroking her nipples...then roughly pulling them between his fingers, as if he instinctively knew when she wanted him to be sweet and when she wanted\u2014needed\u2014him to be rough. She screamed his name, begged him to stop screwing around and do her, dammit . He laughed in pure delight, laughed while she writhed and groaned and shoved back at him. Then his strokes pushed her into orgasm and he abruptly quit laughing and gasped instead.</p><p>She realized the sun had come up a while ago. Well, who gave a rat\u2019s ass? She couldn\u2019t believe the man\u2019s stamina. She couldn\u2019t believe her stamina.</p><p>\u201cGetting tired?\u201d he panted in her ear. He was still crouched behind her, still filling her the way no man ever had. When he braced himself and thrust, she swore she could feel his cock in her throat. \u201cGiselle? All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m exhausted, you big dolt, and don\u2019t you dare stop.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and she could feel his fingers dancing along the length of her spine. Then his hand came around and found her clit. He stroked the throbbing bud with his thumb and said, \u201cI wish my mouth was there right now. Later, it will be,\u201d and that was enough, that tipped her into another orgasm.</p><p>She felt his grip tighten on her. \u201cOh, God, that\u2019s so sweet,\u201d he groaned. \u201cHas anyone told you? When you come, your muscles lock.\u201d He shuddered behind her as he at last found his release. \u201cAll your muscles.\u201d</p><p>She giggled weakly and rested her head on the bed. Three times...or was that the fourth? The man wasn\u2019t human. Thank God she was on the Pill.</p><p>He stood, then picked her up and cradled her in his arms as if she were a child. \u201cYou\u2019ll sleep now,\u201d he said, laying her in the bed and covering her. \u201cAnd so will I...you\u2019ve worn me out, m\u2019lady.\u201d Then, incongruously, \u201cDo you have a passport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said drowsily.</p><p>\u201cHmm. I\u2019ll have to fix that. Can\u2019t come toScotland without one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still want me to come?\u201d She blushed, remember how they\u2019d spent the last five hours. \u201cToScotland , I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He was arranging the covers over himself, pulling her into his embrace, wrapping his long legs around hers. She was instantly warm and sinfully comfortable. The throbbing between her thighs had finally quit. It quit because you\u2019re numb, you twit. He\u2019s fucked you numb. And it was just fine . \u201cI said, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d She yawned against his shoulder. \u201cThat was before I gave up the goods, so to speak.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGiselle, darling.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019ve never known a woman so smart and so silly at the same time.

At the risk of making you more arrogant than you already are\u2014though how that\u2019s possible I just can\u2019t imagine\u2014I loved it. Hardly even hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She could hear the unmistakable relief in his tone. \u201cI\u2019m glad t\u2019hear it. I don\u2019t have an explanation except...I don\u2019t want you to think I go around biting just anybody. I just...lost myself in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, and you wanted to mark me,\u201d she added drowsily. Ah, even with that obnoxious light on, she was going to be able to get to sleep quite nicely. Take that, bedside lamp! \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I don\u2019t mind wearing your mark for a while.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarked me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArked-may E-may! Jesus, for a guy with heightened senses you\u2019re really slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t yell, I\u2019m right here. I forgot werewolves were so touchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteady, pal.\u201d Concerned, she sat up. He looked like he was going to pass out. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. I said it was, right? You marked me so another werewolf won\u2019t take it into his head to jump me. Theoretically, they\u2019ll see your mark and steer clear. Or lose their minds and decide, of all things, to fight for me. Ha! Like that\u2019d happen.\u201d</p> <p>She saw him lurch into the chair\u2014sitting down before he fell down. Very wise. \u201cYou know? About me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Not right away,\u201d she added comfortingly, since he looked so shattered. \u201cTook me a while to figure it out. But come on, you\u2019re a little too quick and too strong for a guy in his\u2014what? Early thirties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-one,\u201d he said absently.</p><p>\u201cPlus, your stamina between the sheets was\u2014was really something.\u201d Was she blushing? After what they had just shared? You\u2019re obviously overtired. Go to sleep, Giselle. \u201cI\u2019ve never met one\u2014a werewolf\u2014but my mom used to work for Lucius Wyndham.\u201d</p><p>He was staring at her with the most priceless look of astonishment on his face. \u201cYour mother worked for the former pack leader?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop with the yelling? Yes, she managed his stables for him. \u2018Course, he couldn\u2019t come near any of his horses without them going crazy trying to get away from him. He finally had to tell her the truth, because she thought he\u2019d abused them, and was getting ready to sic the ASPCA on him.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course he wasn\u2019t hurting them, it\u2019s just instinctive for horses to stay the hell away from werewolves. So he told her, and proved it to her, and she liked the horses, and liked him, and stayed on. \u2018Til she married my dad and moved toBoston . But she\u2019d seen a lot by then. My mom,\u201d Giselle added with satisfaction, \u201ctells the best bedtime stories. I figured you out a little while ago. I said so...remember?\u201d</p><p>He was shaking his head, his mouth hanging open. \u201cI just can\u2019t\u2014all night I\u2019ve been trying to figure out if I should just kidnap you t\u2019Scotland and tell you the truth over there\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTypical werewolf courtship,\u201d she sneered. \u201cYou guys really need to work on the romance thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr try to explain it to you tomorrow. Later today, I mean. Or wait until we knew each other better\u2014but you knew!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem polite, since you didn\u2019t bring it up.\u201d She blushed harder, like that was possible. \u201cBesides, we...had other things on our minds.\u201d</p><p>He burst into laughter, great, roaring laughs that made her ears ring. \u201cGiselle sweet, you\u2019re for me and I\u2019m definitely for you. I knew it the moment I smelled you. Ripe peaches in the middle of all those street smells and slush. The only Santa who was ovulating.\u201d He pounced on the bed and pulled her into his arms, kissing her everywhere he could.</p><p>\u201cJeez, cut it out!\u201d She was laughing and trying to fend him off. \u201cCan\u2019t we do this later? We ordinary humans get tired after making love all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing ordinary about you, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. You can\u2019t tell me that on that whole street, where there were probably a couple hundred people, the only one ovulating was me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t tell you that.\u201d He kissed her on the mouth. \u201cWhat I can tell you is that the only woman for me was ovulating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sleep now?\u201d she added helpful, groping for the bedside lamp.</p><p>He shut the light off for her. \u201cScotland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Sorry, my parents are from here. I have friends here, too. A life I made before I ever laid eyes on you, pretty boy. And, hello? Courtship, anybody? It\u2019d be nice to date a little, before we got married.\u201d</p><p>He mock-sighed. \u201cHumans, oh, Lord help me. A house inBoston , then, but at least half the year at my family home. After,\u201d he sighed again, \u201can appropriately lengthy courtship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked courtship?\u201d he asked hopefully.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ll work out the details. Doesn\u2019t really matter, though. Wither thou goest, I will go. And all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all that,\u201d he said, and kissed her smiling mouth.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
