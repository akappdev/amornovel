It isn\u2019t even their first kiss. But it feels like one.</p><p>Not because it is fumbling or awkward. Not because she doesn\u2019t know where to put her hand, or he doesn\u2019t know where to put his nose. None of those. They slot together like puzzle pieces. As Allyson and Willem kiss for the first time in a year, both are thinking the same thing: This feels new.</p><p>Though perhaps thinking is not the right term, because with a kiss like this, thinking goes out the window and something more instinctual takes over: inner voices, gut instincts. \u201cKnowing it in your kishkes\u201d is how Willem\u2019s saba would\u2019ve described it.</p><p>In his kishkes, Willem is marveling that Allyson found him, as Yael found Bram. He doesn\u2019t know how it happened, only that it did happen and that it means something.</p> <p>Allyson is doing a mental fist pump and an I told you so. She\u2019d spent a year looking for him, looking for the girl she was with him. And then last night, watching Willem perform Orlando in Vondelpark, she\u2019d been certain she\u2019d found them both, certain the words he was speaking were meant for her. Forever and a day. She\u2019d felt it. Right in her gut. But listening to that inner voice was new to Allyson. She\u2019d spent nineteen years of her life ignoring it, listening to pretty much everything but it. So when she\u2019d seen Willem with another woman, looking luminously happy with another woman, she\u2019d gone away.</p><p>Only not really. Because here she is, at his flat, where he is kissing her, and she is kissing him right back. And the kiss feels like something completely new. But it also feels like something deeply known. Which would seem to be a contradiction. Only it\u2019s not. The truth and its opposite are flip sides of the same coin, Saba always said.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Nothing goes on forever. Not even second first kisses. Not even those as hard-won as this. Outside the window, a tram bell chimes. It is like an alarm clock, crystallizing the moment from fuzzy to real. Allyson and Willem break apart.</p><p>Allyson isn\u2019t quite sure what to do next. She is supposed to be catching a flight to Croatia. This stop at Willem\u2019s flat was a detour, the kiss a happy surprise. But now what?</p> <p>Willem takes her backpack, as if answering the question, as if completing the transaction. Then he offers her a coffee.</p><p>He would like to kick himself. This girl he has not seen in a year, this girl he\u2019s thought about, dreamed about, looked for, for a year, this girl he just kissed (he\u2019s still a bit dazed from that kiss) . . . and his first words to her are those of a waiter.</p><p>But then he remembers something. \u201cOr a tea. You like tea, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>It is the smallest thing. She likes tea. She drank tea on the train to London, when they\u2019d first started talking, about hagelslag of all things. She drank it again on the train they\u2019d taken to Paris together, later that morning.</p><p>Tea. One day. A year ago. He remembered.</p><p>A little voice in Allyson\u2019s gut (it\u2019s her kishkes, only she doesn\u2019t know that word yet) is yelling: See?</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Allyson says. \u201cI would love some tea.\u201d She\u2019s not really thirsty. Five minutes ago, nerves had left her with a mouth as dry as paper, but the kiss has taken care of that. But this feels like more than a beverage being offered.</p><p>\u201cTea,\u201d Willem says. He can see that the offer has unfastened something in her face, as when she\u2019d jokingly solicited a compliment from him last year, and he\u2019d told her she was brave and generous and openhearted. Back then he\u2019d been guessing. Now he is remembering. He remembers it all. He wants to tell her. He will tell her.</p><p>But first, tea.</p><p>Willem starts toward the kitchen. Allyson isn\u2019t sure whether to follow him, but then he turns around and says, \u201cWait here,\u201d and then a few steps later adds, \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She sits down on the low leather couch. It is a nice apartment, all bright and sunny and modern. Does he live here? She hasn\u2019t thought about where he might live. About him living anywhere. When she\u2019d met him, he\u2019d lived out of a backpack.</p><p>In the kitchen, Willem tries to collect himself as he makes drinks. (He watches the kettle; the adage is true, it refuses to boil.) He digs through the cabinets for the tea that he recalls his uncle Daniel saying he kept for Fabiola, his soon-to-be wife, the soon-to-be mother of his child, whom he is now with in Brazil. Willem makes himself a coffee\u2014using the instant because it is faster and it has already taken too long for the water to boil.</p><p>He puts it all on a tray and returns to the lounge. Allyson is sitting on the sofa, her sandals off, neatly placed under the coffee table. (The sight of her bare feet. What this is doing to Willem\u2019s blood pressure. She might as well have taken off all her clothes.)</p><p>He puts the tray down on the coffee table and sits on the couch, but on the opposite side from Allyson. \u201cI hope chamomile is okay,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all my uncle has.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Allyson says. Then, \u201cYour uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaniel. This is his flat. I\u2019m staying here while he\u2019s in Brazil.\u201d</p><p>Allyson almost tells him she thought he lived in Utrecht, that was where she\u2019d tracked him down before the trail went cold. Or she\u2019d thought it went cold. Until she\u2019d accidentally heard about As You Like It being performed in Vondelpark last night and she somehow knew that Willem would be in it.</p><p>Accidents. All about the accidents. She wants to tell Willem this, is working out how to start without sounding like a complete lunatic, when he says: \u201cDaniel used to share this flat with my father, Bram. When they were young. And then my father met a girl while he was traveling. They spent a day together. Not even a day, a few hours, and a year later, she showed up here. She knocked on the door.\u201d</p><p>Like you just did, Willem thinks, but he doesn\u2019t say that. He doesn\u2019t want to sound like a complete lunatic.</p><p>\u201cYour mother,\u201d Allyson says.</p><p>\u201cYes. My mother. She\u2019s in India right now.\u201d He thinks of her. He cannot wait to tell her this. He takes a small moment to savor that, being eager to tell his mother something. Then he goes back to savoring Allyson, and her bare feet, which are right here. He never thought he had a thing for feet, but he is beginning to reconsider.</p><p>Allyson remembers Willem talking about his mother and father. It was during their conversation\u2014argument? debate?\u2014about love when Willem had smeared the Nutella on her wrist and licked it off. Allyson had challenged Willem to name one couple who hadn\u2019t just fallen in love but had remained in love, had stayed stained. Yael and Bram, he had said.</p><p>\u201cYael and Bram,\u201d Allyson says now, not even having to reach for the names.</p><p>She remembers Willem\u2019s sadness last summer. And immediately she knows, maybe she knew then, that there is no more Bram. Which isn\u2019t to say there is no more stain.</p><p>Yael and Bram. Something in Willem\u2019s chest catches. He\u2019d been right. He is known to this person. Has been from the very start.</p><p>He looks at her. She looks at him. \u201cI told you I would remember,\u201d Allyson says.</p><p>Before he\u2019d kissed her that night in the art squat, she had told him that she\u2019d remember everything about their day in Paris. That she would remember him.</p><p>Willem had made no such promises. But he can taste, touch, hear, and smell every last detail of that day together. \u201cI remember, too,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There is so much to say. It is like shoving all the sand of the world into an hourglass. Or trying to get it out.</p><p>But Willem\u2019s phone keeps ringing. He keeps ignoring it, until he remembers he promised he\u2019d call Linus back right before he opened the door to her.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit. Linus.\u201d He goes to fetch his mobile. Five missed calls.</p><p>Allyson looks curious. He tells her, \u201cI have to make a call.\u201d</p> <p>She thinks he will go into the other room to do it, but he doesn\u2019t. He sits down next to her.</p><p>The conversation is in Dutch so Allyson doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s saying, anyway. She can\u2019t really make much out from the look on his face, either: a half smile. A shoulder shrug. She\u2019s not sure if the news is good or bad.</p><p>Willem hangs up the phone. \u201cI\u2019m the understudy for Orlando in a play. Shakespeare again. As You Like It,\u201d he begins.</p><p>\u201cUnderstudy?\u201d Allyson asks. \u201cI thought you were Orlando.\u201d</p><p>Only for last night\u2019s performance. And tonight\u2019s. That\u2019s what Petra had decreed, Linus has just told him. Next week Jeroen, the actor Willem replaced, will come back, ankle cast and all, for a final weekend of performances. After this evening, Willem\u2019s services will no longer be needed, as actor or understudy. But he\u2019s on for tonight. In fact, they need him to come listen to notes before the 7:00 call. He is about to explain this all to Allyson, but then he stops himself.</p> <p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d he asks.</p><p>And then she says, \u201cI was there.\u201d</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Hadn\u2019t he felt her there? Hadn\u2019t he spoken his lines to her? But after all the false hopes of the last year, and after that letter Tor had told him about, he\u2019d thought he had conjured her. Maybe he had. Maybe he had done such a fine job of it, he\u2019d conjured her right into existence, into his uncle\u2019s flat, where she is now sitting, with her feet resting in his lap.</p><p>How did that happen? He vaguely remembers grabbing her ankles and laying her feet across his legs, casually, as if they were a blanket, but he can\u2019t be sure. It all feels like a dream and yet as natural as breathing. This is what you do. Put Allyson\u2019s feet into your lap.</p><p>\u201cYou were fantastic,\u201d Allyson tells him. \u201cMagnetic. It was like you were Orlando.\u201d</p><p>Willem had felt a kinship with Orlando, a bereaved young man inexplicably fallen in love with a girl who came and disappeared like a wisp of smoke. But the girl came back. (The girl came back.)</p> <p>\u201cI always thought you were good,\u201d she continues. \u201cEven when I saw you perform last year, the night we met, but it was nothing like last night.\u201d</p><p>The night they met. He\u2019d been doing Twelfth Night with Guerrilla Will, playing Sebastian. They hadn\u2019t spoken, but he\u2019d tossed her a coin at the end of the play. It was a flirtation, an invitation. God, he\u2019d had no idea then.</p><p>\u201cA lot has happened this year,\u201d Willem tells her.</p><p>When Allyson smiles, Willem is reminded of a sunrise. A bit of light, then more of it, then a burst of brightness. A sunrise is something you can see all the time and still marvel at. Maybe that is why her smile feels so familiar. He has seen many sunrises.</p><p>No, that is not why it feels familiar.</p><p>Allyson meanwhile is remembering. Why this person? All the things she has told herself, or other people have told her\u2014infatuation or Paris or good acting or lust\u2014no longer hold water, because she remembers so viscerally and feels it anew. It\u2019s not any of that. It\u2019s not even him. Or all him. It\u2019s her. The way she can be with him.</p><p>It was so new that day: the liberation of being honest, of being brave, maybe a little stupid. She\u2019s had a bit more practice at it now, the past few weeks alone in Europe, a lot of practice. She knows this girl pretty well now.</p><p>\u201cA lot has happened to me too,\u201d she tells Willem.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>They tell the story in bits, in tandem. The parts already known: Willem being concussed. The parts guessed: Willem being beaten by the skinheads; Allyson fleeing back to London in misery. They share the frustration of never finding out each other\u2019s true names, their whole names, email addresses. They remedy that. (Willem Shiloh De Ruiter. Allyson Leigh Healey, etc. etc.) Allyson tells Willem about the letter she wrote him last March, when she finally allowed herself to wonder if maybe the worst hadn\u2019t happened, if maybe Willem hadn\u2019t abandoned her.</p><p>Willem tells Allyson about only just finding out about the letter\u2019s existence last month, trying to track it down, and only yesterday finding out what it said.</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Allyson asks. \u201cI got the letter back four days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it back?\u201d Willem asks. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I went to your house. Your old house, in Utrecht.\u201d</p><p>Broodje\u2019s place, on Bloemstraat, where he\u2019d spent the dark days following his return from Paris, healing from the beating, from everything, really.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know to go there?\u201d he asks. \u201cTo Bloemstraat.\u201d He hadn\u2019t lived there when they\u2019d met, and he hadn\u2019t given her any contact information. This was something he had regretted.</p><p>Allyson is embarrassed now, at the lengths she went through to find him. She doesn\u2019t regret going through them, but she understands how overzealous it might look. In her discomfort, she starts to pull her feet away. But Willem won\u2019t let her. He holds them fast. And this small gesture gives her the courage to tell him. About venturing to Paris. About tracking down C\u00e9line. About going to the H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis. About Dr. Robinet and his kindness. The address, which led her back to the house in Utrecht. And to the letter.</p><p>\u201cI kept the letter. I actually have it in my backpack.\u201d</p><p>She leans over and pulls out a creased envelope. She hands it to Willem. There are generations of addresses here. Tor\u2019s house in Leeds, the original Guerilla Will headquarters (how had she found that?), forwarded to Willem\u2019s former houseboat in Amsterdam, since sold, and forwarded on to Bloemstraat.</p><p>\u201cYou can read it if you want,\u201d Allyson offers.</p><p>\u201cSeems beyond the point,\u201d Willem says. Though that isn\u2019t why he doesn\u2019t want to read it. Tor had instructed someone to email him and tell him what the letter said. He doesn\u2019t have the stomach to read the whole letter in front of Allyson.</p><p>But Allyson takes the envelope back, unfolds the letter inside of it, and hands it to him.</p><p>Dear Willem:</p><p>I\u2019ve been trying to forget about you and our day in Paris for nine months now, but as you can see, it\u2019s not going all that well. I guess more than anything, I want to know, did you just leave? If you did, it\u2019s okay. I mean it\u2019s not, but if I can know the truth, I can get over it. And if you didn\u2019t leave, I don\u2019t know what to say. Except I\u2019m sorry that I did.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what your response will be at getting this letter, like a ghost from your past. But no matter what happened, I hope you\u2019re okay.</p><p>The letter is not what he thought it would be. Not what Tor suggested it was. It takes Willem a moment to find his voice again, and when he does, he speaks to the Allyson who wrote the letter as much as to the girl sitting here. \u201cI didn\u2019t just leave,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t forget. And I wasn\u2019t okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that now,\u201d she says. \u201cI think part of me knew it then, too but I wasn\u2019t brave enough to believe it. I was okay that day but I wasn\u2019t okay generally. I am now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Willem folds the letter, carefully, like it is sacred text. \u201cI am, too.\u201d</p><p>He hands the letter back to Allyson. She shakes her head. \u201cI wrote it to you.\u201d</p><p>He knows exactly where he will keep it. With the photo of him and Yael and Bram from his eighteenth birthday. With the photo of Saba and Saba\u2019s sister, Willem\u2019s great aunt Olga, who, like this letter, he only recently discovered had existed. This letter from Allyson will join the important things, thought lost, now found.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand,\u201d Willem says. \u201cI went to the house on Bloemstraat last month and the letter wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d Allyson says. \u201cSaskia and Anamiek never mentioned seeing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d Willem asks.</p><p>\u201cThey live there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh. Well, I didn\u2019t meet them. I let myself in with my key.\u201d</p><p>Allyson laughs. \u201cThat explains it. They didn\u2019t know you, either, though they knew of you. And also . . .\u201d She pauses and then forces herself to finish. \u201cAna Lucia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAna Lucia?\u201d Willem asks. He has not thought much about her since their spectacular blowout before Christmas last year. \u201cWhat about Ana Lucia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou met Ana Lucia?\u201d</p><p>Allyson remembers the girl\u2019s fury. Another student at Ana Lucia\u2019s college had told Allyson that Willem had been cheating on Ana Lucia with a French girl all along. When she\u2019d heard that, it had seemed to confirm everything bad Allyson suspected about him.</p><p>\u201cHow did that go? Willem asks.</p><p>\u201cWell, she didn\u2019t punch me.\u201d</p> <p>Willem winces. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t so happy to see you,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get it. I\u2019d never even met her before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have. A bit.\u201d</p><p>Allyson shakes her head. \u201cNo. I think I\u2019d remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Paris. In the Latin Quarter.\u201d</p><p>Allyson\u2019s mind spins and lands on the carousel of postcards that she had pretended to look at while Willem chatted with some girls he\u2019d known from home. Ana Lucia was one of them?</p><p>\u201cBut why would she hate me?\u201d Allyson asks, remembering her own jealousy at any girl Willem seemed vaguely interested in. But jealousy was one thing. Ana Lucia had literally thrown Allyson out of her dorm room.</p><p>\u201cBecause she caught me buying the airplane tickets to find you.\u201d</p> <p>Airplane tickets? Find me where? Allyson mind scrambles to incorporate this new information. It still doesn\u2019t make sense. Willem had gone to Spain to meet the French girl he\u2019d been cheating on Ana Lucia with. Allyson had suspected it was C\u00e9line, even though C\u00e9line had told Allyson she had not seen Willem since the day he was with Allyson in Paris. At the time, Allyson had believed her.</p><p>And just like that, Allyson understands it. How jealousy contorts things. She thinks of C\u00e9line, how jealous she had been of her, and how wrong about her. She was Ana Lucia\u2019s C\u00e9line.</p><p>There was no French girl. There was an American girl he met in France.</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t go to Spain?\u201d Allyson asks.</p><p>\u201cSpain?\u201d Willem says. \u201cNo. I went to Mexico.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The more questions are answered, the more are asked. But now Willem has to leave to meet Petra and Linus. Neither Allyson nor Willem wants to part. For now, they wish they could both stay like this, talking.</p><p>He would like to bring her with him now, to put her in his pocket. Except he must face Petra, his cantankerous director, who he knows is furious with him about last night\u2019s performance. He ignored her direction to play the part safe, to play it as Jeroen had played it. Instead, he had done what his friend Kate had suggested. He\u2019d done it his way, found his own Orlando and in doing so, opened up a vein of himself on that stage. It had been the most exhilarating experience of his life. Well, until the knock at the door today.</p><p>Much as he would like to keep Allyson close by, he knows it is unwise to parade her in front of Petra. Though he cannot wait to introduce her to Kate. He will introduce her to Kate tonight. And Broodje. And W and Henk and Max. All the people who led him back to her.</p><p>\u201cI am in trouble with the director,\u201d Willem explains. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s better if we meet later.\u201d</p><p>There is something then that hangs between them. Meeting later is what got them into this predicament in the first place. Willem stepping out for a bit. Accidents happening. And a year before they found each other again.</p><p>They both seem to recognize the moment. But they also know now is not then. And as if to prove it, Willem slides a key off a ring and gives it to Allyson. She stares at it in her palm. So does he.</p><p>A year ago I had a backpack, and now I have a key, he thinks.</p><p>A year ago we didn\u2019t give each other our names, and now he gave me a key, she thinks.</p><p>(Also, Willem has just glanced at the birthmark on Allyson\u2019s wrist, giving himself an urgent desire to taste it again. Between her feet and her wrist, he is having a hard time getting out the door.)</p><p>(Speaking of feet, Allyson is looking at the zigzag scar on Willem\u2019s foot\u2014left foot\u2014and remembering she wanted to find out how he got it. Along with his birthday and his favorite ice cream flavor and ten thousand other things there don\u2019t seem to be enough time for.)</p><p>So for now Willem tells her to make herself at home. Eat what is in the kitchen. Use the computer. There is WiFi. Skype. Have a rest. His bedroom is the yellow one. He likes to picture her in his flat.</p><p>\u201cHere is my cellphone number,\u201d he tells her. He writes it on a pad. He resists the urge to write it on her arm, to tattoo it there.</p><p>He is about to leave, but stops in the doorway. They are now mirror images of how they were a few hours ago, Willem in the flat, Allyson in the hall. Neither is sure what this means.</p><p>What they are sure is that they want to kiss. Both of them do. There is a pull, it feels almost like a chain, linking them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back here at six,\u201d Willem promises.</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d she repeats. It\u2019s after four now. She has officially missed her flight to Croatia.</p><p>He starts to close the door behind him. Then opens it again. \u201cYou\u2019ll be here?\u201d He is nervous now about leaving. He can\u2019t help it. The mirror images. The Universal Law of Equilibrium. Last year, he vanished. This year, it could be her.</p><p>Except he thinks he has stopped believing in this universal register of deposits and debits, of good things coming at a cost. And when Allyson closes the door, promising that she will be there, he allows himself to believe it.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>There is news to share. They each share it.</p><p>Willem, in a rush, texts Kate, whom he just saw a few hours ago when she was on her way to meet her fianc\u00e9 at the airport. She was bringing him to meet Willem so Willem could get his seal of approval to join their theater group.</p><p>I have big news, he writes. I\u2019m Orlando tonight.</p><p>He writes a version of the same to Broodje, who, along with Henk is helping W move into a new flat with his girlfriend, Lien. He knows all of them will get the message and all of them will come, even though they all came last night, because that is how his friends are.</p><p>He is riding his bike to the theater when he realizes that they will all think the big news is that he was given one more chance to do Orlando. Though in reality, he was fired. He is going on tonight out of necessity. He can almost taste Petra\u2019s disgust at having to put him back on the stage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That isn\u2019t the news. The news is Lulu, of course. Allyson. But tonight, they will all come. And they will find out.</p><p>Then he thinks of Yael. His mother, so far away from him these past few years, until that day in Paris last year that set everything in motion. It\u2019s the middle of the night in Mumbai, so Willem texts her.</p><p>I found her. He stops. Maybe it is more accurate to say she found him. But that is not what he is feeling. He is feeling that he found her. So that is what he writes.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t elaborate. He knows his mother will understand.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Back in Willem\u2019s flat, Allyson has texted Wren. CALL ME ASAP!!! And then she decides to be nosy. Not to snoop exactly, but to look around.</p><p>The living room does not offer clues. Even had Allyson not been told this apartment belonged to Willem\u2019s uncle, she would\u2019ve been able to tell it was not Willem\u2019s. She goes into the bedroom in the back. The yellow one. The bed is unmade, and it smells of Willem. Somehow she knows this.</p><p>She feels shy, tentative, as if she is invading. But she remembers Willem telling her, exhorting her, as much as someone as Willem exhorts, to make herself at home. The key to the flat is still in her pocket.</p><p>She sits down on the bed. It\u2019s low to the ground, the view looking up out the window. There\u2019s a small bookshelf. She smiles when she sees a copy of Twelfth Night there. She leafs through it, remembering how she avoided reading it in her Shakespeare Out Loud class. She thinks of Dee. She hasn\u2019t talked with him since Paris. She calculates the time difference. It\u2019s a little past 8:00 a.m. in New York. Maybe she can Skype him.</p> <p>The laptop is on the bookshelf. When she takes it, she accidentally knocks over a large envelope. Out spill several photographs, newspaper clippings, some of them very old. There\u2019s also a picture of Willem, a younger Willem, his face slightly less chiseled, but still Willem. He is flanked by a man and a woman. The woman is small, dark, intense, and the man is her opposite, all tall golden smiles. These must be Yael and Bram.</p><p>She feels a little as if she knows them. And sorry she never did.</p><p>She carefully puts the photographs back in the envelope and puts the envelope in a safe corner of the bookshelf. That is when she hears the sound, instantly familiar. It takes her a moment to locate it, inside the pocket of the jacket she saw Willem wearing after the play last night.</p><p>She pulls it out. Her old gold watch, last year\u2019s high-school graduation gift. She\u2019d hated it, so heavy and perfect, but it\u2019s kind of endearing now, all scuffed up, the face of it cracked. She turns it over. The GOING PLACES engraving had seemed so burdensome when her mother had given it to her, but now it seems kind of prophetic, like the most perfect thing to have wished for her. She wants to tell her mother about this revelation and stops for a moment to savor that, wanting to tell her mother something.</p><p>That said, she doesn\u2019t want the watch back.</p><p>In that Paris park, she\u2019d given it to Willem, given time to him, and in exchange she became the girl in the Double Happiness story. His mountain girl, he\u2019d called her.</p> <p>She\u2019d known he kept the watch. C\u00e9line had told her as much when she\u2019d confronted her in Paris last week. But she\u2019d made it sound as though Willem had kept it to pawn it. But he\u2019d kept it to keep. To keep her.</p><p>Allyson holds the watch in her hand. She feels the vibration of its ticking and is full in a way she can\u2019t really explain.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Willem is trying hard not to laugh.</p><p>Petra is berating him, telling him he made a mockery of the company last night. This might be true, but Willem also knows the performance was a triumph. Which is perhaps the real mockery. But he lets Petra give him all her notes. Tell him all the beats he got wrong, how he mangled the language, how he confused the audience.</p><p>\u201cTonight you will play the part as Jeroen plays it, as an understudy must play it,\u201d she commands. It is the same direction she\u2019d given him yesterday, when he was called up to step in for Jeroen after the lead actor broke his ankle. It was the direction that had almost derailed him, until Kate had persuaded him to take the risk. \u201cGo big or go home\u201d was how Kate put it. But Willem had come to understand it as \u201cGo big and go home.\u201d That\u2019s how it had felt. Last night he had thought the going home was to acting, to a new home in New York City, to an apprenticeship with Ruckus Theater Company, which Kate runs with her fianc\u00e9. But today it feels as though home has come to him.</p><p>\u201cAre we clear?\u201d Petra asks after she has smoked her way through two cigarettes worth of criticisms. \u201cYou will do as your director tells you.\u201d</p><p>He would do as his director told him, but Kate was his director now. \u201cI will perform the role as I did last night,\u201d he tells Petra.</p> <p>Petra\u2019s face goes purple. It doesn\u2019t bother Willem one bit. What can she do? Fire him?</p><p>She stomps her feet. She seems like a little girl denied her dessert. He tries to keep a straight face, tries not to laugh, tries not to notice that Linus appears to be holding in a chuckle of his own.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Dee is laughing, too.</p><p>At the story his girl has just finished telling him. It\u2019s almost too crazy to believe, which is how you know it\u2019s true.</p><p>\u201cToo bad Shakespeare\u2019s dead,\u201d Dee tells Allyson. \u201cBecause that\u2019s a story he\u2019d wanna steal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d Allyson says.</p><p>Dee\u2019s mama drops a cup of coffee onto the desk. He can smell bacon frying in the kitchen. \u201cThat our girl?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Dee isn\u2019t sure when Allyson went from being his girl to their girl, but he opens the screen so his mama can say hello, too.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby,\u201d she says. \u201cHow you doin\u2019? \u201cWant some waffles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mrs. D\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s warning face travels four thousand miles in a split second.</p><p>\u201cI mean, Sandra,\u201d Allyson corrects. \u201cI\u2019d love some. Not sure you can Skype food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome day, I wouldn\u2019t put it past them,\u201d she says.</p><p>Dee angles the computer away. \u201cMama, I haven\u2019t talked to my girl in a week. You can have her when she comes home.\u201d Dee turns back to the screen. \u201cAm I still picking you up at the airport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can. I think my mom was going to drive down, too. She said you could come back with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s this party starting,?\u201d Dee asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meant to be flying home tomorrow afternoon. I\u2019m actually meant to be in Croatia right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a lotta \u2018meant to\u2019 going on,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Allyson laughs. \u201cTruth is I don\u2019t have a clue what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>She might not have a clue but Dee knows the signs and symptoms of a girl in love. She\u2019s practically glowing, and without the benefit of the cucumber-and-yogurt facial he has planned as part of his welcome-home pampering spa day. He\u2019s got a whole list of activities, but mostly he just wants to sit in the same room and talk. He misses her. Dee didn\u2019t know you could miss a friend as much as he\u2019s missed Allyson this summer, but then again, he\u2019s never had a friend like her.</p><p>\u201cYou never did have a clue. At least now you\u2019re owning your ignorance,\u201d Dee teases.</p><p>\u201cYou know me so well!\u201d Allyson jokes, but she touches her hand to the camera so it appears on the screen and Dee knows she\u2019s not joking, not really. He reciprocates by putting his hand on her screen. They let the gesture say the unspoken things: Thank you for getting me here. Thank you for understanding me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d Allyson says.</p><p>It\u2019s just what Dee needs to hear. \u201cI miss you, too, baby.\u201d</p><p>Mama swoops back behind him, forcing herself back into the screen. She blows Allyson kisses. \u201cHe does. My boy is pining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him, too.\u201d</p> <p>Sandra sticks her head right in front of the camera. \u201cHow\u2019s that map working out?\u201d</p><p>She had bought Allyson a laminated map of Paris as a bon voyage present. The gesture had embarrassed Dee at first, along with the bon voyage party his mama had insisted on throwing for Allyson, even though she\u2019d never met her. \u201cFeels more like what you\u2019re really doin\u2019 is throwing me a hooray-you-finally-done-made-a-friend party,\u201d Dee had said. His mama had raised one formidable eyebrow and retorted, \u201cAnd why can\u2019t I do both?\u201d (Dee lost the argument. The party had been delightful.)</p><p>\u201cMama, she ain\u2019t in Paris anymore. She\u2019s in Amster\u2014\u201d Dee starts to say.</p><p>But Allyson cuts him off. \u201cThe map was perfect,\u201d she says. She explains how the map had given her the idea to check the Paris hospitals, which had led her to Wren and to Dr. Robinet and to the house on Bloemstraat and now here. \u201cSo you see, I wouldn\u2019t have found my way here without it.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Broodje is shattered. He was up most of the night drinking, celebrating Willem\u2019s debut as Orlando. He woke up after three hours of sleep with a Queen\u2019s-Day-level hangover, only to remember he and Henk had promised W they\u2019d help him move.</p><p>They\u2019d spent the day lugging boxes up four flights of steep stairs. (W would have to be moving into the top-floor flat. Broodje had remarked that if they weren\u2019t hungover, the flat would\u2019ve been garden level. W spent fifteen long minutes poking holes in the logic of such a statement.)</p><p>Now Broodje is back at his flat. Not his, exactly. His for the next two weeks until he moves back to Utrecht with Henk. He doesn\u2019t really want to go to Willy\u2019s show again tonight, but he will because it\u2019s Willy. At least he has a few hours free to rest. All he wants to do is take off his dusty, sweaty clothes and climb into bed.</p><p>He is already pulling off his shirt when he walks in the door.</p><p>And then he screams.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit, sorry,\u201d he says, putting the shirt back on. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Willy had company.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a bit of a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu this, walking in on one of Willy\u2019s girls. It used to be like this all the time. But not for a while. Not for a really long while.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d the girl says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone was coming.\u201d</p><p>Then Broodje looks at the girl for a longer moment. \u201cWait, I know you. You were at the play last night. In the park.\u201d He\u2019d invited her and her friend to come to the party. He\u2019d talked more to the friend, who was very cute, though he still missed Candace, his sort-of girlfriend, but she lived in America so they were trying to figure things out. When did Willy hook up with the friend?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Broodje,\u201d the girl says.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d Broodje says. He is tired and hungover and his muscles ache and he doesn\u2019t want to entertain one of Willy\u2019s girls. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Allyson,\u201d she says. Then she seems to reconsider. \u201cBut you might know me as Lulu.\u201d</p><p>Broodje looks at her for a minute. And then he tackles her in a hug.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>When Willem comes home, he finds his best friend and the girl his best friend tried to help him track down sitting together, eating. Broodje has emptied the kitchen, it seems: cheese, crackers, sausage, herring, beer. He is feeding Allyson, which is what Broodje does with people he loves. Willem sees Allyson has received a fast pass to his best friend\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cWilly!\u201d Broodje calls. \u201cWe were just talking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d Willem says. He steps forward and his instinct is to kiss Allyson. He does not want to enter or leave a room without kissing her. This, too, is something new. But he doesn\u2019t because this is all so new, even though the way Broodje and Allyson are sitting there, smearing cheese on crackers, it seems like they\u2019ve been doing this for decades.</p><p>\u201cI was telling Lulu, sorry, Allyson, what a sad sack you\u2019ve been all year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all year,\u201d Willem says. (Though, really, it was almost all year.)</p><p>\u201cOkay. Maybe not in India. I wasn\u2019t with you in India. He went to India for three months to see his ma,\u201d Broodje explains to Allyson. \u201cHe was in a movie over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you famous in India?\u201d Allyson asks.</p><p>\u201cI am Brad Pitt in India,\u201d Willem says.</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe not since he came back. But shit, after he got back from Paris, he was a mess. And in Mexico, when he couldn\u2019t find you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Broodje,\u201d Willem says. \u201cNo need to give away all the family secrets.\u201d</p><p>Broodje rolls his eyes. \u201cFar as I\u2019m concerned, she\u2019s family now.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Speaking of family, Allyson loves watching Willem with Broodje. Not that she needs reassuring exactly, but seeing him with Broodje is reassuring.</p><p>\u201cI was going to take you out to eat,\u201d Willem says to her. \u201cBut Broodje beat me to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can still go if you want,\u201d Allyson says.</p><p>\u201cI have to be at the theater in less than an hour,\u201d Willem says. \u201cWe can go out after? Just us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just you,\u201d Broodje says. \u201cW, Henk, Lien, they\u2019re all coming. And they will all want to meet her.\u201d He nods to Allyson. \u201cYou are like the business we all invested in and now you\u2019re paying off so . . . you can be alone later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWren called, too. The friend I was in Amsterdam with\u201d Allyson says. \u201cShe wants to meet up.\u201d</p><p>And, Willem thinks, there would also be Kate and her fianc\u00e9.</p><p>Allyson and Willem look at each other, the invisible chain connecting them pulling hard. Why hadn\u2019t they taken more advantage of those quiet hours this afternoon? Why had they just sat there, her feet in his lap, when there was a perfectly good empty apartment here?</p><p>Except Allyson wouldn\u2019t have exchanged those hours with Willem for anything in the world.</p><p>And neither would Willem.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>All too quickly, they part again. Willem will go ahead to his call at the theater. Wren is meeting Allyson and Broodje at the flat. Everyone will meet at the park, and after the play, they will all celebrate.</p><p>Saying good-bye is less fraught this time. They have done it now once, like normal people: leave, come back. It builds confidence.</p><p>This time Willem kisses her good-bye. It is quick, a peck on the lips. It is not nearly enough. He wants all of her. From her lips to her feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you after the play,\u201d Allyson says.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Willem says.</p><p>But they both know they will see each other sooner than that. That they will find each other during the play, once more, in the words of Shakespeare.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Wren arrives not long after Willem has left. She squeals and hugs Allyson, squeals and hugs Broodje. She kisses the saints on her bracelet. Jude, patron saint of lost causes. Anthony, patron saint of lost things. She kisses all the saints. They all came through. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Wren says in that fluty voice of hers. \u201cBut I thought you were going to find him on the train, like you did the last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sort of found him at the train station,\u201d Allyson says. And then she explains how she\u2019d been about to catch the train to the airport when she\u2019d opened the packed breakfast Winston, the guy from their hotel, had made for her. And it was the hagelslag that did it. The bread with chocolate sprinkles, the very first thing she and Willem had talked about. It had been the sign, the accident, the nudge to go to Willem.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know where to find him?\u201d Wren asks</p><p>\u201cBecause you told me the address, and that the name of the street was a belt.\u201d</p> <p>Wren turns to Broodje. \u201cYou told me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForeigners can never remember Ceintuurbaan otherwise,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to the many other pronounceable street names here?\u201d Allyson asks.</p><p>They all laugh.</p><p>They clean up the mess from the snacks and prepare to make their way to Vondelpark. Somewhere in the back of her mind, Allyson knows she has a flight home out of London tomorrow, at 4:00. She will have to figure out how to get there. She has a few hundred dollars left. If she has to blow it on the fast Eurostar train, so be it. It was a last-minute impromptu decision to go to Paris from London that had gotten this entire ball rolling. It took two hours to get from one world to another. She is fairly confident she\u2019ll be able to get back in time.</p> <p>When Broodje goes to have a quick shower, Wren pats the sofa next to her. \u201cDid you find out who the woman was, the one with the flowers from last night?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Allyson hasn\u2019t. Last night, seeing Willem with the woman had been a deal breaker. It had seemed to confirm everything she suspected about him, the way that Ana Lucia\u2019s fury had. But now Allyson doesn\u2019t really care who that woman is. She has seen Willem. She has spent an afternoon with him. She knows that what happened to her last year, in a way, has happened to him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she tells Wren.</p><p>\u201cYou could ask Broodje.\u201d</p><p>She could, but she doesn\u2019t want to. It no longer matters.</p><p>She can almost hear Melanie\u2019s scoff from across the Atlantic. Melanie had been with Allyson last summer when she\u2019d met Willem, had been suspicious of him from the start, had not been able to understand why Allyson wouldn\u2019t let go of that one guy, that one day.</p> <p>Whatever. She isn\u2019t listening to Melanie. Or her mom. Or Dee. Or C\u00e9line. Or Ana Lucia. She is listening to herself. And she knows that everything is okay.</p><p>\u201cYou know what we should do?\u201d Wren says, that manic mischievous smile of hers spreading across her face. \u201cWe should get him flowers.\u201d</p><p>For a second Allyson thinks this is some sort of duel, to win against the red-haired woman from last night. But then she understands what Wren means. They should get him flowers. At the flower market. Where Wolfgang works.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>They ride on Wren\u2019s bicycle, Allyson sidesaddle on the rack behind. (She thinks this might be her favorite thing about Amsterdam. She wants to import the tandem sidesaddle riding back home.) It is early evening when they arrive at the flower market, but a Saturday night, and bustling. Wolfgang is there, wrapping up a big bouquet of lilies.</p><p>When he looks up and sees them, he doesn\u2019t seem the slightest bit surprised, even though Allyson is supposed to be in Croatia. He just winks. Allyson waits for the crowd to disperse and when there\u2019s a break, she hugs him. The smell of him, tobacco and flowers, feels so good and familiar that it doesn\u2019t make sense that she only met Wolfgang three days ago (except that it does).</p><p>\u201cShe found him!\u201d Wren announces. \u201cShe found her Orlando.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was under the impression she found what she was looking for already last night,\u201d he says in that rumbly heavily accented voice.</p> <p>Wolfgang looks at Allyson, a silent understanding passing between them. He is right. Last night, even when she\u2019d thought Willem was a ghost she\u2019d been chasing, she still felt like she\u2019d found what she\u2019d been looking for. Something harder to lose. Because it was connected to her. Because it was her.</p><p>\u201cIt turns out, I found us both,\u201d Allyson tells Wolfgang.</p><p>\u201cDouble good news then,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cDouble happiness,\u201d Allyson says.</p><p>\u201cThat too,\u201d Wolfgang says.</p><p>\u201cWe are going to see him perform Orlando again. Can you come?\u201d Wren asks.</p><p>Wolfgang says that one night of Shakespeare is enough for him. And he has to shut down the stall tonight. But he\u2019ll be free after ten.</p><p>\u201cThen meet us after,\u201d Allyson says. \u201cA bunch of us are going for dinner. You should be there.\u201d</p><p>She thinks of what Broodje said, the dinner like a banquet for the investor\u2019s circle. Wolfgang should be there. So should Dee. And Professor Glenny. And Babs. And Kali and Jenn, her roommates last year. Maybe she\u2019ll hold another investor\u2019s dinner when she goes home.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it,\u201d Wolfgang says. \u201cNow, would you like some flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>At the amphitheater at Vondelpark, Allyson spots Broodje. He has saved several seats, up front this time. He is with a group of people, a guy even taller than Willem, a short-haired girl, another guy. He has brought a basket of food and several bottles of beer.</p><p>He kisses Allyson and Wren three times, cheek-cheek-cheek. And then he turns to the group. \u201cEveryone. This is her. Lulu. Only she\u2019s really Allyson. And this is her friend Wren.\u201d</p><p>They all sort of stare at each other. The girl speaks first, sticking out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Lien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllyson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWren.\u201d</p><p>Lien stares at her. \u201cYou really do look like Louise Brooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wren says.</p><p>\u201cThe silent film actress,\u201d Allyson explains. \u201cMy hair was like hers then. That\u2019s why Willem called me Lulu.\u201d</p><p>Lien looks at her, remembering that Louise Brooks movie Willem dragged them all to. She\u2019d known then something was up with Willem. No one had believed her when she\u2019d said he had fallen in love.</p><p>They believe her now.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>W is having a hard time understanding.</p><p>After all the methodical work they put into it, calling all the American tour companies, finding the barge captain in Deauville, the charts of all the connections, this didn\u2019t make sense. Willem going off to Mexico to look for her hadn\u2019t made sense either. It would\u2019ve been one thing had the girl visited a small town during a quiet time of year, but a resort area at Christmas? The odds were ridiculous. But at least that adhered to a logic. The Principle of Connectivity, albeit stretched very thin.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t understand this. All the looking they had done, and from what Broodje had said, the girl had done her own looking. But then she\u2019d just happened upon him at the play last night? The play Willem was not even meant to be performing in? He\u2019d been the understudy until last night.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t make sense. It doesn\u2019t make any sense at all.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Backstage, Willem is thinking about accidents again. And things that seemingly don\u2019t make sense, except they do. Like right out there in the fifth row. All of them, together. That makes sense.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t see Kate yet, but she has texted that she and David will be there but must leave right after the play. David is catching a late flight back to London, and she\u2019s seeing him to the airport. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Willem\u2019s cast mates slap him on the back, offer congratulations from last night, and condolences for next week. He accepts them both.</p><p>Max is by his side, as always. She is the other understudy, for Rosalind, and Willem\u2019s best friend in the cast. \u201cYou win some, you lose some. And sometimes you win and lose at the same time. Life\u2019s a bloody cockup,\u201d Max says.</p><p>\u201cIs that Shakespeare?\u201d Willem asks.</p><p>\u201cNah. Just me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds like the Universal Law of Equilibrium,\u201d Willem says.</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>When Willem doesn\u2019t answer right away, she says, \u201cSounds like a bunch of shite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d Willem agrees. And then he asks her if she\u2019ll come out after the show.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still hungover from last night,\u201d Max complains. \u201cHow many parties does one man need?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is different,\u201d Willem says.</p><p>\u201cHow is it different?\u201d Max asks.</p><p>Max has become one of his closest friends these past months, and yet he hasn\u2019t told her a thing. There is nothing to do now but to tell her everything.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m in love.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Kate and David arrive just before curtain. She\u2019d meant to come straight from the airport, but when she\u2019d seen David, she had been overcome. It was a bit silly, really. It had only been a few days since she\u2019d seen him, and they\u2019d been together for five years. But she\u2019d been feeling roiled since last night. A good Shakespearean performance was known to have aphrodisiacal effects. So when David arrived, she\u2019d hustled him back to her Major Booger hotel and had her way with him. Then they\u2019d fallen asleep and gotten themselves massively lost on the way to the park (someone should mention to city planners that Amsterdam was laid out like a rat\u2019s maze, albeit a very pretty rat\u2019s maze) and now here they are.</p> <p>I hope I haven\u2019t oversold it, Kate thinks as the lights go down. She has essentially promised Willem an apprenticeship based on last night\u2019s performance, but David has to agree. She is sure David will agree. Willem had been that good. But she is nervous now. They\u2019ve offered apprenticeships to foreigners before, but sparingly, because the visa paperwork and union issues are such a headache.</p><p>Willem enters the stage. \u201cAs I remember . . .\u201d he begins as Orlando.</p><p>Kate breathes a sigh of relief. She hasn\u2019t oversold it.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It is better than last night. Because there are no walls. No illusions. This time, they know exactly who they are speaking to.</p><p>\u201cThe little strength that I have, I would it were with you\u201d.</p><p>She is his Mountain Girl.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?\u201d</p> <p>No more pretending. Because he knows. She knows.</p><p>\u201cFair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.\u201d</p><p>She believes. They both do.</p><p>\u201cI would kiss before I spoke.\u201d</p><p>The line is a kiss. Their kiss.</p><p>\u201cFor ever and a day.\u201d</p><p>For ever and a day.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d David says to Kate when it is over.</p><p>Kate thinks I told you so, but doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is the hitchhiker you gave a ride to in Mexico?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep telling you, he wasn\u2019t a hitchhiker.\u201d David has been giving her grief about giving a ride to a stranger for months now. Kate keeps reminding him that all people are strangers, initially. \u201cEven you were a stranger to me once,\u201d she\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if he was three-legged ape,\u201d David says now. \u201cHe\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>Kate smiles. She loves lots of things, but she especially loves to be right.</p><p>\u201cAnd he wants to apprentice with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Kate says.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t keep him off a stage for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He\u2019s green. The training will do him good. And then we can sort out union issues and get him up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really Dutch?\u201d David asks. \u201cHe has no accent.\u201d He stops for a second. \u201cListen to that. They\u2019re still applauding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d Kate teases.</p><p>\u201cShould I be?\u201d David teases back.</p><p>\u201cThat boy is hopelessly in love with some American girl he found and lost in Paris. As for me, I\u2019m hopelessly in love with some stranger I met five years ago.\u201d</p><p>David kisses her.</p><p>\u201cDo you really have to go back tonight?\u201d Kate asks. \u201cYou could come out after with Willem really quickly and then we could give the squeaky bed at the Major Booger another go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one?\u201d David asks.</p><p>They kiss again. The audience is still applauding.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Allyson notices the kissing couple. It\u2019s hard not to, because people are starting to meander out of the theater and they are still kissing. And because, much as she\u2019s looking forward to getting to know Willem\u2019s friends, what she really wants to do is what that couple is doing.</p><p>And then the couple breaks apart, and Allyson gasps. The woman! She\u2019s the woman from last night. The one she\u2019d seen Willem with. The one she\u2019d thought he was in love with. As of this afternoon, she no longer thought that. And now she really doesn\u2019t think that.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d Allyson asks Broodje, pointing to the woman.</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d Broodje says. Then he points to the stage door. \u201cLook, here comes Willy.\u201d</p><p>Allyson feels paralyzed all of a sudden. Last night, she\u2019d stood at that very stage door and Willem had breezed right by her, into the arms of that other woman. The one who is now in the arms of that other man.</p><p>This is not last night. This is tonight. And Willem is walking right toward her. And he is smiling. Wren thrusts the bouquet Wolfgang prepared (an enormous bouquet; it almost capsized the bike on the ride to the park) into her arms.</p><p>The bouquet is smashed in about five seconds. Because Willem doesn\u2019t seem to give a shit about the flowers or the crowd of people waiting for him. He seems to be heeding Orlando\u2019s words tonight.</p><p>\u201cI would kiss before I spoke.\u201d</p><p>And for the second time in a day, he does.</p><p>And, oh, what a kiss. It makes the one this morning seem chaste. It makes the flowers smashed between them bloom all at once. Allyson could live in that kiss.</p><p>Except she hears laughter behind them. And a voice, an unfamiliar one, though Allyson knows at once that it belongs to the redhead.</p><p>\u201cI take it you found her then,\u201d the voice says.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It takes ages for them all to troop out of the park. There are so many of them: Willem, Allyson, Broodje, Henk, W, Lien, Max, Kate, David. Wolfgang and Winston, the guy from the hotel whom Wren has been spending time with, are joining them later. The logistics are complicated. This one left a bike back there. This one is meeting them over here.</p><p>But it\u2019s the introductions that take longer.</p><p>Kate is a theater director. Whom Willem met in Mexico, while he was looking for Allyson.</p><p>David is her fianc\u00e9, whom Willem has never met, who is going on about how good Willem was tonight, the vulnerability he brought to Orlando, what a brave way to play it.</p><p>Wren is the friend Allyson met in Paris and bumped into again in Amsterdam. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have found you if it weren\u2019t for her,\u201d Allyson tells Willem. \u201cI was about to give up but she made me go to the hospital you were at.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Willem thanks Wren.</p><p>Wren curtsies.</p><p>W listens to all the introductions and still doesn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Neither does Max. \u201cThis is too bloody confusing. Can someone draw a chart?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d W says.</p><p>\u201cI was kidding,\u201d Max says. \u201cWhat I really need is a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Wolfgang has arranged for a table at a caf\u00e9 run by a friend of his in a neighborhood off the shrinking red light district. It is on the Kloveniersburgwal, not far from the bookstore where Willem found the copy of Twelfth Night, and where the bookseller inside told him about the auditions for As You Like It that were happening at the theater around the way.</p><p>It takes about an hour for them to get there, because they all walk together, instead of splitting up into taxis and trams and onto bikes. No one wants to be separated. Something about the night feels magical, as if a bit of Shakespeare\u2019s fairy dust has settled over them.</p> <p>Wolfgang is waiting at the table, along with Winston, a pitcher of beer between them.</p><p>Everyone sits down. Allyson snaps a picture and texts it to Dee. Wish you were here.</p><p>She is about to put her phone away but then she texts the photo to her mother. I am having the best day of my life, she writes. She hesitates before hitting send. She is not entirely sure how welcome this message will be, from a bar, no less. But she thinks (hopes) her mother will be happy that she is so happy. And with that in mind, she presses send.</p><p>Wolfgang has ordered a bunch of food, pizza and pasta and salads. It starts to arrive, along with lots more booze.</p><p>Willem has hardly eaten all day and is famished. But Allyson is sitting next to him, and with everyone jammed at the table, she is right up close. And then she slips off her sandals under the table and sort of nuzzles her foot against his.</p><p>He loses his appetite, for food anyway.</p> <p>The conversation is disjointed. Everyone wants to tell their part of the tale, and they tell it out of order and, as the booze flows, with increased drunkenness.</p><p>Allyson and Willem sit back and listen to this story.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know her, but I knew I was supposed to go with her to the hospitals,\u201d Wren is saying.</p><p>\u201cI knew something was up as soon as Willem came back,\u201d Lien says.</p><p>\u201cHey, I did, too,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>\u201cNo you didn\u2019t,\u201d Henk says.</p><p>\u201cI did. I just didn\u2019t believe it was a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew something was up because he didn\u2019t want to shag Marina,\u201d Max says. She looks at Allyson. \u201cSorry, but have you seen Marina? Rosalind?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m biased because I\u2019d like to shag her.\u201d</p> <p>The table laughs.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to worry about,\u201d Kate tells Allyson. \u201cHe was a miserable mess in Mexico after he didn\u2019t find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was even worse after the food poisoning,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>\u201cYou got food poisoning?\u201d Kate asks. Willem nods. \u201cThe mystery meat? I knew it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got really sick right after you dropped me off,\u201d Willem says.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve called me,\u201d Kate says.</p><p>\u201cI ended up calling my ma, in India, and that\u2019s why I went over, so it was a good thing, the food poisoning.\u201d Sickness leading to healing. The truth and its opposite again.</p><p>\u201cAt least it paid off in the end, because at the time, that Mexico trip seemed like a disaster,\u201d Broodje says. \u201cAt that New Year\u2019s party, you were a mess, Willy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were. You had girls coming at you and you didn\u2019t want any of them. And then you lost your shoes.\u201d Broodje looks at the gathering. \u201cThere were these giant piles of shoes.\u201d</p><p>The hair on the back of Allyson\u2019s neck goes up. \u201cWait, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went to this party on the beach, in Mexico. New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the piles of shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Broodje says.</p><p>\u201cAnd the Spanish reggae band. Tabula rasa?\u201d Allyson asks.</p><p>It\u2019s noisy in the bar but it goes quiet for a second as Allyson and Willem look at each other and once again understand something that they somehow, somewhere already knew.</p><p>\u201cYou were there,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYou were there,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYou were both at the same party,\u201d W says. He shakes his head. \u201cI cannot even begin to calculate those odds.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been thinking of him. But it had felt like ridiculous wishful thinking. Delusional wishful thinking.</p><p>He\u2019d been thinking of her, too. In the water, he knew she was close, but not that close.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you were at that party!\u201d Henk says. \u201cI cannot believe you went all the way there and you didn\u2019t find each other.\u201d</p><p>Kate and Wolfgang have only just met. But for some reason, they catch each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they weren\u2019t ready to find each other,\u201d Wolfgang begins.</p><p>\u201cAnd so they didn\u2019t,\u201d Kate finishes.</p><p>\u201cThat makes no sense whatsoever,\u201d W says.</p><p>Except that even W\u2014mathematical, logical, analytical W\u2014somewhere understands that it does.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The night goes on. Pitchers of beer. Bottles of wine. The novelty of the Allyson-Willem hunt takes a backseat to more prosaic matters. Soccer. The weather. There is a debate about what Wren and Winston should do tomorrow. Allyson tries not to think about leaving tomorrow.</p><p>It\u2019s not that hard, because Willem\u2019s hand has snuck under the table where for the last hour, it has been playing lightly on the birthmark on her wrist. (Allyson never knew her wrist had so many nerve endings. Allyson\u2019s wrist has turned to jelly. Allyson can\u2019t really think of much except for Willem\u2019s hand, her wrist, except perhaps for the other places she\u2019d like his hand to go. Meanwhile, both her feet are now completely wrapped around his right ankle. She has no idea what that is doing to him.)</p><p>Wolfgang gets up to leave first. He has to work tomorrow, not so early, because it is Sunday, but early enough. He kisses Allyson good-bye. \u201cI have a sense I will see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Allyson has a feeling she\u2019s coming back to Amsterdam. She\u2019ll have to get a job on campus, pull double shifts at Caf\u00e9 Finlay during school breaks to afford the ticket. The thought of coming back makes her happy, but she can\u2019t really think about the year of not being here. So she doesn\u2019t. She just concentrates on her wrist, the little circles Willem is drawing, which are reverberating through her body in ever-growing waves, like when a pebble is tossed into a pond.</p><p>Kate and David, who have been doing their share of under-the-table canoodling, use Wolfgang\u2019s departure to make their own excuses. There are hasty kisses good-bye.</p><p>Before she leaves, Kate says to Willem: \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch on Monday. We\u2019ll have to start working on your visa paperwork right away, but we can get it expedited and probably have you out for October.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d David says.</p><p>Willem has known since yesterday, since before he even asked Kate if he could join up with Ruckus, that this was the right thing, that it would happen, but now with David\u2019s enthusiastic support, it has become very real.</p><p>\u201cWhat visa paperwork?\u201d W asks after Kate and David leave. Dutch nationals don\u2019t need visas for tourist trips to the States. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At that moment, Allyson snaps out of her wrist-related haze (maybe because Willem has stopped caressing her wrist).</p><p>Willem has not had time to tell anyone about his apprenticeship with Ruckus, not his friends whom he will leave behind, and not Allyson, for whom the move has different implications. Which is maybe why he feels so nervous now. He isn\u2019t sure how she might react. He doesn\u2019t want her to feel pressured, like the move means he has expectations. (He has hopes, of course, especially now that he knows how close she is to where he will be, but hopes are different from expectations.)</p><p>Willem doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s left them all hanging until Broodje says, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Willy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, nothing. No, not nothing. Something big, actually.\u201d The faces are expectant, even those of Wren and Winston, people he did not know of until tonight. \u201cKate and David run a theater company in New York City, and I\u2019m going to be an apprentice there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Henk asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll train with them, build sets, do whatever is needed, and eventually, perhaps, perform. It\u2019s a Shakespearean theater company.\u201d He looks at Allyson now. \u201cI forgot to tell you that.\u201d</p><p>He forgot to tell her everything. He was terrified to. He is terrified now. The ominous silence hanging over the table isn\u2019t helping. And Allyson having unraveled her feet from his ankle really isn\u2019t helping.</p><p>Maybe they aren\u2019t so in sync. Maybe what for him is good news, a reason to hope, is just too much too soon for her.</p><p>He vaguely hears people around the table offering congratulations.</p> <p>But he can\u2019t process it. He is looking at Allyson.</p><p>And Allyson is not congratulating him. She is crying.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Allyson sees Willem\u2019s face, his panic, and she knows he is misreading her. But she is helpless to explain right now. Words have left her. She is emotion only.</p><p>And it is too much. Not Willem moving to American, not Willem moving a bus ride away from her. It\u2019s that this happened at all. How it happened.</p><p>Allyson has to say something. Willem is looking so upset. The table is so quiet. The restaurant is quiet. It seems like all of Amsterdam is holding its breath for them.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re moving to New York?\u201d she says. She keeps it together for an entire sentence before her voice cracks and she dissolves into tears again.</p><p>It\u2019s Winston who gently touches Willem on the shoulder. \u201cMaybe you two should go now.\u201d</p><p>Willem and Allyson nod, dazed. They offer halfhearted farewells. (It doesn\u2019t matter; good-byes with these two aren\u2019t to be trusted anyhow) and leave amid promises from Wren to call in the morning and Broodje to crash at W and Lien\u2019s place tonight.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Silently, they walk to the bike racks outside in the narrow alleyway. Willem is desperately trying to think of something to say. He could tell her he doesn\u2019t have to go. Except he does have to go.</p><p>This isn\u2019t about her. It was catalyzed by her, and she\u2019s woven up in it, but this is ultimately about him and his life and what he needs to do to make himself whole. He\u2019s stopped drifting, he\u2019s stopped being tossed around by the wind.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t have to see her. It doesn\u2019t mean that. He\u2019d like it to mean that. But it doesn\u2019t have to.</p><p>Allyson is thinking about accidents again. Which aren\u2019t accidents at all. Allyson\u2019s grandma has a word for it: beshert. Meant to be. Allyson\u2019s grandma and Willem\u2019s saba could\u2019ve had entire conversations about beshert and kishkes.</p> <p>Except Allyson doesn\u2019t know about Saba (yet) or about kishkes (officially speaking, though she knows what they are and how to listen to them and she will never ever stop doing this). And she doesn\u2019t have the words to tell Willem what she needs to tell him.</p><p>So she doesn\u2019t use words. She licks her thumb and rubs it against her wrist.</p><p>Stained.</p><p>Willem grabs her wrist, rubs his own thumb against it. Does the same to his own wrist, just to make it clear.</p><p>Stained.</p><p>They slam into the wall then, kissing so intensely that Allyson levitates off the ground. (It feels like the kiss that is making her airborne, but really it is Willem\u2019s arms, which have grabbed Allyson\u2019s hips, though Willem can\u2019t even tell that he\u2019s lifting her because she feels weightless. Or like part of him.)</p><p>They kiss, mouths open, tears flowing, tongues licking. It is a devouring, consuming kiss. The kind of kiss that never comes off.</p><p>Willem\u2019s knees press between her skirt and he can feel the warmth under there, and things are about to get pretty crazy in this alleyway. Even for Amsterdam.</p><p>A cyclist passes by, ringing his bell, reminding them that they are actually outdoors, in public. Neither wants to stop. But there is an empty flat somewhere with a bed and somehow, while still kissing her, Willem manages to unlock his bike.</p><p>Allyson had thought riding sidesaddle with Wren was fun, but with Willem it is something else altogether. She remembers the illegal bike ride in Paris, when she sat in the seat and he pumped in front of her and how much she\u2019d wanted to touch him. She hadn\u2019t. She wouldn\u2019t. And then they\u2019d gotten pulled over by the police. But this, here, is perfectly legal. And there is a place for her to sit, and she can wrap her arms around his waist all she wants. She can nuzzle against his back and lick his vertebrae if she wants to. (She does, so she does.)</p><p>At the stoplights, she hops off the bike and he turns to her and they start kissing again and sometimes stay that way until the light turns green and cyclists and motos beep at them to get out of the way.</p><p>It is a torturously labored ride home like this. Allyson is desperate for it to end and would like for it to go on forever.</p><p>Willem is just desperate for it to end. He is so full of wanting that it is painful and Allyson keeps lifting his shirt and licking his back, which she shouldn\u2019t do while he\u2019s riding a bike because he might pass out. (But she shouldn\u2019t stop, either.)</p><p>And finally they are back outside his flat and he can barely keep his hands steady to lock his bike and he is about to attack her in the hall when he remembers condoms. He doesn\u2019t have any, hasn\u2019t needed any in months, so he drags her to a store that\u2019s still open and he buys a three pack.</p><p>\u201cGet the nine pack,\u201d Allyson says, and he almost explodes right there.</p><p>And then they are outside his building. And f**k because Mrs. Van der Meer is downstairs walking her dog and he doesn\u2019t want to make small talk with her, but they do and he introduces Allyson, and Mrs. Van der Meer wants to talk to her about her trip to California back in 1991 and Willem has to position Allyson in front of him because it is like being twelve-years-old again, the lack of self control he has, but also at least with Allyson standing in front of him, against him, it\u2019s bearable (and it is also unbearable).</p><p>Mrs. Van der Meer\u2019s dog yanks on the leash and she goes out and they go in and he can\u2019t even wait. They are on the stairs and she is under him and he\u2019s got that wrist of hers in his mouth (finally!) but it\u2019s not enough, he wants all of her (the feet!) and they both know they need to make it up to Daniel\u2019s flat but the last stretch is the hardest, but somehow they do and Willem can\u2019t find his key and at this point he is going to take her in the hall because he doesn\u2019t care, and honestly, neither does she, but then she remembers she has the key! He gave her the key. It\u2019s in her back pocket. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They don\u2019t even take the key out of the lock. They don\u2019t even make it off of the floor.</p><p>A year is a long time to wait.</p><p>And Allyson and Willem, they feel like they\u2019ve been waiting a lot longer.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Only later, after they have pulled the key out of the lock and put back on their clothes only to take them off again and try things more slowly this time and are having a 3 a.m. snack in Willem\u2019s bed, do things calm down enough for them to talk. They talk about things like birthdays and ice-cream flavors (March, August, chocolate for both) and scars (he fell on the deck of his family\u2019s houseboat, the one his father built; he has much to tell her about Bram). They speak of Willem\u2019s apprenticeship and Allyson\u2019s college. They spend a fair amount of time discussing the geography and transportation options of the American Northeast.</p><p>\u201cFour hours from New York to Boston on the bus,\u201d Allyson says. \u201cOne hour to Philadelphia on the train.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like trains,\u201d Willem says as he nibbles her ear. \u201cBusses, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I could come to Brooklyn on weekends,\u201d Allyson says shyly. Only not that shyly. Her hand is drifting down under the covers. Willem is glad she steered him away from the three pack. \u201cAnd October is like nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s practically tomorrow,\u201d Willem murmurs.</p> <p>\u201cI think today has become tomorrow.\u201d Allyson pauses. \u201cWhich means I\u2019m supposed to fly home today. I have to get myself to Heathrow in like ten hours. Is that even possible?\u201d (She hopes it isn\u2019t possible.)</p><p>\u201cAnything is possible,\u201d Willem says. \u201cYou can take a train, or one of the budget airlines. Though we should probably book something now.\u201d</p><p>He thinks about reaching for his computer, but at that moment, her hand has reached what it was looking for and he is useless. He closes his eyes. The girl he sees behind his lids is the girl who is in his bed. He has no desire to do anything to send her away.</p><p>Last year in Paris, she asked him to stay on with her, for just one day. He had wanted to, but he\u2019d been ambivalent, too. And that ambivalence had cost him.</p><p>Or maybe it hadn\u2019t. He thinks of what Kate and Wolfgang said. Maybe last year wasn\u2019t their time. But now is. He knows it. Right in his kishkes.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to go back right away?\u201d he asks her.</p> <p>She has the flight booked. And school starts in September. Though September is not for a few weeks, and flights can be changed.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you stay,\u201d Willem begins. \u201cFor just one\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Allyson doesn\u2019t wait for him to finish the question\u2014hour, day, week\u2014because her answer is the same.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
