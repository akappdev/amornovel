Five minutes to the opening speech. \u201cAll right, all right.\u201d She shrugged the lead-grey metal off her hand and caught her reflection in the mirror. The hair. She had forgotten about her hair.</p><p>Her gown looked fantastic. She loved this dress; the cut and color suited her: a shimmering grey-black that caught her breasts, wound about her waist and fell down in clean lines to brush the floor. Unfortunately, the gown alone wouldn\u2019t do it. Her hair set atop her head in an ugly pile, and it was too late to do anything about it. It\u2019s your fault, Robert, she thought, pulling out the pins one by one. She dragged the brush through her hair and inspected the result.</p><p>Hideous.</p> <p>That\u2019s fine, she decided. Nobody can be expected to be ran ragged for nine straight hours and then attend a banquet looking perfect.</p><p>A knock jarred her from her thoughts. \u201cOpen!\u201d</p><p>The door slid open, revealing Fatima Lee in her navy blue power-dress. Robert\u2019s aide-de-camp looked perfect, her hair a glossy black wave, her face fresh as if she had taken a long refreshing nap instead of the grueling administrative marathon.</p><p>\u201cThree minutes to opening speech. If we\u2019re late, Robert will suffer a deep space fit.\u201d</p><p>They headed out the door and down the winding hallway at the speed of a brisk march. Unbound by gravity, the makers of the Orbital Embassy had constructed an impossibly tall banquet hall, and the hallway circling it matched it in height. Today the huge walls and ceiling lost in darkness brought a sense of foreboding. Like going through some ancient Temple to be sacrificed.</p> <p>Fatima\u2019s communicator buzzed with voice of Michel Rashvili. \u201cWhere are you? Robert\u2019s losing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there in thirty seconds, tell his Excellency to keep his panties on.\u201d Fatima snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. The man can negotiate with terrorists with a needle rifle pressed to his temple, but banquets drive him up the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he can\u2019t control a banquet,\u201d Deirdre murmured. \u201cAnd the stakes are high.\u201d 30 million lives hanging in the balance would give anyone a pause.</p><p>They rounded the curve. The huge doors of the banquet chamber waited wide open just ahead, under the banner depicting the Duke of Rodkill, Robert\u2019s mentor and veritable legend in the annals of the Diplomatic Corps. Fatima zeroed in on the doors.</p><p>Several men dressed in black entered the hallway from a side passage, also aiming for the door. Deirdre caught Fatima\u2019s arm. \u201cThe Reigh.\u201d</p><p>The aide-de-camp halted. The Reigh moved in silence, like black ghosts, each carrying a vered, a short ceremonial branch, in left hand signifying their peaceful intentions. Tradition dictated they stayed silent when in sight of the enemy until given permission to speak by the Lord. For them, everyone is an enemy, Deirdre thought.</p> <p>They had to be desperate for the money to even enter the Orbital. Unfortunately, taking money for their military services was the very thing that the Reigh doctrine categorically forbade.</p><p>A tousled man shot out of the doors at a near run. Michel Rashvili mumbling into his communicator. As if in slow motion Deirdre saw him crash into the nearest Reigh. The black-gloved hand let go and the sign of peace clattered to the floor. Oh great Lao Tzu.</p><p>Michel stumbled, caught himself. His face went slack with shock. A short-range plasma firearm leaped into Fatima\u2019s hand almost on its own.</p><p>\u201cMichel, kneel!\u201d Deirdre approached and dropped to her knees.</p><p>Michel hit the floor next to her. Wide-eyed, he looked at the veled. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Should I?\u201d His voice shook.</p><p>\u201cNo. Keep your head down, don\u2019t look them in the eye.\u201d Very slowly Deirdre reached and picked up the branch off the floor. Holding it on her open palms, she raised it above her head, like an offering. Their eyes fixed on the floor, they waited. Moments dripped by, long and viscous. Finally the Reigh closest to her stepped forward. Leather brushed her palm, and the Reigh moved on, still silent, into the banquet hall. Deirdre remembered to breathe.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus.\u201d Michel straightened. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I knocked that out of his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d Fatima\u2019s firearm had vanished. There was no way it could be hidden in that tiny dress. \u201cHe dropped it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe dropped it,\u201d Deirdre confirmed, looking after the Reigh making their way through the banquet hall. \u201cWhen was the last time you fought in hand to hand combat, Michel?\u201d</p><p>The adjutant ran a shaking hand through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do it every day. Trust me, if that man didn\u2019t want to run into you, you wouldn\u2019t have touched him in a million years. Go hide somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo hide, dimwit.\u201d Fatima snorted. \u201cWhen Robert finds out, he\u2019ll blow his core. You want to give him a few hours to cool off.\u201d</p><p>The words finally made an impact and the adjutant took off down the hallway.</p><p>Deirdre frowned. \u201cWe have been tested, and I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve passed. Why do I have a feeling this isn\u2019t going to end well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it won\u2019t.\u201d Fatima\u2019s face was grim. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>For better or worse they entered the banquet hall.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>The red-furred Vunta officer at Deirdre\u2019s left smiled at her, exposing fifty two sharp teeth, arranged in twin rows in his cavernous mouth. The effect was enough to give a hardened Navy veteran a lifetime of nightmares.</p><p>\u201cYou wook wowery,\u201d he offered, sounding very much like a Terran Scottsman with a mouthful of tissue stuffed into his cheeks. He hit her with a direct, unblinking stare.</p><p>Trying to dominate. He should know better. \u201cThank you.\u201d She showed him her teeth and glared back.</p><p>For a moment they stared eye-to-eye, neither willing to back down. Deirdre ground her teeth. The sound died in the hum of the banquet hall but not before the Vunta heard it. A noise reserved for the alpha of the Vunta society, the grinding had the same effect on the Vunta as the scarping of the nails on a glass had on human ear. The officer wrinkled his muzzle and looked away.</p><p>Deirdre glanced across the hall at the Vunta, seated here and there at the tables. Too many flickering ears, too many flashes of teeth, too much animation in the gestures of furry paw-hands. Like sharks smelling blood in the water. What is going on? What do they know that we don\u2019t?</p><p>She looked to Robert, seated at the head table between the Vunta Ambassador and the elderly lemon-skinned Monrovian with mournful iconic eyes. Sir Robert Sergei Sarvini, Ambassador of the Second Intergalactic Empire to the Branches of Reigh, looked perfect: hair slicked back into a horse tail, handsome face shaven, trim figure sharp in Diplomatic Corps formal midnight blue. Urbane, debonair, eloquent, every inch worthy of the long list of titles attached to his name.</p><p>Robert\u2019s food lay untouched on his plate. Officially the banquet was thrown in honor of the successful treaty negotiations between the Monrovians and the Vunta Caliphate, for which the Empire, in the form of Robert, had provided a neutral meeting ground. Unofficially, Robert wanted to woo the Reigh. Unfortunately, he was stuck at the head table, sandwiched between the two treaty partners.</p><p>Their stares connected and in his eyes she read a confirmation. Yes, something\u2019s up. No, we don\u2019t know what. We can do nothing about it. Just sit tight and wait.</p><p>Deirdre sighed. There were four parties to this dance: the Vunta Caliphate, the Monrovian Republic, the Empire, and the Reigh. Each wanted something and would claw all others bloody to get it. All she wanted to do was to prevent a massacare.</p><p>She looked to the guest of honor table where the Lord Nagrad of the Reigh sat with Nina on one side and a white-furred Vunta dignitary on the other. The rest of the Reigh formed a line behind the table. None but the Lord had chosen to sit down. None ate or drank. A line from the Reigh Codex popped into her head: I will consume no food in the house of my enemy.</p><p>Nagrad\u2019s scarred face was grim. Had he been from an inner Imperial world, she would\u2019ve guessed him at eighty or ninety. Her painstaking research put him at closer to sixty. The only Reigh lord in the history of his people to entertain the idea of cooperation. His wife was dead. His entire family consisted of his son. And the Vunta Raiders were very afraid of him.</p><p>The Vunta dignitary shot Nagrad a toothy smile and said something. Nina cut in, smooth, breathtaking like a golden angel against the backdrop of black. Deirdre felt a stab of jealousy right in the stomach. Nina\u2019s perfect six foot and one inch tall figure was wrapped in a strapless gown of champagne-colored lace, accented with complex swirls of golden thread. The dress hugged her like a glove. The color perfectly complemented her light blonde hair and light bronze complexion.</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t we have her job?\u201d Fatima murmured at her right.</p><p>\u201cBecause we don\u2019t score 8:13 on the proportion scale,\u201d Deirdre said. \u201cAnd because we haven\u2019t been trained as escorts and we don\u2019t have a perfect recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Fatima said. \u201cYou know you could do what she does with your eyes closed. You\u2019re a freaking cultural attache. You know more about Reigh than all of us combined. You should be picking the Reigh Lord\u2019s brains, not she.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows what she\u2019s doing. My job is to compile and analyze the information. Her job is to keep the object of her attention enraptured.\u201d And it would be an incredibly difficult task, considering the strictness of the Reigh rules of conduct. Nothing off-color. Not a hint, not a joke, not even an idea of impropriety. No reference to sex, religion, or politics. Deirdre smiled. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly happy to advise her from the sidelines.\u201d</p><p>Fatima sneered. \u201cYou have no ambition. In the next life, you\u2019ll be reborn as a tea kettle.\u201d</p><p>Nina reached for a small appetizer and artfully offered it to the Reigh Lord. He accepted the tiny twisted dough puff and bit into it. Nina continued talking. She had a way to totally engage a person in conversation, until speaking to her appeared to be a reward in itself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Reigh Lord finished the puff. A nervous tick jerked his face once, twice. A grimaced twisted his features, baring his teeth. He arched his back, biting at the empty air. His hands flailed, knocking over the goblets and plates. A spasm gripped his body. He shuddered, froze, and fell back against his seat, foam sliding from his lips down his chin.</p><p>For a moment absolute silence claimed the hall. And then chaos broke.</p><p>Chapter 3</p> <p>The situation made absolutely no sense.</p><p>Deirdre dipped her fingers into the interface. The liquid metal coated her hand, climbing from her fingertips all the way to her wrist. It slid between her fingers, slightly cold, dry but slippery with silky smoothness, the way very fine sand might feel if individual sand granules were perfectly round. As the synaptic implants under her skin made connections with free floating nanoclusters, she felt her hand\u2013skin, muscle, ligament, and bone\u2013stretch impossibly far. She thought of the archive. The four petals of the unit ignited with pale green, and the huge collection of files, the sum total of her research and archival documents, flared into existence, projected into space above the petals</p><p>Ten feet away Robert slumped in the chair. In the corner Nina rubbed her face with her hands. The room was dim, the huge communication screens on the wall silent and dark, all except the one on the right side, showing the map of the sector. In the center of the map hung the Colchida Cluster, three stars, eleven habitable worlds total, four warp points, thirty million colonists. It used to belong to the Monrovian Republic. Situated too far from Monrovian industrial centers, it was all but worthless to the Republic. But to the Empire, the Cluster was a diamond in rough. Had the Empire been given a chance to develop the Cluster, it would\u2019ve become the biggest industrial and commercial base of the sector.</p><p>Unfortunately the Vunta Caliphate very much enjoyed raiding the Cluster while it was in the Monrovian possession. The numerous stars of the Caliphate, tinted with pale blue to show the territory boundaries, hung in the corner of the map like a storm cloud. It would take the Empire at least two decades to build up the defenses of the Cluster to a survivable level. Until then, the only guard against the Vunta were the Reigh, a thin ribbon of worlds tinted with green.</p><p>The Vunta wanted to make the last run at the Cluster, stripping it of all valuables. Hundreds of lives would be lost. The Empire would threaten war and the Caliphate would back off with apologies, but the budding economy of the Cluster would be wrecked. It would take decades and billions to recover.</p> <p>The Empire needed to protect the Cluster. The Reigh needed the money. But the Reigh doctrine forbade trading payment for military service. And so the staff of the Embassy had to figure out how to skirt the Reigh doctrine. To find an underhanded way to exchange money for protection with the people, who were forbidden to become mercenaries. Now it would never happen.</p><p>They were responsible for the safety of 30 million colonists and they blew it. The thought made her stomach lurch.</p><p>Deirdre sank deeper into the interface, both arms up to the elbow, speed-reading through the flurry of documents and her notes. She couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on it, but she was sure if she just figured out what it was her subconscious was trying to tell her, the situation would become logical.</p><p>Fatima moved on quiet feet to stand at Robert\u2019s side. \u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I would like is to travel back in time twenty four hours and strangle the sushi chef. How could we not know Nagrad was allergic to redfish caviar?\u201d</p><p>Deirdre heard the question. It sank in slowly, fighting its way through her focus.</p> <p>\u201cNumerous reasons,\u201d she said, still reading. \u201cNagrad could have not known he was allergic. He could have deliberately hidden the allergy so it wouldn\u2019t be used against him. He could\u2019ve been distracted by Nina and not realized what he was eating. The Vunta could\u2019ve poisoned him. Your theory is as good as mine\u2013all of them are total rubbish. \u201d</p><p>Robert startled. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>The tone of her voice snapped her out of her search. \u201cBecause the Reigh are suspicious paranoiacs, who also happen to be very poor actors.\u201d</p><p>She tossed the recording of the banquet to one of the side screens, fast-forwarding to the right frame. \u201cLook at him. Yes, he\u2019s taking pains to listen to Nina, but he\u2019s hardly absorbed. He can\u2019t even pretend to be interested enough to fool a casual observer. He\u2019s definitely not distracted enough to ignore poisonous food. Look at the line of faces behind him. They are about as relaxed as stone idols on New Barbar and they are watching him so hard, they don\u2019t even blink. Do you really think they would let him put something bad in his mouth? Not really. Nor would they let the Vunta mysteriously sprinkle something on his food. This whole thing makes no sense at all.\u201d</p><p>The main screen ignited and the face of Timur Gonzales came into the view. The Chief of Security looked slightly baffled, hooded dark eyes melancholy, long phlegmatic face relaxed, as if he just woke up from a long nap in sunshine. It made total sense that the Reigh would demand communication through him the Branch Nagrad and the Empire were now technically in the state of war. Unfortunately he had about as much diplomatic ability as Deirdre herself.</p><p>Timur dragged his fingers across his chin, stroking an imaginary beard. \u201cWe have contact.\u201d</p><p>Robert looked up. \u201cPatch them through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t talk to you,\u201d Deirdre said, almost at the same time as Timur. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re technically responsible for Nagrad\u2019s death. They would be honor-bound to kill you on sight,\u201d Deirdre said.</p><p>\u201cWhat she said,\u201d Timur added.</p><p>Robert growled. \u201cFine, patch them through on the side screen as a closed feed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve already delivered the terms.\u201d</p><p>The veins in Robert\u2019s temples bulged. \u201cFor Zeus\u2019s sake, would you stop wasting my time then and give me the bloody recording?\u201d</p><p>A harsh-faced Reigh filled the screen. \u201cYou\u2019ve robbed our Branch of a great man. You must atone. The bloodtree must be replenished. You will provide a woman for Lord Nagrad so an heir can be born. And you will pay a dowry. A very large dowry for the insult was grave. Thirty billion units.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre blinked. Brilliant. Lao Tzu, that was simply brilliant.</p><p>Robert exhaled. \u201cOut of the question! The entire Reigh Branch can survive for a decade on that money. Tell him.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre cut in. \u201cRobert, a marriage would make you related. He would be honor-bound to protect your possessions.\u201d</p><p>She watched the thought sink in. Robert\u2019s face took on an intense look of a hound closing in for a kill. \u201cAsk him if the marriage would mean Branch Nagrad would protect the Cluster in the event of a raid or invasion.\u201d</p><p>Timur intoned the words. Deirdre tuned him out, going back to her notes. She already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Timur relayed.</p><p>Robert leaned back. \u201cSo here it is. Nagrad Junior doesn\u2019t waste time, does he? Thirty billion is a bit steep, but it\u2019s doable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it. It\u2019s my responsibility.\u201d Nina rose with dignity, her voice hoarse. \u201cYou may tell Lord Nagrad that I accept his proposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want you,\u201d Timur said.</p><p>\u201cWell, who does he want?\u201d Robert asked.</p><p>Deirdre finally hit on the correct recording, thirty-two years ago, one of the first contact missions to the Reigh. The ceremonial trading of the swords, and sharing of the food. She zoomed the picture, focusing on the platter before the Survey Captain and a young-looking Reigh warrior.</p><p>Robert\u2019s face penetrated the projection. She looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cDeirdre,\u201d he said, his voice quiet and earnest. \u201cDo you remember your oath to the Diplomatic Corps? The part where you promised to dedicate your body and mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo serve to the most of my ability and to sacrifice my life should my duty demand it. Of course I remember.\u201d</p><p>Robert tried to pick up her hands but they were covered in the liquid interface. He settled on holding her shoulders instead. \u201cHow do you feel about sacrifice in a form of a marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Nagrad desires a meeting with his bride,\u201d the Reigh said. \u201cHe wants to determine that she is of sound body and free of mental retardation. She must be ready in one hour.\u201d</p><p>Robert wheeled about. \u201cOur shuttle. Tell him our people are coming with her and we want her safely delivered back or the deal is off.\u201d</p><p>After a momentary pause, the Reigh inclined his dark head. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>The hallways of the Nagrad Keep looked unlike anything Deirdre had imagined. She had pictured bleak dark walls; instead she found wall-long windows and a palette ranging from rust to fresh mint green. As she walked down the corridor between Timur and Johanna Bray, the red rays of the rising sun danced on the wall and slid on her gray dress, adding color to the fabric.</p><p>It didn\u2019t make her feel any better.</p><p>She recalled Robert\u2019s briefing: You\u2019re going there to haggle. Get him down to twenty billion. Take the initiative and don\u2019t let him control the conversation. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be there with you, but I promise you, I won\u2019t send you to him without backup again. This is just the first step, Deirdre. We have a long way to go before we\u2019ll agree on the amount.</p><p>The fact that she was being appraised like a cow at market apparently didn\u2019t bother him at all.</p><p>Their escort, a Reigh woman in black leather, led them to a wooden door and stepped inside, closing it behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d Deirdre murmured.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re hot,\u201d Timur said. \u201cBecause he hates blondes. Because a bug bit him this morning when he got out of bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had it on the first one,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty hot. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get you back up to the Orbital in one piece.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and their escort invited them into the room with a sweep of her hand.</p><p>Deirdre stepped through. Despite the large window, gloom pooled in the corners and snuck across soft rug. A single table stood in the middle of the room, lit by soft yellow light of a cluster lamp. Two chairs flanked the table. In a far chair sat a Reigh. Lean. Dressed in black like all of them. Black hair, cut short. He sat just outside the circle of light, and shadows masked his face. What a cheap trick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The escort moved forward, silent like a shadow, and held the second chair out for her. Here we go. Her knees trembled. This is so stupid. Why am I scared?</p><p>She forced herself to walk across the carpet. Timur followed. The Reigh gave him a flat stare and the chief of security halted a few feet away. Deirdre sat.</p><p>\u201cLord Nagrad, I presume.\u201d Her voice sounded almost normal.</p> <p>The Reigh inclined his head. She could see him now. He had a hard face, not handsome but not unpleasant. Square jaw, strong nose. The same sharp intelligence she saw in his father\u2019s eyes showed full force in his. How old is he? Thirty?</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeirdre Lebed. I know.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his voice almost made her jump. She looked past him, trying to collect herself, and saw four shadows in the depth of the room. Bodyguards.</p><p>Take away the initiative. Right. \u201cWould you mind if I asked you a question?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease, feel free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy choose a foreign wife? One who is unfamiliar with the traditions and culture? Why not just take the monetary restitution?\u201d</p><p>He braided the fingers of his hands into a single fist. \u201cTo accept a bribe for the loss of life is forbidden by the doctrine. Besides, a woman from outside the Reigh has several advantages. The man is the trunk of a family, but the woman is its root. In our society, men own the children and the means of war. Everything else is owned by the woman. And too often a woman\u2019s first loyalty is to her mother instead of her husband. It tends to make matters complicated. A woman of the foreign blood has no one to turn to. She would exist solely at the mercy of her husband.\u201d</p><p>Fantastic. This conversation was going a long way to allay her concerns about becoming a bride.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d the Reigh Lord permitted himself a small smile. \u201cOur traditions are rather binding. There are certain things a man could ask of foreign woman that would be considered unclean by the women of the Reigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of things?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThings of sexual nature. Do you consider yourself open-minded in those matters, Lady Deirdre? Would you do all those things at my request?\u201d</p><p>If he was willing to walk down the road, it was perfectly fine with her. With Reigh being as rigid as they were, it was likely he\u2019d bail first. Deirdre arched her eyebrows. \u201cVery few women within the Empire do all things, Lord Nagrad. I cannot confirm what I may or may not do without knowing what you have in mind. Would you be more specific?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and waited for him to back off.</p><p>\u201cWould you suck my cock?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She stared at him for a long moment, trying to make sure she didn\u2019t mishear. Behind her someone made a strangled noise.</p><p>The Reigh Lord waited for her answer. His face was perfectly solemn.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She cleared her throat, desperately hoping she didn\u2019t blush. \u201cI suppose that could be hrhm arranged under certain circumstances. Is there any other requests you would like to make?\u201d</p><p>He raised his hand. One of the shadows detached itself from the gloom and brought a platter with a thin pseudo-paper magazine. She hadn\u2019t seen pseudo-paper since her days at Altair museums during her graduate on the Colonial Journalism.</p> <p>Nagrad took the magazine off the platter and put it on the table. The digital photograph on the cover left no doubt as to what kind of a publication it was. He flipped the pages and pushed the magazine toward her. \u201cWould you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He flipped another page. \u201cThis one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one?\u201d</p><p>She felt the blush creeping onto her cheeks. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this one?\u201d</p><p>She squinted, trying to make sense of the naked shapes. \u201cIs that even possible? Wouldn\u2019t you have to have low G for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a very strong woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m that strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose we could arrange a shuttle trip than,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. Thirty billion is an outrageously large sum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so? Considering the scale of the injury, I believe it\u2019s just right.\u201d He flipped the page. \u201cHow about this one?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Robert\u2019s face was incredulous. \u201cYou didn\u2019t drop him at all? Not even by half a bil? Oh Hermes, a child could\u2019ve done better.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre threw the recorder onto the table. Nagrad\u2019s face, frozen on the screen, mocked her with grey eyes. \u201cWhat do you want from me, Robert? Every time I tried to bring up the money, he would show me more porn. The man asked me if I would suck his cock! How do you counter that?\u201d</p><p>A soft voice interrupted, \u201cBy saying, \u2018That would depend on the size of your instrument, my lord. Would you care to take off your pants so I can determine if it would be a good fit?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Robert bent in a half, \u201cMy lord.\u201d</p><p>She turned to see an older man in soft green tunic. He gave her a light smile, as if he was too polite to laugh at his own off-color joke.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, the Duke of Rodkil.\u201d Fatima\u2019s heels clicked together.</p><p>Deirdre bowed. The living legend placed his hand onto her shoulder. Imposing on the portraits, in person he appeared rather slight, short with narrow, bird-boned frame. \u201cNo need to bend your back, my dear. I understand Robert called me as soon as he knew, but despite all of our progress, there are times when the interstellar travel isn\u2019t quite fast enough.\u201d He nodded at Nagrad on the screen. \u201cA very shrewd man. Let\u2019s see if we can cut him down a bit, shall we? I\u2019ll need all of the background you have.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Deirdre shrugged the interface off her hands and leaned back against the seat. Her head throbbed. The ancient diplomat was still speed-reading, submerged in the interface up to his elbow.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the significance of kneeling? Submission?\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her temples. \u201cNot exactly, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d she repeated, trying to ignore the absurdity of referring to a recipient of the Diamond Sword by his first name. \u201cThe Reigh don\u2019t submit. Not even in battle\u2013when they surrender, they raise their hands to the sides, daring a thrust to the stomach. The kneeling It\u2019s more a gesture of ultimate respect. A Reigh kneels only before his Lord and only once, at the acceptance into service. A Reigh Lord kneels before no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA quaint culture. So many references to the vegetative symbolism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The Duke Jason glanced at her. \u201cYou should sleep, my dear. You look exhausted. He\u2019s likely to call for another meeting tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWhy? I couldn\u2019t haggle him down. He\u2019d be smart to avoid us so he can hold on to the original sum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he knows you don\u2019t control the proverbial purse strings. He\u2019s perfectly aware the real fight is ahead and he doesn\u2019t want to give us enough time to regroup.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cHe caught me off-guard. I expected coldness, some sort of brutal physical test, perhaps a ritual where I\u2019d have to untangle tree branches without breaking the leaves or untie an impossible knot. I didn\u2019t expect dirty pictures. It goes against everything I know about them. It makes me question my assumptions.\u201d</p><p>Jason shook his head. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen so far is both thorough and well documented. Your conclusions are logical and, I wager, quite accurate. Robert is very lucky to have you, and he knows it, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have called me.\u201d The Duke chuckled. \u201cQuite a hit to his pride, to have to call your former mentor out of retirement. But back to the Reigh, don\u2019t doubt the entire body of your research on the basis of Lord Nagrad. In diplomacy, like in great many other things, the rules of engagement survive only until one remarkable person decides to break them. It\u2019s just our luck we stumbled across such a person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, and the fact that I\u2019m a lousy diplomat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo each his own. You\u2019re an excellent analyst. Not everyone is born with the gift of snappy comeback. But you should rest. And don\u2019t worry, we may yet get you out of this mess.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>This time the meeting fell onto afternoon, and the sunlight filled the room. Nagrad waited in precisely the same position Deirdre had seen him the first time.</p><p>\u201cGreetings, Lady Deirdre. And Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Jason smiled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware I\u2019m well know to the Reigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Nagrad assured him.</p><p>\u201cVery well, Lord Nagrad.\u201d Jason rubbed his hands together. \u201cIn that case shall we dispense with preliminary niceties? Let\u2019s talk money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>They launched into the foray like two warriors, amidst clashing blades and thudding shields. By the second hour Deirdre lost the thread of the argument. By the fourth she caught herself dousing off.</p><p>Nagrad\u2019s voice snapped her from her reverie. \u201cI do believe the lady is tired. Let us take a break.\u201d He offered her his hand. \u201cWould my lady care for some fresh air?\u201d</p><p>To say no would\u2019ve been an insult. She put her hand in his and let him lead her out to the balcony. Big enough for a decent size party, the semicircular balcony extended out good twenty five meters. Nagrad maneuvered all the way to its farthest point and stopped at an ornate amber and white rail. The keep protruded from the side of the mountain and as she looked down below to where the forest shimmered awash with green leaves, a curious feeling of peace filled Deirdre. Bright blue and red birds flittered from branch to branch. Somewhere a distant relative of the Vunta howled once. She inhaled the air. It tasted sweet.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI forgot how lovely the planetside can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s home,\u201d he said simply, putting the world into a single word.</p><p>Deirdre leaned on the rail. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re attractive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I greatly admire your body.\u201d</p><p>She blushed.</p><p>\u201cOf work,\u201d he added and offered her his reader. A list of recent publications lit the screen. The top one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis hasn\u2019t been publicized. It\u2019s classified information.\u201d She took the reader and tapped the top title with the stylus. Here it was, the entire contents of her Reigh research. \u201cHow did you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was brought to my attention by a party concerned that we may have a loose mouth in our midst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tapped the Embassy\u2019s network.\u201d She stared at him stunned. Lao-Tzu, what else he could have access to?</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that difficult actually.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t afford informants in my branch, no more than you can tolerate the blame for my father\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no informants.\u201d She handed the reader back to him.</p><p>\u201cI realized that once I\u2019ve read through your analysis. To have deduced that much from external indicators is remarkable.\u201d</p><p>The extent of his arrogance was even more remarkable. Deirdre looked at him. \u201cThen perhaps you would enjoy another deduction.\u201d She slid the square of a reader card from her data bracelet and snapped it into the reader. The recording of a peace meeting from three decades ago filled the screen. \u201cThis is the Survey Captain Sean Kozlov. And this, I believe, is your father. They are performing a peace ritual\u2013they have fished together and now they are sharing their catch.\u201d She tapped the screen, forcing it to zoom. \u201cThey are eating redfish. And redfish caviar.\u201d</p><p>Nagrad watched the screen. The impassive mask slipped and in his face she saw profound sadness.</p> <p>\u201cYour father wasn\u2019t allergic to caviar,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMy father was born without immunity to black moss.\u201d Nagrad kept his gaze on the reader. \u201cA genetic failure, a mutation that for some reason wasn\u2019t detected. He had survived for sixty four years without contracting the infection. We didn\u2019t realize he was sick until he began coughing black dust. Very rare in these times, unfortunately, it still happens.\u201d</p><p>The black moss was incurable. Two month incubation period and then a soft death, as the victim fell asleep to never awaken. Instead of passing on in his bed, the Reigh Lord died in agony amidst strangers. \u201cHe took his own life.\u201d</p><p>Nagrad leaned back. \u201cHe felt his death must serve the Branch. The only difficulty lay in finding the poison that would imitate an allergic reaction to redfish. The death didn\u2019t happen as quickly as we had hoped.\u201d</p><p>The realization struck her. \u201cYou were there,\u201d she said. \u201cWere you the one who took the veled off my hand?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes for a briefest of moments. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou stood there and you watched your father die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was my Lord. I honored his wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died to give you an excuse to take a bribe from the Empire.\u201d</p><p>Nagrad\u2019s face gained a dangerous edge. \u201cYes. And the Branch desperately needs the money. And you may be assured, my Lady, that I will do everything in my power to squeeze every last unit I can from your realm. To do any less would be to dishonor his death.\u201d</p><p>He took the card from the reader and offered it to her, but she closed his fist about it. \u201cIt belongs to you.\u201d</p><p>Before he could say anything else, she shook her head. \u201cI understand, Lord Nagrad. I truly do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you despise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I admire you.\u201d She walked away so he wouldn\u2019t see her face.</p> <p>Chapter 8</p><p>The evening brought a cup of fragrant tea and a knock on Deirdre\u2019s door. \u201cCome in,\u201d she yelled, wishing with all her being the visitor would go away. Nina Carrest entered the room. Dressed into a soft robe that looked like it had been slept in, her hair pulled back from her face in a hastily made pony tail, Nina looked radiantly beautiful.</p><p>It was simply not fair that a woman should do absolutely nothing and look this good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m here.\u201d Nina shifted uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cPlease come in.\u201d</p><p>They sat on the soft circular couch and drank tea together. \u201cI feel responsible.\u201d Nina rubbed her left temple. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think that I came here because I feel guilty and I want you to tell me it will be fine and it\u2019s not my fault. I just it should\u2019ve been me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve been me anyway.\u201d Deirdre sat her teacup back onto the table. \u201cThe Reigh had hacked the Orbital\u2019s database. I\u2019m apparently the only one who didn\u2019t know this. Robert fed them my research on purpose. Lord Nagrad very much wanted to meet me. He would\u2019ve found an occasion to do so, one way or the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, I fed his father that appetizer.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre offered her a smile. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about that. The old Lord Nagrad didn\u2019t die from an allergic attack. He was terminally ill and had taken poison so his son would have pretext to ask the Empire for the monetary compensation. His son was right there among the guards. He watched him die.\u201d</p><p>Nina paled. \u201cThat\u2019s monstrously cold bloodied.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre sighed. Some things were harder to explain than others. She pulled her portable to her. A small part of her rebelled against interfacing this late. She had wanted the evening to last, to drink her tea, and enjoy the few minutes of comfort, to work on herself by being still. But the need to explain nagged her into dipping her hand into the liquid metal. She watched it creep up to mid-palm no need for more and waited until the sensation of stretching subsided enough to speak.</p><p>\u201cThe first colonists to have settled on some of the Reigh worlds pre-Second Empire were the Sureks. The word \u2018lahiko\u2019, the Reigh\u2019s substitution for \u201cclan\u201d, is thought to have been a corruption of Surek Luh-iko, meaning literally \u2018branch.\u2019 However, if you ask a Reigh to pronounce it, he will say, \u2018Lehgio.\u2019 An almost perfectly preserved, true Latin pronunciation of legion.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre played with the interface and it projected a small map of the Reigh territory. \u201cDuring the Melasyan conflict, a large part of Melasyus\u2019s army broke off, upset by his failure to secure peace. At this point they had been unpaid for over five standard years. They hadn\u2019t seen their families. Most of them didn\u2019t have families since the Planars had wiped planet after planet with their toxins. They\u2019d had enough and they took their ships and left. Seven legions.\u201d</p><p>She highlighted the home worlds of the seven branches of the Reigh one by one. \u201cThey were hardened veterans, disciplined, supreme warriors, whom Melasyus strove to make into \u2018New Romans\u2019. All they wanted was peace.\u201d</p><p>Nina\u2019s gaze was fixed on the map. She refilled their cups without looking.</p><p>\u201cThey came here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. There are more factors in play here than just a single word. For example, these branches on Nagrad\u2019s standard. If we take off the leaves\u201d she called up a standard and swiped the abundance of stylized leaves from the branches.\u201d and we have the Roman numeral XXVI. The twenty-fourth legion. And so on. My theory is that the legionnaires put as much distance as they could between themselves and Melasyus\u2019 ambitions and settled here, mixing with native Surek population. Thirty years ago they were found. Only eight generations since they had left. They are paranoid, extremely martially proficient, and ruled by a doctrine of personal discipline and distrust of outsiders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe legionnaires had stripped several worlds before they perpetrated their escape. Their descendants stretched those supplies for a long time,\u201d Deirdre continued. \u201cBut they lacked the expertise to really build an industrial base. I\u2019ve pulled the logs of their known purchases and ran a projection analysis. They are adept at keeping the fleet and armaments going, but they are rapidly depleting their supplies. Chances are they don\u2019t have access to tech developed in the last two hundred years. Also the fact that Lord Nagrad hadn\u2019t undergone a genetic screening leads me to believe they\u2019re running out of medical equipment. They need vaccines. They need production facilities. They need new tech, but they don\u2019t have an overabundance of natural resources nor do they have access to some unique goods. They can\u2019t make their money in trade. In fact, the only resource they can export is themselves they are superior warriors. Unfortunately their doctrine forbids them to do exactly that. They must fight for a cause. If this continues...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will be overrun by the Vunta,\u201d Nina said.</p><p>Deirdre nodded and shrugged the interface from her hand. \u201cThey must find a way to obtain financial resources without breaking the foundation of their society. Or they must give up being who they are. Lord Nagrad came up with a short-term fix. I believe his solution cost his son a great deal of pain.\u201d</p><p>Nina looked at her. \u201cTell me about him.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre thought about it. \u201cVery smart. He has very light eyes, grey with a little bit of green. He\u2019s tall. He bends slightly toward you when he speaks. He has large hands and almost never gesticulates. When you speak to him, you get a sense that if he hates you, he\u2019d kill you in a second, but if he likes you, he would do all he could to keep you from harm. It\u2019s a curious feeling.\u201d</p><p>Nina was smiling.</p><p>\u201cDid I say something funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Will you really marry him?\u201d</p><p>That was a question she had successfully avoided asking herself for two days now. \u201cI don\u2019t see how I have any choice in the matter. If I didn\u2019t have to marry him, I would\u2019ve requested an extension anyway. The research material I had compiled here is my best work. I want to know more about them. Looks like I\u2019ll get to, just not in a way I had planned.\u201d</p><p>The comscreen behind her erupted in a series of beeps and almost immediately somebody hammered on her door. She ordered it open, and Robert burst into the room.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed! The Vunta overbid us!\u2019 \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Vunta just offered Nagrad the thirty billion he wanted in a Brotherhood Pact. He gets exclusive rights to raiding on the fourth world of the Colchida Cluster. We must bid higher, but I have to get approval before I can commit. It will take the com launch at least twenty eight standard hours to reach us with the answer. We must stall until the Treasury approves the expense. We have eight hours until the sun rises to come up with a plan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Deirdre crossed her arms on her chest. \u201cWhat do you mean stall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll want this matter concluded now, before the Vunta back off, but he can\u2019t just back out of the marriage, so he\u2019ll demand a higher amount and when we fail to deliver, he will claim to be gravely insulted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could pretend to be sick,\u201d Nina said.</p> <p>\u201cNo, then he\u2019ll claim we\u2019re insulting him by withholding her.

I mean like in real life?\u201d Michel wondered.</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d Duke of Rodkil yawned. \u201cIt\u2019s overrated.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre blinked her eyes, trying to stay awake. Whatever embarrassment she had possessed had fled hours ago.</p><p>Robert surveyed the room strewn in pornography sheets and sex toys. \u201cIt looks like we had an orgy.\u201d He stifled a yawn, gave up and yawned. \u201cNow look what you\u2019re started, Rashvili. Don\u2019t you know yawning is contagious? We all need a nap.\u201d</p><p>Nina put her head down and snored.</p><p>\u201cHighly appropriate post-orgy, I would say,\u201d His Grace murmured.</p><p>The comscreen flared and the face of the chief of security came into the view. Nina jerked awake.</p><p>\u201cWe have contact with the Reigh. They want the bride and they want her now.\u201d Timur squinted. \u201cWhat exactly have you all been doing?\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 10</p><p>The booster shot coursed through Deirdre\u2019s veins, spreading a slightly cool sensation all the way from her toes to her scalp. She felt light as a feather. Twelve hour from now she would pay the price by passing out, but for now she felt fantastic.</p><p>The elation evaporated when she entered the meeting room. The Reigh guard had been doubled. Nagrad\u2019s face promised a storm.</p><p>\u201cAre you prepared to accept my terms?\u201d</p><p>The question wasn\u2019t aimed at her, but the harsh tone lanced her anyway.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Lord Nagrad,\u201d Jason smoothly said.</p><p>\u201cThirty billion?\u201d The disbelief was plain on Nagrad\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. However, before the moneys and the lady can exchange hands, there is a small matter that requires your attention. A mere formality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat matter?\u201d</p><p>The Duke smiled. \u201cIn accordance with the formal union contract, the bride requests a full accounting of her duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve delivered the full accounting during our first meeting.\u201d</p><p>Not even a single glance in her direction. I am just an animal to be sold and bought.</p><p>\u201cYes, but the accounting states, and I quote, \u2018...and to not shun the husband\u2019s request in the bedroom, lest she sabotage the begetting of an heir.\u2019 This fails to specify the exact nature of your attentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was also covered in our first meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my lord,\u201d she said, keeping her voice as sweet as she could. \u201cThat was but a very small part. The subject must be explored fully before I commit to you. I have a right to know what is required of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve taken the liberty of preparing a short list of all \u2018duties\u2019 known to the bride.\u201d With elegance of a dancer, Jason slid the reader card onto the table. \u201cAll that remains is for us to examine each entry and to determine whether or not it will enter into accounting. Should you require anything beyond what is detailed here, we will do our best to incorporate it into our list.\u201d</p><p>Nagrad slid the card into his reader. It took him a good minute to scroll to the end of the list. His eyes blazed. \u201cHow many entries are here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive hundred and forty five.\u201d The Duke\u2019s voice couldn\u2019t have been sweeter.</p><p>\u201cI request all of them,\u201d Nagrad said.</p><p>\u201cIn accordance to entry two hundred and three, will you then submit to having a cast of your anal canal so the dildo employed to penetrate your anus can be made to perfect proportions?\u201d</p><p>The Reigh bodyguards froze.</p><p>Nagrad read the entry. \u201cI won\u2019t be requesting that one.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre leaned forward. \u201cWith all due respect, my lord, I insist you review each one to avoid such misunderstandings.\u201d</p><p>He finally turned to her. \u201cI refuse to submit to this idiocy. The list could take days to review.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my right under the law. You must review the list with the witnesses present. You have made an offer of a formal commitment. It cannot be withdrawn lightly.\u201d</p><p>She could almost hear him grinding his teeth. \u201cYou are not a Reigh. You have no rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. You gave them to me when you delivered the statement of full accounting of my duties and requested a dowry. You have followed the law up to this point as if I was a Reigh bride. Does the doctrine exist only until it suits you, my Lord?\u201d</p><p>For a moment she thought he\u2019d reach across the table and strangle her. Instead he sat back. His face relaxed it must\u2019ve taken a monumental effort of will on his part and the Reigh lord picked up the reader. \u201cVery well. The first section is titled \u2018Terms and Devices\u2019. I believe we can skip that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould my lord care to define the term anal plug?\u201d Deirdre asked. \u201cHow about the difference between the soft and a hard one?\u201d</p><p>If his eyes could shoot lightning, she would\u2019ve been fried on the spot.</p><p>\u201cVery well then.\u201d His Grace announced with a placating smile. \u201cTerm number one: penis. Also known as dick, cock, Johnson, lance, sword, thruster, little soldier.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre leaned toward. \u201cYou may want to call for some refreshments, my lord. It will be a very long day.\u201d</p><p>Four hours later Nagrad tossed his reader onto the table. \u201cI need some fresh air.\u201d</p><p>He strode onto the balcony. Deirdre rose, stretching, and went outside also.</p><p>The second she stepped out of the room, Nagrad took her by the elbow. \u201cCome with me, my Lady.\u201d</p><p>His touch on her arm was very light, yet she knew with absolute certainty she couldn\u2019t get away. He led her to the farthest point of the balcony out of the ear shot of the bodyguards within the room. \u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it\u2019s you. You came up with this farce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gives you that idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were gloating in every second of it. Why are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI simply want to know what\u2019s required of me.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her, plainly trying to keep control of himself. \u201cThis matter could be settled later. It\u2019s of no consequence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s of a great consequence to me. You opened the door, all I had to do was walk through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI opened the door?\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cTemper, temper, my Lord. I\u2019m sure your guards would rush to my rescue if you were to choke me. Patience is a virtue.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cGod preserve the man who makes an enemy of you.\u201d He turned on his heel and stalked off.</p><p>Deirdre sighed and went back to the room. As she slumped into her chair, His Grace leaned to her. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy future husband hates me with a passion of a thousand stars,\u201d she said.</p><p>The Duke gently patted her hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>\u201cEntry number three hundred and twelve: Multiple partners.\u201d The Duke droned on.</p><p>Deirdre put her head onto her hands. Post-booster cooldown required at least twelve hours of sleep. She barely got eight before the Reigh demanded her presence. Her head hurt. Her ears were filled with something soft and mushy. Across the table Nagrad looked exhausted. The two Reigh witnesses, picked by him from the bodyguard, didn\u2019t look much better.</p><p>\u201cSubsection A. Two male partners and one female partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPass,\u201d Nagrad called. There were deep bags under his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLet it be known that Lord Nagrad abandons all claim to the act described in entry number three hundred and twelve, subsection A and all the subsequent positions described or listed under subsection A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo noted,\u201d the witnesses intoned.</p><p>Everyone made the appropriate notations in their copy of the list.</p><p>\u201cSubsection B: Two female partners and one male partner.\u201d The Duke waited for a moment, but Nagrad appeared absorbed in his reader.</p><p>\u201cPosition one: the male partner assumes horizontal position with his back to the surface. The first female partner kneels.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre rolled her eyes. Just pass now, you know you can\u2019t take it in front of the witnesses. Nagrad listened to the description with the look of somber concentration. \u201cPass,\u201d he said finally.</p><p>\u201cLet it be known that Lord Nagrad abandons all claim to the act described in entry number three hundred and twelve, subsection A, position one.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre stuck her tongue out at him.</p><p>Nagrad mouthed, \u201cAfter we\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo noted,\u201d the witnesses mumbled.</p><p>\u201cPosition number two: the first female partner clasps the male partner\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The Duke\u2019s comlink beeped. \u201cExcuse me. It appears I have an urgent call.\u201d He strode away onto the balcony.</p><p>Deirdre put her head onto the table with a soft bump. Marry me off, I don\u2019t care. I just want some sleep.</p><p>She heard the Duke\u2019s footsteps. They stopped next to her. \u201cThirty five billion,\u201d he said softly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She raised her head. Nagrad sat very still.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an extraordinary offer.\u201d A slow kind smile softened the Duke\u2019s face. \u201cYou won\u2019t get a better one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Nagrad breathed.</p> <p>There. The odd look on his face, relief mixed with surprise, brought out her own smile. We did it, she thought. We saved the cluster and we saved you and your people. She watched the beginning of a smile curl his lips. In this moment of joy, he seemed almost vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cThirty six billion, if you abandon your claim to Deirdre,\u201d the Duke said.</p><p>Cold washed over her. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s over. I will never see him again.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nagrad said.</p><p>\u201cWe both know it was never about the girl. Let her go.\u201d</p> <p>Nagrad\u2019s face snapped back into an impenetrable mask. \u201cShe stays or the deal is off.\u201d</p><p>The Duke drew himself to his full height, suddenly regal and terrifying. \u201cAsk yourself, would you truly force yourself on this woman?\u201d</p><p>Nagrad looked at her. \u201cDo you want out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a brilliant career ahead of her,\u201d the Duke said. \u201cDon\u2019t stand in her way.\u201d</p><p>Nagrad took her hand and swept her off the chair. \u201cA minute of your time, my Lady.\u201d He pushed past the Duke and drew her outside.</p><p>I\u2019m so sick of running onto this balcony, a thought flashed through her head.</p> <p>Nagrad ran his hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m past my undergrowth years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an adolescent anymore. What I mean to say is, women no longer unsettle me.\u201d He held up his hands, seemingly lost or words. \u201cThis is harder than I thought.\u201d</p><p>He looked so lost that she laughed softly. \u201cDid I unsettle you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, relieved. \u201cI... miss you when you\u2019re away. I think of you. I don\u2019t want you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were ready to trade me in for the Vunta billions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI would\u2019ve done whatever was best for the Branch. What would you have done in my place?\u201d</p><p>Deirdre looked at the forest beyond the balcony. \u201cIn your place I would\u2019ve auctioned myself off if I thought I\u2019d get more than one bid.\u201d</p> <p>The Duke and the bodyguards were watching them.</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew what to say,\u201d Nagrad said. \u201cBut if you give me a chance, I think I would come to love you very much. Marry me and I promise you I\u2019ll be as loyal to you as my father was to me. I\u2019ll do everything I can to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>The way he looked at her made Deirdre\u2019s heart flutter.</p><p>He took a deep breath and glanced at the audience waiting in the room. \u201cThey will only see it once.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, deliberately he knelt before her. \u201cStay,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that won\u2019t do,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThe Reigh Lord doesn\u2019t kneel before anyone.\u201d She knelt next to him. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d</p><p>She brushed his lips with hers and he kissed her, her mouth eager and warm. \u201cIt\u2019s a yes,\u201d she murmured when they came up for air. \u201cOn one condition. You have to tell me your name, because I am not moaning \u2018lord Nagrad\u2019 on our wedding night.\u201d</p><p>END </p> </body></html>"]
