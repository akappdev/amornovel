The last six months had been hell.</p><p>Paul had gone to Virgin River back in the autumn to help finish Jack Sheridan\u2019s new house. Much to his surprise, he discovered Vanessa Rutledge was living in Virgin River with her father and younger brother while her husband, Matt, served in Iraq. She was pregnant with Matt\u2019s baby and looking more beautiful than ever. Seeing her had reminded Paul of the serious \u201cthing\u201d he\u2019d had for Vanessa since first laying eyes on her all those years ago. But his best friend was the one she had married. Then life went into fast forward.</p><p>Just before the baby was born they all had a video conference with Matt. The call was mostly for Matt and Vanni as it was the first time in six months they\u2019d seen one another. Then everyone else got to say a quick hi and when it was Paul\u2019s turn Matt had said to him, \u201cIf anything goes wrong over here, look after Vanni.\u201d</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t have gone more wrong. Matt was killed in an explosion in Baghdad the first week in December. It had been a terrible time and Vanni had asked Paul to stay until the baby came\u2014another two months. Of course he agreed, and all that time he held it together so Vanni could lean on him. But the strain of the situation, his secret love for Vanni and his grief for his best friend ate him alive.</p><p>He thought going home to Grants Pass would ease the pain or at least distract him from it, but instead the pressure continued to build. A night out drinking with some of his construction crew and getting painfully loaded, only added a miserable headache to his breaking heart. He felt like a dead man, slogging through the days, tossing through the sleepless nights.</p><p>Without thinking too much about it, he called a woman he\u2019d been out with a couple of times. Terri. He needed the distraction of someone who wasn\u2019t already caught up in his drama. What qualified Terri was that their friendship had been easy; there was no clinging, no expectations. Plus, she used to make him laugh. She was simply a nice young woman, twenty-nine years to Paul\u2019s thirty-six. Terri was the only woman he\u2019d been out with in a couple of years, and he hadn\u2019t talked to her in six months. That, if anything, should have told him something, but he hadn\u2019t been paying attention.</p><p>He started out the conversation with, \u201cHey, Terri. Long time.\u201d He asked her to dinner, but first confirmed that she wasn\u2019t in a relationship\u2014he didn\u2019t want to complicate her life.</p><p>She laughed at that. \u201cI wish,\u201d she said. \u201cNo boyfriend, Paul. In fact, I\u2019ve hardly gone out in the past few months. Let\u2019s go someplace quiet and low-key, just catch up.\u201d This was just the response he\u2019d been hoping for and he\u2019d been so grateful.</p> <p>Paul rang her doorbell and when she came to her apartment door, he realized he had forgotten how pretty she was. Small of stature with shoulder-length dark brown hair and large eyes, she flashed him the bright, sexy smile that first got his attention a year ago. She laughed that wild laugh of hers and threw her arms around his neck. \u201cGod, it\u2019s great to see you! I can\u2019t wait to hear your excuse for disappearing for months!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, remember Rosa\u2019s? That hole-in-the-wall Mexican place? How about we go there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove it,\u201d she said.</p><p>Paul stared straight ahead as he drove them to the restaurant, his jaw locked. He tapped his fingers on the steering wheel and shifted in his seat; maybe this wasn\u2019t such a good idea, he thought. When they walked in the door, Terri pointed to a dark, corner booth and said, \u201cBack there.\u201d And when they sat down she said, \u201cYou\u2019re not a real talkative guy, Paul, but it\u2019s obvious something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got back to town from California. I\u2019m a little behind on everything.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s more than that. You\u2019re upset and nervous, and I wasn\u2019t going to say anything, but you have dark circles, like you\u2019re not sleeping. Since I haven\u2019t seen or heard from you in a long time, I know it isn\u2019t anything I did. You act like you just got out of prison. Go ahead\u2014I\u2019m a good listener.\u201d</p> <p>That was all it took. He ordered himself a beer and a glass of wine for Terri and let it spill. Best friend, dead. Best friend\u2019s wife pregnant. Him hanging around, trying his best to hold her up.</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cYou could have called me, you know. I mean, going through something horrible and not having anyone to talk to can make things so much worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like a real jerk dumping on you now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, save it. I\u2019m a girl, girls talk about their tragedies and heartaches. And if you don\u2019t get it out, it\u2019s going to eat a hole in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it feels,\u201d Paul admitted. \u201cLike I swallowed acid. Matt and I became best friends in junior high. I have two brothers but Matt was an only child, so he spent more time at my house than his own. We served in the Marine Corps together\u2014he stayed active while I went to the reserves. I think my mom and dad were hit as hard by his death as I was. But his wife...Aw, Terri. I\u2019ve never seen anything so painful. Here she was, about to have their first child, and she would cry until she was weak and dry. All I could do was hold her. But it was worse at night when the only sound in the house was Vanni sobbing in bed.\u201d</p><p>Terri reached for his hand. \u201cPaul...\u201d</p><p>He held her hand while he talked. \u201cWhen the baby came, she wanted me with her. Because Matt couldn\u2019t be, I guess. It was the worst and best thing I\u2019ve ever done, seeing that baby being born. It made me so proud to hold Matt\u2019s baby.\u201d He looked away and blinked back emotion. \u201cOn his headstone they put Matt Rutledge, beloved husband, father, brother, son, friend. That brother part\u2014that was for me, for us, the brothers in arms. It just doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s gone. But he\u2019s so gone and I just can\u2019t seem to get over it. And if I\u2019m feeling this way then Vanni must be torn to pieces.\u201d</p><p>Right then the food was delivered, but they didn\u2019t eat much. Paul had another beer and told her stories of growing up with Matt, playing football, driving their parents\u2019 cars too fast, trying to hustle girls with little success, enlisting in the Corps after two years of college and Matt\u2019s parents going absolutely, totally, cosmically nuts. \u201cMy parents weren\u2019t happy, but Matt\u2019s were out of their minds. Matt\u2019s mother was convinced that I\u2019d talked Matt into it, but the truth is, that\u2019s what he wanted. Period. I went along because I didn\u2019t want him going in alone. Or maybe I didn\u2019t want to stay behind without him. My mom used to say we were joined at the hip.\u201d</p> <p>Their plates were taken away, and they lingered over coffee while Paul continued to reminisce. Pretty soon they\u2019d been in that corner booth for a couple of hours.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lost anyone that close,\u201d Terri said, her eyes liquid. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be. You should have called me, Paul. You shouldn\u2019t have shouldered that alone, without support.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand. \u201cWhen I called you, I didn\u2019t have any intention of dumping all this on you. At least not consciously. I thought you\u2019d take my mind off it for a while. But talking to someone who isn\u2019t in the middle of it helps,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole bunch of \u2019em in Virgin River are so frickin\u2019 torn up\u2014Vanni, her dad, her little brother\u2014I couldn\u2019t let down my guard for a second. Even around my own family\u2014my mom starts crying the second Matt\u2019s name comes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must feel like you\u2019re going to explode,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I wish?\u201d Paul said. \u201cI know this is nuts\u2014I wish I\u2019d been there with him. I wish it had been me instead of him.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head. \u201cNo. Oh, Jesus, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a family. He should be with them. You just have no idea the kind of man he was\u2014he took loyalty to the next level. I could always count on Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe counted on you, too. He asked you to look out for his wife...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have had to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, you did for Matt what he would have done for you.\u201d</p><p>Paul was reflective for a few moments realizing that this woman he\u2019d been out with a few times, slept with a couple of times on a mutually agreed to \u201cfriends with privileges\u201d status, could bring him this degree of comfort and understanding. \u201cI owe you, Terri,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much I needed to talk to someone about this.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cMen,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cAll that stoicism wrecks your stomach. And usually causes migraines.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her, feeling almost human. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a migraine, but I think my headache\u2019s letting up. For the first time in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook around,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s only one other couple in here, and they\u2019re eating. Let\u2019s get out of here before they start putting the chairs upside down on the tables and mopping the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve put you through enough. And thanks. For listening.\u201d</p><p>When he walked her up the stairs to her second floor apartment, she turned and asked, \u201cWould you like to come in?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head immediately. Terri had done a lot for him tonight, just giving him a place to unload. He wasn\u2019t about to take advantage of that. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. But thanks.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him. She pulled on his hand, drawing him into the apartment. \u201cI\u2019d better not,\u201d he said again, but he said it more softly. And when the door closed, he found his hands were on her waist, his mouth seeking her mouth. And just like the last time he\u2019d been with her, she was up on her toes to reach him, circling his neck with her arms, leaning in to him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said against her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m all screwed up. Tell me no.\u201d</p><p>She pressed against him, tonguing his lips apart. \u201cI would hate doing that.\u201d</p><p>And he was gone. Brain freeze took over. He had no judgment, no willpower. He was all raw need and pain and gratitude. This was as unburdened as he\u2019d felt in months and he was weak from having carried that grievous load for so long. Before a whole minute had passed, he had Terri down on the couch, kissing her, touching her, hearing her say, yes, yes, yes, yes.</p><p>He had one moment of sanity before he slipped his hand under her knit shirt. \u201cTerri, this isn\u2019t a good idea...I didn\u2019t call you for this...I didn\u2019t plan on this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, either,\u201d she whispered, letting her eyes fall closed. \u201cGod, I missed you.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s brain took a hike. He was all physical sensation. He was hard; she was soft. He was desperate, she was hot and willing, and beneath him she seemed as needy as he felt. He ground against her, her bare breast in his hand, his tongue licking its way along her neck. Her hands were on his belt buckle, then his zipper; his hands were tugging at her clothes while she squirmed and moaned. His lips were on her nipple; her hand wrapped around him and he almost lost it. He grabbed for his pocket, pulled an old condom from his wallet and, in a hoarse, desperate whisper he asked, \u201cYou have your side covered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pill, remember?\u201d she answered breathlessly. \u201cOh God, oh God, oh God.\u201d</p><p>Paul felt his pulse slow just slightly. The gentleman in him had to be sure she wasn\u2019t left hanging so he took a moment, slid a finger along that erogenous knot in her very center while his lips tugged at her breast and when her sighs turned into near cries, he entered her, pumped his hips, waited for pleasure to lock her hips against him and steal her breath away, and he let months of misery spill out of him.</p><p>The first thing he felt, while he panted and tried to catch his breath, was overwhelming relief. Basic, primal, physical relief, as potent as a narcotic. The next thing he felt was regret. He shouldn\u2019t have done that. Even though they had an understanding he could sense that she cared about him. Why else would she listen to him with such sensitivity; draw him inside and welcome this encounter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he loved someone else.</p><p>Haggerty, you are a brainless fool! he thought to himself.</p><p>But he put a hand against the hair at her temple and brushed it back over her ear while she drifted slowly back to earth and her eyes opened. \u201cOkay?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She nodded and smiled. \u201cGod, I missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>He gently kissed her lips. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let that happen. I\u2019m too messed up. But thank you.\u201d</p><p>She put a palm against his cheek. \u201cMy pleasure,\u201d she said softly, smiling.</p><p>He held his weight off her and even though he felt stupid and guilty, he managed to smile at her. When a respectable length of time had passed, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t stay. I\u2019d better get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But maybe it won\u2019t be six months until you call me again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be,\u201d he said. He would call her again, take her out for a drink, and try to explain that even though he didn\u2019t have any reason to be optimistic, his heart was tied up elsewhere. And as long as that was the case, it was wrong for him to be intimate with Terri. She was a good person. She deserved better.</p><p>One</p><p>V anessa Rutledge stood in front of her husband\u2019s grave, her coat pulled tightly around her against the crisp March breeze, red hair billowing in the wind. \u201cI know this is going to seem like a strange request\u2014but I just don\u2019t know who else to ask. Matt, you know I love you, that I\u2019ll always love you, that I see you in your son\u2019s eyes every day. But, darling, I\u2019m going to love again, and I need your blessing. If I have that, I\u2019d like you to give the man who is to be my future a little nudge. Let him know it\u2019s all right. Please? Let him know he\u2019s so much more than\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa!\u201d</p><p>Her father was standing out on the deck behind the house holding the baby away from himself, like he\u2019d just pooped on his mess dress. It was past time to leave. Little Matt had been born six weeks ago and this morning they were both seeing Mel Sheridan for their first checkups since his birth. Her father, retired general Walt Booth, was acting as chauffeur so that he could watch the baby while Vanessa had her exam.</p><p>\u201cComing, Dad!\u201d she called. She looked back at the grave. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a real conversation about this later,\u201d she told the headstone. She blew a long kiss in that direction and hurried down the little hill, past the stable and up to the house.</p> <p>The last place Vanessa ever expected to find herself was in a tiny mountain town of six hundred. When her father chose this property a couple of years before his retirement from the Army, she and Matt had taken a look at it. Matt fell in love with it at once. \u201cWhen I go,\u201d he had said, \u201cplant me on that little hill, under that tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d she had laughed, slapping his arm, neither of them realizing how prophetic his words would be.</p><p>There was a time, years before she met Matt, that Vanni had envisioned herself as a high-powered news anchor; using her degree in communications. She decided to take a year before pursuing an eighty-hour-a-week career path and, on a whim, went to work as a flight attendant. One year turned into five because she loved the job, the travel, the people. She\u2019d still been working for the airline when Matt left for Iraq. It was her loneliness and advancing pregnancy that had sent her packing to Virgin River. She had thought it would be temporary\u2014she\u2019d have the baby, wait for her husband\u2019s return from war and move on to his next assignment with him. Instead Matt was brought here, to that little hill with the tree on it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t cry as much anymore, though she missed him; missed the laughter, the long, late-night talks. Missed having someone hold her, whisper to her.</p><p>Walt had the diaper bag slung over his shoulder and was headed for the car. \u201cVanessa, you spend too much time talking to that grave. We should\u2019ve put him somewhere else. Out of sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d she said, lifting a curious eyebrow, the corner of her mouth twitching. \u201cMatt hasn\u2019t been complaining that I\u2019m bothering him, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot funny,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou worry too much,\u201d she told her dad, taking the baby from him to put him in the car seat. \u201cI\u2019m not brooding. There are some things no one but Matt should hear. And gee, he\u2019s so handy...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVanessa! For God\u2019s sake!\u201d He took a breath. \u201cYou need girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cI have plenty of girlfriends.\u201d She had lots of girlfriends from flying days and, even though they didn\u2019t live nearby, they were great about visiting and staying in touch, giving her every opportunity to talk about Matt, about grief, then about the baby and recovery. \u201cYou\u2019ll be happy to know Nikki\u2019s coming up for the weekend,\u201d she said. \u201cA girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Walt hefted himself into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing a lot of Nikki lately. Either she can\u2019t stay away from the new baby or things aren\u2019t going so well with her and that...that...\u201d Walt couldn\u2019t seem to finish.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t stay away from the baby and no, things aren\u2019t going well with Craig. I smell a split coming,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cI never liked him,\u201d Walt said with a grunt.</p><p>\u201cNo one likes him. He\u2019s an ass,\u201d Vanni said. Her best friend, too sweet for her own good, wanted a husband and children, but instead was stuck with a live-in arrangement that had gone flat years ago, leaving her almost as alone as Vanni.</p><p>Vanni had other friends besides fellow flight attendants. She\u2019d begun to grow close to some of the women in town\u2014her midwife, Mel Sheridan; Paige, who worked alongside her husband in the only bar and grill in town; Brie, Mel\u2019s sister-in-law. Still, there were some things only Matt would understand.</p><p>When you live in a place like Virgin River where the doctor\u2019s office only makes appointments on Wednesdays, it\u2019s a pretty good bet there won\u2019t be any waiting around. Sure enough, Mel was standing in the reception area right inside the door waiting for them to arrive. Her face lit up in delight as they walked in and she immediately reached for the baby. \u201cOoooh, come heeeere,\u201d she sang. \u201cLet me look at you!\u201d She lifted him as if weighing him. Then she cuddled him close. \u201cHe\u2019s looking good, Vanni. Getting nice and fat on the breast.\u201d She looked at Walt. \u201cHow\u2019s Grandpa doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpa could use more sleep,\u201d Walt grumbled.</p><p>Vanessa made a face. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason in the world he has to get up. He certainly can\u2019t help me nurse the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wake up, that\u2019s all. And if I\u2019m up and Vanni\u2019s up, I might as well see if she needs anything.\u201d</p><p>Mel smiled at him. \u201cThat\u2019s a good grandpa,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be sleeping through the night before you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did David sleep through the night?\u201d Vanni asked of Mel\u2019s one-year-old.</p><p>\u201cThe first time or the last time?\u201d Mel asked. \u201cYou might not want to ask that\u2014we have sleeping issues at our house. And now Jack lets him in the bed with us. Take my advice, don\u2019t start that!\u201d</p><p>Vanessa peered at Mel\u2019s growing tummy. David had just turned a year and their second baby was due in May. \u201cI hope you have a really big bed,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere will be plenty of room when I kick Jack out of it. Come on\u2014let\u2019s look at Mattie first and take care of his shots.\u201d Mel carried the baby back to the exam room with Vanessa following behind.</p><p>Mel had delivered little Matt right in Vanessa\u2019s bedroom and their bond had grown deep and strong. It didn\u2019t take long to determine the baby was at a good weight and in excellent health. \u201cI\u2019ll take him out to Walt while you get into a gown, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>A few minutes later Mel was back. \u201cYour dad took the baby over to Jack\u2019s for a cup of coffee. And some male bonding, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Vanni had taken her place on the exam table, and Mel checked her heart, blood pressure, and got her in position for a pelvic. \u201cEverything looks great. You had a wonderful delivery, Vanni\u2014you\u2019re in excellent shape. And boy, did you lose weight quickly. Isn\u2019t breast-feeding a miracle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not back in my old jeans yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re close. Go ahead, sit up,\u201d Mel said, offering a hand. \u201cAnything we should talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of things. Can I ask you something personal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can always ask,\u201d Mel said while writing in the chart.</p><p>\u201cI know that before you married Jack, you were widowed...\u201d</p><p>Mel stopped writing. She closed the chart and looked at Vanni with a sympathetic smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been expecting this conversation,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow long was it?\u201d Vanni asked, and Mel knew exactly what she was referring to.</p><p>\u201cI met Jack nine months after my husband\u2019s death. I married him six months later. And if you confer with the town historian and gossips, you\u2019ll learn that I was at least three months pregnant at the time. Closer to four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a town historian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout six hundred of them,\u201d Mel said with a laugh. \u201cIf you have anything you\u2019d like to keep secret, you should consider moving to another town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt\u2019s only been dead a few months, but he\u2019s been gone almost a year...Mel, he wasn\u2019t on a business trip. He was in combat, out of touch. I talked to him a total of three times, saw his face once on live video cam. The letters were short and sparse. It\u2019s been a really long time since\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mel touched Vanni\u2019s knee. \u201cThere\u2019s no rule of thumb on this, Vanessa. Everything I\u2019ve read, and I\u2019ve read a lot about widowhood, says that when people enter new relationships relatively soon after losing a spouse, it indicates they had happiness in their marriage. Being married was a good experience for them.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know for sure I was pregnant when Matt left for Iraq last May. I\u2019m not thinking about another marriage, of course,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cBut I am thinking about\u2014Well, what I\u2019m thinking is that I don\u2019t want to be alone forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you shouldn\u2019t be alone forever. You have a lot of life to live.\u201d</p><p>Vanni smiled. \u201cShould I be thinking about birth control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about that. You wouldn\u2019t want to be as unprepared as your midwife. Especially with having a baby to take care of. Believe me.\u201d She took a breath and ran a hand over her big belly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let myself think ahead! I remember when my sister said, \u2018I know widows who have remarried, and are happy.\u2019 I almost took her head off. I was appalled. I wasn\u2019t at all hopeful life could go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure went on for you,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cBoy howdy. I came here absolutely determined to live out my days lonely and miserable, but that damn Jack\u2014he ambushed me. I think I fell in love with him the minute I met him, but I fought it. As though I might somehow be unfaithful to my husband\u2019s memory by moving on, which was absurd. I had the kind of husband who would have wanted me to have love in my life, and I bet you did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t send a man off to war without talking a few things through\u2014my parents taught me that. One of the first ways Tom and I figured out the general was headed for a possible deployment was when the paperwork came out. Wills, trusts, etcetera. Not just in case something happened to him, but what if he was away in some jungle or desert war zone and something happened to Mom?\u201d She smiled a bit wistfully. \u201cMatt didn\u2019t dwell on the worst-case scenario, but he was quick and to the point. He said I wasn\u2019t the type to wallow and he\u2019d be disappointed in me if I did. He had a few requests\u2014where he wanted to be buried, what to do with his favorite personal items, to make sure his parents got regular visits especially if we had children. And\u2014if a good man showed his face, I was not to hesitate.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMy requests of him were almost identical.\u201d She straightened. \u201cIf I\u2019m lucky enough to run into another man half as wonderful as Matt, I should be ready.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbsolutely. It\u2019s not at all impossible, even in little old Virgin River. Let\u2019s get you something reliable while you\u2019re considering all this. You want a pill you can take while breast-feeding? Can I hook you up with a diaphragm or IUD? Have you given the options any thought?\u201d</p><p>Vanni smiled gratefully. Of course she\u2019d thought about it. \u201cYes. IUD please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go over the models,\u201d Mel said. Then she smiled. \u201cBy the way, you\u2019re all cleared for intercourse. Should you find...\u201d</p> <p>Vanni laughed. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou have good judgment. Make sure there\u2019s a condom involved. We don\u2019t want the transmission of any\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have good judgment,\u201d Vanni repeated. \u201cAnd extremely good taste.\u201d</p><p>There was a man on Vanessa\u2019s mind, he was the reason she\u2019d found herself imploring Matt for help and blessings. Matt\u2019s best friend; her best friend. Paul.</p><p>He spent months in Virgin River, supporting and comforting her, spending Christmas away from his parents, brothers and their families. They spent a lot of time talking about Matt; crying about Matt, lost in hours of sentimental remembering. Without Paul\u2019s strength, she\u2019d never have gotten through the worst of it. He was her rock.</p> <p>Her relationship with Paul went back much further, of course. It wasn\u2019t as though they became friends because of Matt\u2019s death. In fact, that night long ago when she met Matt, it had been Paul across the room who\u2019d first caught her eye. He was so tall, his legs so long and hands so big, it was hard for him not to stand out in a crowd. There was that willful, sandy hair that had to be kept short because it would defy any kind of styling. Not that Paul was the kind of man to fuss with his hair\u2014it was obvious even from a distance that he stuck to basics. It was his masculinity she noticed; he looked like a lumberjack who\u2019d cleaned up to go into town. He had an engaging smile; one tooth in front was just a little crooked and he had a dimple on the left cheek. Heavy brown brows, deep chocolate eyes\u2014details she discovered a bit later, of course. She hadn\u2019t even noticed Matt...</p><p>But it was Matt who put the rush on her, swept her off her feet, made her laugh, made her blush. While Paul hung back, shy and silent, Matt charmed her to her very bones. And shortly after the charm, he made her desire him madly, love him deeply. He was hardly a consolation prize\u2014he was one of the best men in the world. And a devoted husband, so in love with her.</p><p>She loved Paul before Matt\u2019s death, grew to love him more deeply afterward. When little Mattie was born, she said to Paul, \u201cI will never love anyone but Matt.\u201d But as the weeks passed she realized that she didn\u2019t have to stop loving Matt any more than Paul should. Matt would be with them both forever. And it was like the natural order of things that Paul should step in now. But there was no indication from him that he felt anything more than a special friendship. She had no doubt that Paul loved her, loved little Matt, but it didn\u2019t appear to be the kind of love that could warm her on cold nights.</p><p>She\u2019d called him several times since he\u2019d returned to Grants Pass; polite and entertaining conversations about the baby, the town and his friends here, about her dad and brother, even sometimes about Matt.</p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2019s gained a pound and a half already,\u201d she told him. \u201cHe\u2019s already changed so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho does he look like?\u201d Paul asked. \u201cIs his hair still dark or does he have a patch of fire on his head, like his mom?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStill just a little Matt,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you to see him. Hold him.\u201d Hold me!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to try to get down there.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t visited yet. And he never betrayed any longing. Not a whiff of desire came through those phone lines.</p><p>She felt like a fool for even wanting him. But there was no denying it\u2014she missed him so much. And not the way a young widow misses having a man in her life. The way a woman longs for a man who stirs her, moves her.</p><p>When Mel walked Vanni out to the clinic\u2019s waiting room, Vanni spied her younger brother\u2019s girlfriend waiting there. \u201cBrenda!\u201d Vanni said, going to her, giving her a hug. \u201cI guess if there are only appointments on Wednesdays, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll run into all your friends here,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Brenda shrugged, blushing a little.</p><p>\u201cI have to rescue my dad before he runs into a messy diaper. He\u2019s got the baby at Jack\u2019s. I\u2019ll see you later\u2014probably tonight at dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Brenda said. \u201cLater.\u201d</p> <p>Vanni blew out the door and Brenda sank into her chair. The waiting room had been the old house\u2019s front room and was decorated exactly so. Heavy cream-colored velvet draperies covered the front windows. They were pulled back with sashes and always remained open. An ancient sofa and settee, upholstered in burgundy velvet, were flanked by two wing chairs with curved wooden legs. The fabric on the chairs was yellow brocade that had long ago lost its luster. A few Gisele chairs with cane seats were spotted around the room, which, itself, was rarely full. There was only Mel and Doc Mullins to see patients, so unless someone wandered in, the appointments were spaced comfortably apart.</p><p>Brenda had an elbow on her knee and her forehead rested in her hand. \u201cWhew,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cOf course I\u2019d have to run into Vanessa. Crap.\u201d</p><p>Mel grabbed Brenda\u2019s chart. She just chuckled and went to her, pulling her to her feet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. Come on, let\u2019s check you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s Tommy\u2019s sister! What if she asks me why I was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenda, Brenda, that\u2019s not going to be a problem.\u201d Mel pulled her along to the exam room. While Brenda stood by the door, Mel stripped off the disposable paper from the exam table and refreshed it. Then she handed Brenda a gown. Mel flipped open the chart and said, \u201cSo\u2014you\u2019re here about concern over heavy periods...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Mel said. \u201cExcept, they\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Brenda said shyly. \u201cI need birth control pills...\u201d She looked down and Mel just lifted her chin with one finger.</p><p>\u201cSure. I know,\u201d Mel said. \u201cBut if Vanessa ever asks you why you were here, you just say you were concerned about your periods and I checked you, told you everything was just fine. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t talk about patients\u2019 business,\u201d Mel said. \u201cPut on the gown. We\u2019ll have a checkup. We\u2019ll talk about why you\u2019re really here. And Brenda\u2014everything is going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m doing this,\u201d she said. \u201cShe thinks it\u2019s my periods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mel said, but she knew Sue Carpenter was pretty sharp. Chances were good she knew exactly what was going on. After all, Tommy and Brenda had been steadies since the start of school and there was no question they were real serious. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in five,\u201d Mel said, leaving the room.</p><p>Few seventeen-year-old girls felt comfortable discussing birth control with even the closest of mothers. When Mel returned and Brenda was gowned and ready, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll need to update your pap and, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to do a check on you for STDs to be sure there\u2019s nothing we should treat. Should we talk about emergency birth control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you recently had unprotected intercourse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cThing is, Tommy won\u2019t come near me without my own birth control, even though he has...you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCondoms,\u201d Mel supplied.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He says that\u2019s not good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, God bless him,\u201d Mel said. This darling girl, a gifted student who would very likely get lots of offers for full-ride scholarships, had been the victim of a sexual assault less than a year ago, before Tom had moved here. She\u2019d gone to a beer party in the woods with a bunch of teenagers, intending to have one sneaky beer, and three months later, discovered she was pregnant without having the first idea how that could have happened. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, Brenda had had a raging case of Chlamydia, which may have contributed to a spontaneous miscarriage.</p><p>Mel performed her examination, did some tests, gave her a three-month supply of contraceptives and a prescription and said, \u201cI want to commend you for taking care of your health, Brenda. I know it can be scary to ask for this kind of help when you\u2019re young. But you\u2019re wise to take precautions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if my mom asks you about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably won\u2019t, but if she does, I\u2019ll tell her that you\u2019re doing just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019ll do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I\u2019ve gotten very, very good at not telling things. Ask Jack,\u201d she added with a laugh. \u201cYou can start taking these right now, but they won\u2019t be effective for two weeks. Try to remember to take them at the same time every day\u2014like right before bed or as soon as you get up in the morning. That will increase the reliability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going away, you know,\u201d Brenda said a little emotionally. \u201cRight after graduation he goes into basic, then West Point.\u201d</p><p>Mel put a hand against the girl\u2019s soft, pretty hair. \u201cFirst of all, you wouldn\u2019t want any other kind of boyfriend\u2014he\u2019s an overachiever and will be a huge success. Cream of the crop. Second, just because you have pills doesn\u2019t mean you have to do anything that you\u2019re not ready for. With me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be back for leave and vacations. There will be lots of letters between you\u2014wonderful letters.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again but said, \u201cE-mails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as good. These pills are for your health and safety, Brenda. You don\u2019t have to send him off with something to remember. Don\u2019t be pressured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not. I understand what you\u2019re saying,\u201d she said softly. \u201cTom would never pressure me. Besides, I love him.\u201d</p><p>Mel smiled. \u201cHow nice for you. He\u2019s a very special young man. And you, my dear, are a very special young woman. You\u2019re completely in charge of your body\u2014always remember that.\u201d</p><p>Nikki Jorgensen pulled up in front of the Booth ranch and gave the horn a toot before getting out. When she let herself into the house, Vanni was sitting on the floor beside the baby. Little Matt was lying on a small baby quilt with toys he was entirely too young to enjoy spread around him.</p><p>\u201cHurry up,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cHe\u2019s smiling!\u201d</p><p>Nikki threw her purse in a chair and knelt on the floor opposite Vanni. They were so unalike\u2014Vanni being a statuesque redhead and Nikki small and dark, her black hair falling down her back almost to her waist in a straight, silky sheath. Vanni was bold; Nikki was quiet and hated confrontation. Nikki liked to say that while she was studying the latest hairstyles in high school, Vanni, the military brat, was learning to pack a house in six hours and navigate Customs in foreign countries.</p><p>They spent a few minutes making faces at the baby until Vanni finally said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell Paul he\u2019s smiling for real.\u201d</p><p>And that alone plunged them into silence. \u201cHave you heard from Paul?\u201d Nikki finally asked in a gentle voice.</p><p>Vanni shook her head, looking away. \u201cWell, I call him. A couple of times every week. But he\u2019s only called here once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Vanni,\u201d Nikki said, sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. He\u2019s probably relieved he doesn\u2019t have any obligation to the Widow Rutledge anymore...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not it,\u201d Nikki said, giving Vanni\u2019s thick, red mane a stroke.</p><p>\u201cA couple of months ago it never occurred to me I\u2019d have feelings for him. I mean, these kind of feelings. I thought of him as my ballast, my rock. And then slowly, he started to mean more to me than that. Since he left...I miss him so much. And not just because he was a supportive friend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho more likely for you to be attracted to than someone who misses Matt as much as you do? Who loves little Mattie as much as Matt would himself? Besides, it\u2019s not like you just met him\u2014he\u2019s been around since the day you met Matt! You know him better than anyone. You certainly don\u2019t have to wonder what kind of man he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just afraid...I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to really let go of Matt.\u201d</p><p>Nikki laughed. \u201cVanni, you don\u2019t have to let go of Matt any more than Paul does. He\u2019ll be part of you and Paul forever.\u201d</p> <p>Vanni gave her a thankful smile, lifting a tawny brow. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking lately. It\u2019s not like it has to be a choice, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how are things with you and Craig?\u201d</p><p>Nikki\u2019s smile vanished. \u201cThe same. Not good. I gave him an ultimatum. Commitment or we\u2019re over. He just keeps saying he needs time. But how much time? It\u2019s been five years. He knows I want a family, and my clock isn\u2019t standing still.\u201d</p><p>Vanni shook her head, doubtful. \u201cHe\u2019ll never give you up,\u201d Vanni said, but truthfully, she feared Nikki would never leave him even if he didn\u2019t give her a tenth of what she needed.</p> <p>Nikki lifted her chin. \u201cOh, yeah? You a betting woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki, do you mean it this time? Really?\u201d</p><p>Nikki touched the baby\u2019s foot. \u201cI\u2019m not going through life without at least a shot at this,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m selfish. I want it all. And things have been nonnegotiable with Craig on all of it.\u201d</p><p>Paul had been back in Grants Pass for just over six weeks. He\u2019d had that evening with Terri and had promised her he\u2019d be in touch. When she came to him at work and asked if he could sneak away for a conversation, he figured it was about the fact that he hadn\u2019t called as he\u2019d promised.</p><p>But no.</p><p>He folded his long legs up into her little Toyota parked in front of his office and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Through some nervous tears, she explained that she was pregnant and hadn\u2019t been with anyone but him.</p> <p>\u201cPregnant?\u201d he repeated stunned. \u201cPregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cIt happened that night after you got back to town. You remember. It was a pretty intense night. You can\u2019t have forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in the world did that happen? You said you were on the pill. I wore a condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, sniffing. \u201cIt\u2019s probably my fault. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fault?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a boyfriend in so long, I got a little sloppy with the pills, missing them sometimes. Your call\u2014it came as a surprise. I hadn\u2019t heard from you in such a long time and I couldn\u2019t pass up seeing you. But you had the condom and I was sure we\u2019d be okay...I don\u2019t know what went wrong. It must have been me missing pills, you having a faulty condom...I can\u2019t think of any other explanation...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, man,\u201d he said. He took a deep breath. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, getting a grip on his panic. \u201cOkay, tell me what you need,\u201d he said, taking her hand and holding it in both of his.</p><p>\u201cAny possibility marriage might come to mind?\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t even have to think about it. There was someone else; there\u2019d been someone else for a long, long time. \u201cGod, Terri, we can\u2019t get married. What did you call us\u2014friends with benefits? We\u2019re consenting adults who like and respect each other and that\u2019s a lot, but at the same time, not enough. You\u2019re important to me, but we don\u2019t have the kind of relationship that would get us married. Keep us married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little beside the point right now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really know each other. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know each other well enough that I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take this to mean you\u2019ve decided you want to have the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost thirty,\u201d she said, bristling. \u201cI\u2019m not getting rid of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, good,\u201d Paul said, relieved in spite of common sense telling him this could be taken care of; it could disappear. He did not want to be in this position, but he didn\u2019t want this baby erased, either. \u201cI can help financially. I can do my best to support you emotionally. I swear, I\u2019ll stand by you. But, Terri, anything more than that would be a mistake for both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, tears springing to her eyes.</p><p>He put an arm around her and held her against his shoulder as much as he could, given the tight space in her car. \u201cLots of reasons, starting with, before anything happened between us, we had a conversation about us\u2014neither of us was looking for anything serious. We\u2019ve been together, what? Three times in a year? Four? God, I\u2019m sorry, Terri, but the night this happened, that\u2019s the closest we\u2019ve ever been, and that happened because I was messed up and you were sweet enough to give me an ear. Honey, we\u2019re just not in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m not?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken once in the last six months. If you had those kind of feelings, I never suspected.\u201d He tightened his arm around her. \u201cTerri, you\u2019re so special and wonderful. But here we are, two people who can go six months without talking, without seeing each other.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI knew that night was a mistake. I went too deep into my feelings and you got too attached. But it\u2019s just not the real thing. It was my crisis, your compassion that got us where we are today. Marrying you now would only get in the way of you finding what you really need. And believe me, you don\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d</p><p>Selfishly he thought, what am I going to do? \u201cWhatever you want to do, I\u2019ll help in every way I can. I\u2019m sorry, but you deserve a husband who loves you as much as you love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m having your baby!\u201d she said desperately.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I can, Terri, except marriage. It wouldn\u2019t last. It could make us enemies and we have to do better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I be such a terrible choice for a wife?\u201d she asked pitifully.</p><p>There was absolutely nothing wrong with Terri, nothing. The problem was with him. He found Terri attractive, desirable, funny and sweet, which was how he\u2019d ended up with her at the time Vanni was married to his best friend. He\u2019d have given anything to fall in love. When he thought of Vanni his blood pressure shot up and his heart pounded. When he thought of Terri, a smile came to his lips because she was so cute, because she made him laugh and because she was just plain good people. When he thought of Vanni, he was filled with fear and lust and ridiculous hope. He liked Terri; he was totally crazy for Vanni and had been for years. He didn\u2019t know why. He suspected an evil curse made him want something he could never have.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair to Terri; it wasn\u2019t right, nor was it the easy way. But it was what it was. His testosterone kicked up when he was with Terri because she was seductive, pretty, available and he was alone. He was just a man; sometimes it was nice to have a woman in his life. Calling Terri after Matt\u2019s death when the only woman in the world he wanted to be with was Vanni had been a critical mistake. But he\u2019d been so desperate for understanding, for friendship.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll make someone a wonderful wife, when you find the right man,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the guy, but I\u2019ll do whatever I have to do to be a part of this, Terri. I won\u2019t run, I won\u2019t hide. And God, Terri, I\u2019m sorry. I sure didn\u2019t mean for this to happen.\u201d</p><p>Joe Benson had been designing houses for Haggerty Construction for about ten years, and he was a little worried about his friend Paul. He\u2019d seen Paul on a couple of job sites and they talked about getting together for a beer, but Paul had been evasive, distracted, morose and probably depressed. Small wonder\u2014Paul had been through a lot with Matt\u2019s death. Joe suspected a pressure cooker. So he did what a good friend does\u2014he pushed. It was time for Paul to let it out, so he could move on.</p><p>Joe went to a small, dark, quiet bar and waited for Paul to meet him. Joe had picked the place\u2014somewhere a man could talk privately about the stuff that was eating his gut. He looked at his watch several times, wondering if Paul would be a no-show. Joe had a beer and was thinking about either trying the cell phone or just leaving when Paul finally lumbered in, head down, looking like he\u2019d looked for too long now. The man was hurting all over.</p><p>\u201cBeer,\u201d he said to the bartender before he even said hello. \u201cHeineken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Joe said, picking up his almost empty beer. \u201cYou\u2019re in lousy shape.\u201d</p><p>Paul was quiet for a moment, waiting for his beer. When it came he took a long drink before he said, \u201cLousy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I thought maybe if we had a beer together, talked about it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, you don\u2019t want to talk about this, Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness okay?\u201d Joe asked, nibbling around the edges of this situation. Paul\u2019s family business was a good little company that did quality construction. While Matt might\u2019ve been Paul\u2019s best friend since they were kids, Joe had been closest to him since Desert Storm when they joined the same Marine reserve unit. They\u2019d worked together since then and had gone back to Iraq together.</p><p>\u201cBusiness is fine,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the problem.\u201d</p><p>Joe clamped a strong hand on Paul\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re not yourself lately, bud. You\u2019re having trouble moving on after Matt...He wouldn\u2019t want this, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s more than Matt,\u201d Joe said. \u201cI get the feeling something\u2019s really eating you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he asked with a somber laugh. \u201cJesus, you\u2019re psychic.\u201d He took another long drink of his beer.</p><p>\u201cAny chance you could just go ahead and get it out where we can look at it? Because if you\u2019re gonna drink that fast, you\u2019ll leave me in your dust pretty quick.\u201d</p><p>Paul shook his head. \u201cI fucked things up pretty bad, Joe. I got myself in a mess I\u2019m not gonna get out of.\u201d</p><p>Joe stared at him a long moment. Then he banged his glass on the bar and when the bartender came over he said, \u201cGimme another one of these, huh?\u201d While he was waiting for a new brew, he turned to Paul and asked, \u201cYou have any idea how confusing you are right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You should find more stable people to drink with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, until I do...\u201d</p><p>It was a moment before Paul finally said, \u201cI got someone pregnant...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Joe said, stunned. \u201cNo, you\u2019re too smart for that...\u201d</p><p>Paul laughed. \u201cI guess I\u2019m not. Maybe I should sue Trojan, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d Joe said. \u201cOh God. Someone special? I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice girl,\u201d Paul said with a shrug. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t...Aw, man. It was...We aren\u2019t...Shit. It was just one of those things. You know? I\u2019ve known her about a year, but I\u2019ve only been out with her a few times. We really didn\u2019t have anything going on except...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d Joe said again.</p><p>Paul turned toward Joe. \u201cWhile I was in Virgin River last fall I didn\u2019t talk to her once during that time\u2014that\u2019s how casual. I came back here all the time to check on the company, my dad and brothers, but I never even called her. And she didn\u2019t call me. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I came home with my gut in a knot after everything that had happened in Virgin River and I called her. On instinct, probably. And guess what happened?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh damn,\u201d Joe said. \u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are my choices?\u201d Paul asked, hanging his head. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of her, of my kid. What else do you do?\u201d He shook his head sadly. \u201cI want it,\u201d he said. \u201cI know\u2014it\u2019s stupid. I should probably try something, like buying her off or something. Get her to make it go away\u2014but if I have a kid coming, I want a part of that. I\u2019m nuts, right?\u201d</p><p>Joe smiled patiently. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe you\u2019re not nuts about that\u2014but what about the mother? Is she someone you\u2019re going to be able to work with on that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo telling,\u201d he said. \u201cShe wants to get married. I can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m only planning to do this marrying thing once, and then it\u2019s going to be to a girl I love so much I can\u2019t stop myself. If I married this woman, it would really fuck her up, worse than she already is. I can\u2019t fake it\u2014not something like this. I\u2019d be the worst husband. You don\u2019t marry someone that fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big, permanent step,\u201d Joe said. \u201cOnly you know if you can make something like that work. If you can\u2019t, you do the next best thing,\u201d Joe said. \u201cMan up. Take care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I slept with her when I love someone else. Why the hell did I do that? What kind of sorry bastard does that? What was I thinking?\u201d</p><p>At this point in the conversation Joe was completely lost. Paul loved someone? It wasn\u2019t as though men got together and talked about women they had crushes on\u2014they just didn\u2019t. They rarely said how they felt, period. He\u2019d known Paul a long time and there\u2019d been very few women. He was the quiet one; he kept back. Even when they were abroad together, at war, with a lot of tension to unload, Paul never hustled the women.</p><p>The bartender delivered Paul another beer, from which he took a deep drink.</p> <p>\u201cLove someone else?\u201d Joe repeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m such a screwup...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wrong, that\u2019s all. I had no business...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul. You love someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I was a real horseshit best friend for years. Vanni. I just couldn\u2019t help it. I didn\u2019t want it to be that way, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Joe drank a big gulp. He was prepared to help Paul through just about anything, but he never saw this coming. And why hadn\u2019t he? Probably because he\u2019d have done for Paul what Paul did for Matt\u2014stay with the widow through everything. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he finally said. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Paul echoed.</p><p>\u201cVanni?\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded grimly. \u201cYou wanna try to imagine how guilty I feel about that? I tried like hell to talk myself out of it. Sometimes I got damn close. I stayed away from them, you know? Because I could talk to Matt just fine, but if I saw Vanni, my heart wanted to explode...Aw God.\u201d He put his head in his hand. \u201cAnd now I\u2019ve got someone else pregnant. Think I could\u2019ve messed things up any worse?\u201d</p><p>Joe shook his head, but he was thinking\u2014yeah. You could\u2019ve been the dead guy. \u201cYou sure this baby is yours?\u201d Joe asked. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about that,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I decided that was probably wishful thinking on my part. She said there hadn\u2019t been a guy in a long time, which is why she got lazy on the pills. And what did I have? Some poor old condom in the wallet that thought it was never gonna get out of that package. I probably wore a damn hole in it just getting in and out of the truck. Nah, it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re gonna find out for sure before you set up the college fund, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sure. Right now, though, I don\u2019t want to push on her too hard. She\u2019s a wreck\u2014a crying, miserable wreck. If she gets the idea I\u2019m not going to step up\u2014who knows what she might do. I don\u2019t want her to get an abortion just out of fear that I won\u2019t be responsible. I\u2019m just going with the assumption it\u2019s mine, since it most likely is. We\u2019ll sort out the details later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do about Vanni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, what can I do? Vanni\u2019s in a lot of pain right now. You think I could help that pain go away by telling her I\u2019ve loved her since the first second I saw her, but I went ahead and got some other woman I barely know knocked up?\u201d</p><p>Joe smiled in spite of himself. \u201cWe might have to work on your delivery a little bit there, bud. Paul, keep your head here\u2014it\u2019s not like you cheated on Vanni. Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I feel like I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got your feelings all mixed up in guilt and regret, that\u2019s all. You have to let yourself off the hook about Matt, for one thing. The way you feel about Vanni\u2014it never messed with their marriage or your friendship.\u201d</p><p>He slowly turned his eyes toward Joe. \u201cEven though I don\u2019t stand a chance with Vanni, I have to come clean about how I feel. It\u2019s still too soon after Matt. You gotta believe me, I never wanted anything bad to happen to Matt.\u201d</p><p>Joe gripped Paul\u2019s biceps. \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t. But this business with Vanni? You owe it to yourself to know where you stand before you borrow all this trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, hanging his head. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll just try to let me down as easy as she can...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen again, you never know,\u201d Joe said with a shrug. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll go your way for once. In which case, right after she says, \u2018I love you, too,\u2019 you\u2019re gonna have to say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be a father pretty soon.\u2019 Whew.\u201d Joe gave a short, unhappy laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna bite. I think, my friend, your ass is grass. Either way.\u201d</p><p>Paul leveled his gaze at Joe. Then he said, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna need a lot more beer.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>M ike Valenzuela was the Virgin River town constable and, as such, he spent a great deal of time driving the back mountain roads surrounding the town, taking in the lay of the land. It was important to know the people, the structures, the vehicles. There was no better way to identify something unusual. He got out of his Jeep and walked among trees and shrubs for a while, staying mostly out of sight. He came upon a half-buried semi-trailer and metal storage unit that he\u2019d seen before and had been keeping an eye on. There was a generator between the building and the trailer and camouflage netting stretched over the tops, strung between the trees, which identified it as a cannabis operation, but he\u2019d never seen any activity around it. Mike kept his distance\u2014they were sometimes booby trapped.</p><p>This time he happened to see a vehicle departing, and he recognized it\u2014a Ford truck, dark, tinted windows. The driver was known around these parts as an illegal grower.</p><p>This guy had been seen around here a few times in the past couple of years. The bills in his pocket were large and carried the stink of freshly cut marijuana. When Mel had barely arrived in Virgin River, he had hijacked her out to a trailer, to an illegal grow like this one, to deliver a woman in childbirth, in trouble. Not so long after, Jack\u2019s cook Preacher\u2019s wife, Paige, had been abducted by her abusive ex-husband, and this guy had stepped in, whopped him over the head and facilitated Paige\u2019s rescue. But most significant, Mike had seen him just a few months ago meeting a Sheriff\u2019s Department detective in an isolated location. It had been a sheer accident that Mike had seen them. But the two men had probably handpicked the place\u2014Virgin River had a reputation as dope free\u2014there weren\u2019t any illegal growers nearby that Mike or anyone else knew about. It was a good place for a secret meeting.</p><p>Mike decided to check out the trailer. The guy had a relationship of some kind with a cop and Mike wanted to see what he had going on in there. From twenty feet away he could see that the padlock on the semi\u2019s door was left unhitched. Sloppy, was his very first thought. He stepped slowly, carefully, listening for a click, a trip wire. One rule of thumb\u2014growers want to protect their crop from other growers, but really do not want to hurt or kill anyone from law enforcement, not even lowly, nonofficially recognized town constables like Mike. It brings a barrage of cops down on the area, busting up everything that might have otherwise been missed or ignored.</p><p>But Mike saw nothing; no trip wires, so he slipped off the padlock and slowly opened the door. The place was almost empty. There were a few medium-size plants right inside the door, so few he could grow that number legally with a prescription and permit. But, all the equipment was there for a large grow\u2014pots, irrigation tubing, lights, fertilizer. The guy obviously bought what a grower would need for a large operation, but there was no real crop. So, he looked like a grower, but he wasn\u2019t growing.</p><p>Jesus, Mike thought. The guy was a narc. He was either undercover police or a confidential informant. He\u2019d set up something to look like an illegal grow, but it was a ruse. There was only one reason to establish oneself as a grower when you weren\u2019t\u2014to search for other growers.</p><p>It took a long time to form even a nodding acquaintance with other growers, and even when they got friendly, they kept a safe distance unless they were doing business together, and they never showed each other their hidden grows. They spotted each other at the hardware store, the nursery, buying supplies, carrying around bags of chicken shit in the back of pickups. But they didn\u2019t have dinner parties with each other at their grow-sites.</p><p>The other reality was that local law enforcement couldn\u2019t keep up with the illegal crops; their resources and manpower were limited. They let a lot of cases slide when they were too small to make an impact, or to get a conviction. When a call came in about a hairdresser who was driving a Hummer and had a generator behind the house and a couple of windows blacked out, it was pretty obvious what she was doing, but the cops had bigger fish to fry\u2014they were looking for over a thousand plants to press for a conviction or ten thousand plants to drive it into a federal crime, otherwise it was a waste of their precious time.</p><p>So\u2014this guy, planting himself in the area, making himself known as an illegal grower...He must be looking for something. Mike slowly exited the trailer and once outside, looked around cautiously. Then he looked at the padlock. It had obviously been an oversight on the part of his buddy, the guy in the truck. If he didn\u2019t think it would compromise his operation, he\u2019d find him, tell him he understood what was going on and to be more careful. Instead he removed the lock and pocketed it. He\u2019d think about all this for a while before taking any action.</p><p>Paul sat in a small Italian restaurant in Grants Pass, staring into a cup of coffee, waiting. He looked up to see Terri enter the restaurant and he frowned slightly; there was no reason not to be attracted to her. She was a beautiful, tenderhearted girl. She had a very attractive figure that would soon blossom with motherhood.</p><p>When they connected eyes, he smiled and began to rise. Yes, she was a lovely girl, but she just didn\u2019t do to his blood pressure what Vanni did to him. The chemistry between them was nice, but it wasn\u2019t explosive.</p><p>He held a chair out for her to sit down. \u201cEverything all right, Paul?\u201d she asked a bit nervously.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cFine. We haven\u2019t talked since last week. I apologize for that\u2014I meant to get in touch sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we should have a conversation. I think the shock and tears kept us from getting anything resolved the last time we saw each other.\u201d He reached across the table and gave her hand a pat. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we could have avoided that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResolved?\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t really explained what you think I can do for you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cI just found out myself, so I haven\u2019t given it much thought, either. I mean, the best-case scenario didn\u2019t work out for me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He held his tongue, not willing to go there again, but he looked down uncomfortably. Even if things never worked out with Vanni, which was what he feared, he didn\u2019t have the kind of passion for Terri that was required to take on marriage\u2014it would rob them both. Yet, he was going to end up committing most of a lifetime to her because of the child. \u201cHow about insurance benefits? Financial obligations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a good job, Paul. My benefits will see me through the pregnancy, though I haven\u2019t told my boss yet. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the kind of help I\u2019m going to need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>A waiter came to their table, offered menus, took drink orders, disappeared again.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Paul said. \u201cTake a look, see what you feel like for lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, ah, not real hungry right now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, you have to eat, Terri. You\u2019re supporting more than one body. One of them\u2019s growing.\u201d And then he smiled kindly. \u201cI know\u2014I\u2019m a little nervous, too. I think we\u2019re going to have to try to get past the jitters if we\u2019re going to make this work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, looking into her menu. She lifted it up so he couldn\u2019t see her face and he noticed a movement behind the menu that suggested she wiped her eyes before lowering it again. \u201cI\u2019ll just have a salad,\u201d she said. And then the waiter was beside them with water and iced tea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have lasagna,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd bread. And bring the lady a minestrone soup with her salad.\u201d When the waiter had gone he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Terri. This will get easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told your parents yet?\u201d</p><p>She looked down. \u201cI told my mom. She and my dad are divorced and I haven\u2019t had that much contact with him.\u201d She looked up shyly. \u201cShe\u2019d like to meet you sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, sitting back in his chair. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve had some time to sort things out a little, huh?\u201d And she nodded. This woman was a far cry from the little pistol he\u2019d met a year ago. She was subdued, self-conscious and submissive today. He didn\u2019t know her well but, at the moment, it was as if he didn\u2019t know her at all. As much as he wished this wasn\u2019t happening, he couldn\u2019t help but see it was harder for her than him. She\u2019d been so good to him; he hated that he\u2019d hurt her.</p> <p>\u201cHave you told your parents?\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I might hold off on that a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they freak out?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled again. \u201cOh, I think it\u2019ll surprise them. In fact, maybe I should brush up on my CPR.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw,\u201d she said, a hand going to her tummy.</p><p>Paul immediately reached for her other hand and held it supportively. \u201cTerri, you don\u2019t have to worry that they\u2019d be a problem for you. My parents are real decent people. Even if they were thoroughly disappointed in me, they\u2019d treat you and your child with kindness. Respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur child,\u201d she said softly after a moment of silence.</p><p>He was quiet, not responding to that. He might get there eventually, but he wasn\u2019t there yet. He kept thinking of this as her baby or his baby but not their baby. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the doctor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust once, to confirm what I already knew. I\u2019m not very far along, you know.\u201d</p><p>He knew exactly how far along. Almost to the minute. \u201cAnd you\u2019re due...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNovember. The twentieth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy with the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s nice.\u201d Terri shrugged. \u201cShe was recommended...\u201d</p><p>To Paul\u2019s great relief, the food arrived. He waited for Terri to take a couple of bites before he started on his; he found himself watching her to be sure she was eating. They sat in uncomfortable silence. After a few minutes, he pulled a card out of his shirt pocket, turned it over to be sure it was the right one and slid it across the table. \u201cMy home, work and cell phone numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cI have your home phone, but I don\u2019t know where you work. Secretary, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cLegal secretary. I\u2019m thinking about applying for a paralegal course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s great,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was thinking about that, before...\u201d</p><p>He liked that she had goals for herself, something to look forward to, since he wasn\u2019t giving her much in that department. And she would improve her earning potential, he thought. Because she was going to be a working mother. Or...Maybe she shouldn\u2019t have to work. His head started to spin. \u201cListen, it\u2019s hard to make long-term plans when you have a short-term complications, but if that\u2019s something you really want to do, don\u2019t give up on the idea. Not yet. Things always seem to work out the way they\u2019re supposed to. You\u2019d be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now it\u2019s a little hard to figure things out. Things like that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other things have you concerned?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I live in a one bedroom, upstairs apartment. It\u2019s a nice apartment\u2014you\u2019ve been there. Single women like the upstairs\u2014it\u2019s safer. Fewer means of entry, for one thing. But single mothers probably have a hard time with things like that. Babies come with a lot of gear. You know?\u201d</p><p>Stroller, diaper bag, car seat, swing, Port-a-Crib, etcetera. He\u2019d spent years watching his brothers tromp into their parents\u2019 house, hauling all the baby stuff. The stairs to her apartment were steep. She should live in a house, he thought. In a safe neighborhood. He thought he felt a migraine coming on. The first one of his life.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any savings,\u201d she said. \u201cI make a decent living, not a great one. My office has paid leave for six weeks and optional time off without pay up to six months. I already feel like six weeks isn\u2019t enough. Not for a new baby. And then\u2014what about child care? I haven\u2019t even felt this baby move\u2014and I\u2019m already worried about leaving him with some stranger. Or her. Him or her.\u201d</p><p>Paul smiled kindly. \u201cTry not to worry about things like that yet, Terri. You\u2019re not going to have to make those decisions alone. Don\u2019t let it keep you up nights. I\u2019ll be pitching in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPitching in? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, financially and, hopefully, with child care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelping me pay for childcare? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with actual child care,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou thinking of sticking your mother with a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty good with babies,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking of having my time with him. Or her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cThanks. That\u2019s nice of you.\u201d</p><p>Nice of me, he thought shamefully. She was talking like she expected to go it alone if he wouldn\u2019t marry her, and that almost made his cheeks flame. He had at least as much responsibility here as she did. She might\u2019ve been lazy about those pills, but he\u2019d used a condom he\u2019d been carrying around for months, rubbing it thinner every time he slid into a chair. \u201cI told you\u2014you\u2019re not in this all alone. Can you think of anything I can do to help right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell the truth, just having you show a little interest helps a lot. Moral support, you know.\u201d And then for the first time since they sat down, she smiled.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cThere it is. I know you don\u2019t think you have that much to smile about right now, especially where I\u2019m concerned. I\u2019ll do whatever I can. It\u2019ll help if you tell me what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now? I want my baby to have a father. A good father. I just need someone to care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care about what\u2019s happening with you and the baby. I\u2019m kind of clumsy with words, Terri. I might\u2019ve been a little too shocked to give you the kind of comfort you needed when I first found out, I\u2019m sorry about that. Here\u2019s how I feel\u2014I think it would be a mistake for us to try to make a marriage out of a very nice friendship, but if I\u2019m having a child, I\u2019m committed to the child. For life. I\u2019ll do my part because I want to. You can rest easy about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will your parents feel about that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll feel the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cTerri\u2014I\u2019m thirty-six. I\u2019m past asking my parents for approval. What we\u2019re going to have to do here is find a way to work together.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cWe have to put the needs of the child first.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cGod,\u201d she said, tears sparkling in her eyes. \u201cI never expected you to act like this. I thought you\u2019d take off or deny it. But you\u2019re a good man, Paul. A real good man...\u201d</p><p>If I was worth a damn, you wouldn\u2019t be unmarried and pregnant, he thought. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll fall short a lot, but I\u2019m going to do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have no idea how much that means to me.\u201d</p><p>When their lunch was over, he walked her to her car and she hugged him. \u201cJust having you nearby\u2014that\u2019s very reassuring,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d never hear from you again. Sometimes this feels so lonely.\u201d Then she looked up at him and said, \u201cAlthough I might not have a husband\u2014I feel like I have a partner. Thank you, Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...Yeah. We\u2019ll work together on this, make sure everything is covered...\u201d</p><p>Her arms still around his waist, looking up at him with those large, sad eyes, she said, \u201cMaybe I could make you dinner this weekend...\u201d</p><p>He was shaking his head before she even finished. \u201cWe have to keep this in perspective, Terri. We\u2019re going to be parents together, I guess. But that relationship we had, such as it was? We\u2019re not going to have that relationship anymore. We can\u2019t. It\u2019ll only complicate a situation that\u2019s already complicated.\u201d</p><p>Her face fell. She looked down. \u201cI see,\u201d she said.</p><p>He put a finger under her chin, lifting her face so their eyes met. \u201cWe\u2019re in this together, but we\u2019re not a couple. We never were.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to carry the baby, it would be nice if I also had some affection.\u201d</p><p>He put a small kiss on her brow. \u201cYou have that. As the mother of my child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely sure nothing could grow between us? As we have this baby together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerri, my intention is to be good to you and be a good father. But if there was something more between us, we both would have known before this, before now. I think what we can be is good friends, good parents. Let\u2019s shoot for that, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said with a sad smile. \u201cSure. That\u2019s something, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Terri. That\u2019s all I have. And until that night I called, I think that\u2019s all you had. Think about it\u2014we never even had phone calls. We just weren\u2019t that connected. Let\u2019s move ahead. Let\u2019s see if we can make this work for the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess it\u2019ll have to be enough,\u201d she said, pulling her arms from around him.</p><p>For the first time he thought, what if she takes this child away from me? What if she finds someone else, some guy, willing to be that husband and father? And it puts me in the way? I have to know more about this kind of thing, he thought. I have to know what I can do about this.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I can ask.\u201d He gave her shoulders a brief, friendly squeeze. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa had almost every piece of clothing she owned spread out across the bed. She was trying to pack for a trip to Grants Pass to visit Matt\u2019s parents and she wanted to look her best. She had asked her mother-in-law, Carol, if she would please invite Paul to dinner. She hadn\u2019t seen him since the baby was born and she\u2019d so like to get his attention. But when Vanessa looked in the mirror, she saw a waist that was still too thick, breasts too heavy for her tops and thighs that felt like tree trunks. She couldn\u2019t get into any of her old clothes and she\u2019d be damned if she\u2019d wear maternity clothes. The baby was almost two months old. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vanessa had always been sure of herself. Her mother had called her feisty, her father proclaimed her a handful, her best friends from the airline told her she was a fearless extrovert and counted on her to handle difficult situations with pilots or passengers. Matt had called her his fiery-haired vixen.</p><p>Around Carol, however, she lacked confidence. Carol was chic, perfect, successful and took self-assurance to the next level. Vanessa and Carol seemed to disagree on everything, and Carol managed to get her way at all times by wearing the most engaging smile. Carol Rutledge was possibly the only woman alive Vanessa had trouble standing up to. On top of that, Vanni felt she looked fat.</p><p>Frustrated, she pulled on a pair of jeans with an elastic waistband and her riding boots. She found her father in the great room. \u201cHey, Dad. Matt\u2019s asleep and should be down for another hour or two. Can you listen for him while I take a short ride? I won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d he said, barely looking up from his book.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>At least she was finally cleared to ride again. The exercise and glorious spring weather was good for her spirits. When she got to the stable, she noticed the door to the tack room was ajar. She heard something, hopefully not a mouse. She pushed the door open a bit further and saw her younger brother Tom sitting on the bench, paging through a book. \u201cWhatcha doin?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He jumped in surprise, slammed the book shut and hid it behind his back. His cheeks brightened and he looked like he wanted to die. She walked into the room and reached behind him, grabbing onto the book. She withdrew The Joy Of Sex.</p><p>\u201cIs this mine?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThis is mine!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Vanni. Be a sport, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to clean out the garage for Dad,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut this must have been packed up in my stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not, you know\u2014using this to\u2014You know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, brows drawn together in confusion. Then he caught her meaning; she thought he was using the pictures to beat off. \u201cNo! Jesus, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then what?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI was just a little curious. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She flipped through the pages. It was an old book, but quite graphic. \u201cYou and Brenda aren\u2019t having enough joy?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. Sometimes he hated his sister, and this was one of them. \u201cNo, if you must know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe suggest a little homework?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, we haven\u2019t done it, all right?\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up in surprise. She smiled wryly and lifted a brow. \u201cReally?\u201d she said, grinning.</p> <p>He hated her. \u201cReally,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a virgin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, so help me\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was. He\u2019d made it all the way to eighteen with his virginity intact? Whew, she thought. Either he wasn\u2019t as motivated as most boys his age or he was awfully well mannered. \u201cHmm,\u201d she said. And then it hit her\u2014she and Dad were going to Grants Pass with the baby for the weekend. \u201cOh-oh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d he warned her.</p><p>\u201cYou have a date this weekend, Tommy?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He put his head in his hands. \u201cGod, why couldn\u2019t I have had a big brother...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI presume you\u2019re totally covered?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI swear, if you say anything to anyone, especially\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d she asked a little hotly.</p><p>He looked up at her, almost bored. \u201cAsk yourself\u2014does the general\u2019s boy have the facts about sexual responsibility? Does he have a drawer full of rubbers and all the birth control information available to the entire U.S. Army? Does the kid know anything about STDs? You wanna give me a frickin\u2019 break here? Who is your father, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d she said. Dad probably started talking to him about this stuff when he was three. \u201cI\u2019ll give you that one.\u201d She flipped through the pages. She held the book open, turned it around toward him and gave it back to him. \u201cRead this page. Memorize this page. I\u2019m going for a short ride.\u201d</p><p>She saddled up and took one of the horses out on the trail along the river, thinking about how long it had been since she\u2019d even anticipated making love. Matt left almost a year ago and didn\u2019t come back. She envied Tom, and she was frankly very surprised he was still untouched.</p><p>Well, if they were going to do it, she hoped her little brother would do a decent job of it. Vanessa\u2019s first time had been a waste of time. But hopefully Brenda would fare better\u2014the page she had shown Tom was all about the clitoris.</p><p>Carol and Lance Rutledge had been down to Virgin River twice in the past few months. First, last December to bury their son on the general\u2019s land, an event that was understandably painful. If it wasn\u2019t bad enough that they\u2019d lost their only son, they had nothing to say about where he\u2019d be laid to rest, and Carol had been stiff and angry about the decisions she felt Vanessa had made alone.</p><p>The Rutledges came back right after the baby was born to see their first and what would be their only grandchild. Those visits had been tense until Carol softened toward the baby. Lance, however, was very like his son had been\u2014laid-back, cuddly, humorous. Carol was cool; a well-decked and still sexy grandmother who said, \u201cEw,\u201d when the baby spit up on her blouse.</p><p>Now that the baby was almost two months, Vanni and Walt were going to them for the first time. Vanessa had always hated these visits, even when Matt was alive. Lance Rutledge was so easy to get along with, so unflappable. And, as men will do, Matt and his dad had hung together during visits and either ignored or were oblivious to any discord between the women.</p><p>Vanni wasn\u2019t the only one who had trouble getting along with Carol. She and Matt had laughed about how Carol blamed Paul for talking Matt into quitting college to join the Marine Corps. Paul had gone back to college and received his degree in engineering while Matt stayed with the Corps.</p><p>The Rutledge home was very large for only two people, up on a hill with a long driveway. Lance was an endodontist and Carol had been in real estate for many years and was a real mover and shaker in the business world of Grants Pass. They were certainly successful enough to retire, but they both enjoyed their work, social lives and vacations.</p><p>Carol Rutledge didn\u2019t look her age. She was fit and trim with thick auburn hair that she kept short, manicured nails, a drop-dead wardrobe and, though this was supposed to be a secret, a woman who had benefited from a face-lift that made her look more a youthful fifty than sixty. Before pregnancy and childbirth, Vanni felt equal by comparison, but at the moment, breasts straining at her shirts, hips too wide and waistless, nails trimmed down short, she felt dowdy and insecure.</p><p>When they arrived, Lance grabbed the baby immediately, thrilled to be nuzzling him, while Carol stood beside him, giving the baby a few pats. Vanni wandered into the house, so large and richly decorated. Eventually she moved down the hall to peek into the room Matt had used as a teenager, looking at all the memorabilia. It was everywhere\u2014pictures, letters from high school teams, trophies, posters, airplane models. It hadn\u2019t been preserved, but restored, like a shrine. A small framed picture of the baby now rested on the bureau, as though Matt would be back directly. It almost made Vanni cry.</p><p>That evening, as Lance turned steaks on the grill with Walt and the women keeping him company on the deck, Vanni learned that Carol had at least one surprise in store for her. \u201cI\u2019ve invited another guest to dinner tomorrow night, Vanessa,\u201d Carol told her. \u201cA friend of ours\u2014a young doctor I met through work. His name is Cameron and he\u2019s just darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol, you\u2019re not fixing me up, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! But I didn\u2019t think it was too soon for you to meet someone. If you two get along, maybe sometime in the future...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fixing you up,\u201d Lance said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it sounds like,\u201d Walt agreed.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Vanni said miserably.</p><p>\u201cStop it, all of you. We\u2019ve had Cameron to dinner before, and he\u2019s charming. I happen to like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Carol, Paul will be here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey,\u201d she said brightly. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll hit it off. I know if Matt were with us, he\u2019d like Cameron.\u201d</p><p>How could she do that so well? Make Vanni feel guilty, as though Matt would want her to meet this Cameron? Vanni\u2019s pants immediately began to feel more snug, her belly rounder, her breasts bulkier and nails choppier. Not only would she look plump and awkward to Paul, but to two men. She tried to be ready for anything with Carol, but hadn\u2019t counted on something like this, a new widow with a baby just two months old\u2014and two bachelors at dinner. One of whom she had been missing. Missing so much.</p><p>\u201cWe should talk about what you\u2019re going to do next, Vanessa,\u201d Carol said smoothly. \u201cWith just the smallest interest in real estate, I could take you into our firm. Your hours would be flexible for the baby, the market is good right now and it would set you up for a successful career.\u201d She beamed. \u201cI could work alongside you until you get your sea legs.\u201d</p><p>Vanni wanted to die. She\u2019d rather have an ax firmly planted in her skull than work with Carol every day. \u201cI\u2019m...ah...afraid real estate doesn\u2019t appeal to me much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be thinking of flying again,\u201d Carol said. \u201cReally, I could help. At least give it a fair chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon for me to think about that now. I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d Carol said, patting her knee and smiling.</p><p>Vanni was a long way from having Carol figured out. She seemed to be trying to be helpful, but she plowed through every polite, \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d and did as she pleased. She\u2019d made Vanni\u2019s wedding a nightmare with her interference. Vanni\u2019s mother had been deceased only a short time, and Carol had wanted to step in and help in that role, but she took over. Carol had not liked the colors of the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses; she preferred coral to pale green. She thought that by getting a consensus from the bridesmaids and paying for the ones she liked, the problem was solved, but Vanni had hated them. When she had appealed to Matt, he had said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with orange, or whatever that is? They look nice and the girls like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey clash with my hair!\u201d Vanni had tearfully argued. \u201cThere will be pictures...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d said Matt, the peacekeeper. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a daughter\u2014why not let her have her way about some small things?\u201d So Vanni let it go and Carol changed the flowers from Vanni\u2019s favorites of calla lilies to white roses and baby\u2019s breath. She added a hundred names to her guest list and presided over the parties and wedding reception as though it was her wedding, cracking the whip over caterers and florists like an Egyptian pharaoh. \u201cTry not to worry about little things,\u201d Matt had said. \u201cReally, she\u2019s only trying to help. She just wants everything to be beautiful for us.\u201d It left Vanni in the uncomfortable position of fighting it out with her future husband or future mother-in-law.</p><p>As for Saturday night\u2019s dinner, Cameron arrived a good half hour before Paul for drinks. Vanni suspected Carol had told Cameron six and Paul six-thirty, and because of that, Vanni didn\u2019t give Carol any credit at all for coming up with a perfectly nice man in her attempted setup.</p><p>But the man who stood before Vanessa had absolutely no excuse for being thirty-five and single. He was so good-looking, he could make a woman pee her pants. He was six feet with dark hair, heavy, expressive brows, sexy dimples in his cheeks when he smiled and teeth so white that they almost made you gasp when he grinned. And he grinned hugely when he met Vanessa. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a doctor, I\u2019m told,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.

Gorgeous, hot and loves kids.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, you don\u2019t have children?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t work that in. But now that I can, all the good women seem to be taken. But hey, I still have time to father children. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d Grin.</p><p>Oh, yeah, she thought. He could probably father them like mad.</p><p>Carol directed them to a pair of chairs in the living room\u2014soft comfortable chairs that faced each other at angles, separated by a side table, where they could sit and get to know each other. Walt and Lance resumed their positions on the deck after initial introductions so the couple that was not being fixed up\u2014ha!\u2014could have this intimate little session to themselves. Carol delivered them drinks and then pleaded business in the kitchen, leaving them alone.</p><p>So Vanni had what turned out to be a very pleasant conversation with Cameron Michaels. She would have taken him for a doctor at once\u2014though he was broad shouldered and nicely muscled, he was dressed like an ad for GQ. But a children\u2019s doctor? He should have some spit-up on his shoulder or poop on his shoe to be convincing.</p><p>He worked with a group of pediatricians in town and had just bought his first real house\u2014through Carol of course. It was much too big for just him, but he couldn\u2019t resist it. And he didn\u2019t think it was too late to fill it with family, if the right woman came along. He asked about Virgin River and the baby, and was fascinated by her home birth with a midwife. She relented to herself that there was nothing about him not to like when the doorbell rang and she began to rise.</p> <p>Carol flew out of the kitchen like a rocket, aimed at the door. \u201cStay put\u2014I\u2019ve got it. That will be Paul. Cameron, you\u2019re going to love Paul,\u201d she said on the fly.</p><p>Vanni looked around. This pair of chairs was isolated from the rest of the room; a cozy little corner. There was no place for Paul to sit and join them and again she thought\u2014I always underestimate my mother-in-law. She has everything worked out. She must plan to shuffle Paul out onto the deck with Walt and Lance right after introductions. But that\u2019s not what Vanni had in mind.</p><p>She stood. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said to Cameron. She walked toward the door just as Paul was coming in.</p><p>The minute she saw him, she felt more alive. Paul was not as pretty as Cameron, nor even Matt, for that matter. Paul had rougher good looks. He was probably six-two, his arms so strong thanks to years of physical labor in home construction, thick sandy colored hair still cut short in that military fashion. He was tan, had big, gentle hands, a strong jaw and when he saw her his dark eyes sparkled. She nearly ran to him, hugging him close. He lifted her off the ground.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d He put her on her feet. \u201cLet me look at you. Aw, Vanni\u2014you look fantastic. It\u2019s like you never had a baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a liar,\u201d she laughed.</p> <p>\u201cCan I see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d she said, grabbing his hand and dragging him right down the hall, leaving Carol standing at the door, her greeting ignored. Although little Matt was asleep, she picked him up and presented him to Paul. \u201cHere you go,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t hesitate. He took the baby into his arms, holding him close. \u201cHe\u2019s so big.\u201d Then he met Vanni\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe looks just like him, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve compared their baby pictures and it\u2019s just a little Matt all over again.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s head popped in the room. \u201cCome on, you two,\u201d she said cheerily. \u201cWe have company.\u201d Then she quickly withdrew, clearly expecting them to follow as ordered.</p><p>Paul questioned with his eyes and Vanni sighed. \u201cCarol\u2019s trying to fix me up,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Paul said. \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot thrilled. But it\u2019s not the guy\u2019s fault\u2014and he seems like a perfectly nice guy. Still...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust not ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot for him,\u201d she said, frowning. \u201cCome on, we\u2019d better be social or we\u2019ll be punished. Paul,\u201d she said, touching his arm, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much. Tommy misses you, too. You have to come to Virgin River soon. Will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>She took the baby from him and put him back in the crib. Then, pulling him by the hand, took him to the living room. When they got there, Cameron stood. Carol intercepted Paul, taking his hand out of Vanni\u2019s to pull him forward. \u201cCameron, this is Paul Haggerty\u2014he was my son\u2019s best friend. He and Vanni are like brother and sister.\u201d</p><p>The men shook hands, but there was obvious and instant reticence in the postures of both\u2014Carol wasn\u2019t fooling either one of them. Vanni took it upon herself to drag a chair across the room so that Paul could join them, catching her mother-in-law\u2019s frown out of the corner of her eye. And when they were all called to dinner, Carol seated them according to her plan\u2014she and Lance occupied the heads of the table, Paul sat beside Walt, Vanni beside Cameron. And that\u2019s how they remained.</p><p>Another of Carol\u2019s talents was to grease the conversation and she got people talking quickly so that there was no tension at her table. She might as well have had a notebook beside her with specific questions and topics for each person at her table, so that each one had his turn to talk. She did drop into the conversation several times that Paul was Matt\u2019s best man, Paul and Vanessa had been friends for years, Paul worked construction and oh, yes, Cameron was a doctor.</p><p>One topic Carol couldn\u2019t control was Virgin River, and at her table were three people who loved it there and extolled all its virtues\u2014from redwoods, mountains, valleys and rivers, to the little bar and grill run by Jack and frequented by friends and neighbors, reuniting Marines, playing host to hunters and fishermen.</p><p>After dessert and coffee, Paul was the first to leave, which Vanni thought must thrill Carol. But that was all right, because Vanni walked him outside. They hugged. \u201cI don\u2019t think of you as a brother,\u201d she said.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think of you as a sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish she hadn\u2019t done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol does as she pleases. She always has. We understand that,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to spend more time with you. How are you, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing okay. And you? Really? How are you doing with missing him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always miss him. I miss him as much as you do, Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, hanging his head for a moment. \u201cCan\u2019t really help that, can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t cry about him so much anymore. Matt wouldn\u2019t want that\u2014and he said so\u2014he made me promise. Plus, Mattie takes a lot of energy, and gives me so much joy. I\u2019m riding again\u2014which is a wonderful diversion. Come down, Paul. For a weekend. Soon. Ride with me...play with the baby.\u201d</p><p>Carol stuck her head out the front door. \u201cVanessa? I think I hear the baby.\u201d</p><p>Vanni took a breath. \u201cWell, Carol, you can pick him up if he\u2019s crying. Or you can tell my dad\u2014he knows what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Carol said. \u201cSure. But you\u2019ll be in soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Vanni said, an irritated edge to her voice.</p><p>The door softly closed and Paul chuckled.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Vanni said, rubbing her temples with her fingertips. \u201cThat woman...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Carol. No one takes her seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo their peril,\u201d Vanni said. Then she looked up at Paul. \u201cPlease\u2014come to Virgin River soon. We all miss you. Especially me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I should do that. So\u2014what do you think of that guy? At least she found you a doctor.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cShe should get credit for that, huh?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHe seems pretty nice\u2014and it\u2019s not his fault he got fixed up with someone who isn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be ready one of these days.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m ready now, she wanted to say.</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a call. We\u2019ll set something up\u2014get together soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, very conscious of the fact that she had been the one calling him since the baby\u2019s birth. And then she watched him go. So, I may not think of him as a brother, but he still thinks of me as his best friend\u2019s wife. She feared that might never change.</p><p>Tommy and Brenda had gone to a lot of trouble to arrange a whole night alone at the Booth house while the general and Vanni were both away in Grants Pass, but all that preplanning backfired. Brenda was edgy. Maybe scared. Not ready for it. Tom could tell after fifteen minutes that this wasn\u2019t going the way he thought it would. The way she had said she wanted it to.</p><p>So, he throttled back. \u201cRelax,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just watch a movie. We don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be disappointed,\u201d Brenda said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d he lied. \u201cI told you a hundred times\u2014we\u2019re not going all the way until you\u2019re ready. We\u2019ll just watch a movie and curl up. We\u2019ll sleep in our clothes. I\u2019m not going to push you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what makes me like this. I thought I\u2019d made up my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize, Bren. Not to me. I like that you\u2019re giving it a lot of thought. I want you to be sure, because afterward, you have to be happy about it, not all screwed up and guilty. There\u2019s no other way it can be, not for us. Since we\u2019re in for the night\u2014should we pilfer a couple of the general\u2019s beers and put on a movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou pick the movie, I\u2019ll pick the beer.\u201d</p><p>Of course it had to be a chick flick; a real groaner at that. But what the hell, if it made Brenda happy, it made him happy. Halfway through the movie and the beer, the kissing started and he thought, God bless chick flicks. They might be boring, but they sure did warm up the girls.</p><p>They reclined on the sofa and pressed their bodies tightly against each other, kissing wildly, openmouthed, tongues going nuts. He got hard, of course. By now she was used to that and she liked it, grinding against him very nicely, getting some good feelings of her own. This sort of thing had been happening between them for a while now, and it was extremely satisfying. And while Tom didn\u2019t want her to do anything she\u2019d regret, he definitely wanted to try out what he\u2019d learned on page ninety-seven. Shew\u2014the magic button. He just wanted to touch the magic button one time. Just for a second. Just to see what happened.</p><p>He lifted her shirt, unhooked her bra and felt her soft breasts. She loved it when he did that\u2014it caused her to moan and wiggle. She was getting so hot that he wondered...\u201cBren,\u201d he said breathlessly. He put a hand over her crotch on the outside of her clothes. \u201cCan I just touch you here? Just with my hand? Nothing else\u2014just my hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she said against his lips. \u201cIf you want to.\u201d</p><p>He thought he might die, he was so excited. He opened the snap on her jeans and slipped his hand down and down, slowly and gently, over her flat tummy, over her soft mound, just a little further, into a place that was dark, secret, hot and damp, looking for a spot described on page ninety-seven as the trip-wire for the female orgasm. He felt a small, hard knot and when he made contact she gasped and pushed against his hand. The very second he made contact, it electrified her. \u201cTommy,\u201d she said in a weak whisper.</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cThat feels nice, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOoooh,\u201d she moaned, moving back and forth, up and down. \u201cGod...\u201d</p><p>Go for it, Brenda, he thought. Just go for it. He rubbed a little harder, reached a little further, making contact with her opening with one finger just as his other finger stayed with the magic button. He gave it a great deal of personal attention\u2014teasing her, softly touching, roughly rubbing, all according to the suggestions in the book. The whimpering sounds she made were almost as if she was crying; panting, squirming, writhing. And then, kabam! She froze, her breath caught, and against his hand he felt the most amazing clenching sensation. \u201cOh God,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d she said in a breath. An exhausted, happy breath. She collapsed in his embrace. \u201cHow did you know to do that? That wonderful thing you just did?\u201d</p><p>He was not about to say his sister tipped him off. \u201cEveryone knows,\u201d he lied. He wondered if half the male population was as dismally uninformed as he had been. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, getting off the couch. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get more comfortable and do that some more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can even stand up,\u201d she said, limp and satisfied.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he laughed, pulling her up.</p><p>He took her to his room, the chick flick still playing in the background. They fell onto his bed, kissing. He pulled off his sweater and then hers, holding her close with her breasts against his chest and thought\u2014I have waited forever to feel this. It didn\u2019t take him long to coax her out of her jeans, because she wanted his hand on her again. His pants coming off was another story. When he started to remove them, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know when you\u2019re sure, because I\u2019m pretty much past sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could just put it close. Touch me there a little bit. I mean, don\u2019t put it in yet, but touch it there a little bit, let me get used to the idea...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d he said, but he was positive what she was asking for was beyond the realm of possibility. Whatever, it got him out of his pants, and he was desperate.</p><p>They\u2019d never gotten this far before, but she had always said she wanted the first time to be special and if what she had out on the couch wasn\u2019t special, he just couldn\u2019t imagine how much more special it could get.</p><p>He got a condom out of the drawer and ripped it out of the package. \u201cBrenda, we\u2019re gonna play it real safe, honey. We don\u2019t want to get too close and not be double safe, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, laying back, eyes closed, ready to be pleasured again.</p><p>He laughed in spite of himself. \u201cYou like that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>Sheathed and ready, feeling as if he didn\u2019t unload this gun he\u2019d be walking on three legs for the rest of his life, he lowered himself to touch her in the place where he might enter her if he ever got permission, and then he put his fingers on the magic button and went to work. This thing was like a miracle, he thought. Response was instant. Faster than instant. She was moaning, writhing, panting. And he was dying, barely touching her, holding out, holding back. The strain was starting to make his head pound. He was in complete misery while she clearly neared ecstasy once again. Finally he just lost his mind. \u201cLet me,\u201d he begged. \u201cGod, Brenda. Let me in.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her pelvis up a little and he slid forward. He put a hand under her bum while he massaged with his fingers. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d she said.</p><p>He slid into her slowly and discovered it was everything he dreamed it would be. He was surrounded by this tight, hot, wonderful body, cinching down on him. But he wasn\u2019t crazy, he wasn\u2019t letting go of that miracle button. He worked it, and beneath him she went crazy. It didn\u2019t take long before she rose against him, froze, gasped and the spasms he had felt against his hand before were nothing compared to what he felt when she tightened around him while he was right there, inside. She went off like a missile and, although she might have been totally unaware, so did he. It was the most amazing experience of his young male life. It shook him up so bad his whole body trembled. He pulsed until his brain was emptied.</p><p>\u201cOoooh,\u201d she said.</p><p>That was how much more special, he thought. And he croaked, \u201cGood God.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Tom,\u201d she said, not unhappily. \u201cWe did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d he said, breathless.</p><p>\u201cThat was...Holy cow, Tommy. That was awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d he agreed, almost faint.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it again,\u201d she said.</p><p>And that\u2019s when he learned that for women, all things are possible, and for men, time is required. There was recovery involved. Women, apparently, could just hop back on that bus, while the men were left to deal with a flat tire. He committed that to memory\u2014these gorgeous creatures needed no time to get ready again. \u201cYou might have to give me a couple of minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d she asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cWell, Brenda, we could always time it...\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cDid you know it was going to be that wonderful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had known, I don\u2019t think I could have waited as long as I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he said, kissing her softly. And what he thought was, who knew? This girl who had been saving it, waiting for that special moment, so nervous about the whole thing\u2014well, once she was a little stimulated, she was hot as a pistol. On fire. Completely and totally into it, giving and giving, trusting, wild and wonderful. And people said the first time wasn\u2019t that great for a girl. Hah.</p><p>She snuggled closer to him and giggled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the end, you begged.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI did. I begged. I\u2019m sorry\u2014I swore to you I\u2019d never beg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with it now,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have to beg again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cI want to tell you something.\u201d He brushed her hair back from her face. \u201cWhen I go into the Army, I\u2019m planning to be faithful to you while I\u2019m away. Until you tell me you want to be free of commitment or have somebody else or something, I\u2019m going to be thinking that you\u2019re my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Tom. Are you sure you want to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m totally sure. I was sure a long time ago. I didn\u2019t just say that to get into you, Brenda. I think you know I\u2019m not the kind of guy who wants to screw around. This means something to me. I love you a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be your girl,\u201d she said. \u201cI love being your girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe someday, when we\u2019re older, when we\u2019ve finished school, maybe it\u2019ll be more than that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019d like that.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI was going to save this for a surprise\u2014but what the heck. I\u2019ve been applying for scholarships and university admissions. I\u2019m applying mostly in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear the Academy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I don\u2019t want to be away from you, Tom. Not any more than I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenda,\u201d he said, pulling her close. \u201cThat\u2019s such good news.\u201d He slipped his hand down and put his fingers on her. \u201cWere you timing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think enough time has passed...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Ooh, that\u2019s very, very good.\u201d</p><p>The general, Vanni and the baby returned home on Sunday night. Tom had washed all his linens, cleaned the house, taken care of the horses and was doing homework when they arrived. Vanni appeared to be extremely tired and irritated, so he went straight to her and took Mattie out of her arms. \u201cWas it fun?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDepends on your definition of fun,\u201d she said, walking down the hall to her bedroom.</p><p>Tom followed her. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Carol if she\u2019d invite Paul\u2014I haven\u2019t seen him since the baby was born. And she said sure, but she also invited another guy. She was fixing me up. It was very uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t really get a chance to talk to Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of guy?\u201d he asked, holding the baby against him.</p><p>\u201cA nice guy. Under any other circumstances, I would\u2019ve enjoyed meeting him. A doctor. A pediatrician from Grants Pass.\u201d</p><p>Tom laughed. \u201cWell, I guess if you\u2019d just fall for him, you could marry a guy who\u2019s really somebody, move to Grants Pass, be close to Granny and make her look good.\u201d</p><p>A stricken look came over Vanni\u2019s face. \u201cGod, that\u2019s it! She\u2019s trying to hook me up with a local guy\u2014to get us under her thumb again! But then\u2014\u201d She stopped for a minute, thinking. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she try to hook me up with Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul is a construction worker. He was an enlisted Marine. Vanni\u2014this new guy is a doctor! Besides.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cPaul wouldn\u2019t put up with Carol\u2019s shit. I know him. He wouldn\u2019t. Not for long, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Carol had never approved of the fact that her son hadn\u2019t finished his degree and spent his career in the fighting Marines; she was pretty snobby about things like money, credentials, prestige. She had always intimated that Vanni\u2019s decision to be a flight attendant, even though she had a degree, was copping out. She had always asked Vanni what she planned to do next.</p><p>\u201cYou know Carol,\u201d Tom laughed. \u201cThe sooner she can get you fixed up to her satisfaction, the less she has to worry you\u2019ll fall for someone who makes his home in Florida. She always covers her bases. She\u2019s on top of everything.\u201d He put the baby in the crib. \u201cHow\u2019d he do on the trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. He\u2019s a good little traveler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my man Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I keep begging him to come back here, but he won\u2019t commit. Hey, how was your weekend?\u201d</p><p>He ducked his head. \u201cNice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe watched a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem pretty relaxed,\u201d she said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you anything,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, buddy. But everything around here was all right while we were gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He left her bedroom. Then he stuck his head back into the doorway and said, \u201cKnow what I said about wishing I\u2019d had a big brother? I take it back.\u201d Then he disappeared.</p><p>Three</p><p>L ess than a week after visiting Grants Pass, Vanessa opened the front door of her father\u2019s house to find Cameron Michaels standing on the stoop. \u201cWell, hey,\u201d she said, surprised.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, showing her that sexy, dimpled grin. \u201cI decided to have a look at this little town, see what all the fuss is about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding? You should\u2019ve called. We could have made some plans together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it too late for that? Because all I was going to do is drive around the area. Maybe drop into that bar you and Paul were raving about. If you\u2019re not too busy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of far to come for just a look around...\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI have a couple of days off in a row, which I pay for by being on call all weekend, and I thought, what the heck? It\u2019s worth a shot. It was a very last minute idea.\u201d</p><p>She lifted one brow and folded her arms over her chest. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have any trouble finding the house.\u201d</p><p>He had the grace to laugh a little and avert his eyes, caught. \u201cCarol,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLook, you should understand something. I respect my mother-in-law, but she can be a little pushy and\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He put a hand on her arm to stop her. \u201cHey, Vanni\u2014I asked her. And I didn\u2019t call on purpose. I didn\u2019t want to give you time to think of an excuse. I thought if I popped in unannounced, you might just cave in. Spend a couple of hours with me. You can punish me for bad manners later.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you have a little time?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as though I\u2019m busy, but I have a baby who still nurses a lot.\u201d</p> <p>He tilted his head and grinned. \u201cI\u2019m pretty comfortable around babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You would be, huh. Well, come on in.\u201d</p><p>He stepped inside and looked around. \u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a great place. From the outside it looks like just an ordinary house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad had the inside completely gutted and remodeled while he was serving his last tour in the Army. Last summer he and my brother Tommy came out and I joined them in the fall.\u201d She walked into the great room and found her boots sitting by the chair. She sat down to pull them on while Cameron went to the window and looked out at the stable, corral and pasture. \u201cDo you ride?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI did years ago. I haven\u2019t been on a horse since I was a teenager.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you like horses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have great respect for horses. The last time I was near one, he stepped on my foot. Broke it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they should beep when they back up. You have to be alert.\u201d She stood and smoothed her jeans. \u201cMattie is due to wake up any second. I can feed him, change him, beg him to behave and we could take a little run around Virgin River. How\u2019s that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike just what I was hoping for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very presumptuous, you know,\u201d she said, but she smiled.</p><p>He smiled right back. Confident. \u201cYou\u2019re very beautiful, you know.\u201d</p> <p>She felt her cheeks grow instantly warm. \u201cHelp yourself to something to drink from the kitchen. I\u2019ll see about the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time. Put him in a good mood.\u201d</p><p>Forty-five minutes later they were underway in Walt\u2019s big Tahoe. Cameron had come to Virgin River in a Porsche and there was no room in it for a car seat. She drove him out Highway 299, through the redwoods, then out to sit at the Virgin River where there were only a couple of anglers, it not being the best time of year for fishing. She explained the seasonal sports\u2014fly-fishing in the summer, salmon in fall and winter was best, bear and deer hunting season from September through October, waterfowl hunting season October to January. Forest fire season from June through October. In summer the hikers and campers were all over the place.</p><p>While they were looking at the sights she learned that Cameron hailed from Portland, went to undergrad and medical school at Stanford and had parents, one brother and one sister in Portland, both married with kids. He did his residency in family medicine, then decided pediatrics was his first love. \u201cI\u2019ve disappointed my parents in the area of grandchildren, but I don\u2019t think they should be so quick to write me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d she said. \u201cMel, my midwife, and her husband, Jack, didn\u2019t marry until he was forty\u2014and they\u2019re expecting their second now. Jack says each one makes him feel younger. Mel frowns at him when he says that. I think the babies are a little closer together than she likes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedical school and residency is consuming. I was thirty by the time I was ready to go into practice, and that wasn\u2019t simple. I had big time bills to pay off and it wasn\u2019t easy to find an existing pediatric practice in Oregon that needed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it had to be Oregon, huh?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAt the time, I thought it had to be. I\u2019ve become a lot more flexible since then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you like your practice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good docs. One woman and two men\u2014outstanding physicians.\u201d</p><p>Vanni continued the tour by driving him up into the foothills where sheep and cattle grazed, down through the valley where vineyards were just beginning to come to life and finally, as the afternoon had aged, they ended up at Jack\u2019s. By the time they got there, Matt was fussing and demanding dinner. Before she could get to him, Cam had him out of the car seat and was jiggling him against his chest. Cameron had the diaper bag slung over his shoulder as well, taking charge. It was nice, having a man do that. Not just any man could\u2014it would take someone special to be so confident with a baby. At that moment Vanni realized she\u2019d been feeling so alone, even with her dad\u2019s continual support. She missed her man. She would like to have a partner. She would like Mattie to have a dad.</p><p>When they walked into Jack\u2019s, she was pleased to see the dinner crowd included her people, her friends. The first order of business was to introduce Cam to Jack. \u201cThis is Cameron Michaels, Dr. Michaels, a friend of Matt\u2019s parents. And Cameron, this is Jack.\u201d</p><p>Cameron deftly held the baby against his chest while he shook hands. \u201cPleasure,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about this place. I thought I\u2019d drive down and look it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it. Cameron, meet Paige,\u201d he said just as Paige came from the back. \u201cShe\u2019s married to the guy who really runs this place\u2014our cook, Preacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d he said. \u201cLooks like the stork is on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty soon now\u2014this summer,\u201d she said, smiling sweetly.</p><p>Jack put a beer on the bar and Vanni said, \u201cPaige, can I impose on your hospitality for a few minutes? I should nurse Mattie\u2014we\u2019ve been out driving around all afternoon and he\u2019s hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You know the way.\u201d</p><p>Vanni reached for Mattie and said, \u201cJack, can you introduce Cameron to the crowd? I\u2019ll be back in a little while.\u201d</p><p>She went into Preacher and Paige\u2019s apartment behind the bar, settled herself into the soft leather chair and nursed her baby. In spite of her determination to be strong about the events that shaped her days, she felt the sting of tears. This guy had driven all the way from Grants Pass on the chance he might see her. She\u2019d had a lovely time with him. But where was Paul? She\u2019d give anything to see him, but he didn\u2019t even call. Because, she reminded herself, I\u2019m not a woman to him. I\u2019m his best friend\u2019s wife; he loves me like a sister, whether he\u2019ll admit it or not. Hadn\u2019t it always been like that?</p><p>Cameron was introduced to Preacher, who was very welcoming, if a little distracted by the dinner he was working on. With him in the kitchen was Christopher, who he introduced as his son except the boy called him John. Then there was Mike Valenzuela and Jack\u2019s sister, Brie. Cameron sat down with them for a little while and learned that Mike was a former police detective and sergeant and Brie a former prosecutor. He hadn\u2019t imagined he\u2019d be meeting professionals with such sophisticated educations and experience in a little place like this.</p><p>He was offered dinner of pork loin, garlic mashed potatoes and green beans, but he chose to wait for Vanessa to finish with the baby. And while he waited a beautiful young pregnant woman came in, followed by an old man carrying a young child. The woman leaned across the bar to kiss Jack and then Jack took immediate charge of the child. Cameron was soon introduced to Doc Mullins and Mel Sheridan. A couple more tables were pushed together and they joined the group while Jack, with his son on his hip, fetched the high chair from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMel, I\u2019m fascinated by your work. You deliver most of the town, I\u2019m told,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. I do for the women who don\u2019t have a lot of insurance. Or for special cases like Vanni. She doesn\u2019t look it, but she\u2019s kind of granola natural\u2014she wanted to give birth at her father\u2019s house, and she did a fantastic job. Textbook. In fact, we had a wonderful birthing party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA birthing party?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cIt kind of fell into place. When I was called out, Jack let it slip that she was in labor, so Preacher and Paige packed up dinner from the kitchen and closed the bar. Mike and Brie came out in case any of the children needed tending. With the general and Tommy, Jack and Davie, and of course Paul helping with the delivery, we were a full and happy house. It was great fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it a little melancholy? It being Vanni\u2019s late husband\u2019s child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing about babies, Cameron. They give you such hope. Such joy. That\u2019s why I love this business.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and said, \u201cYou obviously take it personally.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her swollen middle. \u201cNot much longer. Jack promises we\u2019re going to take a break after this one. And I\u2019ve promised that if he doesn\u2019t keep his word, I\u2019m going to shoot him in his sleep.\u201d</p><p>While Doc had his whiskey, Cameron grilled him with questions about small town doctoring, asked Mel about some of her other cases and quizzed Mike about local policing. He asked Brie what kind of law she was practicing and learned that while she\u2019d been a prosecutor in Sacramento, she was now occupied with small cases that included divorces, property closures, water rights disputes and such. The county D.A. used her as a consultant on some cases, as well. He was completely fascinated, completely enchanted. Before long Vanni joined them, Mattie full and content against her shoulder. Cameron reached for the baby across the table and said, \u201cGet yourself a beer. Lucky for you, it\u2019s good for nursing mothers.\u201d When Jack joined them, they were ready for dinner together.</p><p>Cameron enjoyed this excursion far more than he expected to. He had hoped for an opportunity to be with Vanni on the excuse of checking out Virgin River, but it had happened that he was delighted by the town, the people and the families that gathered at Jack\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAre you staying at the general\u2019s?\u201d Jack asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s a motel in Fortuna that has plenty of room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to stay with us,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cOr, I can give you another option,\u201d Jack offered. \u201cThe cabin Mel and I just moved out of is empty and furnished, and right here in Virgin River. Clean sheets on the bed, towels in the bathroom, but no food in the fridge. If you want it, it\u2019s yours. I can even fix you up with food and drink to take with you\u2014I\u2019m tight with the cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Let me draw you a map\u2014the door is never locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s fantastic of you. Since it\u2019s already kind of late, I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write my number at home and at the bar on this map,\u201d he said, drawing on the back of a napkin. \u201cGive me a call anytime. If my family isn\u2019t visiting and using the cabin, you\u2019re welcome to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I pay you for it?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. It\u2019s there for friends and family.\u201d He finished with the map and turned it around to Cameron. \u201cAny friend of Vanni\u2019s is a friend of ours.\u201d</p><p>The night was still young when Mike and Brie said good night. Not long after Jack fetched his son out of the high chair and swept his family away. Doc Mullins said goodbye.</p><p>Cameron had enjoyed his dinner while holding Mattie against his chest; he had loved looking across the table at the beautiful and sexy Vanessa. Julia Roberts, that was what she was. Leggy, full-breasted, her hair a reddish hue shot through with blond, her smile wild and spontaneous, her laugh loud and free. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever run into a woman like this in his life.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Time for you and the baby to go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, and she smiled as though she\u2019d had a good time.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get going. If you\u2019re not too busy tomorrow, maybe you could introduce me to the horses before I head back to Grants Pass.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should go for a ride. The bear are just coming out of hibernation with their cubs, and the deer have fawns now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love that. But is it dangerous? Any worry about the bear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for you,\u201d she said with a big laugh. \u201cI carry a rifle. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d Then she laughed some more.</p> <p>As they stepped out onto the porch of the bar, Cameron stopped and listened. He looked up at the sky\u2014the magnificent clear, black sky studded with a billion stars\u2014and heard in the background the gentle strumming and picking of a Spanish guitar. He held the baby against him with one arm, put the other around Vanessa. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. That\u2019s Mike. Miguel, actually. Isn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer to her. \u201cI love this place.\u201d</p><p>When Jack had settled Mel and Davie into bed, he crept into the kitchen and placed a long-distance call. Paul Haggerty answered and Jack said, \u201cHey, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up is that doctor. Cameron what\u2019s his name. Down here putting the moves on Vanessa. Paul, I\u2019m not going to tell you twice. You better not let this happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, listen. She\u2019s not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure it\u2019s not you who\u2019s not ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there when she met him\u2014at Matt\u2019s parents\u2019 house. She told me\u2014she\u2019s not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the problem is, he\u2019s ready. Buddy, don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Paul said. \u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>When they hung up and Jack went back to Mel, crawling into bed and slipping his hands under the T-shirt to feel her belly, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing it again, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI thought you were asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting in the middle of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel, I wasn\u2019t going to tell you anything. But I\u2019ll tell you, because you\u2019re so goddamn nosy. Paul loves her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then why are you all over me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause this is for them to work out. Not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Paul loves her. And this Cameron\u2014he\u2019s nice, he\u2019s a good guy, he\u2019s slick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for them to work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what the hell do you expect me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of it. You are such a mother hen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe owe Paul...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, if Paul isn\u2019t smart enough or aggressive enough or in love enough to handle this, maybe Vanni is better off with the pediatrician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the wise one in this marriage,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re too emotional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you give Cameron the cabin if you don\u2019t like seeing him with Vanni?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause. He wouldn\u2019t be under the general\u2019s roof tonight.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cJack Sheridan, you are such a sneak. I never give you enough credit.\u201d</p><p>The next morning Cameron was invited to breakfast with Vanni and the general, then out for a ride. It was a weekday and Tommy had school so the general was needed to baby-sit. Vanni took him out alone, just the two of them. Vanni rode Tommy\u2019s horse, a gelding named Chico who was pretty frisky, while she put Cameron on their gentlest mare, Plenty, short for Plenty of Trouble. There were four horses in the stable, all of them good riding mounts with the general\u2019s stallion, Liberty, being the most difficult to manage. As promised, she had a rifle strapped to her saddle.</p><p>\u201cYou ride, shoot, have babies at home\u2014I thought you grew up in the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you grow up with the general, you learn lots of interesting things. And my mom was a farm girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you lose your mom?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA few years ago. She was a real amazing, strong, beautiful woman. She did so many things\u2014besides riding and hunting with my dad, she was also a licensed pilot and followed Dad all over the world. When both my brother and I were born, Dad was off in one conflict or another. For some of the most important times in our family, he was missing\u2014and she never once complained or ragged on him. She admired him, respected the work he did\u2014they were true partners. She was the strongest woman I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cShe was killed in a traffic accident in D.C. Such a waste, such a loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cYou take after her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I do. That would be the highest compliment you could give me.\u201d</p><p>They rode along the river for a while, enjoying the crisp air, the spring foliage. Ponderosa, fir and pine spattered with sequoia rose high above them, covering the foothills. \u201cYou\u2019re doing pretty well,\u201d she observed.</p><p>\u201cIf this old girl doesn\u2019t make any fast moves, I can hang in there.\u201d</p><p>The river trail opened up into a field and Vanni stopped. \u201cLook,\u201d she whispered. On the other side of the field was a small herd of deer, two bucks, several doe and their babies. \u201cIt\u2019s not even the best time of day to see them.\u201d A gentle breeze caressed her; she removed her hat and lifted her hair off her neck to take advantage of the cooling. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to love about this place, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic,\u201d he agreed. \u201cCan we take a break? Get off and walk around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, dismounting. She led Chico toward the river edge and he lowered his head to drink. Cameron did the same with Plenty.</p><p>Vanni gazed off at the deer. She could feel Cameron move up behind her; the warmth of his body was right there, though he didn\u2019t touch her. Then one hand caressed her upper arm while the other pulled her hair away from her ear.</p><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever driven two hundred miles to see a woman I\u2019ve barely met, Vanessa,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Vanni bit on her lower lip. She\u2019d been sleepless last night, thinking. She knew Cameron was interested in her, but that wasn\u2019t enough. Her mind was on Paul.</p><p>She turned around. \u201cI\u2019m very vulnerable, Cameron,\u201d she said by way of warning.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll treat you carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to treat me patiently,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to be any more than friends right now.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d sure like to see where this could go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d she said. \u201cOr nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head and smiled. \u201cDo friends kiss? Just to see if there\u2019s...chemistry?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThey do not. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet is a much more encouraging response than nothing at all. I guess friends kiss when they\u2019ve gotten to know each other and there\u2019s trust. Do I have that right?\u201d</p><p>She sighed deeply. If not for Paul, she might be attracted to Cameron. He was handsome, sexy, sweet. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon. My mother-in-law jumped the gun, introducing us and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s not Carol\u2019s fault. I\u2019m jumping the gun because...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBecause you\u2019re beautiful and fun. So shoot me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think your life is in danger for calling me beautiful and fun. That\u2019s very nice. But I\u2019m not getting involved with you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said we\u2019d be friends,\u201d he argued. And he reached out to stroke her hair.</p><p>\u201cBehave like a friend, Cameron. Like a Boy Scout.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cYou\u2019re asking way too much. I\u2019ll behave, but let\u2019s keep this in perspective. I\u2019m a man. You\u2019re a damn sexy woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to worry you won\u2019t mind your manners?\u201d she asked, lifting a brow.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he promised. \u201cYou\u2019re in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen no touching until...No touching.\u201d</p><p>He put his hands in his pockets. \u201cWhatever you want, Vanessa. I\u2019m just going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>At that very moment, Plenty whinnied, backed away from the stream and bolted.</p><p>\u201cShoot!\u201d Vanni said. \u201cThat little troublemaker.\u201d She pushed Cameron away, grabbed the reins of the gelding, leaped into the saddle and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d She directed her horse after Plenty. \u201cDon\u2019t go away,\u201d she yelled, laughing, as if he could go anywhere, stranded as he was. She whipped at Chico\u2019s rear flank with the end of the rein.</p><p>Vanni took off at a gallop and burst into a dead run, leaning low in the saddle and urging the horse with her heels, going after the mare. The deer lifted their heads and headed for the trees while Plenty ran across the meadow, clearly enjoying her freedom. But Plenty was no match for Chico, who was the second fastest horse in their stable. On the other side of the meadow, Vanni caught up with her, leaned out of her saddle to grab a trailing rein, pulled back on the runaway and slowed her down.</p><p>She trotted back toward Cameron, delivering his horse, laughing in spite of herself. \u201cI forgot to mention, she\u2019s a runner. She sneaks off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was no sneak. That was bold-faced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she laughed. \u201cYou gotta love a woman with nerve.\u201d</p><p>Vanni had known for a long time that her best friend Nikki was in a troubled relationship and that it wasn\u2019t going to last. Cameron had barely departed, headed back for Grants Pass, when the phone rang and Nikki said. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey,\u201d Vanni commiserated. \u201cSomething major must have happened. Big fight?\u201d</p><p>Through her tears, Nikki said, \u201cIt started out as the usual fight\u2014me saying I needed a relationship with a future and him saying he wasn\u2019t ready because of his short, terrible marriage years before we met. Then he dropped the big bomb. A couple of years ago, without telling me, without talking to me about it, he had a vasectomy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Vanni asked. \u201cBut how could he do that without you knowing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was gone on a couple of trips for a little over a week. He only needed a few days to recover completely. I never suspected.\u201d She sniffed into the phone. \u201cCraig was afraid I\u2019d stop taking my birth control pills and try to sneak a baby out of him. He said he was sorry, but he didn\u2019t want a family and was tired of fighting about it.\u201d</p><p>Vanni sank into the chair by the phone. \u201cThis is just...unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that if what we have isn\u2019t good enough\u2014just like it is\u2014then it would probably be better for both of us if I just made good on my threat. Vanni,\u201d she said with a whimper. \u201cWhen did he become that kind of man?\u201d</p><p>Vanni grimaced. It was tempting to say he\u2019d always been like that\u2014selfish, insensitive, an egotistical bore who took a lot more than he gave. But Nikki\u2019s heart was breaking so all she said was, \u201cOh, honey. I\u2019m so sorry. The creep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad helped me move out\u2014all my things are in my parents\u2019 garage. I\u2019m staying with them while I look for something to rent. I\u2019m calling from the car. I don\u2019t have to work for a few days. Can I come up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Vanni said. Nikki and Vanni had been best friends since they both started at the airline. They\u2019d gotten each other through a dozen rotten boyfriends, but nothing like this. Nikki had been with Craig for five years.</p><p>Nikki had been Vanni\u2019s maid of honor when she married Matt. Vanni would have been lost without Nikki to talk to, to lean on when Matt was deployed to Iraq. When he was killed, she spent hours on the phone with her best friend. Of course she would try to comfort Nikki now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI feel so stupid,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cWhy\u2019d I let myself fall in love with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we really help who we love?\u201d Vanni asked with a sigh. \u201cJust get up here. We\u2019ll eat fattening food, play with the baby, tease Tom, ride the horses and stick pins in a Craig doll. Nikki, you know it\u2019s time to move on\u2014he wasn\u2019t good enough for you. And what he did\u2014that was so deceptive, you could never count on him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, what\u2019s wrong with us?\u201d Nikki asked. \u201cWhy are we stuck loving men who don\u2019t love us?\u201d</p><p>With a shock of clarity, Vanni gulped. Why indeed, she asked herself. And then we feel so stupid, like such failures. It was wrong, all wrong. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work on that, my friend. Both of us.\u201d</p> <p>Joe Benson got a call from his old friend, Preacher, explaining that he and Paige had done a lot of talking about their growing family. Right now they were housed in Jack\u2019s old apartment behind the bar\u2014a small L-shaped bedroom/living room built for a single man\u2014while Paige\u2019s son, four-year-old Chris, was sleeping in the bedroom above the kitchen that had once been Preacher\u2019s. With a baby coming and maybe more in their future, they had to do something. They thought about buying a larger house, but in point of fact, Paige and Preacher loved living right where they worked. As far as either of them could foresee, Preacher would always be the cook and manager at Jack\u2019s bar with Paige as his right hand.</p><p>Preacher had talked to Jack about allowing him to enlarge their quarters. Jack thought it was a fine idea; it would at least double the value of the property. He made Preacher a deal\u2014if Preacher would build on, Jack would get together a contract to make him a full partner and half-owner. If the bar and grill and attached home was ever sold, the proceeds would be split.</p><p>Before any further discussion could occur, an architect would have to be consulted to see if building on was feasible. There was room; the property on which the bar sat was comfortably large. Preacher wanted to find a plan that would give them plenty of space and wouldn\u2019t disrupt business too much during renovation.</p><p>That\u2019s where Joe came in. If Joe thought it was a good idea and could draw up some plans, Preacher could begin to look for a builder.</p><p>Joe loved an excuse to spend a day or two with Jack and Preacher. And it made him feel good when his buddies asked him for help; he always gave them a deal on the designs. So Joe said, \u201cI\u2019ll have to see the space and the structure, do some measuring. It\u2019s not raw land, Preach. An add-on is a little complicated\u2014the basic structure has to support additional square footage. Tell you what. I\u2019ll drive down tomorrow, stay overnight...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTomorrow?! Oh, man, that\u2019s great of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you and Paige, Preach? It\u2019s an honor.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s what he had done. When you\u2019re an architect with your own small firm, you make your own hours, design at three in the morning sometimes, if that\u2019s when the inspiration hits. So he made it to the bar before noon on Thursday, had a nice long lunch with Mel and Jack, Preacher and Paige and they talked about the expansion. To Joe\u2019s surprise, Preacher was the one with the most elaborate ideas\u2014he wanted a large great room and dining room, a play area for the kids, a small office for himself, plus a total of four bedrooms. And, he wanted the family connected, not separated the way it was\u2014right now they had to go through the kitchen and up the back stairs to get to Christopher\u2019s room. Preacher wanted it to become a house like any other house\u2014with a clear path to all the rooms. And maybe a fireplace. The only thing he didn\u2019t need was a kitchen.</p><p>Joe got busy right after lunch, sketching, measuring, tromping through their quarters and around the yard behind the house. There were some beautiful big trees back there he\u2019d rather not disturb and a huge brick barbecue he\u2019d prefer not to move. He could see the potential for a nice, spacious house connected to the bar by one door through the kitchen, and with two separate entrances independent of the bar. The downstairs could be enlarged enough to hold a great room, master bedroom and bath, dining room and serving station with storage for their personal dishes and dining accessories, with a breakfast bar separating the serving station from the dining room. He could install a food-warming tray, dishwasher, trash compactor and sink in their serving station for convenience. He left the laundry room right where it was, just inside the door to the bar. The addition of a small office would square out the first floor and support additional bedrooms and a loft on the second floor. They could entertain friends and have family meals there. The stairs to the second floor could be removed to enlarge their ground space and they could put an open staircase to the second floor in the great room.</p><p>There was room upstairs for two additional bedrooms and an open loft. The bedrooms would be large enough for more than one child, with walk-in closets. Their total living space now was twelve hundred square feet and he could turn it into three thousand without even breathing hard.</p><p>The only inconvenience would be that Preacher and his family would have to move out for most of the construction. Joe knew they had some options\u2014one of which was Jack and Mel\u2019s cabin. Small, but serviceable for four to six months.</p> <p>It was almost five by the time Joe was ready to discuss these possibilities with Preacher, Jack and Paige. Since Jack was busy serving, and Preacher and Paige were busy cooking and clearing, he would enjoy a beer while waiting out the dinner crowd. He had a large sketch pad and notebook full of measurements that he flipped closed for the time being.</p><p>That\u2019s when he saw her, the profile of a small brunette with long, silky dark hair that went halfway down her back. Right beside her, leaning toward her and talking in her ear, was Vanni. For a moment Joe was struck dumb. Then, gathering his wits, he said, \u201cVanni?\u201d</p><p>Vanni looked up, past the back of her friend\u2019s head and said, \u201cJoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>She immediately left her beer and her friend and came over to him. Of course they\u2019d met more than once, the last time being at her husband\u2019s funeral. Joe knew Matt; he\u2019d met him in Grants Pass when he\u2019d been home on leave. They\u2019d been introduced by Paul.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked, embracing him.</p><p>\u201cA little design work for Preacher and Paige,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to enlarge their home. You know\u2014to accommodate the baby and then some.\u201d The thought that immediately came to mind was the conversation he and Paul had had a couple of weeks ago. Paul was in love with this woman and had messed it up so bad, he probably didn\u2019t stand a chance. Joe peered around Vanni at the woman with her, but he saw only her profile. She was exquisite. Beautiful beyond words.</p><p>\u201cNikki,\u201d Vanni called. \u201cCome here.\u201d When Nikki approached, her smile very small and maybe shy, Vanni made introductions. \u201cMeet Joe, a friend of Matt\u2019s and Paul\u2019s. Joe, meet my best friend, Nikki.\u201d</p> <p>He put out a hand and she laid hers in his. \u201cNice to meet you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cA pleasure,\u201d she said, but then she glanced down.</p><p>\u201cGee, this is terrible,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cIf I\u2019d known you were coming, I\u2019d have made plans to do something special for you. I would have cooked dinner or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be glad to buy you a little of Preacher\u2019s dinner if you\u2019ll stay,\u201d he offered. \u201cI\u2019d really enjoy that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, that\u2019s sweet. But I\u2019ve left my dad baby-sitting for a while and I had Preacher pack us up something to go. I\u2019m still nursing\u2014my escapes are very brief. I could get Preacher to add to it if you\u2019ll come out to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could, but I have to discuss building plans with these folks tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoggone it, Joe. Next time, please let me know you\u2019re coming. I\u2019d like to spend some time with you, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a promise,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be back. Guaranteed.\u201d But will she be back? Joe wondered. Nikki. He wouldn\u2019t forget that name.</p><p>Right at that moment, Paige came out with a big sack holding their dinner. Vanni fished for her wallet and Joe said, \u201cOn me, sweetheart. Amends for not calling you ahead. A mistake I\u2019ll never make again.\u201d He pulled a couple of twenties out of his pocket, peeled them off, laid them on the bar and reached for the take-out sack to pass to her. \u201cEnjoy the best food you\u2019ll ever eat,\u201d he said to Nikki.</p><p>Nikki gave her head a small nod while Vanni said, \u201cGee, thanks! I sure didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d Then she leaned toward Joe and gave him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s very sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy,\u201d he said. \u201cNice meeting you, Nikki,\u201d he said, wishing that he\u2019d had a little cheek press from her. But what he got instead was another small nod.</p><p>They left and he went back to his beer. It was quite a while before Jack was freed up enough to walk down to his end of the bar, wiping his hands on a dish towel. \u201cHow\u2019d you do there?\u201d he asked, glancing at the sketch pad.</p><p>\u201cI think I have some good ideas here,\u201d Joe said. \u201cWith the right builder, this could work out nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe right builder is the problem. When I was finishing my house, I couldn\u2019t find squat around here. That\u2019s why I called Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I know some people,\u201d Joe said. \u201cI might be able to help you with that. First, we have to see if you three like my ideas. And, by the way, who was that woman with Vanni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend from the flight attendant days. I gather they\u2019re best friends who flew together for years and she\u2019s up here to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Joe said. \u201cShe\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBased in San Francisco,\u201d Jack said with a smile. \u201cShe\u2019s going home tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so am I.\u201d He lifted his beer. \u201cHere\u2019s to another close call.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed.</p><p>Joe took a long drink, Jack wandered away and Joe thought, I\u2019ve been to San Francisco five times in the past year and I never saw anyone like that. Why not? This is a town of six hundred. I shouldn\u2019t see anyone that amazing here\u2014I should see ten or twenty so gorgeous in the city.</p><p>Jack came back with his coffee cup. Joe merely looked up at him and said, \u201cThis place. It\u2019s kind of scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Jack said, taking a sip of his coffee. \u201cI found Mel here. That stuff isn\u2019t supposed to happen.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>P aul knew that Jack was right\u2014he\u2019d have to make his presence felt in Virgin River soon. He couldn\u2019t let the doctor be the only one there when Vanni came out of mourning and was ready to get on with her life. So he called the general and asked if it would be all right to come down for a weekend visit, to see the family and the baby.</p><p>He got up early on Saturday morning and made the drive in record time. He pulled up in front of the house and what he saw from the driveway gave him pause. Vanni was dressed in well-worn jeans, chambray shirt with the sleeves rolled up, boots and a Stetson, standing out in front of Matt\u2019s grave. She pulled the hat off her head and shook her hair down her back. Then she wiped at her eyes. Damn it, he thought. I told Jack she was still in that dark place.</p><p>He left the truck and, rather than going to the front door, he went out to the grave. As he came up behind her, she heard him and turned. Then she quickly turned back and wiped at her eyes with the back of her hand. He walked up behind her and put his arms around her waist. \u201cHaving one of those days?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery once in a while I just get so lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Vanni. It\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s worried about me coming out here to tell Matt about it.\u201d She laughed uncomfortably. \u201cHe wishes I wouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to do this,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not brooding. Really. Sometimes I can\u2019t think of anyone else to complain to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can always complain to me,\u201d he said.</p><p>She turned around and looked at him; for a moment her eyes flashed. \u201cAnd how am I supposed to do that? I hardly ever talk to you. I almost never see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I meant to do better. I know I went missing for a while after leaving here. It\u2019s complicated, Vanni. I can explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny more complicated than losing a husband?\u201d she snapped. \u201cOh God, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what got into me just now. My God, you lost your best friend\u2014I\u2019m sorry. Paul, you don\u2019t have to explain...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think I do. After we buried him and I stayed on for Mattie\u2014I was kind of like a grenade with the pin out. I hadn\u2019t unloaded, and man, I really needed to. I was a little out of my head, Vanni. I didn\u2019t use the best judgment. I had to take a time out, some space\u2014a few weeks. I had to get a grip on things, you know? And I didn\u2019t want everything between us to be about grieving over Matt. There\u2019s a lot more between us than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cWell, Jesus, we delivered a baby together.\u201d He rubbed a thumb along her cheek under her eye. \u201cSorry. My hands are so rough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNo. Your hands are fine. Do you have any idea how much I\u2019ve missed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot half as much as I missed you. We\u2019ve been through a lot together, you and me.\u201d He reached for her hand. He couldn\u2019t tell her now, here, in front of Matt\u2019s grave with the general waiting right inside the house. \u201cGo get cleaned up. Tom\u2019s probably got a big date tonight, but I\u2019m going to take you and your dad out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAnywhere special?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYour favorite bar and grill. I made a reservation.\u201d</p><p>By the time Paul got the general, Vanni and baby to the bar, the few customers were finishing up their early meals and leaving. Tables were pushed together and the usual crowd gathered around. The April nights were still cold, so the fire was lit in the hearth. Jack divided his time between the tables and his favorite spot behind the bar. Paul drifted back there and said, \u201cLook at your wife, my man. She\u2019s almost more baby than woman. And she\u2019s got a kind of wild look about her. Her cheeks are awful pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe just had a doctor\u2019s visit\u2014John Stone said if we turn her upside down we might see the color of Emma\u2019s eyes. Stand back. She\u2019s going to go early. I\u2019ve been driving myself crazy trying to keep her still. I\u2019d like to keep this one inside at least a couple more weeks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s real animated. Kind of like Vanni was that day she made me watch the childbirth movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m not experienced enough to know how early is too early. I thought about calling John...\u201d Then he smiled at Paul and said, \u201cI see you made it right down here. Good thinking. You make any progress with Vanni?\u201d</p><p>That changed Paul\u2019s expression. \u201cWhen I drove up to the house today I caught her out at the grave, crying. I told you\u2014she\u2019s still on real shaky ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy advice\u2014which, by the way, Mel says I am not, under pain of death allowed to give\u2014is be sure you\u2019re around when the ground stops shaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, I should talk to you about a couple of things. This whole business with Vanni\u2014it just keeps getting more complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, I have some pretty stiff competition...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? Join the club, my brother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. Mel\u2019s husband was a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cAn E.R. doctor. A saver of lives who, by all accounts, was also perfect in every other aspect of his life.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cHe was neat, smart, humorous and probably great in bed. A fucking god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t stand a chance, intellectually speaking,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cI know it,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnd yet...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you about a couple of things,\u201d Paul said. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll point me in the right direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, you don\u2019t need my input. You just have to tell her how you feel.\u201d</p><p>He hung his head briefly. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna be that simple. I think I might come by in the morning. So we can talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome by the house then,\u201d he said. \u201cI try not to get too far away these days. I haven\u2019t been coming into the bar until a little later in the morning.\u201d</p><p>When Paul sat beside Vanessa again, she looked at him with sparkling aquamarine eyes and he almost melted. His very next thought was how he\u2019d probably see those eyes flash in pure rage when he unburdened himself. She had a fire in her, and he\u2019d seen a hint of that earlier today, out by the grave. It caused a shudder to pass through him. Then he noticed her hand was resting on her thigh, right next to him, and he reached for it, holding it under the table.</p><p>It was still early when they got back to the general\u2019s house. Vanni took a little time alone with the baby, nursing him and settling him for the night. While she was busy, Walt built a fire. Then he went down the hall, leaving Paul alone in the great room.</p><p>Paul wanted a drink, but he didn\u2019t dare. He was afraid it would loosen him up, make him either talk too much or do too much. Then Vanni joined him. She\u2019d brushed out her hair and it fell in silky curves onto her shoulders, glistening in the firelight, making him want to scrunch it up in his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d she asked, curling up in the big leather chair beside his.</p><p>\u201cHe fixed up the fire and left the room,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of early for him to turn in, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll be right back. Can I get you anything? A nightcap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d he said a little nervously. \u201cSo\u2014rumor has it the doctor was here last week...\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cMel was right. If there\u2019s anything you want to keep secret, get out of this town!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want that to be a secret?\u201d he asked, lifting his brows.</p><p>\u201cNo reason for that,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cI didn\u2019t invite him. Yes, he came to town. I showed him around, had dinner at Jack\u2019s, took him for a ride. He\u2019s not great on a horse.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cHow is he off the horse?\u201d Paul heard himself ask.</p><p>She laughed at him, then said, \u201cCameron seems to be a very nice man. But then, we knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman in your position\u2014you\u2019d probably be very interested in someone like him,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, Paul, I have to admit, it\u2019s nice to finally have a man pay a little romantic attention to me. It\u2019s been a very long time. I know I haven\u2019t been widowed all that long\u2014but it\u2019s been almost a year since...\u201d Her voice trailed off and she looked away.</p><p>\u201cSince?\u201d he said, talking like a man who had had that drink.</p><p>She let her gaze drift back with a mysterious half smile on her lips. Vanni almost laughed, wondering how poor Paul would react if she said, \u201cSince someone melted my bones with an orgasm...\u201d A secret chuckle escaped her. Paul was sweet and affectionate, but far too taciturn. She reminded herself to treat him gently. He was very cautious with women. If he weren\u2019t, he\u2019d have been married years ago with a flock of children by now. \u201cSince anything, Paul,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, dropping his chin. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to get so personal...\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cPaul, you weren\u2019t this shy with me when I was delivering Mattie. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cVanni, Vanni...I have things to explain. Difficult things. I know I don\u2019t seem like the kind of guy who\u2019d have complications in his life. I seem more like the kind of guy who has no life at all. But before Matt...Before I came down here to finish Jack\u2019s house...I went out sometimes, you know?\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little. \u201cPaul, even though you never said anything, and I know you\u2019re kind of shy around women, I assumed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid,\u201d he said, interrupting. \u201cI\u2019m mostly stupid around women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncertain, maybe. But under the right circumstances...\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he said, almost relieved. \u201cUnder the right circumstances things can happen that you just don\u2019t expect.\u201d</p><p>She frowned slightly. \u201cPaul, I understand you went out with women. Why wouldn\u2019t you? You\u2019re a handsome, single man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about me being a little absent since Mattie was born...I have a situation to work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA situation in Grants Pass?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, rubbing a hand across the back of his sweaty neck. He took a breath. \u201cBefore I came down here last fall, I went out with a woman a couple of times. Just a casual thing. Nothing serious. But then the whole goddamn world shifted, Matt was killed, Mattie was due, I stayed here with you, we got a lot closer during that time. It might\u2019ve been all about Matt and the baby at first, but that\u2019s irrelevant\u2014we got real close. You and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs close as brother and sister?\u201d she asked him softly, hopeful about what could be coming.</p><p>\u201cA lot closer than that, Vanni. At least in my mind. Then I went back to Grants Pass and not that much had changed there. I had changed, boy had I changed, but things back home were...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same?\u201d she asked. And she thought, there\u2019s a woman in Grants Pass. Someone who had perhaps become important to him. \u201cThat woman you went out with a couple of times\u2014when did you meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, perplexed.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said, rubbing his sweaty palms on his jeans. \u201cI don\u2019t know. About a year ago, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year ago? Jesus, Paul. Why didn\u2019t you just tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a woman! All this time, there\u2019s been a woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No. There was just this woman I saw a couple of times and...\u201d</p><p>She stood up abruptly. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be complicated.\u201d</p><p>He stood, as well. \u201cI had a few things to figure out, Vanni\u2014that\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t in touch for a while. And now I have an...unexpected situation at home I have to work out, but I\u2019m going to get that under control and I\u2019ll be here a lot more, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d she spat out. \u201cJust say it. You\u2019re involved with someone and it doesn\u2019t work into your plans to spend time in Virgin River!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d he said nervously.</p><p>\u201cYou know everything about me! Yet you couldn\u2019t even casually mention you were seeing someone at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. Listen, I just need some time on this. Some patience. Because I really intend to do better by you than I have. I know I haven\u2019t been here for you like I meant to be and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t asked you for anything except to stay in touch! Stop whimpering!\u201d</p><p>He scowled. His neck got red. \u201cI\u2019m not whimpering!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you sure as hell aren\u2019t talking! Man up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying! But you\u2019re doing all the talking for me!\u201d</p><p>She had a few more hot retorts, but bit her tongue against them. She pursed her lips. He had been in Virgin River for months, but he went back to Grants Pass almost every week for a day or two. He had said it was to check on the construction company he\u2019d left in the hands of his father and brothers. And to check on her? It must\u2019ve been pretty hard on her to be asked to understand he had to be away so much, tending to his best friend\u2019s widow. Imagine now, being told he\u2019d have to make frequent trips to Virgin River to make sure the widow and baby were doing all right. Talk about complicated. Well, she wasn\u2019t interested in that kind of relationship. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019re trying to tell me there\u2019s a woman back in Grants Pass who\u2019s counting on you. You have obligations there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said weakly. \u201cBut, Vanni, I have obligations here, as well. You and Mattie, you\u2019re awful important to me...\u201d</p><p>Being referred to as an obligation should have made her want to cry, but instead it made her furious. \u201cWell, don\u2019t worry your little head. We\u2019re getting along just fine\u2014better every day. You have a life in Grants Pass. I wouldn\u2019t want to get in the way of that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not listening,\u201d he said, his voice raising to match hers. \u201cI want to be here with you, as often as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing my damn best!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like you have other things, other people you\u2019d better pay attention to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, things can happen that you don\u2019t plan, don\u2019t expect!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d she asked sarcastically. \u201cTell me about it,\u201d she said. She hadn\u2019t expected her husband to die, or to fall in love with Paul. If there was one thing she knew about the men in her life\u2014her father, her late husband, Paul and all the guys who seemed to gather around him\u2014they didn\u2019t make commitments lightly, and once a promise was made, they never broke an oath. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get everything straightened out,\u201d she said. She tried to keep the angry edge out of her voice, but she was thoroughly unsuccessful. \u201cPlease, you have no obligations here. We\u2019ll be fine. I don\u2019t know why you didn\u2019t just tell me\u2014a long time ago! Did you think I wouldn\u2019t understand you had to get home because there was someone there? Someone who was counting on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could have just told me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa! For God\u2019s sake\u2014\u201d Paul attempted.</p><p>Walt walked into the room. He looked stricken, startled. \u201cAre you having an argument about something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d they both said.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Walt said. \u201cPoetry, I guess. Some new kind of poetry?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa hissed and Paul just shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cI hear the baby,\u201d she said, whirling out of the room.</p><p>\u201cI hear something, too,\u201d Paul said, leaving in the opposite direction, charging out the front door and letting it slam behind him.</p><p>Walt was left alone in the great room in front of a blazing hearth. \u201cWell,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cGlad to know that wasn\u2019t an argument.\u201d</p><p>Vanni cursed herself. She\u2019d lost it. She hadn\u2019t given him much of a chance to explain, but then the time involved in him actually getting to the point might have taken a lifetime. She lay on her back on her bed, fully clothed, the back of her hand on her forehead. She kicked her feet furiously and groaned. She had a short fuse sometimes, she knew that. It rarely reared its ugly head like that, but Paul had frustrated her so much. How could you love and hate the same thing about a person? She adored that he was kind of shy and reluctant; that a woman had to mean everything in the world to him for him to speak at all, for him to embrace, smile, kiss. But she hated that he couldn\u2019t take charge! Stake his claim! He should have told her long before Mattie was born that there was a special woman in Grants Pass, and that he had to get back to her!</p><p>Vanni was not going to be like Nikki, hoping to change a man\u2019s mind. Or his feelings. More to the point, she wanted nothing to do with another woman\u2019s man!</p><p>Then, despite the fact that her cheeks were still hot with anger, she cried. Then damned herself for crying.</p><p>Paul had a hard time sleeping through the night. He\u2019d made a half-assed and totally unrehearsed attempt to explain things to Vanni and, in his bungling, left it undone, maybe worse. Of course, having the general right down the hall, maybe ready to walk into the room right at the moment Paul announced, \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant!\u201d didn\u2019t help. But that was no excuse.</p><p>He had to get this done, and the very thought curdled his stomach.</p> <p>If he was going to be a father he would be an involved father. He was more than committed to taking on little Matt and he hoped...no, he prayed, Vanni could accept his child as part of the package. But he had no idea how to go about telling her. Vanni scared him to death. She had a helluva temper.</p><p>It was just after dawn and the household was quiet. Paul dressed, made a pot of coffee and took a cup with him down to the stable, thinking of having a little morning chat with the horses. Maybe he could get some advice about the embarrassing fact that he was thirty-six years old and was still trying to figure out how to get close to a woman he\u2019d been in love with for years. Not to mention the fact that he had this little complication of another woman having his baby.</p><p>He was leaning against a stall when he heard a sound. He turned around and saw that the tack room door was ajar. His first thought was that the general might be up, so he pushed open the door. There, seated on the bench, elbows on his knees and head down, was Tom. His jacket was tossed over the bench beside him and his shirtsleeves were rolled up. \u201cHey,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>Tom lifted his head. His expression was troubled. \u201cHey,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou been out all night?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cI was out late, yeah. Then at Brenda\u2019s. I got home a couple of hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun?\u201d</p><p>Tom shuddered. It was unmistakable. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said in a breath. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, bud?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cJust thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Maybe if you think a little louder, I can help.\u201d</p><p>Tom studied him for a long moment. \u201cI sincerely doubt it, Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me. I\u2019m older. Maybe I\u2019ve been down this road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have and you\u2019re still single at thirty-six, I really don\u2019t want your advice,\u201d he said glumly.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s this? Thinking about marriage at eighteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Not quite that. It\u2019s just that...Brenda, man. Jesus, I love that girl. I didn\u2019t think I could love a person this much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound exactly like a bad thing so far. Unless she doesn\u2019t feel the same way...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d Tom said. His cheeks got a little pink and he shook his head. \u201cShe feels the same way. Whew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. You crossed that line, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d he said again. He stood up, turned around and ran sweaty palms down his pants. When he turned back to Paul he said. \u201cIt should come with a warning, you know?\u201d</p><p>Paul put a foot up on the bench and forced himself to take a leisurely sip of his steaming coffee, trying to get mentally ready for just anything. He hoped to God he and Tommy didn\u2019t share the same problem. \u201cOh, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I talk about this? Does it make me a real jerk to talk about this? Because I was always taught men don\u2019t talk about the women they...My dad always said a real man never talks about private things that happen with his girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t go any further. We\u2019re a long way from the locker room, Tom. I think I can be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that...Well, damn. She took her sweet time, you know? And I was real patient, even when I thought I was going out of my mind. But I just wouldn\u2019t have felt right if she wasn\u2019t sure. We had all the ground rules in place\u2014double protection, we did a lot of talking first, were totally sure how we felt about each other. I promised I would be totally faithful to her, only her, unless she changed her mind, but I\u2019m not changing mine. And she said the same thing to me. We love each other, Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured it would take a little time, you know. Getting used to. I figured it would go real slow, maybe be a little clumsy. At first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Paul asked, wondering what the hell this kid was getting at.</p><p>He ducked his head, then made eye contact. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t take any time at all. It isn\u2019t clumsy. It\u2019s freaking incredible. She\u2019s freaking incredible.\u201d</p><p>Paul shook his head in confusion. \u201cIs there a problem in here somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving pretty soon,\u201d he said. \u201cRight after graduation I go to basic, then West Point. For years.\u201d Then he hung his head.</p><p>\u201cAah,\u201d Paul said. So, the boy had tapped the honey pot and found it sweeter than life. He wanted that to be a part of every day for the rest of his life. And West Point was going to lock him up for four years\u2014you couldn\u2019t live away from the academy, couldn\u2019t graduate if you got married. \u201cYou won\u2019t be gone forever,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to seem like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet it will. But if she feels the same way you do, you have something very nice to look forward to. When the time\u2019s right.\u201d Paul took a sip of coffee. \u201cHey, man, even if you didn\u2019t have West Point, eighteen\u2019s just too young to do the forever thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it ever happen? Do people like me and Brenda fall in love as kids and stay together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappens more than you might think,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cMy buddy Zeke, firefighter from Fresno? Married his high school sweetheart and so far they have four kids. They managed to do that even with being separated by the Marine Corps for at least two years. Phillips and Stephens were married pretty young\u2014have nice little families. And they\u2019re still so crazy about their women, it\u2019s almost ridiculous. You\u2019d think they just met them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never expected this,\u201d Tom said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be so natural, so awesome. Makes me feel like I can\u2019t live without her. Makes me feel sick to my stomach to even think about her ever being with another guy. I can\u2019t imagine ever being with another girl. It just has me torn up inside.\u201d</p><p>Paul chuckled in spite of himself. \u201cTommy,\u201d he said, putting a strong hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the thing that makes the bucks lock horns, makes bulls tear down barn doors to get to the cow. Men go into battle for less. Makes you think you\u2019d risk anything, give up anything, lay awake at night in a cold sweat...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShew,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess that\u2019s what they mean when they say love hurts,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cNo, buddy, it doesn\u2019t. You just said so yourself\u2014it feels wonderful to love someone and to make love. Keep your focus\u2014separation hurts, breaking up hurts, infidelity hurts\u2014but love, man, that\u2019s what we live for. Because it feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Tom said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t look like you do.\u201d</p><p>Paul frowned and gave that shoulder a squeeze. \u201cI know. I just haven\u2019t worked out all the details yet.\u201d</p><p>At nine Paul threw his duffel in the back of his truck. He shook Tom\u2019s hand and told him to hang in there, shook the general\u2019s hand and thanked him for his hospitality, and after checking Vanni\u2019s eyes and seeing that she had softened and wasn\u2019t going to bite him or kick him, he slipped an arm around her waist, kissed her forehead and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to call you when I get back to Grants Pass tonight. We have some things to talk about. Maybe without the yelling part.\u201d</p><p>She turned her sparkling turquoise eyes up to his face and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>Before heading up the highway to Oregon, Paul took a swing by Mel and Jack\u2019s. He knocked softly on the door and Jack answered, David still in his pajamas balanced on his hip. \u201cMorning,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHeading out of town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But if you have a few minutes, I need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. We can sit out here so we don\u2019t wake Mel. She was up half the night with her back hurting and she\u2019s sleeping in. I have coffee. Want a cup?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat would be great,\u201d he said, though he\u2019d already had enough coffee to screw up his nerves pretty good.</p><p>Jack handed off David to Paul while he went for coffee and a bowl of dry Cheerios for his son. They settled in the Adirondack chairs, looking out over the valley below. David sat on the porch floor with his bowl of cereal between his legs.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look too good,\u201d Jack said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not too good. I\u2019ve really messed things up. After little Matt was born, after I went home, I was pretty shook up. All those months of hanging in there with Vanni and not really taking any time to grieve my best friend took a toll, I guess. Might\u2019ve vented a little bit. There\u2019s this girl back in Grants Pass...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou vent on this girl?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI vented in her. She\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, holy shit. That was brilliant. What were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we were protected. I\u2019d been with her a couple of times before. You know\u2014before Matt was killed. How impressed are you with my timing, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to support her, naturally. She\u2019s having the baby, so I\u2019m going to do my part. I\u2019m not going to marry her because I don\u2019t...Aw hell, I wouldn\u2019t be doing her any favors. I met her in a bar a while back\u2014little over a year ago. I wasn\u2019t seeing her regularly. I feel terrible about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your best advice, bud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow pregnant is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happened after I got back to Grants Pass. A couple of months now. I\u2019m going to have to tell Vanni. Pretty soon. I tried last night, but I screwed up. And even without knowing the details, she flipped out, tore my head off just thinking I had a girl back home I hadn\u2019t mentioned. Man, that woman has a real short fuse. She\u2019s going to kill me. No figure of speech here\u2014she\u2019s good with a gun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHold on there,\u201d Jack said. \u201cOne thing at a time. You should probably get yourself tested for STDs\u2014do that tomorrow. If you used protection, I don\u2019t know...maybe there\u2019s a chance this baby isn\u2019t yours...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought of that. Thing is, she says she hadn\u2019t been with a guy for so long, she got a little lazy with the pills and I used a condom I\u2019d been carrying around for months...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe suggest marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that was the first thing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Einstein\u2014what if she\u2019s not even pregnant, huh? Outside chance, but possible. Before you make a lifetime commitment to support someone you don\u2019t know very well, you better get all the facts. Just don\u2019t move too fast here, pal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta call Vanni tonight, and tell her. I\u2019ve got her all confused and totally furious...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, you can\u2019t tell her on the phone,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPaul! She\u2019s gonna hang up on you! And then the next time you show your face, she\u2019s going to put a bullet in your head. And Walt will help her line up her shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what am I gonna do? Huh? She thinks I have a woman back home\u2014she wouldn\u2019t give me a chance to explain any\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mel appeared in the doorway, her robe covering her huge pregnant tummy. Her face was freshly scrubbed, but her hair was mussed from sleep. She gave Paul a smile, then went to Jack, sitting on his lap.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she said to Paul. \u201cI heard that. I can\u2019t wait to hear why you\u2019re going to be shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, man...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Jack said. \u201cReally, this is the person you should talk to. And she never tells. It\u2019s infuriating.\u201d</p><p>Paul went through the facts slowly, embarrassingly. It made his neck red. He was not able to make much eye contact with Mel while he spoke, but at the end of the story he was amazed to look into her crystal-blue eyes and find they weren\u2019t wide with shock. \u201cI guess you\u2019ve heard it all, huh?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cPretty much. This must be very difficult for you, Paul,\u201d Mel said. \u201cYou\u2019re worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. I guess your first concern is whether you\u2019re actually the father of this baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I figure I am\u2014but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should probably verify that as soon as possible. Remember, Paul\u2014the lady knows who the mother is. You\u2019re entitled to the same assurance. Ask her to offer that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d he said pleadingly. \u201cHow in God\u2019s name do you suggest I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn an honest and straightforward manner,\u201d she said. \u201cYou might be able to learn something from an ultrasound. It will at least show exactly how pregnant she is, and if you can narrow down the times you were in contact\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime,\u201d he said. \u201cJust one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know exactly how pregnant she is and an ultrasound will either verify or dispute the gestation. But if there was another partner involved at approximately the same time, it will require a paternity test. Blood types, DNA, etcetera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to upset her. Offend her.\u201d</p><p>Mel smiled patiently. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2014the two of you didn\u2019t have a conversation for six months and when you did, it escalated to intimacy rather quickly\u2014do I have that right? Paul, if she\u2019s offended by your desire to be sure you\u2019re the father of this baby before you commit yourself personally and financially, you\u2019re not going to have an easy time with this. It\u2019s a very reasonable request. If she\u2019s absolutely certain, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll cooperate with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she doesn\u2019t?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTell her you\u2019ll hire a lawyer to assert your paternal rights. She can be prevented from aborting or having the baby adopted, and you will be obligated to support your child, which I assume you\u2019re prepared to do anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s having my baby, I\u2019ll take care of her. Of course.\u201d</p><p>Mel smiled. \u201cOf course you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Vanni?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Mel said. \u201cShe\u2019s not taking it well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know. I tried to tell her last night and I got as far as telling her I dated a woman in Grants Pass when she came unhinged because I hadn\u2019t told her sooner.\u201d</p><p>Mel made a face. \u201cTake care of that, Paul. If you have feelings for Vanessa, it isn\u2019t fair to leave her confused and wondering. She deserves the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to shoot me in the head,\u201d he said miserably.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that. She might need time to consider the facts, however.\u201d Then she smiled patiently. \u201cPaul, you\u2019ve played around with this long enough. If you care about her, assert yourself. Explain. You didn\u2019t betray her\u2014you didn\u2019t break the law. You have to behave responsibly toward both women\u2014that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThis will work out. Babies are miracles of life\u2014no matter the extenuating circumstances. Don\u2019t lose sight of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said again. He leaned toward her, kissed her brow as she sat on her husband\u2019s lap. \u201cThanks, Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cBest of luck.\u201d</p><p>He shook Jack\u2019s hand, ruffled David\u2019s floppy golden hair and headed for his truck. Once he\u2019d turned around and was headed off the Sheridan property, Mel looked at Jack to find him grinning hugely. \u201cMelinda,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you just get involved in someone\u2019s relationship?\u201d</p><p>She lifted a brow. \u201cDo you really want to mess with a woman who\u2019s about seventeen months pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry shutting up,\u201d she advised. \u201cI believe I was asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d he laughed. \u201cYou got right in there, got your hands dirty in someone\u2019s relationship. Just admit it\u2014it\u2019s irresistible. You\u2019re just as nosy as I am.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cJack, no one is as nosy as you are.\u201d</p><p>Right after Paul left, the phone rang at Jack\u2019s house. He knew who it was; it was a regular Sunday morning call. He lifted Mel off his lap and dashed for the phone, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>There had been a boy in Virgin River who was like a son to Jack. Ricky. He\u2019d taken him under his wing when he was only thirteen because it was just Rick and his grandmother. Jack taught him to hunt and fish, did what he could to teach him the ways of the world. He\u2019d pridefully watched as he grew tall and strong, a young man of impeccable character who could take the toughest stuff life could serve up and hold his head up, stand straight and do a man\u2019s job. The boy had gotten close to Preacher, to Mel, to the Marines from Jack\u2019s old squad who still gathered there.</p><p>At eighteen Ricky had signed up. What was the young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of a bunch of tough old Marines going to do but sign up? And Semper Fi suited him. Ricky had excelled. He\u2019d gone from Basic to Airborne to Sniper training to Reconnaissance training to SERE\u2014Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape training. In every program he\u2019d been the best. He was nineteen years old and at least six feet of proud, muscled, skilled Marine. He just phoned to say he had ten days of leave coming up in a couple of months.</p><p>And then he had orders for Iraq.</p><p>\u201cNo sniveling, Jack,\u201d Rick said. \u201cI want you to remember when you were going\u2014you didn\u2019t want your parents and your sisters acting like you were walking into a grave, right? So\u2014we\u2019ll have a drink. Maybe smoke one of those nasty cigars you and Preach like so much. Tell some dirty jokes. I might even let you cheat me out of some money at poker...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, kid. It\u2019ll be great. I\u2019ll even call some of the boys...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, they don\u2019t have to come. They\u2019re your boys, not mine. And there\u2019s no hunting now anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. Virgin River\u2019s going to want to celebrate you a little bit. We only send our best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d</p><p>Jack straightened his spine, took a deep breath and told himself they were going to have to make his leave in Virgin River memorable and positive\u2014there\u2019d be no whining and worrying. After all, Jack had gone into war five times and the only really bad injury he\u2019d sustained was a pretty miserable shot in the ass. Not everyone who went to war came out crippled. Or dead. Rick was sharp. And this was what Rick wanted.</p><p>Ricky had grown up too fast. He lost his parents in an accident when he was so young, he didn\u2019t even remember them. At sixteen he\u2019d fallen ass over teakettle in love with a girl two years younger than him and they\u2019d had a baby together, a baby that hadn\u2019t lived.</p><p>Mel came into the kitchen to find Jack leaning on the counter, looking down. He lifted his gaze. \u201cRicky\u2019s coming home in a couple of months,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s got ten days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-oh,\u201d she said, knowing something was bad about this.</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019s going to Iraq.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment. Her eyes misted over. She pursed her lips and then said, \u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>P aul stopped off for dinner on his way into Grants Pass, took a run by his office to check messages and any paperwork that might be left on his desk. There were a couple messages from Terri asking him to call. When he finally got home, it was after seven and he found a few messages from Terri on his home phone, left over the weekend, asking him to call her. Then the last one\u2014all upset, full of tears and little gasping breaths, saying she couldn\u2019t stand feeling so ignored, so alone. She mumbled something about maybe it just wasn\u2019t worth it. The time of the last call on the caller ID showed the call came in only an hour ago. He dialed her number and there was no answer, so he flew out the door and drove to her apartment. Aw, Jesus, don\u2019t do this, he was thinking all the way there. Don\u2019t go crazy on me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She opened the door to his knock; her eyes and nose were red, her cheeks chapped, like maybe she\u2019d been crying all day. She took one look at him and turned, walking back into her apartment, leaving the door open with him standing there. He followed her and stood in her small living room as she whirled around, flopped on the couch, drew her feet up and cried into a tissue.</p><p>\u201cTerri, what\u2019s going on? Why didn\u2019t you answer your phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI turned it off,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would you leave me a message like that and then turn off your phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she said, blowing her nose. \u201cI left a lot of messages\u2014and you ignored them all. I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore, waiting for the phone to ring. It was agony. What\u2019s the point in giving me all your phone numbers if you weren\u2019t going to take my calls?\u201d</p><p>He sat down beside her on the couch, but he didn\u2019t get too close. \u201cWe had lunch last week,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything was okay. Are you having problems with the pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m having problems! As in, I have no one to talk to and it gets damn lonely!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was out of town,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t call in for messages.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd your cell phone was turned off?\u201d she asked hotly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no signal where I went\u2014I didn\u2019t even carry it with me. I left it in the truck all weekend. I was in Virgin River, in the mountains. I\u2019m sorry\u2014I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d need me. And I still don\u2019t know why you thought you needed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was upset! Didn\u2019t you say you were in this with me? I needed someone who was on my side to talk to. What if something worse was wrong? How long would it take you to notice? Maybe I should just get rid of it\u2014it would be less trouble for you.\u201d</p><p>He reached over and touched her knee. He gave it a squeeze. \u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to have it?\u201d she asked him. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t exactly act like it.\u201d</p><p>Paul felt an angry heat rise up his neck to his face. \u201cIf you had wanted an abortion, you would have done that already. I\u2019d never have known. Don\u2019t threaten it now to keep me in line.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod, I just felt so abandoned...\u201d Her face melted into a pathetic, contorted mess of wrinkles. She buried her face in her tissue and let it go for a minute. Resigned, he scooted closer and pulled her against him, holding her while she cried on his chest. \u201cSo\u2014what\u2019s in Virgin River that keeps you from even thinking about us up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a grip now,\u201d he said, not answering the question. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you go through this alone. I didn\u2019t know you needed anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best. But we\u2019d better establish some boundaries. I\u2019m not going to let you do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m in this with you\u2014I\u2019ll coparent and pay support. I\u2019m grateful you\u2019re willing to have the baby, but I\u2019m not going to be manipulated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I give it away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you give it away, you\u2019ll be giving it to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo take to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d he asked, startled.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be a woman. Otherwise you\u2019d give us a chance.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. It couldn\u2019t really be that simple, could it? \u201cListen to me,\u201d he said. He grabbed her chin and turned her face so he could look into those swollen, wet eyes. \u201cThis has to do with me and you\u2014and the fact that even though we\u2019re not a couple, we\u2019re having a child together. We have to figure out how to make that work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there is,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere is,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut even if there weren\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there is,\u201d she said.</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cThere might not be, after she hears about this. But that won\u2019t change anything between us. Terri, I\u2019m sorry\u2014I\u2019m fond of you, I care about you, I swear I\u2019ll do my best by you, but I don\u2019t love you. There are three people involved here\u2014you, me, a baby. It wouldn\u2019t be good for any of us to try to make a marriage where there isn\u2019t real bone deep, passionate love. I wouldn\u2019t give us a year\u2014and that would be worse than what we have.\u201d He ran a knuckle down her cheek. \u201cBelieve me.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet a moment. \u201cYou said there was no one,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhen we met, when we...You said there was no one in your life...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s real complicated,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut you cheated on her. When she finds out you cheated, she\u2019s going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerri, I didn\u2019t cheat on her, all right? I told you the truth. I wasn\u2019t with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Did you just meet her? After we\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, listen to me. We weren\u2019t together. I knew I had real strong feelings for her, but we weren\u2019t together when I met you and I had no reason to hope we ever would be. She had no idea how I felt. I told you the truth\u2014I wasn\u2019t with a woman and I didn\u2019t want a serious relationship. You said the same thing\u2014you were unattached and liked it that way.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a long moment. \u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>He glanced away. \u201cThings changed. Lots of things changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she said, falling into a fresh round of tears. \u201cOh God, your friend\u2019s wife! The one who just died!\u201d</p><p>Oh, he thought, this is going to be so much worse than I ever imagined. I swear to God, I\u2019m never having sex again. \u201cDon\u2019t come unglued on me like this,\u201d he said softly. \u201cListen, there will be times I can\u2019t be there for you\u2014times we\u2019re not in touch. There has to be someone you can talk to when you\u2019re upset and you can\u2019t find me. What about your mother? Is she someone you can talk to about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she said with a sniff. \u201cShe thinks I\u2019m crazy to go through with this. She doesn\u2019t believe for one second you\u2019ll be a part of it.\u201d</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you to meet her, help explain what I\u2019m able to do to help. That might put her mind at ease a little bit.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and looked up at him. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. After we\u2019ve seen the doctor together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do we have to do that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI have some questions for the doctor. I want to make sure everything is going well. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll ask a few questions about your health, the baby\u2019s health, insurance, that sort of thing. Once you get through the early months, we\u2019ll see your mother and I\u2019ll reassure her that I\u2019m going to support you. Who\u2019s your doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should make sure you have the best.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlene Weir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s your next appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a while. I just went. Just before I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cThree, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You be sure to give me the date of the next appointment, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell me your questions and I\u2019ll get the answers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, brushing her hair back from her face. \u201cI want to go. I want to be a part of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, a sentimental look in her eyes. \u201cWill you stay with me tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Terri. It\u2019s about those boundaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m going to get pregnant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerri\u2014you want me in this with you or not? I told you, I\u2019ll be an involved father and I\u2019ll support you the best I can. I hope we can cooperate, work together, be friends. I\u2019d like us to do a good job with this\u2014but we\u2019re not a couple, and we\u2019re not going to be intimate anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d she whispered, leaning against him to cry some more. \u201cI have myself so upset I can\u2019t eat, I can\u2019t sleep. It\u2019s like you feel completely different about me because I got pregnant, and it\u2019s not my fault!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. Since we were both taking precautions, it\u2019s not really anyone\u2019s fault, but it\u2019s still a responsibility we both have. You\u2019re going to have to settle down and be more rational. This isn\u2019t good for you or the baby. Try to calm down a little, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just so hard,\u201d she said. \u201cWe might not have been together that much, but when we were, it was wonderful. We got along, we liked each other. I thought when you knew we\u2019d made a baby, you\u2019d at least give us a try. But man\u2014you won\u2019t even think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, honey...We liked each other fine, got along great, had fun\u2014four whole times in a year. I think it takes a lot more than that to make a successful marriage. Besides, if there was potential for it to be any more serious than it is, we\u2019d have known a long time ago. But you know what I\u2019d like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, turning her face up to look at him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be parents together. Not under the same roof, but still\u2014we have to do this as a team. I\u2019d like it if we could do that as friends. Two people who might not have what it takes to be a couple, but have everything we need to be good parents. That\u2019s going to take some practice, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said with a weary sigh. \u201cLots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat woman,\u201d she said with a sniff. \u201cDid you know you loved her right away?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cRight away,\u201d he said, his arm around her.</p><p>Terri was quiet for a moment. Then she said, \u201cI guess you probably know exactly how I feel.\u201d</p><p>He thought it made as much sense for Terri to think herself in love with him after a couple of one-night stands as it did for him to be in love with Vanni the second he laid eyes on her. And Vanni had been as unavailable to him as he was to Terri.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said to Terri. \u201cLet\u2019s lay down on the bed, see if you can calm down enough to rest. I can\u2019t stay the night, though. You understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t like it, but I get it. I\u2019m not usually this crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s quiet you and the baby down, then I\u2019m going to leave and go home. You feeling a little better yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just no way for us, is there, Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a way for us to have this baby and be good parents, Terri. In my mind, that\u2019s a lot.\u201d</p><p>First thing Monday morning the phone rang at the Booth household, and Vanessa lunged for it. It was Cameron and she let out a disappointed sigh that she hoped he wouldn\u2019t interpret. The man she\u2019d been thinking about was Paul. She\u2019d been worrying about him. Frantically, in fact. He hadn\u2019t called as promised and by ten o\u2019clock the night before she\u2019d left messages for him at his home and office, getting no response. She\u2019d hardly slept, afraid he\u2019d been hurt or killed on the drive home. It didn\u2019t feel good to have something between them yet to be resolved.</p><p>She collected herself. \u201cWell, hello, Cameron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, thanks. And you?\u201d She chewed her lip a little bit. Why couldn\u2019t this just be Paul?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. Listen, I know Virgin River is perfection, but I was wondering if you\u2019d like to get out of town for a weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA weekend?\u201d she asked, completely unprepared for such a question. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a great seaside hotel in Mendocino, on the ocean. Lots to do around there. Very relaxing and entertaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron, I have a baby.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI thought maybe I could bring along a pediatrician.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, Cameron, I\u2019m really not ready for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, Vanni. We\u2019ll get two rooms. Think of it as a chance to get to know each other better, that\u2019s all. And no, I have not mentioned my plans to Carol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Listen\u2014I appreciate the invitation, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for something like a weekend date. That\u2019s moving a little fast for me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be a Boy Scout,\u201d he laughed. \u201cTwo rooms, good views, great food, a little relaxation, conversation, no pressure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the thought, really. It\u2019s very nice of you, but...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was worth a try. Well, then, can I wrangle another run down to Virgin River? I have Jack\u2019s phone number. I could make a reservation at that little cabin...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome anytime,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe this weekend, since I scheduled it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said without enthusiasm. \u201cLet me know if you decide to come down.\u201d</p><p>It was another tense hour before the phone rang and this time it was Paul. She nearly bit his head off. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t get your message until this morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForget the message\u2014I didn\u2019t ask you to call! You said you were going to! I was afraid something terrible might have happened. I worried half the night!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething unexpected came up. I had to, ah, just help out a friend with something. I was home too late to call you. I didn\u2019t even check the messages until this morning.\u201d</p><p>She sighed heavily. It wasn\u2019t like her to panic, but she\u2019d had far too many losses over the past few years, and Paul felt like one more. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t said...\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, I\u2019m sorry. That will never happen again.\u201d</p><p>Taking care of the widow again, she thought. He got home, got sidetracked by the woman in Grants Pass and she was the last thing on his mind. How could he be any more clear? Still, she heard herself ask, \u201cWhat was the problem that sidetracked you until so late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, it wasn\u2019t anything. Not as serious as it sounded at first. I\u2019ll tell you all about it, Vanni, but I\u2019d rather do it in person. I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your keeper,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a private life, as you tried to explain...\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, I don\u2019t want you to get the wrong idea here...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt I have the wrong idea,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Paul. I\u2019m glad everything is okay. We\u2019ll catch up later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you this week,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you on the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. She hung up the phone and went to her bedroom. She sat on the edge of her bed. She could tell by the nervous sound in his voice\u2014he hadn\u2019t been home too late to call\u2014he hadn\u2019t been home at all. He spent the night with the woman. The woman who had complicated his life.</p><p>We have things to talk about.... Those were his parting words, along with the promise to call. That thing he wanted to talk about\u2014it would be an explanation about his relationship in Grants Pass, as if she needed more of his lame attempts. What did she expect, really? He had a life before Matt was killed, before Vanessa needed him, and that life went on. She had to find a way to let go of this, of him. If she didn\u2019t, it was going to tear her apart. Worse, it would tear Paul apart because more than anything, he was faithful to Matt.</p><p>The best thing she could do for herself, for Paul, was attempt to get on with her life.</p><p>She remembered back to those old flying days when she and Nikki got each other through a dozen bad boyfriends, the pain and disappointment. \u201cRaise your right hand and repeat after me,\u201d Nikki would say. \u201cI will not be pitiful! I will not be pathetic!\u201d</p><p>She checked little Matt to find he was still sleeping. She wiped at her eyes. It was so ridiculous to cry\u2014it had been very clear for a long time. Paul was devoted to her, bonded with her in some special ways. Probably her best friend. He was loving and affectionate and genuinely cared about her\u2014but it wasn\u2019t romantic. It never had been. She\u2019d better get over it.</p><p>One thing she absolutely couldn\u2019t take\u2014Cameron and Paul both in Virgin River for the weekend\u2014Cameron trying to seduce her, Paul shyly and clumsily trying to find a way to tell her he had a girlfriend. Chinese water torture would be sweeter.</p><p>She went back to the great room and sat beside the phone for a few minutes, thinking. She picked up the receiver and dialed. \u201cCameron? Yes, I\u2019ve been thinking about it and a little trip to the coast might be just what I need. Mattie and I would love to go. But it\u2019ll have to be two rooms. And only if you\u2019re sure you want to do this with no expectations. I don\u2019t want to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand your position, Vanessa,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just have a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds so nice. Can we make it early on Saturday and home Sunday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d And she hung up.</p><p>She looked at Walt, whose newspaper was folded into his lap. He stared at her over the top of his reading glasses. \u201cVanessa, just what the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...ah...I\u2019m going on a little weekend trip with Cameron. I\u2019ll be taking the baby, of course.\u201d</p><p>He had heard her side of all three conversations and she knew it. \u201cThere seems to be a lot more to the story here...\u201d he said. \u201cFighting with Paul? Making a date with this doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing, Dad,\u201d she answered. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a problem with me going away for a weekend, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a grown woman,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPaul will be coming down for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to be here to see him?\u201d</p><p>She stood up. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming to see me. I think I\u2019ll just go for a quick ride, if you don\u2019t mind listening for the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt the horse.\u201d</p><p>If Cameron had hoped to impress and charm Vanessa, he certainly was on the right track. First of all, he borrowed his brother\u2019s SUV so that the car seat and stroller would fit. She had some misgivings about going away with him for the weekend, especially when her motivation was mostly to avoid Paul. But he entertained her with stories on their drive to the coast\u2014growing up with a brother and sister close to his age, fraternity pranks, med school horror stories that made her laugh in spite of herself. She was immediately comfortable, enjoying herself, and decided there were some perks involved in avoiding Paul.</p><p>He took her to a motel that resembled a country inn; they entered rooms on the parking lot side while the back of each room opened up onto a quaint, sheltered and private patio with table and chairs that faced the ocean cliffs. Lush pots full of geraniums sat around full green ferns and daisy beds that bordered the patios. In Vanessa\u2019s room, which was joined to Cam\u2019s, were fresh flowers and fruit.</p><p>After lunch at a sweet little seaside restaurant, they put the baby in the stroller and walked along the cliffs above the ocean, finally spreading a blanket under a full, leafy tree. They talked about their youth, their pasts, their experiences, their likes and dislikes. \u201cYou have a real way about you,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cI bet the mothers who bring their children to you fall in love with you all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just waiting for the right one to fall in love with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou were never even tempted to get married?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThere were a couple of close calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019ve had a million girlfriends,\u201d she said.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat might be giving me too much credit,\u201d he said. \u201cOr not enough, I don\u2019t know which. I\u2019ve had some girlfriends. And many more attempts that didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. You\u2019re picky.\u201d</p><p>He lifted an amused eyebrow. \u201cMaybe they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. Haven\u2019t you been in love a hundred times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite. Not counting high school and college when I was in love with a different girl every week, the first one hit me in med school. I had it bad for another med student. It was very hot, very intense, very brief. Very painful. Took me off the market for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019d take you for the heartbreaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI realized that up to that point I\u2019d been attracted, but not in love. I had my share of flings, but this woman I went to pieces over. I was all of twenty-four and I could\u2019ve made the promises\u2014all of them. She was with another guy before I knew what hit me. Then another and another. I lost track of her during internship when I heard she was with the senior resident in her program. My pride suffered a major blow, not to mention my perspective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were more?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI lived with a woman once\u2014but not for long. I don\u2019t think we made it three months. That was my only attempt at that.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI was twenty-nine and it seemed like I ought to at least make an effort to have a stable, monogamous relationship. It was awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwful? What went wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, first of all, it wasn\u2019t stable. She turned out to be crazy.\u201d Then he smiled.</p><p>\u201cReally? I mean, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just wouldn\u2019t believe it. A total loose cannon. She threw things at me and everything. I almost went deaf from her screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou moved in with her without knowing that?\u201d</p><p>His cheeks took on a rosy stain. \u201cI probably should\u2019ve guessed, but I was in denial.\u201d He laughed. \u201cBecause she was really...\u201d He swallowed. \u201cBecause she was very sexy. I thought I could handle anything if I could just...\u201d His voice dwindled away.</p><p>\u201cWhat men will do,\u201d Vanni said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Guilty. Did you ever live with anyone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNever. The closest I came was when I was going with my husband, I traveled from San Francisco to Camp Pendleton to spend every weekend with him while he was still stateside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn college,\u201d he said. \u201cWho were you in love with in college?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cBret McDoughal. Captain of the football team, president of the debate club. I really expected him to be a senator by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sells used cars in Virginia. He makes sleazy, late-night commercials and wears his hair in some kind of weird pompadour. In college, he looked like he was going to take over the world. I was nuts about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d he let you get away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of girls were nuts about him. He had a very short attention span.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a dope,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, I think I made a very slim escape there,\u201d she said, laughing.</p><p>He reached out and covered her hand with his. \u201cCan you tell me about Matt? Is that too hard for you to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I like to talk about him,\u201d she said, and resisted the memory that made one of the things about her relationship with Paul so comfortable\u2014they could share memories. \u201cMatt was a wonderful man, a great friend. He was so funny, so full of energy. What snagged me immediately was his sense of humor\u2014he made me laugh till I cried. And there were other things about him\u2014like his commitment to the Marine Corps, his commitment to his buddies, his boys as he called them\u2014that filled me with admiration. His commitment to me,\u201d she added, somewhat quietly. \u201cHe was single-minded when it came to the things he cared about. And he was strong\u2014not just physically. Emotionally strong, too. But you should\u2019ve seen his arms and shoulders. He could do pull-ups and push-ups all day long.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBig, like all those Virgin River men,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she said. \u201cBroad shouldered but not even six feet. When I wore heels, we were the same height. Dark haired, like you. Blue eyes, like yours. Tender and sensitive and easy to talk to.\u201d She got a little misty. \u201cSometimes I really miss him. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her, sneaking up on her, and placed a soft kiss on her cheek. \u201cNever be sorry. It sounds like you had something special. You wouldn\u2019t want to not have had that. Especially with the little guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, yes. I\u2019m getting to the point where I can appreciate that\u2014that I had him in my life, that I have his son. I\u2019m grateful I had at least that much rather than never having known him.\u201d She inhaled sharply and looked out at the ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s nice of you\u2014not avoiding that subject. Not pretending he wasn\u2019t...isn\u2019t a part of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa, he\u2019s going to be a part of your life forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know if I take comfort in that or not.\u201d She looked back at him and smiled. \u201cBut I\u2019m grateful, understand. For Matt, the baby\u2014everything but the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like a shower before dinner and you could probably use a little time alone with your baby. Maybe a nap.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cThat might be in order. What time is dinner?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrinks at six-thirty, dinner at seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re eating in. It\u2019s going to be special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn?\u201d she asked. \u201cSpecial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce you get Mattie settled, we\u2019ll have a catered dinner on the patio so you\u2019ll be able to hear him if he wakes. Don\u2019t panic,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t have ulterior motives\u2014there\u2019s going to be a waiter present most of the time. I\u2019m not trying to trap you. Impress you, yes. Trap you, no.\u201d</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t see Terri at all that week, but he called her twice to ask her how she was, and he kept the conversations short. He\u2019d been planning to go to Virgin River, but then he got a call from Joe explaining about Jack and Preacher\u2019s add-on, and the need for a builder\u2019s opinion. This was perfect because it gave a professional purpose to the trip but he knew Terri would realize there was more to Virgin River than a construction job. He promised to call her during the weekend to make sure she was doing all right, but he didn\u2019t give her the general\u2019s number where he could be reached. This time, he would call for messages.</p> <p>But she surprised him by saying, \u201cHave a nice weekend, Paul.\u201d And he was so grateful that he suggested he might try to see her the following week, maybe for a lunch. And she said, \u201cThat would be nice, Paul.\u201d</p><p>When he got to the general\u2019s house on Saturday, Vanni was not there, and Walt was wearing a very annoyed expression.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t mention she\u2019d be away this weekend,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t, did she?\u201d the general said. \u201cYet, I\u2019m not sure why. You have any intel on that, son?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI told her I was coming. I think she was angry with me for forgetting to call her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone away for the weekend with the pediatrician,\u201d Walt announced.</p><p>\u201cGod damn! Sir,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what you mean.\u201d Walt turned away from him.</p> <p>\u201cSir, maybe I can explain this misunderstanding,\u201d Paul attempted.</p><p>The general waved him off. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard way too much already, and I don\u2019t want to be any more confused. Seems about time you explained whatever it is to Vanessa, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yes, sir. Ah, I have to go into town, see Jack and Preacher about building onto that bar. How\u2019d you like to come along?\u201d</p><p>He turned back. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019d like to do just that.\u201d</p><p>By the time Paul and Walt got to the bar, the lunch crowd was finishing up. Both of them needed a beer, both for the same reason, though they didn\u2019t discuss it. Walt had no idea what was going on with his daughter, but he\u2019d been real close to her for thirty years and he smelled a broken heart, yet she\u2019d gone away with the doctor. As for Paul, he was sure his complete ineptness was causing him to lose her. Again.</p><p>After Jack served them up a couple of cold drafts, Paul said, \u201cJoe tells me you\u2019re planning some building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fact,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe have to make room for Preacher\u2019s family. Now that he\u2019s figured out how to make the babies, he wants a house big enough to fill up with kids.\u201d Jack took a sip from his coffee mug. \u201cThey like it here. They like working together, living right on the property, running things their way. Makes sense to me, and Joe says it\u2019s easily done. He left some sketches, but doesn\u2019t have plans yet. He needs a builder to check out beams and foundation, etcetera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d Paul said. \u201cYou have someone in mind for building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a problem around here. Until recently, there\u2019s not been too much demand so our general contractors are few and far between. Remember, I couldn\u2019t find one who could go to work within a year, but we sure have plenty of crew looking for construction jobs. And, there\u2019s been a development.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike and Brie. They\u2019ve been looking for a house for months\u2014nothing that works for them has come on the market. My plot\u2019s big\u2014I can give them a parcel and they can build their own place. They\u2019ll be talking to Joe soon about a design. But they\u2019re sitting in that RV, trying to start their own family, needing space, and they have the same problem\u2014a serious lack of builders.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThis is one of those times I wish you lived in Virgin River, Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see the sketches,\u201d Paul said, changing the subject.</p><p>Jack reached under the bar and pulled out a large sheaf of rolled papers, clipped together at one corner. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty rough sketches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI\u2019m used to his scrawls and squiggles. He does manage to invent new abbreviations regularly, though. To challenge me, I think. Preacher in back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s cleaning up after lunch.\u201d</p><p>Paul grinned. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get started. Take care of the general, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I need taking care of?\u201d Walt asked. \u201cI\u2019m as happy right now as I\u2019ve been all week.\u201d</p><p>Paul drank about half of his beer, flipping through the sketches, then dragged himself off the stool and wandered into the kitchen.</p><p>Paul knew the bar like the back of his hand, but to do the architect justice, he looked at it with a builder\u2019s eyes. He scribbled over Joe\u2019s notes. He walked through the apartment and upstairs, then stopped in the middle of the small living quarters on the ground floor. He thought with the second floor and loft added, it could handle an open-beamed ceiling over their new great room, with a fireplace. Then he walked around outside.</p><p>Before Paul could escape back to the bar, Mike saw him prowling around the yard right outside Preacher\u2019s quarters where the extension would be anchored. He walked across the yard from the RV. \u201cHey, Paul, did Jack tell you we\u2019re looking at building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Paul said with a nod. \u201cProbably a good idea, if you\u2019re not finding anything you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure would be great if I already knew the builder and his work,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I work in Grants Pass now,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cThere must be at least one incentive to taking a job around here,\u201d Mike said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cI love this place, you know that. But I have commitments in Grants Pass. I left my dad and brothers for a long time while I was here last autumn.\u201d And, thought, those commitments included a pregnancy. Maybe, just maybe, Virgin River would be a more strategic place to sit it out. He could keep in touch with Terri by phone rather than having her expect him to be available to her. It would help with the matter of not giving her false hope. \u201cTell you what, I\u2019ll definitely think about it. But there are a lot of factors.\u201d Not the least of which was Vanessa Rutledge.</p><p>Six</p><p>A t only two and a half months, little Matt had become a very cooperative travel companion. After his stroll along the cliffs, he had a nice catnap with his mother, then a bath and a little playtime. Then a long, leisurely nursing, and back to sleep. Vanni had a shower, put on a lightweight sundress, primped and waited until she heard a soft tapping at the door that separated her from Cameron. \u201cIs he asleep?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d</p><p>Cameron crept near the portable crib and looked at him. He saw Vanessa\u2019s shawl on the bed and picked it up, draping it over her bare shoulders. \u201cI was prepared for him to join us for dinner.\u201d He laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep an ear turned his way. Come here,\u201d he said, taking her hand. \u201cI have drinks on the patio.\u201d He led her through his room onto his patio where a table had been set with china. He lifted a drink and put it into her hand. The sun was just beginning its downward path. He touched her glass with his. \u201cTo a weekend away from it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Cameron. I didn\u2019t realize how much I needed something like this.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a chair for her, turning it slightly to face the beautiful sunset. \u201cSit down and enjoy the sunset. Are you warm enough?\u201d</p><p>She pulled the wrap around her and nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss the flying, Vanni?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI miss the girlfriends,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in touch and we visit a lot, but there were four of us who bid our schedules together, so every trip was like a four-day pajama party. Two of us lived in L.A., two in San Francisco. We\u2019re still close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you go back to flying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that part of my life is over. I can\u2019t imagine leaving little Matt for days at a time. Half of my problem is not having any idea what\u2019s coming next for me. Sitting in my father\u2019s house, a single mother?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that....\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cVanni, you\u2019re not going to do that. Carol said something about you joining her in real estate....\u201d</p><p>It was her turn to laugh. She felt an overwhelming temptation to tell Cameron she\u2019d rather have all her teeth pulled than work with Carol every day, but knowing their friendship preceded hers with him, she just said, \u201cNo. I already told her I wasn\u2019t interested in real estate, but in her usual fashion she wasn\u2019t listening and is probably getting a desk ready for me at her brokerage firm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA formidable woman,\u201d he said, giving his head a shake. \u201cBeing her daughter-in-law probably has its challenges, but I have to hand it to her\u2014she got me my house at an irresistible price. She got the seller to bring the price way down without me even making an offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably wore them down. She\u2019s worn me down a time or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only imagine.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock at the door and Cameron rose to admit a man dressed in waiter livery carrying a large tray. He was a friendly man in his fifties, delighted to be serving them. He chatted about the food as he prepared their plates, poured them wine and large glasses of water. He had a van backed right up to Cameron\u2019s hotel-room door and went back and forth to bring in the meal and, once their plates had been served, he stood silent by the hotel-room door, allowing them to talk and enjoy the meal, watching in case it was time to refill water or wine glasses.</p><p>They were served salad, pasta, chicken Marsala, crisp green beans with almonds, Chardonnay. Then came cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis must have cost a fortune,\u201d she whispered across the table to him.</p><p>\u201cIt was worth every penny,\u201d Cameron said, taking a last bite of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \u201cThe hotel manager hooked me up with a local restaurant and I talked to the chef. He recommended the menu, said he\u2019d have it sent over and served, and I thought it made so much more sense to be here where we could hear the baby than trying to go to a good restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd subjecting the other diners to a crying baby?\u201d She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re all very grateful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCrying babies are pretty much a part of daily life for me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd for me,\u201d she added. \u201cThis was so thoughtful. I can\u2019t think of another thing you could have done to create a perfect getaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019ve enjoyed it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmensely. And on top of it all, you\u2019ve been a real Boy Scout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had my instructions,\u201d he said with a chuckle. The waiter returned to the table and offered them coffee. \u201cI\u2019m not a nursing mother,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not driving\u2014I\u2019m having another drink. How about you, Vanni? What would you like?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDecaf?\u201d she asked. And it was provided. The dishes were cleared away, a carafe of decaf left on the table. Cameron sipped his drink slowly and then the door softly clicked closed for the last time, leaving them alone.</p><p>Leaving them to talk. And talk. They went over families, friends, places they\u2019d lived, terrible apartments they\u2019d rented, bad cars they\u2019d purchased, trips they\u2019d taken. They laughed and asked each other questions and became friends, something Vanni had said she wanted. But when she said it she was only trying to keep him from pursuing her romantically. She was a bit surprised to realize how much she liked him and hoped he could be her friend.</p><p>She glanced at her watch; over three hours had passed. The day had been nearly perfect. It had taken her mind off all sorts of things, and had proven an ideal escape with a wonderful gentleman. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time for little Matt to make himself heard,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDoes he still wake in the night?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cA couple of times, but he eats and goes back to sleep. People keep telling me he\u2019s an easy baby. Thank God. It\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s been easy lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t draw the fussy card. You just never know.\u201d</p> <p>She pushed her chair back and stood. \u201cI\u2019m going to turn in. I know it\u2019s still early for you, but after Mattie\u2019s next meal, I\u2019ll go to bed.\u201d</p><p>He stood, as well. \u201cI\u2019m right here if you need anything.\u201d And then he walked her to their adjoining door.</p><p>She turned and faced him. \u201cReally, I don\u2019t know how to thank you. The day was wonderful, the evening was perfect. And you\u2019re exceptionally well behaved.\u201d She grinned at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me too much credit. It\u2019s all part of a devious plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. If I can show you a good time, make you feel safe and comfortable, then maybe when you\u2019re ready, I\u2019ll have a chance.\u201d He smiled at her.</p><p>She tilted her head and looked at him with a sweet smile and glowing eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely wonderful.\u201d</p><p>He shied a bit at the compliment and dropped his gaze, laughing softly. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve never had an interest in a widow with a baby before and I\u2019m finding it has its difficult points.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>He threaded a hand under her hair and around her neck. \u201cOh, yeah. For one thing, you just smell so damn good. If your situation was different, you might have to beat me off with a club. I have a giant crush on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have done this,\u201d she said, but she didn\u2019t pull away from his hand. \u201cI\u2019d hate to lead you on....\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, it\u2019s not your fault if I have a crush and a desperate need to try to impress you. Don\u2019t you have enough baggage without taking on mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m impressed,\u201d she said softly. She leaned toward him and put a gentle kiss on his cheek. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to let you down.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes locked and for a moment they were suspended there. And then he slowly pulled her toward him. He was going to kiss her and she was going to let him. But then the baby started to snuffle in the crib and whimper. She pulled back with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s my call,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThank you for a lovely day. And for being such a dear man, for understanding so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, removing his hand. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want it any other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Cameron.\u201d</p><p>Of course Vanni couldn\u2019t sleep. It stung. She wanted hands on her. She wanted a man\u2019s hot and eager body pressing her down in the bed, filling her, making her tremble and cry out. She hadn\u2019t been touched, or physically loved in so long. After Matt\u2019s death, after the baby, when her body began to come back to life, there was only one man whose touch could tempt her, really tempt her. Matt\u2019s best friend. Her best friend.</p><p>Oh, it made her so furious, tears came to her eyes. That damn Paul! He wasn\u2019t nearly as smooth, as romantic as Cameron! He wasn\u2019t as pretty, and Lord knew, he didn\u2019t want her like Cameron did.</p><p>Then she remembered the way he laid his head on her shoulder and wept right after the baby was born, the way he slipped his arms around her waist when she cried at Matt\u2019s grave, the way he held her and the baby close for a few long moments before saying goodbye...And the tears came. How had she let this happen? Why can\u2019t I just want the man who wants me\u2014instead of the man who has no room in his life for me?</p><p>Sometime in the dark of night, Cameron was awakened by odd, faint sounds. He opened his eyes and listened. The baby, he thought. He sat up. But that wasn\u2019t a baby crying, he realized. He got out of bed and crept closer to the door that separated him from Vanni. She was weeping. Crying soft, muffled, sad tears.</p><p>He pushed gently on the door and it opened\u2014she hadn\u2019t locked it. Maybe she did trust him, he thought. He pulled on his pants and went to her room. \u201cVanessa,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She moved in her bed. She sniffed. \u201cCameron?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNothing, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>He went to her bed and sat on the edge. He looked down at eyes that, even in the darkness of her room, were filled and overflowing, her nose pink. \u201cGod, Vanessa, if I made you cry, I\u2019ll hate myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You\u2019re completely innocent. You\u2019ve been wonderful. I think too much sometimes. I have to learn to let some things go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey,\u201d he said, pulling her close. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. These things take time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry. I knew\u2014we both knew\u2014you\u2019ve had so much to deal with, to try to put into perspective. It\u2019s okay.\u201d He crawled onto the bed and, on top of the coverlet, slipped an arm under her head to hold her. \u201cYou take your time, Vanni. There\u2019s lots of time.\u201d</p><p>She turned in his arms and cried against his bare chest, and he held her, understanding the pain. He ached for her. The woman had buried the husband of her heart right before delivering his child. Moving on to the next part of her life wasn\u2019t going to be that easy.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care. He was willing to go through this with her, because this was exactly the kind of woman he wanted in his life. A woman who could show commitment this powerful, emotion this deep, love this enduring.</p><p>When he woke hours later, still on her bed, he saw her across the room, her nightgown slipped down to nurse her baby. As she looked down at her son while she fed him, a tear glistened on her cheek. She was having trouble leaving her spouse behind, and every time she looked at her son it would serve as a reminder.</p><p>It was not the morning after he had imagined or hoped for. He went to his room to shower. Then he had a nice breakfast delivered to the room, but he excused the waiter so they could be alone. He held the baby against him as Vanni picked at her food and sipped her coffee. \u201cAre you feeling any better?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cA little bit,\u201d she said. \u201cGod, Cameron. You don\u2019t deserve this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I understand. But I think we should go home. I think maybe you could use some time alone. I don\u2019t think being with me right now is helping much.\u201d</p><p>She reached across the table to touch his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think it wasn\u2019t a wonderful weekend. For a while there, I really was far away. I needed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt came with a little pain. That\u2019s the last thing I wanted for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m the one who should have known better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to believe it\u2019ll just keep getting easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d she said. But she didn\u2019t say it with much confidence.</p><p>The ride back from the coast was pretty quiet in Cameron\u2019s car. He attempted conversation a few times, but Vanni didn\u2019t have much to say. They had to pull into a rest stop for a while for Vanni to nurse and change the baby, so he walked around outside, giving her privacy. He stayed close, feeling protective. He reached across the console to hold her hand a few times as they drove, and she squeezed his hand affectionately, but she smiled at him with regret and sadness in her eyes and it filled him with a foreboding. He had wanted their weekend together to be just the beginning, but he had a feeling it was going the other way.</p><p>It was about two in the afternoon when they came up to the general\u2019s house. Cameron stopped short of the drive. Parked outside the circular driveway in a nice neat row were the general\u2019s SUV, Tommy\u2019s little truck, Paul\u2019s big truck.</p><p>Vanessa stared at the vehicles, gazing out the window, her mouth set in a serious line. Waiting on the front stoop was Paul. He stood as Cameron\u2019s car came into view and Vanessa\u2019s eyes were locked on him. He had something in his hand, like a pebble or sliver of wood that he tossed. He hooked his thumbs in the pockets of his jeans and looked anxiously at Vanessa. \u201cDamn,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cI\u2019m such an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa turned to look at Cameron. She lifted her chin. There it was, in her eyes. All of it.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your husband\u2019s memory that made you cry,\u201d he said, suddenly understanding so much more than he wanted to. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she said, tears threatening to fill her eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? What\u2019s that?\u201d he asked, indicating Paul.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea why he\u2019s here. He has someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love him.\u201d</p><p>She gave a hiccup of emotion. \u201cI\u2019m just very confused. We were so close. Matt, the baby, everything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa,\u201d he said sincerely. \u201cYou were never honest about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to be honest about! I\u2019m trying to move on. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cAll right, don\u2019t cry. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I didn\u2019t want to mislead you,\u201d she said, but then she lifted her chin, sniffed back her tears and said, \u201cI mean nothing to him. We\u2019re just good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s obviously not true.\u201d He glanced at Paul, who was waiting for them to stop talking and pull up. \u201cHe\u2019s here. He\u2019s waiting for me to bring you back. You might\u2019ve told me you had feelings for him. I\u2019ve been straight with you. You know I\u2019d like to get something started between us. You should have been clear\u2014you\u2019re not available.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCameron, please, I tried to warn you about expectations. Please, don\u2019t make this worse. I don\u2019t want you to think I just used you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly didn\u2019t do that. You could have. I would have welcomed that, but no\u2014you weren\u2019t ready. Now I understand why.\u201d He laughed without humor. \u201cGod, I\u2019ve made a classic fool of myself.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. I\u2019m going to check back with you later\u2014much later. See where you are. Maybe you\u2019ll be free. Maybe not. But I\u2019m out of this triangle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he said. \u201cI could handle what I thought I was up against. I didn\u2019t know you were in love with someone else.\u201d He took his foot off the brake and coasted forward. When he stopped in front of Paul, he jumped out, went to the passenger side of the SUV and opened the door for Vanni. He then went into the back, pulled out her small suitcase and the stroller, taking them to Paul. \u201cHey, buddy,\u201d he said. \u201cMake yourself useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Paul said, taking them to the front door.</p><p>Cameron got Mattie out of the car seat and before passing him to Vanessa, took a long slow moment to put a little kiss on his head. Then as he passed the baby to Vanni, he placed a soft kiss on her lips. Against them he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t work out better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your good boy,\u201d Cameron said, passing the baby.</p> <p>\u201cI had a lovely time,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThank you for everything.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t resist. He touched her hair, gazed into her eyes. Out of Paul\u2019s earshot he said, \u201cI hope I get a chance to show you I\u2019m a better deal. I can be there for you through all this crap. I\u2019d never let you down, never leave you to wonder how I felt. Never.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cI hope the son of a bitch disappoints you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed hollowly. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d She held her son against her chest and put her palm against his cheek. \u201cThank you for being so understanding. You\u2019ve been very decent.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my original idea.\u201d He became serious. \u201cYou know my number, in case you\u2019re ever ready to move on. I mean, really move on.\u201d</p><p>Paul stood near the front door with Vanessa\u2019s suitcase in one hand and the stroller in the other, watching as they said goodbye. It was sheer torture. The soft kiss, the whispers, the hand against his face. It was all so sweet, so tender. Oh God, he thought. I\u2019ve lost her forever. Again.</p><p>When Cameron got back in his car and drove away, Vanessa walked briskly up to the front door. Paul stood there wearing a hangdog look and rather than making her long for him, it set her on edge. Everything in her life would be different right now if he\u2019d leveled with her from the start, if he\u2019d made himself clear\u2014he was committed elsewhere and she was merely a good friend. He opened the door for her and she walked right past him. \u201cHello, Paul. Have a nice weekend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot so much. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can be so important?\u201d she asked, breezing through the foyer. \u201cHi, Dad,\u201d she called as she passed by him en route to her bedroom. Paul followed her with her luggage and the stroller.</p><p>\u201cIf you could just give me a few minutes. I\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you shouldn\u2019t have waited,\u201d she said, laying little Matt in the crib, busying herself with his diaper. \u201cYou could have just as easily returned my calls. Or maybe made a few calls of your own.\u201d She looked at him and said, \u201cYou keep saying we have things to talk about, then I don\u2019t hear from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I have to talk about. I want to explain. Vanni, please.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and saw that he was miserable and she didn\u2019t care. She hoped he was in agony. \u201cAll right. Go ahead.\u201d</p> <p>He looked nervously over both shoulders. \u201cCan we go someplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cBecause it\u2019s tremendously personal. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to close the door?\u201d she asked, lifting one mocking eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t like to close the door!\u201d He took a breath. Don\u2019t get mad at her, he told himself. She was just acting on instinct. Just trying to have a life after all that death. He couldn\u2019t get mad about that. He of all people. \u201cMaybe we could go for a ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m just back from a long ride. Let me change the baby. Then if you want to, we can walk outside. Will that do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019ll have to,\u201d he said in a definite pout. And then he slowly got sucked into touching the baby\u2019s head, smiling into his face and making him smile back. The diaper came off and Mattie sent up a stream of urine that appeared four feet high, which Paul ducked and Vanessa covered quickly, making them both laugh. \u201cAll right,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just take a walk outside. Is he good? Not hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been fed,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll just put him in his bouncy seat out by Dad, if it\u2019s okay with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d He backed away a little, slipping his fingers into his back pockets. He had to keep doing that because he wanted to touch her so much, and this would be a bad, bad time. The look on her face indicated she was maybe inches from wanting to belt him.</p><p>A little while later, the baby settled in his seat beside Walt\u2019s chair, Vanessa and Paul walked out on the deck behind the house and down the stairs toward the stable. \u201cIs this something you\u2019d like to share with Matt?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr is this just for me?\u201d</p><p>He sighed in frustration. \u201cJust for you,\u201d he said miserably. He tried to grab her hand, but she pulled it away. \u201cListen, I\u2019m not sure you know how I feel about you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do. You\u2019ve made it clear. You have a situation in Grants Pass, a woman, and you\u2019re not in touch much. It\u2019s obvious how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Because...\u201d He stopped walking. She stopped walking. \u201cI care about you a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. I appreciate all your concern. You\u2019ve been very good to me and Mattie. You\u2019ve been a very good friend to Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not just about Matt. I thought we were close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we are,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cLike brother and sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, I have some things to explain....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you keep saying. Think you\u2019ll get it out this time?\u201d</p><p>He ground his teeth in frustration. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason I\u2019ve been hanging back a little bit. Why I\u2019ve been so distracted. I wanted to wait until I figured some things out, until I knew it wasn\u2019t too soon after Matt for you...but it\u2019s starting to look like I might already be too late.\u201d</p><p>They got as far as the corral and she leaned her back against the fence, her elbows on the top rail, heel on the bottom rail, facing him.</p><p>\u201cCan I start at the beginning? Will you listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means, take your time,\u201d she invited with a wave of her hand.</p><p>\u201cWay before you came to Virgin River, way before I ran into you at Jack\u2019s, long before anything happened to Matt, I was seeing this woman sometimes....\u201d</p><p>She averted her eyes in spite of herself. They\u2019d gotten this far before\u2014he\u2019d found a woman. Still, it just wasn\u2019t easy hearing that he had a woman in his life, though it was completely reasonable.</p><p>\u201cI met her a long time ago. We had one night together,\u201d he said. He shrugged. \u201cNot even a whole night. I called her a couple more times because...Because,\u201d he finished. \u201cIt was casual. Not my finest hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did something wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAt the time, I sure didn\u2019t think so. Vanni, I slept with her a few times, all right? We had an understanding. You know how it is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, as a matter of fact. I\u2019ve actually never had that kind of understanding. But you men\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on! You probably had more sex over the weekend than I had last year!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d she asked, lifting her chin defiantly. In fact, at that precise moment, Vanni regretted that she couldn\u2019t allow herself to do that. Men seemed to be able to do it so easily\u2014make love when there isn\u2019t love, see it for what it was.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even care,\u201d he said in frustration. \u201cThat\u2019s not even the point. What I have to explain is not that I had sex last year, when you were married, pregnant and my best friend was alive, but that I had sex a couple of months ago. After I went home, after the baby, I was pretty screwed up. Losing Matt was killing me, I didn\u2019t want to leave you, staying with you was eating me alive, and...\u201d</p><p>He looked down, took a breath and continued, \u201cI tried blowing off some steam with my brothers and the construction crews. But where I made my fatal mistake was I called this woman who I never had anything with but sex and asked if we could talk. Have dinner and talk. I was messed up, Vanni. I needed to tell someone what it was like, burying my best friend, helping his baby get born. I was in a lot of pain, guilty, needy. I shouldn\u2019t have called her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it wasn\u2019t just talk....\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course not,\u201d he said. \u201cShe tells me she\u2019s pregnant. From that.\u201d</p><p>She felt that icy-cold wave of dread pass through her gut. Just when she thought it couldn\u2019t get worse. \u201cWell, my God,\u201d she said in a breath.</p><p>\u201cAt least I finally have your attention,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t kidding when I said it was important. And personal.\u201d</p><p>She pushed herself off the fence. Anger shook her inside, but she tried to keep her expression passive. \u201cYou have some issues. Tell me, Paul\u2014what does a woman have to do to get that much of you?\u201d</p><p>He hung his head and shook it. \u201cYou won\u2019t be impressed,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was seductive, available, I didn\u2019t care...I\u2019m not proud of that. And I apologized, but my apology isn\u2019t going to change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ll be getting married I suppose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t. When I left here last week and told you I\u2019d call\u2014I got home to this hysterical message from her and I went to her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you had to....It\u2019s not as though there are consequences now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, I didn\u2019t sleep with her. I\u2019ll never sleep with her again. I went to make sure she didn\u2019t do anything to herself, to the baby. I went to talk her down. That\u2019s what tied me up\u2014the reason I didn\u2019t call. This woman and I\u2014we don\u2019t have anything together except this. I didn\u2019t even talk to her last year from October to February. But if she is having a baby and if it is my baby, I have to take care of her. Them. I have to. You understand that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf?\u201d Vanni asked.</p><p>\u201cShe said she was on the pill. I wore a condom. Seems like there\u2019s still an outside chance this could be a mistake. Probably not, but who knows? It\u2019s early. I wanted to wait until I knew for sure before...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you men just can\u2019t keep it in your pants, can you?\u201d she said in disgust.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can damn sure believe it\u2019s behind locked doors now! You think I didn\u2019t learn an important lesson there? Now I want you to tell me something, Vanni. You and the doctor? Is that a done deal? Do you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that it\u2019s your business, Paul,\u201d she said indignantly. \u201cHe cares for me very much.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you? You care for him very much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference? You\u2019re having a baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it sort of looks that way. But I\u2019m not having a wife. I\u2019m not having a girlfriend or a lover.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis baby will be your priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t little Mattie? Because, Vanni, if you make a baby, whether you meant to or not, you raise a child. That\u2019s how it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis woman, Paul. She must want you to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to marry her, Vanessa\u2014that would be cruel. She deserves a husband who loves her, not a man who\u2019s in love with another woman.\u201d</p><p>She frowned slightly. Her mouth stood open. He took a step toward her and she took a step back. The fence of the corral came up against her back. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere I\u2019ve been treating you with these kid gloves,\u201d he said. \u201cAfraid you couldn\u2019t be approached because of your grief, afraid I\u2019d spoil my chances with you by moving too fast. And it turns out I wasn\u2019t fast enough. But, Vanni, everything I saw told me you weren\u2019t ready\u2014being annoyed with Carol for her fix-up, crying at the grave...\u201d He took another step toward her and she looked up, way up, into his warm brown eyes. He lowered his face closer to hers, gripping her chin in his thumb and forefinger, lifting her chin. When he spoke, she could feel his breath. \u201cVanessa, I\u2019ve been in love with you forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was I supposed to know that?\u201d she asked in a shocked whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to know it.\u201d His other hand was on her waist, his lips close to hers. \u201cYou were married to my best friend\u2014you know I\u2019d never hurt Matt like that. Never. It would have been a betrayal for you to even guess how I felt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat first night, I pointed you out to Matt. You were so beautiful, so full of life and energy, I couldn\u2019t even get up the nerve to talk to you. I\u2019ve never really loved a woman before. I haven\u2019t since, and I tried. I tried. I wanted to be over you because I could never have you. I should have told you how I felt before I left right after the baby was born. But I was afraid you\u2019d be...I don\u2019t know. Shocked. Horrified. That you would think the worst of me, loving my best friend\u2019s wife, that you\u2019d never trust me again. I was afraid you\u2019d hate me. And then the general would shoot me.\u201d</p><p>A tear escaped and ran down her cheek. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re going to be a father,\u201d she said in a breath.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that seems to be the case. And if I\u2019m going to be a father, I\u2019ll be the best one I know how to be.\u201d He wiped the tear away. \u201cI\u2019d love to be a father to Mattie, too. You know I love him. Vanni, you have to believe me\u2014I never wanted anything bad to happen to Matt. He was my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, there\u2019s a woman in Grants Pass who\u2019s counting on you! She needs you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know if you can understand this, but it was only sex. It wasn\u2019t even my idea, the sex. It was just\u2014God,\u201d he said, backing away a little bit, hanging his head. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can for her, but we\u2019re not going to be a couple. Send him away, Vanni. Send the doctor away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m involved with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t Matt we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to bow out quietly. I\u2019ll do whatever I have to do. I\u2019ll fight for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if we made love all weekend? Me and Cameron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care about anything but that you have to know the truth. I\u2019m in love with you. I\u2019ve always been in love with you\u2014and being in love with my best friend\u2019s wife was torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I asked you to walk away from that situation in Grants Pass if you want a chance with me? What if I said I couldn\u2019t deal with that?\u201d</p> <p>He hung his head. \u201cVanessa, you know I can\u2019t. I\u2019d never abandon a child like that. If there\u2019s a price to pay, I\u2019ll pay it\u2014but not an innocent child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t happening,\u201d she said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI love you. I think you must have feelings for me or you wouldn\u2019t be so angry. There\u2019s at least one child between us, maybe two. What we have to do is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni!\u201d</p><p>They jumped apart at the sound of Walt\u2019s voice yelling from the deck. Just the tone of her father\u2019s shout sent a chill up her spine. She pushed Paul out of her way, thinking something might\u2019ve happened to the baby. She ran across the yard and up the small hill to the deck, Paul close on her heels. But Walt stayed on the deck and if anything had been wrong with the baby, he\u2019d have been inside. When Vanessa got up to her father he said, \u201cIt\u2019s Aunt Midge. She passed. We have to go. You\u2019ll have to pack up the baby again. Tom\u2019s getting his things together then he can help you.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Walt turned and went back into the house.</p><p>Vanni was frozen for a moment. She shot a look at Paul and he reached for her hand.</p><p>\u201cVanni, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>She just shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do, Paul, except go quickly so we can get on the road...\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, tell me you understand what I told you. I can\u2019t leave anything in doubt now.\u201d</p><p>She looked down for a moment. Then she raised her eyes and locked into his. \u201cPaul, listen to me. There\u2019s a woman in Grants Pass who\u2019s having your baby. I want you to go home. Go home to her. Try, Paul. If there was something about her that appealed to you enough to make a baby with her, maybe you can make a life with her....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Vanni, that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry, Paul. Try to fall in love with your child\u2019s mother. If you don\u2019t at least try, you\u2019ll regret it for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. You didn\u2019t hear what I said...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy aunt just died and I have to go,\u201d she said. \u201cDo what you have to do, Paul.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>W alt was sixty-two, but his only sibling, his sister Midge, was all of forty-four. She\u2019d gotten pregnant at eighteen, had a six-month marriage to the father of her child and then lived her entire adult life as a single mother with her daughter. Shelby had just barely turned twenty-five. When Shelby was still in high school Midge had been diagnosed with ALS, Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. It had been Shelby and Midge all along, so it was no surprise that Shelby ended up as a caregiver when the disease progressed.</p><p>For the first couple of years of Midge\u2019s illness, Shelby was able to either go to school or work part-time in addition to helping her mother, but it wasn\u2019t long before Midge was a full-time job. The disease had been in its final stages for a couple of years, and while Midge had been ready to go, Shelby hung on. She\u2019d told her uncle Walt many times she couldn\u2019t say goodbye to her mother unless she believed she\u2019d done everything she could to make every day count.</p><p>The tragedy or blessing of Lou Gehrig\u2019s is that the body withers and fails while the mind remains alert and functional\u2014Shelby and Midge chose to see this as a great blessing, for their time together had rich, sentimental moments. Midge had gone into a wheelchair four years ago, finally into a hospital bed two years ago, and soon after she was completely paralyzed. Shelby got a little help from her uncle who visited almost every week once he had retired. There was a home-nursing service, and then hospice.</p><p>They were in Bodega Bay and Walt had been prepared to move there after his retirement from the Army, but it was Midge who urged him to look further. She knew she wouldn\u2019t last long and she didn\u2019t want her brother to establish a retirement home based on her location. In fact, Walt had retired less than a year before her death and even that had been longer than any of them had predicted for Midge.</p><p>The drive from Virgin River to Bodega Bay was about four hours. Tom was dozing in the backseat of the SUV with the baby while Vanni sat up front with Walt. They\u2019d made many such visits\u2014most often Walt went alone, sometimes with Tom, sometimes with a pregnant Vanni\u2014but now they were all going to say a final goodbye. Mike Valenzuela had offered to take care of the horses for them while they were gone.</p><p>Vanni said nothing as they drove, but stared out the window.</p><p>\u201cI never even had a chance to ask you how your getaway with the doctor went,\u201d Walt said. \u201cWith Paul waiting so apprehensively for the same reason, and all...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just thinking, I never got down there with the baby to see her\u2014and I should have made that trip the first one. Before Carol and Lance. Midge was on borrowed time....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kick yourself about that,\u201d Walt said. \u201cThe household of an invalid is complicated. We talked about it\u2014it would\u2019ve been hard on Midge and Mattie, not to mention Shelby. Midge understood, believe me. And Matt\u2019s parents had a priority there. They lost their son\u2014it was good that we went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstead of going to Mendocino, I should have gone to Bodega,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cVanni, Midge would rather you have had a nice weekend\u2014she was at peace with her destiny. That\u2019s the one thing that gives me comfort. She was ready. She wasn\u2019t holding out for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby will need help now, won\u2019t she?\u201d Vanni asked.</p><p>\u201cShelby has her own ideas. We\u2019ve been over this many times. She wants to sit tight for a while, continue with her ALS support group and get her bearings. Caregivers have huge adjustments after the end\u2014she wants to figure things out before she makes a big change. I think that\u2019s smart. After all, she was only a young girl when this all started, she hasn\u2019t had an adult life at all, at least not the usual kind. The house is hers now, and she\u2019ll either sell it or keep it, but it needs a lot of work and I\u2019ll help with that. At twenty-five, it\u2019s finally time for her to start her life.\u201d Then he took a deep breath. \u201cMidge wasn\u2019t in pain. Emotional pain, yes\u2014she felt she was a burden. My little Midge\u2014she didn\u2019t have it easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, are you okay?\u201d Vanni asked.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m relieved. She was leaving us so slowly. At last she has her reward. At last...she can walk and laugh again...\u201d</p><p>Shelby had been born in the small house that had been her widowed grandmother\u2019s and she had lived there all her life. Her father had never showed his face during her entire childhood and there were no support payments of any kind\u2014but her uncle Walt had always been there for them. When her grandmother died, Walt refused any of the insurance benefit and took over the house payments. In addition to that, since Shelby had no male role model in her life, she spent summers with her uncle\u2019s family where she learned to ride, shoot skeet, and had what passed for siblings with her cousins, even during Walt\u2019s Army tours abroad. Shelby had lived summers in Germany and Denmark with the Booths. Because of the Booth family, Shelby\u2019s childhood had been rich with family.</p><p>The life of a caregiver is a hard one, emotionally draining and physically exhausting. Shelby couldn\u2019t have done otherwise\u2014her mother was her best friend. So when the Lou Gehrig\u2019s began to get bad, although Shelby was very young, her life went on hold to care for her. But hers was not a lonely life by any means\u2014the support system for families with life-limited members was a strong one. They helped each other in every possible way and formed incredibly strong friendships. The evidence of this was obvious at Midge\u2019s memorial\u2014nearly a hundred people turned out for a woman who hadn\u2019t left her bed in over two years. They were clearly there for Shelby.</p><p>Midge had been cremated. She had not wanted to take that wasted body into eternity. The house had become run-down during her illness and neither an open house nor a reception was possible; the living room had held the hospital bed and support equipment needed for her care, all of which had been quickly swept away within a day of her passing. Midge\u2019s wishes had been spelled out very clearly\u2014no fuss, just kind words and friendship\u2014but Walt and Shelby had made arrangements with a funeral parlor months preceding her departure and secured a room that was bright and spacious, and refreshments were catered in. There were a few tasteful arrangements of flowers and one large, gorgeous spray sent by Paul Haggerty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Walt and his family arrived Sunday night and by Wednesday all the farewells had been said to Midge. He wanted Shelby to pack up and come home to Virgin River with them, but she wouldn\u2019t. \u201cI have things to do,\u201d she said. \u201cImportant things. Not only does this house need a lot of work\u2014most of which I can do myself\u2014but I have a big transition to make. I\u2019m staying with my support group until I\u2019ve had a chance to adjust to the change. And,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to leave Bodega Bay. I\u2019ve been here all my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to do now?\u201d Vanni asked her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of the transition,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. People in my group have talked about trying to make changes too fast\u2014it can be devastating. I\u2019m not going to let myself fall into that trap.\u201d</p> <p>So Walt went about the business of helping Shelby make a list of repairs and renovations that should be done to make the house presentable again. It was paid off now, so Shelby could do with it as she pleased. Shelby\u2019s list contained mostly cosmetic items from cleaning and painting, to tearing out old window coverings to replace with new ones. Walt\u2019s list was a little more industrial\u2014he thought it was time for new doors and frames, windows and baseboards, not to mention new plumbing fixtures and updated appliances. After all, this had been his mother\u2019s home. He felt a responsibility to it, he always had. He would personally contract most of this work to be done for Shelby.</p><p>Shelby herself needed some remodeling. Even though her caregiving job had been very physical, she hadn\u2019t been getting the right kind of exercise and had gained weight. Her complexion was pale and blemished, and she hadn\u2019t bothered with makeup in years. Her hair had grown long\u2014she\u2019d never had it cut\u2014and she wound a single honey-colored braid around her head to keep it out of the way. Shelby had plans for some personal changes, but she didn\u2019t discuss any of that with her family because she wasn\u2019t sure where to begin. And she wasn\u2019t sure it was even possible.</p><p>The Booths left on Friday to make the drive back to Virgin River, though leaving Shelby was hard. But she was adamant\u2014she needed the time to grieve, to be alone, to figure out how to have a life that wasn\u2019t consumed by a loved one\u2019s illness.</p><p>They were about halfway home, Tom nodding off beside the baby in the backseat while Vanni sat up front, staring out the window. \u201cIt was a sad week in many ways,\u201d Walt said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also the end of a sad time. I\u2019d worry more about Shelby being on her own if she hadn\u2019t shouldered so much responsibility by herself for the past few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has many wonderful friends,\u201d Vanni added.</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right, Vanni?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHmm, just a little melancholy, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s bothering you most\u2014Midge\u2019s passing or some problem you\u2019re having with Paul.\u201d She turned to look at him and he said, \u201cAnything you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s not too much to talk about, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could help me understand a couple of things, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor instance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be coy\u2014you stood Paul up to go away with the doctor and if I know anything about you, you\u2019re not that interested in the doctor. Hell, you\u2019ve been in a strange mood since Paul left after Mattie was born. You knew Paul was coming for the weekend\u2014and despite his best efforts to be circumspect, you knew he was coming for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t so sure about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you fight with him, Vanni. Did you and Paul have some kind of falling-out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Walt took a breath. \u201cVanessa, I don\u2019t mean to pry, but it\u2019s pretty apparent to me how you feel about Paul. And how Paul feels about you. And yet...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, while Paul was here last autumn, we got a lot closer. We were good friends before, but of course with all we went through together...Dad, before all that happened, Paul had a life in Grants Pass. One that\u2019s not so easily left behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, Paul loves you, but something happened between you recently...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe let me know\u2014there are complications in Grants Pass. Something he\u2019s been struggling with. It\u2019s kept him from being honest about his feelings,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has commitments, Dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA woman?\u201d Walt asked.</p><p>Vanni laughed softly. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be so surprised that Paul actually had women in his life, should we? Yes, apparently there was a woman. Is a woman...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Walt said under his breath. \u201cHe\u2019s not married, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. He wouldn\u2019t keep something like that from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEngaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says there\u2019s enough of an entanglement there to make his position difficult. That\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t around after Mattie was born.\u201d</p><p>Walt drove in silence for a while and Vanni resumed gazing out the window. After a few moments of silence Walt asked, \u201cWhat about you, Vanni? I know you care about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, Matt\u2019s only been gone a few months. Should I even have such feelings? Should I be completely embarrassed? I\u2019ll miss him forever, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do that to yourself, honey,\u201d he said. \u201cHaven\u2019t we learned by now? Life is too short to suffer needlessly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill people say I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a good goddamn what people say,\u201d he growled. \u201cEveryone is entitled to a little happiness, wherever that is. And I think for you, it\u2019s with Paul.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and said, \u201cI\u2019m asking myself why I thought I had some claim on him. He was very good to us all, I\u2019m so grateful\u2014but why didn\u2019t I realize that a man like Paul wouldn\u2019t have any trouble attracting the attention\u2014the love\u2014of a woman? I\u2019ve been so angry with him for not telling me, but...Why didn\u2019t I ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what, Vanni? Is he trying to make a choice, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were having a discussion, not a very pleasant one, right when the call came from Shelby. It left his intentions up in the air a bit. But there\u2019s one thing I won\u2019t do, I can\u2019t do\u2014I can\u2019t ask Paul to choose me over a woman he has an obligation to. I tried to make it very clear, his duty to me as his best friend\u2019s widow has expired. He doesn\u2019t have to take care of me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling it\u2019s more than duty,\u201d Walt said. \u201cI have a feeling it always has been...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has to do the right thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not getting in the way of that. A man like Paul\u2014he could regret the wrong decision for the rest of his life. And frankly, I don\u2019t want to be the one left to live with his regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boy. You two have some talking to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Paul has business to take care of. I have nothing more to say about this.\u201d</p><p>Paul arrived in Virgin River about midafternoon on Saturday. He left his duffel in the truck, allowing for the possibility he wasn\u2019t welcome at the Booths\u2019. He hadn\u2019t talked to Vanni since the Sunday before\u2014she\u2019d been busy with the family in Bodega Bay. Besides, the conversation they needed to have wasn\u2019t for the telephone. But the way things had ended between them caused him to hit a wall. He couldn\u2019t let her get away again, or he\u2019d never be the same. She could push him back, be angry about his screwup, but he was going to keep coming at her until he had her attention. She was going to have to tell him, convincingly, that she didn\u2019t love him, and didn\u2019t want him in her life. That was the only way he\u2019d let go. And he was done tiptoeing around the issue.</p><p>He was greatly relieved to note the doctor\u2019s car was not parked outside the general\u2019s house. Tom opened the door for him. \u201cIs Vanni here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just went for a ride. She\u2019ll be back in about an hour. Two at the outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind if I wait around?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Tom said. \u201cYou look all stirred up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need to talk to her, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Good luck with that. She hasn\u2019t been in a real talkative mood. Coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>So, they knew, he thought. No surprise there\u2014she was all worked up and angry when they parted a week ago. And she was close to her brother and father; she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to talk with them about her problems. Their problems.</p><p>As he moved toward the kitchen, he saw the general out on the deck leaning on the railing, looking out at his view. The other thing Paul dreaded was facing Walt before he faced Vanni. But he wasn\u2019t going to blow it this time; he\u2019d lay it out there and face it like a man. Then he was going to beg Vanni to forgive him. It could take time, but he\u2019d gladly wait her out.</p><p>He took his coffee out to the deck and, as he stepped onto the planks, Walt turned.</p><p>\u201cYou did show up here. I predicted you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m fearless, sir,\u201d he said. Then he swallowed nervously.</p><p>\u201cYou must be. She\u2019s really got her back up this time. Vanni\u2019s down at the stable, but I\u2019d like a word with you before you go after her, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>I mind, Paul thought. Do I have a choice? \u201cCertainly,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ll forgive a man a lot of things, but toying with my daughter\u2019s feelings, hurting her after all she\u2019s been through, that\u2019s a tough one. That would be hard, even though we owe you for all you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I\u2019m not toying with her, I\u2019ll make it up to her somehow. I just wasn\u2019t thinking real clear after we buried Matt, and after little Matt was born. My judgment wasn\u2019t keen. I\u2019m afraid I made a mess of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t say much about that\u2014I don\u2019t know that anyone\u2019s judgment was as good as it could have been. It\u2019s been a painful, difficult year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for saying that, sir. I appreciate it. I guess you could be a lot less understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now my only concern is Vanessa. Mind if I ask what your intentions are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, sir. You have every right, under the circumstances. I\u2019m in love with your daughter....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat couldn\u2019t escape my notice,\u201d Walt said, leaning his elbows back on the railing. \u201cYet it doesn\u2019t appear the two of you are on the same page there.\u201d</p><p>With that full head of silver hair, tanned skin and bushy black eyebrows, Walt could look downright menacing. Paul gulped. \u201cShe mentioned the situation in Grants Pass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did. She has some concerns about you doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll do the right thing\u2014there\u2019s no reason to worry about that. I tried to explain, the relationship wasn\u2019t serious. I\u2019m not very proud of that, sir. I didn\u2019t see the woman very often\u2014a few times in a year, that\u2019s all. But it is what it is\u2014I can\u2019t deny I was involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d Walt asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, sir, even if Vanessa tells me I don\u2019t stand a chance in hell, I\u2019m still not inclined go any further with the other woman. It just wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>Walt frowned. \u201cMaybe Vanessa misunderstood you,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought there was some kind of commitment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, sir. I\u2019ll take care of her and my child. I\u2019ll support them and it\u2019s my intention to be an involved father. But as for the mother\u2014I hope for her sake she can find a man who\u2019s right for her, a man who isn\u2019t in love with another woman. Regardless of that, I plan to help raise my child. It\u2019s the only way. It\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Walt was speechless for a moment. Finally, in a stunned breath he said, \u201cMy God, you have a complicated life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurreal. Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when were you planning to drop this little bomb?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrankly, sir, I wanted to wait until I was sure of a couple of things before I admitted to what an idiot I am. I don\u2019t know the woman a tenth as well as I know Vanni and I have to be sure there really is a child, that it\u2019s my child, that sort of thing. Since I did what I could to protect her from pregnancy, there leaves a little doubt\u2014but I can\u2019t deny the possibility. And\u2014I wanted to be sure Vanni knew I feel as committed to little Matt as my own child. If she\u2019ll have me with all these complications, that is.\u201d</p><p>Walt crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cSounds like you\u2019ll have women and children all over the place. That could be an expensive proposition. Spreading yourself a little thin, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney isn\u2019t going to be the biggest problem. I have a successful company, a supportive family. Shared custody, a situation that wouldn\u2019t appeal to any man, that\u2019ll be tough. But I\u2019m not going to ignore my responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI give you credit for that,\u201d Walt said wearily, shaking his head. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ll verify all this quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m going to the next doctor\u2019s appointment and then...I just want to be sensitive. The woman is understandably upset and I don\u2019t want to suggest she\u2019s lying, but we have to be sure. Too many people are going to be hurt by my actions as it is. Once the facts are indisputable, I just hope Vanni can forgive me. Accept me with my baggage...\u201d</p> <p>Walt looked over his shoulder at a sound and both men watched as Vanni opened the corral gate, mounted Chico and rode away from the ranch, down along the riverbank. \u201cWell, she\u2019s getting away from you. If you have a case to plead and don\u2019t want to do it in front of her father and brother, I guess you\u2019ll have to go after her.\u201d</p><p>Paul put his still-full cup of coffee on the patio table. \u201cCan I borrow a horse, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock yourself out,\u201d the general said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d he said, clambering down the deck stairs and taking off for the stable.</p><p>Walt watched him run. Then he shook his head and said, \u201cHoly Jesus.\u201d</p><p>Paul saddled up Liberty, the general\u2019s stallion, the feistiest horse in the stable, but also the fastest. It took a while to get him ready, though he hurried. He\u2019d been on this horse once before and remembered him to be difficult, hard to handle. Tom, the more experienced rider, didn\u2019t mind taking Liberty and leaving Chico for Paul. But today Paul wanted to catch up with Vanni and he really hoped Liberty didn\u2019t throw him and break his stupid neck before he found her.</p> <p>He took the stallion at a fast trot along the riverbank for a good twenty minutes before he saw her up ahead. He urged the horse a little faster and when he was within her hearing, he whistled. The piercing sound cut through the air and Vanni turned her mount toward him. She took one look at him, turned and kicked Chico\u2019s flank, taking off.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit!\u201d he swore. So, this was how it would be\u2014not easy. He was going to have to take off the gloves. He risked being thrown by giving Liberty a snap with the end of his rein. The stallion reared. Paul hung on, then leaned low in the saddle while Liberty closed the space between them. By God, he was going to catch her, make her listen, get through to her. There was no one within shouting distance to distract them. For once in his life, he was going to finish! Even if he had to cover Vanessa\u2019s mouth with his hand!</p><p>It only took him a few minutes to catch up to her, thanks to Liberty, the champion of the stable. Pulling alongside Vanni he reached out over her hands and grabbed her reins, pulling Chico to a stop. The expression she turned on him was fierce.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cListen to me!\u201d he retorted.</p><p>\u201cMake it quick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Here\u2019s quick. I love you. I\u2019ve always loved you. I loved you before Matt saw you, but I didn\u2019t have his guts and I hung back. I\u2019ve regretted that forever. Now I have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA baby coming,\u201d she interrupted, lifting her chin.</p> <p>\u201cListen! I don\u2019t know much about being a father! Just what I watched when I was growing up! And you know what I saw? I saw my parents with their arms around each other all the time! I saw them look at each other with all kinds of emotions\u2014love and trust and commitment and\u2014Vanni, here\u2019s the ugly truth\u2014if I made a baby, I\u2019m not angry about that. It wasn\u2019t on purpose, but I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019ll do my damn best, and I\u2019m real sorry that I\u2019m not in love with the baby\u2019s mother. I\u2019ll still take care of them\u2014and not just by writing a check. I\u2019ll be involved\u2014take care of the child like a real father, support the mother the best I can. What that child is not going to see is his parents looking at each other like they\u2019ve made a terrible mistake. I want him to see his dad with his arms around his wife and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you try?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you give the woman who\u2019s got your baby in her a chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want for her? She\u2019s a decent person, Vanessa\u2014she didn\u2019t get pregnant on purpose. You want her stuck with a man who\u2019s got another woman on his mind? I didn\u2019t want this to happen to her\u2014I\u2019m not sticking her with half a husband! She deserves a chance to find someone who can give her the real thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she loves you. She does, doesn\u2019t she? She wanted to get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa, she\u2019s scared and alone. It\u2019s what comes to mind. She\u2019ll be all right when she realizes I\u2019m not going to let her down. And I\u2019m not going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this because you couldn\u2019t open your mouth and say how you felt, what you wanted,\u201d she said hotly. \u201cI wanted so little from you\u2014just a word or gesture\u2014some hint that you had feelings for me. Instead, you took your wounded little heart to another woman and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped her tirade as she saw his eyes narrow and his frown deepen. He glared at her for a long moment, then he jumped off the stallion, her mount\u2019s reins still in his hands. He led the horses the short distance to the river\u2019s edge, to a bank of trees.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, hanging on to the pommel.</p><p>He secured the horses at a fallen tree, then reached up to her, grabbed her around the waist and pulled her none too gently out of the saddle. He whirled her around and pressed her up against a tree, holding her wrists over her head and pinioning her there with the whole length of his body. His face was close to hers. \u201cYou never opened your mouth, either,\u201d he said.</p><p>She was stunned speechless. She couldn\u2019t remember a time Paul had ever behaved like this\u2014aggressive, commanding.</p><p>He leaned closer. \u201cOpen it now,\u201d he demanded of her just before he covered her mouth with his. Her lips opened under his and he moved over her mouth with passion, with heat, and she responded with her own. Her gentle, shy Paul, not only filled with all this desire, but clearly aroused. He let go of her wrists and circled her waist to pull her harder against him, and with a sigh and a shiver of lust, her arms went around him, yielding. Not just yielding\u2014inviting.</p><p>Feeling her response, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to end the kiss, but only deepened it, invading her velvety mouth with his tongue, letting his breath out slowly as her tongue came into his mouth. It was with a great deal of regret that he reminded himself they had to talk it through, get all their issues in the light and dealt with. But when he left her mouth, he stayed so close to her, he was whispering into her parted lips. \u201cVanessa, you have the worst goddamn temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re the bossiest woman I\u2019ve ever known. I want you to listen to me\u2014I can\u2019t change what I feel, what I\u2019ve felt for years. I tried, because I never thought I\u2019d have any kind of chance, I never imagined that we\u2019d lose Matt. And even with you in my arms, finally, I\u2019d give anything to have him back. But we can\u2019t, Vanni. It\u2019s going to be you and me now. That\u2019s all it can be. Now stop all this fucking around\u2014because I want you so bad, my head is pounding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never knew how you felt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Vanni,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved Matt, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And he loved you.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cAnd I loved you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were the guy who caught my eye the night we all met. You. Yet you never even talked to me. Maybe if you\u2019d talked to me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe beat me to it. And once that happens...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she do, Paul? The woman in Grants Pass? How\u2019d she manage to get your attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. She was pretty. Seductive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was lonely. I let it happen, Vanni, because there was no reason for me not to. You belonged to someone else. Not just anyone else, but Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd later? When I didn\u2019t belong to anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you still belonged to Matt, to a memory,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was pretty much out of my mind. It was stupid. I told you\u2014I\u2019m not good with women. I never have been, or you\u2019d have belonged to me, not my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any regrets, you know. Matt was good for me, good to me. He made me happy, he gave me a beautiful son. I\u2019ll never regret a day...\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni,\u201d he whispered, brushing that thick, copper hair away from her face. \u201cVanni, as much as I love you, as much as I wish I\u2019d had the guts to pursue you before he got to you, in the end I wanted you happy. I wanted him happy. But now...\u201d He gave her a kiss. \u201cIt is what it is. I want us to go forward. I want to take care of you and Mattie. And probably one more...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still not certain?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cVanni, be prepared\u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019m getting out of that one. If I\u2019m responsible for a child, I\u2019ll see it through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She sighed. \u201cCould be a large family in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stand by me through that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019d stand by little Matt, wouldn\u2019t you? That\u2019s how it is. We don\u2019t leave babies out there alone, without parents who love them.\u201d</p><p>He smiled into her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re wonderful, you know. But very hard to shut up.\u201d He pressed himself against her, kissing her deeply. \u201cGod,\u201d he said in a whisper, going after her again, so desperately she laughed against his lips. \u201cDo you have any idea how long I\u2019ve wanted to kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re telling me the truth, I know exactly how long. Paul, I want you to know something\u2014while I was Matt\u2019s wife, I didn\u2019t have one second of doubt or temptation. Not one split second. I loved him completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, I know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until later, after the baby, months after Matt was gone...And I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever see me as anything more than your friend\u2019s wife...I used to talk to Matt about you. I\u2019d stand out at that grave and tell him that I\u2019d always love him, but I was going to love again and, if he approved, he should give you a nudge. You were so much more than a friend, but you didn\u2019t seem to see me as a woman. I thought you couldn\u2019t separate me from your best friend and his death.\u201d</p><p>He ran his hand down her hair. \u201cOh, I saw you as a woman\u2014too much woman for me. I was fighting for my life, I was so guilty about the way I\u2019d felt for years. I didn\u2019t know what to do except give you time, watch you come out of mourning and plan my approach. And trust me, I wasn\u2019t planning this one.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThe goddamn doctor got there ahead of me. The fact that you were a recent widow sure didn\u2019t slow him down.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDoes she know about me?\u201d Vanni asked.</p><p>\u201cShe does,\u201d he said. \u201cGod, I hope she and I can work together on this. Most of all, I hope you\u2019re not making a big sacrifice because of my screwup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let a child of yours go any more than you could.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVanni, I want to marry you, take care of you and Mattie.\u201d</p><p>She frowned slightly. \u201cWait a minute\u2014is there anything else you should tell me before you propose? Any other little secret stuffed in the back of your closet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonest to God, that\u2019s it. Until very recently, I had the most boring life in Grants Pass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about that? Because until last week, I thought I knew everything about you. I mean, I\u2019ve known you for years, lived with you for months. We spent so many hours just talking...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Jesus, isn\u2019t that enough? I want to marry you and Mattie. In fact, once we get the lay of the land, I\u2019d like to have more children. Maybe at least one that we actually make together. I\u2019d give anything for that, Vanni.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s see how many you have so far before we make those kinds of plans, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll marry me?\u201d he asked, brushing the hair away from her brow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very interesting guy, Paul. It takes you years to tell me you love me, and minutes to ask me to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait till you\u2019re ready, but I want us to be together forever.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth lifted along with one reddish brow, teasing. \u201cDon\u2019t you think we should see how we work out sexually? See if we\u2019re good together?\u201d she asked, grinning playfully.</p><p>\u201cVanessa, we\u2019ll be good together. Well, you\u2019ll be perfect and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll catch on eventually.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cAre you going to say yes or make me beg?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think I want to live with my father and have a weekend boyfriend forever? Yes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, thank you,\u201d he said, grabbing her to him again. \u201cIs tomorrow too soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little bit. We\u2019re waiting on the Grants Pass baby, remember? It won\u2019t make a difference, but I think we should know how many people we\u2019re bringing into this family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do that. Right away. That\u2019s perfectly reasonable,\u201d he said, grinning. Then he shook his head in sheer wonder. \u201cYou\u2019ve been wonderful about this. I didn\u2019t really expect you to come around so quickly. I thought you were going to drive me crazy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve turned it over in my mind for a while now. When it happened, we didn\u2019t know where we stood with each other. It\u2019s not as if we said the I love you\u2019s and you went to bed with another woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you insisted I try to see if I could love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to be sure. I don\u2019t want another woman\u2019s man, even if it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re remarkable, you know that? In fact, your whole family is remarkable. Your dad was pretty civil about it, too.\u201d</p> <p>She was quiet for a moment, a startled look on her face. \u201cMy dad?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He just wanted to be sure I wasn\u2019t playing with your feelings. And he seemed kind of interested in how I was going to manage, financially. I told him the company\u2019s doing well, that\u2019s not going to be a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told my dad?\u201d she asked, cutting him off.</p><p>Paul was frozen, staring at her for a second. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally said. \u201cYou told your dad. Because he asked me if I planned on...Oh shit, what did he ask me? Something about whether I had commitments in Grants\u2014\u201d He leaned over her shoulder and let his forehead bang against the tree. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Absolutely, sir\u2014I\u2019ll support the woman and my child.\u2019 Oh God.\u201d</p><p>Vanni, laughing, pushed him away slightly. \u201cYou told my dad!\u201d she exclaimed, laughter shaking her.</p><p>Paul grimaced. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said, her eyes alight and her smile huge. \u201cThat\u2019s a little personal, don\u2019t you think? Plus, you said you still had to be sure it was for real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d told him. What did you tell him?\u201d</p><p>She looped her arms around his neck, but she was laughing too hard to speak for a while. \u201cI told him we shouldn\u2019t be surprised to learn you\u2019d actually had women in your life before you came to Virgin River. That there was a woman...\u201d And she dissolved into laughter again.</p><p>He leaned against her once more, pressing her back to the tree. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? It\u2019s hilarious!\u201d She laughed a little more and finally said, \u201cPaul, he\u2019s a trained interrogator. You walked right into it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see the humor...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t have a sense of humor, I don\u2019t know if I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>She was cut off by his mouth finding hers. In fact, he kept her from laughing for a long time, covering her with his body. They kissed and held on to each other. Finally he released her lips and asked, \u201cYou done laughing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I think you worked it out of me.\u201d</p><p>He touched her swollen lips with tender fingers. \u201cDo you think your father will shoot me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cBut if you hear a rifle cock, you might want to duck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d he said, kissing her again.</p><p>\u201cI think I have whisker burn,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He grinned. \u201cLooks good on you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go back. I have a baby to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back....He\u2019s going to be waiting for me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well just face it,\u201d she said, and laughed again. \u201cWe\u2019ve been out here a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite long enough,\u201d he said, and kept her just a few more minutes, afraid to let her go.</p><p>She wiggled her hips against his. \u201cPaul, it\u2019s pretty obvious, pinning me against a big old tree turns you on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I need that, too. Probably more than you do. And the sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>Vanni left Paul to tend to the horses while she rushed back to the house to check on the baby. It took him the better part of an hour to get them brushed down and stabled, the tack put away. He might\u2019ve been dragging his feet a little when he went back to the house. By the time he got there, Walt was standing at the dining-room buffet fixing himself a short drink. Paul had lived with the man for months; even given the untimely death of his son-in-law, he hadn\u2019t been a daytime drinker. If tragedy or depression didn\u2019t drive him to the bottle, this had to be celebratory.</p><p>Walt turned, regarded Paul and lifted one bushy black eyebrow. \u201cFix you a little something to take the edge off, son?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d And mentally he added, \u201cYou dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBourbon? Scotch? Canadian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrown?\u201d Paul answered in question.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d Walt said, selecting the bottle from the cabinet and pouring a short shot on ice. He passed it to Paul and said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t do much undercover work in the Marine Corps, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d He raised his glass. \u201cHere\u2019s to me winning the game I didn\u2019t even know I was playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you,\u201d Paul said grudgingly.</p><p>After having a sip, Walt said, \u201cI know you pretty well, Paul. Before today, I never had a doubt about you. So, I\u2019ll only ask once\u2014you plan to treat my daughter well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike solid gold, sir. Despite everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re her choice, that\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d And he raised the glass again.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut really,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cYou walked right into it.\u201d</p><p>Vanni and her father were so alike it was scary. In addition, she had a fiery temper. And he asked himself, Do I want a general for a wife? The answer came quickly. Oh, yes. Oh my God, yes.</p><p>Eight</p><p>T he general, knowing things had been resolved and were now heating up between Vanni and Paul, made himself scarce after dinner, leaving the reconciled lovebirds to the kitchen cleanup alone. But Tom didn\u2019t have the facts and caught them in a serious lip-lock while they were supposed to be washing and drying dishes. Paul had Vanni pressed up against the sink, devouring her with yet another passionate kiss.</p><p>To Paul\u2019s back, Tom said, \u201cI guess this means you two have things worked out?\u201d</p><p>Paul whispered in Vanni\u2019s ear, \u201cGet rid of him, will you? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away, Tom,\u201d she said a little breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cAbout time, Paul. Really, I was beginning to think you were a little slow or something. I\u2019m going to Brenda\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo curfew tonight,\u201d Paul said, though his voice was muffled against Vanni\u2019s neck. \u201cStay away all night if you want.\u201d</p><p>There was the sound of laughter, then the closing of the front door, and Paul\u2019s lips were on Vanni\u2019s again.</p><p>\u201cVanni, honey,\u201d Paul whispered. \u201cWill you pack a bag for yourself and Mattie and come away with me in the morning? Come back to Oregon with me for a few days....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave very early,\u201d he said. \u201cLike in an hour...\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave at nine. I don\u2019t want to rush the baby....\u201d She gave him a little kiss, then wiggled away from him, putting away the last plate. \u201cI have to go give Mattie his bath, then get him settled for the night.\u201d</p><p>Paul spent what seemed to be an interminable two and a half hours in front of CNN, unable to concentrate on a word of it. After an hour he got up and fixed himself a drink, asking the general if he could get him anything. But the general declined\u2014probably because he didn\u2019t have what was best described as bridegroom nerves. Paul was asking himself a hundred questions.</p><p>He had no idea if he was a good lover. How does a man know? He\u2019d been pretty successful at getting the job done, satisfying the woman he was with before thinking of himself. He couldn\u2019t remember any complaints, but he wasn\u2019t a man who\u2019d been with a lot of women. Not by comparison to some of his friends, for sure. And never with a woman like Vanni. And with Vanni, he didn\u2019t want to merely satisfy her\u2014he wanted to bond her to him forever with the greatest pleasure of her life. He wanted their coming together to be sweet for her. Sweet and powerful. Paul wanted her to know he could be an adequate husband.</p><p>He heard the baby crying, then making sweet little noises while he enjoyed his bath. A while later he heard the tub fill again; Vanni was treating herself to a soak.</p><p>Would she cry over Matt when they finally made love? Would she remember him, long for him, miss him all over again? And how does a man handle that? Paul asked himself. He wished he\u2019d thought to ask Jack; Jack had married a widow. There must have been special challenges. I\u2019ve held her through a million tears, Paul thought. I can hold her through as many more as it takes.</p><p>He took a shower, mostly to distract himself, and when he came out of the bathroom only one light was left on in the great room, probably for Tom. There was a light under the general\u2019s door and the sound of the TV in his room could be heard.</p><p>Paul stepped out onto the deck and stood under a cool, dark sky that was riddled with a million stars. The sky was so deep and clear, it was as if one could see into the next universe. He was barefoot and bare chested with his towel slung around his neck. He looked toward Matt\u2019s grave, then toward the sky, holding on to the ends of the towel. I swear, he promised, I\u2019ll do my best, buddy. I\u2019ll do my best by both of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d give the world to hear Matt snap back some smartass response.</p><p>Paul went to his room, dug around in his shaving kit, then went to Vanni\u2019s bedroom door. He quietly turned the knob until it opened a crack. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she whispered back, sitting up in her bed and flicking on the lamp. \u201cAre you completely crazy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuicidal,\u201d he said. He entered her room, softly closing the door behind him. The first thing he did was glance at the baby to make sure he was asleep. \u201cI have to spend more time with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith my father right down the hall? With me in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if the whole Army is down the hall. If you won\u2019t come away with me tonight, I just couldn\u2019t stop myself. Are you naked?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes and grinned at him. She was wearing a gray T-shirt with ARMY printed on it. Yet on her, it sure looked sexy. And God, that grin\u2014it was everything. It was his world. She was so strong, so sure of herself. He should have known she was ready for him, for them, or she\u2019d have told him she wasn\u2019t, because that was Vanessa. She didn\u2019t play around, didn\u2019t make mistakes with her feelings. She knew where she was headed; she had a will as powerful as the general\u2019s.</p><p>He grinned back at her. \u201cYou should try to be quiet,\u201d he said. And she giggled. \u201cVanessa! For once in your life...can you be quiet this once?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Paul. What are you going to do to me?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and knew his eyes grew hot. \u201cI\u2019m going to get under that Army T-shirt. Unless you ask me not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I want you under the T-shirt. But really, this is way more bold than you usually are...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m turning over a new leaf. No more waiting for an invitation. No more waiting for just the right moment. I need you. God, do I need you.\u201d His mouth covered hers, his hands slipped under the T-shirt, finding her breasts, and he groaned. \u201cAw, Vanni. Your bottom half is totally naked.\u201d</p><p>She grinned against his lips. \u201cYours isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying really hard to talk sense into myself,\u201d he whispered against her lips.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll break down the door and shoot you in the back of the head,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s much more direct. And he hates dealing with me when I\u2019m depressed. But you might want to listen for that rifle cock...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried like hell not to do this,\u201d he said, lifting her T-shirt, his lips finding her nipples. \u201cTurn that light off....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you take off your jeans,\u201d she said.</p><p>He raised his head. \u201cYou\u2019re crazier than I am,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAre you going to be quiet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try. Really. But if he comes knocking?\u201d</p><p>Paul gave her an evil grin. \u201cAnyone who touches that door is really going to have his hands full.\u201d He tossed the towel that had been around his neck over the back of a chair in her room. Before unsnapping his jeans, he pulled some condoms out of his pocket and put them on the night side table. There were several.</p><p>She glanced at them and lifted one tawny brow. \u201cThat\u2019s very optimistic, Paul,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably delusional,\u201d he answered, pulling the T-shirt over her head and tossing it away. His breath caught at the sight of her; she was breathtaking. And not the least shy. Then he stood, his hands went to the snap and zipper and he shed his jeans quickly, kicking them away.</p> <p>Her eyes grew round. \u201cOh my. Dear God.\u201d He was simply beautiful. A soft mat of brown hair covered his chest, his hips were narrow, legs long, and he was huge. Huge and erect.</p><p>He sat down on the bed and his expression took on an earnest look. \u201cAre you all right since the baby? Are you worried about having sex?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were glued to his male parts. \u201cI\u2019m a little more worried about being quiet,\u201d she said thoughtfully.</p><p>Paul turned off the light, claimed her lips and slipped down into the bed with her. His hands were all over her, caressing her back, her breasts, her firm, round bottom, her lush hips. And her hands were on him immediately, examining every part of him with her fingers and palms, stroking, rubbing. \u201cI want you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI want you so bad.\u201d And his fingers slipped down to that damp place where her legs were joined. \u201cOpen for me, baby.\u201d He didn\u2019t have to ask twice; her legs came apart. He slipped a finger through her silky, slick softness and inside. He whispered against her parted lips, \u201cOh man, that didn\u2019t take long....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cYou came out of your jeans ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, I\u2019ve been ready for hours. I tried a shower, a walk outside, a drink...\u201d</p><p>She reached over to the bedside table for a condom, began taking it out of the foil, but she didn\u2019t quite get the job done. His fingers on her, in her, his mouth on her neck and breast, it was almost more than she could take. She began to tremble and grabbed his wrist to pull his hand away. \u201cStop,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m already too close. Wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cNo waiting. Let go,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Come for me. Hard and fast.\u201d And he kept touching her, stroking her, moving against her while he kissed her.</p><p>She spiraled up and over the top instantly, climaxing before she could even help with the condom. It was crunched in her clenched fist and she made a rather loud, growling moan and Paul covered her mouth as fast as he could, trying to muffle the sound under his lips, but he didn\u2019t let her fall alone\u2014he carried on with his rough caresses, taking her beyond pleasure. He continued until the storm was past and she collapsed, breathless beneath him, soft in his arms. The only fear he\u2019d had was that for some reason he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it for her\u2014but he hadn\u2019t even gotten started and she was gone. Off like a rocket. It thrilled him.</p><p>\u201cAw, baby,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was special. You do that very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d she answered, weak. \u201cI meant to wait for you....\u201d</p><p>He took the package out of her hand and applied the condom. \u201cI should have known. You\u2019re a fireball. Let\u2019s have some more of that, huh? Let me in, baby. We\u2019re not done.\u201d</p><p>With a passionate sigh, she lifted her knees and he worked his way inside, slowly, easily, until she took all of him. \u201cPaul,\u201d she whispered, clutching him. \u201cPaul...\u201d</p><p>He rose above her and began to move, slowly, evenly, deeply. He had to cover her mouth with his because the sounds she made would give them away. He grinned down at her. \u201cYou\u2019re a screamer, aren\u2019t you, sweetheart?\u201d He moved some more and his voice was hoarse, strained. \u201cDo it again, Vanni. Give it up.\u201d Then he covered her mouth again and pumped and she went out of her mind, over the moon, beyond the stars\u2014and an explosion of pulsing pleasure that left her totally limp and completely spent. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl. You are very good at that....I am the luckiest man alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul,\u201d she whispered weakly. \u201cI can\u2019t keep doing that without you. What are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>He pecked at her lips and she could feel his smile, she could feel his teeth. \u201cJust once more, sweetheart, come on. It\u2019s so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, exhausted. \u201cI just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see....\u201d He slipped down, kissing and licking his way down past her breast, over her tummy and, pulling her thighs apart, gave her a few hearty strokes with his tongue, right in her center. She threw her head back and moaned loudly. Paul\u2019s hand came up to cover her mouth firmly, which only made her squirm more wildly. He didn\u2019t torture her long. He rose, entered her again and shifted his hips slightly, creating a perfect friction. In the darkness of the room, he could see her eyes were wide, her lips apart slightly as she gasped in anticipation. \u201cOne more,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOne more, for us.\u201d She arched her pelvis against him, digging her heels into the mattress, and again he had to cover her gasping mouth to quiet her. \u201cI love you, baby,\u201d he whispered against her parted lips. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d And then she exploded, drowning him in pulsing heat.</p><p>Paul was done holding back. He\u2019d never had a feeling like this before. He let it go with a powerful blast and believed in his heart he was making Vanessa his till the end of time\u2014his woman, the head of his family, the love of his life. And he was hers. He released himself at her exact moment and emptied himself into her, giving her his heart, his life, his soul.</p><p>And then he held her, soft against him, stroking her hair and pressing soft kisses into her temple. \u201cI\u2019ve never had an experience like that in my life,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re an amazing woman. I think I might be the luckiest man in the world, to have this with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShew,\u201d she whispered, letting out her breath. \u201cI think you\u2019re catching on....\u201d</p><p>She was answered by a deep, low chuckle. \u201cYou make it so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Paul,\u201d she said, laughing softly. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know\u2014you\u2019re an incredible lover. And I know there have been women...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very many,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are things about this that are brand-new.\u201d He rose up on an elbow and looked down at her. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever made love with someone I want to spend the rest of my life with, someone I want to be my partner, my best friend, my lover until the end. The mother of our children. It\u2019s what\u2019s been missing from my life.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a long moment; her eyes might\u2019ve glistened. \u201cThat\u2019s very sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very true.\u201d He gave her a kiss on the cheek, chin, lips. \u201cShould I get out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Stay with me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, baby. As long as you want me here,\u201d he whispered back.</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d she said. \u201cIs forever too long?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek and pulled her against him. \u201cMight not be long enough...Give me a second in the bathroom. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the towel and wrapped it around his waist. He was lucky; no traffic in the hall. He made it a quick, quiet trip and was back in bed beside Vanessa, pulling her close. Paul lay awake for a long time, just listening to her breathe, drinking in her scent. Holding her like this, naked against him, it was like a miracle. You don\u2019t just go to sleep on miracles. You savor them, give thanks for them.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Paul looked out Vanni\u2019s bedroom window at dawn and caught sight of the general trudging down to the stable to feed the horses that he finally made the short journey back to his own bedroom.</p><p>Vanessa was in the kitchen in the morning with a cup of coffee, Mattie in his bouncy chair on the table beside her, when Walt came back from the stable. \u201cGood morning, Daddy,\u201d she said brightly. She looked at her watch. \u201cYou must have had a very early start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the regular time,\u201d he said, going for a mug of coffee. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss the hell out of Tom. I\u2019m just starting to realize what it must have been like for him, up so early, getting all that stable work out of the way before school.\u201d He took a sip. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss more than that, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t have it any other way,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all so proud of Tom. He\u2019s going to do well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the hard part\u2014sending him off like this, knowing it\u2019s the best thing, even while it feels like the worst thing. And I\u2019m losing you, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>Vanessa had no trouble imagining how the general could look scary as hell to his troops. But this morning, at the kitchen table with just his daughter and grandson, he was soft as a puppy. She reached across the table and patted his hand. He played with the baby\u2019s foot with his other. \u201cYou\u2019re not losing me, Daddy. Not ever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Vanni. You\u2019re a young woman in your prime. Paul\u2019s a fine young man, despite the fact that he\u2019s fathering the nation...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, he\u2019s a good man. His incident aside.\u201d</p> <p>She leaned toward him. \u201cYou\u2019re not losing me,\u201d she said again. \u201cBut I packed a bag this morning. I\u2019m going home with him, Dad. Just for a few days. We\u2019ll be back before the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me a bit. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t take off in the dark of night.\u201d</p><p>Then she asked softly, \u201cDid I disturb your sleep last night?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI suppose we\u2019re an odd family,\u201d he said. \u201cNot quite the stiff and upright family I had always thought we were, but the facts of our lives have changed all that. Relaxed our expectations...At least mine.\u201d He looked down. \u201cI heard you, yes. It wasn\u2019t too disturbing. In fact, those are happy sounds.\u201d He lifted his eyes. \u201cThere were other nights I heard you\u2014and your brother. Nights of crying over loved ones lost. Your mother. Your husband. And I don\u2019t doubt there were nights young Tom, at only fourteen, wondered what to do about a tough old three-star crying in his bed over his wife\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVanni\u2014life is rough. It can\u2019t help but be, especially for military families like ours. But we have to soldier on, be strong, do the best we can. If you tell me you\u2019re happy with Paul...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dad, I love him so much. I loved him before I fell in love with him, if that makes sense. He loves me. And\u2014he loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny man who would do all he did after his best friend\u2019s death\u2014this is a man who deserves my respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Daddy. We still have plenty of time before Tom\u2019s graduation and his exit to basic training, even if I spend a little time in Grants Pass.\u201d She laughed. \u201cTom may have trouble fitting us in, anyway\u2014I know Brenda is on high priority right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaving is hard for him, too. But he\u2019ll be swept up in it in no time. There\u2019s something about being with those boys, competing, trying to prove yourself. He won\u2019t have time to miss anyone.\u201d He laughed a little. \u201cThe girl. He\u2019ll miss the girl. He\u2019s not a eunuch, after all.\u201d</p><p>She smiled but didn\u2019t say anything. Her father\u2014he\u2019d looked at so many young faces over his career\u2014his read was solid.</p> <p>\u201cPaul\u2019s hoping to do some building here. We\u2019ll live down here as much as work provides.\u201d</p><p>Walt\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cDid you insist on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cHe loves this place. He has good friends here. He loves coming to meet the boys. He\u2019d like to build us a house here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni,\u201d he said, touched. \u201cThat would be wonderful. I can let you go if it\u2019s what you want but, selfishly, I\u2019d be so happy to have you nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have details to work out. And there\u2019s that other matter\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before she could continue, Paul walked into the kitchen. \u201cGood morning, sir,\u201d he said, heading to the coffeepot.</p><p>Walt stood. \u201cVanni tells me you\u2019re considering working here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. But don\u2019t get ahead of me\u2014I have to talk to the family. When we get up to Oregon for a few days, Vanni can do some grandparent time with Carol and Lance, meet my family, and I can run this proposition by my dad and brothers. I hope you\u2019re okay about me taking Vanni home with me for a few days. We\u2019ll be back before the weekend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s good.\u201d Walt stuck out his hand to Paul. \u201cYou should go away together for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I can get some sleep.\u201d And then he walked out of the kitchen.</p><p>Paul could feel subtle changes in himself after just twenty-four hours. A confrontation with Vanessa followed by one night in her arms had taught him a few things about her. And himself. She was a strong woman\u2014she needed a man of equal or greater strength. One who was sturdy, determined, not someone who would defer or shy away. She liked power, and she didn\u2019t crave it for herself, but rather wanted to align herself with it; she was a formidable partner and required a man who wasn\u2019t the least bit nervous about that. If Vanessa felt overpowered, she wouldn\u2019t cower, she\u2019d fight. But if she felt considerably stronger than her man, she\u2019d fight even harder. She could only team up with confidence, passion and conviction. All that brought out the best in him\u2014his self-assurance and competence. She was raised by a general\u2014she appreciated brawn and nerve. Courage.</p><p>She liked his gentle side, but only in contrast. She\u2019d been forced to shoulder so much pain and loss and had had to be tough; she couldn\u2019t partner with a man who would take her strength for granted; she needed a man she could lean on sometimes. She had a temper; she was feisty and bossy, sometimes difficult. But she was fair and just with a love that was deep and enduring. She had both a growl and a purr; Paul was committed to bringing out and adoring both.</p><p>She was perfect for him. And he realized with some surprise that he was her match. It was an incomparable feeling. The pride it fed in him honed his strength, deepened his love.</p><p>While Paul drove them to his home, to Oregon, with the baby tucked into his car seat in the back of the extended cab truck, Vanni slept as much as Mattie did. The trepidation that had kept him from speaking up earlier, that had once kept him from approaching her from across a crowded bar and sitting down beside her a few years ago, was gone. He was possessive, sure of himself, serene. He couldn\u2019t keep his hands off her, constantly reaching for her, touching her knee, circling her shoulders with his arm. He\u2019d been inside her body, made her tremble with pleasure and beg for more, branded her, made her his. She didn\u2019t scare him anymore.</p><p>When they were nearly to Grants Pass, Vanni asked when they should see Paul\u2019s family or the Rutledges. \u201cWe\u2019re not even going to call them until tomorrow afternoon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop off at the grocery, get what we need and have a night alone, just the three of us. Monday is soon enough to get in touch with them.\u201d When Vanni started making noises of cooking him an elaborate dinner to show off some of her skills, he stopped her. \u201cWe\u2019re not spending all our time in the kitchen tonight. There\u2019s plenty of time for that,\u201d he said. Into the cart went diapers, formula for the baby, cereal, eggs, milk, sandwich and salad makings and an already-roasted chicken and vegetables.</p><p>Vanessa had seen some of Paul\u2019s work before\u2014Mel and Jack\u2019s house, which was Joe\u2019s design and Paul\u2019s construction expertise. But he showed her his house in Grants Pass with pride. It was a masterpiece. Large oak double doors led into a spacious foyer with white marble floors. There were a few steps down into a sunken great room with thick, light beige carpet and a large fireplace of beautiful slate. A long row of windows with French panes looked out onto a manicured lawn, and the ceilings were high and beamed. There were two bedrooms, spacious, and throughout the house were stunning built-in bookcases and cabinets and even a gorgeous built-in breakfront in the dining room, so large it took up most of one wall. Off the kitchen and dining room was a long deck with a barbecue and redwood furniture. Paul had done most of the interior work himself\u2014he had a complete workshop in the third bay of his three-car garage; he was a master carpenter. The kitchen was a showplace\u2014hardwood floors, white granite countertops flecked with gold, cupboards with glass doors. And it was immaculate to the point of being sterile.</p><p>\u201cThis is magnificent,\u201d she said in a breath. \u201cI would give anything for such a house,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll build you whatever you want,\u201d he said.</p><p>Paul set up the baby\u2019s port-a-crib in the second bedroom while Vanni nursed him in the great room. He made a tray of snacks, poured Vanni a glass of wine and himself a beer. Then there was a little playtime before Mattie started to yawn. Paul took the baby to his bed to put him down for a nap and when he got back, he found Vanni in the kitchen, rinsing off their dishes.</p><p>He wanted to tell her things about how his life had changed in a day, but the words eluded him. It would be nice to explain that he\u2019d been with women before, but never like this. He\u2019d had sex. Good sex. In fact, the worst sex he\u2019d ever had was pretty damn good. But no woman before her had taken him in with the kind of intimacy and intensity that Vanni had; he was sure he\u2019d never been able to draw the kind of response from anyone that Vanessa had given back to him. The second his lips touched her neck or his hand glided over her soft body, she was in motion. Hotter than fire. The passion she unleashed was unbelievable. Unimaginable. The way her hips moved against him, it made him weak to even think about it. It gave him a kind of power and mastery he didn\u2019t know he had. When she was in his arms he became the world\u2019s greatest lover. There was nothing in the universe that could stroke a man\u2019s pride more than lighting up a woman with such ease; to bring her complete, exhausting satisfaction like that, over and over. She was amazing and he felt as if his heart would explode. And clearly, the most remarkable and wondrous part was that she left him without a shred of doubt\u2014she was his. Completely his.</p><p>But instead of trying to explain how she made him feel, he came up behind her, put his arms around her and kissed her neck. He shut off the running water and turned her around. He lifted her into his arms and whispered against her parted lips, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I can take you to my bed and love every piece of you.\u201d</p><p>She trembled and answered, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re not getting me there faster.\u201d</p><p>And then it began again...</p><p>Muriel St. Claire figured Sunday afternoon was a good time to check out the town of Virgin River. Everything was very quiet and she knew she could poke around without creating a huge stir. The house she\u2019d recently bought was just outside of town and she\u2019d never had time to do more than drive down the main street. The place was small and compact with what looked to be one very low-key restaurant and no other businesses on the main street.</p><p>The Open sign was on in the window of the restaurant, so she parked her truck and went inside. Muriel looked around appreciatively. This was a perfect little country bar and grill\u2014everything polished to a high sheen, embers glittering in the hearth, two little old ladies sharing a table near the fire, fishing and hunting trophies on the walls. Behind the bar was a good-looking, grinning bartender polishing glasses.</p><p>She felt a little overdressed in her tailored pants, ostrich boots and fitted leather blazer over a cream-colored silk blouse. But, no worries, she\u2019d know for next time.</p><p>The elderly women immediately started to whisper and twitter, glancing at her, then whispering some more. Well, that was quick; they might be senior citizens but they knew who she was. The bartender tilted his head and gave her a welcoming smile.</p><p>She walked up to the bar. \u201cNice little place,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. We\u2019re kind of proud of it. What can I get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a cola? Diet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d He fixed her up with a drink and asked, \u201cPassing through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually. I just moved here. Well\u2014\u201d she laughed \u201c\u2014I was born not far from here and always intended to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look kind of familiar,\u201d Jack said. He shook his head. \u201cI had a little d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. You kind of reminded me of my wife for a second there. First time she walked in this place, I figured she was lost. Classy blonde in my bar? Couldn\u2019t be happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you did the right thing and married her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I gonna do?\u201d Jack asked with a laugh. He put out his hand. \u201cJack Sheridan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuriel,\u201d she said, accepting the hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou been around lately?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot lately, no. I used to visit when my folks were still alive. But over the past few years I\u2019ve just been up here on very quick trips to look at property. I\u2019ve never been in this bar before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it something worked out in terms of property?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ranch. Out on Silverton Road.\u201d</p> <p>Jack frowned. \u201cThe old Weatherby place? He didn\u2019t die, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cFinally decided to give it up and go live near the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was even available,\u201d Jack observed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was. I\u2019ve been working with a Realtor for a few years now, looking for property. I think she went visiting, telling people she might have a buyer if it was the right place. And this was the right place. Did you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Jack said, giving the counter a wipe. \u201cHe was an old-timer when I got here a few years ago. He\u2019d already sold off most of his stock, kept a couple of horses, couple of dogs and a nice garden. He was already retired. I met him a couple of times in the bar. Had a slew of kids and none of \u2019em stayed around.\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou know\u2014you make it your life\u2019s dream to get your kids a big education and, in the end, no one wants the ranch.\u201d He glanced at the tittering women. \u201cMadge and Beatrice,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey are all stirred up. Newcomers rate some attention around here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s the case,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that Weatherby place need some work?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSome serious restoration,\u201d she said, sipping her soda. \u201cBut it\u2019s solid, has a good barn and corral, and there\u2019s a guesthouse. What was Weatherby doing with a guesthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I understand it, his late wife used to like to paint, so she built herself a studio. After she died, a long while back, he turned it into a little apartment he could rent out to ranch hands or loggers. Sort of a bunkhouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that explains it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cExplains what, if you don\u2019t mind my asking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good little room with a lot of windows. But it was filthy. Like it was rented to men and not cleaned in between.\u201d She sipped her cola. \u201cThe Realtor got a crew to clean it up real nice. I gave it a coat of paint, decorated it in a small way, bought a big area rug and can live in it while I work on the bigger house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looking for a contractor?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll need some help, but I\u2019ve been looking forward to this for a long time and I want to do most of the work myself. I mean, I\u2019m not crazy\u2014I\u2019ll need help if I ever have to wire, plumb, lay flooring or put on a roof. But I\u2019m hell with a paintbrush. And, believe it or not, I\u2019ve mastered seamless wallpaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about cabinets, countertops, tile, wallboard, et cetera?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very handy. I plan to restore it, not upgrade it. It\u2019s got a lot of spirit. Some women do needlepoint, some sand and varnish.\u201d</p><p>That got a big laugh out of Jack. Right at that moment, Mel came in with David on her hip and her big belly preceding her through the door. He lifted his chin in greeting, but before Mel could make it to the bar, she was summoned over to Madge and Beatrice, who leaned their heads together and spoke intently, glancing at Jack and the woman, eyes round.</p><p>Muriel glanced at the woman and baby; no doubt about it, that would be the classy blonde who married Jack. She smiled.</p><p>Mel passed the baby over the bar to her husband, gave him a little kiss and then grinned at Muriel. She put out her hand. \u201cMuriel St. Claire,\u201d she said. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Mel Sheridan. How exciting.\u201d</p> <p>Muriel took her hand. \u201cHow do you do. I guess you know this guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow him real well, actually.\u201d Mel laughed. \u201cYou have those women over there in a fluster. They can\u2019t believe it\u2019s really you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s really me. I just moved here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer place?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>Muriel shook her head. \u201cRetirement place. Permanent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Mel asked, lifting a brow. \u201cAn early retirement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d Muriel laughed. \u201cI\u2019m so ready for a change of pace. Jesus, I\u2019ve been making movies for forty years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, wait a second here,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019m totally lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are, Jack. Muriel St. Claire is an actress, very famous, and has been since she was about...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen,\u201d Muriel supplied.</p><p>Jack did the math. \u201cYou\u2019re fifty-five?\u201d he asked, his eyebrows shooting up. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood maintenance,\u201d she said, brushing off the compliment. \u201cI\u2019m fifty-six and sick of acting. Well, not acting so much as the lifestyle that goes with it. I\u2019ve been shopping for a ranch for a few years now. My parents lived in these mountains many, many years ago. I have a couple of horses and can\u2019t wait for delivery on a couple of dogs. I have a chocolate Lab being trained in Kentucky\u2014she\u2019s a beauty. And a Lab puppy coming in a couple of weeks. Both hunters, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hunt?\u201d Mel asked, trying to keep the shock from her voice.</p><p>\u201cYou hunt?\u201d Jack asked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cWaterfowl. Duck and geese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack shoots deer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could try that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t use dogs for that and I love working the dogs. I\u2019ve always had a dog.\u201d She squinted at Mel. \u201cYou look familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met once. I don\u2019t expect you would remember me\u2014first of all it was years ago. But I lived in L.A. before moving up here and we went to the same day spa for a while. I saw you there a couple of times. I think we might\u2019ve had the same aesthetician.\u201d Jack was frowning in total confusion again. \u201cFacials,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cFantastic,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cWho do you use around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there are some decent beauty shops in Fortuna and Eureka, but probably not what you\u2019re used to. Nothing here in Virgin River.\u201d Mel glanced at Muriel\u2019s perfect nails. \u201cYou\u2019re going to go a long way for a good manicure.\u201d</p><p>Muriel followed her eyes. \u201cI can kiss these goodbye. I\u2019m going to be busy redecorating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re planning to do some of it yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of it,\u201d she said rather proudly, lifting her chin. \u201cWhat brought you up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, long story. I was looking for a change. I was a nurse-practitioner and midwife in L.A. and took a job here\u2014population just over six hundred. It was supposed to be for a year, but Jack got me knocked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are married,\u201d he said, shaking his head at her. \u201cTell the woman you\u2019re happy about that, Melinda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly happy. Jack worked out.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cMuriel has the ranch just across the pasture from the Booth place. About six miles by car, or a mile and a half down the river on a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fantastic. You\u2019re going to love that family,\u201d Mel said. \u201cWalt\u2019s a retired general with a couple of grown kids and a new grandson. Great people. In fact, Virgin River is a whole town of really nice people. I\u2019ll look forward to introducing you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s real nice of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind you,\u201d Mel continued, \u201conce Madge and Beatrice over there get on the phone, formal introductions won\u2019t be necessary. Maybe we should put them out of their misery. Would you like to go over and say hi before they go into shock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d Muriel said.</p><p>\u201cAh, wait a second,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAre we going to have a lot of those reporters and photographers around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaparazzi?\u201d Muriel asked. \u201cI highly doubt it. I\u2019m old news. The wild, half-dressed young girls are keeping them very busy these days.\u201d And then she flashed him a dazzling smile.</p><p>With Tom at Brenda\u2019s, and Vanni gone to Grants Pass with Paul for a few days, Walt faced two choices for dinner\u2014throw a piece of meat on the grill, or get something at Jack\u2019s. He got in the car.</p><p>There were about ten people in the bar when Walt arrived, all of them sitting at tables except Doc, who was up at the bar. Walt joined him there, leaving one stool to separate them. Doc and Walt merely nodded at each other; Doc wasn\u2019t usually given to deep conversation. Jack grinned at Walt and slapped down a napkin. \u201cWell, now. What can I do for you, sir?\u201d</p><p>Walt peered at the empty baby pack Jack was wearing. \u201cLose a rider, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid\u2019s off being \u2018refreshed,\u2019\u201d Jack said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cHow about a beer while you tell me what Preacher\u2019s got cooking tonight?\u201d</p><p>Jack drew the draft and put it in front of him. \u201cSunday special\u2014pot roast. I don\u2019t know what the man uses for seasoning, but it\u2019s so damn good. And the gravy\u2019s almost like tar, it\u2019s so dark. He cooked it with vegetables but he\u2019s serving whipped potatoes on the side. They\u2019re like silk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Walt said, lifting his beer.</p><p>\u201cYou want takeout for the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust me tonight. Vanni\u2019s gone up to Oregon with Paul for a few days, and I don\u2019t rate much time with Tom while he\u2019s on Brenda\u2019s dance card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOregon?\u201d Jack said with a lift of his brow. \u201cYou don\u2019t say? What do you suppose they\u2019ll find to do in Oregon?\u201d</p><p>Walt smiled at him. \u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cSounds like maybe some things got sorted out. This mean we won\u2019t be seeing too much of that nice Dr. Michaels around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think maybe that nice Dr. Michaels hanging around lit a fire under Paul,\u201d Walt said. \u201cGood man, Haggerty. If a little slow.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t go too hard on him, General. I think Vanessa scared him to death. She\u2019s awful pretty. Wicked smart, too.\u201d</p><p>Walt appreciated the compliment and smiled. \u201cHell, sometimes she scares me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go give Preach your order. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>Walt had enjoyed about half his brew when Mel came from the back and took the stool beside him. \u201cHey, there,\u201d she said brightly. \u201cJack said you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you feeling, girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady to pop. But I\u2019m hanging in there.\u201d Jack came out with the carrier full of baby again, holding two steaming plates. He put them in front of Walt and Mel. \u201cMind if I join you for dinner?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d welcome it. Jack\u2019s not eating dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been helping Preacher all afternoon make sure it\u2019s just right. I\u2019ve probably had three dinners already,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou just missed your new neighbor by about an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Walt said, digging in. \u201cWho might that be?\u201d</p><p>Mel leaned an elbow on the bar. \u201cDoes the name Muriel St. Claire mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say that it does,\u201d he said. He took a mouthful. \u201cBy damn, that Preacher,\u201d he said, savoring the seasoned, tender beef. \u201cHe\u2019s got the gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an actress, Walt,\u201d Mel explained. \u201cQuite famous, actually. I\u2019ve seen a lot of her films.\u201d</p><p>Walt hummed in response, more interested in his food. Finally he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s she doing around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says she came from these mountains and decided to return, retire here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what we need,\u201d Walt said. \u201cAnother little old lady. Is she rich at least?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looked pretty rich to me,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnd not exactly old.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRich, retired movie star? What\u2019s she going to do with a ranch? Raise exotic chickens?\u201d</p><p>Mel laughed. \u201cYou might be in for some surprises. She moved into that old Weatherby place on the other side of your pasture. You should bake her a cake or something. Go say hello. I told her you Booths were nice people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put Vanni right on it when she gets back to town,\u201d Walt said.</p> <p>Mel perked right up. \u201cVanni\u2019s out of town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone to Grants Pass for a few days with Paul,\u201d Walt said, hardly missing a mouthful. \u201cThey\u2019ll be back by the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how about that,\u201d Mel said, smiling. \u201cWere you expecting that?\u201d</p><p>Walt dabbed his lips with his napkin. \u201cGirl, the finger\u2019s been on that trigger for months. The only thing I didn\u2019t expect was how long it would take Haggerty to pull it.\u201d</p><p>When Walt got home, the house was dismally quiet. He turned on the TV for some noise and picked up a book for something to do. He wished Tom would show up with Brenda and take over the TV for a movie or something, but they probably wouldn\u2019t. If they could escape Brenda\u2019s house, they\u2019d be buried in the woods, parking. He\u2019d like to hear the baby fuss, or Vanni cooing to him. Paul would make decent company right about now\u2014he could do that running commentary they had in response to CNN stories.</p> <p>Out of sheer boredom, he went to the computer. He started a search of Muriel St. Claire, his new neighbor. He found several Web sites plus a Wikipedia listing. Fifty-six years old, born in Brother Creek, California. He looked it up\u2014Trinity County, right near the Humboldt line. There was a list of movies\u2014Jesus, almost fifty of them, not to mention television credits. When he saw a photo he recognized her, but only because she\u2019d recently been on Law and Order and CSI. He\u2019d never in a million years have known her name. He ran through a series of publicity photos\u2014none in the recent past. Blond, sleek, large blue eyes. Too thin, he decided, although she could certainly hold up a strapless black dress. She always appeared to be glancing over her bare shoulder at the camera, or leaning into it with those sultry movie-star eyes. There was even a shot of her in bed, the only visible fabric being a satin sheet. And pictures of her taken at Academy Awards and the Cannes Film Festival\u2014lotsa big jewelry.</p><p>His wife had never much liked big jewelry.</p><p>It was all Hollywood stuff, dedicated to the superficial. She\u2019d obviously be more at home in a marble mansion with a pool. What the hell was she doing with that old Weatherby ranch house? That wouldn\u2019t last long.</p><p>\u201cExotic chickens, my ass,\u201d Walt muttered to himself as he shut down the computer and headed for bed.</p><p>Nine</p><p>I n the early morning Vanni felt the bed dip as Paul brought her a freshly diapered and hungry baby, placing him between them.</p> <p>\u201cWell, good morning, my angel,\u201d she murmured, kissing the baby\u2019s head. He sent up a loud protest at kisses instead of milk and she snuggled him close to nurse.</p><p>Paul stretched out on the bed to watch Vanessa and the baby. His hand wandered affectionately from Mattie\u2019s little head to Vanessa\u2019s soft, mussed hair. The baby made a lot of noise this morning, which made Paul laugh. \u201cHave you been starving him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always starving,\u201d she said. \u201cTime for him to get some solid food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said the breast only for six months? He\u2019s barely over three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but look at him. He\u2019s ravenous. Maybe he could use a little cereal...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s awesome, and growing damn fat on the breast,\u201d Paul said. \u201cVanessa, call Carol and Lance about a visit, find out when they can see you. Then I\u2019ll get in touch with my mom about a family thing. I\u2019ll try to get more details about Terri\u2019s pregnancy while we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should meet your family right away,\u201d she said. \u201cMake sure they\u2019re not all as crazy as you are. Are you going to tell them about Terri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until I know something for sure. But I want to tell them about us\u2014that we\u2019re getting married when we can get our plans together. Is that all right? Because I can\u2019t look at you without wanting everyone to know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. I have the same problem,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cThis is the part about being married that I like. Lying beside you in bed...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby between us...\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHe has his needs. And if you want more children, you\u2019d better get used to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he said, stroking the baby\u2019s soft head, \u201cis everything I\u2019ve ever wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo odd that you didn\u2019t find someone to marry years ago. You\u2019re so good at it. And this thing you have for pregnant women and babies...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a while there it seemed like everyone had a pregnant wife but me. Between my brothers and my friends, I was surrounded by them. Round bellies, nursing babies...Is there some rule about waiting a respectable length of time between the first \u2018I love you\u2019 and the vows?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference? We\u2019ve known each other for years. We\u2019ve been through things together that even some husbands and wives haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would your father think if we got married right away?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cDaddy scares everyone but me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything I want suits him fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe person most on my mind is Tom,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cTommy? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten real close. He\u2019s like one of my brothers. And the way he feels about you\u2014he tries to hide it, but he admires you. We can\u2019t do it without him. He\u2019s leaving right after graduation, but I want him to be there. I want him to be my best man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would your family feel about a fast wedding?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cRelieved, believe me. My mother\u2019s secret fear is that I\u2019ll die a lonely old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, you can\u2019t tell your family that one woman is having your baby and you\u2019re marrying another all in the same sentence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m going to get the facts as soon as possible\u2014but, Vanni, the bottom line will be the same, whether it comes in one sentence or one month. I\u2019ll take care of them, I\u2019ll take care of you\u2014but you\u2019re going to be my wife. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been thinking about this....\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about lying next to you all night that disturbs my sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny that you didn\u2019t disturb mine,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d give you a break. But your break is almost over.\u201d</p><p>Mattie drew in a deep sigh and fell away from the breast, satisfied and asleep. Paul leaned over the baby\u2019s head to place a soft kiss on her lips. He then kissed the baby\u2019s head and asked, \u201cWould you like to hold him a while longer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll put him down,\u201d she said, beginning to rise.</p><p>\u201cStay right there. Let me,\u201d he said, scooping the baby into his arms. Mattie\u2019s head fell right to Paul\u2019s shoulder and before Paul had made it out of the bedroom, a loud, sleepy belch escaped the little boy.</p><p>Vanni chuckled and snuggled into the bed. Happy. She let her eyes close, but not for sleep. For a long time she had been afraid she\u2019d never get to feel this way again. And then her man was back, pulling her into his arms, covering her mouth in a kiss that was not soft, drawing a deep moan from her as her arms went around him.</p><p>Later that morning Vanessa phoned Carol. \u201cHi. I\u2019m going to be in town for a couple of days and I thought if you had time, I\u2019d bring little Matt over for a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in town?\u201d she asked. \u201cWill you stay with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but thanks. I decided to come at the very last minute and I\u2019m staying with Paul. He was in Virgin River so I came back up here with him, since he\u2019s going right back to Virgin River at the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy, he\u2019s spending a lot of time in Virgin River,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>\u201cHe is, with more time there in his future. He has a couple of potential building contracts down there, if it doesn\u2019t interfere with his company up here. It seemed like a perfect opportunity to bring the baby over to see you and Lance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Make it tonight,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cWe\u2019ll have dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Vanni agreed.</p><p>\u201cGreat! Six o\u2019clock. Do you need a ride?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Paul will bring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, then. We\u2019ll do something on the grill.\u201d</p><p>Vanni spent the whole day alone with Mattie while Paul went to his office, checked on his crews, saw his brothers and tried to catch up on business in general. He was home in plenty of time to shower and change to go to the Rutledges\u2019 home.</p><p>When Carol opened the door to them, she actually stepped back in surprise. \u201cPaul!\u201d she said with a gasp.</p><p>\u201cHi, Carol,\u201d he said. He gently squeezed Vanni\u2019s upper arm. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! Great! Come in! Will you be staying for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019ll stay for dinner, Carol,\u201d Vanni said, totally confused by this question. \u201cWhen I told you he would bring me, did you think he\u2019d just drop me off? Didn\u2019t you expect him to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, reaching for the baby. \u201cI\u2019ll just set another place.\u201d</p><p>Vanni passed her the baby, completely baffled. There was protocol and obligation with grandparents, not to mention the promise she\u2019d made to Matt, and she held that sacred. But Carol never failed to put her under a strain. Most of the time she didn\u2019t understand her. As they walked into the house, Vanni glanced into the dining room and noticed a table set for four. She was totally perplexed, until they stepped into the living room and Cameron stood up from his chair.</p><p>It was then she realized that Carol was at it again\u2014and two extremely fine men were going to be made uncomfortable. She wore a sad smile as she went toward Cameron and allowed him to kiss her cheek. \u201cHow are you?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she answered. Paul came up behind her and put that hand on her shoulder, that hand that claimed her. She was sorry about how that would make Cameron feel, but not at all unhappy about how it made her feel. After wanting him so much, she loved letting the world know she was his.</p><p>\u201cCameron,\u201d Paul said, sticking out his other hand from his place behind Vanni.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing?\u201d he asked, shaking the hand. \u201cSo\u2014just in town for a couple of days?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cPaul was down for the weekend and I decided to come back here with him. To meet his family. I\u2019m staying at Paul\u2019s, Cameron....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, understanding perfectly. He turned and lifted his drink to his lips.</p><p>Lance came into the room, saw that Paul was there and welcomed him heartily. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, reaching out his hand. \u201cMy man Paul! How is everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Never better. How about you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe same,\u201d Lance answered. \u201cWhere\u2019s that baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol took him to the kitchen,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t mean to seem rude, but I have to have a grandson fix. Be right back,\u201d he said, darting off.</p><p>The three of them stood there, looking at each other. It was Cameron who broke the tension with a laugh. \u201cWell. Looks like a serious miscommunication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Paul said. \u201cCarol has a very specific plan in mind and she didn\u2019t bother to consult anyone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe can make the best of this, can\u2019t we?\u201d Vanni asked hopefully.</p><p>Cameron smiled at her, but it was a disappointed smile. Carol flew out from the kitchen, headed toward the dining room with a plate, napkin and utensils in her hands. She had obviously handed off the baby to Lance. \u201cCarol, wait,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to shove off. My pager,\u201d he lied. \u201cThanks, but I\u2019m not going to be able to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d Carol said. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p> <p>He put one hand in his pants pocket. \u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said. He leaned forward and gave Vanni a kiss on the cheek. \u201cYou look terrific,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know you\u2019re happy.\u201d He gave Paul a conciliatory slap on the upper arm as he passed and headed toward the door.</p><p>Paul squeezed her shoulder. He leaned down to her ear. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d And he followed Cameron.</p><p>Cameron was making fast tracks to his car when Paul called to him. \u201cHey, Cameron. Buddy. A minute, huh?\u201d</p><p>Cameron turned. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Paul. You don\u2019t have to say anything. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d he said, taking another two long strides toward him. The two men were completely different\u2014Paul in his jeans and boots, rough, rugged. Cameron in his linen pants, silk shirt, Italian shoes\u2014possibly the best-dressed man in Grants Pass. \u201cI think you deserve some kind of explanation. About me. Me and Vanessa. This was a horrible setup.\u201d</p> <p>Cameron put his hands in his pockets, rocked back on his heels and laughed ruefully. \u201cIt was pretty ugly,\u201d he agreed. \u201cMaybe more terrible for you and Vanni than for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what Carol told you, and I don\u2019t know why she brought you out to dinner, but I\u2019ve been in love with Vanni forever. I couldn\u2019t tell her that, of course\u2014she married my best friend. God, I\u2019d never have done anything that wrong to Matt. But since...Well, we\u2019ve been through so much together and it just got stronger. It took a long time to iron it out. Man, I\u2019m really sorry if you were misled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only known her a few weeks, Paul. We\u2019re not exactly confidants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>Cameron stiffened slightly, but he smiled. He nodded. \u201cCongratulations. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t hard for me to understand you have a thing for her. What man wouldn\u2019t? I want you to know something\u2014this is my fault, Cameron. I should have spoken up sooner. Before Carol set up that first meeting with you. There\u2019s no excuse. I knew how I felt. But Matt hadn\u2019t been gone long and I\u2014\u201d He hung his head, shaking it briefly. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to upset her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe could have spoken up,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>\u201cWell, it turns out there\u2019s an explanation for that, too. I was real scarce for a while after the baby was born, trying to give her time and to get my head together. It was real hard for me to get into Matt\u2019s territory, even after he was gone. I gave her the impression I wasn\u2019t interested in her in that way.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not good with women. I\u2019m real clumsy, in fact. But at least it\u2019s finally out\u2014how we feel about each other. Now we move ahead. I\u2019m sorry, man,\u201d he said, sticking out his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re a good guy. You have everything. There\u2019s no reason I should win this one.\u201d</p><p>Cameron gave a huff of laughter. He took the hand. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s lots of reasons. No hard feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. This, between us\u2014it shouldn\u2019t be hard for her. She\u2019s so sensitive. She\u2019d hate for anyone to be hurt. I happen to know\u2014she thinks highly of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve her, I know that. But I\u2019m going to do everything I can to make her happy. I hope you\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could gloat, you know,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cYou got the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cCrazy woman.\u201d He laughed. \u201cA guy like you\u2014you won\u2019t have any trouble. The right one will come along.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPaul. I didn\u2019t close the deal, all right? It barely got going. I might be a little disappointed, but that\u2019s all. Vanni and I\u2014we were just friends. In case you think I\u2019m going to be a problem for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I know better than that. Didn\u2019t take me long to figure you for a class act.\u201d</p><p>Cameron smiled. \u201cYeah? Well, maybe I\u2019m not the only one.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa sat in the chair that had recently been Cameron\u2019s. The baby was out of sight with Lance and so was Carol for the moment. Vanni was seething. Beyond furious. She picked up Cameron\u2019s drink and took a long, deep swallow of liquid courage and grimaced at the taste of scotch. It was another minute before Carol showed herself.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Carol said. \u201cThat was a bit uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d invited Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t? And why didn\u2019t you insist he be invited? He was Matt\u2019s best friend. And you know how much he means to me!\u201d</p><p>Carol stiffened indignantly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I do,\u201d she said.</p><p>Vanni stood to meet Carol at eye level. \u201cThen let me be very clear about this. He means the absolute world to me. Paul was in Virgin River when Matt was killed and I asked him to stay on until the baby was born. I asked him to be with me for the birth. I\u2019ve known him for years. I\u2019ve always felt comfortable with him, I trust him\u2014he\u2019s wonderful. We\u2019ve always been close, closer still when we lost Matt. For God\u2019s sake, Matt asked him to take care of us if anything happened to him. How can it be so impossible for you to understand that I would come to love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine it,\u201d Carol said, anger barely reined in. \u201cMatt\u2019s hardly gone...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone enough for you to try to set me up with a doctor.\u201d</p><p>Carol lifted her chin. Her mouth took on a strained line. \u201cThat\u2019s uncalled for!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you treat Paul as if he\u2019s inferior! Shame on you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never meant that. I never meant to\u2014\u201d Carol swallowed. \u201cI thought Cameron was perfect for you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron knew about me and Paul. What in the world did you tell him to get him here for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...ah...I told him Paul was dropping you off and you\u2019d love to see him. I didn\u2019t think I was making it up\u2014you said Paul coming back here from Virgin River was a perfect opportunity to visit us and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Vanni was shaking her head. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask if I\u2019d like Cameron to join us for dinner? More to the point, why don\u2019t you listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do listen,\u201d she said, insulted.</p><p>\u201cNo. You don\u2019t listen. When I say I don\u2019t want coral bridesmaids\u2019 dresses, you buy them and dress up my girls in them. When I say I don\u2019t want to be set up, you invite the man to dinner not once, but twice. When I say I\u2019m staying with Paul and he\u2019ll bring me to dinner, you plan your own party without asking, without listening. For heaven\u2019s sake, Cameron is a wonderful man who didn\u2019t deserve what just happened to him. And that you would humiliate Paul after knowing him for so many years, after knowing how he loved your only son, treating him like he\u2019s my chauffeur, offering to set another place like he\u2019s some last-minute addition to your private little dinner party...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just couldn\u2019t imagine it. Not Paul,\u201d she said.</p><p>Lance appeared, coming out of the kitchen with his grandson cuddled against his chest, and the expression on his face was not a happy one. Carol said, \u201cI was trying to help....Maybe Mattie could benefit by being raised by a doctor. Instead of...\u201d She glanced away uncomfortably.</p><p>Vanni laughed suddenly and hollowly. Here the woman was in real estate and had no concept of how successful the man who built some of the finest houses in the region might be. And that was nothing compared to the fact that Paul was the most incredible human being, and would be the most wonderful father. \u201cPaul is such a catch, you can\u2019t even imagine, but I\u2019m not going to waste your time. Carol, I\u2019m sick of the way you take over and I won\u2019t have it anymore.\u201d She walked toward Lance and reached for the baby just as Paul was coming in the front door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lance, but we\u2019re leaving. This was horrendous, and I\u2019m never going through anything like this again.\u201d She looked over her shoulder at Paul, who stood across the room, just inside the door. In his eyes she saw warmth and understanding. Patience. Kindness. Everything was going to be okay.</p><p>Vanni walked over to Paul. She turned at the door and said, \u201cCarol, you should be more considerate of people\u2019s feelings. What you did tonight was in bad taste, it\u2019s beneath you.\u201d And with that they left the house.</p><p>The next night was dinner with the Haggertys and Vanessa was tense. After what she\u2019d been through with Carol Rutledge, she couldn\u2019t imagine what kind of paces these people might put her through. The fact that Paul was so down-to-earth and kind didn\u2019t reassure her much. After all, Matt had been so charming and fun, yet Carol could be a nightmare. When Paul drove up to the large, stately home in the beautiful countryside, Vanni gulped. Another big house. She knew their family business was successful, but at this point their obvious prosperity was making her nervous. It seemed to be the fulcrum on which so many opinions were balanced. Opinions that had little to do with the true quality of life.</p><p>But this was a whole different scene. Marianne Haggerty rushed to the front door when she heard them pulling up, drying her hands on a dish towel that she immediately flung over her shoulder. She was a short, round woman with steel-gray hair and a beautiful complexion. Her smile was effervescent and she had the most wonderful, engaging dimples. Right behind her was a tall, handsome man, Paul\u2019s height, with Paul\u2019s sandy-colored hair, strung with gray.</p><p>Marianne gave Paul a peck on the cheek and then quickly focused on the baby, reaching for him. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMatt\u2019s baby, how luscious. Oh, Vanessa\u2014it\u2019s so wonderful to finally meet you! Matt was so precious to us\u2014we loved him so. Can I hold him? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Vanni said with a smile, handing him over.</p><p>Like grandparents, Marianne and Stan were focused on the baby, smiling and cooing and snuggling, almost ignoring Paul and Vanni. And then, surprisingly, Marianne began to tear up. Then weep. Stan put a strong arm around her shoulders, holding her and the baby against his big chest, murmuring to her, \u201cAll right, honey. Don\u2019t get started...\u201d And then his eyes welled and a tear ran down his weathered cheek and they were wiping at each other\u2019s cheeks while cuddling the baby.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you two,\u201d Paul said. \u201cLet\u2019s not get going. Don\u2019t upset Vanni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Marianne said immediately. She looked at Vanessa with wet eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll just never know how grateful I am for this chance to see him, to hold him. We loved Matt so much. I always felt that he was one of my boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, if you don\u2019t get under control, I\u2019ll take the baby,\u201d Paul threatened.</p><p>Vanni laid a hand on his arm and shook her head at him, a small smile playing on her lips. This was good for her\u2014Carol and Lance didn\u2019t get choked up like this. There was no question in her mind that the Rutledges loved their grandson, but their restraint was sometimes hard to endure, especially during those times she was feeling emotional.</p><p>\u201cBeer,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe need beer. And control.\u201d</p><p>Stan let go with a hearty though shaky laugh. \u201cGreat recipe for control,\u201d he said. \u201cBeer. Come on, come on in.\u201d He reached for Vanni\u2019s hand and pulled her into the house, wiping clumsily at his cheeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was led through the foyer, past a gorgeous and huge great room with a beautiful marble fireplace, past a large dining room and huge kitchen, out onto a redwood deck that was furnished with handsome wicker patio furniture that would be as much at home in a living room as outdoors.</p><p>\u201cThis is an amazing house,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give you the tour later if you want one,\u201d Stan said. \u201cA builder\u2019s house has to be a good house\u2014people look at that. It\u2019s way more than we need, for sure, but Marianne wants room for the family. What can I get everyone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love a beer,\u201d Vanni said, sitting in one of the chairs outside.</p><p>Marianne followed, still clutching the baby possessively, holding him against her. \u201cSure, sweetie,\u201d she said to her husband without ever taking her eyes off the baby. She migrated to a chair near Vanessa while Paul went with his dad to get beer. \u201cHe\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cSo sweet. Is he a good baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cSleeps through the night and is hardly ever in a bad mood. But of course he gets a lot of attention, so I\u2019m sure when he\u2019s older, I\u2019ll be in for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t give a baby too much attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul tells me you have five grandchildren.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThree boys, two girls. They\u2019re brilliant, each one. Oh, I could eat this little one up!\u201d Marianne turned her eyes toward Vanni and said softly, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for your loss, Vanessa. We miss him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I remember your card and flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was so wonderful for Paul to be with you when this one was born. He talks about it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDoes he tell you about how hard he tried to get out of it?\u201d she asked just as Paul came back onto the deck to hand her a beer. He stood behind her chair and that hand was again on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t admit to that, but it doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d his mother said.</p><p>Vanni reached up to caress the hand that possessed her. And it wasn\u2019t until that moment that Marianne\u2019s expression changed and she exchanged looks with her husband.</p> <p>\u201cYes, Mom,\u201d Paul said. \u201cOnce I told Vanni what wonderful grandparents you two are, she agreed to marry me. She even agreed to more children. So you see\u2014I\u2019m not going to die a lonely old man after all.\u201d Vanni looked up at him and saw that his smile was soft.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Marianne let go in a surprised breath. \u201cOh, how long has this been going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me, quite a while,\u201d Paul said. \u201cVanni just gave up the fight a little while ago. But I think she can convince you she\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Vanni said, \u201cI\u2019m happy. Very happy.\u201d</p><p>Stan stuck out a hand to his son. \u201cCongratulations, son. This is good news.\u201d Then he stooped to put a kiss on Vanni\u2019s cheek. \u201cWelcome, daughter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor. An honor.\u201d</p><p>All Marianne said was, \u201cExcellent. I don\u2019t have to let go of this baby for a second!\u201d Then her face sobered and she said, \u201cOh, forgive me, Vanessa! I\u2019m so happy to have you in the family.\u201d She grinned happily and said, \u201cYou and the baby!\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before the rest of the Haggerty family arrived\u2014Mitch and Jenny and their three kids, North and Susan and their two\u2014the women bearing food to contribute to a big family dinner. Vanni was welcomed warmly with hugs, everyone offering their condolences for Matt\u2019s death since the boys had grown up together. The baby was fussed over and passed from woman to woman. In no time Paul had charge of the baby while Vanni joined the women in the kitchen getting the meal on the table.</p><p>Dinner with eight adults, five kids and a baby is a loud affair, but Vanni felt so much more comfortable in the chaos than she ever had at the Rutledges\u2019. Paul\u2019s mother, she thought, has such an ideal existence, surrounded by loving family, her life filled with happy noise and small children\u2019s arms around her.</p> <p>This, Vanni thought. This is what I want to do next.</p><p>Before dinner was consumed, Stan stood and raised a glass to toast Vanessa and Paul\u2019s engagement. Excited whoops and hugs followed with questions about the when and where, to which Vanni and Paul could only answer, \u201cThe sooner the better. After all\u2014we\u2019ve known each other for years.\u201d</p><p>When dinner was over, the cleanup and female chatter continued, and Vanni pitched in happily. It was during this time that she stole a look at Paul, out on the deck with his father and brothers, jiggling Mattie against his chest, trying to keep him from getting too fussy as he waited for his mother\u2019s attention. Mattie was squirming anxiously, ready for a feeding, but Paul was completely comfortable and confident.</p><p>When the last dish was put up, Vanni asked Marianne if she could borrow a bedroom to nurse the baby. \u201cOf course, sweetheart,\u201d the older woman answered. \u201cBut no one in this family is uncomfortable with a nursing mom, not even the children. Do whatever you\u2019d rather\u2014take a bedroom or sit with us, it\u2019s entirely up to you. We\u2019re kind of homespun around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the men?\u201d Vanni asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re even less uncomfortable.\u201d North\u2019s wife laughed. \u201cThe first time I put Angie to the breast, demurely covered by a blanket, Stan walked right over to me, lifted the blanket and said, \u2018Marianne, honey, come and see how good this little critter sucks!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cThink they\u2019ll stay outside a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Stan will give you time to get used to us before he pulls his tricks,\u201d Marianne said with a smile. \u201cNot much time, though\u2014take that as fair warning.\u201d</p><p>So Vanni went to collect her son from Paul and chose the great room, settling with the women, who had a hundred questions about Vanni and Paul and how the whole romance came to be.</p><p>On the deck, Paul was talking to his business partners, his family. \u201cI think there\u2019s money to be made in Virgin River and the surrounding towns. When Jack was looking for a contractor to help him finish his house, he couldn\u2019t find one, which was what brought me down there.\u201d He grinned. \u201cThat and all the overtime he paid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you prefer to do it?\u201d Mitch asked.</p><p>\u201cI could extend the company into another branch and we could participate in any profits, or I could use my house equity to start my own company, since the house is paid for. I leave that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have plenty of stock in Haggerty Construction,\u201d Stan said. \u201cIf you want to cash out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to pull money out of your company, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not mine, son. We\u2019ve all put a lot of sweat equity into this operation\u2014it\u2019s ours. We back each other up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni would move up here if I asked her to. But I have interests there. There are building contracts, there\u2019s Vanni\u2019s dad, who\u2019s alone now. And...Well, there\u2019s Matt. I want Mattie to have a connection to his dad, to know everything about what a great man he was.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re close to Grants Pass\u2014it\u2019s not a bad drive. If I hang on to the house, we could come back up here to work if there aren\u2019t contracts down there. You know I wouldn\u2019t be a stranger. But God, Dad, it\u2019s a beautiful place. I\u2019d love to raise a family there. I\u2019d love to live there with my wife and children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll set you up, son. Sounds like a place primed for opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could provide jobs\u2014there are a lot of people looking for opportunity in home construction. And a lot of city money comes up to us from the Bay Area. Virgin River is isolated and grows slowly, but there are dozens of towns around the area just dying for renovation and new construction. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll regret it\u2014but I\u2019d rather you not shoulder the risk. I can afford it.\u201d</p><p>Stan grinned. \u201cYou saying we made you rich enough to start your own company?\u201d</p><p>Paul returned the grin. \u201cYou did, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you owe it to us to give us a piece of the action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Mitch said.</p><p>\u201cI hate to lose you,\u201d North said. \u201cIf you take on a new division, we\u2019ll have to put someone in charge of building operations up here. And damn, you\u2019re the best there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been pretty absent since last fall. A long time now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Stan agreed. \u201cBut it looks like it was a good investment, personally and professionally. Anyone around here have cigars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have cigars,\u201d North said.</p><p>\u201cI do, don\u2019t I?\u201d Stan said, getting up.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Paul said. \u201cYou guys have to come down to Virgin River. You\u2019re going to fit right in.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>W alt had begun making it a habit to be away from the house for long periods of time when Paul was there for the weekend. He stretched out his stable chores and frequently took Liberty out for long early-morning or early-evening rides. His reward for this new behavior was a decent night\u2019s sleep.</p><p>It appeared these trips to Grants Pass during the week would continue for a while, and the kids would be back on the weekends. He looked forward to seeing them, but they also needed their space. So, after Friday night\u2019s dinner at the house, with Tom out with Brenda, Walt left cleanup to Paul and Vanni and went for a ride.</p><p>He was moving along the river trail when an animal darted down the path toward him. It wasn\u2019t much more than a streak of brown fur and Walt reined in Patriot. He could hear horse\u2019s hooves and then the air was split with a loud whistle and that chocolate streak stopped on a dime. And sat. Panting.</p><p>Momentarily, a horse galloped up toward him, a pretty woman astride. She wore a cowboy hat, but even that wide brim couldn\u2019t hide her peachy complexion, rosy cheeks, pink lips. \u201cGood girl, Luce. Break.\u201d</p><p>The dog got out of her sit position, at ease, and wagged at her mistress.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d the woman said to Walt. \u201cI hope that wasn\u2019t a problem for you, or for your horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine. Amazing little friend you have there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuce. She\u2019s a bird dog, still in training. I\u2019m Muriel. Are we neighbors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalt Booth,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a little embarrassed. I\u2019ve been meaning to bake you a cake and bring it over. Welcome you to the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you were planning to have your wife do that,\u201d she accused.</p><p>\u201cWidowed,\u201d he said, and he plucked his hat off his head in gentlemanly fashion. And curiously, he wondered what his hair looked like. That should have been his first clue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYears ago now,\u201d he answered, smoothing a hand over his head. \u201cHow about you? Married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral times,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m trying to quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have much trouble. There aren\u2019t so many prospects in Virgin River. What use do you have for a bird dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been known to hunt. I don\u2019t know how much of that I\u2019ll get in this year\u2014I\u2019m working on that house. But Luce needs a little time on her skills and I should get her in the water before too long. Keep her up to speed. I\u2019d like to get a litter out of her in a couple of years, after we check her hips. She\u2019s got such a good line.\u201d</p><p>Walt looked at her hands. They weren\u2019t fancy-girl hands. Her manicured nails were short and she wore no rings.</p><p>\u201cDo you hunt?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t in a while, but I\u2019m planning to get back into it. Soon.\u201d It made her smile at him; she knew a flirt when she saw one. \u201cI guess I thought you\u2019d be breeding peacocks on that ranch. Or something. Not working on a house and training a bird dog.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tilted her head. \u201cAnd you would think that because...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel told me my new neighbor was a movie star, so I looked you up on the Internet. Lotta fancy pictures,\u201d he said. And then he felt his cheeks grow warm.</p><p>\u201cWell, God bless the Internet. Anything else you\u2019d like to know?\u201d</p> <p>His first thought was he could probably find out who all those husbands had been, but maybe he\u2019d resist. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about movies. Haven\u2019t seen too many. And I don\u2019t know anything about movie stars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRetired,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sanding, varnishing, hauling trash and training my bird dog. I\u2019m going to pick up another one pretty soon now\u2014I picked the bitch and sire a while ago and she whelped, so as soon as they\u2019ll let him go...And I don\u2019t cook much, don\u2019t bake at all, but as it happens I have sugar for my coffee. In case you want to borrow a cup for that cake you\u2019re baking me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thirty-year-old daughter has a man in her life\u2014a good man\u2014and they\u2019re at the house every weekend,\u201d he found himself explaining. \u201cI have reasons to stay out of the house a lot. How much sugar do you keep on hand?\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cPlenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might need some as early as tomorrow evening,\u201d he said. \u201cThat good man my daughter has is here for the weekend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Then Muriel turned her mount, facing the other way and said, \u201cLuce!\u201d She gave two short whistles. The Lab bolted back where she\u2019d come from. Muriel looked over her shoulder and said, \u201cBring a decent bottle of red wine then,\u201d she said. She put her horse into an easy canter and followed her dog.</p><p>Walt sat there for a long time, till she was out of sight. \u201cDamn,\u201d he said aloud.</p><p>The next evening Paul and Vanessa decided to go to Jack\u2019s for dinner, a predictable event for them. Of course they expected Walt to join them. \u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cI see enough of Jack during the week. Tom gets dinner at Brenda\u2019s and I have no interest in cooking for one. I\u2019ll pass. In fact,\u201d he said, \u201cI might head out to Clear River. There\u2019s a little bar over there where I\u2019m not so well known. I might do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure, Dad?\u201d Vanni asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said. \u201cEnjoy yourselves. I\u2019ll see you later, or in the morning.\u201d</p><p>When they were gone he showered, applied a little aftershave and poked around in the wine rack, selected a bottle and grabbed his car keys.</p> <p>When Walt pulled up to his new neighbor\u2019s house, he wasn\u2019t sure that he wouldn\u2019t come off looking like some old fool, chasing a movie star. Of course, the chasing hadn\u2019t even started\u2014this was just a glass of wine with a neighbor. But he felt every second of his sixty-two years and although the research said she was just a few years younger, she looked many years younger than he did. And far more confident than he was.</p><p>The property was made up of a timeworn two-story house with a wide porch, a smaller vintage bunkhouse, a barn and a corral. Walt didn\u2019t know where to look first. On instinct, he went to the house and knocked on the front door. \u201cRight in here,\u201d she yelled. \u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>As Walt stepped inside he was greeted first by a very excited Luce, wagging and nudging him playfully. Muriel was up on a ladder with a trowel in her hand, which she put in a pan. She wore overalls that were as splattered as the wall. \u201cGood. Break time,\u201d she said, wiping her hands on a rag that she had stuffed in her back pocket.</p><p>Hmm. He had showered and splashed on the cologne; she hadn\u2019t even bothered with a comb, much less makeup. She looked real good for a woman her age. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019re doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSpackling. After which I\u2019ll paint and install new baseboards, and then I\u2019m going after some crown molding.\u201d</p><p>He looked around at the mess. The place was in full remodel mode. He lifted the bottle and pointed the label toward her as she descended the ladder. \u201cWill this do?\u201d</p><p>She took the bottle from him. \u201cNice,\u201d she said. \u201cGive me a minute to clean up my tools.\u201d She grabbed her pan and trowel, disappeared into the kitchen and he heard the water run. Momentarily she was back. \u201cCome with me. Come on, Luce.\u201d</p><p>He followed her out of the house and across the yard to the bunkhouse. She opened the door and surprised him again. It was one whole room, but it was a big room\u2014as a bunkhouse it could\u2019ve held six twin-size beds. She had a bed in one corner, a settee and chair in front of it, a small table with two chairs and, along one wall a few appliances\u2014a bar-size refrigerator, microwave, small oven, sink, a few cupboards and drawers. The bathroom, such as it was, occupied the corner\u2014a toilet, sink and small shower\u2014right out in the open.</p> <p>But she had the room fixed up a little bit\u2014fresh paint, bright colors of yellow, red, a little rose and pale green. The bedspread matched the love seat and chair cushions.</p><p>While he was looking around, she was digging a corkscrew out of a drawer. She handed him the bottle and the implement and went after glasses. \u201cNice little place,\u201d he said, going to work on the cork. \u201cHope I don\u2019t have to pee while I\u2019m here. More to the point, I hope you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Muriel laughed, then she grabbed something that leaned up against the end of her cupboard and, one-handed, glasses in the other hand, she erected a wooden TV tray between the chair and short couch. \u201cInstant coffee table,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease pour.\u201d</p><p>She went to the refrigerator and pulled out a platter covered in Saran, then grabbed a big box of crackers out of a cupboard and placed it on the tray next to her platter. Sliced ham and salami, sliced cheese, olives, veggies and hummus. \u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were expecting me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and sat in the chair. \u201cWalt, it\u2019s my dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh, I wouldn\u2019t want to take your dinner....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sliced up twice as much, in case you came for your cup of sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t cook? At all? You eat like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling this isn\u2019t going to hold you for long,\u201d she said, picking up a celery stick and dipping it through the hummus. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll be all right. You can make yourself a pot roast or something when you get home tonight.\u201d</p><p>And he thought\u2014if we begin to keep company, I will have to be in charge of the food.</p><p>And she thought\u2014if we see much of each other, I\u2019ll probably gain weight.</p><p>\u201cFrom the outside, this looks like a bunkhouse or guesthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. Or is. First it was an artist\u2019s studio for the rancher\u2019s wife,\u201d she said, pointing up to two skylights in the ceiling. \u201cThen a bunkhouse for hands or lumberjacks. The kitchen and bathroom facilities were an afterthought, I believe. My Realtor had the junk hauled out, then I did some painting. I\u2019ll stay here while I work on the big house. And if you have to relieve yourself, the bathroom in the big house works just fine. The door closes and everything.\u201d She took a small sip of wine. \u201cHmm,\u201d she said, letting her eyes close briefly. Then she clinked his glass. \u201cTo new neighborhoods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t exactly what I expected of a movie star. Spackling. Living in one room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow interesting,\u201d she said, leaning back in her chair. \u201cYou\u2019re exactly what I expected of a general.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shot up. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Thinking anyone who isn\u2019t carrying an M16 is a wimp and women who dress up can\u2019t do heavy work. Walt, time for you to get with it. Movie stars are people. Most of them, anyway. And besides, I\u2019m not a movie star now\u2014I\u2019m retired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that like, being a movie star?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing a star, as you put it, is like living an imaginary life. Acting, however, is the hardest work you\u2019ll ever find. Look at me,\u201d she said, connecting with his eyes. \u201cClosely, closely\u2014yes, like that. Now look angry.\u201d He scowled for her. \u201cVery nice,\u201d she said. \u201cNow\u2014look vulnerable.\u201d He frowned in confusion. \u201cNot easy, is it? Add to that, you have to memorize one hundred and twenty pages of dialogue, be on the set at 6:00 a.m. and won\u2019t get done before 10:00 p.m., you\u2019ll either sweat or freeze, you\u2019ll stand at attention for so many goddamn hours your hips will lock and the man you have to kiss will have breath that would gag a maggot or the promising young actress who\u2019s playing your daughter will be a snotty little shit who holds up the whole production and costs everyone time and money.\u201d She leaned back and grinned at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. I swear to God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no wonder you retired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you retire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver thirty-five years is a long time for an Army officer,\u201d he began.</p><p>And they talked through a bottle of wine and her snacks. Walt learned a little about the life of an actress and Muriel heard about the Army and Walt\u2019s family, including the death of his son-in-law, the new grandson and Paul. Before long the wine was gone and it was almost ten o\u2019clock. There was no kiss good-night or anything even close, but Walt said, \u201cIf I had time on my hands, could you use help with painting and such?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never turn down a helping hand,\u201d she said. \u201cBut are you any good at it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPassable. I admit, I hired tradesmen to get it done at my place, but only because I was still in D.C. and wanted the place ready when I retired. I don\u2019t want to intrude in case you\u2019re training your dog or running errands. Why don\u2019t I call ahead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would work,\u201d Muriel said. She went to the counter of her little makeshift kitchen and wrote down her number. \u201cOr, you can always just come for your sugar.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cThanks for the wine. Very nice wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have plenty of wine,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have plenty of sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in business.\u201d</p><p>After a weekend in Virgin River, Vanni and Paul returned to Grants Pass. On Tuesday morning, Paul called Terri.</p><p>\u201cHi, Terri, it\u2019s Paul. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, Paul. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, thanks. I\u2019ve been out of town and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d she said tiredly. \u201cVirgin River again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact. I have a couple of potential building contracts down there and I\u2019ve been crunching some numbers to see if it\u2019s doable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig surprise,\u201d she said with an unhappy laugh. \u201cKind of a strange place to go when you have a child coming you claim to want to be involved with, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth these jobs will be complete by the time you deliver. And it\u2019s not far\u2014I can get to Grants Pass when I need to. Listen, I wanted to do this in person, but there\u2019s no point in blindsiding you\u2014I\u2019ll be getting married fairly soon.\u201d</p><p>He heard a sound; he wasn\u2019t sure if it was a snort or a laugh.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Paul said. \u201cShe knows all about my situation with you. She also has a child and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, cutting him off. \u201cYour best friend\u2019s baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe understands we\u2019ll be sharing custody and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I like that idea so much,\u201d she said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cWell, we have to deal with what we have,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd speaking of that, I\u2019ve been looking at the calendar. It has to be time for that doctor\u2019s appointment by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat appointment?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe one with the OB-GYN. The one I\u2019m going to with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that. I had my appointment last Friday. Everything seems to be fine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took a breath. \u201cYou know I wanted to go with you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSorry\u2014they called with an opening. And you didn\u2019t seem to be in town,\u201d she answered crisply.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d known there was an appointment, I would have been there.\u201d Anger began to swell up inside him and he cautioned himself to stay cool. He didn\u2019t want to set her off, though he wasn\u2019t sure what more she could do to screw up his head.</p> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said. \u201cYou seem to have more important things on your mind\u2014I don\u2019t even hear from you once a week...\u201d</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cCan you get away for lunch today?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She was quiet for a moment. \u201cPaul\u2014forget it, huh? You don\u2019t have to meet me for lunch or for anything else. Clearly there\u2019s nothing between us. You\u2019re getting married\u2014go have your life. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one thing between us. According to you.\u201d</p><p>She hung up the phone.</p> <p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d he said, slamming down the phone.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Vanni said, standing in the bedroom doorway with Mattie against her shoulder.</p><p>One hand braced on the desk, he hung his head. \u201cShe\u2019s got me over a nice little barrel here,\u201d he said, lifting his head and looking at her. \u201cShe just gave me my out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that made you real happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It didn\u2019t.\u201d He flipped through his calendar. He found the name of the doctor that he\u2019d jotted down, then pulled out the phone book. He couldn\u2019t find Dr. Charlene Weir listed anywhere. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s up to.\u201d</p><p>Vanni walked toward him. \u201cWhat was your out?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cShe told me to go have my life\u2014she\u2019d be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what kind of problem that is for me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be happy having a child of yours floating around out there, without knowing you, without your support and protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t.\u201d He dropped an arm around her shoulders, kissed Mattie\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to put you through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, Paul. Just resolve this to your satisfaction\u2014I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later he found himself in probably the most unlikely spot in Grants Pass\u2014the office of Dr. Cameron Michaels.</p><p>Of course Cameron fit him in, probably hopeful that his visit had something to do with Vanessa. Something that could benefit the good doctor. When Paul explained himself and what he needed, Cameron couldn\u2019t keep from laughing outright.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you find this hilarious,\u201d Paul said grimly. \u201cBut the fact is, I don\u2019t have many places to go for a little assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to hand it to you, Paul. You\u2019re not as clumsy around women as you think. For an unlucky son of a bitch, you sure land on your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got this mess to straighten out and Vanni still wants you. Damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop grinning. This isn\u2019t easy for Vanessa. But if it\u2019s mine, I want to take care of it. I have to. If I\u2019m going to be a father, I\u2019m going to be a decent father.\u201d</p><p>Cameron shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t mean to, but you stumbled into the right place. I\u2019d love to tell you there\u2019s nothing I can do to help you out of this mess\u2014but I\u2019m a children\u2019s doctor. And it isn\u2019t easy to deal with the number of babies who come into this world with parents who don\u2019t give a shit, don\u2019t even want them. At least you do. I\u2019ll hook you up for an ultrasound, which might give you some answers, if you can get her cooperation. You can follow through with a court order for an amniocentesis if you need one to check DNA and confirm paternity. Not for you, not even for her. For this baby she\u2019s carrying.\u201d He flipped through his BlackBerry. \u201cThen you can tell her, if she needs a good pediatrician, you know one.\u201d</p><p>Paul went from Cameron\u2019s office to the law firm at which Terri Bradford worked. For the first time he considered the fact that she worked for an attorney. She would know he had legal rights.</p><p>Terri was clearly surprised to see him. When she looked up from her desk, her eyes were wide and her expression completely baffled. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk. Right now. Today. Have you eaten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I don\u2019t want to talk. You\u2019re getting married\u2014you\u2019ll be far too busy to think about me. It\u2019s time for you to walk away from this, leave me alone.\u201d When she stood up from her desk, he noticed the tiniest rounding of her middle and he tried to judge whether it was approximately three months or if maybe she\u2019d just gained a little weight. Her breasts were definitely larger, straining at her blouse.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better talk to me, Terri,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cI\u2019m not going away and if I have to, I\u2019ll get help. Legal help.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over her desk, whispering, \u201cWhat am I supposed to tell my boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him it\u2019s a family emergency. Because it is.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, shook her head and went into her boss\u2019s office. She came right back and fished her purse out of the bottom drawer of her desk. As she walked toward the door, he grabbed her elbow with a soft hand, escorting her. She was small\u2014much shorter than Vanni. Her shoulder-length dark hair was shiny and her blue eyes large, surrounded by tons of thick lashes. There was every reason in the world to be attracted to someone like Terri. He noticed her body had changed with her pregnancy; she was fuller, rounder\u2014she definitely hadn\u2019t been lying about the fact she was pregnant. The thing missing was that glow a woman carrying seemed to have\u2014but that could be explained by her lack of a partner with whom to bring this baby into the world.</p><p>They weren\u2019t even to the parking lot before she stopped walking, turned her eyes up to his and said, \u201cYou can let this go. It\u2019s not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? How do I know for sure?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does it matter? I\u2019m not holding you responsible for anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m holding me responsible.\u201d He looked around. Across the street was a small park. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, leading her there. There was a bench under a big tree and not too many people around. \u201cSit down,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get this straightened out once and for all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what your problem is,\u201d she said, sitting down, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do. I can\u2019t be sure which lie is the truth and which truth is the lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if there\u2019s any chance you\u2019re carrying my child, I want to be its father. Is that too crazy for you to understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though you want nothing to do with the mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, either. It\u2019s not like that. If you\u2019re the mother of my child, that comes with respect and support. I wouldn\u2019t ignore your needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And how does the woman you plan to marry feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d expect nothing less.\u201d</p><p>Terri laughed. \u201cJesus. Aren\u2019t you all just so goddamn decent.\u201d</p><p>He nearly flinched. \u201cI need to be sure. I\u2019m not walking away from this without some confirmation. I\u2019m not going to miss out on any time with a child that\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was close enough. I didn\u2019t have anyone and you and I\u2014I thought we worked pretty well. I thought I could pull it off, all right? You caught me. I knew I was pregnant before that night with you. I was thinking of ending it, the pregnancy, but I didn\u2019t want to. I\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes. I\u2019m not going to let this be one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you prove this to me with an ultrasound that shows you are further along than three months?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d she groaned. \u201cI don\u2019t have to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re going to have to. I\u2019ll hire a lawyer. I\u2019ll sue you for my paternal rights, and to get me off your back, you\u2019ll have to have a test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of test?\u201d she asked, shocked.</p><p>\u201cAmniocentesis. DNA.\u201d</p><p>She went a little pale. \u201cDoes that involve a needle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it sure does. Unless we can get some easier answers from an ultrasound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have another doctor\u2019s appointment for three weeks. Maybe I can convince her to do an ultra\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said your doctor was Charlene Weir. Who, by the way, isn\u2019t in the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you remembered that?\u201d She laughed. \u201cCharlene Weir is my girlfriend. I just tossed it out there. I didn\u2019t want you going to the doctor with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not waiting three weeks, Terri. I have a place to take you for an ultrasound today. Will you go? Or do I have to hire a lawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you waste money on something like that?\u201d she asked, perplexed.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a waste. I have to know for certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your fianc\u00e9e making you do this?\u201d</p><p>He stood up. \u201cNot at all.\u201d He held out a hand to her. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, put her hand in his and let him draw her to her feet. He drove her to the offices of Mary Jensen, M.D. They filled out a lot of paperwork, Paul put his credit card on the visit and a very kind and gentle woman doctor fired up the ultrasound. Since Dr. Jensen, a friend of Cameron\u2019s, knew the purpose of the visit, there wasn\u2019t much talking in the room. It took only moments for the doctor to establish that the pregnancy was closer to four months than three, perhaps a few weeks advanced of Paul\u2019s contact with Terri.</p><p>But something happened to Paul as he watched the life inside her, moving around, kicking and squirming. For a big tough guy, things like this were his undoing. Pregnant women were beautiful to him; he hadn\u2019t been great with women but he\u2019d always wanted a wife, a family. Knowing that baby wasn\u2019t his didn\u2019t really give him the relief he expected. Had it been established that the baby was his it wouldn\u2019t exactly have made him proud, either\u2014he\u2019d been trying to keep Terri safe from that complication. He was ambivalent. And he felt a deep sadness for Terri, who despite all her attempts to mislead him, was in a very difficult position. He had sad feelings for the baby, who would not have the love and protection he could offer as a father. The urge to keep the vulnerable safe, to protect the weak with his strength, was natural for Paul.</p><p>Terri said nothing at all. She walked ahead of him out of the doctor\u2019s office and jumped in the truck. As Paul got in and started the engine, she looked into her lap, silent. There, she seemed to be saying without words. Done. Over.</p><p>He was also quiet as he drove her back to her office. When he got to the law firm\u2019s parking lot, however, he didn\u2019t turn in. He drove around the block and, instead, pulled into that same little park they\u2019d visited earlier. He got out of the truck, went to her side and opened the door for her. He put out his hand. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk a minute,\u201d he said softly, gently.</p><p>\u201cPaul,\u201d she said, tears brimming in her eyes. \u201cPlease. Enough. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Come on,\u201d he said, pulling her out of the truck. He dropped an affectionate arm around her shoulders and led her back to the bench, and as he did so she leaned against him and began to softly cry. \u201cSit down, Terri,\u201d he invited her. \u201cTell me something. Does the baby have a father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d she wept, digging around in her purse for a tissue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulled a clean handkerchief from his pocket and handed it to her. \u201cI mean, a man who is standing by. Supporting you. Ready to take his share of responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Fraid not,\u201d she said, accepting the hankie and dabbing her eyes.</p><p>He ran the back of his finger along her cheek, wiping away a tear. \u201cIs that why you told me it was mine?\u201d</p><p>She turned liquid eyes up to him. \u201cPartly,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it than that....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas it about money?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She laughed without humor. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was because neither of us had anyone in our lives\u2014at least that\u2019s what you said. It was because of the way you are\u2014telling me that story about how you were with your best friend\u2019s wife when her baby came, and it tore you up but it was the most beautiful thing you\u2019d ever seen. It was the way I felt when I was with you.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be a good father. A good...Never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t together very much,\u201d Paul said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI know. It was stupid. But I thought if you grew to love me...\u201d She leaned against him and let the tears flow. \u201cIf you thought I was having your baby, maybe we\u2019d be together more. And if we were together, maybe...\u201d She wiped at her eyes. \u201cI thought I\u2019d...I thought we\u2019d be safe with you. I felt a lot more for you than you did for me. But what I did...It was wrong. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He put an arm around her and held her. \u201cTerri\u2014you had to know I\u2019d find out eventually...\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged and sniffed. \u201cMaybe not. At least not until we\u2019d had some time together. And if you got attached, if there were more children...It was a stupid risk, I really don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have been able to go through with it.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019m not a dishonest person. I probably would have told you the truth before...\u201d She took a breath. \u201cIt took me a while to accept that you just weren\u2019t into me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t call, you left town all the time. You were right\u2014there wasn\u2019t much between us. But that didn\u2019t keep me from wishing there was.\u201d</p><p>He put a large hand over her barely swollen middle. \u201cAnd this little one\u2019s father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot interested, either,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him. He could care less. He told me I\u2019d have to sue him to\u2014Well, it didn\u2019t take me long to decide I was better off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoser,\u201d Paul muttered under his breath. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been bad about those pills. Missing them, forgetting. And he didn\u2019t use anything. It\u2019s my screwup. All mine. I\u2019m pretty lucky a baby is all I got from him.\u201d Her eyes were large and round. \u201cThe condom didn\u2019t fail, Paul, and I was tested at my first appointment. I didn\u2019t give you anything.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t share that he already knew that. Acting on Jack\u2019s advice, he\u2019d been checked out. \u201cAre you going to be all right?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage,\u201d she said, wiping her tears away.</p><p>He lifted her chin. \u201cIs there anything I can do to help you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re off the hook, Paul. You don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still have that card I gave you? With the phone numbers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can find me easily. I work for a family company headquartered in Grants Pass. My family. If I\u2019m not here, they can reach me. If you ever need anything...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPaul,\u201d she said, laughing through tears. \u201cI lied to you. You don\u2019t have to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerri,\u201d he said sweetly. \u201cIt\u2019s true we\u2019re not a couple. That we never were. But I don\u2019t go to bed with women I don\u2019t have any feelings for. God, I\u2019m not that bad. Even if we weren\u2019t in love, I thought of us as friends, at least. We had a real important connection. You were good to me. I tried to be good to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re incredible...After what I tried to do to you!\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cI was wrong to call you when I got back to Grants Pass. It set up a series of events that were unfair to you. But I remember it so damn well\u2014I was in a lot of pain. It was a bad, bad time for me. That night, I was a pretty miserable, desperate guy and you got me through a rough spot. You were kind to me. Sympathetic and sweet. Loving. At the time, I was very grateful. I wouldn\u2019t be a gentleman if I didn\u2019t tell you that.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against him, the tears dry now, and he put his arms around her in comfort. She sighed. \u201cI thought I loved you, that I could make you happy if I had a chance,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie about that.\u201d She lifted her head and looked up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re an easy man to fall for.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his arms a bit. He knew something about love now. It filled him up inside, made him feel like the luckiest man on the planet to have Vanessa. He would do anything for her, and if she had come to him with another man\u2019s baby and asked him to take her with that burden inside her, he wouldn\u2019t even have to think about it.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Terri said with a sad little laugh. \u201cI need to find a man like you. Then I\u2019ll be set.\u201d</p><p>He sat with her for a long while, his arms around her, giving what small comfort he could. He dropped a tender kiss on the top of her head. \u201cYou\u2019ll find the right man,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be a good mother. This will work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, I\u2019m sorry if I hurt you, if I complicated your life. It was so selfish of me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get past that, no problem. Desperate times sometimes bring out desperate measures\u2014I\u2019m not angry. And I know a really good pediatrician, if you\u2019re looking for one...\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>V anessa had just finished nursing the baby when the doorbell at Paul\u2019s house rang. Holding the baby, she went and glanced out the window beside the door. There stood Carol, looking every bit the chic and sophisticated businesswoman she always did. Vanni opened the door somewhat reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d be here,\u201d Carol said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to call. I wanted to see you and I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d agree.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa opened the door. \u201cI haven\u2019t been in touch, Carol, because I thought we could use some time to think things through. Both of us.\u201d Vanni held the door open. \u201cCome in, since you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Paul at home?\u201d she asked, stepping across the threshold.</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment.\u201d She looked at her watch. \u201cI guess he should be coming soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Vanessa,\u201d Carol said uncomfortably. \u201cLance is furious with me. Terrified we won\u2019t see much of the baby because of what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in and sit down,\u201d Vanni said, leading the way to the dining room. She put Mattie in his bouncy seat on the table and pulled out a chair. \u201cSo,\u201d she said bravely. \u201cLance didn\u2019t like that little meeting you tried to arrange?\u201d</p><p>Carol was caught looking around at Paul\u2019s house. By the rather surprised expression on her face, maybe she wasn\u2019t expecting anything quite so beautiful, so tasteful. Maybe she thought Paul made his home in a construction trailer?</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d Vanni asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNot from the beginning. He blustered about it, but I didn\u2019t think I was doing anything harmful. You know we care about Paul for many reasons, but after getting to know Cameron, I just thought the world of him. And...Oh hell,\u201d Carol said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about you and Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why you should make it a policy to ask if your plans are acceptable. Had you asked me in the first place if I\u2019d like you to invite a single man to dinner, I would have asked you to wait on that. I was missing Paul, wanting to see him. Cameron\u2019s a great guy, but I\u2019m not interested in him romantically,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cIn the end, both men were hurt. You have to stop doing things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always think I\u2019m helping,\u201d she said. \u201cI always feel like I have the perfect solution. Really\u2014I wouldn\u2019t...\u201d Her voice trailed off. \u201cYou and Paul...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019re getting married. I love him. He\u2019ll be a wonderful father to Mattie. You can\u2019t imagine how much he adores this baby. How grateful he is that there\u2019s a little piece left of his best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re happy?\u201d Carol asked, her brow furrowed. \u201cThis is what you want?\u201d</p><p>Vanni reached out a hand to touch Carol\u2019s. \u201cWhen we lost Matt, the pain was so great for both me and Paul\u2014for everyone\u2014I didn\u2019t know if I could ever be happy again. I imagine there were times you felt the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I miss him so much,\u201d she said, and her eyes glistened. She reached for the baby. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Carol picked up the baby and held him against her, her eyes wet. \u201cYou have no idea how fast the time goes, and how much goes with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Matt had that videoconference before his death, Paul was at the house. God, Matt was so happy to see his face, to talk to him. I think he was as happy to see Paul as me. Carol, this would make Matt happy.\u201d</p><p>Carol laughed through some tears. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true. Matt and Paul always spent more time at the Haggerty house than ours. A whole crowd of messy boys with big smelly feet never threw Marianne. She somehow knew just what food to toss at them. Our house was too sterile. I was strict about neatness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess if you have three of them, one more hardly matters,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cThey were just boys,\u201d Carol said. \u201cWho can blame them. They weren\u2019t interested in how hard I had to work to buy a certain lamp or how much trouble it was to keep up the landscaping. Before the Haggertys built that big house, while the boys were young, they could barely keep grass in the yard.\u201d She smiled a bit forlornly. \u201cAll the boys played soccer.\u201d</p><p>Whew, Vanni thought. It wasn\u2019t just that Carol thought Cameron was a better choice for her. She didn\u2019t want to compete with Marianne and her mother-earth qualities. \u201cI suppose Marianne always had cookies when they got home from school, too,\u201d Vanni said, testing out her theory.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. A trampoline, drum set, all kinds of stuff. They let the boys set up a kind of band in the garage\u2014electric piano, guitars, the whole bit. Noisy enough to split your skull.\u201d She laughed a little. \u201cNot one of them had a lick of talent, thank God. Or else they\u2019d all be tattooed rock stars.\u201d</p><p>With his usual fabulous timing, little Mattie barfed curdled milk right down Carol\u2019s back and predictably she said, \u201cEwww.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d Vanni shot to her feet, a diaper she used as a burping cloth in her hand. She reached for the baby.</p><p>\u201cNo, please don\u2019t take him,\u201d Carol said. \u201cJust put that over my shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol, it\u2019s silk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh the hell with it. There are dry cleaners, you know.\u201d</p><p>Vanni wiped her off as well as she could, then draped a clean diaper over Carol\u2019s shoulder. She was pretty stunned that Carol didn\u2019t fling the baby away from her, but she held him close, snuggled him.</p><p>Vanni chewed her lip for a second. Carol\u2019s afraid of another generation that belonged to her by blood preferring the Haggerty family. Because she\u2019s rigid, not warm and fuzzy, and she knows it. Then Vanni said, \u201cEach one of those Haggerty men turned out to be successful and hardworking. Someone in that house must have insisted on study.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cProbably Stan. He\u2019s always been business-minded.\u201d She cuddled and kissed the baby. She seemed to have already forgotten about the wet patch running down her back. Facing the thought of being separated from her only grandson had created a shift in Carol. Maybe not a total personality change, but definitely a small conversion.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to talk to you about,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cIt\u2019s early, I know, but Paul and I, when Mattie\u2019s a little older\u2014we want more children. I really want more children. I\u2019d like it if you welcomed them as much as little Matt. Along with us, of course. I know Mattie\u2019s special, your biological grandson, but it would be so nice if we could count on you and Lance to open your hearts to any of his siblings.\u201d Carol raised startled eyes to Vanni\u2019s face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I certainly don\u2019t expect you to turn your beautiful home into a clubhouse. I don\u2019t intend to live that way, no matter how many boys come along. But of course, there could even be girls. I hope so\u2014you\u2019d be perfect for little girls...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean that, Vanessa?\u201d Carol asked, her eyes a bit wide.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be boundaries,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cYou have to check with me before you make any plans that affect me, my son, my life, my relationship, my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you get any little granddaughters\u2019 ears pierced without my permission, you\u2019ll pay,\u201d Vanessa said, lifting one brow meaningfully.</p><p>\u201cOh heavens, of course I wouldn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d better show Paul the gratitude he deserves\u2014he\u2019s still a wonderful friend to Matt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I said that,\u201d Carol said. \u201cThinking a doctor would be better for my grandson...\u201d</p><p>Vanni surprised herself with a laugh. \u201cI guess you\u2019re not the first mother or grandmother to try to hook up your loved ones with someone as prestigious as a doctor. And Cameron is wonderful\u2014smart, sensitive, kind. What I\u2019d like you to see is that Paul is at least his equal. And that you have a great gift in Paul as Mattie\u2019s stepfather\u2014because Paul will do everything to keep Matt alive for him. Paul was so loyal to Matt, so committed. That\u2019s something no other man can give us, Carol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I can see that. Are you still angry with me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Vanni shook her head. \u201cYou should make amends with Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he furious?\u201d Carol asked, snuggling the baby close.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t said a word. But still\u2014he deserves much better than he got. Long before I fell in love with him, he was wonderful to me, to your grandson. You should apologize.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, though I dread it,\u201d she said. And as if planned, the door from the garage to the kitchen opened and Paul came in.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is a surprise,\u201d he said when he saw Carol. He went first to Vanni, dropping a kiss on her forehead and again, that possessive hand on her shoulder. \u201cHow are you, Carol?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cRepentant,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Paul. I didn\u2019t realize what was happening.\u201d</p><p>Paul gave Vanni\u2019s shoulder a reassuring squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s behind us, Carol. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s decent of you under the circumstances. Any chance I can squeak in another attempt at dinner before you leave town again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that isn\u2019t going to work out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have plans and I\u2019d rather not cancel them. But we\u2019ll be back next week and try again then. Of course you\u2019re always welcome in Virgin River\u2014you know the general would make you welcome anytime.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa frowned, not knowing they had any plans before leaving town. She wondered if maybe Paul was more angry than he\u2019d allowed to show.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to live with that,\u201d Carol said, jostling the baby close to her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to leave you women to your visit. I need a shower,\u201d he said, heading for the master bedroom.</p><p>After about twenty minutes, Vanni felt for the first time since she met Carol that they had reached an understanding. Pleading the need to get ready to go out\u2014a complete lie\u2014Vanessa escorted Carol out the door. She then carried the baby with her to the bedroom and put him in the port-a-crib. The shower had stopped and she stepped into the master bath. Paul had a towel around his waist and was brushing his teeth. When he saw her he gave a spit and a rinse, wiping his mouth on another towel.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cDepends on your perspective. And how did you get to know me so well, so fast?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been with you forever. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not mine. The baby. She\u2019s closer to four months than three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know this for certain?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe had an ultrasound. Your friend Cameron made arrangements for me. And he found the situation very humorous, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she said, taking that in. \u201cDid he hope you\u2019d learn it was your baby and I\u2019d toss you by the side of the road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Cameron\u2019s actually a much more decent guy than that. He has a real soft spot for responsible parents. He didn\u2019t do it for either of us, but for the baby in question. A child deserves parents who care.\u201d He opened his arms. \u201cCome here. Press yourself against me.\u201d</p><p>She walked into his arms.</p><p>\u201cIt was very sad,\u201d he said, holding her close. \u201cShe was sorry, of course. I forced the issue of the ultrasound for positive proof even after she swore up and down it wasn\u2019t mine. I threatened with legal action. I had to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem relieved,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I am. It wouldn\u2019t have been easy to be a halfway-decent father, not being partnered with the mother. But the fact is, she isn\u2019t going to have any father for that baby. I don\u2019t know her very well, so I don\u2019t know much about her friends and family, about what kind of support she\u2019ll have. But I know she doesn\u2019t have a man in her life. That has to be hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Vanni said, a fact she knew only too well. \u201cMaybe she\u2019ll get lucky like me, and one will come to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. There\u2019s no question\u2014she stands a better chance of having that in her future without me in the mix.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cI can\u2019t ever love anyone but you. I\u2019m all in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you felt sorry for her. Even after she tried to trick you,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he admitted, holding her, tightening his embrace.</p><p>\u201cOut here, you\u2019re all muscle, a hide like leather,\u201d she said, running her hands over his upper arms, shoulders and chest. \u201cYou have a soft underbelly. You\u2019re a soft touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Mush. Nothing but mush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what I\u2019ll do for you,\u201d she said, looking up at him. \u201cWhen Mattie\u2019s a little older, I\u2019ll have this IUD removed. We\u2019ll get you started on your own small herd.\u201d</p><p>That made him smile. \u201cThat would be nice, Vanni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be all right? No regrets now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne regret,\u201d he said, looking down into her eyes. \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t told your father about it.\u201d She laughed at him. \u201cNow he\u2019s got that on me forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he tripped you up. I told you\u2014he\u2019s very good. Tom and I learned early not to try to slip anything by him. Welcome to the family.\u201d She grinned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to try to have dinner with Carol and Lance while we\u2019re still in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve it or not, I\u2019m dead tired. I\u2019d rather spend all day on a roof in the hot sun than do the kind of business I did today. It wore me down. I feel better now, after a shower\u2014if you\u2019d like to go over there, we can call her, tell her we had a change of plans. Just say the word.\u201d</p><p>Vanni thought briefly about explaining to Paul that she and Carol had turned a corner, that much of Carol\u2019s attitude had to do with being afraid she might lose another generation of her offspring to Paul\u2019s nurturing and homespun mom. Maybe someday, she thought. For now it would be enough to give Carol a chance to demonstrate she could stop controlling everything.</p><p>\u201cNo. I think it might be a good idea if Carol begins to understand she\u2019s not in charge of everyone\u2019s life. We\u2019ll catch up with her early next week.\u201d She smiled. \u201cIt isn\u2019t likely I\u2019ll ever pass up a night alone with you. Except,\u201d she said, hearing a little fussing from the bedroom, \u201cI do have another man in my life, and I think he\u2019s drenched.\u201d</p><p>Paul and Vanni were back in Virgin River Friday night for another weekend. Paul and Walt turned some hamburgers on the grill and Walt seemed especially jovial. For the first time in such a long time, Vanni asked herself if her dad was ever lonely. It had probably been a long, quiet week\u2014she and Paul out of town and Tom spending every second with Brenda\u2014and it seemed as though Walt was relieved to have them home.</p><p>After the dinner dishes were done, Vanni went to settle the baby in bed. Paul found the TV on in the great room, but Walt was out on the deck with a cup of coffee. Paul stuck his head out the back door and said, \u201cSir, if you can spare a few minutes from that sunset, I\u2019d sure like to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>Walt turned. \u201cBy all means.\u201d He threw an arm wide and indicated Paul should precede him to the great room. Walt clicked the TV off and chose the chair facing Paul. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, son?\u201d</p><p>Paul scooted forward a bit. \u201cWell, it\u2019s no secret I\u2019m in love with your daughter. I want to marry Vanni. Do I have your blessing? Your permission?\u201d</p><p>Walt shook his head and chuckled. \u201cHaggerty, you sneak down the hall after I\u2019m in bed every night\u2014you\u2019d damn sure better marry her. In fact, it might make sense for you to put the baby in that bedroom you\u2019re not using\u2014save a trip or two, let the child have some space...\u201d</p><p>Paul felt a stain creep to his cheeks and thought, I\u2019m over thirty-five\u2014how the hell does this man make me blush? \u201cYes, sir. Good idea, sir. Thing is\u2014we\u2019ve been talking...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about that little mess up in Grants Pass?\u201d Walt asked.</p><p>Paul scooted forward a little more, surprised. \u201cVanni didn\u2019t tell you? A misunderstanding, sir.\u201d</p><p>Walt let go a laugh. \u201cThat must\u2019ve made your day.\u201d</p><p>Paul hung his head briefly. \u201cActually, it\u2019s a sad situation and I regret that I...Well, I\u2019m relieved Vanni doesn\u2019t have to deal with it.\u201d Right then Vanni came back to the great room. She went to Paul and sat on his lap. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about getting the wedding done the weekend before Tom leaves. It\u2019s quick, but neither of us wants anything flashy\u2014just a simple ceremony with friends.\u201d He squeezed Vanni. \u201cWe\u2019re anxious to make it legal, and we want Tom with us for that. Do you have any objection to that idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize that\u2019s only three weeks away?\u201d Walt said. \u201cThink you can do it that fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do, Dad,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked out some of the details. We\u2019d do it right here, if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your family, Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we can count on them, sir. In fact, there\u2019s another thing regarding my family\u2014my dad and brothers support the idea of starting a Haggerty Construction division here, serving the towns around here. I think there might be enough work to keep me busy\u2014and if that\u2019s the case, we can make our home in Virgin River permanently. Of course, I won\u2019t know till I try\u2014but while I\u2019m looking for building contracts, I have the Middleton and Valenzuela jobs to keep me going.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd if there isn\u2019t work here?\u201d Walt asked.</p><p>\u201cThere will be,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut until it\u2019s established, I\u2019ll keep the house in Grants Pass. If I have to, there\u2019s always a lot of work for me there. But, General, people have such a hard time finding a contractor around here, I have a feeling there will be too much work, once my name gets out. We have a good reputation in Grants Pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said. \u201cJust how many houses can you build at one time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten pretty big in Oregon,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten up to a dozen or two structures in progress at a time, depending on the size, whether they\u2019re commercial, family units or multifamily\u2014apartments. Our specialty has been custom homes from the beginning\u2014I don\u2019t know how much of that I\u2019ll find around here. But there\u2019s lots of renovation work. How long did it take you to renovate this house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost two years,\u201d Walt said.</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s it\u2014we could\u2019ve had it done in a few months, even if we started with a lean-to. Six at the most. I sense a serious market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you make a living on a few a year? Renovations or custom homes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA damn fine living,\u201d Paul confirmed.</p> <p>Walt hmmed again. \u201cGive me a second.\u201d He left the room and Vanni and Paul exchanged confused glances. Then Walt was back. He held a thick, folded document. \u201cThis was impetuous of me, and if it doesn\u2019t appeal to you, there will be no hard feelings. But then again, if you like the idea, you can consider it an early wedding gift.\u201d He handed the pages to Paul.</p><p>Paul unfolded the document. At the top was printed, in boldface, DEED.</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of land here. I wanted a lot\u2014in case the surrounding acreage sells off at some point. I need space to ride. I thought a couple of acres on the other side of the stable might work out for you. If you\u2019re interested, that is. If you\u2019d rather scout around for your own land...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy,\u201d Vanni said, so deeply moved that her hand rose to her throat and her eyes swelled with tears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to belong to you and Tom one day anyway. I have Shelby taken care of. If you\u2019re inclined and want to keep your own horses, we can always enlarge the stable and corral.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI know a builder.\u201d</p><p>Gently, Paul pushed Vanni off his lap and stood, facing Walt. \u201cThis is very generous, sir,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very selfish, Paul. I wouldn\u2019t mind having my daughter and grandchildren nearby. Frankly, a year ago I didn\u2019t think that was an option.\u201d Then he looked at Vanni and asked, \u201cHoney, can you be happy in a little town like this? Your husband building around the area, nothing much to occupy you but children and horses?\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little emotionally. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right? Dad, not many people even have the opportunity for this kind of life. The only complication is whether there\u2019s enough work here for Paul.\u201d She reached for his hand. \u201cHe loves building houses. And he\u2019s brilliant at it. We have to keep him at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s the thing, Vanni,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBefore approaching my dad and brothers with this idea, I called around. I said I had house plans and needed a company to build\u2014the soonest I could get someone was a year. There\u2019s plenty of work if they\u2019re backed up a year, plenty to spare.\u201d He looked at Walt. \u201cI\u2019d be willing to call Joe Benson in the morning, tell him we\u2019re ready to discuss our own plans. If you\u2019re sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding it in your hand, son. It\u2019s your future wife\u2019s property. I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>W hen May arrived in Virgin River there was love in the air. Paul and Vanni had been back and forth to Grants Pass for a couple of weeks, unable to be apart for even a few days. Paul was working out a deal with Joe Benson and his family business to build Preacher\u2019s add-on, and Mike and Brie\u2019s house. Then there was Tom and Brenda\u2014young lovers, too hot to touch, getting ready to say goodbye for Tom to go to basic training and then to West Point. It was prom weekend and Vanni and Paul were back again to see the prom couple.</p><p>Mel Sheridan made it to May with that new baby girl still growing, and she was damn happy about that. One morning she woke up at 5:00 a.m., well before Jack. That almost never happened, especially when she was pregnant. But she was up and full of energy, so she started her day by making her husband a pot of coffee and began cleaning out the refrigerator. She would routinely bring home groceries and they would inevitably rot while they took their meals together at the bar, or packed up some of Preacher\u2019s delicious meals to take home.</p><p>Just getting rid of the old food wasn\u2019t quite good enough. Mel was on a roll, so she filled the sink with soapy water and began to scrub the inside of the fridge.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Jack asked as he wandered into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cleaning out the refrigerator,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop bringing food into this house\u2014we let too much go to waste.\u201d</p><p>She heard David start to stir and lifted her head like a doe smelling a hunter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get him,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHe\u2019s heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll get his breakfast ready. Would you like me to make you an omelet or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are the eggs?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, looking. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re deadly yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll pass, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoward.\u201d</p><p>David had his Cheerios, then his playtime in the great room with all his toys while Mel started the laundry and Jack went outside to spend a few minutes on his favorite morning activity of splitting logs. By next fall there would be a nice huge stack of firewood ready for the winter. Some of the trees that had been felled to widen the driveway were stacked at the tree line on their property, and he was working on turning them into fuel for the fireplace.</p><p>Mel wiped down the kitchen cabinets with lemon oil. Paul and Jack had truly outdone themselves on the kitchen with its gorgeous oak cabinets, black granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances. The house was absolutely magnificent, and much more than Mel had dared allow herself to expect. Compared to that little cabin she\u2019d lived in for almost two years, it was huge\u2014over three thousand square feet\u2014but she\u2019d managed to fill it up very quickly with furniture and accessories.</p><p>Once done with the cabinets, Mel did another laundry shuffle, then got a clean diaper for Davie. She followed that by getting to work on the shutters with the lemon oil. Then she busied herself with a special cleaner for the leather furniture, followed by one more load of laundry. When Jack checked in on her before lunch, she was pulling the tags off new little pink things that she\u2019d had for a long time\u2014gifts for the baby from Jack\u2019s sisters and her sister. Mel laundered and folded all these infant garments, something that probably should\u2019ve been done weeks ago.</p><p>Having babies barely a year apart creates a need for two nurseries\u2014she cleaned David\u2019s room and gave the new baby\u2019s room a little cleaning, too, putting away the clothes and getting out the newborn diapers and bath towels.</p><p>By afternoon Jack found her down on her hands and knees scouring the bathroom floor around the toilet and tub. \u201cFor the love of God,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing? If you want the bathroom cleaned, why don\u2019t you just tell me? I know how to clean a goddamn bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all that dirty, but since I\u2019m in the cleaning mood, I thought I\u2019d whip it into shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid is ready for his nap. Why don\u2019t you join him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel like a nap. I\u2019m going to vacuum the area rugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll do that if it has to be done right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mel said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been tricked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly by yourself, darling,\u201d she said, whirling away to get the Pledge and Windex. After that was done\u2014and there was a lot of wood and glass and stainless steel to occupy her\u2014she was sweeping off the porch and back steps. Not long after that, she was caught dragging the cradle into the master bedroom.</p><p>\u201cMelinda!\u201d he shouted, startling her and making her jump.</p><p>\u201cJack! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of that thing!\u201d He brushed her out of the way and grabbed the cradle. \u201cWhere do you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight there,\u201d she said. He put it beside the bed. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cOver there, kind of out of the way.\u201d He put it there. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cAgainst that wall\u2014we\u2019ll put it where we need it when she comes.\u201d He moved it again. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>The phone rang. \u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d he said. He picked up a pencil and put it in her face. \u201cIf you lift anything heavier than this, I\u2019m going to beat you.\u201d Then he turned and left the room.</p><p>He has cabin fever, she thought. Spending too much time at home with me, making sure I don\u2019t pick up anything heavier than a pencil. He should get out more, and out of my hair.</p><p>When Jack was done with the phone, she was on her knees in front of the hearth, brushing out the barely used fireplace. \u201cAw, Jesus Christ,\u201d he said in frustration. \u201cCan that not wait until at least frickin\u2019 winter?\u201d</p><p>She sat back on her heels. \u201cYou are really getting on my last nerve. Don\u2019t you have somewhere you can go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but we do. Go shower and get beautiful. Paul and Vanessa are back and after they view the prom couple, they\u2019re going to the bar for dinner. We\u2019ll all meet there, look at some pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in the mood for a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want, Melinda,\u201d he said tiredly. \u201cJust stop this frickin\u2019 cleaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not going to be able to do much of this after the baby comes, so it\u2019s good to have it all done. And the way I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been good at cleaning. Why couldn\u2019t you just cook?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t cook anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cook.\u201d She smiled. \u201cHow many cooks does one house need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go shower. You have fireplace ash on your nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain in the ass,\u201d she said to him, getting clumsily to her feet.</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d he said.</p><p>An hour later the three of them were on their way into town. \u201cSo, you did it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou got Paul down here staking out his territory. And now they\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should at least give me a little credit for trying to get a couple of people together instead of trying to keep them apart.\u201d Then more softly he added, \u201cLike I did Preacher and Paige, Brie and Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2014apparently it all worked out just fine...\u201d she said a little dreamily, rubbing her hands over her tummy.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel all right?\u201d he asked, glancing at her. \u201cYou\u2019re a little...pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel fantastic. Probably just the calm before the storm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do that again tomorrow and I\u2019m tying you down. You make me crazy sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack...\u201d She laughed. \u201cWhen did you get like this? You\u2019re so annoying!\u201d</p><p>By the time they got to the bar, Brie and Mike were there and of course Paige and Preacher and Christopher. Doc came in, but before he could get comfortable his pager went off. He made a phone call from the kitchen and headed out for a house call. Next, Vanessa, Paul and the baby, along with a bouncy baby seat, had all arrived. The crowd was treated to digital pictures of Tom and Brenda and another couple all dressed up in their fancy clothes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAw,\u201d Mel said, clicking through the pictures. \u201cLook at how gorgeous they are. Aren\u2019t they the cutest? Don\u2019t they look so in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo in love,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see my little brother like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the general?\u201d Mel asked.</p> <p>Vanni frowned and shook her head. \u201cHe said you see enough of him all week when we\u2019re in Grants Pass. He said he\u2019d stay home tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Mel questioned. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen much of him at all lately. In fact, I\u2019ve been wondering what he\u2019s been doing with himself. I assumed he\u2019d had Tom and Brenda for dinner every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d Vanni laughed. \u201cIf they can escape the parents, I believe they have important making out to do. Gotta cram in as much of that as possible before Tom leaves, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine so,\u201d Mel agreed.</p><p>The bar had few customers that evening, so Jack divided his time between the pushed-together tables and his favorite spot behind the bar. Paul drifted up to the bar and said, \u201cYou seem a little unhappy tonight. Is it because your wife is about to explode?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah, that\u2019s only part of it. We got a call from Rick a while ago. He\u2019s got ten days of leave coming up\u2014after which he goes to Iraq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, man. You doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHanging in there. I mean\u2014we went, right? It\u2019s just that Rick...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeels like a son\u2014and it\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, I guess.\u201d Jack had known all along that Rick wouldn\u2019t play it safe\u2014if he was going in, he\u2019d be part of the fight. \u201cAt least he\u2019ll be around for a while\u2014I\u2019ll see if some of the boys want to come up, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be four of us for sure,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHow\u2019s Mel doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s nesting,\u201d Jack said. \u201cShe\u2019s been after it all day. I\u2019ve heard her talk about her patients and their sudden burst of energy. I saw it today up close and personal. Any second, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, it\u2019ll be great. I\u2019d love to be here for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really getting into this baby business....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as far into it as I was,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAfter talking to Mel, I followed through, had an ultrasound with the woman and the baby\u2019s not mine.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with me, man. I\u2019m relieved, but almost sorry\u2014because there\u2019s a baby coming and no man to take care of them. It would almost be better if it had been mine. I\u2019m a sick SOB\u2014you should get more rational friends.\u201d</p><p>Jack leveled him with a serious look, a slight frown. \u201cI can think of twenty reasons why you don\u2019t get married if it\u2019s not the right match, but I can\u2019t think of one reason why you\u2019d walk away from your own kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offered to help her anyway,\u201d Paul said. Then he shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s a good person. This is gonna be tough on her.\u201d</p><p>Jack gave him a half smile. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me, Paul. She take you up on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Like I said, she\u2019s a decent person. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s going through this. Glad Vanni isn\u2019t going to have to put up with it, but sorry\u2014\u201d</p> <p>But Jack wasn\u2019t listening anymore. His narrowed eyes were on Mel. It was like he sensed it; smelled it. She got up from the table and was heading toward the bathroom back off the kitchen. She paused when she got to the end of the bar, gripped it to stabilize herself, made a noise that only her husband heard, bent slightly over her huge belly and let go with a gush of amniotic fluid that splashed to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Jack said, going to her at once.</p><p>Silence fell over the dinner crowd. Paul edged back to the table, sat down beside Vanessa and said, \u201cJack said she\u2019s been nesting all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it happening?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>Jack braced Mel from behind, his hands on her upper arms and asked, \u201cContraction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy howdy,\u201d she said, a little breathless.</p><p>\u201cBy the time you got to cleaning the bathroom this afternoon, you had completely given yourself away,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I suspected this would happen today. But I didn\u2019t want to get my hopes up. I don\u2019t think we have a whole lot of time to screw around. She\u2019s here, Jack.\u201d</p><p>He turned her around to face him. \u201cHave you been having contractions all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. A couple. A few.\u201d She inhaled deeply. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her immediately into his arms and started barking orders. \u201cSomeone bring Davie to the truck and ride home with us. Preach\u2014call John Stone and tell him it\u2019s now and it\u2019s gonna be quick.\u201d Then he carried Mel out the door to the truck.</p><p>Brie quickly picked up her nephew, the diaper bag, and followed. Preacher went to the kitchen to use the phone. Everyone waited tensely. When Preacher came back to the room he said, \u201cJohn\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p><p>More silence lingered. Then Mike said, \u201cWhat are we waiting for? Let\u2019s wipe up the floor, pack up some stuff and join the party.\u201d Everyone got busy cleaning up, gathering food, drink and even cigars to go to the Sheridan house to stand by for the birth.</p><p>Before Jack got Mel home, she was already having hard contractions, two minutes apart. \u201cBreathe,\u201d he was telling her. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about pushing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better be. I should\u2019ve known. I should\u2019ve kept you home. I should\u2019ve brought Doc along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLighten up, it\u2019s only a ten-minute drive. And Doc\u2019s on a call...Uhhhh,\u201d she added, bending over her belly.</p><p>\u201cAw, Melinda...Okay, baby. You just breathe, don\u2019t worry about a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d she rasped out.</p><p>When they got to the house, he lifted her out of the truck into his arms and smacked her head on the door frame in the process.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done this to me before!\u201d she accused.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve always been real smooth,\u201d he said, remembering a time long ago, before they were married, when he was carrying her home in much this same manner, though not pregnant, and while his mind was on sex, he damn near gave her a concussion, which sort of precluded any kind of sex. His mind was definitely not on sex right now.</p><p>Jack carried Mel to the bedroom while Brie took charge of David. Mel had already prepared the bed with a rubber mattress protector so all that was necessary was helping her to undress and climb in, which Jack did. He added a couple of soft, clean towels under her. Then he went for a flashlight from the kitchen and Brie shouted, \u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to see how close she is,\u201d Jack responded, moving quickly.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Brie said. \u201cWe need some professionals here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry Doc Mullins\u2019s pager. The number\u2019s inside the cupboard door. And get out a bottle,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a drink?\u201d she asked, appalled.</p><p>Not a bad idea, he thought. \u201cFor Davie. Get him ready for bed and give him his bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sure,\u201d she said, rattled.</p><p>Back in the bedroom he said, \u201cLet\u2019s have a look, honey.\u201d</p><p>Mel\u2019s knees came up and Jack clicked on the flashlight, shining it right on her pelvic floor. \u201cGood. I don\u2019t see anything yet.\u201d Then he looked over her knees. \u201cYou gonna wait for John this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith any luck,\u201d she answered breathlessly.</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cWhere\u2019s your bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll get it. I\u2019ll wash up. Pant.\u201d And he disappeared again.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop to chat with Brie as he ran through the house, but he noticed her eyes were round and a little scared as he passed her with Mel\u2019s medical bag. He was rushing around like a madman, getting clamps, scissors and suction out of her bag, spreading out towels and baby blankets at the foot of the bed. He shone the flashlight on her again and said, \u201cPant!\u201d Then he headed for the bathroom, rolled up his sleeves and began to scrub up to his elbows. He\u2019d been down this road before and he wasn\u2019t thrilled about doing it again. Doctors and midwives should deliver babies, not men who knew nothing about it. He\u2019d been lucky once, but there was no guarantee he\u2019d be lucky again. It took him ten minutes to get set up and washed, then he was back at her side, flashlight in hand. He gave a look. \u201cOh God,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s crowning,\u201d she confirmed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re incredible. How can you do this so fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the first idea. I\u2019m a breeder, Doc says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPant,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you push, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you get so pissy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I keep trying to avoid this part. All the rest of it, I\u2019m game. I hate doing this. I should\u2019ve had you tested or something\u2014to see why you just dump \u2019em like this, like there\u2019s nothing to it. Holy shit, Melinda\u2014what if I screw up? Huh? Have you thought of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she said weakly, \u201cyou aren\u2019t going to screw up.\u201d And then she was seized by another contraction.</p><p>He suddenly realized he was thinking only of himself and he got down on one knee beside the bed, took her hand in both of his and said, \u201cI love you, baby. More than my life\u2014you know that. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, Jack,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it will,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you better pant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should never have let you do all that cleaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh...Just breathe...\u201d</p><p>He heard the sound of voices outside their bedroom. Brie stuck her head in the door. \u201cNeed anything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA basin or bowl. The baby bathtub of warm water. John Stone would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s here. He\u2019s scrubbing up in the kitchen sink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him to get in here now. Tell him she\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite here,\u201d Mel said. \u201cBut she\u2019s coming...\u201d Mel looked at Jack. She reached out a hand and touched the hair at his temple. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a little gray here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig surprise. I really didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be such a handful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the best thing that ever happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said in a breath. He leaned down and kissed her brow. \u201cYeah, baby. You sure are. And you\u2019re a reproductive genius.\u201d</p><p>John came into the room, all smiles. \u201cYou have a nice little birthing party going on out there, Mel. What\u2019ve we got here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d Jack said, getting up.</p><p>John lifted the flashlight with a clean towel, fixed the light on Mel\u2019s pelvic floor and said, \u201cYup. We\u2019re ready. How about you two? You ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, I\u2019m so glad to see you,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m just so glad to be here. Jack, why don\u2019t you glove up, help me out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cSure. I can do that. How you doing, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d Mel replied.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack,\u201d John said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ahead. I\u2019m right here. Go ahead, bring her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, man,\u201d he said, backing away.</p><p>\u201cCome on\u2014you know you want to. Might as well. You did the hard part. You put up with this for nine months.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d Mel objected. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>But Jack got a funny, dreamy look on his face and said, \u201cYeah. Let me bring her out. Let me. Since you\u2019re right here...\u201d All these months of insisting this wasn\u2019t what he wanted and suddenly it was all he wanted. He\u2019d pulled the last one right out of her body and he felt as if he\u2019d gone to heaven, it was such a trip. He gloved up real fast. \u201cThere won\u2019t be anyone for Mel\u2019s back,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her back, and I\u2019ll coach you,\u201d John offered. \u201cBut you\u2019re okay, you know what to do. Go for it, man. It\u2019s your baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, getting himself settled on his knees, right at the foot of the bed, and waited through a few more contractions, and then she delivered the baby\u2019s head. Without even being told, he checked around the neck for the cord. John left Mel for a second to look over his shoulder to be sure. Then Jack supported the baby\u2019s head with a large hand and John told Mel to give them a little push. The baby came out slick and easy, mucky and screaming.</p><p>Jack held another life he\u2019d produced in his hands. No one should be this lucky, he thought. No man on earth should have all this.</p><p>John spread the baby towel over Mel\u2019s belly and Jack placed the baby there and began to dry her off so he could wrap her in a clean, dry blanket. He clamped and cut the cord.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take care of the placenta,\u201d John said. \u201cYou get that little girl to her mother, then to the breast.\u201d</p><p>Now Jack was on terra firma\u2014he\u2019d done this before. He wrapped her, moved her into Mel\u2019s arms and got down on his knees to watch as his baby daughter nuzzled against Mel\u2019s warm flesh for a little while, then rooted and finally latched onto the breast, suckling. \u201cAaah,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cAnother genius.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled off the gloves and ran a couple of fingers along Mel\u2019s cheek, then over the baby\u2019s head. She turned her watering eyes up to his face. \u201cYou\u2019re getting pretty good at this,\u201d she said in a weak whisper.</p><p>\u201cI am, huh. So are you. Mel, she\u2019s gorgeous. Positively gorgeous. She\u2019s going to look like you.\u201d He leaned over the baby to put his lips against hers. He moved over her mouth lightly. \u201cGod, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s smaller than David,\u201d Mel whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good size,\u201d Jack said, as if he knew. \u201cGod, she\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do this to me one more time without my permission, you\u2019re a dead man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, honey. I\u2019ll be careful...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all those people out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get out there and tell them, if they mess up my clean house, they\u2019re going to pay. Pay, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cI hear you, Mel.\u201d</p><p>Walt Booth was just dishing up dinner\u2014two plates of fish he\u2019d steamed in foil packages on the barbecue, wild rice and fresh broccoli\u2014when the phone rang. The answering machine was in the kitchen and he decided to listen before picking up. \u201cDad? Dad, are you there?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>He picked up the phone. \u201cRight here. Everything all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all at the Sheridans\u2019. Mel\u2019s in labor! We\u2019re waiting\u2014and according to Mel it isn\u2019t going to be long. Want to come over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just about to eat some fish I cooked. I\u2019ll be along...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll have Paul save you a cigar.\u201d Then she hung up.</p><p>Walt looked over the kitchen counter at Muriel, who was still on one of his bar stools with a glass of wine. She tilted her head and smiled at him. He brought the plates to the table. \u201cI think you\u2019re about to have your debut,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou think so, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel, the local midwife, is in labor, and it\u2019s kind of a tradition around here for friends to gather at the house, see the baby fresh out of the chute, have a drink and a cigar. It\u2019s a girl, I hear. We should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met Mel. Just as I thought,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell your daughter you were having me to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said, sitting down opposite her. \u201cVanessa would have stayed home. That didn\u2019t fit into my plans.\u201d</p><p>Muriel laughed and dipped into her fish\u2014sea bass that Walt had seasoned wonderfully. She sighed and let her eyes drift closed for a second in appreciation.</p><p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cYou could do that. I could teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll enjoy dinner, leave the dishes in the sink and then run out to the Sheridans\u2019. How does that sound to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to see the baby,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like to meet your daughter and little grandson. After all, I introduced you to Luce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is going to get Vanessa a lot more excited than Luce was when she met me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible,\u201d Muriel replied, thinking of her Lab\u2019s wild reaction every time she saw Walt.</p><p>Thirty minutes later they were en route in Walt\u2019s SUV, having left Muriel\u2019s truck at his house. Their timing was perfect; the little baby girl was just making her first public appearance. And when Walt walked into the house with Muriel, Vanessa\u2019s chin almost dropped to the floor. \u201cVanni, meet our new neighbor, Muriel St. Claire. Muriel, this is my daughter. And this,\u201d he said, turning toward Jack, who held a small pink bundle in his arms, \u201cmust be the new Sheridan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cOh my God, look at her! I\u2019ve never seen a baby this new! She\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to hold her a second?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know how,\u201d Muriel said. There was that look, Walt thought. Vulnerable. He\u2019d remember that. \u201cPuppies and foals I can handle\u2014human newborns...Maybe I shouldn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Jack laughed. \u201cSupport her head.\u201d He shifted the baby into her arms. \u201cThere you go. It\u2019s not that hard.\u201d</p><p>Vanni was still staring openmouthed at her father, but Walt was completely oblivious to his daughter. He had a dreamy smile on his face as he watched Muriel. He had learned that there had never been children for Muriel, that she wished she\u2019d had a long marriage like his and maybe a couple of kids. He hadn\u2019t asked her a lot of personal questions about her relationships because he was a little afraid of the answers, but he knew this was new territory for her. It warmed him to see her experience this for the first time.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Vanni whispered, sidling close to him. \u201cWere you spending the evening with Muriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was cooking her dinner,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should see the way she eats. Wouldn\u2019t keep a rabbit alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Dad, you didn\u2019t mention anything about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t, Vanessa. She\u2019s a new neighbor. Only been in that house a couple of months. In fact, I didn\u2019t even know she was around till I ran into her out on the trail. She has a couple of horses. Nice woman. You\u2019ll like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>He finally turned to look at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDad, do you realize that\u2019s Muriel St. Claire? The actress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. She mentioned that, yes. Nice woman, you\u2019ll like her.\u201d</p><p>Vanni just shook her head in confusion. But her attention was drawn back to Jack as he presented little Emma to the rest of the gathering, giving each one a chance to admire her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Vanessa,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cI should have said how pleased I am to meet you\u2014but I was completely distracted by the baby.\u201d She put out her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa took the hand, but she said, \u201cYou and my father...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre neighbors,\u201d Muriel said with a smile.</p><p>Then Jack took the baby back to his wife and invited the women to follow. They all did, including Muriel.</p><p>Muriel went straight to Mel, leaned over the bed and with a smile said, \u201cCongratulations. Excellent work\u2014she\u2019s magnificent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuriel!\u201d Mel exclaimed tiredly, clearly surprised.</p><p>\u201cI was having dinner with Walt when the call came. I\u2019m so glad I got to be a part of this. I held the baby,\u201d she added a little conspiratorially.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you again. But we\u2019ll have to meet under other circumstances from now on. We\u2019re not going to keep doing this. Jack has strict orders not to knock me up again without permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery smart,\u201d Muriel agreed.</p><p>Shots were poured for the men, and Doc showed up right about then as if he\u2019d whiffed the whiskey. John Stone abstained because he had another woman in early labor, but he accepted the cigar. The women stayed with Mel in the bedroom, but Muriel stepped out onto the porch with the men. They all turned to look at her with puzzled expressions on their faces as she joined their group.</p><p>\u201cI heard there would be a drink and a cigar,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>They all stared at her dumbly except Walt\u2014he was somehow not at all surprised by this. \u201cI can take care of that,\u201d Walt said. He went into the house to pour her a drink and brought it back to her. By the time he\u2019d returned, Mike Valenzuela had snipped the end of a big ugly cigar for her. She accepted her drink and waited her turn for the lighter. Once she had her cigar going, she lifted her glass. \u201cTo you, Jack, and to your amazing wife, and to the newest Sheridan. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>It was almost midnight when John Stone reached into his pocket and pulled out his pager. \u201cI\u2019ve got another one coming. They come in batches,\u201d he said, jogging off to the ambulance. \u201cFull moon,\u201d he yelled over his shoulder. And with lights flashing on top of the Grace Valley ambulance, John was gone.</p><p>A few minutes later the birthing party packed up, leaving the Sheridans to themselves. When Walt and Muriel got back to his house he turned to look at her before opening the car door. \u201cI\u2019d just like to say one thing, Muriel. I thought it was going to be a real challenge, the way you eat celery and yogurt and little bitty slices of cheese, but damned if you aren\u2019t a good time.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cWell, thank you, Walt. You\u2019re not that dull, yourself. Your daughter\u2019s going to have a lot of questions for you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cShe can ask all she wants. I don\u2019t really have too much to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalt, there isn\u2019t much to say,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Not yet, there isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>W hen Brie pulled up to Jack\u2019s the early morning after the birth, she found her brother and nephew out on the porch. David was having his Cheerios, Jack was having his coffee. \u201cMorning,\u201d she said, getting out of the car. \u201cDid you sleep at all last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep within twenty-four hours of a baby. Mel\u2019s out like a light. And David wants her, of course. That\u2019s why we\u2019re out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m here to help you out,\u201d Brie said. She planned to spend at least the morning with her brother and sister-in-law, if not the whole day. She would take care of David and help around the house. \u201cWhen I left last night there was a lot of laundry waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly done. But by this afternoon, I\u2019m going to need a nap.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll cover for you,\u201d she said. \u201cHow\u2019s everyone doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019re about due another feeding. Can you handle Davie? Morning bath and stuff?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jack took his coffee cup with him back to the bedroom and pulled the rocker next to the bed.</p><p>Mel looked a little pale to him. The second baby was supposed to be easier and she sure came faster, but this one had been hard on her. Mel was weak and shaky when she roused to nurse during the night. In the cradle beside the bed, Emma started to fuss. She was going to need to be fed, but his wife wasn\u2019t stirring yet. He wanted to pick up the baby, but it was better if Mel heard her\u2014that snuffling from the baby helped with the breast milk. It was just amazing to him the way a woman\u2019s body responded to all this, the way something like the baby\u2019s cry could cause the milk to let down and drip like a faucet.</p> <p>He reached out a hand to touch his wife\u2019s brow and found her clammy. \u201cMel,\u201d he said softly. Maybe there were too many blankets on her.</p><p>Emma made her demands known a little louder, but Mel still didn\u2019t stir. \u201cMel,\u201d he said more loudly, giving her shoulder a little shake. She didn\u2019t wake. \u201cMel,\u201d he said. Nothing.</p><p>Jack felt something squeeze his heart and hit his gut like a punch. He pulled back the covers and under his wife was a large, spreading pool of blood.</p><p>\u201cBrie!\u201d he screamed. \u201cGod! Brie!\u201d</p><p>He picked up the phone and called John at home. Before the phone rang through Brie was in the doorway with David on her hip. She saw the blood, her sister-in-law motionless, and she ran to put David into the safety of his crib.</p> <p>Susan Stone answered the phone.</p><p>\u201cSusan, Mel\u2019s hemorrhaging! She\u2019s unconscious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus. Start massaging her uterus, like you saw John doing after delivery. Press down from the top, cup your other hand just above the pubic bone to support the uterus. Stay with me now.\u201d Then without putting down the phone, he heard her pick up the other line and in just seconds she was asking for emergency airlift transport. \u201cJack,\u201d she said, \u201cgive me your coordinates.\u201d</p><p>A man who\u2019d built his own house knew every detail, and he rattled off his latitude and longitude. Phone cradled between his ear and shoulder, he said, \u201cHelp me, Susan! Blood\u2019s coming! What can I do?\u201d</p><p>But she was repeating the location information into a second phone and responding to some questions. A moment later she was back on the line with Jack. \u201cWe\u2019re so damn lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cJohn had an emergency and was airlifted to Redding a couple of hours ago\u2014the helicopter is nearby, en route back to Eureka, and they\u2019re diverting to you. Jack, are you massaging?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes she have a pulse?\u201d</p><p>He put his fingers to her neck. Blood from his fingertips left a garish streak on her neck. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s weak. Soft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have helicopter transport in less than five minutes. Are you alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie\u2019s here,\u201d he said, kneading Mel\u2019s lower belly.</p><p>\u201cShe needs Pitocin. Methergine. Where\u2019s Mel\u2019s bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Jack said. \u201cRight here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. Show Brie how to massage. Jack, I need you to draw a syringe of Pitocin. Jack? You there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he muttered. At that moment Brie ran into the room. \u201cBrie. Massage her uterus like this,\u201d he said, showing her. \u201cDamn.\u201d He tried to shake the fear out of his head. \u201cI have to give her something,\u201d he said. \u201cSusan?\u201d he said into the phone.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you through it. Find the vial of Pitocin and a syringe. We\u2019re going to give her Pitocin first. Her blood pressure has never been high, so we\u2019ll follow with Methergine. She\u2019s bleeding from the uterus and it needs to contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusan,\u201d Jack said into the phone as he watched Brie squeezing Mel\u2019s lower abdomen. \u201cBlood\u2019s coming. Clots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Jack. Right now, get the drugs.\u201d</p><p>He dug around in Mel\u2019s bag and found what he was looking for. \u201cReady,\u201d he said. With the phone cradled against his ear he followed her precise directions, drew the Pitocin into the syringe first. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll find a vein....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to inject in the muscle, Jack. Just roll her a bit to the side\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI know where. I\u2019ve had plenty of shots....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull back on the syringe to check for blood return,\u201d Susan said. \u201cDon\u2019t waste time. The paramedics will have more of what we need. She\u2019ll need a few doses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNow the Methergine,\u201d she said, walking him through it. \u201cTime is short here. Once the paramedics get there, they can open a line and Pit her. Keep this phone line open in case you need me\u2014do what I told you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCheck the uterus. Can you tell if it\u2019s firming up a little?\u201d</p><p>He brushed his sister\u2019s hands out of the way and resumed the massage. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe a little. Yeah, a little...But blood\u2019s coming. More clots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Just keep massaging. You\u2019re doing great.\u201d</p><p>He moved away and, on instinct, Brie took over. Jack dug through Mel\u2019s bag again, looking for more Pitocin or Methergine. \u201cSusan, there isn\u2019t any more....We used everything she had!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be there any second. Just don\u2019t stop massaging. While we\u2019re waiting for the chopper why don\u2019t you put the baby to the breast.\u201d</p><p>Jack dropped the phone.</p><p>He plucked the wailing Emma out of the cradle and positioned her against the breast, slipping an arm under Mel\u2019s shoulders to raise her a bit. He held them both. He squeezed and tickled Emma\u2019s little cheek with the nipple, the way he\u2019d seen his wife do it. \u201cCome on, baby. Come on. We need you to\u2014\u201d Emma found the nipple and began to attempt to nurse. She wasn\u2019t a hearty nurser yet and she was still upset from crying, but she did manage to get hold of the nipple, though not with great strength.</p><p>\u201cIs it slowing? The bleeding?\u201d he asked Brie.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d he said. \u201cMel, baby, come on. Open your eyes for me, baby. Oh God, don\u2019t do this, Mel.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open. She looked up at Jack and in a weak whisper she said, \u201cUh-oh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, you hang in there. The helicopter\u2019s on its way and it\u2019s close. You stay with me, Mel.\u201d Then, \u201cCome on, Emma. Come on.\u201d But the baby was having trouble, probably because of the panic. Terrified, he slipped his arm out from under his wife, put the crying baby back in the cradle and, kneeling beside the bed, he began to massage her breasts in the way Mel would if she were pumping. He remembered then\u2014remembered when David was born and he handed her the baby to nurse. Come on little guy, she had said. Bring out the placenta and stanch the bleeding. Then he leaned over her, put his mouth on her and drew gently, suckling, and the warm, sweet milk came into his mouth. And tears threatened to blind his eyes.</p><p>He felt her hand, weak and light, touching his head, threading fingers through his short hair. He nursed from her, and prayed it would help.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s slowing,\u201d Brie said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely slowing. But damn, Jack, there\u2019s so much...\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head from Mel\u2019s breast and saw that her eyes were open just a bit and there was a faint, almost imperceptible smile on her lips. \u201cYou stay with me, Mel. Goddammit, you stay with me!\u201d He suckled a bit more. To Brie he said, \u201cKeep massaging her uterus.\u201d Then he bolted from the house, leaping off the porch steps and racing to his truck. He opened the storage locker in the bed and pulled out a flare, ripping it open to burn and tossing it in the dirt driveway as a guide for the helicopter. He was back on his knees beside his wife, drawing on her breast again in less than thirty seconds.</p><p>Emma was crying, David was screaming and Mel was passed out again.</p><p>He put his lips on her forehead and prayed. God, I\u2019ll do anything. I\u2019ll do anything. Don\u2019t take her from me!</p><p>He repeatedly checked Mel\u2019s pulse, suckled and prayed. It was the longest two minutes of his life until he heard the sound of rotor blades. For a moment he was thrown back in time, almost an out-of-body experience\u2014he was surrounded by dust and smoke as the choppers came into the rocky desert to pick up his wounded. His eyes glazed over, he was back there in Iraq, desperate to save his men.</p><p>He forced his mind through the maze of flashback. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d to Brie as he ran from the room to the porch just as the helicopter landed in the clearing in front of his house. He thought back to the last battle he\u2019d fought\u2014a battle he\u2019d fight a thousand more times if it would save his wife. The medics had a saying\u2014if we can get you to the chopper, you\u2019re going to live.</p><p>He saw two medics jump out and run toward the house with a stretcher. \u201cThis way,\u201d he yelled. \u201cI\u2019ve given her two doses of Pitocin and one of Methergine,\u201d he yelled as he jogged back into the house with them on his heels. \u201cI think the bleeding slowed a little, but it\u2019s still heavy. Real heavy.\u201d</p><p>They followed him into the master bedroom and immediately took over. An IV was started. He\u2019d watched Mel do it a dozen times, but this was the fastest work he\u2019d ever seen. They were shouting orders\u2014Ringers, Pitocin, blood pressure seventy over forty, pulse one-sixty and thready, diaphoretic, respirations shallow. \u201cLet\u2019s boogie,\u201d one of them said, throwing a towel between her legs as they lifted her quickly onto the stretcher, leaving behind a blood-soaked bed. \u201cLoad her and go, go, go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie, get Doc out here with formula for the baby.\u201d He grabbed Mel\u2019s bag and followed them out, jogging behind them toward the helicopter. They were airborne in seconds.</p><p>Jack held Mel\u2019s hand on one side of the stretcher while on the other side an inflight nurse monitored blood pressure and IV fluids. \u201cWe used all the drugs in her bag,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo Pitocin, one Methergine,\u201d he repeated to the nurse.</p><p>\u201cHer bag?\u201d the nurse asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a midwife. I left the syringes behind, but threw the empty vials in the bag. The OB\u2019s wife, a nurse, talked me through it.\u201d</p><p>The nurse relayed that to the pilot and after a minute the pilot shouted back that he\u2019d been radioed a second order for Methergine and the nurse plucked the ampoule out of their supply, drew the syringe and pushed it into the IV. Another few minutes passed; Mel opened her eyes, looked at Jack and mouthed, \u201cI love you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>He put his lips by her ear. \u201cMelinda, you are my life. You are my whole life, baby. You stay with me. John\u2019s at the hospital, honey. We\u2019re going to the hospital. You hang on. You\u2019re going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>Jack heard the pilot radio the hospital that they were inbound and relayed that there was an OR team and anesthesiologist standing by. The nurse pulled back the blanket to gently part Mel\u2019s legs and look at the bleeding. \u201cI think we\u2019re gonna make it,\u201d she said. Then she said softly, \u201cDear God, let us make it.\u201d</p><p>If Jack weren\u2019t so terrified, he\u2019d be impressed by how fast the team could move. When they touched down, the nurse and EMTs on board had that gurney out of the chopper so fast they almost knocked Jack out of the way. Waiting for them were emergency nurses and a doctor. They ran into the hospital where someone was standing at the elevator, holding the door open. Jack stayed with them, but he was stopped as they flew into the surgery.</p><p>Jack stood outside the doors, staring. He had no idea what to do, but he wasn\u2019t leaving her. He couldn\u2019t even sit down. His heart was pounding, he was sweating, hyperventilating, dying inside. He\u2019d faced his own death with more calm than this.</p><p>Five or ten minutes passed before a nurse came out to talk to him. \u201cMr. Sheridan, she has a uterine hemorrhage and has lost a lot of blood. Dr. Stone took her immediately into surgery to try to stop the bleeding. It\u2019s possible he\u2019ll have to do a hysterectomy. It\u2019s going to be a while before we\u2019ll have anything more to tell you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to make it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer situation is life threatening, Mr. Sheridan. But Dr. Stone is very, very good. He\u2019s being assisted by Dr. Larson, an excellent surgeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, running a hand over the top of his head. \u201cGod.\u201d Confused and terrified, he turned around in a complete circle twice. Then to the nurse he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to the chapel, but I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p> <p>Jack made one phone call, to Brie. Then he found the chapel and though he had no idea what good it did, he lit a bunch of candles. His shaking hand made the light flicker so much he almost couldn\u2019t make contact. He didn\u2019t even have a wallet with him to leave money in the box but he was thinking, If she lives, I\u2019ll write this hospital a check for a million dollars. Then he went into the second pew, got on his knees, leaned his elbows on the pew in front of him and prayed.</p><p>God, I know you\u2019re sick of hearing me beg, but this is my woman, my wife. My best friend! No, she\u2019s so much more than that\u2014she\u2019s the other half of my heart. I\u2019ve waited my whole life for her\u2014I\u2019d give my life a hundred times to keep her safe! A thousand times! She\u2019s every breath I take, every single beat of my heart. I don\u2019t think I can live without her now. Not now...Please, God. Please. Oh God, please...</p><p>A half hour later he was back upstairs, sitting outside the surgery. He saw the second hand pass through every minute for two hours before John finally came out of surgery. Jack stood up.</p><p>\u201cWe made it in time, Jack\u2014we got so lucky. We had a helicopter in flight, not far from you\u2014a miracle in itself. She got critical drugs in time, thanks to you digging through her bag. But, Jack\u2014I wasn\u2019t able to save her uterus. I\u2019m sorry. I know you wanted more children.\u201d</p><p>Jack fell into the chair, his elbows on his knees, his head in his hands. His shoulders shook briefly as relief poured out of him, and when he looked back up at John, tears ran down his stubbled cheek and he said, \u201cMan, the uterus doesn\u2019t mean anything. I can\u2019t live without her.\u201d</p> <p>John put a strong hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou have many years with her left to you, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, thank you. Thank you, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Susan made a good team, then putting that baby to the breast to nurse,\u201d John said, shaking his head in wonder.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the baby,\u201d Jack said weakly, wondering if his legs would ever hold him upright again. Remembering his fear that his last memory of his beloved wife would be taking her milk as he tried anything to keep her alive. \u201cEmma wouldn\u2019t nurse. I did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d John said. \u201cYou might\u2019ve given us the couple of minutes we needed to save her life.\u201d</p><p>Jack called Brie to tell her Mel was out of surgery, then he stood at the recovery-room doors without moving for another two hours until he was allowed in. A unit of blood dangled above her, but her skin was still pasty white, her eyes dark and sunken, her lips so dry they appeared cracked. She looked so tiny, it was scary. He bent over her, slipping an arm under her shoulders, lifting her a bit. He pressed his lips against her forehead and her eyes opened weakly. \u201cJack,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cAw, Mel, you scared me just terrible,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be any more babies, Jack,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe have all we need. Two perfect, healthy kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you were going to try to sneak one more by me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to,\u201d he said. \u201cI promised you time to enjoy your kids. I have more with you and them than I ever thought I\u2019d have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, a weak laugh escaping her. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re within reach, I\u2019m destined to never have a period.\u201d</p><p>This was so like her, to joke around with him when she\u2019d nearly died. \u201cClose your eyes and rest, Mel. I\u2019ll stay with you. I won\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be with my children,\u201d she whispered, her eyes closing.</p> <p>\u201cPretty soon, Mel. Shh. Pretty soon I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>He held her like that, stooped over her bed rail, for another hour. The nurse tried to urge him away to check her bleeding, but he wasn\u2019t inclined to go. John came up to the three of them and said to the nurse, \u201cI got it.\u201d He pulled the curtains around the bed. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand about you,\u201d John said to Jack. \u201cI guess if you can deliver your own children, you\u2019re all checked out on peri-pads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll checked out,\u201d Jack said, dropping another kiss on her brow. \u201cYou going to stay all day?\u201d he asked John.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t figured out how I\u2019m getting back to Grace Valley yet. Plus, I want to run in another unit of blood. I\u2019ll stick around for that at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t hanging around because she\u2019s in any danger, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m hanging around to keep you from being thrown out.\u201d He lifted the sheet and as he gently pulled apart her legs, she roused briefly. \u201cGood,\u201d John said. \u201cLooking much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Jack told Mel.</p><p>\u201cYou should think about getting back to your kids,\u201d John suggested. \u201cOnce I figure out the transportation, I can take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until she\u2019s fully conscious and knows why I\u2019m not here. Preacher would come for me. We\u2019ll work that out,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to turn her over to Larson, and he\u2019s going to keep her a few days,\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cYou have to get her a breast pump. You know how she is about nursing. And Emma\u2019s the last one\u2014you know how she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll get a pump, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Another hour passed, Mel rousing from time to time, Jack holding her all the while. John came in again and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take her to her room now, and there\u2019s someone out in the hall to see you. Meet us upstairs\u2014306.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jack said, gently lowering Mel\u2019s shoulders to the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you in a minute, baby. You\u2019re going to your room now.\u201d</p><p>When Jack walked through the swinging doors there stood Doc, leaning heavily on his cane, looking both frazzled and exhausted, as if he\u2019d aged years in a few hours. Doc had driven all the way over that mountain pass to get here. It would\u2019ve taken hours. Jack stepped up to him and put out a hand. \u201cIt was close,\u201d he said.</p><p>Doc shook his head. \u201cThank God. We can\u2019t do without her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen can I see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me, Doc. We\u2019ll go up to her room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn says she\u2019s going to be all right now,\u201d Doc said.</p><p>\u201cYup. We have her back. No more babies, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think she\u2019s going to feel about that?\u201d</p><p>Jack was remembering how pissy she\u2019d been when she found out she was pregnant with Emma. Then how, later, she\u2019d said, I sure love carrying around a little piece of you. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be fine. We have each other. We have David and Emma, two more than we thought we\u2019d get. Did Brie call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. The whole town is standing by.\u201d When they got to her room, Mel was slightly elevated in the bed, taking a sip of water through a straw. Doc seemed to be limping a little more than usual as he entered the room. He went straight to her and did something he\u2019d never done before. He leaned over the bed and kissed her on the forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot of trouble, Melinda. I knew from the start you would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep you young,\u201d she said tiredly.</p><p>\u201cYou do, at that. But I think you\u2019re wearing Jack down.\u201d</p><p>Taking care of the Sheridans was a family and community affair. Brie and Mel\u2019s sister Joey took care of the babies so Jack could go to the hospital; Paige and Preacher made sure there was food ready for every evening meal. At the end of the day, Mike came to the house to be with his wife and wait for Jack to come home with his daily report. Jack got up very early to make that long drive over the mountains to Redding, stayed all day and came back to Virgin River late, after dark.</p><p>On the fourth such day, Brie sat in the big leather chair holding Emma close with her bottle while Mike was in the rocker with David and his bottle. The door opened and Jack came in, looking exhausted, carrying his little cooler that would contain the breast milk Mel had pumped. Brie lifted her chin in greeting and he lifted a hand in response, then went to the kitchen. It was easily six hours of driving each day, but he wouldn\u2019t even consider not being with Mel every day. Brie had been very worried about him being sleep deprived as he drove over the pass.</p><p>Once Brie and Mike had their charges settled, they joined the gathering in Jack\u2019s kitchen and found that Preacher had dinner almost complete and was setting up a couple of drinks for himself, Mike and Jack. \u201cHow\u2019s our girl?\u201d Brie asked.</p><p>\u201cFeisty,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to kick her to the curb tomorrow. She\u2019s giving them fits. Nurses make lousy patients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me saying so, you look whipped,\u201d Brie said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, precious,\u201d he said, lifting his glass. \u201cWhoa, that helps. My thanks.\u201d He put the glass down and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go kiss my kids and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>The kitchen was quiet for a moment. Preacher broke the silence with, \u201cI can\u2019t believe how close we came to losing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very unusual for something like that to happen,\u201d Brie said, trying to reassure him, given Paige\u2019s pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cIt reminds you, though, what a serious business this is.\u201d He pulled Paige close. \u201cWe have to take this real serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you do this, John,\u201d Paige said. \u201cWe had a close call, everything is okay now, and we\u2019re not going to panic. We\u2019re going to enjoy this pregnancy. God knows we worked hard enough for it.\u201d She turned to her son. \u201cYou about done there, buddy? Ready for your movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mom,\u201d he said sweetly.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cCome on, cowboy,\u201d he said, taking his little hand. \u201cI\u2019ll help you get comfortable.\u201d As he walked out of the kitchen Preacher was heard to ask, \u201cWhat are we watching tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncredibles,\u201d Chris said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we watch that almost every night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost.\u201d</p><p>Joey looked at Paige. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful father, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust amazing. I still can\u2019t believe how lucky I\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>When Jack came back to the kitchen, Joey said, \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to ask you something, Jack. How\u2019s Mel with the hysterectomy?\u201d</p><p>He dropped his gaze and lifted his drink. \u201cDisappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cFor all her bitching about being pregnant all the time, she actually wanted to be pregnant some more. It defies understanding. She carried on about Emma coming too soon, threatened me with certain death if I did it to her again, kept reminding me how old I am, and yet\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence.</p><p>\u201cBeing able to reproduce is a funny thing,\u201d Brie said. \u201cWe just want to control it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in my experience, it\u2019s one of those forces of nature with a mind of its own,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWhen you want it, it doesn\u2019t come. When you\u2019d like to take a break, it\u2019s all over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you with it?\u201d Joey asked him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d He lifted his drink. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to have Mel come through this, it doesn\u2019t even cross my mind. Besides, I have two healthy kids. I\u2019m a rich man. A very rich man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo rich men,\u201d Mike said, joining the toast.</p><p>Only a week after Melinda\u2019s hysterectomy, she was getting around very well. She had some surgical soreness and tired easily; she didn\u2019t wander around the house much. She dressed in a comfy sweat suit and stayed mainly on the big king-size bed, the cradle close at hand so she could nurse Emma as often as possible, trying to get her caught up. All she had to do was give Davie a little boost under the bum and he could climb up to the bed with her.</p><p>With Brie and Joey in charge of the house during the day, making sure Mel had everything she needed and was getting plenty of rest, Jack was able to spend a few hours at the bar in the afternoon. Then he could take dinner home to his wife.</p><p>He didn\u2019t get a lot done at the bar. He didn\u2019t dare go on supply runs, it would take him too far from Virgin River. But he added up receipts and inventoried, finding, unsurprisingly, the bar ran just fine under the watchful care of Paige and Preacher.</p> <p>In that little space of time after lunch was finished, and before the dinner crowd began to drift in, when the bar was typically very quiet, often deserted, an old familiar ghost in his Shady Brady wandered in. Jack had had some traffic with this guy in the past; some good, some not so good. He was a known illegal grower from somewhere around the mountains and Jack had refused to take his money once because it stank of freshly cut marijuana. But he\u2019d materialized out of nowhere one night when Paige was in danger and saved her life.</p><p>He came up to the bar and for once made actual eye contact with Jack. A first. \u201cHey,\u201d he said somberly. \u201cHow\u2019s the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting by,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cHeineken and Beam,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not too much trouble.\u201d</p><p>Over the man\u2019s shoulder, Jack saw Mike come into the bar. He stopped short, obviously recognizing their friend from the broad expanse of his back and the familiar hat. Jack looked back at his customer. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou know what kind of money doesn\u2019t work in this bar and I\u2019m not comping you. I\u2019m in no mood.\u201d</p> <p>Mike sat up at the bar, just one stool separating him from the stranger. \u201cI got that, Jack. I\u2019ll have a beer. Take care of my friend here.\u201d Mike pulled out a few bills. \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d Jack asked Mike.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Jack set them up with drinks, then went back down the bar to where his trusty clipboard with inventory sheets waited. There was no conversation between Mike and the Shady Brady. Just silent, serious drinking.</p><p>Paige came into the bar carrying a fresh stack of towels. She recognized the man, was paralyzed for a moment, then gave him a very slight nod before escaping back into the kitchen. Mike half expected to see Preacher right away, but nothing more happened. Then there was a low, rumbled comment from the man next to him. \u201cThings worked out then,\u201d he said, having noticed the obvious pregnancy.</p><p>Mike chuckled in spite of himself. \u201cOh, yeah. Just fine.\u201d He looked at the man and lifted a brow. \u201cOnce more on that boilermaker?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah. I don\u2019t want to put you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Mike called. \u201cFix up my friend here.\u201d</p><p>Though Jack scowled disapprovingly, he served the whiskey and refreshed the beer. It was a strange situation\u2014Jack appreciated the help the man had given them in an emergency, but he wanted nothing to do with growers. They were trouble. And he wouldn\u2019t have their money in his till. He went back to his clipboard and counting, leaving the men to finish their drinks.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before the stranger scraped back his stool to stand up. He looked at Mike and tipped the brim of his hat.</p><p>Mike pulled a hand out of his jacket pocket, put something on the bar and slid it toward him, turning his black eyes up at the standing man. He took away his hand and there, on the bar, was a padlock.</p><p>Shady Brady glanced over his shoulder toward Jack, finding him occupied with counting bottles beneath the bar. He slid the padlock off the bar and into his pocket. \u201cThanks for the drinks,\u201d he said to Mike.</p><p>\u201cHey. Don\u2019t worry about it. Even a private sort of guy like you should catch a break sometimes, huh?\u201d He jutted his chin toward Jack. \u201cHe\u2019s not real flexible.\u201d Then Mike looked back into his beer.</p><p>For the first time ever, Shady Brady gave a quick, short grin. He touched the brim of his hat again, though no one was watching him. Then he quit the bar.</p> <p>Mike smiled into his beer. There, he was thinking. Mike knew and Shady Brady knew he knew. Something about him was iffy\u2014but not all bad. Their business was done. At least for now.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>O nce the Haggerty family had been told a wedding was imminent, Paul called Joe. \u201cHow are those plans coming for Preacher and Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose to ready for you, buddy,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could sketch up another house and we could talk about design...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What you got?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Paul took a breath. \u201cYou\u2019ll never believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go the way we thought it would. Vanni\u2014she didn\u2019t let me down easy. Turns out I was a little slow, which shouldn\u2019t surprise you. We\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa! You serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wait?\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we need time to get to know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about that little problem we talked about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt turns out, it\u2019s not my problem after all. And Vanni\u2014God, man. She\u2019s been just wonderful about everything\u2014me taking so long to come clean, having a serious complication to work out, everything. We\u2019re gonna get it done before Tom leaves for boot camp in two weeks. I thought maybe, if you had some plans lying around, it might be a good time to visit Virgin River. And if the plans work for your clients\u2014I could stay right here and build.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the third set for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe and Vanni,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThe general gave us a nice big parcel on the other side of the stable and, brother, having our own house down here sounds better all the time. Might as well build it before I get real busy.\u201d</p><p>Joe laughed. \u201cGood for you, man,\u201d he said. \u201cAny idea what you\u2019re looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah\u2014Vanni loves my house in Grants Pass. But that\u2019s set up for a bachelor or a couple without kids\u2014sunken great room, that kind of thing. Raise the floor and level it, add a bedroom, more kitchen...You know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what to do.\u201d Joe laughed.</p><p>\u201cAnd come down for the wedding. It\u2019s gonna be small and quick, but Jack tells me he\u2019s calling the boys and there could be poker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal me in.\u201d</p><p>There was enough going on in Virgin River in June to create a great deal of excitement. First there was high-school graduation and the following weekend Vanni and Paul would be married. Somewhere between the two, Rick would be home on leave before shipping out to Iraq and for both his leave and the wedding, the rest of the marines would hit town.</p><p>Vanni had been busy in her father\u2019s kitchen whenever she wasn\u2019t tending to the baby, trying to prepare hors d\u2019oeuvres for a Saturday-evening open house for Tom\u2019s graduation. The youngsters would be roving from party to party and would barely make an appearance, but Walt still insisted Tom deserved a celebration of his own, not just one coupled with the wedding the following weekend. And he was right in this\u2014Tom had graduated with honors and an appointment to West Point was a huge achievement. Even though Tom had a three-star for a father, it still required a near-perfect GPA and a congressional recommendation.</p><p>Vanni took a short break and, wiping her hands on a dish towel, walked out on the deck for some cool air. What she saw took her by surprise. Paul was standing in front of Matt\u2019s grave. Memories of standing there herself came flooding back, and she walked down the deck stairs and across the lawn, up onto that small rise. \u201cPaul?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He turned, saw her there and gave her a small, sad smile, lifting his arm. \u201cAw, Vanni, Vanni...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, giving her shoulders a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if we both start brooding at this grave, it\u2019s going to drive Dad nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to make a habit of it. Listen, can I say something? Just once, then I won\u2019t again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, you can say anything to me. Are you missing him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always miss him, honey. Sometimes I think about when we were just boys together and I can see it so clearly, it\u2019s like being back there. When we were kids in high school, we never even talked about the Marine Corps. We talked about girls, sports, girls, tattoos, girls, trucks...He had all the girls, though. I never had any nerve. I wouldn\u2019t have even had a prom date if Matt hadn\u2019t made it happen. Who knew the crazy fool was going to make himself into a lifer.\u201d Paul turned and held her upper arms in his big hands, looking down into her eyes. \u201cDo you have any idea how much I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d give my life for you, that\u2019s how much. I\u2019ve never been happier than these past few weeks. But I was just telling Matt\u2014I\u2019d give it all up and live alone and miserable and jealous till the end of time if I could get him back. He was the most amazing man, the most incredible friend. It would probably kill me, but I\u2019d give this up if it meant he could live.\u201d</p><p>Vanni put a hand along his cheek. \u201cHe knows that already, Paul. He always knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to be real sad sometimes, honey. Even now. You don\u2019t ever have to hide that from me. I\u2019ll hold you through the tears now, just like I did before\u2014and I won\u2019t feel cheated. Not by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, I wouldn\u2019t hide anything from you,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cNot long after Matt and I met, I lost my mom\u2014and she was the best friend I ever had. And then I lost my husband to a war. Do you have any idea what a gift I have in you? It was like being rescued. I didn\u2019t know I could feel like this. I thought every day would hurt forever. It\u2019s probably not really stronger than what I felt for Matt, but coming after all that loss and pain, it sure feels like a miracle to me. Oh\u2014I\u2019ll always miss him, too. I can\u2019t help that. But I\u2019m so grateful to have you in my life. I\u2019m not giving you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wish there was a way I could know\u2014I wish I knew he was okay with this\u2014you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, I told you,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI ran it by him already. A few times. Before you ever let me know how you felt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could know he forgives me for\u2014for wanting you all those years you belonged to him...\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly, sweetly. \u201cI think you\u2019re being silly now. You showed him such incredible respect, never letting anyone know. Paul, there\u2019s nothing to forgive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night Mattie came, I was out here talking to him. Jack came and got me\u2014he said Matt had moved on. He said we each have our destiny and Matt\u2019s took him somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014wherever he is, he\u2019s tearing the place up, making people laugh, feel good. Paul, this would make Matt happy. You know how much you love him? He loved you that much or more. I can\u2019t think of anyone he\u2019d rather have raise his son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do the best I can with that, honey. I\u2019d sure like to make Matt proud. I\u2019ll try to be as good a husband as Matt was....\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and smiled at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to have to try. As far as I can tell, you\u2019re a natural.\u201d</p><p>Jack stood on his front porch with his morning coffee. He saw something in the distance that caused his pulse to pick up. He looked out over the valley to the northeast and saw a thin column of gray smoke that wound its way to a plateau in the sky and he hoped, beyond hope, it was nothing to worry about. It had been an unusually dry spring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mel came outside and he dropped an arm around her shoulders as she snuggled close. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFire. Could be a controlled burn, could be wildfire. It\u2019s been awful dry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Virgin River ever been threatened by fire?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot the town, no. There was a big one just north of here a few years ago. Right after Preacher showed up. Everyone pitched in. We dug a lot of ditches, hauled drinking water, drove trucks. Then we got certified in training so we could be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would happen?\u201d she asked. \u201cIf a fire got too close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, his arm tightening around her. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting in the middle of a forest, Mel. This place could end up looking like the face of the moon.\u201d He lifted his eyes to the horizon. \u201cWe need a good, solid rain. And there isn\u2019t any forecasted. This forest is pure kindling.\u201d</p><p>Tom graduated with honors and the general and Vanessa hosted a party at their home, open to all their friends and all of Tom\u2019s friends. The young people were on the move\u2014they\u2019d spend the entire weekend going from one open house to another. Tom and Brenda and some of their friends spent about an hour at the Booth home before taking off for other graduation parties, but the adults didn\u2019t mind a bit that they were left to themselves.</p><p>Everyone dropped by to pass along their congratulations, including Muriel St. Claire.</p> <p>\u201cCan we count on you to come to the wedding next Saturday?\u201d Vanessa asked her.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart, thank you for including me. Actually, I\u2019m driving to Sebastapol to pick up a dog. A little guy named Buff. Another Lab\u2014this one is yellow. I\u2019ve got a good hunter already\u2014Luce, my little girl and best friend, a year and a half and brilliant. But no dog should grow up alone.\u201d And then she grinned. \u201cBut I hope to see you soon after the wedding. It would be lovely to have dinner with you and Paul. I\u2019ll speak to Walt about that, since I can\u2019t cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt all?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>Muriel shrugged. \u201cAt all. I\u2019d like you to know, though, I have other talents. I can paint, hang paper, sand and varnish, grow vegetables, hunt duck and tell jokes. Besides, I heard there\u2019s great takeout at Jack\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is.\u201d Vanni smiled. \u201cAnd you ride, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I have two horses with me. We should go out for a ride sometime. We can meet midway between our houses along the river.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would like that so much,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cWe have a lot to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do,\u201d Muriel agreed, then gave Vanessa a conspiratorial wink.</p><p>As he was leaving the party Tom took Paul aside for a minute. Just outside the closed front door, Tom asked, \u201cSo. You ready to take on Vanessa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than ready, pal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, man. I couldn\u2019t have planned this better myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I hoped you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>Tom took a matchbook out of his pocket and flipped it around in his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s an all-night graduation party tonight that Brenda and I are going to,\u201d he said. He put the matchbook in Paul\u2019s hand. \u201cExcept we\u2019re not going to it. Someone should know where we are, in case there\u2019s any kind of emergency. Someone who can keep his big mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>Paul looked at the matchbook. The Brookstone Inn. He met eyes with Tom.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone who isn\u2019t going to ask me one more time if I have a condom in my pocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I ask that?\u201d Paul said. \u201cYou\u2019re way outta my league, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust in case someone has a heart attack or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Paul said, slipping the matchbook in his pocket. \u201cI appreciate that you think smart. Have a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d And he was gone.</p><p>When Paul went back in the house, Vanni was waiting for him. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</p><p>Paul leaned close to her ear. \u201cJust asking your brother\u2019s permission to be his brother-in-law,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s official. I\u2019m welcomed to the family.\u201d</p><p>Tom checked into the Brookstone in Ferndale while Brenda waited in the car. The way it had gone lately, they\u2019d make wild love, and then there would be some tears about him leaving, and then they\u2019d make wild love again, then they\u2019d have a few more tears. There hadn\u2019t been any long nights together since that first time at his house, but there had been some remarkable sessions, here and there, especially evenings at the Booth house when Vanni was in Grants Pass and Walt was down at Bodega Bay with Shelby.</p><p>\u201cBefore you start crying again, I have something for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He leaned over the bed and dug around on the floor for his pants, pulling a box out of the pocket. He passed it to her. \u201cIt\u2019s how I feel about you.\u201d</p><p>She opened the box and there, curled around a velvet circle, was a sparkling diamond bracelet. She was speechless. \u201cMy God,\u201d she finally said. \u201cMy God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s how I feel. If we somehow manage to keep it together, through separations and school and all that stuff, I want to be with you forever. I didn\u2019t want to get you a ring\u2014that would be too crazy. I mean, a senior in high school wearing an engagement ring? A senior like you who practically aced the SATs and is going all the way\u2014you can\u2019t be wearing an engagement ring. I want you to be thinking about yourself now\u2014you\u2019re just a girl.\u201d He took the bracelet out of the box and put it on her wrist. \u201cBut you can wear this. To remind you that I love you. And I\u2019m not leaving you to be away from you, but to start building what we\u2019re going to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she said again. \u201cIs it real?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cIt actually is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you afford this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a couple of bucks and college is paid for by the Army. It\u2019s not the best diamond bracelet ever made and the rocks are real little, but for your first one, it\u2019s okay. Later, I\u2019ll get you better diamonds, I promise. Brenda, I love you, honey. And I need you to stop crying. Leaving is hard enough. I\u2019ll be back in August for a little while, before I start West Point. You can make it till then, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make it as long as you need me to,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy, you know. Even if you go to school in New York. We\u2019re going to be mostly separated for four years, maybe five while you finish\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cFour. I\u2019m going to finish college in three.\u201d She stared at her bracelet, then when she lifted her eyes to his, she raised one light brown brow and smiled. \u201cDo you have any doubt I can do that?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cNone whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going wherever you go, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Army is going to keep me from getting married while I\u2019m at West Point. This next four years, this is when we\u2019re going to find out what we\u2019re made of, because Army life isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s good, and it\u2019s strong, but it\u2019s not easy. My dad always said that sometimes the Army spouses have to be tougher than the soldiers\u2014my mom was left to raise us alone so many times. I know she was lonely, sometimes scared, and she was probably pissed some of the time, but she was so proud of my dad\u2019s work. You\u2019d never know it was hard for her. You have to know that going in, it\u2019s just not easy. If you change your mind, if someone else comes along that can offer you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She put a hand against his cheek. \u201cWhat if someone comes along for you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBrenda\u2014I think all I\u2019m going to get in the Army are sore muscles and a completely worn-out brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know\u2014there could be some really sexy drill sergeant,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cListen to me now. My mind is made up, but I want you to promise me\u2014keep your options open. Have fun, be a single girl and enjoy yourself. Take a good hard look around you, a long look at the world. When this four years is up, you have to be sure. You have to think I\u2019m your best choice\u2014not your only choice. I don\u2019t want you to ever think you made a mistake, betting on me and this life. Because if you\u2019re still my girl, I\u2019m going to marry you the first day I can, and then I\u2019m not letting you go without a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep my eyes open, Tommy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I bet my heart will only be able to see you. And I\u2019ll miss you so much, but I\u2019m proud of you. I know we\u2019re pretty young\u2014but I\u2019m not too young to know I have to marry a man I can be that proud of.\u201d</p><p>It made him smile. \u201cI\u2019ll work on making sure you always feel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to hate my dad for coming up with Virgin River,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cNow I\u2019m thinking of putting him in my will.\u201d</p><p>Jack drove to Garberville to pick up Ricky from the bus early the next Wednesday morning. He was thinking about the phone call he\u2019d had from Ricky a few weeks ago. It changed his world, but it was something he could have predicted.</p><p>The boy stepped off the bus not in uniform, but in his jeans and boots. Even so, that jarhead haircut branded him as a marine on leave. Jack\u2019s chest swelled with pride. Boy? This was no boy. Here was a man, a fighting marine, who had matured and grown even stronger in the months he\u2019d been away. His grin, however, was the same young, infectious, optimistic smile as when he first rode his bike up to Jack\u2019s years ago.</p><p>It took willpower not to run to him and fetch him up in his arms, but Jack stood stock-still, letting the boy\u2014the young man\u2014come to him. They grasped hands and brought themselves shoulder to shoulder. Rick had grown yet taller. He was every bit the six-two Jack was. \u201cHey, man,\u201d Ricky said.</p><p>\u201cDamn, boy. Look at you. You\u2019re almost as old as me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d Ricky laughed. \u201cLook at you. You\u2019re getting gray, what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelinda, naturally. She\u2019s working me over. You should be careful, Rick. Strong, sexy women? They\u2019ll kill you slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a way to go, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t complain. It\u2019s turning out to be a big weekend here, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul\u2019s getting married. I\u2019ll catch you up on all that\u2014but the two events, your leave and Paul\u2019s wedding\u2014it\u2019s bringing the boys to town. We\u2019re going to have us a time. They\u2019ll start arriving in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. How\u2019s Mel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting around a little slow, but don\u2019t worry\u2014she\u2019s bossing me around like crazy, which tells me she\u2019s fine. She can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Preach?\u201d Ricky asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout to be a father, in a month or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Ricky said. \u201cWhen I first laid eyes on him, I would never have put money on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. By the way, your grandma is doing well. And from what I hear from her aunt Connie, your girl is excited about your leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I called Lizzie. She\u2019s a little freaked about Iraq, but it\u2019ll give her time to finish school. It\u2019s been a real headache, getting her through school...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe still trying to marry you?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sticking to my guns, man. Four years, that\u2019s the deal. Down to three now. But holy Jesus, I love her like crazy. I can\u2019t wait to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to have time for the rest of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can cut you a few minutes,\u201d he said with a grin that was all boy. \u201cTry not to jam me up too bad, huh? I\u2019ve been totally faithful to this girl for nine whole months and I am in bad shape.

He put an arm around Ricky\u2019s shoulders. Something he couldn\u2019t help but wonder was how his life might have been different if he\u2019d met his Melinda when he was sixteen. They\u2019d be broke and have twenty-seven kids by now. But he said, \u201cIraq. What shit is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the usual. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you will. There are some people I want you to meet. Paul\u2019s new wife\u2014she\u2019s something else. And I want you to meet her younger brother. He\u2019s slated for West Point. Daddy\u2019s a retired Army three-star and the kid\u2019s a year younger than you. Good kid. Sharp. He\u2019s been seen around with Brenda Carpenter this whole past year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrenda? No kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two\u2014you should meet. Talk. For both of you, Virgin River will always be your base, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jack. As long as you\u2019re here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI hooked you up with some wheels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Rick asked.</p> <p>\u201cMel\u2019s not able to work yet, which leaves Doc the Humvee and his truck sitting idle. He says it\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Rick said. \u201cI think I\u2019ll check in with my gram, then head over to Eureka to find that girl. I mean, first things first, Jack.\u201d</p><p>By noon on Friday the first of the marines arrived in the person of Joe Benson from Grants Pass. He had hooked up Paul\u2019s fifth wheel as his home away from home for the weekend and walked into Jack\u2019s with rolls of parchment under his arm and a big grin on his face. He had preliminary architectural drawings for Paige and Preacher, Mike and Brie, sketches for Paul and Vanni. Tables were pushed together, coffee was poured and plans were spread out.</p><p>Only Preacher and Mike were available to scan the drawings as Brie was at Jack\u2019s helping Mel with the babies and Paige was sharing Christopher\u2019s nap.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Mel doing?\u201d Joe asked Jack.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing great, but she hates being stuck out at the house all the time. Brie\u2019s bringing her and the little ones over later on, once most of the boys are here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe feeling okay now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gets tired real easy\u2014and you can imagine how that pisses her off,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWait till you see her. She doesn\u2019t look like someone who damn near bought the farm three weeks ago. I\u2019ll tell you what, buddy. That about did me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy howdy, as she would say.\u201d</p><p>By two, Paul came into the bar and the reunion continued. For Joe and Paul, who hadn\u2019t seen each other in at least a few weeks, there was a hearty embrace, robust congratulations to Paul. \u201cI didn\u2019t figure to see you until much later,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a maid of honor at the house,\u201d he explained. \u201cI was told I was in the way. Which suits me fine. And I think the general and Tommy will be kicked out pretty soon, too.\u201d</p><p>Next to arrive, Josh Phillips and Tom Stephens from the Reno area, pulling up in a nice cushy RV, a new purchase for Tom. Finally, Zeke, which made the crowd almost complete. \u201cCorny\u2019s putting in a no-show,\u201d Jack explained. \u201cHe\u2019s got a baby coming in a couple of months and has to save his time off for that. Number three. He\u2019s still chasing that boy.\u201d</p><p>Beer was set up and at about four, Paige came out of the back and walked right under her husband\u2019s arm. Zeke was the first to spot her and sent up a whoop of excitement, rushing toward her with a huge grin on his face. \u201cWhoa, baby, look at you! Damn me, girl\u2014you\u2019re cooking a good one there!\u201d He rubbed a big hand over her belly. \u201cPreacher, you dog\u2014you did fine work here!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I sure did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about to pop, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty soon,\u201d she said, grinning. \u201cHow\u2019s your wife doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s great,\u201d Zeke said. \u201cI thought I could sneak one more kid by her, but she says I\u2019m all done. I don\u2019t know what her hang-up is. We only have four. You think four is enough?\u201d he asked Paige.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s more than I\u2019m having.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you tricked her into that many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThe girl\u2019s been lightin\u2019 my fire for almost twenty years now\u2014since the first time I saw her in that cheerleading outfit.\u201d He whistled. \u201cThose pom-poms just knocked me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo say nothing of that short skirt,\u201d someone supplied.</p><p>\u201cAnd those itty-bitty panties,\u201d someone else remarked.</p><p>\u201cI am so cut off,\u201d Preacher grumbled.</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d Paige warned, though she couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Joe was next, hugging her, checking out the stomach. Right behind him, Josh. \u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Paige said. \u201cOne at a time! You guys,\u201d she happily admonished. This crowd of men, each one of them what would be called a man\u2019s man, so driven in the masculine pursuits of soldiering, hunting, fishing and the like, loved women, pregnant women especially, and the babies they brought. It was uncanny. And tremendous fun.</p><p>Doc turned up for his whiskey, the general and Tom finally came in. Jack pressed a beer into Tom\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the cop?\u201d the general asked with amusement. \u201cThis kid\u2019s underage!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get around that by giving it away,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIn fact, when this crowd\u2019s here, I end up giving away the bar!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, where\u2019s Rick?\u201d someone asked.</p><p>\u201cHe went over to Eureka to fetch Lizzie,\u201d Jack said. Then he grinned and added, \u201cWednesday.\u201d</p><p>The place was soon throbbing with the noise of men, and Paige made her escape, but not without the plans Joe brought. The barbecue was lit, the party spilled out onto the porch when Doc\u2019s old truck rumbled into town and stopped in front of Connie and Ron\u2019s corner store across the street. A hush fell over the crowd. The marines who hadn\u2019t already been outside quietly gathered there as Rick got out, helped his girl out to go visit her aunt and uncle, but not before pulling her to him for one last kiss. The moment their lips met, the marines sent up a wild cheer.</p><p>The couple bolted apart in surprise. Rick saw them and his face was split in a huge grin. The cheering and jeering continued and with his arm still around Lizzie\u2019s waist, he obliged the crowd by pulling her against him again to finish what he started. Then he let her go, gave her a little pat on the rump and sent her into her aunt\u2019s store.</p><p>Tom leaned toward Paul and said, \u201cI hope Brenda stays indoors until these whack jobs leave town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, don\u2019t worry, Tom. They wouldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo way. You\u2019re Army.\u201d He grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the same stuff, Tom.\u201d</p><p>To the welcoming cheers, Rick walked across the street and stopped in front of the bar\u2019s porch. \u201cYou guys are so frickin\u2019 rude,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cHey, jarhead,\u201d someone yelled. \u201cLast I heard, Eureka was only a couple hours away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake a stop or two, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks pretty loose to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on up here, pal\u2014we don\u2019t have much time before the invasion of women! I wanna hear about recon training. They scare you?\u201d Rick was asked.</p><p>\u201cThey did,\u201d he replied. \u201cReconnaissance rappelling looked like a suicide mission to me, but then I just couldn\u2019t stop doing it. It\u2019s such a rush. And I got pushed out of an airplane a few times\u2014that really turned me on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Zeke said, shaking his head. \u201cAirplanes make me throw up. Well, not regular airplanes. But when I\u2019m in one painted up in camouflage with about a hundred and fifty pounds of gear on my back, it just does something to my stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause you\u2019re a sissy,\u201d Rick said, laughing.</p><p>The next to arrive to a huge and affectionate welcome was Mel and Brie and Jack\u2019s babies. Jack took immediate charge of David, but couldn\u2019t hang on to him long as he was passed around and admired. Next came Vanni and her girlfriend Nikki. \u201cHey,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cIs this some kind of bachelor party?\u201d</p><p>Joe Benson was sitting up at the bar when these last two women walked in, and he was brought instantly off the stool and to his feet. Nikki, small and dark-haired with big dark eyes and a small pink mouth, knocked the wind out of him for the second time. He had to shake himself. He\u2019d met her briefly a couple of months ago and the memory hadn\u2019t let him go. There was something about her that made his mouth drop open and his eyes shine. He couldn\u2019t stop staring at her.</p><p>Paul hung on to little Matt for Vanni so she could be welcomed and introduce her maid of honor. Steaks were turned on the grill, salad tossed, potatoes baked, ears of corn buttered and some of Preacher\u2019s finest pies set out. There was feasting and laughter. Toasts were made to Rick, Tom and the wedding couple. Women disappeared to nurse babies and reappeared as the sun slowly set.</p><p>The general found Paul. \u201cYou ready to take the plunge, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I\u2019ve been ready for a long time. I promise you, I\u2019ll do right by her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt. Nice group of men you have at your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are, sir. The best. Thanks for making them welcome. Thanks for sharing Tom\u2019s going away with all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an honor, Paul. It\u2019s good for him to see this\u2014he\u2019ll have this in no time, a crowd of brothers, shoring him up. I\u2019m going to miss that boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all miss him, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019ll ever just call me Walt? Or even Dad?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Paul smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t know, sir. I think I\u2019d kind of miss the edge.\u201d</p><p>As the evening aged and dinner was done, Joe stepped out onto the porch, pulled a cigar out of his pocket and snipped the end. He struck a match against his shoe, when he heard a sound and looked up. Nikki was leaning on the porch railing. \u201cOh, sorry,\u201d he said, shaking out the match. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone was out here.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. It seemed a shy smile, maybe a sad smile. \u201cVanni\u2019s nursing the baby,\u201d she said, then looked upward again. \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure out what she saw in a little town like this. But then I had a look at this sky.\u201d</p><p>Joe stepped up beside her. \u201cIt\u2019s something, all right. Nikki, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And you\u2019re Joe. Paul\u2019s friend from Oregon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said with a smile. She remembered him. She remembered him? \u201cYou must be a city girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSan Francisco. What\u2019s Grants Pass like? Big? Small?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmall, but not this small. Twenty-three thousand, some of the most beautiful sunsets in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you lived there a long time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much all my life. I have a big family there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kids.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo wife.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cStill single?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDivorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. It\u2019s been a long time. You?\u201d</p><p>She looked away. \u201cSingle,\u201d she said. \u201cRecently broken up, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, then I\u2019m the one sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cHe must be an idiot.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHe is. You can have your cigar. It doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p><p>He slipped it into his pocket. \u201cIt\u2019ll keep. How long have you known Vanni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe started flying together eight years ago. She stopped flying when she got pregnant, so we don\u2019t see each other as often as we used to.\u201d She looked out at the sky again. \u201cThis is the second time I\u2019ve been her maid of honor. She promises it\u2019s the last.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think you can trust her on that. She can be yours next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that\u2019ll ever happen,\u201d she said, looking down.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re young. You even thirty yet? And beautiful. It\u2019s just a matter of days, probably.\u201d</p> <p>She just sighed. \u201cImagine, Vanni finding two wonderful guys like that in such a short period of time. You knew Matt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery slightly. We grew up in the same town but went to different schools, and I didn\u2019t serve with him. I met him through Paul later, after I started designing houses for Paul\u2019s company. If Matt was on leave, home for a visit, we\u2019d run into each other for a beer when he was out with Paul. Good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese all seem like good guys. Does this happen often? Gatherings like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt used to be a lot of hunting and fishing, but lately these old boys have been tying the knot a lot. First Jack, about two years ago. Then Preacher last year. Mike, just a few months ago. Now Paul. Bunch of bachelors who no one could catch, everyone real slow to find the right woman, then all of a sudden there\u2019s a rush on. The only one who found his girl real early was Zeke\u2014he\u2019s been married since he was about seven. Four kids. Now it looks like I\u2019m the last one left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all so good-looking. I mean, you\u2019re all so good-looking\u2014it\u2019s pretty amazing you weren\u2019t snapped up early.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat turned out to be my fatal mistake.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been divorced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver ten years,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ve recovered your bachelorhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess. Can I get you anything? Something to drink, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I think I\u2019ll just enjoy the stars.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMind if I enjoy the stars with you for a while?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She looked at him and tilted her head slightly. His question finally coaxed a smile out of her, a real one, and he thought, damn. This girl is beautiful. \u201cThat would be nice, Joe.\u201d</p><p>Jack was the first to leave when he noticed Mel was looking tired. He collected his son, said goodbye to his boys and took Mel out onto the porch. They passed Joe and Nikki and said good-night as they left. Next to leave was Brie, giving Mike a kiss good-night on the porch before walking across the yard to their RV. Paige disappeared for good as she tucked herself in with Christopher for the night\u2014advanced pregnancy requiring rest. Next was Vanessa, out on the porch looking for Nikki. \u201cHey, you can stay as long as you like\u2014there are plenty of people around to take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do that,\u201d Joe offered. \u201cI\u2019d be glad to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cA maid of honor\u2019s work is never done.\u201d</p><p>Finally it was the general and Tom. Rick walked outside with them. Tom shook his hand and said, \u201cCome out to the house tomorrow. Bring your girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I might just do that. But not till after the wedding. No way I can let Lizzie see a wedding.\u201d</p><p>By the time Rick walked back into the room, the tables were pushed together, the cards were out and the cigars were being snipped. \u201cGet over here, boy,\u201d Zeke said. \u201cGet out your money.\u201d</p> <p>Rick laughed. Someone pressed a cigar on him and he said, \u201cGod, do I have to smoke this ugly thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you get your money out, you can do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that much money, guys,\u201d he complained, but he was sitting down.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, kid. We\u2019ll take whatever you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>T he general\u2019s house was a busy place on Saturday. The nuptials were scheduled for 4:00 p.m. with a party to follow. Sunday night would belong to Tom, his family and his girl since he\u2019d be leaving early Monday morning.</p><p>Caterers arrived in the morning, setting up a trellis strung with white drape in the yard behind the house. Fifty folding chairs were unloaded, champagne chilled, flowers placed around the house and yard. Paul\u2019s family arrived just after noon and his mother gratefully took charge of Mattie so the bride could primp. The general was happy to host the Haggerty men and Tom out on the deck while activity around the house and yard kept them out of those regions.</p><p>The next to arrive was Shelby. She drove up from Bodega Bay. It hadn\u2019t been that long since her mother\u2019s passing, but she was already changed; she\u2019d dropped a few pounds, wore her shiny, honey-colored hair free, flowing down her back, and for the first time in years, she wore makeup. She looked so great that when Tom saw her, he grabbed her up in his arms and whirled her around, making her laugh. \u201cLook at you,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat have you done to yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI just have a little more time now, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that. You\u2019re looking hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, honey,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s nice. I\u2019ve never been hot in my life.\u201d</p><p>Next it was Paul to lift her off the ground and make a fuss over her, and finally she was pulled into the circle of women with Vanni exclaiming over how wonderful she looked. The only one not surprised was Walt, who\u2019d been making regular visits to Bodega Bay since his sister\u2019s passing. As they were getting the house back into shape he\u2019d been watching the slow and startling transformation of his niece as she found her footing, making her way into a new life.</p><p>Paul was showered before noon so he could clear out of the bathroom, finally putting on his suit at three, as did the best man and Walt. When the guests began to arrive, cold champagne was pressed into their hands as they were directed to the chairs in the yard. The minister, Harry Shipton of Grace Valley, was more than happy to accept his champagne with the rest of the gathering. Right at four, Vanessa and Nikki stepped out onto the deck from the house, making their way to the yard where the vows would be spoken.</p><p>Paul felt his knees almost buckle when he saw her. Now, he knew this was one fine-looking woman, and since he\u2019d been the best man at her last wedding, it wasn\u2019t as if he\u2019d never seen her all dressed up. But it felt like the first time. She was usually found in jeans or a simple sundress, and in those she was almost too much for his heart. Today she was resplendent in green so pale it was nearly white. It was a shimmering, clingy silk, her reddish-gold hair lying in full curls on her shoulders and down her back. Her turquoise eyes were alive with love, sparkling brightly, and her peach lips were curved in a smile.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cLook at my sister, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see her,\u201d Paul croaked. \u201cGod above.\u201d</p><p>Tom laughed. \u201cWell, go get her,\u201d he said, poking him in the ribs. \u201cGod, I hope I\u2019m cooler than you when I get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Paul said in a weak breath. He unstuck his rooted feet and went to collect his bride and bring her into the gathering. She was greeted with lots of hugs and kisses, a glass pressed into her hand. Paul\u2019s arm was around her waist and he couldn\u2019t make himself let her go. He felt his chest swell with cocky pride, having her at his side. No way he should be getting a woman who looked like this. And she was all his; she couldn\u2019t even glance at him without confirming that with her gaze.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get started, shall we?\u201d Harry asked, stepping up in front of the trellis.</p><p>Paul and Vanni went to stand before him, followed by Nikki and Tom.</p><p>Paul\u2019s eyes were riveted on his bride, but she was hardly the only beautiful woman present. Mel was looking very fine on this occasion, color in her cheeks again and that sparkle in her eyes. Paige was stunning in her last trimester of pregnancy, a glow around her as she clung to her husband\u2019s hand. Brie was a vision in lavender, her man reluctant to let very many inches separate them. Shelby was looking awful cute in a fitted pantsuit and heels to bring her up to five-five, her thick hair free and glorious, her smile bright.</p><p>And there was Nikki. The dark-haired beauty wore a closely fitting pale pink dress with a demure slit up one side, not visible unless a soft breeze caught the silk and lifted it. Her black hair fell down her back in a breathtaking contrast to the pastel. She wore a beautiful smile for her best friend\u2019s vows and had no idea how closely she was being watched.</p><p>The vows were exchanged quickly, without a single mistake, and it was finally time for Paul to take Vanni into his arms and cover her mouth with a searing kiss that suggested he wished they were alone. The gathering cheered and applauded the bride and groom until they had no choice but to break apart.</p><p>As the couple made their way slowly through the gathering and toward the house where the party was laid out for the celebrants, Joe saw his chance. He grabbed a glass of champagne off a tray and pressed his way toward Nikki. He offered it and said, \u201cYou look very beautiful today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, accepting the drink.</p><p>\u201cThere should be dancing at this party,\u201d he complained. \u201cOtherwise, how am I going to get my arms around you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you flirting with me?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI am. I think it\u2019s the dress.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing dress,\u201d he went on.</p><p>\u201cInto fashion, are you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t before today.\u201d He put out a hand to escort her. \u201cLet me take you to a party.\u201d</p><p>Not long after the food was put out, Walt realized he\u2019d misplaced Shelby. He looked around the house and yard and then, on an impulse, he went to the stable. He found her there, all dressed up and fancy, stroking Plenty\u2019s neck. She looked over her shoulder at her uncle and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve seen this girl.\u201d</p><p>He stepped toward her. \u201cLooks like she remembers you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but Liberty\u2019s as self-centered as he ever was. And I sure like this new guy, Chico. I can\u2019t wait to get back on a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where they are,\u201d he said. \u201cVisit us whenever you can. Ride. Enjoy the summer along the river. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole place is wonderful, Uncle Walt. It lives up to all the pictures you brought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a lucky man.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and leaned back against the stall. Plenty nuzzled her hair, making her laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have an extra bedroom when Tom\u2019s gone to boot camp and West Point,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to fill it up for you on weekends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love that, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni says Paul\u2019s building them a house. He\u2019s going to start right away\u2014try to get them in by Christmas even if there\u2019s still a lot of work to finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s his plan as I understand it.\u201d Walt chuckled. \u201cI think he\u2019s anxious to get his new wife out from under my roof.\u201d</p><p>Shelby stepped toward her uncle. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet what I\u2019m going to do next. Probably go back to school, but it\u2019s really too late for me to get accepted for the fall semester. Besides, I think I need a little more time to unwind. To think about what direction I might take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFortunately, you have lots of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to spend it here....\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened in disbelief. Hopefully, he said, \u201cDo you mean that, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be lonely without Tom. I can help with the horses.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and stroked her shiny hair. \u201cWhat about Bodega Bay?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to let it go,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure the work on the house gets finished, but I\u2019ve already talked to a Realtor. I\u2019m going to sell it, Uncle Walt. I think I want to move on. I don\u2019t think it will take longer than a couple of months to sell. It\u2019s a good little house.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t want to just rent it for a while? Keep a grip on it just in case you decide that\u2019s where you belong? You\u2019ve been there your whole life....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I think it\u2019s time for a new life. Don\u2019t you?\u201d She smiled. \u201cWhile I\u2019m thinking about where that new life is going to be, I\u2019d like to be here with you, with my family. If it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby, nothing would make me happier. Honey, I never even dared hope you would come here for a long stay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope you still feel that way when I\u2019ve been underfoot for a while. I\u2019m leaving early tomorrow, Uncle Walt. I\u2019m going to shop my way back to Bodega Bay. I haven\u2019t bothered with things like new clothes in years.\u201d Tears came into her eyes. \u201cDo you have any idea how happy that would make my mother?\u201d</p><p>Walt pulled her against him and held her. \u201cShelby, sweetheart, I have an awful lot to be proud of, but I don\u2019t think anyone in my life has made me prouder than I am of you. You\u2019re an amazing young woman.\u201d</p><p>Joe tried to keep tabs on Nikki throughout the party, even though she spent a great deal of time mingling among the guests. When it looked as if she wasn\u2019t engaged in conversation, he found a way to get next to her, ask her if she was having fun, how long she would stay in Virgin River, when did she have to get back to work\u2014anything that would keep her attention, keep her talking. Apparently he hadn\u2019t lost his touch; she seemed to enjoy his flirting.</p><p>He wondered what the hell was going on with him\u2014she wasn\u2019t typical of the sort of woman he was attracted to. No, it was leggy blondes he liked, and this woman was small with that long sheath of satiny black hair. Her waist was so tiny, he thought maybe he could get his hands around it. That pink mouth, the same color as the dress. Her ankles, narrow. Calves, slim but firm; tiny feet with pink toes. When did he start caring about ankles and toes? He watched her laugh, the way she tilted her head back, an action that sent ripples down her curtain of hair.</p><p>Joe was a little confused. When he developed one of those physical attractions, he couldn\u2019t seem to pull his eyes away from a woman\u2019s butt, her breasts, her thighs. This was a whole new thing\u2014the way she laughed, her little feet. It was nuts. It was like a schoolboy\u2019s crush.</p> <p>He kept watch, looking for a moment to spirit her out under the starlight, maybe steal a kiss or something, wondering why he would bother. First thing in the morning he was headed to Grants Pass and she would take off for San Francisco. Still, he watched her every move. When he saw her walk down the hall and slip into the room that had been given to her for her stay, he briefly gave up the vigil and went to the bar for a drink.</p><p>The hour was still early when some of the guests began to leave and Joe was caught up in saying goodbye to friends. \u201cI\u2019m going to open the bar for the guys who are staying over,\u201d Preacher told him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m just going to bunk in the trailer out front and leave first thing. I have some work to get done before Monday morning,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>The marines started to filter out, headed back into town, maybe thinking along the lines of cards, and Paul\u2019s family\u2014parents, brothers and their wives\u2014were going to drive as far as Fortuna to stay the night before going on to Oregon in the morning. Vanni and Paul would pass their wedding night right here, to spend as much time with Tom as possible before he left.</p><p>She was gone, Joe realized. The house was beginning to empty of guests, the night was dark but for a sliver of a moon and a billion stars, and the girl he\u2019d had a fix on all day was missing. He looked around the great room, the kitchen, and then, braving rejection, walked down the hall to her room. He tapped lightly on the door, but there was no answer. It was not gentlemanly, but he pushed open the door because he had to find her. She wasn\u2019t there. How\u2019d she get by him? There was no one in the hall bath; the door stood open. He had to at least get her phone number. He felt a trip to the Bay Area coming on.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Nikki?\u201d he asked Vanessa.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t. I thought maybe she turned in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she did,\u201d he lied. \u201cI just wanted to say good-night\u2014I\u2019ll probably be out of here real early in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Damn, he wasn\u2019t ready to give up on that one. He hadn\u2019t been drawn to a woman in a while, but this one had hooks in him like grappling. He wasn\u2019t exactly sure why, but it was fierce.</p><p>The party was dwindling to just a few people\u2014Rick and Tom and their girls, the bride and groom, the general, Mike and Brie, Shelby. The caterers were packing up and cleaning the kitchen. Joe stepped outside onto the now-dark deck. He took out a cigar, clipped the end, struck a match on his shoe\u2014and it illuminated her. She was standing at the far end of the deck, out of sight, out of the light from within the house, her back to him.</p><p>He started to get excited at having found her, feeling a crazy lift in his chest. The match burned down to his fingers and he shook it out with a muffled curse. He took a breath and walked up behind her. \u201cThe stars again?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d she said, her voice teary.</p><p>He slipped the cigar back into his shirt pocket and gently grabbed on to her upper arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. Then she sniffed.</p> <p>\u201cNothing? Fine but for the tears?\u201d He gave her arms a squeeze. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, now. I can\u2019t stand it when a woman cries. Wipes me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back inside,\u201d she whispered. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d he said, leaning toward her a little, inhaling her scent. \u201cI\u2019m kind of stuck here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go, okay? This is sort of embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>He turned her around slowly. He looked down into those dark, liquid eyes, a trace of tears on each cheek. \u201cAll this wedding crap, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Vanni to think I\u2019m not happy for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t think that. She\u2019d understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Paul why a woman as beautiful as you seems sad. Bad breakup, he said. I don\u2019t know the details, but I\u2019m sorry that happened. He\u2019s certifiable, the guy who let you go.\u201d He pressed his lips first against one of those tear tracks, then the one on the other cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I can think of is kiss the tears away. I don\u2019t want you to cry anymore, but if you do, I can take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t. We don\u2019t really know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been thinking all day\u2014we should get to know each other better.\u201d He put his hands on her waist. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering about this all day,\u201d he said. \u201cI can get my hands around your waist.\u201d He lowered his lips to hers, barely touching them. \u201cI think there was a small tear there,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was,\u201d he insisted. He put his lips there again. Barely touching. He ran his tongue along her upper lip. \u201cTear,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed and another tear squeezed out and ran down her cheek. He was right on it, kissing it dry. It took many soft kisses. \u201cNo one should make you cry like this. Tell me who he is. I\u2019ll kill him for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasted so much time on him,\u201d she said with a hiccup of emotion.</p><p>He kissed her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s a dick,\u201d he said. \u201cWorse. He\u2019s a stupid dick.\u201d</p><p>She responded with a small, whimpering laugh.</p><p>He pulled her closer, slipped his arms around her and lowered his head to kiss her neck.</p><p>\u201cThere are no tears there,\u201d she said in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI know that now,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you have any idea how good you smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I meant to smell this way,\u201d she said. Her hands were on his arms. Not embracing, but not pushing him away. \u201cDo you do this a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done this before,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a liar,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI bet you pick up girls all the time.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head. \u201cI try,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that often. And I swear, I have never found a beautiful woman crying over some jerk and kissed her tears away. Never. But I think I like it. And I\u2019m getting good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too bad,\u201d she said with a sigh, laying her head on his shoulder. \u201cFor an amateur.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNikki, you\u2019re beautiful and sexy. And funny. You shouldn\u2019t be treated badly by anyone. No one should make you cry. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I want you to be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m right.\u201d He touched her lips again, a little more firmly this time. He moved over them tenderly. \u201cI think you\u2019re starting to feel a little better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said, her eyes closing as she leaned into his kiss again.</p><p>Something happened inside Joe\u2019s head, inside his chest. There was a kind of lightness and fullness at the same time. He opened his lips as he kissed her, tasting her mouth, and she was delicious. In fact, she tasted even better than she smelled and he was falling headlong into her. Whoa, he thought. I\u2019m wanting this girl, this woman. I want the maid of honor. She opened her lips under his and allowed his tongue inside and it brought a thrilled, lusty moan from him. He held her close against him, probing the inside of her mouth. No way he was letting her go, now that he finally had her in his arms. Her arms went around his neck, yielding to the kiss, making small noises that were not associated with crying. He found himself thinking, Paul is going to kill me. I\u2019m thinking carnal thoughts about the maid of honor and how to get her out of this pink dress and Paul is going to kill me.</p><p>But I will die happy, he further thought.</p><p>He pulled away from her just a bit, whispering against her lips, \u201cThat\u2019s what you needed. You needed to be kissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe should be sure,\u201d he said, covering her mouth again. And again, tongues played, lips moved. He ran a hand down her hair and found it felt as soft as it looked\u2014pure silk. The softest thing he\u2019d ever touched. He scrunched up a handful at the base of her neck. \u201cGod,\u201d he whispered, in awe of the texture. \u201cGod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hardly know each other,\u201d she said again, but she said it while her lips were still in contact with his.</p><p>\u201cYeah...but that\u2019s a short-term problem. We\u2019re going to get to know each other lots better.\u201d</p><p>Like an answer to a prayer, she came to his lips with hunger, thrusting her small tongue inside, moaning softly as she did so. He ran his hand down to the small of her back and pulled her against him. He devoured her lips for a full minute, for two full minutes. Three. A light from the great room inside the house flicked off, leaving the deck that much darker and he became intoxicated with the taste of her, the feel of her small body molded to his. With a will of its own, his hand brushed against her breast and if he wasn\u2019t mistaken, she kissed him harder, deeper. He could feel an erect nipple under the silk of her dress and he ran his thumb over it, bringing a sigh from her. She didn\u2019t push his hand away. His lips slipped to her neck. \u201cYeah. You\u2019re starting to feel better I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Just a little.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold it back any longer; he was aroused. Erect. Damn. This was going to put him in a tough spot, because this reaction always made it a lot more difficult to think straight. It was a real challenge to be sensible. Logical. Thoughts of Paul killing him for making love to the maid of honor fled from his mind, replaced with obsessive thoughts of what his lips around that nipple would feel like. He lowered his head to check. He was absolutely right\u2014it felt perfect. Even through the dress. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t get any more worked up,\u201d she said in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d he replied, but he was agonizingly unable to lift his head. He was busy putting small kisses on her breast, her neck, her shoulder. He ran a hand down her back, over her bum, down her thigh. He accidentally found that slit in her dress and before he knew it, his hand was inside. \u201cOh God, Nikki. I\u2019m a dead man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not doing too bad for a corpse,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cNikki, you have no panties on, and I\u2019m a dead, dead man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take your hand out of there,\u201d she advised breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cI. Can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He put his lips back on hers for a long, deep, wet kiss that lasted two minutes at least. But, he proudly thought, he was somehow able to keep his hand from wandering any farther than her naked bum. One large hand on one small, round, perfect cheek. He had cast a mental image of Crazy Glue holding him there, because if he slid it any farther south all the blood would drain from his brain and he would faint. And then came the danger zone. She pressed against him, rubbed against him. She gyrated her hips a little and moaned softly. She knew he was hard and ready to burst. She knew he knew she knew. He lifted his head. \u201cNikki. Let\u2019s,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s make love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow tacky is that? The maid of honor having sex with a marine on the deck?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled in spite of himself. \u201cI\u2019ll take you somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy that time, I will have come to my senses,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not far. I drag my bedroom around with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Talk about always being prepared...\u201d</p> <p>He kissed her again. Hot and hard kisses that lasted forever. \u201cIt\u2019s not really mine. I borrowed it from Paul. There aren\u2019t exactly rooms to rent around here....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat funny little trailer?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cThe door locks,\u201d he said against her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s very comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d she said, pushing him away a little bit. \u201cI haven\u2019t ever\u2014I mean, I\u2019m no nun, but I\u2019ve never done anything like this. This one-night stand thing. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not, I don\u2019t think,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d she said, yielding to his lips again.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to bother saying something that was just going to sound like a line, even if it seemed entirely true. He felt something. He\u2019d been feeling it since the moment he saw her in the bar with Vanni a while back, felt it again the second time he saw her, had been feeling it all day today and he had absolutely no idea what it was. But it sure didn\u2019t feel as if he was going to be cured of it in one night. \u201cIt\u2019s just the first night,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTalk me into it,\u201d she pleaded.</p> <p>\u201cNo. No way,\u201d he answered, pulling away a little. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you. If you want me to, I\u2019ll make love to you. If you don\u2019t, I can step away right now.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be easy, but I could let go of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what will people think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, people don\u2019t have to know if you don\u2019t want them to. This\u2014it\u2019s just about you and me. It only matters what you think, what you want. Don\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d He made a derisive sound deep in his throat. \u201cThat was really hard advice to give, by the way.\u201d</p><p>She answered by kissing him deeply, pressing her body up against his, and he was only further weakened. Or maybe he was further strengthened, because he was feeling more and more sure that he had to have this woman next to him, in his arms, in his life. There was some terrible curse on this place that turned fine, upstanding, confirmed bachelors into ridiculous, desperate men who tripped over a pretty girl and began to instantly think life would not go on if they didn\u2019t have her forever. They hadn\u2019t even been intimate and he already couldn\u2019t imagine letting her go. He tried to tell himself that by morning that feeling, that compulsion would be gone, but he doubted it. He\u2019d wanted before, but he couldn\u2019t remember wanting like this. Like he was drugged. Like he was glazed over and totally out of his mind for this one person.</p><p>She pulled away. \u201cI want to,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She drew a ragged breath. \u201cI\u2019m really sure.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at her, took her hand in his, and they walked down the steps into the yard and around the house, stopping every few feet to embrace, to kiss and fondle. And then he opened the door to that funny little trailer.</p><p>It was a little awkward at first, stepping up into that tiny trailer, because Joe was tearing the place apart looking for a condom. And she asked him, hadn\u2019t he brought any? And he told her he never expected something like this to come up while he was in Virgin River. \u201cWe usually just hunt. Play poker. Drink a little too much.\u201d And then he found a box of condoms in the drawer under the microwave and said, \u201cAh! God bless Paul.\u201d</p><p>After that discovery, the awkwardness passed as he began to seduce her and became seduced by her. There was nothing under that pink dress but Nikki, and she was exquisite\u2014tiny, firm, beautiful, sensual. Despite his condition, which was one of being so worked up and turned on he was afraid he might embarrass himself, he managed to make a decent study of her body and make long, slow, delicious love to her. Love that he was sure was completely satisfying to her as well as him.</p><p>Then they lay in each other\u2019s arms and talked for a while. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me about him, I don\u2019t want to know. But tell me more about you. Where you came from, what you like to do, how you want to spend the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>He learned that she had grown up in the city, gone to private schools, disappointed her parents by choosing to fly as a cabin attendant rather than becoming a neurosurgeon or astronaut or something. She liked to travel, ride horses, read. She was a good cook. What she wanted was to have a family, which was why she ended up with this guy who finally made it clear he was completely opposed to that idea. She had no idea it was really going to come to that. \u201cWhoops,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that might\u2019ve been about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d he forgave. \u201cLet\u2019s put him away for now.\u201d And he made love to her again.</p><p>There was something about loving her that surpassed the sex. He could easily move her around, she was so light, and as he did so, he forgot that he had been dying to experience her. The only important thing became her pleasure, giving her everything he had. Working her up, getting her so hot she was begging. Long, slow, deep strokes that made her sigh and moan. And when she let him know it was time, deep and strong thrusts that made her gasp and hold him tightly to her. When her orgasm came, he felt proud, as if he\u2019d taken good care of her. Maybe it was her response to him, the way she was swept away, her release leaving her breathless and gasping. If he had anything to say about it, this would go on forever and she would never be disappointed in his arms, in his life.</p><p>What he hadn\u2019t been prepared for was how loving and sexual she was toward him, acting as if his pleasure was the most important thing as well. Unwilling to lie back and receive his lovemaking, he felt her lips on every inch of his body; she pushed him back on that small bed and tortured him so beautifully it almost brought tears to his eyes. She was a woman who could give as good as she got and it filled him up with emotion so strong, he was sure he\u2019d never felt that way before.</p><p>And again they talked\u2014this time about Joe and his small town up north, the houses he designed, the Marine Corps and the friends for life he\u2019d made. He told her all about his Virgin River experiences, including the first time Jack called on the boys to help him clear the woods of dangerous men, to the time they\u2019d come together to help Paul lay his best friend to final rest.</p><p>Then more love. Deeply satisfying, wondrous, phenomenal love. Joe honestly didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d suddenly become better at making love than he realized or if this woman, Nikki, was simply so astonishing, she made him look good. So responsive, so sweet. It didn\u2019t matter to him\u2014he was sublimely grateful for every orgasm she had, and more grateful that he was able to give her more than he took for himself.</p><p>\u201cNikki,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI think finding you was the luckiest day of my life.\u201d</p><p>Then they talked about the others. Not the one who was making her cry, because Joe didn\u2019t want any more crying. Since stepping into that funky little trailer, there hadn\u2019t been any tears. Soft laughter, whispers, deep sighs, no tears. They talked about the other ones that just didn\u2019t work out, starting with his year-long marriage at the age of twenty-five. \u201cShe left you?\u201d Nikki asked, as though stunned.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cIt killed me.\u201d</p><p>Joe told her he\u2019d always been kind of prepped for marriage and family, given his parents\u2019 long marriage, the successful marriages of two brothers and one sister. And maybe he was gun-shy, that he hadn\u2019t fallen in love again after that. He was surprised to find himself this old and still unattached; he thought he\u2019d be settled and have a couple of kids by now. Once he saw some of his buddies find it late, he had renewed hope that maybe it wasn\u2019t outside the realm of possibility for him.</p><p>Nikki, it turned out, had had an affair or two go south before the one who made her cry. She dated an airline captain for a while without realizing he was actually married. And then, to her supreme embarrassment, she continued with him for a while after knowing. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking,\u201d she said, but she\u2019d been really young then. \u201cI regretted that, you can\u2019t imagine how much. He\u2019s been with quite a few single women since, though still married.\u201d</p><p>Lots of intimate talk, lots of wonderful, sweet but powerful sex. The sun was starting to peek over the mountains when Joe nodded off with Nikki close in his arms. It was high up when he heard the sound of an engine and bolted upright, finding the bed beside him empty. He couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d sneak away without saying goodbye. Then it occurred to him she might\u2019ve escaped into the house, into her guest room, to keep her private life private from her hosts.</p><p>He dressed, shaved, ran a comb through his hair and hoped to meet her at the coffeepot in the general\u2019s kitchen. He had to get with her one more time to plan their next meeting, to tell her he wanted to call her, talk to her, find out when she would allow him to come to the Bay Area. He was already missing the sound of her voice. The smell of her skin.</p><p>When he got into the house, he found Vanni in the kitchen, the baby in his bouncy seat on the table. \u201cMorning,\u201d he said, headed for the coffeepot. When he got back to the table and sat, he was met by her glare. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, perplexed.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you did that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDid what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMy best friend. You know she\u2019s been through a hard time.\u201d</p><p>He looked around a little frantically. \u201cVanni, what? Where\u2019s Nikki?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d he asked, rising out of his chair. \u201cGone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she affirmed. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>He gave a huff of unhappy laughter. \u201cI was thinking I\u2019d just found the woman of my dreams,\u201d he said. \u201cShe left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn tears,\u201d Vanni said, her mouth set in a grim line.</p><p>\u201cTears? Vanni, I did not make her cry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you have sex with her all night long in that little fifth wheel?\u201d she asked, anger in her tone.</p><p>Hoo-boy. You don\u2019t talk about that, especially when it\u2019s meaningful. \u201cVanni, I swear to you, I didn\u2019t do anything to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you find her on the deck, crying, and kiss her and seduce her and take her to that little trailer?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell...Yeah...I did that part....\u201d And he was thinking, was there a felony in there somewhere? Because all through the night the only thing he had tried to do was show her how much she could be loved. And it was wonderful; she was wonderful. Spontaneous and aroused and ultimately quite satisfied. And happy. He\u2019d heard her sigh, he\u2019d heard her laugh. There was absolutely no crying.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t it occur to you that after her heart had been broken, that was probably not a great idea?\u201d</p><p>He got a little angry himself. He leaned his hands on the table, got a little bit in her face and said, \u201cNo. I thought it was a terrific idea, and so did she. I wanted to be good to her and I was. I treated her with absolute respect, and she consented one hundred percent. Now, give me her number. I need to talk to her as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe said absolutely no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, I have to get in touch with her. Vanni, this isn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. I just don\u2019t know what went through your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute here, I didn\u2019t talk her into anything! I was a perfect gentleman, I swear to God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know anything about women?\u201d she asked him.</p> <p>\u201cApparently not!\u201d he answered hotly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just spent five years with a guy who wouldn\u2019t come through. What do you suppose she thinks you\u2019re going to do after one night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could give me a frickin\u2019 chance!\u201d</p><p>Vanni\u2019s mouth was set in a firm line. \u201cShe said absolutely no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake. Vanni, this is cruel and unusual. Listen, I have feelings for her. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter one night?\u201d she asked, a definite superior tone to her voice.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the night,\u201d he said. \u201cWill you ask her to call me? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew her for what? Ten minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay, it was fast. Okay? I admit it. But by the time we\u2019d spent a night together it seemed...\u201d It seemed as if he\u2019d been with her for years! Jesus, his voice was quivering. He was losing his mind. He should be saying, fine\u2014if that\u2019s the way she wants it, fine. But in his head, his heart, his gut, he was feeling desperate. Driven. He was not letting this woman get away.</p><p>His good sense said give it up. She\u2019s a nutcase. A whole night of magnificent love, intimate talk, something deep and meaningful going on and she splits? Like that? Never wanting to hear from you again? Give it up. Let it go. Move on. She\u2019s probably crazy. Joe had had one or two crazy women for excruciating but short duration, and he didn\u2019t want another one.</p><p>But he said, \u201cVanni, I have to talk to her. I won\u2019t do to her whatever he did to her. I won\u2019t make any promises I can\u2019t keep and I never did or said anything that wasn\u2019t a hundred percent sincere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201d he answered. \u201cWhere is your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t do you any good,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s under orders.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>She inclined her head toward the stable.</p><p>He left his coffee on the table and made fast tracks for the stable. Hadn\u2019t they all just had a perfectly nice wedding and reunion? He had no idea what had gone wrong. It had been the luckiest chance meeting of his life\u2014that beautiful, sexy, soft and sweet Nikki had been there. And she had opened herself up to him in ways that led him to believe she found it to be her luckiest chance meeting as well. In his mind everything had gone right and could reasonably lead to many days, weeks, months, years of more nice stuff. He knew he had to invest the time before he could get a clear picture of the future\u2014he\u2019d been as burned as Nikki had\u2014but you don\u2019t bolt when things are going right. And he looked forward to nothing so much as investing the time. With her.</p><p>He found Paul and Tom brushing down horses in the stable. He stopped short and took a few deep breaths. \u201cHey, boys,\u201d he said. \u201cTom, you mind? Can I have a minute with Paul? I\u2019ll take your brush if you want.\u201d</p><p>Tom looked at him grimly, though there might\u2019ve been a little sparkle in his eye. \u201cI heard you did the maid of honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Joe said somewhat irritably, \u201cI was busy keeping private things private. I thought she might\u2019ve appreciated that.\u201d</p><p>Tommy grinned. \u201cI\u2019d congratulate you, man, but I think you blew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m hearing. But if you\u2019d been there...\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinky,\u201d Tom said. \u201cSure I can\u2019t stay? You could think of it as part of my education.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake off,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cKilljoy,\u201d he said, passing Joe the brush and leaving the stable.</p><p>\u201cYou gotta help me, man,\u201d Joe said to Paul. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to her. I mean, I only did to her what she totally...She should not have left in tears. I swear to God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Yet, she did. She was all shook up. Vanni was worried about her driving like that\u2014all messed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you have to understand. I\u2014\u201d He stopped. He didn\u2019t like the desperate sound of his own voice. He was not going to do this\u2014he was not going to tell Paul that he held her and loved her all night long and that he was gentle and she was sweet. That they had also been a little wild\u2014beautifully wild. That their bodies had meshed perfectly and their words just as well. That in addition to sex too hot to imagine, there had been tender words, too soft and lovely to explain. He couldn\u2019t tell a guy that. It was beyond him.</p><p>\u201cPaul, goddammit, you have to help me with this. I have to get in touch with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says she doesn\u2019t want to hear from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to hear that from her. Jesus, I don\u2019t even know her last name.\u201d</p><p>Paul stopped brushing and looked at Joe over the rear end of a horse. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d admit that again.\u201d He groaned. \u201cJesus, Joe. You screwed the maid of honor without even getting her name?\u201d</p><p>Joe lost it. He dropped the brush, grabbed Paul by the front of his shirt and slammed him up against the stable wall with a huge bang. Paul could easily have hammered him if he wasn\u2019t so completely shocked. \u201cI didn\u2019t do that,\u201d Joe said in a fierce, angry whisper. \u201cI didn\u2019t screw anyone! I made excellent love to her and she made incredible love right back to me and it was almost too good to believe. I used six of your condoms and I\u2014\u201d He stopped. He let go of Paul and stepped back. \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening to me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI think you might be a little out of control,\u201d Paul observed.</p><p>\u201cAw, come on! Help me out here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d admit again that you don\u2019t even know her last name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is it, you jerk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJorgensen, but you didn\u2019t hear it from me. Okay? I\u2019d like to have sex again in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex. Sex. It\u2019s all about sex.\u201d Joe shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly about half the time,\u201d Joe said. \u201cPaul, will you listen to me a second? It was perfect\u2014the kind of perfect that just doesn\u2019t come along very often. You hear me? It was wonderful. It wasn\u2019t just sex, but don\u2019t get me wrong...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going down the wrong road again, buddy. Women don\u2019t want to hear about how great they were in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re an expert? Married twelve hours and you know everything?\u201d He hung his head. \u201cI have to find her, man. She gets two chances\u2014she has to tell me twice that it\u2019s nothing. Twice. Then I go away quietly. I\u2019m no stalker. But man...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew. You got it bad,\u201d Paul said. \u201cShe is way under your skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, Paul. You of all people.\u201d</p><p>Paul was quiet for a minute. \u201cUnfortunately, I read you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me out here. She\u2019s...Don\u2019t make me say anything more, please. It\u2019s private, okay? Help me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019d do. Write her a letter,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Vanni to send it to her. But I can\u2019t guarantee anything,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cYou are so frickin\u2019 whipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What are you right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of my head, that\u2019s what.\u201d</p><p>Paul lifted two eyebrows. \u201cSix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, bite me!\u201d</p><p>Before leaving Virgin River, Joe sat in the fifth wheel he\u2019d borrowed and wrote a letter on a lined yellow pad, a letter in which every word embarrassed him. But he forced himself. He went through roughly fifty drafts to come up with one he could live with, and he still found it horribly inadequate.</p><p>Nikki\u2014</p><p>I had a wonderful weekend with you. You left too soon and broke my heart. I want to talk to you again, see you again, and according to Vanni, you don\u2019t want to be contacted by me. I don\u2019t know what went wrong. For me, everything went right, and I thought it went right for you, too. I know you\u2019re still recovering from a bad breakup, but it didn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with you and me. Call me. Tell Vanni to give me your number so I can call you. I hope I didn\u2019t do or say anything to hurt you, to make you feel bad, but if I did, at least give me a chance to apologize. Nikki, it was one of the nicest weekends of my life. Come on, baby. I\u2019m dying here.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Joe.</p><p>He gave the letter to Paul because he didn\u2019t trust Vanni just yet. However, when he took Vanessa into his arms to give her a kiss goodbye he said, \u201cYou have to believe me. I didn\u2019t hurt her. I want to hear from her. Please, tell her that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her. But I don\u2019t know that it\u2019ll change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell her. Please.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>T om had his gear packed by Sunday afternoon. He took Brenda out for a long ride and she held it together real well. She stayed for dinner with the general, Vanni and Paul. His dad was taking him to the bus at five in the morning. He drove Brenda back to her house at about 8:00 p.m., but he didn\u2019t get home until 4:00 a.m. He found his dad was up.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t keep Brenda out all this time, did you, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad. We were at her house. Her parents were home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019ll be okay. You haven\u2019t been up all night, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn and off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you weren\u2019t worried,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cNot at all, son. I knew you\u2019d be with your girl to the last minute. Unfortunately for you, there\u2019s no time to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be.\u201d He draped an arm around his son\u2019s shoulder, gave a squeeze and said, \u201cIt\u2019s what I would\u2019ve done, too. She\u2019s a wonderful girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a wonderful girl,\u201d Tom agreed, a sadness at leaving her in his voice.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you some breakfast. Maybe a shower. Then we\u2019ll take off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni and Paul getting up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure. Come on, kid.\u201d</p><p>Walt scrambled eggs and fried bacon and the sounds from the kitchen brought the others. An hour later they all stood out on the front porch and said goodbye. Tom kissed his sister and little Mattie. While his dad waited in the car, he embraced Paul. \u201cWatch out for my dad, Paul,\u201d Tom said. \u201cHe likes to act like this is no big deal. Be sure he\u2019s handling me being gone okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll watch,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of your family, boy. You just knock \u2019em dead in boot camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ricky\u2019s time was spent with the four most important people in his life. His grandma, Lydie, his girl, Liz, Jack and Preacher. Liz stayed in Virgin River for the ten days he was on leave and some afternoons, Jack took him fishing.</p><p>Standing out in the Virgin with Jack, watching the lines arc over their heads as they cast, Rick felt it was where he had always belonged. It was here, at the river, that all the important growing-up talks of his life had taken place, and always with Jack. It was here that Jack had that big talk with him about sex, for what good it did\u2014Rick had still ended up getting his girl pregnant. What a tough time that had been. Later, while Rick was doing his best to stand by her like a man, it was Jack who encouraged him, coached him, tried to keep him on the right path to avoid even more disaster. And after the baby was stillborn, Jack and Preach held him up, helped him shoulder the pain.</p><p>\u201cThanks for everything you\u2019ve done for me, Jack,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. People tend to come out to celebrate their friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about this week\u2014which, by the way, has been great. I was talking about the last few years. You were like my dad. I kind of always thought of you as my dad. I hope you don\u2019t mind that too much.\u201d</p><p>Jack felt his chest tighten up. \u201cMind? That would make me damn proud, Rick. If I could have another son, I would have it be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gotta do something for me, Jack. If anything goes wrong over there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick. We don\u2019t like to talk that way....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJack! We know what it is over there. Now listen, if anything goes wrong over there, will you make sure my grandma and Lizzie get through it okay?\u201d</p><p>Jack looked at him, at his profile, because Rick looked straight ahead. \u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to ask that. We take care of each other\u2019s families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And, Jack? I just don\u2019t want to leave anything important unsaid. I love you, man. You\u2019re my best friend ever. You got me grown up. Nothing would\u2019ve turned out without you.\u201d</p><p>Jack swallowed. When he spoke, his voice wasn\u2019t real strong. \u201cThere\u2019s still lots of fishing to do, Rick. I\u2019m counting on that.\u201d He put his hand on the boy\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI love you, too, son.\u201d But he was thinking, If you don\u2019t come back, who\u2019s going to get me through it?</p><p>\u201cI want to tell you something I did. I know I\u2019m only nineteen, Liz only seventeen\u2014both of us still too young. But I bought her a necklace with a diamond in it\u2014a nice-size one, too. I told her it was my promise to her, but I also told her it didn\u2019t hold her to anything.\u201d</p><p>Jack lifted an eyebrow. \u201cBig step,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHalf a step, really,\u201d Rick said. \u201cCall it a first step. I love the girl, there\u2019s no question about that. I\u2019ve loved her since she was fourteen\u2014it was my undoing. But there were so many complications for us, some real hurting times. If there\u2019s a better guy for her, I won\u2019t hold her back. But if there\u2019s not a better guy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what, Rick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m driving her crazy, talking about school all the time. She\u2019s gotta finish high school\u2014that\u2019s just one more year. And I\u2019d really like her to get a little college\u2014I asked her to at least try. When I\u2019m done with this gig, I\u2019m going to school. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll give up the Marine Corps\u2014I don\u2019t know about that yet\u2014but I\u2019m going to college. If it works out for us, if we get married, I want us to be smart, educated people. I want a family real bad\u2014probably because of the one we lost, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that would set up a real strong desire, yeah,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cWell, if I get another chance at that, I\u2019d like us to be smart enough to earn a decent living and have a couple of kids raised by educated parents.\u201d He turned and grinned at Jack. \u201cI think that kind of talk got her attention\u2014she said she\u2019d try to get good grades her senior year and she\u2019d at least go to community college.\u201d He sobered. \u201cShe said she\u2019d do that so I\u2019d be proud of her. Man, I\u2019m already so proud of her\u2014look how she holds up, huh? She buried her baby and said goodbye to me, and did she fall apart? She\u2019s been solid. She\u2019s been real brave, real strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou both have, Rick. A diamond, huh? How\u2019d you save enough for a diamond?\u201d</p><p>Ricky laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not doing that anymore, buying things like that with my per diem\u2014I\u2019ll save it for something a little more practical, like a down payment on a house or a car. But Liz deserved to have something beautiful that says I love her, that I couldn\u2019t think more of her. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>It made Jack smile. \u201cYou think she stood by you while you were gone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvery day,\u201d he said. \u201cShe gets real lonesome sometimes, and she misses all the stuff the girlfriends do\u2014homecoming dance, prom, all that stuff. I told her to go\u2014I could deal with that. But she said she couldn\u2019t do that. It might lead someone on. She said if she\u2019s still with me in the end, that stuff wouldn\u2019t even be important. She writes me letters almost every day\u2014longer ones when everyone but her is going to prom. Damn...There are a lot of times I wish I was more like you\u2014totally free and not caring about any woman until I\u2019ve had a chance to really live, see the world, experience the world\u2014and then have Liz come along later, when I\u2019m like thirty, or forty...\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cAnd there are a lot of times I wish I\u2019d met Mel a long time before she\u2019d hooked into that first husband, started our family when we were both a lot younger, before I started getting gray. I think if you\u2019re lucky enough to find the right person at all, you don\u2019t have a right to complain about when, how.\u201d He put a hand on the kid\u2019s shoulder and gave a squeeze. \u201cI hope it works out for the two of you, son. You buried a baby together. It would be sweet if you could bring a couple of healthy and strong ones into your lives together. But I\u2019ll say this\u2014I think you\u2019re smart to tell her to take her time on that commitment. Believe me, when you make those kinds of promises to a woman, you want her to be absolutely sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I think.\u201d</p><p>A large fish jumped across the river and they were silent; he was huge. \u201cKing,\u201d Rick finally said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen one that size in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be lost,\u201d Jack said, casting in that direction.</p><p>Rick took a few paces downstream, changed out his fly and threw a line. They played with him a while, then Rick hooked him and yelled, \u201cWoo-hoo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLead him, let him take out line, tire him out before you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rick laughed. \u201cI know how to catch a fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t screw around, get too anxious and lose him,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYou milking this cow?\u201d Ricky asked him.</p><p>For the better part of an hour Rick played him, letting out line, letting him run, pulling him back, walking up and down in the shallow part of the river when the fish ran, and all the while he had Jack in his ear. \u201cThat son of a bitch is big. Let out more line. Don\u2019t spoil him, he\u2019s a fighter. He\u2019s getting too far from your control, reel him back.\u201d And on and on and on.</p><p>Rick finally brought him in, a great big Chinook, over thirty pounds. And that was more than enough fishing; Rick\u2019s ears were ringing from Jack\u2019s mother-henning.</p><p>When they got back to the bar, Preacher whistled in admiration and loaded the fish on the scale. \u201cThirty-seven point four. You catch him all by yourself, Rick?\u201d</p><p>Rick made a face at Jack. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>When Jack took Rick to Garberville, they sat in the truck for a minute, waiting for the bus to board. \u201cGot any last-minute advice?\u201d Rick asked him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Trust your gut. Follow your orders, but trust your instincts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to know that I\u2019m not afraid of it. I\u2019m not. In fact, I might be a little excited. It was the right thing to do, Jack. For me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take good care of Mel and the kids, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet I will. I\u2019ll write every week,\u201d Jack said. \u201cNothing will happen in Virgin River that you won\u2019t hear about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoopee,\u201d he said, and laughed. Jack went to tousle his hair the way he used to, but it was shaved down so short, he knuckled his scalp instead. \u201cI\u2019m going now,\u201d Rick said.</p><p>Jack got out of the truck and met him around the front. He gave him a robust hug. \u201cTake care, son. Be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Now you get outta here. Don\u2019t hang around and stare at the bus, like you did last time.\u201d</p><p>Jack couldn\u2019t stop himself\u2014he grabbed him and hugged him again. \u201cThis time next year, Rick. I\u2019ll get the boys to come. You bring your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. Then he turned and walked to the bus, straight and tall, his duffel over his shoulder. He never turned around to look back.</p><p>June grew old and hot. Small fires dotted a mountainous landscape that had remained dry and dangerous, while in Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Utah several big fires had threatened to run out of control and, it being early in the season, this didn\u2019t bode well. Northern California had escaped the big ones so far, but it was a frightening prospect as the rains continued to elude them. Cal Fire and Department of Forestry was patrolling campgrounds like crazy, making sure fires were only lit in designated areas and with permits, in many cases prohibiting fires of any kind.</p><p>Mel was keeping a very close eye on her husband. The first days after Ricky left found Jack a little on the quiet side, but he was coming around. He talked about the young man a lot, read the newspapers and had a satellite TV installed in the bar so he and Preacher could keep up on CNN reports of the war. He had the Chinook mounted, taking down his big, ugly sturgeon and replacing it with Rick\u2019s fish. He had also written about a dozen letters already, and let her read over some of them while they were in progress. \u201cJack,\u201d she had said, laughing. \u201cDo you really think Ricky cares what Preacher made for dinner, or how many temper tantrums Davie threw today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he wants to hear everything. I remember.\u201d</p><p>Of course he did, she thought. He remembered every long night he spent in battle zones, often in the same landscape, the same country where Rick served this very minute. He remembered every face of a young marine, every wounded man, every letter from home. For Jack to have been through it himself and let Rick go with such pride and confidence made him, in Mel\u2019s mind, the strongest man alive.</p><p>\u201cI have an idea,\u201d she told him. \u201cGo ask your sister and brother-in-law if they know any news that should be sent Rick\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes briefly widened, then he walked briskly out the back door of the bar, across the yard to that RV, and banged on the door. Mel watched from the window as Brie stepped outside. A short conversation ensued and then she could hear her husband\u2019s loud whoop of excitement just as he lifted his sister off her feet and swung her around and around. Then he was back, lifting Mel off her feet, bringing her face up to his. He covered her mouth in a searing, demanding kiss\u2014but she found herself laughing against his lips. \u201cJack, she\u2019s pregnant, not me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost as good,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want a baby so much. This is wonderful news.\u201d Then he scowled a little bit and said, \u201cDid you just leak some confidential medical information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cBrie said I could tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was much more fun. Are you done kissing me already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I want to way more than kiss you. I\u2019ll be very careful. How about it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She played with the hair at his temple. Not many women knew what it was like to have a man like this. A powerful and lusty man like Jack. He always put her needs and feelings ahead of his own, always looking to care for her in every way, keeping her safe, making sure she knew how loved she was. How wanted. In his love, in his arms, she always felt beautiful and sexy. Desired. Cherished. She kissed him on the lips and said, \u201cLater. And you don\u2019t have to be all that careful\u2014I\u2019m all right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your poor little body has been through so much,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJohn Stone was just here this morning, so he gave me a little check. I have my operator\u2019s license back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby,\u201d he said in a breath.</p> <p>\u201cBut, Jack, you are not to write Rick about that!\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her and said, \u201cJust as well. I could never put it into words, what I feel with you.\u201d</p><p>This was a kind of union Mel hadn\u2019t even dared fantasize. The level of their intimacy, from the physical to emotional, was so deep and intense, it was impossible for either of them to tell where one ended and the other began. She could read his mind; he could sense her feelings. They anticipated each other in so many ways. It was as if his heart beat in her breast. She had never known another human being as she knew her Jack. And she made herself just as accessible to him, holding nothing back.</p><p>As July arrived, Paige\u2019s time grew near. Mel was checking her by the week and she was progressing normally, ready for labor anytime. She had decided to have her baby at Doc\u2019s because her small quarters weren\u2019t really conducive to a home birth. And there was Christopher, only four. Lots of Mel\u2019s rural patients had children around during deliveries; they\u2019d come from families who had been having home births for generations and it was all part of the life cycle to them. For Paige and Preacher, however, this was a very new thing. In fact, Mel would have expected her to choose Valley Hospital and a sterile labor-and-delivery wing. But Paige was very determined\u2014the only person who could deliver her was Mel.</p><p>Joe Benson was putting the plans together for Brie and Mike\u2019s house, Paige and Preacher\u2019s add-on. He also had some preliminary sketches ready to show Paul for his house, but felt hesitant. Since the incident with Nikki, their relationship was strained. Vanni seemed to be over her anger with Joe, but Joe wasn\u2019t nearly over his disappointment in all of them. He supposed it would just take time.</p> <p>What he would\u2019ve liked was a little support. Maybe they could have gone to bat for him with the woman. Let her know that Joe was an okay guy, that he didn\u2019t use and abuse women. Reassure her, maybe. Encourage her to at least get in touch with him. To maybe take a chance on him.</p><p>Joe hadn\u2019t talked to Paul or Vanni about Nikki for a while. What he had done, however, was send notes to Vanni for Nikki about every other day, hoping to break through the barrier. Short, one-or two-sentence notes. \u201cPlease call me, Nikki. I want a chance to show you I\u2019m a decent guy.\u201d \u201cCall me or write me and tell me you are absolutely not interested in seeing me again\u2014but don\u2019t do this. Don\u2019t ignore me.\u201d \u201cI care. I thought it was clear in my actions that I\u2019m sincere.\u201d It took him a while to make himself stop; he began to feel like an idiot. And the more like an idiot he felt, the worse his mood. He hadn\u2019t been passing notes like that since he was totally, insanely, ridiculously in love with Jodie Ferguson in the fourth grade. Blond, brilliant, distant Jodie\u2014the first girl to get boobs in his class.</p><p>Although he had managed to kick his habit of note writing, he found a Nicole Jorgensen in the San Francisco phone directory and when he called that number, the voice on the answering machine was unmistakably hers. \u201cAh, Nikki, it\u2019s Joe. From Grants Pass. I\u2019d love to talk to you. No, I really need to talk to you. Please. I\u2019ve been trying to reach you since the wedding. Come on, Nikki, we have things to talk about. I\u2019m totally confused.\u201d</p><p>Of course she didn\u2019t call. Fortunately he left only the one message. It took great restraint on his part not to call that number several more times, just to hear the sound of her voice. That sweet, sultry voice that had caressed his mind with every word that had come out of her mouth. But her caller ID would show repeated attempts, making him look out of control, so he held himself back.</p><p>It had been a few weeks. He was done. No more note writing, no more calls. Even he wouldn\u2019t date someone this desperate. He was going to start looking like a stalker when what he was, was in love with her. It embarrassed even him to think like that. How could you be in love with someone you\u2019d met twice, but you knew for only twenty-four hours? It was impossible. There must be some other explanation for dreaming about her, smelling her, tasting her, hearing her voice, feeling her hair against his cheek when he was waking up in the morning. Some sort of mania or hallucination. An obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p><p>He called Paul. \u201cYeah, hi. If you\u2019re ready, I can bring down the plans for your two properties this weekend. We can go over them with the owners, walk the land, make adjustments, get moving on this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat would be great,\u201d Paul said cheerfully. \u201cWant to stay with us while you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m making some other plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about the trailer? Want to borrow it?\u201d</p><p>He laughed uncomfortably. \u201cFor sure, no. But thanks for the offer. I think I\u2019m going to stay at Jack\u2019s this trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever works. I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing you, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>Joe asked Jack if that little cabin in the woods was still available and Jack told him it was. Jack mentioned his worry about the small forest fires that seemed to be springing up all over the countryside across five states due to drought and extreme dryness. Joe was able to see firsthand what that was about when he made the drive south. He passed a couple of small pockets of fire that came dangerously close to the roads he traveled. There were not too many controlled burns out there when the weather was so dry, but he supposed some of the small plumes of smoke he saw in the distance could be fires set by Cal Fire to keep the landscape under control\u2014spacing the clumps of forest to give them an advantage in a fire, to keep it from spreading.</p><p>He was a volunteer in the Grants Pass Fire Department, but had only been called once, years ago. There was nothing quite as ominous as driving through the lush green hillsides staked with towering pines and not be able to see very far in front of you because of smoke. Or worse, driving down a road that was bordered on each side by the charred, black skeletons of once-majestic trees. When a fire had passed through, the hillsides could look like that for years and years and years.</p> <p>Joe was glad when he reached the redwoods, untouched and pristine. And then past the Virgin, wide and wild, flowing over rocks and down natural waterfalls. Another few months would bring deer hunting; deer hunters. Fishing in the Virgin would start to get real good. The boys would come down in a few months to catch the end of hunting season; Mel would throw a fit, but it wouldn\u2019t do her any good. And then she\u2019d cry if they shot any deer. The memory of it made him smile\u2014she was so sentimental, and Jack was so tender with her. But he\u2019d hunt anyway.</p><p>He walked into the bar with his plans rolled up under his arm. Preacher was waiting for him, but the bar was empty, as it often was in the middle of the afternoon. Joe got his usual bear hug from the big man. \u201cReady to be a daddy, my man?\u201d Joe asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhew, you can\u2019t know. Paige, she\u2019s big as a\u2014\u201d He stopped himself. \u201cMel says that baby\u2019s ready to walk out of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the girl,\u201d Joe said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll get her. And I\u2019ll give Brie a call\u2014they\u2019re excited to see their plans. How about Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him I\u2019d get here by early afternoon. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll show up.\u201d</p><p>When Paige came out of the back, Joe\u2019s eyes warmed over at the sight of her. She was ripe as an overdue melon. Plump and rosy and big. \u201cAw, honey,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Joe,\u201d she said, reaching for him.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and while he hugged her, the baby kicked. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you have in there? A football team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA feminine little girl,\u201d she said. \u201cDana Marie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got big feet, I guarantee it,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou want to see your new house?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>He barely had the plans laid out on a table when Brie and Mike came in. More hugs and warm greetings. \u201cAnd I understand you\u2019ve put a little rush on the building?\u201d he asked. \u201cTo make room for a newcomer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight around Christmas,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI can already see it in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you see is me getting past the first trimester. It\u2019s relief, Joe. We\u2019re not getting any younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel younger, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Mike said, and if Joe wasn\u2019t mistaken, his chest puffed a little bit.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we got your house pretty close to ready, and Paul and I will walk the property this weekend. Come over here.\u201d</p><p>Joe had Paige and Preacher seated at one table, going over plans, Mike and Brie at another, and he walked between the two with a pointer and a pencil, answering questions, penciling in adjustments.</p><p>For Preacher, he had added to the existing apartment. Downstairs the current quarters were enlarged into a great room with fireplace, no need for a kitchen but a serving area with sink, counter, dishwasher and cupboards for their own dishes and glassware that fronted a large dining room. They would use the bar\u2019s kitchen for their cooking, but should have a private place for meals. He designed a big master bedroom and enlarged the existing bath. The larger downstairs could support two more bedrooms upstairs, a Jack and Jill bath and a loft, connected to Christopher\u2019s room by a short hall. There was a wide-open staircase from the great room to the loft. It turned those little quarters into a real four-bedroom, three-bath house that could be filled with family and friends.</p><p>For Mike and Brie, twenty-five hundred square feet of living space, another five hundred attached to the house as office space for Brie with entrances from the outside and inside. Four bedrooms, a great room, a spacious kitchen, three baths including the master, and some beautiful features from vaulted ceilings, a large marble shower without doors, granite counters, stone hearths in the great room and master, slate and hardwood floors, a long, deep deck.</p><p>By the time they\u2019d gotten familiar with the designs, Paul arrived. Joe felt awkward until he saw his old friend, and then it was natural to grab him, give him a hearty greeting with slaps on the back. \u201cI\u2019ve really missed you, man,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too. Hey, I brought some drawings for you and Vanni to look at. Maybe something will work. I did it based on what you said she liked about your Grants Pass house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring them to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to impose....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? Joe\u2014we gotta get past this. Seriously. It wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was mine,\u201d he said, dropping his head briefly. \u201cWhatever, it\u2019s in the past. It\u2019s over. We should try to move on.\u201d</p><p>Paul glanced at Brie and Mike, Paige and Preacher. Seeing they were absorbed in their house plans, he quietly asked, \u201cHave you moved on, brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Joe answered with a laugh that even he knew was insincere. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to dinner,\u201d Paul said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to take the plans home first, give Vanni a chance to have a look before I get there. So she can work up her questions and complaints.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the homesite all picked out,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe can build right on the other side of the pasture, along the river.

He went out for supplies so I could stick around Paige,\u201d Preacher said, getting to his feet.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d Joe said, and all the men present went through the kitchen to help unload Jack\u2019s truck. Work done, they settled in for a beer and a little catching up. At around four, Joe shoved Paul out the door, telling him to take the plans and drawings home to Vanni and he\u2019d see him in a couple of hours.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before the dinner hour approached, which brought Mel and the little ones to the bar. Joe held the baby for a while, had a few words with Doc, said hello to Hope McCrea while she had her Jack Daniel\u2019s, passed the time with Doug and Sue Carpenter, Brenda\u2019s folks from just down the street. He checked his watch, asked for a cup of coffee from Jack and sat up at the bar.</p><p>\u201cBusiness good?\u201d Jack asked.</p> <p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Joe said. \u201cI\u2019m staying busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis stuff down here\u2014is this extra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s nice to have it. It\u2019s great that my friends want my designs. Good for my ego,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo then,\u201d Jack said, \u201cwhat\u2019s eating you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a thing, my brother.\u201d He sat up a little straighter, took in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s eating you?\u201d Jack said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing the signals, man. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>Jack lifted his coffee cup. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d</p><p>Joe knew what Jack was seeing. Joe had always been carefree. A grinning fool, a quick laugh, a lot of jokes, nothing in the world bothered him. He had a good family, good business, women when he bothered, plenty of money, lifelong friends like the boys. He knew there was a smudge on his personality, a sadness that now occupied his eyes and hadn\u2019t been there for a long time, not for a good ten years.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that, it seems like something\u2019s bothering you,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe. Not a big deal. It\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever want to talk, you know where I am.\u201d</p><p>Joe smiled. \u201cThanks, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged. \u201cMaybe she\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d Joe asked, a little stunned. He would be genuinely pissed if Paul had talked about this.</p><p>\u201cWhoever she is. Men have a lot of looks, pal. They have a look for business worries, family worries, ego worries. Combat worries\u2014I got good at spotting that one. And there\u2019s a real special look when a man wants a woman and she\u2019s out of reach.\u201d</p><p>It made Joe laugh. \u201cIs that a fact?\u201d</p><p>Jack sipped his coffee. \u201cI\u2019ve worn that look a couple of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must not have been around,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cYou might\u2019ve been. Mel made me work pretty damn hard for her. It was excruciating. Excuse me\u2014I have to load up the family. I stay late now that Paige is so close. Mel has to take the kids home, get them in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d he said.</p><p>They got Mel and the little ones settled in the truck. Jack leaned in the window to kiss her and Joe was overcome with longing. This was torture, watching his best friends, his brothers, with their women. By the end of a hunt, they were talking about getting home to their beautiful, lush, ripe women, bringing them children and love. Joe hadn\u2019t been so worried about the fact that he hadn\u2019t found this yet until recently, until he held a woman that made him feel that full, that in love, and immediately lost her.</p><p>Vanni loved her house plans. She was animated and full of life, and in that, very affectionate toward Joe. If he was reading her right, she was forgiving Joe\u2019s dalliance with her best friend. The general got into the mix, making suggestions, arguing with his daughter about what she should be doing differently. Joe was good at this sort of thing\u2014he listened while they batted around ideas and waited until the dust settled. Then he could step in with one minor adjustment and bring the whole thing together.</p><p>For Vanni and Paul, Joe designed a larger version of Paul\u2019s house, but with changes that although slight, gave it a different appearance altogether, so it didn\u2019t look like a copy and was better suited for a growing family. The features they loved were there\u2014the wide hallways, spacious rooms, high ceilings, large garage. And it had to have more bedrooms\u2014Paul was going to fill her with babies.</p><p>He spent the night in the cabin, then in the morning he drove out to Jack\u2019s property\u2014to the parcel he\u2019d given to Brie and Mike. It wasn\u2019t far from Jack\u2019s\u2014they\u2019d extended his road another quarter of a mile to their homesite. Paul had already set up shop and was hiring construction crew, quite successfully. He had the requisite trailer for his office and a Porta Potty for his crews. Now that there were plans, Paul could have the foundation poured. The septic tank would go in and the well dug. Then the plumbing and frame and wiring. \u201cThen it\u2019s game on,\u201d Joe said. \u201cLet\u2019s go walk your property at the general\u2019s,\u201d he said.</p><p>This, too, was ready to move. The first order of business was the grading of the road, which would be a three-quarter-mile stretch, but no major excavation would be required, no trees to bring down. In ball cap and jeans, Joe paced off the perimeters of the foundation and pounded in some temporary stakes with red flags on them. He took a can of spray paint and outlined the house on the ground, bringing it up close enough to the river for a nice backyard view from a deck, far enough away to avoid problems with possible flooding. \u201cI have indoor sprinklers in the design, which I recommend, but understand that in a wildfire, they aren\u2019t going to do the job. It\u2019s a precaution for a home fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cYou can pour both foundations at the same approximate time. Do Brie and Mike\u2019s first, since they have a bun in the oven, then get over here and pour yours. You can get started on the extension at the bar and as soon as Preacher\u2019s baby is a couple of weeks old, we can relocate them to the cabin. We\u2019ll tear out some walls\u2014and you should move fast on that one to keep the bar working. You can stagger your crews\u2014move the framers from the Valenzuelas\u2019 property to this property, et cetera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve built more than one house at a time.\u201d Paul smiled.</p><p>\u201cI know. Just talking,\u201d he said, smiling back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need finalized architectural drawings,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Paul said, sticking out his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll order concrete.\u201d</p><p>Joe shook it. \u201cPleasure doing business with you. I\u2019m going to head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to say goodbye to Vanni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her I said goodbye and thank-you, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, this is probably none of my business\u2014but this thing we\u2019re not talking about? It might help your case a little if you could just tell Vanni you\u2019re sorry.\u201d</p><p>Joe shook his head in a silent laugh, looking down. He put his hands in his pockets. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that, pal,\u201d he said. \u201cNot honestly.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m sorry about is how it turned out.\u201d</p><p>Paul was quiet for a long moment. Then he said, \u201cGotcha.\u201d</p><p>Vanni had nursed the baby and put him down for the night. She heard her dad walk down the hall to his room at about nine-thirty, but her husband didn\u2019t come to bed. Finally she went to the great room to see if he was hooked on something on television. She found him sitting forward in a chair, his elbows on his knees, a drink in his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He sat back and patted the chair beside him. \u201cThinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it keeping you up?\u201d she asked, sitting.</p><p>He gave her a wan smile. \u201cDo you know how great my life is? How happy I am?\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on his knee. \u201cYou\u2019ve done a real good job of making sure I do, Paul. I\u2019m just as happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to tell you something. Think back a few months. A long while back, the first night you surprised me by walking into Jack\u2019s. When all the boys got together to hunt and I had no idea you were here, in Virgin River, and you surprised me. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat very night, overcome just by seeing you, I might\u2019ve had one too many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you told me that, Paul,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI got tanked. And I made this drunken confession to Jack, about how I\u2019d seen you first but Matt got to you ahead of me. No one else heard me, thank God. But Jack knew what was going on. Later, then, after Matt was killed and the baby was born and a certain pediatrician was chasing you, Jack called me one night and told me not to be an idiot. He said if I wanted you I\u2019d better get down here and find a way to say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did? I never knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I came as fast as I could. Because if I hadn\u2019t, I was going to lose you. And I loved you. God, I loved you.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cBefore I ever held you or kissed you, I was so in love with you, sometimes it was awful. I try to imagine what it might have felt like if we\u2019d been a couple, for even one night, and you didn\u2019t want me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to ever imagine that, sweetheart,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI have what every man wants\u2014a woman he\u2019d die for. A woman who owns him, every piece of him. I really never thought I\u2019d be this lucky....\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t go crazy on me.\u201d She put her hand along his cheek. \u201cJust pick up your dirty underwear like a good boy and I\u2019ll reward you in many remarkable ways.\u201d</p><p>But Paul wasn\u2019t laughing. \u201cDid you see my friend Joe? The guy is in pain. He\u2019s dying. He had one night with a woman who obviously fulfilled every wish buried in his subconscious. She put a hex on him, then rejected him. Did you see him?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cPaul, his timing was bad. We can\u2019t help that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was hers. I\u2019ve known the man for fifteen years. He might be smooth, but he\u2019s not disreputable. He wouldn\u2019t take a woman to bed if she didn\u2019t want to go. If Nikki had expressed the least hesitation, he wouldn\u2019t have touched her. I know him. I know him as well as I knew Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? She made a mistake. What are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t make a bigger one,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t come any better than Joe. There must have been some reason she said yes that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent the little notes from him. She hasn\u2019t changed her mind. You want me to talk to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, honey. I\u2019m going to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you should do that,\u201d she said nervously.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m going to. I\u2019ve been thinking about it all day and I\u2019m calling her. Right now. You want to listen in or go put your head under the pillow?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath. \u201cI\u2019ll listen,\u201d she said. \u201cBut please, don\u2019t let on I\u2019m here. I feel really strange about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to trust me,\u201d he said, picking up the phone. He dialed the number. \u201cI have to do this.\u201d</p><p>Nikki could no doubt see the number on the caller ID because she picked up. She answered, \u201cHi, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not sweetie,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Hi.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have to talk to you. About Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we settled that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess it\u2019s pretty much settled for you,\u201d Paul said. \u201cNot quite settled for me. Just for my peace of mind, Nikki, I have to ask you something. See, I\u2019ve known Joe a long time now and I\u2019ve trusted him with my life. Literally. I went to war with the guy. I\u2019ve seen him with women, and this guy\u2014he\u2019s always been a classy guy. I\u2019ve never known him to treat a woman badly....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t treat me badly, Paul,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Paul let out a breath. \u201cWell, thank God. That\u2019s a relief. I was afraid, I don\u2019t know...Afraid I didn\u2019t know him as well as I thought I did. I mean, you were really upset\u2014and then I found Joe to be just as upset to hear you left here in tears. He wouldn\u2019t tell me what went on between you two, but he insisted he hadn\u2019t done anything to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Paul. You can let this go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I just couldn\u2019t stand to think he\u2019d treat a woman wrong. He\u2019s not that kind of guy. You\u2019ll be glad to know, finally he seems to be putting this whole thing behind him. It was killing him for a while there, but I think he\u2019s getting better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, a little bit. Trying to get over it. Over you. He was up here this weekend. There were architectural plans he had to bring me\u2014I\u2019m going to build three of his houses. Vanni told me he was writing notes, leaving messages. I guess he had it pretty bad, but it\u2019s not like Joe to bother a woman who doesn\u2019t want to be bothered. You\u2019ll probably be shed of him pretty soon. Maybe you already are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cGood. Then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t exactly know what has him so jammed up. I\u2019m sure he gets the message by now. That you don\u2019t want anything to do with him. Ever. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he wanted to apologize. It\u2019s not necessary,\u201d she said.</p><p>Paul hmmed. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I suggested he might get some points with Vanni if he said he was sorry. He said he couldn\u2019t do that\u2014he wasn\u2019t sorry. Just disappointed by how it turned out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was best,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter all, it was brief...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. God forbid something like that should ever happen again...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul, I gave a man five years and he was lying to me the whole time. He kept saying he needed more time before making a commitment and then finally admitted he\u2019d never get married, never have a family. It was like I didn\u2019t know him at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Nikki. That was bad, I\u2019m sorry. My friend Joe? He\u2019s not that kind of guy. A lie would turn into acid in his mouth. If he wasn\u2019t going the distance, he\u2019d say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better this way. Better to let it go now, before...I wouldn\u2019t want to go through something like that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you know what you\u2019re doing. Joe, he\u2019s still a little roughed up, but he\u2019ll get over it. You probably know better than anyone how that feels, right? Trying to get over someone?\u201d He lifted his eyebrows toward his wife.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>\u201cThere you go. He said we all have to move past it, get it behind us. That\u2019s what you want, right? For him to forget about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, her voice weak and quivering a little.</p> <p>\u201cGod, I hope you\u2019re right about this, Nikki,\u201d he said. \u201cThat this is a man to put behind you. I did that once, you know. Different circumstances\u2014I was up against Matt. But I fell in love with Vanni so fast it was ridiculous. No one would believe it\u2014that I took one look at her and man, it just hit me. When Matt made his move, I backed right off. I let her go, I wasn\u2019t going to compete with my best friend for a woman. I have to tell you\u2014I started to regret that ten minutes later. For years all I could think was why the hell didn\u2019t I walk right up to them and say, \u2018Out of my way, buddy\u2014I saw her first!\u2019\u201d</p><p>Silence answered him.</p><p>\u201cBut I guess we don\u2019t have much in common there, huh? There was no competition, except maybe Joe was competing with a rotten memory. If there was anything about him you thought was worth a damn, you never would have let him get away. So. I just hope you\u2019re right....\u201d</p><p>She whimpered a little bit. \u201cIt was one night....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think maybe the crazy fool loves you,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d she said, but there were tears in her voice.</p><p>\u201cNikki,\u201d Paul said softly. \u201cYou said yes, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I said yes,\u201d she sniffed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t force me. He didn\u2019t even insist. He\u2019s not that kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. You know, it\u2019s probably none of my business, but it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me\u2014two people trying to get over each other because something good happened, something both of you wanted to happen. But I guess you know what you want. And don\u2019t want. Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get hurt again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear ya, Nikki. I understand, I do. You\u2019ll be strong enough to take a chance again someday. When you are, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll stumble on a good man. There are probably a million of \u2019em out there. Just wanted to be sure nothing bad happened.\u201d</p><p>It took her a minute to respond. \u201cNothing bad happened.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me. You take care, Nikki.\u201d He hung up the phone and looked at his wife. He smiled. \u201cThat was very sneaky,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>T he dry heat of July brought passionately anticipated action to the Middleton family\u2014labor pains. Preacher was back and forth from the kitchen to his quarters no less than every ten minutes. \u201cHow is it now?\u201d he asked Paige.</p><p>Paige was reading to Christopher. \u201cJohn, it\u2019s going to be a very long day for you if you can\u2019t relax a little. I\u2019m still having contractions ten minutes apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s going to be today, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis could go on for twenty-four hours,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not real hard.\u201d Then she turned to Chris. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you read this page, honey. You can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay,\u201d he said, and proceeded to read, but whether from identifying the words or from memory, it was hard to tell.</p><p>Preacher went back to the kitchen, his head hanging. \u201cStill ten minutes,\u201d he told Jack.</p><p>\u201cI have an idea, buddy. Let\u2019s get some food ready for dinner tonight and tomorrow night, just in case you don\u2019t feel like cooking. I\u2019ll hold down the fort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we call Mel again?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe should let her catch a nap, in case she has to be up all night with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jack chuckled under his breath. His own experience with his firstborn had definitely lacked this edge of anticipation, it having come upon him so fast. Maybe the nice slow buildup wasn\u2019t so great after all. Preacher was going to be a wreck by the time this baby finally made an appearance.</p><p>As the afternoon dragged out, and the contractions not any closer together, Jack gave Brie a heads-up when he saw her. \u201cI have a feeling I might need some child-care assistance at the house,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Paige needs Mel during the night, can you and Mike come out to my place, stay with the kids, so I can stay here with Christopher? When Mel\u2019s working at Doc\u2019s, I like to be close by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. How\u2019s Paige doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly labor. She\u2019s been trying to rest to save her strength, but I think Preacher\u2019s driving her crazy,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cAw, he\u2019s excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcited doesn\u2019t touch it.\u201d</p><p>Jack was jotting all this down in a letter for Rick, between serving drinks and meals to his customers. He thought he was turning out a very humorous running commentary on Preacher\u2019s nerves, Paige\u2019s slow progress and growing annoyance with her husband. The dinner hour came and Preacher, who had never held frequent or long conversations with patrons, told everyone who came in that her pains were down to eight minutes apart.</p><p>Mel arrived, carrying Emma and holding David\u2019s pudgy little hand as he toddled in the door. He spied Jack and said, \u201cDa!\u201d</p><p>When Jack saw her, his eyes grew warm. It hadn\u2019t changed for him since the first day she\u2019d walked into his bar. She was so damn beautiful, so sexy, even with a baby on her shoulder and a toddler in hand. And though she was still complaining about her figure since Emma was born, the jeans she was wearing sure didn\u2019t look any larger to him\u2014those jeans just set him on fire. He was pretty sure that when she was old and gray, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to keep his hands off her.</p><p>He walked around the bar and crouched for David. He put out his hands. \u201cCome on, cowboy. Come to Dad.\u201d</p><p>Mel let go of the hand and watched as Davie literally flew into his father\u2019s arms. She laughed at his eagerness, his clumsiness, and her eyes glowed as he fell into his father\u2019s arms. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, \u201cI heard someone\u2019s trying to have a baby around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you were able to get a little nap,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI slept for a couple of hours. It was nice. Can you hang on to him so I can just look in on Paige?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Take your time.\u201d</p><p>When Mel got to their quarters, she found Paige pacing back and forth. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to walk them down to five minutes,\u201d she reported. \u201cBut I\u2019m not moving very fast. It was like this with Christopher. A long early labor, all in my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way some women like to do it,\u201d Mel said. \u201cAre you uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, not really. I can walk and talk through them. If they\u2019re no different after dinner, I\u2019m going to bed early and see if I can get a little sleep, but with John asking me every five minutes how I\u2019m doing, that could be hard.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cPlease, clear soup for dinner. Nothing heavy. Just on the off chance you get sick during delivery. That happens to some women during transition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had John make up some broth and Jell-O.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. May the Force be with you.\u201d Mel laughed.</p><p>Sensing it could be a middle-of-the-night event, Mel got her children and herself settled early. At about ten o\u2019clock she roused briefly as she felt her husband slip in beside her. She instinctively turned into his waiting arms, cuddling up against him. He slipped his big hand under the T-shirt she wore and she said, \u201cYou have to let me sleep. You know Preacher is going to get me up soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you sleep,\u201d he said, kissing her brow, pulling her close.</p><p>\u201cDid you happen to get an update as you were closing the bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still at eight minutes. And Preacher is growing weak from the strain.\u201d</p><p>She laughed in spite of herself. \u201cGod, this is going to be a fun one,\u201d she said. \u201cNow snuggle me close and put me to sleep.\u201d</p><p>The call came at midnight. When she heard the phone ring, she rolled over and moaned. \u201cI knew she was going to do this. Some women just aren\u2019t happy unless they labor all night.\u201d Jack lifted the phone and passed it to her. \u201cEvening, Paige.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mel,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m at five to seven minutes now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty good, but they\u2019re getting nice and strong, lasting a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. It sounds like I might have time to nurse Emma while I wait for Mike and Brie to come.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d Paige said. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you across the street in a half hour. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a date. If anything changes, call me. I can always rush and get there in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>They were in motion, the midwife and her partner. While she headed for the nursery, Jack called his sister and put fresh linens on the bed so the babysitters could crawl in and sleep. No reason for them to sit up all night. And while no one expected Jack to be up all night, it was his routine to be awake and available when Mel was delivering at Doc\u2019s house. About thirty minutes later, they pulled up to the bar. They kissed goodbye and Mel went to Doc\u2019s while Jack went into the bar, which was lit up like a church.</p> <p>Preacher was pacing. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jack looked at his watch. \u201cWe\u2019re right on time, Preach.\u201d</p><p>Paige stood up from the table. \u201cJack, I\u2019d like you to pour John a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. I want to be alert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, you\u2019re way beyond alert. And I don\u2019t think I can take another minute. Do as I say!\u201d</p> <p>Jack went behind the bar. \u201cMy man, when a woman is having a baby, you do everything she says, and you do it fast.\u201d He brought down a bottle. \u201cJust a little something to take the edge off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cPreach, you\u2019re six-four and weigh at least two-fifty. A shot isn\u2019t going to do nearly enough good. Mel should probably have you on Xanax.\u201d He tipped the bottle of Preacher\u2019s preferred whiskey over a glass. Reluctantly, Preacher picked up the drink and threw it back.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristopher all tucked in and asleep?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cHe is. He\u2019ll be fine till about seven.\u201d</p> <p>Jack walked around the bar. He leaned down and kissed Paige on the head. \u201cHave a good delivery, honey,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled up at him. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d Then she dropped back into the chair, holding her tummy as a contraction got her. She started out breathing slowly, then as the pain threshold heightened, she began to pant and her face took on that look. She was starting to struggle. Jack smiled, watching. As the contraction eased, her features relaxed and finally, taking a deep breath, she smiled up at him. \u201cThey\u2019re getting pretty good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing great,\u201d Jack said, putting out a hand to bring her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cAw, man,\u201d Preacher groaned. He walked over to Paige and swept her up in his arms to carry her to Doc\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAh, Preach, don\u2019t do that,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThe minute she gets to Doc\u2019s, I bet Mel is going to have her walking. It helps speed up the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cMel will do what Mel will do, I will do what I will do.\u201d And out the door he went, carrying his wife to have their baby.</p><p>Jack\u2019s shoulders shook with laughter. He hoped Mel didn\u2019t knock Preacher over the head with a big club before morning.</p><p>Paige\u2019s labor was not fast, but it was efficient and perfect in many ways. It took until three in the morning to get to six centimeters, but then the action picked up. Mel broke her water and by 5:00 a.m., she was almost fully dilated. She managed the discomfort very well.</p> <p>Preacher, however, grew paler and weaker with every contraction. Before letting Paige begin to push, Mel brought a chair into the room. \u201cJohn,\u201d she said, \u201cI want you to sit, and if you start to feel the least bit light-headed, put your head between your knees. If you faint, there\u2019s nothing I can do for you\u2014I\u2019m busy with Paige.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to faint,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting forever for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, you don\u2019t have to stay,\u201d Paige told him. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>For a man like Preacher to see his little wife struggle and have pain was obviously torture. He was much more comfortable in the role of protector. Mel knew immediately that he wasn\u2019t going to be much help.</p><p>When Paige finally delivered the baby\u2019s head at 6:00 a.m., Preacher leaned over his wife, took a look and collapsed into the chair with a groan. He put his head between his knees.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Paige, pant. Give me just a second, we have a little cord issue. I\u2019m going to be able to handle it fine. There we go\u2014just pant for me, honey.\u201d Mel slipped the cord over the baby\u2019s head easily. \u201cOkay, small push now. We\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Paige asked.</p><p>The baby, not out yet, began to cry. \u201cHear that? I\u2019m sure. Bring her out, Paige, easy does it.\u201d The baby slid neatly into Mel\u2019s hands and screamed bloody murder. \u201cOh boy, she\u2019s strong! Listen to those lungs! And big!\u201d She put the baby in her newborn towel, placed her on Paige\u2019s belly to dry her off. That done, she clamped and cut the cord. Preacher stood on shaky legs, watched the cutting of the cord and slid weakly into the chair again, groaning. Mel tried not to laugh.</p><p>She rewrapped the baby and passed her to Paige. After a little snuggling, she helped Paige settle her baby to the breast, since Preacher wasn\u2019t going to be able to do it. \u201cJohn, I want you to keep your eyes up here, on your wife and baby. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I still have delivery work to do, there will be blood, and I don\u2019t want you to faint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t faint,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou do as I say,\u201d Mel told him.</p><p>\u201cHere, John,\u201d Paige said softly. \u201cLook at your girl. Isn\u2019t she beautiful?\u201d</p><p>Mel was massaging the uterus when she heard a sound. She looked up over Paige\u2019s raised knees and saw a most stunning sight. Big old Preacher was resting his lips against the baby\u2019s head and crying his eyes out. Huge tears ran down his cheeks and dropped onto the newborn\u2019s head. He slipped a meaty arm under his wife\u2019s shoulders, holding her and the baby as one, and sobbed.</p><p>Remarkable. Paige just smiled and touched her husband\u2019s face with gentle, loving fingers. Mel was moved almost to tears herself by the big man\u2019s emotion. He worshipped his wife, his little family, and he was so grateful, he was overwhelmed. It was so gratifying to help bring a child into a union of such devotion. It was what she lived for.</p><p>Her work was not done; the placenta had not delivered. A midwife friend who was older than Mel by twenty years had given her a tip years ago that seemed like sheer magic, yet worked. Mel looked at Paige and said, \u201cPaige, time to let go of the placenta, please.\u201d Then she got back in her position, massaged a little more and, remarkably, the job was done. She shook her head and chuckled to herself. People who didn\u2019t do this all the time would simply never believe it.</p><p>Mel finished her work, let the baby suckle awhile to get the uterus contracting and stanch the bleeding. She examined her patient\u2014no stitches necessary\u2014then covered her and took the baby. \u201cLet\u2019s clean her up,\u201d she said softly. \u201cPeople will want to see her soon.\u201d</p><p>Preacher sniffed back his tears, wiped at his face. But when he spoke, his voice was still weak with emotion. \u201cGod, Mel\u2014thank you. Thank you so much. You took such good care of her. Of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did most of the work. Help me, Preach. Help me wash the baby.\u201d</p><p>She unwrapped the newborn and placed her in Preacher\u2019s palms; his large, soft, gentle palms. Mel coaxed him to lower her into the bath and carefully ran a warm cloth over the little body, cleaning her off.</p><p>\u201cLook at those big feet,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cLook at that tiny little head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d Mel held the towel. \u201cRight here, Preach,\u201d she said.</p><p>Preacher laid the baby in the clean towel and Mel wrapped her. \u201cTake her out in the hall to show Doc. But please, stay upstairs for now. I\u2019m going to do a little cleanup and you can bring her right back in.\u201d</p><p>Mel didn\u2019t want Preacher in the room when she handled the cleanup of his wife, the changing of bloody sheets. And she didn\u2019t want him carrying the baby down the stairs in case he got light-headed again. She worked faster than usual. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d she whispered to Paige.</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019ve been up all night.\u201d</p><p>Mel palpated her uterus. \u201cYou\u2019re already contracting like mad. That uterus is getting nice and firm.\u201d She smiled at her patient. \u201cHe\u2019ll be okay now, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor John. That was harder on him than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bigger they are...\u201d Mel laughed.</p><p>Her work was done by 7:00 a.m. Preacher was seated at Paige\u2019s side, holding his baby daughter. Mel went downstairs and stepped out into the fresh, bright morning. She stood on Doc\u2019s porch and heard the sound she loved. Thwack, thwack, thwack. Jack was splitting logs behind the bar. She walked across the street.</p><p>She leaned on the corner of the building, watching him. Her mind wandered back in time to her first delivery in this town\u2014a one-hundred-percent-successful delivery much like the one she had just assisted. Then, as now, she had crossed the street and watched Jack as he hefted an ax over his head and brought it down. Watched the muscles in his arms and shoulders at work and admired his hard good looks.</p><p>When he saw her, he leaned the ax up against the stump and went to her. She smiled and walked into his arms. He crossed those arms under her bottom and brought her up to his face. \u201cIt was perfect,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI love the way those babies light you up.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him deeply and his arms tightened under her.</p><p>\u201cHow are they doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreacher\u2019s a little wobbly, but Paige and the baby are great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been looking forward to it for so long,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cHe might\u2019ve gotten himself a little too worked up. Maybe he peaked too soon,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you sleep?\u201d she asked, touching his hair.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t sleep when you work,\u201d he said, touching her lips again. \u201cCan I get you anything? Breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice. My children will be awake by the time I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it hard, baby?\u201d he asked. \u201cAfter the hysterectomy?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and smiled. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the hard part. There is nothing sad about bringing a new life to a couple as in love as they are.\u201d She kissed him again. \u201cI admit, I was thinking of one more, down the road a bit. I tend to think like that after ours are settled in bed and quiet....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot more than either of us thought we\u2019d get,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dealing with it pretty well. I\u2019m telling myself not to be greedy. As long as I have you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed, a rich, deep rumbling sound. \u201cAs if you could get rid of me now.\u201d</p><p>Joe used to look forward to trips to Virgin River\u2014it was such a welcome respite from his demanding work. Usually he was going with a purpose that included his friends\u2014either a gathering of the boys for sport or someone in need of help. In fact, if it hadn\u2019t been for certain memories that were hard to shake, this trip would be a celebration. Preacher\u2019s baby had arrived, and Joe liked babies\u2014he\u2019d been an uncle five times. He\u2019d always thought that by now he\u2019d have a couple of his own.</p><p>The drive seemed longer than usual, but he made it before Saturday noon. He went straight to Jack\u2019s bar and once there, his first order of business was to deliver a large bouquet of flowers to Paige. There was no one in the bar and he didn\u2019t even glance into the kitchen, but went straight to the apartment. The door was standing open, so he tapped lightly and went in. He found Paige sitting on the couch with the cradle nearby, folding clothes into neat little piles. \u201cJoe!\u201d she said, her face brightening when she saw him. \u201cOh my, are these for me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course they\u2019re for you, sweetheart. Aren\u2019t you the new mom?\u201d She opened her arms to him and he held her a long moment. \u201cYou sure look wonderful for someone who just had a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been very spoiled this week. Lots of help. When you need something, anything, this is the place to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feeling good?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFantastic. And she\u2019s a good little girl.\u201d</p><p>He peered into the cradle. \u201cAh, then where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you three guesses. I can\u2019t get John to put her down.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cIs he holding her while he\u2019s stirring a pot?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cLord, I hope not. He said he was going to see if Christopher would lie down for a little nap and took Dana upstairs with him. The one who could use a nap is John. He must surely be exhausted.\u201d</p> <p>Joe laughed. \u201cHere, honey\u2014sit down. Tell me about it. Did you have an easy time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a very long time. It wasn\u2019t so much hard as it took forever. I was starting to think she\u2019d never come. And John almost drove me out of my mind. After about twenty hours of labor, I was afraid he was going to go in after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have been pretty wound up,\u201d Joe said. \u201cIs he pestering you for another one yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, I think he\u2019s going to lighten up on all those children he thought he had to have. The birth was kind of hard on John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Joe said, surprised.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he doesn\u2019t like to see me uncomfortable. And it turns out that this big man who can shoot and dress animals or carry wounded soldiers off the battlefield doesn\u2019t do too well if there\u2019s a drop of blood within ten feet of his wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a little on the protective side,\u201d Joe confirmed. \u201cThink you\u2019re going to be able to move out to the cabin soon? As soon as you do\u2014we pour the extended-foundation slab and start tearing out walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014I\u2019m ready,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get going on this building. We\u2019re just going to move clothes and toys and the computer. Paul will cover everything, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will all be protected\u2014either in storage or pushed up against a safe wall and secured, but you\u2019ll be able to get to it.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, Preacher wandered in. He was holding the baby in the crook of his arm and she looked small enough to fit in the palm of his hand. Her little pink blanket was wrapped neatly around her, her bald head sticking out of the top, and he handled her as if she were attached to the inside of his forearm. \u201cJoe!\u201d he said, but he said it with quiet enthusiasm. \u201cGreat to see you, man.\u201d</p><p>Joe stood and reached for the baby. \u201cMy turn, buddy. Let\u2019s see what you made here.\u201d</p><p>Preacher handed over the baby and Joe brought her into his arms. \u201cGod, she\u2019s beautiful. I think you lucked out, Paige. I think she\u2019s going to look like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn\u2019s been worried that she\u2019ll be six-four and three hundred pounds. I tried to explain that would take a lot more testosterone than she\u2019ll have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her to be sweet and beautiful like her mom,\u201d Preacher said.</p> <p>\u201cHow much did she weigh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight-ten. Nice and big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks like a five-pounder in your husband\u2019s arms,\u201d Joe said. \u201cYou two do good work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy man, it was the hardest work I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cUm, John,\u201d Paige said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t work hard, baby, you know that. But I damn near worried myself into the ground. Mel almost had to give me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it everything you thought it would be?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was way more than I thought it would be. I cried like a baby.\u201d</p><p>These two, Joe thought. He wondered if they had any idea how cute they were. \u201cWe have to call Paul, tell him I\u2019m here. And Brie and Mike. I think we have the plans final and I\u2019d like to get out to the properties today so I can leave early tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to take off so soon?\u201d Paige asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have had the plans delivered, but I didn\u2019t want to miss a chance to see the baby. And if Paul\u2019s building schedule goes as planned, you\u2019ll be in your new apartment in no time at all. You shouldn\u2019t have to spend even six months in Jack\u2019s cabin, which puts you back home before Christmas. Plus, if Preach can cook during the day in spite of the noise, the crews should be able to leave the property by dinnertime. I don\u2019t think the bar will have to be closed much at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d Paige said.</p><p>Phone calls were made and everyone convened in the bar to look at house plans. When everyone seemed in agreement about their plans, Joe and Paul went out to the general\u2019s house so that Vanessa could comb over her plans, which took a couple of hours.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s walk your property first,\u201d Joe said to Paul. \u201cThen you\u2019re good to go. We\u2019ll get the Valenzuelas on the way back to town. You have concrete ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing this week. Will you come back for dinner?\u201d he asked Joe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a rain check,\u201d Joe said. \u201cI want to visit with Jack and Mel a little bit tonight, so I\u2019ll take dinner at the bar. Then I\u2019m on the road early tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, I was hoping to get a little more time with you,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cNext time, okay? It\u2019s a quick trip for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe,\u201d she said, laying a hand on his arm. \u201cI can\u2019t help but feel we\u2019ve had a big misunderstanding. And it\u2019s affected our friendship. Five minutes before Paul asked me to marry him, he told me I have the worst goddamn temper...and that I\u2019m really hard to shut up. I think I might\u2019ve overreacted.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled in spite of himself. \u201cThe misunderstanding must have been between the woman and I.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI still can\u2019t figure out what went wrong. Our friendship is okay, Vanni. Be patient with me. This will pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so, Joe. I\u2019m sorry you were hurt. I\u2019m sorry I jumped to conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, laughing it off. \u201cWhat could you do? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to help you out with the details. Whatever she says is her business, but I\u2019ve already said more than I like. I don\u2019t want to betray her privacy.\u201d</p><p>By five, Joe had left the drawings in Paul\u2019s very capable hands and was headed back to Jack\u2019s, where he found Mel and the kids waiting for him. Before long everyone but Vanni and Paul had gathered. There was a humorous debrief on Paige\u2019s delivery that had them all laughing while they enjoyed Preacher\u2019s broiled trout with rice.</p><p>Not long after Mel and the kids left, a group of Hot Shots, USDA federal firefighters, came in\u2014a hand crew of about ten of the usual eighteen\u2014getting everyone\u2019s attention. Most of the firefighters used locally were inmates, felons, but since these guys were not, Jack and Preacher pushed tables together and set them up with beer as well as dinner in exchange for news. There had been a fire back in the Trinity Alps and these boys had been working it for two days. It looked to be contained and they were released to go home and wouldn\u2019t be recalled. They were starved for decent food and a cold beer.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I wasn\u2019t even aware of it,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI can see for miles from my front yard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinds have been from the southwest, it\u2019s up the mountain and we\u2019ve had it curtailed to a slow, dense burn for twenty-four hours. I think we\u2019ve got it now. We can\u2019t be recalled for at least twenty-four hours, so we\u2019re probably done with that fire. We\u2019ll be headed to the Mogollon Rim in Arizona, if it\u2019s still hot in two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly was this last one?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly about twenty-five miles back there. Just over the mountain.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-five miles was uncomfortably close; Jack and Preacher had a lot of questions for them about the winds, the weather forecasts, any controlled burns in the area. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any controlled burns near the redwoods right now,\u201d one of them said.</p><p>Jack set them up one more time, given they were on the way home and wouldn\u2019t be going back into the forest. Of course he wouldn\u2019t take a dime from them. \u201cYou keep our towns safe\u2014you eat and drink on the house anytime you\u2019ve been working a fire. It\u2019s the least we can do. As long as you have a designated driver...\u201d</p><p>They all laughed, a couple of them slapping one comrade on the back. \u201cWe always try to keep at least one Mormon on the crew\u2014the designated good influence.\u201d</p><p>As the hour grew later, Jack kept the bar open a little while longer so the firefighters could unwind. Joe sat up at the bar facing Jack. \u201cYou can pour me one good-night pop, then I\u2019m getting out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you\u2019re okay at that cabin?\u201d Jack asked, pouring him a shot. \u201cThere\u2019s room at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack\u2014it\u2019s terrific. I\u2019ll have the sheets washed and back on the bed in the morning before I leave. Then we\u2019ll get Preacher\u2019s family in there and start tearing up his apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not necessary to do laundry. There are a lot of women around town who like a little housekeeping work....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ll handle it. I appreciate the hospitality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that other matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman. The one who has you all fucked up.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo change,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still fucked up. But I\u2019ll get over it. I have experience getting over women. I had a wife I loved once\u2014she ripped me up good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Joe. There\u2019s practically no one I\u2019d rather see happy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, that\u2019s one of the problems with this place,\u201d Joe said. \u201cYou guys. When you opened this bar, there were five of us at loose ends, and not looking to settle down. The only ones settled with women were Zeke, Corny, Phillips and Stephens. The rest of us were getting well into our thirties, pretty damn happy to be single. Plenty of women out there to keep us busy for a little while. Then you guys\u2014Jesus. You not only hooked up, you found these incredible...\u201d</p><p>Jack poured himself a shot to join his friend in commiseration. \u201cWe got lucky,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt goes way past luck,\u201d Joe said. \u201cSome god was smiling on you.\u201d He looked into his glass. \u201cI\u2019m just an idiot. I had my arms around this woman for one long, incredible night and I thought\u2014this is what I\u2019ve been waiting for my whole life. And she slipped away from me that fast,\u201d he said, snapping his fingers. \u201cI woke up alone.\u201d He lifted his drink to his lips.</p><p>Chairs scraped back as the Hot Shots got up to leave. They all hollered their thanks, a couple of them coming forward to shake Jack\u2019s hand, then filed out the door.</p><p>Alone in the bar, Preacher in the back with his family, Jack said, \u201cHow about going after her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried. She\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned on the bar. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, man. I thought that was going to happen to me with Mel. From the second she hit town, she said she was leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you know? Or think you knew? With Mel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d he said, and laughed. \u201cIt was real slow. Took me five or ten minutes. It was the jeans. Have you ever noticed how my wife looks in a pair of jeans? Maybe you shouldn\u2019t answer that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me it was a pink dress...\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhoa, damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t give me alcohol,\u201d he said. \u201cMakes me talk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNikki,\u201d he said, and it wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cYeah, buddy. I saw her. And I think I saw you see her.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI feel your pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni was furious with me. Paul was sympathetic but pissed. Well,\u201d he amended, \u201cthey\u2019re getting over that now. But the girl won\u2019t talk to me. Won\u2019t return calls. I can\u2019t figure out what I did. I was as good to her as I knew how to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew, that bites,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBut, buddy, that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t someone out there, just waiting for you to find her. I was forty, man. I thought I was way past having this life. Mel\u2014she makes me feel like a teenager.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, maybe it\u2019ll happen. But not while I\u2019m like this. I\u2019m stung. I have to get over this before I can dip into the market again. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang in there, pal. It\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. He threw back the rest of his shot and stood. \u201cYou should get home to the family. I\u2019m going to borrow your porch for a cigar, since you have the sand can out there, then to the cabin to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll lock you out and take off from the back. There\u2019s coffee in the fridge, but that\u2019s it. Want a beer or bottle to take to the cabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m good and tired,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m planning to get out of here early.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou bet. And, brother? Don\u2019t lick this wound too long, huh?\u201d</p><p>He shook Jack\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Joe stepped out onto Jack\u2019s porch and looked up at the sky. He heard the door lock behind him; the Open sign clicked off. The stars were fewer, dimmer, and he hoped it wasn\u2019t smoke in the sky. He pulled out his cigar from his shirt pocket, clipped the end and struck a match on his shoe. It flared.</p><p>And illuminated her.</p><p>She was wearing tight jeans and high-heeled sandals, a little blue knit shirt, a gold necklace. She leaned against the porch post in the corner, legs crossed, arms crossed, that shiny black hair resting on her shoulders. He took a step toward her, bewildered, and the match burned down to singe his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d he said, shaking it out. He put his boot over it, crushing it for sure. Then he lit another match and took another step toward her.</p> <p>There wasn\u2019t much light besides the match, but he could clearly see the tracks of tears down her cheeks, her large dark eyes shining in the glow of the match. He shook it out. He put the cigar back in his pocket. \u201cThis is about where we started,\u201d he said, not getting too close.</p><p>\u201cI know. Do you hate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said, but he kept a safe distance.</p><p>\u201cI was embarrassed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmbarrassed?\u201d he repeated. \u201cScared?\u201d</p><p>She gave a deep sigh. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine what you thought of me. I jumped into bed with you so fast...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have asked me. I jumped into bed with you pretty fast, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen can get away with that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cMy punishment was pretty brutal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI guess it was. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cScared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Joe...I was so damn scared. I thought about morning coming and you giving me a whack on the butt and saying, \u2018Thanks, baby.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say or do to make you think it could be like that?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you, Joe. It was me. I guess I just wasn\u2019t ready to move on yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid panic come with the morning?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It was a nice night. A night like I\u2019d like to have again, and I thought about what it would feel like to look forward to it and be\u2014\u201d She lifted her chin and sniffed. \u201cNot in the cards.\u201d</p><p>He laughed without humor. \u201cSo you ended it to keep me from ending it? Jesus, Nikki, all I wanted to do was make you feel like you were headed for something good. What the hell happened between us to make you think that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just my past,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cYou were wonderful to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so\u2014you never want to hear from me again?\u201d he asked, totally stumped. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to even see if there was something more there? Scared of that, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid to go any further. We don\u2019t even know each other! I want something permanent, I want a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you listening? I don\u2019t have any idea if that\u2019s going to happen with us, you and me\u2014we\u2019re too new. But wasn\u2019t I clear? I\u2019m not avoiding that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, I think I might be clueless when it comes to love. Afraid I wouldn\u2019t know real love if it bit me in the ass.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled in spite of himself. \u201cBeen there,\u201d he said. \u201cPretty recently, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was probably mistaken. At the time it seemed to me you were showing me something good. Sincere. Loving. But it could have just been...You know. Sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo complaints about the sex, then,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt was so much more than that. For me, it was so much more than that.\u201d</p><p>It was a huge relief to hear her say that, he actually let out a slow breath. He reached out a hand and wiped a tear from her cheek. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think it could\u2019ve been more than that for me, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you came back here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Paul called me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul?\u201d he asked, astonished.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I think I\u2019ve been played.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called to tell me not to worry about you\u2014that although you admitted you had it real bad for me, you were working at getting over me and I\u2019d probably be free of you in no time. He said you wouldn\u2019t bother a woman who didn\u2019t want to be bothered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did that? Why\u2019d he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make me think about what I might be giving up, maybe.\u201d She wiped the other cheek. \u201cSo. You\u2019re over me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still working on it.\u201d He looked down for a second, thinking. \u201cWhat did you come back for?\u201d he asked her. \u201cTo clear the air? Get it over with? More sex? After which you\u2019ll take off before I\u2019m awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Vanni called me. She told me she\u2019d been thinking about things, and decided I must be out of my mind. She told me a lot of the same things you\u2019d already told me\u2014about coming together to help your friends, about being there for Paul while he buried Matt. She knew that if she ever needed your help for any reason, you\u2019d be there for her. And I thought, what the hell\u2019s the matter with me? I\u2019ve always wanted to be with someone who thinks like that, acts like that.\u201d She looked up at him with those wide, damp eyes. \u201cShe told me you\u2019d be here\u2014bringing Paul the plans. Should I have stayed away? Would that have been for the best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Nikki,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to kid you\u2014the way you ran out on me...That was awful. Then I wrote you that it broke me apart and you still wouldn\u2019t respond. What am I going to think, huh? You\u2019re not the only one who doesn\u2019t feel like getting hurt again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know it by the way I acted with you, but I\u2019m inexperienced. I\u2019ve never done that before. It turns out I\u2019m lousy at one-night stands. All paranoid and spooked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Me, too,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought of it as a one-night stand. Not even that one night. I was destroyed to find you gone. More destroyed to hear it made you cry. I couldn\u2019t believe anything happened to make you cry. I\u2019m still having trouble with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, here\u2019s what happened to me. He said he loved me. We lived together for years. I kept saying to him, I need a commitment, I want a family. And he kept saying, I might need a little more time on that. And then he finally told me\u2014he had a vasectomy behind my back a couple of years ago because he was afraid I\u2019d get ahead of him, stop taking my pills and sneak a baby out of him. That\u2019s when I knew\u2014there was no love, no trust. He was a liar and he was just using me. It was a horrible thing to face up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Joe breathed, almost speechless.</p><p>\u201cI thought he loved me and was trying to come to terms with the whole forever thing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019d been through a rocky divorce about ten years back. It made sense to me that he\u2019d be nervous. I didn\u2019t know he was lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki, I\u2019m sorry. That was bad, what he did. He should\u2019ve been honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And then there was you. In five minutes I knew you were more honest and straightforward than he was, but I doubted the signals. I wanted to fall for you\u2014but I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><p>He reached a hand toward her shining black hair. So soft. \u201cBy morning, there wasn\u2019t an inch of me you didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a big mole on your butt,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should probably get that looked at. And a scar on your shoulder. And I think you had your appendix out.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. So, she had been paying attention. He wasn\u2019t the only one, then. \u201cI was twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here,\u201d she said, reaching out to his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI got shot in Fallujah. Mike Valenzuela kept us all alive till Jack could get us out of there. Six of us were bleeding all over the place, there were snipers everywhere, but we got out. Paul gave up a spleen. It was ugly. It ended the Marines for me\u2014I\u2019m out of the reserves now. Paul too.\u201d He smiled. \u201cSee? You know things about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Joe leaned toward her and kissed the path of a tear on her right cheek. He threaded a hand around the back of her neck and kissed her temple. \u201cHere,\u201d she whispered. Her finger was touching her lips. \u201cThere\u2019s a tear.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his lips toward hers and barely touching them, ran his tongue over her upper lip. \u201cNo, there\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019re done crying now.\u201d He put his hands around her tiny waist and pulled her onto his mouth, kissing her deeply and tenderly. She answered him with desire, hot and strong, opening her lips under his. He thought he might feel tears in his own eyes, she felt so wonderful in his arms, tasted so magnificent on his lips. He wondered if this was just another of his fantasies; he further wondered if it was real, if it would disappear once again before he could grab on to it. Feeling her body against his, her tongue in his mouth, her hands running up and down his back, he hoped beyond hope that she was real and he wouldn\u2019t wake up and find she\u2019d just been another dream.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were gone forever,\u201d he said against her lips.</p><p>\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t gone. I wish I\u2019d stayed....\u201d</p><p>He covered her mouth in a deep, desperate kiss that lasted forever, holding her so close he was afraid he\u2019d crush her. He wanted to say things to her, but that would mean releasing her lips, and he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. All those weeks, all those long nights of wishing he could have made things different for them. All that regret, thinking that if he hadn\u2019t moved so fast, he could have brought them together differently, with more success. He should have taken his time, courted her, wooed her. He was a fool, not getting her phone number and last name before he got her body. He should have brought her slowly and confidently into his heart, erasing her doubts. And yet he couldn\u2019t imagine how it could have been different\u2014they\u2019d both been so steamed up. So ready.</p><p>He was ready again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNikki,\u201d he whispered, \u201cyou\u2019re doing it to me again.\u201d He covered her mouth and kissed her, deep and long.

When you\u2019re not, it\u2019s just awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to give it a chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, nodding.</p><p>\u201cI realize that sometimes things don\u2019t work out the way we want them to. I\u2019ve been down that road and so have you. But I\u2019m not going to string you along. I\u2019ll never lie to you. Do you believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Do you believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to run out on me again, without any explanation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do that again, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do anything else, you know. You can tell me you were mistaken. Tell me you changed your mind and you don\u2019t feel it anymore. Anything but disappearing without a word. If it\u2019s over for you, you have to finish it. Do we have a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d she said against his lips.</p> <p>\u201cWhere do Vanni and Paul think you are?\u201d he asked her in a hoarse whisper.</p><p>\u201cWith you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, Joe. I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her off her feet, kissing her. \u201cIf you want me to make love to you, I will. But only if you want me to. And only if you think it can be the beginning of something, not the end.\u201d</p><p>She locked her hands behind his neck and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re something, you know that? You\u2019re not a regular guy. Usually this is about the time the guy says something like, don\u2019t try to pin me down, baby. Guys don\u2019t usually start right off saying they want a chance at something that lasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He grinned. Then he shrugged, thinking about his boys, his friends. There was a time almost all of them were that other guy\u2014the kind who\u2019s dodging commitment. Now look at them. \u201cYou over that idiot who let you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so over him, I could laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cLet\u2019s go someplace we can wake up together.\u201d</p><p>It amazed Joe he could sleep at all, but he did. Holding Nikki in his arms through the night, feeling her sweet, warm body against his, he was at peace. When he woke beside her, it was as though the future had been decided for him. He was dead in love with her, amazed at the way he had only to touch her, kiss her, and she would unfold, wanting him as much as he wanted her. Now it was only a question of what she would decide about them. But he trusted their pact\u2014they would be honest with each other. No more running away.</p><p>Joe slipped out of bed in the predawn, the sun barely rising. He thought he\u2019d start the coffee, make love to her again while it brewed, and they could watch the sunrise together. They could talk about when they\u2019d see each other next. He started the coffee. He stared at the coffeepot while it began to brew. The smell of the pot was suspect\u2014he wondered if it was old. Then he lifted his head. He looked at the clock on the microwave. Nine-thirty. He sniffed the air. Oh shit. He unplugged the coffeepot and ran out onto the porch, naked. He thought it was predawn because the sun streaming through the windows was so dim\u2014but it was smoke in the air. \u201cNikki,\u201d he yelled, running back into the cabin. \u201cNikki! Wake up! Fire!\u201d</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>T he town had become a base camp for firefighters and the acrid odor of smoke hung in the air. When Joe pulled into town, he had to park back beyond the church. He held on to Nikki\u2019s hand and ran with her to the center of town. There were many Cal Fire trucks, Hot Shot transports, Cal Fire firefighters and dozens of firefighters who Joe knew at a glance would be inmates trained in firefighting. There were flatbeds loaded with gear, water tenders and trucks for hauling firefighters, paramedic rigs, dozens of men in hard hats and yellow turnouts, boots, packs of gear on their backs, and a tent pitched in the middle of the street, beside it an ambulance. The street was wide enough for a helicopter to land for medical airlift.</p><p>On the porch, among many men Joe had never seen before, were his friends. Jack was pulling on yellow turnouts, slipping the suspenders over his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cJoe,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you were still here. I knew you intended to leave for Oregon at the crack of dawn.\u201d He glanced at Nikki and couldn\u2019t suppress a quick grin. He gave her a nod.</p><p>\u201cStill here. What\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWind shifted. It\u2019s headed this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d</p><p>Zeke stepped forward and handed him some gear, which he took. \u201cWe\u2019re getting in it, bud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watching it from Fresno. Just after midnight it looked like it could threaten my favorite hunting grounds, so I fired up the truck and started driving.\u201d</p><p>Stephens walked out of the bar, already dressed out, a big doughnut in his hand. \u201cNot before he got everyone out of bed,\u201d he said.</p><p>Joe immediately started getting into his gear. He pulled the suspenders over his shoulders. Zeke and Josh were professional firefighters and paramedics, the rest of them trained volunteers\u2014Cal Fire could use them. It would be a lot of fetching and carrying, digging, removing vegetation, but every hand helped.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Nikki asked Joe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can to help. You want to go home? Go out to Vanni\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, Mel stepped onto the porch. She was wearing a white doctor\u2019s coat, something Joe had never seen her do before. There was a stethoscope around her neck. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked her, lifting his chin toward her as he pulled heavy gloves out of the pockets.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re helping in the first-aid station set up here. Since these guys don\u2019t know us\u2014me and Doc\u2014we have to be identifiable by uniform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the kids?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLittle ones are having morning naps in the back,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI think Christopher is standing watch. Paige is in charge of the kids while Mel works medical and Brie attempts to keep the food and water coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help her,\u201d Nikki said. She put a quick kiss on Joe\u2019s cheek and whispered in his ear, \u201cI love you, too. Please be careful.\u201d Then she headed quickly into the bar while he followed her with his eyes, a stupid grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s help from Cal Fire if Brie and Nikki can\u2019t keep up with it,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIf necessary, they\u2019ll evacuate the town. We\u2019re hoping that won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>Before long, Preacher was on the porch, already dressed in his gear. Paige was beside him, holding their new baby. He bent down, kissed his wife and daughter, and headed down the porch toward the waiting truck. Jack walked after him, snagging his arm. \u201cMaybe you should stay, Preach. In case these women and children have to be taken out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are people to help them out of here. I don\u2019t let you go in anywhere alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a big boy,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Preacher straightened and glowered. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Mel walked off the porch and toward the truck that would carry the volunteers away. She watched as the marines climbed on\u2014Zeke, Phillips, Stephens. Mike, Paul, Preacher, Joe and Jack followed them. A truck came flying into town, horn honking. Corny, also a professional firefighter, climbed out and yelled, \u201cHey! Forget anyone?\u201d</p><p>Greetings ripped the air. \u201cWhat about that new baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, she\u2019s not so new anymore. We had her two days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your wife let you out of town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? She told me to get my ass down here and help.\u201d He grinned, pulling his own gear out of the truck bed. \u201cShe\u2019s got her mother\u2014I\u2019m just in the way now. I have years with those kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother girl, huh?\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I know I have a boy in me. I just know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better keep that to yourself for a while, pal,\u201d someone advised.</p><p>There were also locals\u2014Doug Carpenter, Fish Bristol, Buck Anderson and two of his sons. All certified volunteer firefighters.</p><p>Everyone but Jack was in the truck. He went to his wife, leaned down and kissed her lips. \u201cWhen they tell you it\u2019s time, gather up the kids and get out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to come to that, Jack. It can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if I can leave this place....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do it. Keep them safe. And have someone get Ricky\u2019s grandma out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll watch out for Lydie, but I\u2019m waiting for you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m waiting right here. I\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re done and Virgin River will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelinda, don\u2019t you dare take any chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou come back as soon as you can.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t get rid of me.\u201d He slipped an arm around her waist and pulled her up to his mouth. \u201cYou taste too good.\u201d He grinned. \u201cBehave yourself.\u201d</p><p>Jack climbed into the truck and sat next to Joe. \u201cLooks like maybe you got some things straightened out,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cMight have a start on it. How\u2019d you round up all these old boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive of us were already here,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe these other guys. They must never have to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe few. The proud,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThe soon-to-be jobless if we don\u2019t knock this shit off.\u201d</p><p>It took a half hour to get to their area, the fire spreading toward them. Here there were steam shovels, trucks and water tenders parked along the road. All the firefighters, including the volunteers, had their gear on their backs\u2014food, water, survival gear. They were assigned jobs\u2014chain saws for cutting down trees or removing branches, Pulaskis and drag-spoons. They were herded up an old abandoned logging road with the rest of the hand crew. The farther they went, the thicker the air got, the more sparks were flying. They were organized into a line, some of them felling huge trees while hand crews were cutting boughs off felled pines to decrease the fuel to the fire. Still others were digging a wider gap to separate the tree line from the burning forest, digging out vegetation, throwing dirt on small pockets of spreading fire. Water tenders were driving farther back to spray down the small fires started by blowing sparks and embers. Jack walked all the way up to the end of the line and started turning earth. \u201cI\u2019m getting too old for this shit,\u201d he said, throwing dirt to cover the felled trees and chopped boughs.</p><p>\u201cWe all are, man,\u201d Paul said. He looked up. \u201cYou think we could get one frickin\u2019 cloud in the sky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and pray,\u201d Jack suggested.</p><p>The general drove up to the bar and walked inside. The first thing he saw was Brie, her baby niece swaddled in a carrier around her front, setting up pitchers of water on the bar for firefighters. He heard the sound of a baby crying in the back, in Preacher\u2019s quarters. He went behind the bar and dived right in. \u201cI have an idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you and Paige take the kids out to the ranch. It\u2019s surrounded by flat land and river\u2014no danger there. I\u2019ll handle the bar.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMel can\u2019t leave and I have her nursing baby right here,\u201d Brie said. \u201cShe\u2019s been treating minor injuries with paramedics and has to be on hand for more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe air here isn\u2019t the best for these kids. I have someone I can call to help. You should get the little ones out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...Let me ask her.\u201d</p> <p>Brie took the general\u2019s suggestion to Mel and she thought about it for less than a minute, then nodded. \u201cThe kids will be safer there. Can you, Paige and Nikki load them up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But I hate to take them away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should go, he\u2019s right. You can set up a nursery there, with Vanni. We\u2019ll be fine here with Walt\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>Mel watched from the first-aid station while the women carried the children to Preacher\u2019s and Jack\u2019s trucks with Walt\u2019s help, moving car seats around and tucking them in. Into the back went a playpen, port-a-crib, infant seats and baby swing, diaper bags and paraphernalia. Little Davie and Emma, Christopher and Dana Marie. Then they pulled slowly out of town.</p><p>Mel hoped it would occur to Paige or Vanni to nurse little Emma; Emma needed the breast. She was young and vulnerable and Mel wouldn\u2019t hesitate to nurse a friend\u2019s baby at a time like this. Mel felt a tear run down her cheek as they went. She wiped at it impatiently. This was an emergency; they\u2019d have to make do. Vanni, Brie, Nikki and Paige would keep the babies and Christopher all safe. That was the most important thing.</p> <p>Then Jack will be home and we\u2019ll go get them, she told herself.</p><p>The morning flew by with trucks full of firefighters passing through, stopping for first aid or food and water. They\u2019d be driven out and another crew would pass through. Sometimes the firefighters were new and wearing clean gear, sometimes they were dirty, exhausted, parched and hungry men. Most of them were inmates, felons trained in firefighting with plenty of law enforcement on hand, backing up Cal Fire. Mel had often wondered how many of them tried to run away while on this duty. But then, this program would likely come to an end if many did.</p><p>She took a break to walk into the bar. To her surprise, behind the bar she found the general and Muriel. The woman gave her a bright smile.</p><p>\u201cHey, girl,\u201d Walt said. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce water, thanks, if you still have ice. I\u2019m so dry. I think it\u2019s the smoke in the air. It\u2019s not exactly thick, but it works on the nose and throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Mel?\u201d Muriel asked.</p> <p>\u201cA little tense today. Thanks for coming to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019m glad to. You have quite the circus out there.\u201d</p><p>Mel gratefully drank down half her water. \u201cWe do, at that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to the kitchen. I\u2019ve been making sandwiches, the only cooking I\u2019m capable of. I just about have a big tray ready to bring out. Cal Fire has rations, but they\u2019re running low and we can pitch in. How about if we set up on the porch, along with water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Mel said. \u201cHang on to the bottled water till the well runs low\u2014we might need it later. I\u2019m going to call the ranch, see how the kids are doing.\u201d</p><p>She went to the phone. While Vanni assured her everyone was fine, she could hear Emma crying in the background. Amazing, she thought, how you knew your baby\u2019s cry. It almost made her cry. Worse than that, it made her milk let down and she had to make a dash for the bathroom, open her shirt and lean over the sink. Women\u2019s bodies, she found herself thinking. It was a miracle, the way they worked. Come back, Jack, she thought. We have to get back to our children!</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d Muriel was calling, tapping at the door. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019ll be right out.\u201d When she opened the door, she found the older woman standing there, waiting, a concerned frown on her face.</p> <p>\u201cI saw you run for the bathroom, and I thought maybe you were sick. All this smoke in the air...\u201d</p><p>Mel chuckled. \u201cI called Walt\u2019s house to check on the kids and heard Emma crying. It\u2019s been too long since I nursed her. In seconds, I was dripping,\u201d she said, pulling aside the white coat to show a large round wet spot on her breast. \u201cI hope they get this fire under control before I explode.\u201d</p><p>Muriel smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t have children. And I guess you need to get back to yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be much longer. Really, this has to be resolved soon. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mel,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of wood out there. It\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mel said weakly. \u201cYeah it sure is.\u201d</p><p>Walt was making sandwiches with Muriel. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been hanging around your place, riding with you, throwing the stick for your dogs, and I never asked you about the husbands. Like, how many? And why you think it didn\u2019t work out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I feel like telling you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAw, you\u2019ll tell me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re just that kinda gal. And I told you about my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, still slapping sandwiches together. \u201cThe synopsis. The first one was fifteen years older than me, my agent. He\u2019s still my agent\u2014he married the talent, not the person I was. He was very ambitious for me, for us both. He still thinks I divorced him because of his age, but I divorced him because all he cared about was my career. I don\u2019t think he could tell you my favorite color...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYellow,\u201d Walt said.</p><p>Her head snapped around and she stared at him. \u201cYellow,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat was easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all around and you wear it a lot. Red\u2019s important, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said, shocked. She shook herself. \u201cOkay, number two hit, number three cheated, number four had a child he failed to mention, number five\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, wait,\u201d Walt said. \u201cIs this going to go on for a real long time?\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you look it up on the Internet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not,\u201d he said, almost insulted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re stopping at five. He had a substance-abuse problem. I didn\u2019t know about it beforehand, obviously. I tried to help, but I was in the way\u2014he needed to be on his own. That\u2019s when I decided that, really, I should quit doing that. Marrying. But please understand, it\u2019s not all my fault\u2014Hollywood doesn\u2019t exactly have a reputation for long, sturdy relationships. I did the best I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDo you say that because you have no doubt? Or are you being a sarcastic ass to a poor woman who had to go through five miserable husbands?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. Then he slipped an arm around her waist and kissed her cheek. It was the first time he\u2019d been that bold. He\u2019d been riding with her, showing up at her house to drink wine while they sat on lawn chairs in front of the bunkhouse, even talking to her almost daily on the phone, but he hadn\u2019t gotten physical. \u201cThe Army was rough on families, too. I was lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re just better at it than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s possible, too,\u201d he said. Then he smiled at her.</p><p>The men fighting the fire grew dry and tired. They\u2019d worked their way into the forest along a line that had grown wide and deep. Jack leaned against his shovel as Mike Valenzuela passed by with a chain saw, headed up the line to cut boughs from more felled trees. He paused for a drink and took a few deep breaths before bending to his job of turning earth, tossing dirt onto a growing pile that formed a small dike against the forest. Mike moved down the line of men, out of sight. Jack wiped his forehead and put the shovel back to the ground.</p><p>Then something subtle happened. The slight breeze that Jack had been feeling on the back of his neck changed to a hot wind that hit him full in the face. Frowning, he began to walk up the line and around the curve in the direction Valenzuela had gone, looking for the source of that sudden heat. As the logging road went deeper into the trees, the volunteers thinned out and the professionals were the ones moving closer to the fire.</p><p>A murmur went up among the men and sparks filled the air. The line of men that had been winding around the hill to his left began to move toward him, then past him. Jack didn\u2019t see Mike anywhere, so he walked a little farther. He quickly saw that there was no one back there. Behind him, from where he had been, he heard, \u201cMove out, move out, move out!\u201d</p><p>Firefighters who had been behind him were beginning to jog down the road. He heard a roar, sparks filling the air. The fire that they\u2019d been chasing was coming toward them, hard and fast. In front of him was dense smoke, behind him\u2014the logging road from whence he\u2019d come, and to his left, a deep ravine. He turned to move out down the road when there was a blast\u2014an ignited tree that had been burning exploded about ten feet into the forest and sent a shower of sparks and debris over the road in a huge flash. A two-hundred-foot sequoia was on fire not five feet away from where he stood. He took a dive in the direction of the ravine and began to crawl madly toward it as a burning tree came down and flames shot over his head.</p><p>At the command to move out, the firefighters and volunteers were being quickly herded back down the hill to the road, where trucks were waiting to evacuate them. Paul was craning his neck, looking for Jack. He\u2019d seen him move into the trees, but he wasn\u2019t back yet. Then sparks began to fly and a roaring sound could be heard. Mike Valenzuela jumped up on the truck beside some of his boys. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jack?\u201d Paul asked him.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen him.\u201d He looked around. \u201cOne of the other trucks?\u201d</p><p>Paul jumped out of the truck and started back up the road, but he was grabbed by the crew chief and pushed toward the truck.</p><p>\u201cOne of our boys is in there,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one in there,\u201d the chief said. \u201cEveryone was cleared out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him go in that direction!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one back there, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anyone there, they\u2019ll get him,\u201d he said, pointing to a long line of firefighters making fast tracks out of the burning forest. Right at the back of their column was an explosion, sending debris and sparks flying over their heads. Paul found himself shoved into the truck, landing in a heap, while their captain yelled, \u201cLet\u2019s go! Move out!\u201d And the truck jerked into motion.</p><p>Paul sat up in the bed of the truck and watched as all these yellow-clad, hard-hatted men scrambled into the next truck, and then a third, and as each one filled up, they drove pell-mell down the logging road to the asphalt. He had to be in one of those other trucks, Paul thought. He had to be.</p><p>Two planes flew in low, dumping retardant on the fire, a bright red powder. Flames leaped toward the aircraft as they disappeared over the forest.</p><p>When they got to the safety zone, the marines began looking for Jack, going to every truck, but he was nowhere. Paul told the captain what he\u2019d seen, that Jack might still be back there.</p><p>\u201cBuddy, if he didn\u2019t get out with that last crew, he might not\u2019ve gotten out.\u201d</p><p>Panicked, Paul said to Joe, \u201cWe have to find him, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going to look, huh? It\u2019s coming this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got to be around here somewhere.\u201d Paul grabbed the firefighter\u2019s arm. \u201cWas there any other way out?\u201d</p><p>He just shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has to be another way out. He wouldn\u2019t do that\u2014he wouldn\u2019t go in there if it was too hot. He\u2019s too smart for that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPal, the wind shifted and ate up acres in minutes. We\u2019re just going to have to wait it out, see if he turns up. He\u2019s not the only one unaccounted for. Search and Rescue is on it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAw, fuck,\u201d Paul said. He got tears in his eyes. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d He looked at Joe. \u201cAfter all we\u2019ve gotten through? That wouldn\u2019t happen, would it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The firefighters and volunteers moved down the line to a new location, but now that the fire was moving in another direction, away from Virgin River, other crews to the northwest were taking over. A few hours later, the sun setting, the chief was ready to pull his camp out of Virgin River, relocate the base camp and send the Virgin River volunteers home.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t leave,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cNot till we figure out where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one came out the other side, Preach. And he\u2019s not here. I think maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cNo. He made it out, we just can\u2019t find him. We\u2019ll just keep looking. We\u2019ll go back to where we saw him last, as close as we can safely get, set up a perimeter, look for a trail. We keep looking. That clear?\u201d</p><p>It was quiet for a moment until someone said, \u201cClear, Preach. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>By five o\u2019clock, the firefighters were moving out of Virgin River, but the men had not returned. The acrid smell of smoke was dissipating, finally moving in the other direction. By six o\u2019clock the town had grown eerily quiet and by seven, clouds began to roll in from the coast.</p> <p>Paige, Brie and Nikki brought the children back to town and Mel was at long last able to nurse Emma and cuddle David for a while. She settled them into playpens and makeshift beds in Paige\u2019s quarters. Walt and Muriel continued to work the kitchen and bar, keeping an eye on the TV for local news updates, convinced that the men would return soon, hungry. By ten o\u2019clock, still no word from their men, Mel saw the first few drops of rain fall on the dusty street outside the bar. She leaned out of the porch with her palm up and smiled as it grew wet. She stayed on the porch and watched, the smell of rain like the answer to a prayer.</p><p>She sat in one of the Adirondack chairs on Jack\u2019s porch and remembered the early days, before she married Jack, before the babies came. Back when she was alone and sure she\u2019d never have love in her life again. Jack, so large and powerful, could have swept her up in his strong arms and devoured her, but he\u2019d been patient, so gentle. He\u2019d waited for her to say it was time, that she was ready to feel something that didn\u2019t hurt. And then his hands on her, his lips, had drawn from her the most amazing response she\u2019d ever felt. A love so sure, so dependable, so constant. Jack didn\u2019t do anything halfway. He\u2019d been a carefree bachelor, a lover of many women, until Mel. And then he belonged only to her. A committed partner.</p><p>You should never be afraid of anything while you\u2019re my wife. It\u2019s my job to make sure you\u2019re never afraid.</p><p>I\u2019m a little afraid right now, Jack, she thought.</p><p>At midnight, she stuck her head into the bar and found Muriel slumped in a chair with her head on the table while Walt still stood behind the bar, watching the news on the new TV. Ready. Waiting. \u201cGo lie down somewhere, Mel,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll call you the second they come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard anything on the news?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re saying the fire\u2019s contained. And now, with the rain, they should be on top of it before long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why aren\u2019t they back?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019re still needed for something,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe cleanup or something. Go. Sleep.\u201d</p><p>Jack never slept while she worked, just in case she needed him\u2014which she sometimes had. She shook her head. \u201cI won\u2019t sleep until I have my man back,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s on his way.\u201d Inside, she could feel each step he took toward her, though her heart was beating suspiciously fast. But she was sure. He was on his way. Maybe he was out there looking for someone...</p><p>She remembered the first time she\u2019d met these remarkable men, these marines who would never abandon each other. She fell instantly under their collective spell\u2014their humor, camaraderie, pure zest for life, these men who loved their women and the life they could bring forth. They were fun and lusty, brave and loyal. Jack had proudly sent Rick off to become one of them.</p><p>Jack had fathered Rick in every way he could, with as much devotion and strength as he would give the fruit of his own loins. She remembered how he had held the boy against the grief of losing his own child, his heart breaking into pieces. Her man, he had so much love inside him, it was amazing his chest didn\u2019t explode.</p><p>I\u2019ll never let you go, Mel. I want you to trust me, you know you\u2019re safe with me.</p><p>\u201cI trust you,\u201d she said aloud, though there was no one to hear. \u201cI love you. I trust you. And I know you\u2014you\u2019ll never give up.\u201d</p> <p>He had saved her life when it was bleeding out of her after Emma\u2019s birth. She was only semiconscious, but she heard his desperate, pleading words. You\u2019re my life! Don\u2019t do this, Mel. Stay with me. Don\u2019t you leave me!</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you leave me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d</p><p>As if you could get rid of me now.</p><p>Dawn found her still sitting on the porch, alert. She had spent a very long night thinking about her husband. He had so many faces; a fierce and dangerous expression for an enemy, a threat. A soft and tender expression when he turned his eyes to her. A sweet pride when he held their children. A joyful gleam when he was with his friends.</p><p>She remembered when he had first talked her into those stolen kisses, deep and meaningful and passionate. It had been hard to resist him, his allure was so penetrating. And how fortuitous, because that same desire had given her the children\u2014she just couldn\u2019t say no to Jack. His love was blinding, it was so bold.</p><p>Finally, finally, a truck pulled into town, a farmer\u2019s truck. In the back sat their men, dirty and exhausted. She stood on the porch and watched as one by one, they crumbled out of the truck. Mike came up the porch steps. The black ash on his face was split by damp tracks of tears.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jack?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t find him, Mel. We looked all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d she asked with a nervous laugh. \u201cYou lost him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were evacuating the area and he didn\u2019t come out. There was a sudden explosion. Fire swept over the road.\u201d He grabbed her upper arm. \u201cMel, he might have been trapped. Three firefighters were lost in a blast of fire when the wind shifted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not Jack,\u201d she said, shaking her head. Her eyes were perfectly clear. \u201cNo, Jack\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He pulled her into his arms, but she kept hers at her sides. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Preacher came up the steps. His eyes were bloodshot, weary and sad. His face was covered with soot, as were his turnouts. He stood before her and hung his head as if ashamed. She knew him so well\u2014he wouldn\u2019t be able to live with himself if he thought he let Jack down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. He\u2019s coming,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be pissed, but he\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>One by one they approached her, touching her, hugging her, some of them with tears running out of their eyes. Before long the general was on the porch and, seeing the men, went to rouse Muriel and the younger women. But Mel was unmoved. \u201cNo,\u201d she said over and over. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. If anything had happened to him, I\u2019d know it. I\u2019d feel it. He\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going back out there after some fluids and rest,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out what happened. No matter what, we\u2019ll bring him back.\u201d Then, hanging his head, he walked into the bar. It wasn\u2019t long before the sound of Brie\u2019s cry split the dawn and caused Mel to stiffen her spine. But she grabbed on to Joe\u2019s arm as he passed and said, \u201cTell her. Her brother\u2019s all right. He\u2019s coming. Tell her.\u201d</p><p>Joe pulled Mel against him and held her. \u201cHoney, I\u2019m not sure about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. No one understood. If Jack were gone, she would feel it\u2014there would be a deep, dark, hollow place in her. For just a second she was reminded that when her first husband, Mark, had been killed, she hadn\u2019t had any kind of premonition. There had been no warning, no deep feeling. But she banished the thought\u2014it was different with Jack. It had always been different with Jack. \u201cHe\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>J ack sat by the side of a deserted farm road at dawn, his ankle a mess, his face scorched. He was dehydrated, weak. His turnouts were covered with flame retardant, peppered with little holes from flying sparks, and he wondered how long he should rest before he just started walking again. Make that limping\u2014he\u2019d wrecked the ankle pretty bad. The area had been completely evacuated and it was unlikely anyone would be driving along this road until either Forestry or Cal Fire came this way. By that time he could be passed out, if not dead.</p><p>Then, against all odds, he saw the dust from a moving vehicle. He dragged himself to his feet, but he was dizzy and wobbly, his dehydration made worse by the dryness from smoke in the air. He placed himself in the center of the road. He decided he\u2019d rather get run over than passed by. Who would pass someone in firefighter\u2019s turnouts? Only the devil himself.</p><p>Then the devil himself in a dark pickup with tinted windows came to a stop just inches from him. \u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Jack muttered to himself, his mouth dry as cotton.</p><p>The grower who\u2019d crossed his path too often in the last couple of years opened the driver\u2019s door and stepped out. \u201cJesus. You\u2019re like a bad dream,\u201d the guy said to Jack. \u201cYou look like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? You\u2019re not exactly my favorite person, either,\u201d Jack returned thickly.</p><p>\u201cHow bad are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirsty,\u201d Jack said. \u201cJust thirsty. Just let me siphon out of the radiator tank and you can go,\u201d he said, insane though the notion was. He was insanely thirsty.</p><p>The guy, minus the Shady Brady and a little smudged with what could have been ash, sighed deeply and walked around the front of the truck. He opened the passenger door and said, \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got water?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah! I got water! Just get in!\u201d Jack limped toward the truck. \u201cYou said you weren\u2019t hurt,\u201d Shady Brady said, eyeing the limp.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mostly just thirsty,\u201d Jack said, walking very badly.</p><p>\u201cYou break it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. You ever hear a sprain\u2019s worse than a break? We\u2019re gonna find out...\u201d</p><p>Shady Brady laughed in spite of himself. \u201cChrist, you\u2019re a piece of work. Get in.\u201d</p><p>Jack wearily pulled himself into the truck, not easy\u2014it was high, he was weak and the ankle was real bad. He\u2019d hurt it right off, taking that dive into the ravine.</p><p>When the driver was settled behind the wheel, he reached behind him into the extended cab and grabbed a bottled water, handing it to Jack. \u201cTake it slow or you\u2019ll puke in my truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how to do this,\u201d Jack said, then guzzled the water fast enough to make the concern a reality. In fact he belched and hiccuped a few times and lowered his window. But it was okay; the water stayed down. He leaned his head back and said, \u201cOh man. Long night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you end up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got separated from the crew. Wind shifted, a tree exploded, I had to take a dive and run for it. But with no stars because of the smoke, I have no idea where I am. I walked all night.\u201d He guzzled more water. \u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>The guy laughed. \u201cGetting the hell out of here. Listen, I\u2019ll leave you by the county road where you\u2019ll get picked up. I\u2019ll leave you water, but I can\u2019t go back that way. I\u2019m all done there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that before....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this time it\u2019s the real deal. I\u2019m so outta here. You\u2019ll be all right. No one\u2019s going to drive by a firefighter, even though you could just as easily be an inmate on the run. Especially the way you put yourself in the middle of the road\u2014nice touch.\u201d</p><p>They drove in silence awhile; Jack rehydrated himself and Shady Brady just drove at a dangerously high speed on the deserted road. It was only about fifteen minutes before he came to an intersection with the county road; it would have taken Jack most of the day to get this far on his ankle\u2014if he didn\u2019t collapse or drop dead first.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be cars along this road, don\u2019t worry.\u201d He reached behind him and grabbed a couple of bottled waters. \u201cStay off the ankle, go slow, ration the water\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in the desert,\u201d Jack said irritably.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Just wait for a ride. I have to go, man. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p><p>Jack narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be just a hundred percent good or a hundred percent bad? Why do you have to keep me all confused all the time?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cMy specialty\u2014confusion. Listen\u2014that fire was set. I can\u2019t prove it, but all I\u2019m lacking are the facts. People died. Far as I\u2019m concerned, death is against the rules.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are, man,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHalf the time I see you, you really piss me off. The other half, you come through. And you\u2019re a marine\u2014I saw the devil dog on your arm. But there are shitty marines out there, so I didn\u2019t let that influence me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get out,\u201d he said. \u201cStay off the leg as much as possible, I guarantee a ride will come along. Since we won\u2019t see each other again, it would be better for me if you didn\u2019t talk it around that I picked you up. I\u2019d really like to go up in a puff of smoke right now. So to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should tell the police what you said, about it being set...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what? When they find the source of that fire, there will be a body. That body had nothing to do with me. You do what you have to do\u2014but if you gossip a lot about this free ride, like I was there, and get some local growers looking for me, I\u2019m going to die. And like I said, I consider that against the rules.\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned. Okay\u2014here was a guy who was an illegal grower, but couldn\u2019t seem to resist saving lives like crazy, and didn\u2019t mind if the police heard what he\u2019d been up to, but didn\u2019t want the other growers in the area to catch wind...He must be in deep kimshie with some growers. Now, what kind of guy would he have to be to fear the growers more than the cops? \u201cNo reason I have to say anything, pal. Appreciate the ride. Slow down a little, huh? You\u2019re frickin\u2019 dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a hurry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. You wanna get there? Thanks for the ride. Try to stay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>Once the truck door was closed, he peeled out, leaving a cloud of dust in his wake.</p><p>The drizzle continued, steaming up the ground; it was still so hot. The hottest summer ever, made hotter by the burning forest.</p><p>Mel wouldn\u2019t leave the porch. Doc came to the bar, touched her forehead and asked her if she wouldn\u2019t lie down for just a few minutes. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boys said Search and Rescue are combing the area and they\u2019re getting ready to leave again, to look. We can wake you the second something is found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc, it\u2019s all right. I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep anyway.\u201d</p><p>Muriel tried to press a brandy into her hand, but she shook her head. She wanted to be sure she could feel everything, because she could still feel him. He might as well have his arms around her. And then she remembered her very first night in Virgin River, the horrible cabin, the torrential rain, and the brandy from Jack\u2019s bar that warmed her. She had snapped at him that she didn\u2019t find him amusing, she\u2019d had a terrible day. And he had only grinned and said, \u201cGood thing I have the cork out of the Remy, then.\u201d</p><p>And later, when he\u2019d held her as she cried over her dead husband. Then he undressed her, dried her off, gave her that brandy. She\u2019d had a huge emotional meltdown. If you\u2019re going to go down, go down big. You should be proud.</p> <p>His pride in her was the greatest gift. He told her often he was proud of the care she gave, proud of her commitment to helping wherever help was needed. When a man like Jack is proud of you, it means everything. She felt herself smiling.</p><p>The volume on the TV in the bar was turned up. She\u2019d never heard it so loud. She knew Jack\u2019s boys weren\u2019t resting, but glued to the news, hoping to catch something about the lost firefighters. They took turns on the porch with her, afraid to leave her alone, because they thought she was losing it. Quietly and stoically, but losing it. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she told them. \u201cReally, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Inside, the men were gearing up to leave again, stuffing down sandwiches for fuel, guzzling water to rehydrate. Mel accepted water, had her baby brought to her to nurse, held her son for a bottle, but she was determined. She stayed on the porch. She never once asked if there was any news of Jack.</p><p>The morning news reported there were three firefighters confirmed dead in the blaze, names being withheld pending notification. Talking quietly among themselves, the men conferred about how some notification could be on its way soon, and they would stay on in Virgin River as long as necessary, be there for Mel. They would help her lay him to rest and for as long as she needed them, someone would be there.</p><p>The men had had a break of a couple of hours, food and water, called their families to report that they were unharmed, and were almost ready to take their personal vehicles back to the area and continue the search. Joe and Paul each sat on either side of her, occasionally reaching for her hand. She stared straight ahead.</p><p>The sound of a vehicle brought her to her feet and she stood on the porch. The rain had stopped, the ground was wet, and an old pickup pulled into town, stopping in the middle of the street in front of the bar. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d Paul muttered, rising to his feet. Joe stumbled running into the bar.</p><p>Jack spilled out of the back, a huge smear of red flame retardant staining his body. He balanced on one foot, his other leg disabled in some way. As he reached back into the pickup for his gear, Mel serenely walked down the porch steps toward him. He tossed his gear to the ground and the pickup drove off with a toot of the horn. His face was black with soot, his eyes red and tearing, his lips pink and cracked from dryness. The turnouts he wore were speckled with holes made by flying embers.</p><p>Mel walked right into his open arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said, looking up at him.</p><p>He lowered his lips to softly kiss her forehead. \u201cSorry. I was held up. Goddamn truck left without me.\u201d He smiled down at her. \u201cDo you have any idea what you look like in jeans? Melinda, you just do it to me in jeans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone thought you were dead and you\u2019re talking about my butt again.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cThey\u2019re going to wish I was dead. I\u2019ve been walking for twenty-four hours and I\u2019m in a real mood.\u201d He brushed the hair back from her brow. \u201cWere you scared, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI knew you were coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>She touched her chest. \u201cYour heart beats in here. If it had stopped, I would have known. It did beat a little fast sometimes. Was it close, Jack?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, tightening his arms around her. \u201cIt was so close, I have blisters on my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent all night remembering every time you touched me. Every one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to make do on memories. I\u2019m going to touch you for many more years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d never leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019d walk out of hell to get back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Jack. You hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ankle. I took a fall into a ditch. I\u2019m not as agile as I was. I might\u2019ve really screwed it up, running on it. It really slowed me down\u2014and I was so ready to feel you against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she asked, wiping at the gooey red stuff on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cFlame retardant. It got dumped right on me. Knocked me down\u2014but there was a path out. Then I had to run on this damn ankle. It was awful. And then I got lost. You can get even worse lost at night when you can\u2019t see the stars because of the trees and smoke. I think I\u2019m going to give up firefighting.\u201d</p><p>She touched his face, which appeared to be sunburned beneath the soot and ash. He winced. Then he bent down and crossed his arms under her bottom and lifted her up to his face. \u201cKiss me. Gimme a taste.\u201d She lowered her lips to his for a kiss that was deep and strong. Behind them, a cheer went up from all the marines gathered on the porch. But Jack took his time, moving tenderly over her lips, grateful to dive into her sweet love once more. He\u2019d been wanting to kiss her for twenty-four hours and he wasn\u2019t going to be rushed. Not by them, not by anything. He hated the thought of letting her go, as in love with her today as that very first day. More.</p><p>\u201cYou taste like soot,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou taste so good.\u201d He jerked his head in the direction of his bar, his boys. \u201cI hate when they do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m starting to get used to it.\u201d She smiled. And she kissed him again.</p><p>As anxious as Jack was to get home, he needed a few minutes alone with Mike Valenzuela. They sequestered themselves in the RV behind the bar. Jack told only Mike the details of his rescue, and stayed there while Mike called the sheriff, repeating the story as well as the license-plate number. When Mike hung up, he slowly turned to look at Jack.</p><p>\u201cWell, they were ahead of you. A couple of growers\u2014partners\u2014had a little lover\u2019s spat. One was shot, the other set him on fire to conceal evidence, thus the fire. They\u2019re investigating a drug-related murder covered by arson. A suspect was arrested trying to get away,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>Jack swallowed. \u201cWas it our guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing here, but if it was our guy, he would not have stopped for you. In fact, he might\u2019ve put a bullet in your head to keep you from talking to the police. He definitely wouldn\u2019t have told you anything about the fire. Jack, that guy isn\u2019t what we think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we think?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cThat he\u2019s an ordinary grower. He might even be law enforcement, and if he is, they\u2019ll pull him in, relocate him and we\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>Jack stood up. \u201cWell. I guess that\u2019s it, then. The way he was driving, he probably wrapped himself around a tree before he got out of the county. I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong sleep. And, Valenzuela. Thanks. For looking for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just what we do. What you do. I\u2019m just glad we didn\u2019t have to bring a crispy critter home to Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Me, too.\u201d</p><p>Jack, Preacher, Mike and Paul went to their homes, their wives, to their showers and then their beds for a long, clean sleep. The others had too much of a drive ahead to think about just taking it on after no sleep in twenty-four hours. Phillips and Stephens were headed for Reno and went over the mountain pass with a big thermos of strong coffee from the bar and two sets of eyes to stay on the road. Zeke and Corny took the night in Jack\u2019s guesthouse before tackling their long drives. Joe took Nikki back to the cabin.</p><p>That left Muriel and Walt with no instructions and a bar on their hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re done here,\u201d Walt said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t exactly clean the place, but the food\u2019s put away and the dishes done. We did our part.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI did my part,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cBy now Buff has exploded in his kennel and although Luce is an angel, it\u2019s possible she had a few accidents and ate my house out of boredom. She\u2019s a Lab. These things are inbred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreacher left keys. What do you say we lock up and give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m wrecked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrecked,\u201d she repeated. \u201cThat goes beyond tired.\u201d</p><p>Walt put a hand to the small of her back and escorted her out, locking the door behind them. He stood on the porch for a moment, looking at the sky. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you for coming to town, helping like you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my town, too, Walt. Now. And it was worth it. These are my guys, too, now. Not just yours.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cTrue. If you feed \u2019em, they\u2019re yours.\u201d He dropped his chin. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been in some real hot spots over the years. I came here for peace and quiet, but today wasn\u2019t either one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI grew up in these mountains,\u201d she informed him. \u201cIt gets dicey sometimes. It\u2019s not an easy life all the time. Beautiful, but there are issues. In the end, it\u2019s usually worth it. But, Walt, you shouldn\u2019t get the idea it\u2019s simple. It\u2019s not. It can get rugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saying beautiful isn\u2019t always easy?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s exactly the message, but I guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that you do,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been away a while. I had almost forgotten,\u201d she added. \u201cThis can be rough country. Fire\u2019s the worst, I think. We live in the middle of a lot of wood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you wonder, just for a second, whether it was worth it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Jack came back, all scraped up, scorched, and picked up his little wife like he did, almost as if he\u2019d been late from the store or something, it reminded me about what I love about this\u2014that these people face this stuff like it\u2019s just part of the package. They just man up, even the women. Everyone dives in, gets it done. It reminds me, if I\u2019m going to belong to a group of people, I want to belong to people like these. They\u2019re tough and resilient. They don\u2019t quit early. They can count on each other. They hang in. That\u2019s why I loved the Army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalt,\u201d she said, putting a hand on his chest. \u201cWe\u2019re just mountain people. We take what comes. The fact that it doesn\u2019t come easy? There\u2019s really not so much more to it than we don\u2019t give up. We fight. There\u2019s a lot to fight for here.\u201d</p><p>He looked down into his movie-star girlfriend\u2019s eyes. He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep tonight. Then tomorrow night, why don\u2019t I bring groceries to your place and fix you a decent dinner.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cAfraid you\u2019ll get celery sticks and hummus for food if you just come over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just think we deserve a good dinner, alone. And I might stay late.\u201d Then he grinned.</p><p>\u201cI might let you. I\u2019ll do the wine. Will you tell your daughter where you\u2019ll be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m having an awful lot of fun saying nothing about us.\u201d</p> <p>She lifted an eyebrow. \u201cWhat is there to say about us?\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her brow. \u201cLet\u2019s revisit that question after dinner tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Walt,\u201d she teased with a smile.</p><p>He gave her fanny a pat. \u201cRest up,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause now that I think about it, I\u2019m damn sure I\u2019m going to stay late.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
