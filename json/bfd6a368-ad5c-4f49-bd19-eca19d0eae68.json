Under her silk blouse, sweat dampened her back, and black spots danced at the edge of her vision. As her knees threatened to buckle, she tightened her grip on the curved wood. Will. Not. Show. Weakness. Another breath. She pretended to look around, stalling and hoping she\u2019d be able to walk.</p><p>Whispers skittered around the courtroom, but the jurors were silent, watching her with concern. The white-haired grocer\u2019s expression was outraged\u2014for her. The tiny housewife wiped tears from her face.</p><p>The prosecuting attorney stepped forward to help, but the jury\u2019s warmth had put strength back into Linda\u2019s body. She straightened, stepped down, and her legs held. Thank you, God. Surely she could walk to the door.</p> <p>She glanced at the defense attorney and his client\u2014the balding, older man in his European-cut suit and diamond-encrusted watch\u2014who was on trial for the murder of a nineteen-year-old college student.</p><p>Holly had been kidnapped. Enslaved like Linda.</p><p>Linda swallowed hard. She\u2019d held the sweet-faced girl as she\u2019d cried for her mother. She\u2019d told her it would be all right. She\u2019d lied. When the FBI raided an auction, freeing the slaves, it had been far too late for Holly.</p><p>The bastard sitting there so smugly had whipped her to death.</p><p>As Linda walked past, his patronizing gaze slid down her body, making her shudder and remember her own screams. Unable to escape, unable to fight. Beaten. Raped. She already felt dirty all the way to her core; his stare added another layer of filth. Ignoring the bile burning her throat, she forced herself to give him a dismissive look. Testifying had required all her strength, but she\u2019d done what she\u2019d come here to do. Chin up, head held high, she strode toward the exit.</p> <p>The sandy-haired FBI agent, Vance Buchanan, waited there. \u201cWell done,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cOnly a few steps farther.\u201d He reached out to assist her.</p><p>She flinched away.</p><p>As his hand dropped and he opened the door, she cursed herself for showing weakness. But she\u2019d been a slave. She didn\u2019t want to be touched.</p><p>After the overcrowded courtroom, the fresh air in the hallway was bracing, and then suddenly too cold. Her legs went boneless, and she dropped with a jarring thump onto the wooden bench. When she pushed her hands between her knees to hide the trembling, it only made the shaking of her knees more obvious. The dancing black spots had returned. Lovely.</p><p>\u201cYou did great, Linda.\u201d Vance\u2019s voice was washed away by her pounding pulse, and she\u2014</p><p>\u201cGoddamn fool, she\u2019s shocky.\u201d A voice from her dreams grated across her nerves, snapping her into the present. The bench squeaked a complaint as someone sat beside her. Arms closed around her, trapping her.</p> <p>No! She shoved at his wide shoulders, panic rising like a flood tide.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move, girl. You need to be held. Slap me later.\u201d The rough growl of Sam\u2019s voice was the rumble of an 18-wheeler carrying a truckload of safety.</p><p>Not trapped. Sheltered. He was warm\u2014so, so warm. She sagged against him. I hate you.</p><p>\u201cThat a girl. Take a break for a second. You earned it.\u201d</p><p>His chest was a brick wall, his arms iron bands, not comfortable in the least. Her body didn\u2019t care, more secure than in the long, long months since she\u2019d been freed from the slavers. With Sam\u2019s arms around her, nothing would hurt her.</p><p>Except him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Davies?\u201d Vance asked.</p><p>\u201cKim told me the asshole who\u2019d killed their friend was being tried. I figured this one would testify.\u201d The silence that followed sounded accusing.</p> <p>Vance sighed. \u201cLinda didn\u2019t want to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I can see that.\u201d The dryness in the gravelly voice came through loud and clear.</p><p>When had she put her arms around his waist? She was gripping him as if he were a lifeline over an abyss. Her arms loosened.</p><p>His tightened. \u201cOne more minute, missy. Be a shame not to get your strength back before you bust my chops.\u201d</p><p>Another minute sounded...just right. As she rested her cheek against his chest, the lazy lub-dub of his heart tried to coax hers into slowing. His soft cotton shirt smelled of the outdoors, of hay and leather and sun. So very different from the stench of fear and sex. Of pain. Her stomach clenched.</p><p>He gave a hissing sound of annoyance.</p><p>She looked up.</p><p>In a face tanned to old leather, his eyes were a startling pale blue. His silvering hair needed a trim. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking, stop.\u201d He curved a hand over her nape and tucked her head back under his chin.</p><p>Okay. For a few more seconds, she\u2019d... What in the world was she doing? I hate this man. As her mind cleared, she tried to push away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>He grunted as if she\u2019d hit him, and released her instantly.</p><p>Expecting to see amusement in his gaze, she saw only concern. It didn\u2019t matter. She rose to her feet, rattled when he did the same. But he was the kind of man who\u2019d observe that old-fashioned courtesy. A gentleman sadist. His aura of confidence\u2014and menace\u2014was disconcerting. She took a step away from him.</p><p>Distance didn\u2019t help. He trapped her easily with the power of his gaze, his posture, his voice. \u201cI want you to call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, unable to give her refusal the strength it deserved. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you.\u201d The one hour of knowing him had been enough for her. He\u2019d seen right to her core, and she\u2019d learned how deep humiliation could go.</p><p>His hard mouth tightened, but he merely tapped her chin with a finger. \u201cSubmissives don\u2019t get what they want. They get what they need.\u201d He might as well have said the rest of what he was thinking: And you need me.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t. She wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Sam left his battered truck in the parking lot and strode across the street to the small city park. Beyond the palms lining the entrance, massive live oak trees cast dark pools of shade. The air was cool with a slight crispness. Almost into February, Tampa still had a few months before the daily rains would send the humidity to sauna-like levels.</p><p>He spotted Nolan King on a picnic bench across the green swath of grass. Sam glanced at his watch. Late. Linda\u2019s testimony had lasted longer than he\u2019d planned.</p><p>As Sam sidestepped a toddler chasing a beach ball, her mother on a park bench gave him a sharp look. He approved of her vigilance. The world held too many monsters. But Sam wasn\u2019t someone she needed to worry about. He might be a sadist, but he only played consensual games.</p><p>Except for one time.</p><p>The scene he\u2019d done at the slave auction with Linda hadn\u2019t been what he would call consensual. To lead the FBI to the auction, he\u2019d convinced the slavers he was a buyer and gotten himself an invitation. But the cops had needed time to block the roads, which left Raoul, his sub, and Sam in a nightmare. Wealthy buyers had roamed a ballroom, sampling the \u201cmerchandise\u201d\u2014the slaves chained to the walls.</p><p>Linda had been up for sale. Since Raoul\u2019s sub knew her, she\u2019d asked Sam to care for Linda. But there was no care to be had in a place like that. Disguised as a buyer, Sam\u2019s only hope was to pretend to check her out prior to buying her. To whip her himself. He couldn\u2019t risk telling her that he was a good guy and help was on the way.</p><p>Seeing Kim\u2019s nod of approval, Linda had known Sam wasn\u2019t a complete bastard. But was the scene consensual? Hardly. Not when her only choice had been him or another slaver.</p><p>Sam ran his hand through his hair. He was too damned old to play James Bond. He was a farmer, not a spy. He\u2019d done his best by her, and she\u2019d been the sweetest, most responsive submissive-masochist he\u2019d ever met. The chemistry between them had been a bonfire. She\u2019d trusted him, given him what he asked for, and in return, he\u2019d transformed what might have been a nightmare of pain into something wonderful for her.</p><p>And then he\u2019d made a mistake; to this day, he wasn\u2019t sure exactly what. He had ideas, but hell, he could be totally off base.</p><p>Sam sighed. For the past few months, Linda\u2019d lived out of state with a sister, and this morning, he\u2019d had her in his arms again. She\u2019d trusted him to hold her. The sound of her low voice, her citrus-lavender scent, her yielding body had been even better than his memories. Until she\u2019d pushed him away.</p><p>As Sam approached the picnic table, Nolan looked up. From a small cooler, the hard-faced Dom removed a Mountain Dew and handed it over. \u201cFigured you\u2019d need something to wipe the taste out of your mouth. How\u2019d the trial go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe goddamned defense attorney took his questions into the gutter trying to shake her. Bad enough she gets raped by the slavers. To get raped again by a sleazy interrogation?\u201d Sam popped the top as he sat. The icy drink washed the bitterness from his throat. \u201cI wanted to shove a boot in his foul mouth.\u201d</p><p>And then rip apart the balding slaver who\u2019d killed the youngster. Holly had only been nineteen\u2014the same age as his little girl. \u201cI\u2019m an adult now, Daddy,\u201d his pretty Nicole often reminded him. He growled under his breath. No matter what the law said, his daughter\u2019s life had barely begun. And because of the slavers, one young woman wouldn\u2019t grow any older. The police had found Holly\u2019s body in a ravine where the killer had dumped her like garbage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But after Linda\u2019s testimony, Sam had seen the bastard\u2019s conviction in the jurors\u2019 faces. And he wouldn\u2019t live long\u2014not once the other prisoners saw pictures of the sweet-faced college student. \u201cLinda held up like a trouper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay have less muscles, but women got more guts than most men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d They\u2019d endure where a man would give up and die.</p><p>As a light breeze swept the park with the scent of brine, Sam listened to the children on the swing set.</p> <p>\u201cPush me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook how high I can go.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed. He\u2019d needed the reminder of happiness. \u201cWhy the park?\u201d</p><p>Nolan jerked his chin to the left. \u201cGreat scenery.\u201d</p><p>Sam followed his gaze. Beth, Nolan\u2019s submissive, knelt nearby, planting bright yellow flowers in a newly tilled garden. The glint of her red hair reminded him how Linda\u2019s thick mane had brushed his fingers when he held her shoulders. Her hair had grown.</p> <p>Nolan\u2019s contented, possessive smile sent envy through Sam. He\u2019d never had that kind of happiness with a woman. Probably never would since just the thought of his ex-wife drove ice shards into his gut. But he had a good life now. Wanting more would be stupid. \u201cBeth ignoring you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I brought her lunch and made her take a break. She just went back to work.\u201d Nolan glanced at Sam. \u201cYou going to go after that submissive? Linda, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not interested.\u201d But dammit, the way she\u2019d clung to him said otherwise.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me why not?\u201d</p><p>Nolan\u2019s sub had been abused. He might have advice. Didn\u2019t matter. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they say I\u2019m closemouthed.\u201d</p> <p>Sam shrugged. Nolan didn\u2019t like to talk. Period. Sam just didn\u2019t talk about personal shit. Too risky. Back in \u2019Nam, trails often held trip wires and mines. He\u2019d seen friends blown to bits. Then when he married, he\u2019d learned booby traps could be made of confidences. Could kill the spirit instead.</p><p>And wasn\u2019t he a bitter fool on a sunny day? He nodded at the rolled-up sheaf of paper sitting on the table. \u201cThe plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. If they suit you, I can have the concrete guys start in another week.\u201d Nolan spread the paper out on the rough wood. \u201cI think you\u2019ll like the suggestions the architect made.\u201d</p><p>Sam rose to take a better look. Good timing for this. Construction of a new stable would keep him busy for a while. Give Linda a chance to settle back into her life.</p><p>Then he\u2019d see what was what.</p><p>As the breeze off the Gulf toyed with her hair, Linda wiggled her toes in the sand and listened to the hissing of the waves on the shore. Compared to the energetic Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico was wonderfully peaceful. Yet she felt distant, as if she were watching life through a frosted window in a frigid alpine castle. \u201cNice place.\u201d</p><p>Kim was settled in a weathered Adirondack chair with her German shepherd sprawled at her feet. \u201cIt is. I love Raoul\u2019s house, but his beach here is what saved my sanity.\u201d Her black hair spilled down her back as she tipped her face up to the sun. \u201cSooo, was Sam at the courthouse?\u201d</p><p>Odd how even her anger felt bottled up. \u201cI should wallop you for telling him.\u201d But how could she be mad? She and Kim had been slaves together, and then Kim had risked her life to free Linda. \u201cYes, he was at the courthouse.\u201d</p> <p>And he\u2019d been more overwhelming than she remembered. Heavens, if she had to see him again, couldn\u2019t he have been...less? Less strong, less commanding. In the last few months, couldn\u2019t he have picked up a potbelly and sagging chest?</p><p>Or at least been a jerk? Instead, he\u2019d simply held her. He\u2019d shown up just to be there for her, and how was she supposed to deal with that?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised he made it. Over the winter, he got grumpy.\u201d Kim dug her toes into the sand and flicked some at Linda. \u201cOkay, more grumpy than normal. Raoul says he hardly leaves his place except for business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBunch of acres. A ranch or farm or something.\u201d</p><p>A rancher. She might have guessed. When several gulls started bickering in loud screeches over a washed-up fish, the dog raised his head, ears pricked, his whole body tensing. He gave Kim an entreating look.</p><p>\u201cOh, fine. Go chase the birds.\u201d As the dog launched into action, Kim smiled at Linda. \u201cWe don\u2019t let Ari chase the other shorebirds, but gulls are fair game.\u201d</p><p>As the dog ran up the beach, gulls flapped into the air with annoyed squawks, and Linda relaxed. Thank you, Ari, for changing the subject. Even with someone as understanding as Kim, she didn\u2019t want to discuss Sam. She sighed. If he\u2019d simply whipped her at the slave auction, she\u2019d have no problems sharing with Kim, but the damage he\u2019d caused hadn\u2019t been from his whipping her. It hadn\u2019t been physical.</p><p>That night, when Sam had stepped up to her, she\u2019d trusted Kim\u2019s approving nod. He\u2019d told Linda she could have him or another buyer. If she chose him, he would hurt her, and he\u2019d known she was a masochist. He\u2019d driven everything out of her mind except him, the sensations he gave her, and the sound of his growling voice.</p><p>The Overseer had called her a slut and whore. Sam had made her feel like one in an emotional rape far worse than the physical ones.</p><p>Earlier today\u2014although months had passed\u2014her body had still reacted to his voice, craving the safety he offered. The rest of her had wanted to hide in a cave.</p><p>With a happy bark, Ari ran back and shook, sending water and sand over them both. Kim gave a token grumble. \u201cStupid dog.\u201d</p><p>Panting, Ari dropped down over her feet. His wagging tail thumped on Linda\u2019s ankle like a metronome.</p><p>After ruffling the dog\u2019s fur, Kim gave Linda an irrepressible grin. \u201cSo about Master Sam. Do you suppose he got so good at a whip because he\u2019s a rancher, or did the sadist come first?\u201d</p><p>Linda choked. She remembered all too well how competent the man had been. \u201cYou know, a few months ago, you\u2019d never have made a joke about a whip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m better. Not all fixed, but better. Raoul made a huge difference.\u201d She tugged at her shepherd\u2019s ear. \u201cAri helped too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to have a four-footed counselor.\u201d Kim had been kidnapped off the street, and afterward she\u2019d panic if outside alone. Raoul had bought her a doggy escort.</p><p>Kim gave her a worried frown. \u201cI figured you\u2019d come back all tan and happy after being at your sister\u2019s in California, but you look exhausted. Not sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much, no.\u201d Linda managed to smile. \u201cMaybe I should buy a dog. At least I\u2019d have something to keep the bed warm.\u201d But no pet would solve her problems.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe that guy you were dating last fall will want to heat up your sheets.\u201d</p><p>The thought made her skin crawl. \u201cNot going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not surprised. I felt like that too. Did you get counseling in California?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm-hmm. It helped.\u201d At least at first. But now the ice encased her more each day, no matter what she did. Over the past few weeks, she\u2019d tried journaling, talking. Screaming.</p><p>Needing something to do with her hands, she pulled some grasses up, weaving them together in patterns she\u2019d learned as a teen. Basketry had given her an escape from rigid, fanatical parents, given her a world she could control and a way to make beauty. Later, in college, she\u2019d discovered running and how the throbbing of exhausted muscles could break through her stress and help her reconnect with her own feelings.</p><p>She\u2019d needed that help then. Occasionally since.</p><p>Because I\u2019m a masochist. What an ugly label, though, with its implication of perversion. Last fall, when she\u2019d realized she needed something more in her life, she\u2019d wanted to experiment. Why not? She was a widow. Her children grown. No real partner.</p><p>But she should never have taken that first step, never have visited a downtown kink club to learn if her fantasies and needs had any basis in reality. They did; they did. She stared down at her hands, remembering the wonder of that discovery. Even as part of her was horrified that she\u2019d actually asked to be flogged, she\u2019d embraced the pain. Had flown with it, and for a brief period she\u2019d felt...whole. Alive.</p><p>Her throat tightened. Then she\u2019d walked out of the club. Night air, so clean and salty, so quiet after the sounds of the club. In the parking lot, a low cry. Racing over. A woman, unconscious, being tossed into a van. Linda had run, screaming, and everything had gone black.</p><p>She\u2019d been kidnapped herself. Right into slavery, rape, and abuse.</p><p>Now she wanted to feel whole again. To feel alive. She knew one way to accomplish that, but no matter how wonderful that brief experience of pain had been in the BDSM club, how could she let anyone hurt her again? She\u2019d panic...wouldn\u2019t she?</p><p>Yet how could she go home like this? So different from who she really was, with as much emotion in her as a wooden post. Her children would be horrified. And Lee, the man she\u2019d dated off and on? What would he think?</p><p>Every day was growing worse. Recently, she had trouble even laughing. She couldn\u2019t continue like this. With a shuddering breath, she rubbed her hands over her face. She knew what she had to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That night at the slave auction, she\u2019d been more closed off than now, yet Sam had blown her walls wide open, as if his cruel whip had cut fissures to relieve the pressure.</p><p>Maybe if I...if I could get help one more time, then I\u2019d be all right. Back home, with life returned to normal, I\u2019d never need it again.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t allow herself to need it again. When she returned to Foggy Shores, she would need to go back to being normal. To pick up her life and habits and keep everything quiet. Sane.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t home yet.</p><p>If she could just find someone to...hurt her. Just one time. If she could endure it. Her stomach turned over as she thought of returning to the Tampa club, the one where she\u2019d been kidnapped.</p><p>She realized her hands had clenched into tight balls. Finger by finger, she opened them. Earlier, Kim had mentioned that she and Raoul belonged to a BDSM club. A private one.</p><p>No one would know her there. And she wouldn\u2019t be alone. If Kim was there\u2014and Raoul\u2014maybe she\u2019d feel secure enough to...do something.</p><p>Slowly she turned to face Kim. To meet her compassionate eyes. To force out the request. \u201cWould you and Raoul take me to the Shadowlands?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Flanked by Raoul and Kim, Linda walked into the exclusive BDSM club known as the Shadowlands. Light from wrought-iron sconces flickered ominously over the dungeon equipment lining the walls. The overwhelming scents of leather, sweat, and sex slapped into her and stole her breath. The sounds of pain were like a kick to her stomach. Even the music held a savage bite.</p><p>At least no one would see her reactions\u2014or who she was. The black mask she wore concealed her face, leaving only her lips and eyes revealed. Now, if she could only get her feet to move. The little voice inside her screaming get me out of here grew louder.</p><p>When Raoul put his hand on her shoulder, she jumped. \u201cChiquita.\u201d His dark brown eyes were worried. \u201cYou would be safe in the Shadowlands, no matter what. But you\u2019re also with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Considering the man had more muscles than the beach had sand, he was a reassuring presence.</p><p>\u201cLinda, let\u2019s go home,\u201d Kim said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to stay.\u201d Her blue corset matched her eyes, and her black collar held a silver engraving: Master Raoul\u2019s gatita. Of all the women in captivity, Kim had seemed the least likely to want to be a slave. But the love between her and Raoul was so strong it almost shimmered. Somehow, Kim had moved on and found happiness.</p><p>Linda hadn\u2019t. Even worse, she was unraveling as emotions ripped through her. She cringed at the sound of a paddle against flesh. A woman\u2019s screams made her hands turn cold and numb. As the trembling in her belly worked outward, her knees started to shake. She couldn\u2019t escape the memories of horrors. This was the stupidest thing she\u2019d ever done.</p><p>\u201cRaoul.\u201d A gray-eyed man blocked their way, and his gaze swept over her face, her shoulders, her hands. \u201cWhat are you doing? She\u2019s terrified.\u201d</p><p>Well, sheesh. She could have sworn she\u2019d hidden her fear fairly well.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to come,\u201d Kim protested, then closed her mouth when Raoul tugged her collar.</p><p>The stranger was lean and graceful, wearing all black as a Dom would\u2014only he had no need to wear black to establish his authority. Power surrounded him like the scent of aftershave. \u201cYou must be Linda. Little one, you should go home.\u201d</p><p>Raoul squeezed her shoulder. \u201cLinda, this is Master Z. He agreed to give you a temporary membership, and he\u2019s the reason you are safe here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Master Z.\u201d So this was the infamous Master Z who owned the Shadowlands. She swallowed. Kim hadn\u2019t come close to describing how intimidating the man was. \u201cKim\u2019s right. I wanted to come.\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow in an unspoken command to continue. In just one night at that other club, she\u2019d discovered how a Dom in full command mode could turn her spine into jelly.</p><p>\u201cI wanted...\u201d Why had it been easier to explain to Raoul, even if she hadn\u2019t explained everything? \u201cWanted to remind myself that people do this for fun. Consensually.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to replace the images in your head with better ones,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d And maybe find someone to hurt me. God, that sounded so sick.</p><p>He held his hand out, and her fingers were in his grip before she realized she\u2019d moved. He studied her for a minute, then nodded. \u201cAll right, Linda. I think you have the strength, but don\u2019t push yourself into a panic attack.\u201d He arched a brow at Kim. \u201cYour companions are quite familiar with the symptoms.\u201d</p><p>Kim actually giggled. The beautiful sound showed that healing could happen, even after horrors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful,\u201d Linda said.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d He released her hand and moved off with the lethal grace of a big cat.</p><p>Linda blew out a breath and glanced at Kim. \u201cWell. You tried to warn me.\u201d If nothing else, Master Z had broken into her nightmare and got her moving again.</p><p>Kim grinned. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>Linda laughed and looked around. The place was certainly different from the one she\u2019d gone to before. True, her single visit to a BDSM club hardly made her an authority, but she\u2019d spent hours there before doing anything. This place was more expensive. The equipment was padded with leather, the burnished hardwood floors reflected the flickering of the wrought-iron sconces. The general populace was older and quieter, although\u2014she enjoyed the spectacle of a woman in a full catsuit followed by a naked submissive\u2014the costumes were just as outrageous.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to wander around or settle somewhere?\u201d Kim glanced over Linda\u2019s shoulder, and her eyes widened. \u201cUh, let\u2019s just go to the bar.\u201d</p><p>Linda turned. The nearest scene was a man on a St. Andrew\u2019s cross with a Mistress putting clamps on his nipples. The spiderweb next to it held a restrained submissive struggling to evade the flick of a crop. Then a spanking scene. Then several people watching a Dom with a flogger.</p><p>When the Dom turned slightly, Linda\u2019s lungs felt as if they were being pinched in wickedly tight clamps. Sam. Sam was here. She\u2019d forgotten the dangerous vibe he gave off in dominant mode. Almost half a foot taller than her five-seven, he wore black jeans, black boots, a black belt, and a black flannel shirt with the sleeves rolled up. His silvery hair didn\u2019t make him look old\u2014just really, really experienced.</p><p>He was using a full-sized, heavy flogger with brown leather strands. No fancy colors for him. The woman on the cross was in tears, her back reddened. As Sam flogged the blonde with a smooth rhythm, Linda wanted to hate him for inflicting such pain.</p><p>Yet, as the woman went up on tiptoes, she pushed her bottom back to get more. Her face gleamed with sweat and tears, but her half-agonized, half-blissful expression was that of a masochist getting what she wanted.</p><p>I want it too. Linda felt like a shaken soda with the cap screwed on too tightly to let out the increasing pressure. Pain might give her a way to open up and spew everything out. I need that.</p><p>Not with Sam though. No no no. And yet... She shivered and wrapped her arms around herself over her silky shirt. Watching him with a woman made her feel odd. Wanting and angry and unsettled. After a minute, she forced herself to turn away. Thank heavens she\u2019d worn a mask.</p><p>Raoul was watching her, his dark eyes narrowed. \u201cShall I find you a Dom to play with?\u201d</p><p>How had Kim found someone so sweetly protective? But she wouldn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014have another person make those choices for her again. \u201cThank you, but I\u2019d rather choose my own if I decide to...do anything.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d be very careful. She\u2019d pick a sadist, but not one who was also a Dominant. During her night at the club, the Dom she\u2019d spoken to had told her she was submissive as well as a masochist. As if one perversion wasn\u2019t enough, I\u2019ve got two.</p><p>But it had been Sam who had showed her how a powerful Dom could push her limits\u2014could go past her limits. At the auction, she could have handled being whipped, but he\u2019d done...more. Damn him.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish. Then let us have something to drink while you decide.\u201d After pulling Kim to his side, Raoul guided them to the bar.</p><p>Linda glanced longingly at the bottles of tequila, scotch, and rum.</p><p>Raoul shook his head. \u201cYou may have water or a soda.\u201d He turned to Kim and settled her on a bar stool, kissing her hair lightly.</p><p>But I want a drink. Linda sighed but had to admit he was right. Alcohol, in this place, might do as much harm as good. She needed to stay on top of things. In control.</p><p>The bartender\u2019s assistant came over to get their orders. As Kim talked with her, Linda looked over her shoulder at Sam. Again.</p><p>He\u2019d finished the scene. The blonde with spiky hair who might have looked tough at one time was trying to bury herself in his chest. When he rubbed her undoubtedly tender back and she cried harder, he grinned. Definitely a sadist. But a caring one. And strong. She remembered the steel-like feeling of his arms. He might be in his fifties, but he was all bone and muscle.</p><p>A shiver ran up Linda\u2019s spine. Don\u2019t look.</p><p>Turning away, she let herself sink into the sounds of the place. The slap of paddles and floggers and canes. Moaning and groaning. A shriek. Low conversation. A half-heard man\u2019s laugh\u2014the sound familiar and horrible\u2014sent memories oozing through her. Caged on a boat. Men talking about\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook herself loose, feeling cold sweat trickle down her back. I\u2019m free. At the Shadowlands. And as she listened, she realized the noise was different from the slave auctions. The sobbing was that of a release; the shriek had excitement accompanying the pain. There were none of the hopeless cries, the pleading, and the screams of pain that wouldn\u2019t end. She shuddered.</p><p>\u201cLinda. Look at me.\u201d Raoul\u2019s gaze was watchful. Measuring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d And she wasn\u2019t lying. His voice, his steady eyes had settled her. She gave him a shaky smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d Her deep breath calmed her further as she carefully cataloged more differences. She\u2019d thought the downtown BDSM club smelled of leather, sex, pain, and fear. Now she knew fear stank of piss and blood and sour sweat. Nothing like here.</p><p>The Shadowlands held laughter, and not only from the male Doms. There were women laughing. To one side, some submissives giggled as one negotiated with a Dom. Linda took a quick survey of the room before turning to Kim. \u201cThe percentage of Doms to submissives seems pretty even.\u201d</p> <p>The bartender\u2019s submissive grinned at her. \u201cGood eye. I\u2019m Andrea, by the way.\u201d She glanced around the room and answered Linda\u2019s unspoken questions. \u201cMaster Z keeps the membership balanced, no matter how long the waiting list gets. It\u2019s nice. I\u2019ve visited clubs where I felt like a sheep surrounded by a pack of wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Linda agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense of being stalked.\u201d In fact, the unattached subs were having a good time with each other. More weight lifted from her shoulders. She\u2019d be safe here, if... Could she really do this? Let a sadist hurt her? Her fears and needs seemed to twine together, creating a macram\u00e9 of self-loathing. Why couldn\u2019t she be normal?</p><p>Her gaze fell on a man by a St. Andrew\u2019s cross. Tall. Thin. He was packing up his toy bag after using a cane on a younger woman who\u2019d quickly wimped out. But he hadn\u2019t tried to dominate the woman. As he picked up his bag, he met Linda\u2019s gaze and nodded politely.</p><p>She continued to stare at him, and he tilted his head, reassessing her.</p><p>Raoul\u2019s hand covered hers. \u201cAre you sure, chiquita? Edward is a sadist but not a Dominant. Sam might be\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot Sam.\u201d When his eyebrows rose, she winced at her bluntness. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not apologize for being honest.\u201d His gaze stayed on her face. \u201cContinue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...I don\u2019t want a Dom. Or Sam.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cDid Sam do something that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, it\u2019s nothing. I just like making my own choices.\u201d To escape more questions, she kissed his cheek in a hasty apology, then went to meet the sadist halfway.</p><p>AS SAM CLEANED the equipment and kept an eye on Dara, he half listened to the sounds from the adjacent scene. Holt was using a cane on a submissive, pushing her boundaries and heightening her arousal. From the noise the brunette was making, the Dom was doing an excellent job.</p> <p>After putting the cleaning supplies in the stand, Sam went down on one knee beside Dara. With a blanket around her shoulders, the Goth trainee had eaten her chocolate bites and was sipping the sports drink he\u2019d given her.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing?\u201d Sam asked, running his knuckles over her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d Her eyes were clear, skin warm, speech coherent. He\u2019d learned Dara didn\u2019t want much aftercare, didn\u2019t want to be held. She liked moving around and enjoying the buzz. She grinned at him. \u201cThat was really fun, Master Sam. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then.\u201d He stood and helped her to her feet. After giving him a quick hug, she trotted off toward the restrooms\u2014undoubtedly to admire the stripes he\u2019d put on her thighs and ass.</p><p>Feeling a tad deprived, he headed to the bar. What was the world coming to when a Dom enjoyed aftercare more than the submissive?</p><p>\u201cHey, Davies.\u201d</p><p>Sam looked around.</p><p>Special Agent Vance Buchanan and his partner, Galen Kouros, were sitting at the bar.</p> <p>Sam leaned an elbow on the bar and greeted the linebacker-sized agent, \u201cBuchanan,\u201d then nodded at the lean, dark one. \u201cKouros.\u201d They were both in jeans and white button-up shirts. \u201cHere on Fed business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d Kouros said. \u201cOur transfer to Tampa came through, so we\u2019re talking to Z about membership here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be welcome.\u201d Sam had seen them play a time or two. Although it wasn\u2019t common for two Doms to link up permanently, they\u2019d made topping together into an art. And Kouros had some serious skill with mind-fucking games. \u201cIs the Harvest Association belly-up?\u201d Although the Feds had netted the bastards who\u2019d kidnapped Linda and Kim, the slave-trafficking association\u2019s reach extended across the entire United States.</p><p>\u201cNot quite. The northeast is still going strong.\u201d Buchanan scowled. \u201cWe think that area has some highly placed contacts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bad crime.\u201d Over the past months, the lines in Kouros\u2019s face had deepened.</p><p>The Harvest Association dealt in human trafficking with a twist. They kidnapped intelligent middle- and upper-class submissives, ones already in the lifestyle, and sold them to wealthy buyers who wanted trained slaves or\u2014even worse\u2014toys to be broken. Linda and Kim had been slaves. Other Shadowlands submissives had been targeted. Like Z\u2019s Jessica and a mouthy trainee named Sally.</p><p>Sally was cute as a button. He spotted her, hands on hips, apparently giving a newer Dom a lesson in something. Sam chuckled. Although he preferred to scene with masochists, he\u2019d topped the little brunette a few times. She took a bit of work, but then she would surrender beautifully.</p><p>All of the Shadowlands Masters worked with the trainees, filling their needs, instructing and evaluating. The goal was to get them matched with suitable Doms, but Sally was too damn smart and independent for her own good. She needed a powerful Dom, and so far Z hadn\u2019t found one who would meet her needs.</p><p>Buchanan\u2019s gaze followed Sam\u2019s, and the FBI agent nudged his partner, pointing out the trainee. The girl loved role-play games and today had dressed as a biker chick...probably hoping for someone to take on the cop role. \u201cWant to give her a treat?\u201d Buchanan asked.</p><p>Kouros smiled slowly before shaking his head. \u201cMembers have more privileges than guests,\u201d he reminded Buchanan. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo.\u201d Wearing his brown \u201cI\u2019m a Dom and don\u2019t need black to prove it\u201d leathers, Cullen looked up from drawing a beer for someone. \u201cYou agents plotting something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d Buchanan said.</p><p>After giving the Feds\u2019 glasses a bartender\u2019s assessment, Cullen grinned at Sam. \u201c\u2019Bout time you graced us with your presence, buddy. What can I get you?\u201d</p><p>Sam considered. Did he want something? Was he finished for the night? His arm was tired; his need to make a woman cry was satisfied. He didn\u2019t want to do a more intense scene\u2014hadn\u2019t wanted to in months. Damn the redhead. \u201cHow about a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about not?\u201d Cullen leaned a big arm on the bar top. \u201cRaoul\u2019s here with Kim and a friend of hers. An older redhead. Would she be the Linda I\u2019ve heard rumors about?\u201d</p><p>His Linda? Sam straightened. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing a scene with Edward.\u201d Cullen jerked his chin toward the right.</p><p>Sam spotted her easily. Dark red hair. White skin. Despite her mask, she was easily recognizable\u2014at least to a Dom who\u2019d run his hands all over her beautifully curved body. What the hell was she doing? A hard-core sadist, Edward had a good technique with a single-tail, but... \u201cHe\u2019s no Dom, and she\u2019s submissive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? She told Raoul she didn\u2019t want a Dom\u2014or you.\u201d</p><p>The words sliced through his flesh like a fillet knife. \u201cThen why the hell did you point her out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll her fire at just hearing your name? You got unresolved business there, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Not any revelation, at least on Sam\u2019s side. But she wasn\u2019t going to let him close enough to do anything about it.</p><p>Cullen was laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so goddamned funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck out the scene.\u201d Cullen nodded to the cross. \u201cThat\u2019s one frustrated subbie.\u201d</p><p>Sam looked again. Linda\u2019s back was to the room as Edward used a cane on her jeans-covered ass. Gorgeous body. Maybe not to the fools who wanted their women young and tight and bland. No, Linda\u2019s body was past prime. Soft. The highlighted streaks in her hair were probably there to cover up the gray. He remembered she had fine wrinkles beside her mouth, on her neck. And he wanted her with every cell in his body.</p><p>With a grunt of annoyance, he shut his dick down and studied her. Cullen\u2019s comment held truth. She was flinching from the blows. Not welcoming them. In the way a woman might be unable to have an orgasm, the sweet masochist wasn\u2019t hitting the place that would let her ride the pain. Why? Sam watched awhile longer, and his jaw tightened. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t trust him enough to go with it. And he\u2019s not dominant enough to break through to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my take.\u201d</p><p>Sam saw Z approaching the scene. The owner of the Shadowlands rarely interrupted a session...unless he felt the play was harmful to the submissive. And that scene certainly wasn\u2019t doing Linda any favors. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam pushed away from the bar and strode over to intercept him.</p><p>Z gave him a level look. \u201cSamuel.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to hear Z state what he already knew. \u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t want to see me. But I\u2019m the one she needs right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a history between you. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s not a happy one.\u201d</p> <p>Submissives loved to gossip, and Z\u2019s Jessica would be at the heart of it. \u201cI screwed up, but there was a connection between us. It\u2019s still there.\u201d</p><p>Z\u2019s frown deepened, and he crossed his arms over his chest as he considered. \u201cYou may offer. If she accepts, you will emphasize she has a safe word. And I intend to monitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering what she\u2019s been through, I\u2019m good with a backup.\u201d Sam turned. Butting into another Dom\u2019s scene wasn\u2019t done, but...she needed him. His protective instincts pushed him closer.</p><p>Edward wasn\u2019t into the scene at all, or he wouldn\u2019t have noticed Sam stand one foot too close to the roped-off area. He walked over. \u201cFriend of yours?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d give his left nut to be able to say yes. \u201cNot quite. But I might be able to get through to her. She\u2019s submissive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo fucking way. She said she wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be shitting me.\u201d Edward scowled. \u201cI should have spotted it. But she was so insistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth isn\u2019t always comfortable. May I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for it. I\u2019m fucking tired of being lied to.\u201d Edward tossed his cane in his bag, picked it up, and stalked away.</p><p>Well, that was easy. Sam moved slowly as if approaching a wild mare. They had a connection from before, and she needed what he had to give. Was it enough to get past her anger? To let her trust him? His shoulder muscles knotted as he approached from the side where she could see him. If she\u2019d open her eyes.</p> <p>He took a minute to enjoy the sight of her. She still wore her jeans and an ugly black mask but had removed her shirt and bra, leaving her lightly freckled back bare. In the courthouse, she\u2019d been dead white, but now he saw she had a fading tan. Kim had mentioned she\u2019d been in California to recuperate and escape the asshole newspeople. Welcome home, girl. His mouth tightened when he saw the faint white lines\u2014scars\u2014on her back, left from her trauma.</p><p>He gripped her chin gently but firmly enough that she\u2019d recognize the touch of a Master. \u201cLinda. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes popped open, and her body went rigid. \u201cNo. Not you.\u201d</p><p>Dammit, he\u2019d had submissives fearful of him, especially nonmasochists, but at the auction, he\u2019d given Linda only as much pain as she\u2019d needed. Anger might be warranted, not fear. \u201cGoddammit, I\u2019ve never hurt anyone who didn\u2019t ask me to.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as if she couldn\u2019t stand the sight of him, but restrained on the cross, she had no choice except to hear his apology.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I did.\u201d Where were all the arguments he\u2019d come up with over the past months? \u201cBut I did something wrong. I\u2019m sorry, girl.\u201d</p><p>Her body shuddered as if trying to throw off his words. Her eyes opened. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>The anger and shame in her gaze was far more honest than her words. Her forgiveness wasn\u2019t even close. \u201cYes, it does. I hope you\u2019ll forgive me. But for right now\u201d\u2014with her chin cupped in his palm, he stroked his thumb over her jawline below the mask\u2014\u201cyou need to hurt. And you need someone to push you hard enough that you can relax into it.\u201d</p> <p>She bit back an obvious denial, and her eyebrows drew together.</p><p>He held himself immobile, not touching the bright strands dancing on her shoulders, not tracing the ridge of her spine with his fingers. He permitted only one touch; she needed the dominance of his hand controlling her face. Nothing more. Not yet. \u201cTell me I\u2019m wrong, girl.\u201d</p><p>Tiny puffs of air hit his palm as her breathing went shallow and fast. And then...she shook her head.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t wrong. The surge of satisfaction held him frozen for another moment. \u201cAll right then. Here\u2019s how it will be. Your safe word is red. Say it.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and then whispered, \u201cRed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d This time he ran his thumb over her puffy lips, seeing her pupils dilate until her eyes were as dark as the cross on which she was bound. \u201cI\u2019m going to touch you, but your jeans will stay up. Your pussy will be out of bounds.\u201d This time. \u201cI\u2019ll leave your mask on.\u201d Although it annoyed the hell out of him. \u201cI won\u2019t try to get you off. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my...breasts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are mine to play with.\u201d He leaned in closer until all she\u2019d be able to see was his face. \u201cTo hurt.\u201d</p><p>A flush swept upward from her chest to her face. She was aroused.</p><p>The knowledge gave him a finer satisfaction than coming after a long fucking. The connection they\u2019d had before was intact. Working with her this time would be like sliding a new hickory handle into the eye of an ax head. Knowing it was a perfect fit. Then hammering in the wedge to prevent their bond from coming apart again. That\u2019s what she\u2019d lacked with Edward. She needed dominance as much as she needed pain.</p><p>He\u2019d give her both before he was done.</p><p>\u201cYour mouth is mine as well,\u201d he growled before taking her lips. Soft, plump lips, and he wouldn\u2019t enjoy them in anything but a kiss. Even if tonight was all she\u2019d give him, he wouldn\u2019t betray her trust.</p><p>After a moment, her lips moved under his. He took but stepped away before she was satisfied. Next time he kissed her, she\u2019d offer him more and sooner. He needed to keep her off balance and slowly gather in each tiny piece of her until he had it all. And then, reins in hand, he\u2019d use the spurs.</p><p>MIND SPINNING AS a disconcerting arousal swelled within her, Linda tried to look at Sam, but he\u2019d moved behind her. As he gathered her hair, which brushed her shoulders, his grip was firm, pulling hard enough that she felt each hair follicle waken and protest. God, what had she agreed to?</p><p>She\u2019d agreed to more. When Edward had caned her, the hurt had done nothing for her. She couldn\u2019t understand why. Yet somehow Sam knew what was wrong. His gaze reached right to where her soul hid from the outside world.</p><p>Just his voice and the way he\u2019d gripped her face had dissolved the floor beneath her, leaving her sinking in quicksand. \u201cSam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s my name.\u201d His deep voice sounded at one with the bass of the techno music. He pushed her hair forward so the strands tickled her collarbone with each breath. When Edward had done the same, she\u2019d felt nothing. Now her skin was in a shivery, anticipating state, feeling the coolness of the air, the brush of his arm.</p><p>As he ran his calloused fingers down her spine, the abrasive sensation started to melt the ice inside her. When his touch moved over her jeans to where the cane had left sore areas, heat pooled low in her belly. How did he do this to her? She shook her head and craned her neck, trying to see over her shoulder.</p><p>He\u2019d obviously been waiting for her to do just that, and the shock of his intent gaze was like a blow to her chest. \u201cThose big eyes won\u2019t help you, missy. You\u2019re where I want you. We both know you\u2019ll be crying before I\u2019m through.\u201d</p><p>His harsh words compressed her ribs until she had to struggle for her next breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a look at you first though.\u201d As his hands slid over her wide hips, delight lit his gaze like sunlight through a stained glass window. \u201cYou got a beautiful body, missy.\u201d</p><p>The compliment shoved her off balance, as if she\u2019d missed a step.</p><p>His grip on her hips tightened, holding her immobile, and the strength in his fingers was terrifying. Arousing. He could hold her...down. She\u2019d been afraid to think about that when coming in here, and now she wanted it? Not logical. She shook her head, wanting\u2014</p><p>The whapping sound was simultaneous with the shocking sting on her bottom. He\u2019d swatted her hard. \u201cYou don\u2019t think unless I tell you to think,\u201d he growled before slapping her other ass cheek.</p><p>The burn spread out from her bottom. Her brain blanked as if he\u2019d shut off a switch.</p><p>Before she could reorder her thoughts, she heard him say, \u201cGood girl.\u201d Leaning against her from behind, he rubbed his chest over the strips of hot flesh on her back, sending fitful sparks of pain through her like a malfunctioning lighter. The ground dropped another foot.</p><p>He reached around to cup her breasts in his big hands, and the caress shook areas deep inside her, places that had dried up and died. \u201cSam.\u201d It sounded like a protest, but she heard the plea beneath.</p><p>His teeth closed on her shoulder, biting the muscle, holding her as he moved his hands in a milking pattern, increasing the blood flow to her nipples. When his fingers closed on the engorged peaks, the exquisite sensation buckled her knees. He gave a rough laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed about your breasts.\u201d His voice was low, his breath warm on her ear. He pinched harder, continuing the pressure until every molecule inside her liquefied. She moaned, losing herself as the burn wrapped around her nerves.</p><p>He growled in enjoyment, then moved away, leaving her breasts throbbing. After taking a flogger from his bag\u2014a heavier one than what he\u2019d used on the other woman\u2014he tickled it over her back. The scent of leather swept through her, the smell reminding her of the other BDSM club. Where the pain had been good. Her eyes closed as she took a bigger breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he gave her a couple of experimental flicks over her shoulders and ass, the light thudding was wonderful.</p><p>\u201cEdward warmed you up well. Let\u2019s get some red going on those shoulders.\u201d</p><p>Her husband\u2019d had that matter-of-fact tone. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s going to rain.\u201d But Frederick would never have talked about hurting her. \u201cThat\u2019s not something nice people do, Linda.\u201d She wasn\u2019t a nice person. She was perverted and\u2014</p><p>The nasty swat on her bottom made her gasp and fragmented her thoughts. \u201cDon\u2019t listen well, do you, little girl?\u201d Sam said. He drew his hand back, and three more hard slaps followed.</p><p>Tears burned Linda\u2019s eyes, and as the stinging warped into intense pleasure, the feeling that swept through her was glorious. Her nerves drank in the hurting like flowers in a drought, and her body started to shake. This wasn\u2019t right. She couldn\u2019t take this. She\u2019d break. But Sam...Sam would keep her safe as she fell apart.</p><p>A hard hand caught her chin and examined her face. \u201cThere we go. You\u2019re ready to cry now.\u201d</p><p>He ran his hand down her back, and she had a moment of panic when nothing touched her, and then the flogger whapped against her bottom. Where the strands hit the places he\u2019d spanked, her skin seemed to inhale the impact, breathing in the sensation like air.</p><p>Left-right, left-right. The flogger moved in an easy rhythm up her butt, skipping over the area below her ribs to avoid the kidneys, then her upper back\u2014harder, increasing slowly from thumping to something heavier. Each strike hurt enough that she\u2019d tense before feeling the bite. Each sear of pain expanded deeper inward and settled low in her belly. Then her muscles would tighten again in anticipation. A few fast blows removed her ability to tense between them.</p><p>The sound of the flogger on flesh turned harsher when it hit her jeans. The dance-floor music had changed, the bass turned up to reverberate against her bones. The strands moved down to her ass, upping the deep burn as if the sadist took glee in seeing her hips move. Whap; pain; pleasure. Whap; pain; pleasure. She started to settle into the rhythm. Her head felt light, her body heavy.</p><p>\u201cYou have the prettiest round ass. Let\u2019s see it dance, girl.\u201d</p><p>The strikes came harder as he drove her out of her comfort zone, harder until her hips were trying to evade yet tilting up for more of the sharp-edged sweetness. Tears rolled down her cheeks as a massive glacier of agony dug deep, pushing everything before it as it carved out its passageway. A wail of distress escaped her.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNice. Give me more.\u201d</p><p>The strands moved lower, sending fire across the backs and sides of her thighs. Wonderful hurting. She heard low crying, and it was hers. Then she was choking on sobs as everything inside her bubbled up and out. He didn\u2019t stop, keeping up a steady rhythm she could depend on as the rest of her dissolved.</p><p>Sometime later, she realized the flogger was only caressing her lightly with a whisper of sweet pain, enough to keep her connected. She lifted her head, amazed at how difficult it was. Tears still streamed from her eyes as she sank into the sensation, the heat. She could feel her body, every inch of her skin aware and sensitive in a way she hadn\u2019t felt in a long, long time. Slowly she gathered her senses, sliding back into reality.</p><p>So, so wonderfully relaxed.</p><p>The flogger dropped onto the floor with a thump, and Sam leaned against her again. His body warmth and the abrasion of his shirt set her back to a happy burn even as he pulled her tighter. His erection pressed against her backside, but he didn\u2019t rub it on her or even seem to notice as he teased her nipples into hard points. One hand opened, flattened on her waist, just above her jeans. \u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful armful,\u201d he growled in her ear.</p><p>Her body shook, urgent with arousal. Her clit throbbed, needing his hand to move lower. Her body remembered exactly how his experienced fingers had felt when he brought her to orgasm.</p><p>In front of a room of slavers.</p><p>No. When she stiffened, his hand stilled. She wanted more. No, I don\u2019t. No. Not ever again. What was she even doing here? This was sick. Unnatural. \u201cLet me go, Sam,\u201d she whispered, wanting, wanting.</p><p>He fisted her hair and tilted her face to study her. The firmness of his grip said he knew she was fleeing from herself. The liquid warmth inside her said he could stop her. Please her. His ice-blue gaze swept over her. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>She realized the horrible feeling inside had disappeared. The pressure and the shadows were gone from her spirit, washed away with her tears and pain.</p><p>What kind of a perv was she that she needed to hurt to be able to empty her emotions?</p><p>His hand tightened on her jaw. \u201cDon\u2019t think. Not now. Tomorrow is soon enough.\u201d He reached up and unsnapped her cuffs, then helped her away from the cross. Her back burned where his arm around her waist rubbed the tender skin. Her legs shook as if she had been sick for a year, and she sagged against him.</p> <p>He walked her to the edge of the scene area. \u201cKneel here.\u201d</p><p>Her whole body went stiff as nausea surged. The Overseer had made her kneel for everything. Always. Or crawl. Would he\u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not your slave,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>He gave her a look, and his tone was firm but mild. \u201cI don\u2019t need or want a slave.\u201d</p><p>Slave. Just the sound made her sicker until his words registered. \u201cDon\u2019t need or want a slave.\u201d Her spine found strength, and her shoulders straightened. \u201cThen why make me kneel?\u201d Her mouth was so dry that her voice came out in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stand by yourself, baby. You need to be close to the floor.\u201d His rough voice held an odd tenderness. \u201cAnd I want you where I can keep an eye on you as I clean up.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She let him help her down, her right knee, as always, stiffer than the other. To her surprise, when he returned with a bottled water and blanket, he squatted down to wrap the fuzzy fabric around her. Warm. Wonderfully concealing. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d His hand stayed on her shoulder, holding her firmly.</p><p>She frowned and looked up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kneeling for one more reason, girl, and you might as well learn to deal. You\u2019re submissive. That\u2019s part of what you need...and kneeling is an acknowledgment of that. Submission isn\u2019t slavery.\u201d</p><p>Her chin tightened. Yes, it is.</p><p>He breathed out, then opened the water and wrapped her fingers around the bottle. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>As he cleaned the equipment, she watched. Not young at all, older than her. But he moved with a rancher\u2019s strength and a strong man\u2019s confidence.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have that kind of confidence. Not anymore. Hard to believe she\u2019d run her household and a business. Now she was in a BDSM club. Asking to be beaten. She really was the pervert that a lover had called her. Or the dirty slut that the slavers had named her.</p><p>Her hands started to shake. She\u2019d done what she\u2019d set out to do. Broken through all the walls. Could feel again. But now she needed to leave. This wasn\u2019t what she wanted in her life. With an effort, she looked around for Kim and Raoul.</p><p>They stood just beyond the rope beside Master Z. They\u2019d all been watching.</p><p>A flush warmed Linda\u2019s face. Kim might be submissive, but she wasn\u2019t a...masochist. A pain slut. Humiliation swept through her as she set down the water and struggled to her feet. \u201cRaoul, please. Can we go home now?\u201d</p><p>A moment of confusion showed on Raoul\u2019s face, and then he nodded. \u201cIf you want.\u201d He gripped her arm, steadying her, as Kim went to get her shirt and bra.</p><p>Sam saw them and returned. \u201cRaoul.\u201d The anger in Sam\u2019s voice was suppressed but present.</p><p>The way Raoul tensed showed that even a weight lifter didn\u2019t want to take on an angry Sam.</p><p>Guilt made her shoulders hunch. She was causing a problem between friends. \u201cIt\u2019s not his fault, Sam. I asked them to take me home.\u201d</p><p>When he reached for her, she flinched back. His arm lowered. \u201cYou\u2019re not ready to leave. You can barely walk...and we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...sorry.\u201d She pulled on her bra, feeling the sweet tenderness of her back. Wanting more. \u201cWhat you did helped,\u201d she admitted. He\u2019d earned her thanks. In a way, an ugly way, she\u2019d used him. Except...he liked what he\u2019d done, hadn\u2019t he? Had he received as much pleasure from seeing her pain as she had from receiving it? \u201cBut I-I don\u2019t do this...stuff. I was just here to learn to put it behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it behind you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. This isn\u2019t who I am.\u201d She forced her chin up, her spine straight, even though she\u2019d felt so, so much better on her knees. \u201cThank you for\u201d\u2014 for hurting me. For making me cry, making me feel\u2014\u201cfor your time.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his chin in acknowledgment. But was that hurt she saw in his face for a moment? Surely not from this harsh man who\u2019d called her \u201cbaby\u201d and wrapped a blanket around her. Her eyes burned. Why had she ever wanted to feel? Her heart hurt, throbbing as if it had taken the beating instead of her back.</p><p>He shot Raoul an unreadable look. \u201cTake care of her.\u201d</p><p>Raoul\u2019s fighting stance relaxed. \u201cAs if she were my own.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m no one\u2019s. The knowledge didn\u2019t sound independent\u2014just lonely. Linda pulled on her shirt and led the way to the exit to show Sam she didn\u2019t need help. As his gaze burned into her back, she forced herself not to look over her shoulder, not to run and kneel at his feet. Why couldn\u2019t she just have been a...normal person and him a normal person? Then, maybe... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>NEAR THE far wall of the Shadowlands, the spotter watched Adrienne wipe down the sawhorse. Tears still ran down her face. Quite nice. Even nicer were the welts on her ass and thighs. Red marks over her hips showed where his fingers had dug in as he fucked her. Used and abused, just the way he liked them.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been a bad fuck, considering her youth. And getting off put him in an excellent mood, despite settling for a woman so thin her breasts were almost nonexistent. But the plumper women had already been picked. Perhaps he should speak to Z about getting a wider variety of submissives.</p><p>Or perhaps not.</p><p>He preferred to avoid the owner of the club, since the psychologist displayed a disconcerting competence at reading people. In fact, it was good that Aaron had joined soon after the Shadowlands opened. Over the years, the club\u2019s application and interview process had grown more rigorous than he\u2019d be willing to risk.</p> <p>After all, a man who selected submissives to be sold into slavery must exert a modicum of caution.</p><p>Adrienne put away the cleaning supplies in the stand and then knelt at his feet.</p><p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d he said.</p><p>Biting her trembling lower lip, she gazed up at him. Probably hoping he\u2019d hold her and pet her. Did he look like a pathetically weak-willed Dom?</p><p>\u201cI told you before we started, I don\u2019t do aftercare. Take yourself off.\u201d Since he\u2019d been clear about his inclinations, she could hardly bitch about the lack. Z couldn\u2019t fault him if the sub knew the deal.</p> <p>Without speaking, she scooped up her clothing and scurried away, probably to cry over her injured feelings. Or the welts. Given his choice, she\u2019d be bleeding rather than welted, but she\u2019d been about to use her safe word, so he\u2019d throttled back. Because the Shadowlands had rules.</p><p>He smiled, remembering the last whore he\u2019d bought. Paying for his fun annoyed him, but at least he wasn\u2019t forced to stop. Not with fucking the slut, not with hurting her.</p><p>As he cleaned his toys, he glanced around the room and spotted the ex-slave leaving with Raoul. Yeah, maybe his next prostitute should be a redhead. Soft. Older.</p><p>Interesting that she was here. And wearing a mask, no less. He laughed. Did she believe hiding her face would conceal her identity? Hardly. Her hair and breasts were quite memorable. He ran his fingers over the cane he held. Smooth. Flexible. Would mark that pale skin nicely.</p><p>Now where had he seen her? He rubbed his finger over his upper lip. On the slave boat. Seems as if she\u2019d been kidnapped a couple of weeks before, and the association had permitted select buyers to preview the merchandise. The redhead had been in one of the kennels, her head turned and eyes closed to shut out the leering buyers.</p><p>Strong woman. He\u2019d liked that.</p> <p>No one had bought her at the first auction\u2014most buyers preferred the young ones\u2014so he\u2019d bided his time, waiting for her to be devalued and then used as a reward for spotters and guards. But the Overseer had insisted on putting her up for sale again, and Feds had raided the auction.</p><p>Stinking Feds. His source of cheap, disposable slaves had disappeared that night. With a grunt of annoyance, he tossed the thin cane into his bag.</p><p>As he strolled to the bar, he considered asking Cullen for the ex-slave\u2019s name. No, showing interest in her would be unwise, at least until the Harvest Association ceased to be newsworthy.</p><p>He\u2019d have to settle for whores. For now.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Tears prickled in Linda\u2019s eyes as she drove down the cul-de-sac and pulled into her driveway. Home at last. And mercifully alone. She\u2019d have no witnesses if she burst into tears.</p><p>At first she\u2019d thought she\u2019d have to spend a mint for a taxi to get to Foggy Shores, but Raoul had arranged for someone to bring her car to his house. Obstinate, overprotective Dom. Bless him.</p><p>Linda slid out of the car and regarded the pretty one-story house where she and Frederick had raised their children. Deep inside, she\u2019d harbored fear that it might have been destroyed\u2014like her life had been. Inhaling slowly, she wrapped the peace of the tiny coastal town and her quiet neighborhood around her like a blanket. So familiar. Next door, dolls and cars scattered the sidewalk like a toy explosion. Across the street, the Smiths\u2019 impeccably trimmed yard made the Brendans\u2019 appear even more straggly. Music trickled from Adele\u2019s home where she gave piano lessons.</p> <p>Not everything stayed the same though. A FOR SALE sign was planted in Myrtle\u2019s front yard. Brenna had mentioned the old woman\u2019s death.</p><p>Twenty years ago, the starchy woman had been the first to welcome Linda and Frederick to the street. I didn\u2019t get to say good-bye.</p><p>Linda blinked back tears. She\u2019d been in captivity two months and spent another three in California. Almost half a year. She\u2019d changed\u2014oh, she had\u2014but she\u2019d counted on Foggy Shores to stay the same.</p><p>But no matter. She was home now, ready to pick up her life. To be the respectable mother of Brenna and Charles, the owner of Foggy Treasures, a good neighbor, a member of the Methodist choir. A normal woman who dated nice normal men.</p><p>Not a pervert.</p><p>Pulling her suitcase, she entered her house. Here, everything was the same. Brenna and Charles had checked on the place every week.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d She pulled in a shuddering breath as her voice echoed in the silence. She should be grateful her sweet terrier had died a while before her kidnapping, but now there was no excited yapping to welcome her home. No one at all. Maybe she should have let the kids come today, but unsure of the trial\u2019s length, she\u2019d told them to hold off. They both had college classes, after all.</p><p>They\u2019d visit next weekend. No reason to feel so...let down. Ignoring the hollowness in her chest, she went to the bedroom to unpack. Time to get back to routines. She\u2019d wallowed in her emotions long enough.</p><p>Sunlight filtered through the sand-colored draperies in her bedroom, danced over the cream-and-white, lacy bedspread. Peaceful, lighthearted colors.</p><p>So different from the Shadowlands last night. She bit her lip, trying not to remember Sam\u2019s voice. His hands. The pain he\u2019d given her in such a mixture of caring and roughness she\u2019d had no choice but to submit. She closed her eyes, hating herself for wanting more. For wanting a sadist. For not being normal.</p><p>The phone\u2019s ring made her jump. She glanced at the display. Unknown number. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>A shrill man\u2019s voice said, \u201cThis is Italy\u2019s Pizza, calling to confirm your order.\u201d</p><p>Linda laughed at the familiar game. \u201cThat\u2019s a good one, Charles. Yes, I\u2019m home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Mom. How come I can fool everyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour friends aren\u2019t singers, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess not. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re back, Mom. I missed you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Since being freed, she\u2019d talked to him every few days, and he and Brenna had joined her in California for Thanksgiving and Christmas. \u201cI missed you too.\u201d More than I can say.</p><p>\u201cAre you going back to work now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to spend today setting things in order and restocking the refrigerator, and then go in on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh good. I was hoping your vacation would be over.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tightened around the phone. Vacation? Depression so black that she\u2019d stared at the ceiling, unable to find a reason to get out of bed. Erratic crying fits, throwing up, panic attacks. She was hardly having fun. Charles knew she\u2019d gone to her sister\u2019s to recover from the kidnapping. Well, he was only twenty, and she\u2019d tried very hard to hide her shattered mental state from the children. He wouldn\u2019t know she\u2019d needed all that time to pull the pieces of herself back together. \u201cNot much choice, I\u2019m afraid. My funds are pretty exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you don\u2019t have any money to spare?\u201d A long sigh came over the phone. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. Exhaustion was setting in, and she sagged against the dresser. \u201cWatch the language, my boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. But...I\u2019m broke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI transferred money into your account on the first. That was supposed to last you all month.\u201d</p><p>Silence. \u201cWell, it didn\u2019t. Things cost more now. I need some money, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo eat, dammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour job at the cafeteria pays for your meals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI quit, all right? It was taking too much time and\u2014\u201d He broke off.</p><p>And his friends didn\u2019t have to work. She frowned. Frederick\u2019s life insurance paid for the children\u2019s tuition and books, and she took care of their rent and gave them a small allowance. He wasn\u2019t being abused, despite his whining. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Charles. You\u2019d better get the job back. I don\u2019t have the money to spare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... Fine.\u201d The silence grew. Then he muttered, \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>She blinked back tears, unable to speak, and after a second heard the brat turn back into the sweetheart she\u2019d raised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom. And I really am glad you\u2019re back. See you next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d she whispered to the dial tone. She listened to the hum for a while, too tired to set the receiver down. Too afraid of starting to cry. Normally she\u2019d have taken his behavior in stride. It was just...now...that everything seemed to abrade her feelings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Saying no was the right thing to do. Even if she\u2019d been rich, she\u2019d make him work for part of his college expenses. People didn\u2019t value anything unless they themselves put some effort into getting it. Which meant if she handed him all the money, he\u2019d actually be more liable to flunk out.</p><p>Logic didn\u2019t help. She\u2019d disappointed her baby. Welcome home, Linda.</p><p>At the end of that week, Linda stood behind the counter in her beachfront store, ringing up the sale of a canvas, hand-stitched beach tote. Her feet were screaming at being forced back into her favorite high-heeled sandals, her legs ached from standing so much, and her shoulders were knotted from evenings spent on the accounting backlog. Yet it was wonderful to be home. Her life was returning to normal.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lovely store.\u201d The customer signed the charge slip.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Linda beamed as she handed over the receipt. \u201cHave a wonderful day on the beach.\u201d</p><p>After growing up in a tiny Florida town, she\u2019d thought she\u2019d simply be a teacher. Or maybe a preacher\u2019s wife like her mother had been. Who knew that she\u2019d love running her own business, love the interactions with customers? And after the slavers had tried to convince her she was nothing more than a slut, she needed the reassurance that she was good at what she did.</p><p>The store door was latched open, letting customers on the boardwalk flow in and out. Inside, a young couple, hand in hand, were checking out the etched coffee cups. A trio of older women studied the wall of Florida shore paintings. On the right, her clerk was restocking the glass case holding the handcrafted jewelry.</p><p>Linda inhaled, enjoying how the sand candles\u2019 scents mingled with the salty air off the Gulf. Her tiny store specialized in handcrafted items for tourists. It held no shot glasses or T-shirts made overseas by the thousands. Instead, everything was created by Florida artisans. She even commissioned some of the more popular items. To her delight, the baskets she made also sold well.</p><p>She\u2019d never make a fortune but had enough to pay bills and help the children with their expenses\u2014although not working for five months had come close to being a disaster. Thank goodness that after Frederick\u2019s death, she\u2019d set up her affairs so the children and business would be handled in case of her death or disability.</p> <p>But even though the accounting firm had handled the bills and payroll, everything else was behind. In fact, she\u2019d only managed to join Lee for lunch once. Seeing the guy she\u2019d dated off and on before her kidnapping had been...awkward. But Lee was a nice man. He hadn\u2019t pushed her and had turned their conversation to local affairs, letting her fill in as she wanted. Although he\u2019d asked her out, she\u2019d put him off for another week. She really did have too much to do.</p><p>In fact... She frowned at the window display, which needed to be redone as well.</p><p>By the open door, two townspeople slowed to look inside. As their voices dropped to whispers, Linda stiffened.</p><p>Her four part-time clerks had been overjoyed to have her back. She\u2019d needed that reassurance since her kidnapping and return had created ripples through the town. The beachfront shop owners and clerks formed a small community of their own, and her acceptance there and elsewhere had changed. She heard ugly whispers everywhere, even with customers in her own store, and the sound was wearing her down.</p><p>She\u2019d started to feel like the prostitute in Pretty Woman\u2014the one who had discovered that a respectable appearance didn\u2019t mean she could ever belong.</p><p>\u201cAll done.\u201d At the jewelry case, Maribelle straightened, patting her short gray hair into place. \u201cI might have to buy my granddaughter those pretty shell earrings. What do you want done now?\u201d</p> <p>The store suddenly felt confining, and Linda wanted out. \u201cIf you\u2019ll watch the store, I need to make a coffee run. Want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve had too much caffeine already.\u201d Maribelle took up position behind the counter as Linda stepped into the back to grab a few dollars from her purse.</p><p>The small coffee shop was a few stores down, and Linda had always enjoyed the short walk. Even in late January, the sounds of the beach were heartening. Children\u2019s shrieks of joy as the gulls dipped down to look for food, a small dog\u2019s high yapping, the thump and yells of the young men playing volleyball. Under it all, the shushing sound of the waves. She stopped to simply savor the cloudless blue sky over the blue-gray ocean and the white sand bedecked with brightly dressed tourists.</p><p>Could anyone who hadn\u2019t been imprisoned truly appreciate the glory of just being outside?</p><p>When she entered the coffee shop, the scent of newly brewed coffee zinged across her senses.</p><p>Waiting at the pickup counter for her order, the toy-store manager nodded at her. \u201cGood to have you back, hon.\u201d</p><p>Linda smiled. She didn\u2019t like the reminder of her ordeal, but the warmth of friendship was never unwelcome. \u201cThank you, Sandy.\u201d</p><p>Behind the counter, the coffee-shop owner handed Sandy her drink before looking over. \u201cLinda, what can I make you? The peppermint drinks are on sale today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm.\u201d Be virtuous or go for indulgence? She considered. Her body hurt and not in the happy way Sam had given her. Don\u2019t think of that. \u201cPeppermint white chocolate mocha.\u201d Caffeine, fat, sugar, and chocolate\u2014all the essential food groups except salt. \u201cThanks, Betty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing right up.\u201d</p><p>As Linda wavered over buying a scone, she heard whispers from a threesome at a table. Lawrence, who managed the upmarket art gallery, an older woman, and a woman from Linda\u2019s church.</p><p>Keen hearing was sometimes a curse, she thought. And hating herself for the weakness, she listened anyway.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. They kept her as a slave.\u201d The older woman.</p><p>The churchwoman said, \u201cA sex slave.\u201d</p><p>Linda felt as if her legs would give out.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Lawrence leaned forward. \u201cYou think she\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tears prickled in her eyes as Linda fought the urge to flee. To simply walk away from the coffee shop, her store, everything. To hide in her house and never come out. But what would that achieve except losing her business? The gossip would certainly continue. Tough it out, girl. Eventually, some new, ground-shaking scandal would replace hers.</p><p>She unclenched her hands and moved to the other end of the counter, close to their table, to wait for her drink.</p><p>The table went silent as the two women concentrated on their doughnuts. Lawrence gave her a slow perusal that made her skin crawl. \u201cHi, Linda. Taking a break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a coffee run.\u201d She forced her lips into a smile, then accepted her cup from Betty. Turning her back to the room to hide her trembling hands, she added extra sugar and eventually managed to get the plastic lid snapped on.</p><p>When she turned, the two women gawked at her as if she\u2019d worn pasties and a thong rather than her cream-colored, button-up shirt and tan slacks. When she stared back, their attention turned to their food.</p><p>She headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you again,\u201d Lawrence said.</p><p>She glanced over and nodded. \u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should get together sometime.\u201d His gaze dropped to her breasts, and he licked his lips.</p><p>Her anger flared. I\u2019m not a slut. Not. Taking a sip of coffee, she let her gaze slide down his body. After deliberately checking out his crotch area, she gave a dismissive sniff\u2014way too small\u2014and left the room.</p><p>Well, way to make yourself an enemy. She didn\u2019t care. At one time, she might have ignored Lawrence\u2019s sleazy stare. But the constant verbal abuse she\u2019d suffered as a slave had erased her tolerance.</p><p>\u201cSlut, that\u2019s all you are. Nothing else.\u201d The Overseer\u2019s voice, like putrid oil, still oozed through her memories. \u201cJust a convenient hole to use.\u201d She shuddered.</p><p>Then she recalled a different voice. \u201cLinda, I don\u2019t see you as a slave.\u201d The memory of Sam\u2019s rough words was like an afternoon downpour, washing the gutters clean of debris. His intent blue eyes had been hot, but he\u2019d shown respect as well. He\u2019d given her a safe word, mapped out what he\u2019d do, how far he\u2019d go.</p><p>The need to have his arms around her, his sandpapery voice in her ears, shook her so hard she stopped on the boardwalk. Breathe. Get it together. She drank her coffee, letting the burn settle her. How annoying for that sadist\u2019s voice to be so darned calming. What Sam sought from her might not be enslavement, but it wasn\u2019t what she wanted. Her life was normal now. She needed to keep it that way.</p><p>The comfort of her store wrapped around her as she entered. Since Maribelle was handling the customers, Linda picked up a wide basket and headed for the display window. Florida winter. What would look appropriately seasonal?</p><p>\u201cLinda? Hey, Linda!\u201d The man who walked in wore dark slacks and a long-sleeved shirt with garish red and purple stripes. His brown hair needed a trim.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dwayne.\u201d Before she met Lee, they\u2019d dated a few times until their one time in bed had shown her that they didn\u2019t suit. He made love as badly as he reported the news.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t returned my phone calls.\u201d He halted a step too close.</p><p>She retreated a pace. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched your testimony about being a sex slave.\u201d</p><p>Her mind blanked. Sex slave. She had never, ever called herself that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want an interview. You tell me what it was like, what they did to you, and I\u2019ll make you famous.\u201d</p><p>Startled at his insinuating tone and unwholesome interest, she couldn\u2019t speak. Did he really think she\u2019d give him a Penthouse-worthy report of the horrors she\u2019d suffered? \u201cI don\u2019t do interviews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about the other slave\u2014the blonde college kid? Were you close with Holly?\u201d</p><p>The name was a hammer blow to her heart. Her inability to protect the girl had been far more devastating than her powerlessness to protect herself. Holly had been so terrified, had pleaded with the Overseer to let her go home. She\u2019d been sold and died under the lash instead.</p> <p>Linda blinked hard. \u201cI\u2019m busy. Please leave.\u201d As customers turned to look, she set her face into an expressionless mask.</p><p>Dwayne swept his gaze down her body. His voice dropped. \u201cI gave it to you good, so why\u2019d you dump me? Cuz you\u2019d wanna be tied up when you\u2019re fucked? Did you have a better time with them than with me?\u201d</p><p>Her stomach twisted. \u201cGet out of my store!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Swallowing against the nausea, she yanked her cell phone out, punched two numbers, and turned it so he could see the display. Nine. One.</p> <p>He made an ugly sound and walked away, turning in the door to snarl, \u201cWelcome back, slave.\u201d</p><p>You bastard. Her skin had turned cold and clammy, and as she filled the basket with the contents of the display window, her chest grew tighter and tighter, making it hard to breathe. Abandoning the pretense, she hurried toward the back of the store. As she passed, the two gray-haired customers looked at her as if they smelled week-old garbage.</p><p>At the counter, Maribelle was oblivious as she bantered with two children.</p><p>The back room was cool. Dark. It didn\u2019t help. Oh God, oh God, oh God. The tears started. Then her stomach heaved, and she ran for the bathroom.</p><p>Crying. Shaking. Throwing up.</p><p>Finally she rested her face against the wall. Get up, Linda. Her body wouldn\u2019t move. She watched a tiny spider in the corner. Working so hard on its web. The cleaning lady would probably destroy all its work.</p> <p>That made her cry again.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Sunday finally arrived. Linda had given herself the whole day off to enjoy. A day for bare feet, ripped jeans, and a Queen Latifah T-shirt. She hadn\u2019t been ready to face church, so she and the children had rescheduled their traditional after-church dinner for the evening. In the meantime, she planned to ignore the outside world and just...settle.</p><p>As she finished putting her lunch dishes into the dishwasher, she realized she was singing along with an old Carpenters\u2019 song on the radio, \u201cI Need To Be in Love.\u201d She snorted. Wouldn\u2019t that just be a disaster, considering everything that had happened to her? Added to her past, she also had her strange desires...</p><p>Her jaw clenched. That horrible Dwayne. At least Lee had been polite, although the memory was still uncomfortable. Last fall after a couple of drinks, they\u2019d gone to bed, and she\u2019d asked for...more...trying to get him to bite, to spank. He\u2019d been appalled.</p><p>Her mouth turned down. The mortification she\u2019d felt with him had been the spur that sent her to a BDSM club. Like beads on a necklace, each event had led to the next and the next, until here she was. Postkidnapped. Kind of a mess. Trying to be normal.</p><p>She huffed a laugh, remembering the sting of Sam\u2019s hand hitting her bottom. Not exactly normal. Well, at least she was alive to whine about all her weird problems. And she was home, at last.</p><p>Sunlight streamed in through the big kitchen window, setting dust motes to dancing. Spirits lifting again, she sang the last line of the song into a pretend mic and finished with a quick spin before dropping the spatula into the rack. Yesterday at work had gone well. Her nightmares had decreased. She\u2019d had a big bacon, tomato, and lettuce sandwich for lunch. Yummy. Slavery had taught her how important the tiny things in life were. A smile instead of a frown. Comfort foods rather than slop. Kind words. A warm hug could be more satisfying than the most intense orgasm\u2014not that she\u2019d gotten off recently.</p> <p>Not since the night of the auction with Sam. A flush heated her cheeks. Damn the man.</p><p>Then again, maybe she should thank him. If it hadn\u2019t been for that night, she\u2019d think nothing would ever arouse her again.</p><p>She shook her head. Somehow he\u2019d simply overwhelmed her until all she\u2019d been able to see or hear was him. His voice. His touch. The pain. And he\u2019d driven her right to where he wanted her. Then humiliated her by making her orgasm. Her stomach clenched as she remembered the sleazy buyers leering at her. The slave next to her had stared, her face turning hard with a \u201chow could you?\u201d expression.</p><p>And Sam\u2014she hadn\u2019t been able to read him at all. She sighed. She still couldn\u2019t. Considering the way she\u2019d reacted to him at the Shadowlands, he hadn\u2019t lost his touch.</p><p>She wished she could say she responded sexually to any Dom, but that wouldn\u2019t be true. Sam had said they had chemistry between them. Then again, maybe it was just his lean, muscular body, sharp blue eyes, and aura of power that sparked her synapses into overdrive.</p><p>Or the way he talked... She put her hand over the flutter in her stomach. The man should have a license to kill for that voice. So deep and rough, like a gravel truck churning at the bottom of a chasm, with a flintlike edge that indicated he didn\u2019t take crap from anyone, especially a submissive.</p><p>She snorted. She\u2019d normally have a fit if some guy called her \u201cgirl,\u201d but when Sam said it, every molecule in her body turned liquid. Damn him.</p><p>Wiping her hands on a towel, she tried to consider what her next task should be. Having her thoughts fall into a Sam rut couldn\u2019t be permitted. She couldn\u2019t afford anything...warped...in her life. In her children\u2019s lives.</p><p>Brenna and Charles had told her about the horrible time they\u2019d suffered after she\u2019d been kidnapped. How they\u2019d panicked when no one could find her. They\u2019d been terrified for her. And then reporters had hounded them, playing on their fears, coming up with all the worst scenarios.</p><p>How much worse would it be if the newspeople\u2014or her children\u2014learned she\u2019d gone to a kink club?</p><p>But everything was returning to normal. The trials for the slavers were almost over. Her coworkers would forget her past. Her children could relax. She\u2019d never, ever do anything to cause a sensation again.</p><p>She\u2019d been Miss Boring and Respectable all her life, and being different had really not gone well.</p><p>After tossing the soiled towel in the laundry basket, she walked out the front door into the fresh air. She did that a lot\u2014just to prove she could go outside when she wanted to. Typical ex-prisoner behavior.</p><p>In her yard, she inhaled slowly. Nothing smelled as good as the breeze off the ocean. The sky was a deep blue with puffy clouds white enough for a bleach commercial. Spring was coming, but this was the prettiest time of the year. The St. Augustine grass was crisp and bright. In a garish flash of color, a flock of feral parakeets settled onto the next-door lawn. She grinned at them.</p><p>The counselor had said her emotions would go up and down, but duh\u2014that wasn\u2019t exactly news to anyone over twenty. One moment, a person celebrates a pregnancy, and the next, a father dies. A windfall of cash might be followed by a broken arm. Learn to stand up. Learn to fall down. Life\u2019s lessons didn\u2019t stop; they continued to the day of death.</p><p>And I\u2019m alive. That was the important thing. Alive and free and... She stared at her house. To the right of the door, black words had been spray-painted over the pale blue wall: BURN IN HELL WHORE OF SATAN.</p><p>No. No no no. Her stomach roiled. Hand over her mouth, she ran for the house.</p><p>Almost two hours later, she had sung every war song she knew as she scrubbed off the graffiti. Once finished, she frowned at the areas of lighter blue. Why in the world would someone do something like that? Whore of Satan. Excuse me?</p><p>Now that the words were gone, she could almost see the humor. It sounded like what her father\u2014may he rest in peace\u2014would roar during his pulpit-thumping sermons. \u201cAnd if you do not repent of your evil ways, then you will\u2014\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d considered the road to salvation to be extremely narrow. A good person needed faith, to do charitable works, to wear modest clothing, use respectful language, and observe proper behavior. Her sister, Wendy, had been cynical enough to ignore their parents\u2019 lectures, but Linda had never stopped trying to please them.</p><p>Her husband had been much like her father, but despite his conservative nature, at least Frederick had possessed a sense of humor.</p><p>A car door thudded, and as Linda turned, she heard, \u201cMom.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter was early. She plastered on a smile and dropped the brush behind the bushes. Thank goodness she\u2019d finished eradicating the words from the wall. \u201cBrenna!\u201d</p><p>In a denim skirt and white tank top, Brenna ran across the lawn to give Linda a long hug. \u201cOh, Mom, I missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you too, honey.\u201d Needing to stay strong for her baby, Linda blinked away tears and curved an arm around the girl. \u201cLet\u2019s go have some tea. I made cookies for you and Charles.\u201d</p><p>Brenna grimaced. \u201cMo-om. As if I\u2019m not fat enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly are not. You\u2019re lovely.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAs if.\u201d Hands waving in the air, Brenna led the way to the kitchen. \u201cMy ass is too big, my tits are like watermelons, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Linda shook her head. Although an inch shorter than Linda\u2019s five feet seven, Brenna was at least thirty pounds lighter and nowhere near Linda\u2019s full figure. But over the years, Linda had learned to like having a curvy body. Brenna hadn\u2019t yet. \u201cSweetie, you have a beautiful figure, but you\u2019re never going to be tall and slender. It\u2019s not in our genes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Shoving her light brown hair behind her ears, she scowled. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I have inherited Dad\u2019s tall and skinny genes like Charles did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t have a choice in that one.\u201d Linda spoke lightly, ignoring the feeling of rejection. \u201cHave you seen Charles lately?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot since we came over to make sure the house was okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciated you doing that.\u201d</p><p>Brenna shrugged away her mother\u2019s thanks. \u201cYou look good. Tan and like you\u2019ve been living the high life at Aunt Wendy\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Was that a hint of accusation in her words? Guilt tensed the muscles in Linda\u2019s chest. \u201cI spent a lot of time in Wendy\u2019s garden.\u201d Yanking out the stubborn quack grass ferociously as if to kill the monsters that\u2019d destroyed her life. Crying when the scent of blooming roses reminded her of her mother. Shaking and vomiting. The oddest things had affected her, like when her shovel had cut a worm in half. She\u2019d gone into hysterics for half the day. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t the high life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom.\u201d Tears welled in her daughter\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back, but sometimes I just... I don\u2019t know why I said that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, baby.\u201d Linda hugged her girl, trying to work past the hurt. Brenna wasn\u2019t cruel. \u201cDo you remember when you ran away because I wouldn\u2019t let you go to a sleepover? You took your wagon with all your dolls in it.\u201d</p><p>Brenna choked on a laugh. \u201cWhen I was in kindergarten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. For hours, we searched for you. You turned up at Myrtle\u2019s, playing with her grandchildren. We were so relieved. We hugged you and kissed you. But then\u2014\u201d</p><p>Brenna pulled away. \u201cDaddy yelled at me. So did you. You guys never yelled, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. But when you\u2019ve been so scared, sometimes you react all over the person who scared you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d After a moment\u2019s silence, she nodded. \u201cOkay. I get it. I\u2019ll try not to take it out on you.\u201d Brenna wiped the tears from her eyes and attempted a frown. \u201cBut if I see you packing your dolls in the car, I\u2019m going to yell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d Heavens, how did we make such beautiful children, Frederick? \u201cWant to help me get food on for supper? Charles should be here in a couple of hours, and I have the makings for a pot roast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, duh. Does a bear sh\u2014\u201d She caught her mother\u2019s warning look and adroitly substituted, \u201cPoop in the woods? Can we add those little potatoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, duh.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Sitting in his friend\u2019s great room, Sam took a long drink of beer. Raoul\u2019s home was a warm mix of Mediterranean and beach house. The patio doors stood open to let the sea breezes enter. With luck, the crisp air would unmuddle his brain.</p><p>Over a week had passed since the night at the Shadowlands when Linda had melted against him, given him everything he\u2019d asked for, and then pushed him away. She wanted nothing to do with him.</p><p>He understood...somewhat. Didn\u2019t help his mood. He\u2019d cleaned out the old stable, then started on the chicken house. Shoveling shit had suited his mood perfectly.</p><p>Yesterday the Internet alerts he\u2019d set up on Linda\u2019s name had rewarded him with a newspaper article. After reading it\u2014and stewing\u2014he paid Raoul and Kim a visit. Maybe Raoul would know how to handle the situation. Damn the redhead for being so stubborn, and damn Sam for being an idiot. Damn him again for wanting a woman who hated the sight of him.</p> <p>Only she didn\u2019t. Not from the way she\u2019d responded at the Shadowlands.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>He looked up from his can of beer to see Raoul\u2019s pretty slave smiling at him from where she knelt beside her Master. With her black hair and striking blue eyes, she was pretty enough, but her spiritedness and caring nature were what had caught his friend. How someone so sweet had survived the slavers... Well, he knew another sweet woman who\u2019d also survived.</p><p>\u201cYes, Kim?\u201d The two women were very different. Kim created sparks and light wherever she went\u2014and she\u2019d livened up Raoul\u2019s life. Linda\u2019s personality was a steady fire, she had a compelling core of strength to draw upon, and she was as stubborn as a stump.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some dessert?\u201d Kim asked. \u201cI made chocolate cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a bit. Have you spoken to Linda recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since she left. Her choice. She didn\u2019t want to be reminded of the past, at least as she settled in.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that\u2019s what he\u2019d been afraid of. He glanced at Raoul, who was stroking Kim\u2019s hair. \u201cI\u2019d like a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Raoul answered instantly. Although the man had the cynical practicality of an engineer who\u2019d built an international company from scratch, his loyalty came with no strings attached.</p><p>\u201cThe Foggy Shores newspaper reported that Linda\u2019s house was spray-painted with something ugly.\u201d Although the tone of the article was pseudosweet, it had played up the gossip. Pissed Sam off thoroughly, and if the reporter had been in reach, the bastard would be spitting out teeth. Maybe his readers would enjoy that write-up as well.</p><p>Raoul\u2019s dark brown eyes filled with anger. \u201cHas she not been through enough?\u201d When Kim leaned against his thigh, he wrapped his arm around her, pulling her closer. \u201cAll of them suffered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently someone doesn\u2019t think so.\u201d Sam rubbed his chin, a bad feeling growing inside him. He knew how bad homecomings could be. No, she wasn\u2019t a Vietnam vet, fresh from an unwinnable war, but death and cruelty weren\u2019t confined to battlegrounds. \u201cMade me think, though. Kim had problems when she returned home, even with her mother to help. I don\u2019t think Linda has much support at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not.\u201d Raoul ran his fingers along the leather collar that Kim wore. \u201cWould you call her now, gatita? So Sam might know whether to worry. Hopefully, we\u2019ll discover she is fine.\u201d</p><p>Sam met his gaze. Any Dom would be concerned about a submissive who\u2019d been in his care. However, he didn\u2019t give a damn if Raoul figured out that Sam worried extra about Linda. \u201cAppreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Kim brought a phone from the other room and punched in the number. A few seconds later, she said, \u201cLinda, it\u2019s Kim. I called to see how you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>The answer she got put a line between her brows. \u201cYou\u2019re fine? Honey, you don\u2019t sound all that good.\u201d</p><p>Sam scowled. Obviously Linda was damn well not fine.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s it like to be home?\u201d</p><p>All Sam could hear was a faint buzz.</p><p>Kim\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cThat\u2019s bull. You don\u2019t have anything to do right now, and you\u2019re not getting off the phone so easy. You\u2019ve been crying, haven\u2019t you? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Sam growled, and Raoul sat forward.</p><p>The little slave rolled her eyes at them, but her frown was real. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve been around Doms too long, and yes, I\u2019m stubborn. So tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Sam forced himself to sit back and not grab the phone. At least Kim was thoughtfully repeating bits of what Linda said.</p><p>Kim listened for a minute. \u201cSpray-painted your house? What did it say?\u201d</p><p>The answer made her eyes flash. \u201cSunday, Tuesday, and last night too? Linda, that\u2019s a little past persistent. Are the police doing anything?\u201d</p><p>Anger surged through Sam so fiercely that he crushed the can in his hand. The bastard had struck three times in a week. What if he decided to escalate?</p><p>Raoul looked worried. He undoubtedly wanted to help. But his engineering company was swamped with work, and he was still behind from last fall when Kim had taken all his time.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you say. I\u2019m sending you some help, one way or another.\u201d Kim\u2019s mouth flattened into a straight line.</p><p>As she wound up the phone call, Sam considered. Foggy Shores wasn\u2019t far from his house. He\u2019d have to be home in the mornings to open the security gate when Nolan\u2019s crew arrived, but the neighbor\u2019s kid could handle the evening chores and reset the alarm. Everything else could wait. Didn\u2019t sound as if Linda could. \u201cI\u2019ll go tomorrow,\u201d he told Raoul.</p><p>A tapping noise wakened Linda. She tensed, expecting the Overseer\u2019s boot to slam into her ribs.</p><p>Nothing touched her.</p><p>Heart pounding, she cautiously opened her eyes and saw her own living room. Home. I\u2019m home. Right. Worked all morning in the store. Indulged in a late-afternoon nap.</p><p>She jumped as the sound came again. Someone was knocking on the front door. Someone had scared her to death. She pursed her lips to slow her breathing. Where was a nice pistol when she needed one? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But when she cocked her thumb and aimed her finger at the door, her gun hand shook uncontrollably. Guess obtaining a real gun wouldn\u2019t work. Besides, her elderly postman would have a heart attack if bullets peppered the front stoop. It was probably him at the door now.</p><p>The knocking reverberated through her room, sounding a bit annoyed. The old guy had quite a fist on him.</p><p>Wiping the sweat from her face, Linda rose. \u201cComing.\u201d Her voice didn\u2019t reach past the end of the couch. \u201cComing!\u201d After a few steps, her knees firmed up. She smoothed her sleeveless shirt and capris, attempted a smile, and opened the door.</p><p>No one was there.</p> <p>She stepped outside to see a man in front of her house. \u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>It really was him, in person, as if her dreams had conjured him out of thin air. The sunlight glinted off the gray strands in his collar-length hair. When he glanced at her, his pale eyes gleamed like light through clear blue glass.</p><p>He turned his attention back to the newest graffiti. BITCH OF SATAN. \u201cLeast the words are spelled right. Nice change from most,\u201d he said mildly and winked.</p><p>The half joke wasn\u2019t funny, yet it eased the fearful tenseness she\u2019d had since discovering the ugly words. In fact, just his presence carried a sense of security with it. How did he do that?</p><p>As he walked closer, his shrewd gaze assessed her. \u201cYou look like hell, girl. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do business on a doorstep.\u201d He grasped her upper arms, moved her so he could enter, and closed the door behind him. \u201cGot something to drink? Water or tea or soda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She was halfway to the kitchen before stopping. Boy, talk about automatic obedience. \u201cExcuse me, but I don\u2019t recall inviting you here. How did you get my address?\u201d Her hands tried to rub the chill from her arms. Had she found another kind of a stalker?</p><p>\u201cLooked it up on the Internet.\u201d Her discomfort lightened when he sat down in an armchair, extended his long legs, and made himself at home. He obviously wasn\u2019t planning to jump on her. \u201cRaoul couldn\u2019t come. I was available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Kim I didn\u2019t need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she told you she was sending help.\u201d He gave her a level stare. \u201cGirl, you\u2019ve been through enough grief. Let me help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut...\u201d She scowled. If the cases had been reversed, she\u2019d have sent someone to Kim. And from the tilt of Sam\u2019s jaw, arguing wouldn\u2019t get her anywhere. \u201cFine. Diet cola, Mountain Dew, or root beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDew, thanks.\u201d</p><p>When she returned with his drink and a root beer for herself, he was studying her living room with the same intensity as he normally watched her. In jeans, worn brown boots, and a short-sleeved, button-up work shirt, he didn\u2019t seem as if interior decor would interest him.</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s so fascinating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe colors. Brown, beige, off-white. Like you\u2014warm but subdued.\u201d He took his drink from her and gestured toward the high windows. \u201cBlinds up, lots of light. Not hiding.\u201d He pointed at the bright floral pillows and ran a finger over the silk-covered one at his feet, then patted the chair. \u201cYou like beauty but want comfort with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d He was disconcertingly accurate.</p><p>The two acoustic guitars in the corner got an interested look. \u201cAny chance you like country-western?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to try plucking out a few tunes.\u201d</p><p>Since Charles moved out, she hadn\u2019t had anyone at home with whom to share music. She took a step toward the guitars and caught herself. Don\u2019t be insane. He hadn\u2019t driven to Foggy Shores to strum a guitar. \u201cSo you\u2019re here to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne spray painting is a prank. More is a problem. You need some backup.\u201d</p><p>Just the word\u2014backup\u2014sent relief welling inside her. As tears prickled in her eyes, she busied herself with opening her root beer.</p><p>When she finally looked up, his hard blue eyes had softened. She hadn\u2019t hidden a thing. Odd how even the nastiest customers never realized what she thought of their behavior. But this man read her as accurately as if he had an instruction manual titled How to Understand Linda.</p><p>And he\u2019d driven here to help her. \u201cYou...you don\u2019t have to. We\u2019re not even\u2014\u201d She stopped, realizing how rude that would sound.</p><p>He finished for her. \u201cFriends. I know. I screwed up at the auction and made things more difficult for you. I owe you.\u201d Blunt. Rough. Devastatingly honest.</p><p>However, the past wasn\u2019t something he could fix. Not like this. She searched for a polite response. Settled on, \u201cYou were trying to help.\u201d And actually, he had. Otherwise, a real buyer would have whipped her. Hurt her. If only he\u2019d stopped before...touching...her. Her face warmed, and she sipped against the uncomfortable twisting in her stomach. The mild bite of carbonation anchored her.</p><p>He looked as if he wanted to say something. Instead, he drank, swallow after swallow, his Adam\u2019s apple moving up and down, drawing her attention to his tanned, corded neck. The small hollow at the base was surrounded by muscles. She remembered the press of his body, a solid warm wall of flesh, and the room heated to match her face. What in the world was wrong with her?</p><p>\u201cWhen does this happen? At night?\u201d</p><p>She could almost feel a bed under her before realizing he was referring to the graffiti. She gave an involuntary snort. How could she possibly have lewd thoughts about this intimidating man? \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else going on?\u201d He glanced at the pile of newspapers on an end table. \u201cDid you make the paper again today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHogwash. Show me, Linda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Why did she feel as if she was going to cry? She walked across the room to where she\u2019d put the ripped-out page on a bookshelf with the first, unable to destroy them, unable to look at them. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>He took the paper. When he pulled a pair of reading glasses from his work-shirt pocket, she blinked. The glasses made him look...different. As if the jeans and rough behavior were a cover for the intelligent person beneath. After reading the article, he set the paper aside, and a tremor ran through her at the cold anger in his face.</p><p>\u201cThe reporter should be horsewhipped.\u201d</p><p>She took the paper from his lap and tossed it into the wastebasket. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter. There\u2019s nothing you can do about it. I think you\u2019d better go home.\u201d</p><p>He sipped his drink and watched her pace across the room.</p><p>She stopped. \u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d He wasn\u2019t moving.</p><p>\u201cGo home, Sam.\u201d</p><p>When she glared at him, he actually looked pleased. \u201cNot much I can do about the reporter. Legally. But maybe your spray painter will show up tonight.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder at the hallway. \u201cGot a place for me to sleep?\u201d</p><p>She had to wonder if he raised cattle, because, oh boy, his expression was definitely a bullheaded one.</p><p>Half an hour later, as Sam scrubbed and scraped the black paint off Linda\u2019s house, fury lashed his insides like a hailstorm. What kind of bastard picked on a woman\u2014any woman\u2014let alone one who had already suffered so much? He looked forward to getting his hands on the man. Be a pleasure to dispense a short, hard lesson in manners.</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d She wore midcalf-length shorts\u2014whatever they were called\u2014and flip-flops. Her full breasts strained against her green top as she pulled her heavy red hair into a short tail. If her hair was a bit longer, he could wrap it around his fist. Less clothing would be good too. But no matter what she wore, she\u2019d probably still warm his blood.</p><p>Scraper in hand, she joined him. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course I do.\u201d The places where bare wood showed had obviously been written on before.</p><p>\u201cWell, I appreciate it.\u201d She vigorously scrubbed at the black paint, and he noticed her freckled arms looked well toned.</p><p>Checking, he ran his hand over her upper arm and felt muscle beneath the soft padding.</p><p>She froze, staring up at him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Why did he feel a magnetic pull every time he looked down into her big brown eyes? \u201cYou\u2019ve put some muscle on. Been working out?\u201d He kept his hand on her, feeling the slight quiver. Seeing nervousness replace fear.</p><p>\u201cI-I was at my sister\u2019s house. In California.\u201d She pulled from his grasp and examined her arm as if she hadn\u2019t seen it before. \u201cShe has a huge garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGardens are good for mending.\u201d</p><p>She slanted him a disbelieving look. \u201cDid you ever have anything to mend?\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened. But he\u2019d finally got her talking. Backing away would silence her again. \u201c\u2019Nam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d She studied him. \u201cYou were old enough to be in Vietnam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy recruiter cousin fudged the papers for me.\u201d Because his cuz had known about his stepfather\u2019s heavy hand. Pa had been a good man, but Ma hadn\u2019t chosen so well the second time.</p><p>\u201cDear God.\u201d She looked at him as if seeing the tall, lanky kid he\u2019d been. Seeing him with a mother\u2019s eyes. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLong time ago.\u201d At least he\u2019d turned sixteen before his unit deployed. Nonetheless, he\u2019d spent the next two years in hell. \u201cThe US pulled out when I hit eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were just a baby.\u201d Tears swam in her eyes, melting his memories.</p><p>\u201cNah. They don\u2019t call babies \u2018sergeant.\u2019\u201d He\u2019d stayed in the army until his mother\u2019s and stepfather\u2019s deaths in a boating accident.</p><p>To erase Linda\u2019s tears, he cupped her chin. Her lips were soft. Sweet. And trembled slightly under his. When her hand pushed against his chest, he released her immediately. There would be other times.</p> <p>\u201cWhere did you garden?\u201d She sounded breathless, and he smothered a smile.</p><p>\u201cGot some acres.\u201d Although his stepfather had sold off parts of his father\u2019s farm and run what was left into the ground, Sam had built it back up. Reacquired all the pieces and expanded as well. \u201cAnd a vegetable garden.\u201d She had a faint dimple in her right cheek. He hadn\u2019t noticed it before.</p><p>\u201cKim said you had a place, but she didn\u2019t know if it was a ranch or a farm.\u201d</p><p>So she\u2019d talked about him with others. When his lips tilted up, her face pinkened.</p><p>\u201cNot much of a ranch with only a few horses and some cattle.\u201d He frowned as another brown patch of wood was exposed by the scrubbing. Looked like hell. After pulling out his cell, he punched in Nolan King\u2019s number.</p> <p>\u201cKing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavies. Friend\u2019s house got sprayed with graffiti. You got any of that special paint? Just need enough for the front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any at the moment. The shit expires fast. Got more ordered for a downtown job, though. You can have some when it comes in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll do.\u201d Closing the phone, Sam noticed Linda\u2019s confused expression. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not get something from the paint store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey only have gloss coatings. With King\u2019s industrial stuff, the spray paint will run right off\u2014won\u2019t even stick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her eyes lit up, and she grinned at him. \u201cI\u2019d love to see the jerk\u2019s face if that happened.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, pleased to have lifted her mood. In fact, it was disconcerting what he\u2019d do to keep that light in her eyes.</p><p>But as he turned his attention back to the last letter on the wall, his anger ignited again. Probably wouldn\u2019t die down until he met the bastard artist up close and personal.</p><p>Linda glanced at the kitchen table where Sam sat. The big, mean sadist had completed his assignment and neatly diced the vegetables. Should she be worried about how he got so skilled with a knife? \u201cVery nice.\u201d After scooping them into a bowl, she dumped the contents into the meat sauce simmering on the stove.</p><p>His eyebrows went up.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know most people don\u2019t put veggies in their spaghetti sauce, but my children were fussy. I call it guerilla nutrition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSneaky.\u201d His smile was as slow as his words. He didn\u2019t have a drawl exactly\u2014he just took his time. And the smile didn\u2019t last long, but for a moment it totally transformed his face.</p><p>Not fair that he should look so appealing and comfortable in her kitchen. She spun back to the stove. After rinsing the noodles in the colander, she started creating the lasagna. It was a time-consuming dish, but she\u2019d hoped to keep her hands busy and her mind occupied. Having Sam in her house was like inviting a grizzly bear in for a snack.</p> <p>And yet having him here was incredibly reassuring. He knew who she was, what she\u2019d been through, and he still...liked her. Or maybe not. Maybe he just felt guilty.</p><p>\u201cNice kitchen,\u201d he commented. His gaze shifted from the cream-colored pine cupboards to the dark blue walls to the golden marble countertops. He frowned as he studied the woven basket holding oranges, a tall coiled basket filled with wooden spoons, and the potted herbs inside colorful twined baskets. When he spotted the box of reeds on the kitchen shelves, he asked, \u201cYou do the baskets yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of them.\u201d After setting a platter of cheese and crackers on the table, she pointed to a hand-sized plaited basket that held a variety of stones. The shape had odd bulges, and the weaving looked as if she\u2019d been intoxicated. \u201cI started when I was in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve improved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you.\u201d She grinned. \u201cYou know, you have a talent for being blunt without being quite rude.\u201d He gave her a contemplative stare as if he\u2019d never had a woman tease him. Then again, who in their right mind would tease a sadist?</p><p>\u201cTakes too much work to be rude.\u201d He nodded at a pile of baskets in a corner. \u201cYou planning something for those?\u201d</p><p>She started the alternating layers of noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, and sauce. \u201cI sell them at my store; otherwise I\u2019d be buried in them. Hobbies are like zucchini\u2014your friends and family can only absorb so much.\u201d</p><p>He snorted in agreement before loading a cracker with cheese. \u201cNicole quilts. Got one on every bed in the house. Couple hang on the walls.\u201d</p><p>Her hands stilled as a pang stabbed through her. Not...quite...pain. \u201cNicole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even considered that he\u2019d have a family. He seemed to stand alone, like a cliff above the ocean. And yet what woman wouldn\u2019t want him? She stared down at the long casserole pan. \u201cYou\u2019re married?\u201d Did he cheat on his wife?</p><p>With a creak of the chair, he rose to stand behind her. Ignoring the way she froze, he put his arm around her waist, holding her firmly against him. \u201cI\u2019m divorced.\u201d He huffed a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m a sadist, girl, not a cheater.\u201d</p><p>Even as relief streamed through her, she had to wonder how he could so easily say that. \u201cI\u2019m a sadist.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>What was that? Sam opened his eyes, frowning at the darkness in Linda\u2019s living room. For the previous three nights, he had slept on her couch. Although she\u2019d offered a guest room, he had refused. In a back bedroom, he wouldn\u2019t hear a thing. He was here to catch the spray-painting bastard, not be comfortable.</p><p>He listened but heard only the hum of the refrigerator and slight ticking of the ceiling fan. The atmosphere of the house was cozy, clean without being obsessive, beautiful without being formal.</p><p>The first night, Linda had eventually relaxed after he\u2019d talked her into playing guitar with him. Like Tanya Tucker, she had a low, rich voice that added a haunting quality to every song. He\u2019d kept forgetting to play so he could listen.</p><p>The next evening, she\u2019d let him pull her down beside him to watch a spy thriller. Warm body. Soft hips and shoulders. She had fit against his side as if she belonged there.</p><p>When she\u2019d discovered he liked pie, he\u2019d had homemade pie every night to go with her home-cooked meals. The woman was so grateful he was liable to put on twenty pounds.</p><p>Don\u2019t get attached to this one, Davies. He rubbed his chin, knowing it was already too late. She\u2019d captivated him the moment he\u2019d seen her, which seemed a mite odd. He wasn\u2019t some pimple-faced boy to fall for a girl on first sight, but he had. Maybe it was a sign of going senile?</p><p>Rustles. A thump. Sam rose. The sounds weren\u2019t from outside. He tracked the noise to Linda\u2019s bedroom and stopped outside, grinning. Was she playing with toys, having a good time?</p><p>Then he heard her whimper, her voice thin with fear. \u201cNo, no, please. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? Set to attack an intruder, Sam shoved the door open. A golden night-light revealed an empty room except for Linda thrashing on the bed in the throes of a nightmare. Hell, after what she\u2019d endured, she probably had a lot of them. Her pale face gleamed with sweat. As her fingernails clawed the covers, his heart squeezed with pity.</p><p>He took a step forward and stopped. Which would she find more terrifying: a nightmare or Sam in her bedroom?</p><p>Probably him.</p><p>But his jaw clenched at the sounds of her fear. Scowling, he set a wooden chair a few feet from the bed, then sat and rested his elbows on his knees. A deep breath allowed him to calm his expression. The little sub didn\u2019t need to see an angry man at her bedside. \u201cLinda. Linda, it\u2019s time to wake up.\u201d</p><p>Her movements stilled and then started again.</p><p>He deepened his voice to add a note of command. \u201cLinda. Wake up now.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, and her eyes popped open. For a minute she lay as still as a petrified mouse. Then she turned her head slowly and looked around the room. Her muscles relaxed. Her gaze finally came to rest on him. \u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood guess.\u201d She hadn\u2019t panicked at the sight of him. Finest gift he\u2019d had in a long time. \u201cYou had a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou woke me up?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She sat up and pushed her damp hair out of her face. The covers pooled around her waist, and her breasts wobbled under the thin nightgown.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d He cursed silently at his hardening cock. She didn\u2019t need any reminders of what assholes men could be. Intending to leave, he stood, but her wide brown eyes were too vulnerable. Too haunted. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, baby?\u201d Moving slowly enough she could evade his touch, he ran his hand over her damp cheek.</p><p>Rather than pulling back, she leaned into his palm. The trust in the movement tightened his chest. \u201cI\u2019m still scared,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can feel them...the way they touched me. How it hurt.\u201d Her breath hitched. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam wasn\u2019t the one she feared. He sat on the bed, facing her, and pulled her into his arms so her head rested on his shoulder, her breasts against his chest. Closing his eyes, he treasured the chance to give her the comfort a man could offer.</p><p>Her hair always smelled of lavender with a hint of citrus\u2014lime, maybe\u2014and her gown was silky under his rough hands. All woman, this one. \u201cYou get a lot of nightmares?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders moved in a shrug, and she sighed, her breath a hint of warmth through his shirt. \u201cThey were getting better but increased again when I moved home.\u201d</p><p>Sam stiffened. \u201cDoes having me here make them worse?\u201d He could always bunk in his truck if\u2014</p> <p>\u201cNo. No.\u201d Her forehead rubbed against his chest. \u201cThey were nastier when I was here alone. I feel safe around you.\u201d Her throaty laugh was rueful. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the damnedest thing?\u201d</p><p>No, because he\u2019d protect her against the goddamned world if he had to. He stroked her back. Slowly. Silk over softness. \u201cIt\u2019s good. Now tell me why you were angry with me at the auction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She tried to pull back, and he tightened his grip.</p><p>\u201cNo. Talk to me, girl.\u201d He doubted he\u2019d share if he were in her position, but hell, that\u2019s why he got to be the Dom. \u201cI got you off, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a man.\u201d She huffed out a breath. \u201cWomen don\u2019t see things the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNoticed that.\u201d</p><p>Damned if she didn\u2019t give a snorting laugh. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s like this. They took everything from us. Clothes, speech. Took our b-bodies. All our choices. Our...humanity.\u201d</p><p>Our. Well if she found it easier to talk in generalities, he wouldn\u2019t correct her. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>She had her arms around him, and now her fingers dug into his back. Another connection. \u201cAll I\u2014we\u2014had left, all we could control were our thoughts. I stayed cold. Wouldn\u2019t give them the satisfaction of seeing they affected me.\u201d</p><p>He considered her strained voice. Rich buyers were egotistical assholes. A slave\u2019s lack of fear wouldn\u2019t go over well. \u201cDidn\u2019t that make it worse for you?\u201d</p><p>Her body tensed.</p> <p>Yeah, it had gotten worse. He shut down the urge to slam his fist into something.</p><p>She whispered into his neck, \u201cThey got mad, especially the Overseer. But being frozen was the only way I could fight back. Then with you that night, I couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell. I took away your control and made you come.\u201d</p><p>Her head moved up and down on his shoulder. \u201cIn front of all of them. They were...watching.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cThe slave next to me... She looked at me like I\u2019d betrayed her.\u201d</p><p>Damn. He\u2019d known there was a reason she\u2019d been so upset and angry, but it was worse than he\u2019d figured. He\u2019d undermined everything she\u2019d fought to accomplish. Forced her own body to betray her. He was a damned fool. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Linda. I wouldn\u2019t have...not if I\u2019d realized.\u201d</p><p>Her breasts flattened on his chest as she pulled in a breath. \u201cAt first, I figured you made me get off for kicks. Just to prove you could.\u201d</p><p>A flicker of anger woke at the realization she\u2019d lined him up with the assholes.</p><p>\u201cBut I know you better now. You didn\u2019t need to prove anything. You already knew what you could do to me. You even said as much.\u201d Her hands tightened on his back. \u201cYou thought you were doing me a favor, didn\u2019t you? Because you\u2019re a guy, and that\u2019s how men think about orgasms.\u201d</p> <p>The sense of being forgiven was like stepping into the warmth of a Florida sun after being in dry air-conditioning. \u201cI should have thought more carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It wasn\u2019t a place where you had time to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He closed his eyes, remembering the noise\u2014crying and screaming. The auctioneer playing to the buyers\u2019 debased demands. The despair in the room had been a swamp, pulling him down. The stench of fear and sick lust had made it difficult to breathe, harder not to be sick. \u201cIt gave me nightmares too, girl.\u201d</p><p>WHAT A THING for a strong man to admit. Linda rolled her forehead against his shoulder. With a half laugh, he moved to lie flat on his back and pulled her down beside him. His muscles rippled as he arranged her so her cheek rested on his shoulder. His arms were iron bands around her, holding her closely, and the remnants of the nightmare melted in the warmth of his body.</p><p>How long had it been since she\u2019d let herself be snuggled? Long before the kidnapping. Not with that jerk Dwayne\u2014she\u2019d just wanted him gone. And sweet as Lee was, he didn\u2019t cuddle.</p><p>This was...nice. She breathed in the clean fragrance of his shirt, and deeper, his masculine scent, and squirmed closer. But when she flung her left leg over his, she bumped into a hard erection. An appalled sound escaped her, and she tensed.</p><p>\u201cGirl.\u201d The single chastising word somehow conveyed an entire speech of how he wouldn\u2019t do anything she didn\u2019t want and how guys get erections and she was being silly. All in one word.</p><p>A tiny laugh escaped her, because that was so...Sam. She\u2019d seen the way he watched her, how he desired her, yet he never made her feel sleazy or dirty. Just...wanted. \u201cSam, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep. Morning comes soon enough.\u201d</p><p>The hint of amusement and the stillness of his body eased the last of her worry, and she obeyed, letting the sense of safety tumble her into slumber.</p><p>Sunlight through the curtains wakened her. He was gone, and she\u2019d had her best sleep in months. The sheets still held his scent, and she pulled the pillow to her, breathing in all that was Sam. Feeling her body waken. Dampen. Come alive.</p><p>That evening, Linda slipped into bed, the coolness of the sheets contrasting with her warm body. All day, she\u2019d felt as if her body was playing a song like Pachelbel\u2019s \u201cCanon\u201d...and the melody with all its variations and repetitions was named desire.</p><p>When Sam had arrived that evening, the entire orchestra joined in.</p><p>And now she was ready. Surely she was.</p><p>After getting home from work, she\u2019d taken a long bubble bath, then shaved her legs and underarms...and her pussy. She smiled, remembering her first awkward attempt at shaving down there\u2014after her best friend had asked Linda if she intended to mourn her husband forever. That week, so long ago, she\u2019d had her hair restyled, changed her makeup, bought brighter clothing, and...shaved. For the first time since Frederick\u2019s death, she had felt like a woman.</p><p>She certainly felt like a woman tonight. After Sam had arrived, Linda had fixed supper and scolded him for cutting the carrots too small. His swift grin had set up a beat low in her pelvis. When she\u2019d talked him into playing guitar with her, the sight of his strong fingers wrapped around the neck of the guitar had mesmerized her. When he had picked out a scary movie, she\u2019d agreed, wanting only a reason to burrow into him on the couch.</p><p>Every breath had held his scent of the crisp outdoors. Whole and right. And the buzz of awareness that said she was with a man\u2014one she wanted\u2014had never faded.</p><p>When the time grew late, he hadn\u2019t confused her with choices. Far too experienced in reading women\u2014in reading her\u2014he\u2019d pulled her to her feet and told her to get ready for bed. That he\u2019d be in soon.</p><p>Under the covers, she waited, worries swelling and clogging her throat until she couldn\u2019t swallow. The sheets were cool. Surely that\u2019s why she was shivering.</p><p>His footsteps were softer than normal. He\u2019d removed his boots. As he entered the room, though, she saw he still wore his jeans. Thank you, God.</p><p>In silence, he pulled the covers back and settled beside her. Warm.</p><p>She snuggled against his side with a sigh.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, letting her take things at her own speed. Letting her decide. The beauty of his patience made her eyes well with tears.</p><p>The knowledge that he wanted her sent a hum through her system. I know him. He\u2019d touched her intimately at the auction. Again at the Shadowlands. Hands calloused from work moving over her skin. His deep voice whispering in her ear.</p><p>She wanted him, oh yes, but could she have sex with him without panicking? In San Diego, she\u2019d thought she\u2019d be celibate for...oh, a decade or so. At least. But that was before Sam had set desire simmering deep inside her.</p><p>But now what?</p><p>In grade school, she\u2019d been so shy that reading aloud had terrified her, and if she stalled, her nervousness increased until she couldn\u2019t speak at all. So she would always volunteer to go first.</p><p>Now, even as she lay beside Sam, her anxiety was rising. Time to start while she still could. She pushed up onto one elbow.</p><p>In the dim light, his face was shadowy as his pale eyes studied her face. \u201cTell me what you want to do.\u201d</p><p>She took his hand from her shoulder and moved it to her breast. \u201cI want to...to try.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even pretend to misunderstand her. \u201cAll right.\u201d His answer was immediate. Simple. \u201cWe\u2019re not playing now though. \u2018No\u2019 means no. \u2018Stop\u2019 means stop. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>Not playing, but you couldn\u2019t take the Dom out of the man. He was still setting the rules. Her lips quivered, then curved. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His laugh was a rumbled chuckle before he kissed her. Oh, she remembered his lips. Firm and knowledgeable, but more gentle this time. As if he\u2019d let her decide how fast and how far they\u2019d go.</p><p>\u201cCondoms?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She rolled away, grabbed a packet from the bedside table, and returned to his arms before she lost her nerve.</p><p>As he pulled the condom from her clenched fingers, the war started inside her. How could she have asked him for sex? That was disgusting. Sleazy. Bad. She was bad.</p> <p>When he kissed her, her body stiffened. He lifted his head, his lips an inch from hers. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>I want this. I don\u2019t. I shouldn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t want to...decide.\u201d She felt wrong. Dirty. Wanting to have sex was\u2014</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and then he gripped her hair, holding her head immobile as he took her lips. Not cruelly, not like...them. Them. The slavers. Like an avalanche, memories swept over her, flattening her.</p><p>A nasty pinch on her thigh made her jerk. \u201cStay with me, girl.\u201d His growling voice was like sandpaper, scraping away the horrors, digging down to where her nerves were alive. \u201cSay my name.\u201d</p><p>His unyielding expression set up a trembling in her belly that had nothing to do with fear. \u201cSam.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgain.\u201d His left arm around her waist tightened as he closed his other hand on her breast. Cupping, kneading, tugging. His penetrating gaze stayed on her face, and his fingers closed on her nipple. And pinched...</p><p>When the pressure turned to pain, sensation streamed in a wave of light and heat straight to her core. \u201cSam.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved in a ruthless smile. \u201cGood that you respond to the reins.\u201d His hand moved to her other breast, no longer gentle but demanding. Yet...careful. Never with the careless brutality that the Overseer\u2014 \u201cOw!\u201d Her hip stung where he\u2019d given it a mean pinch.</p><p>\u201cWhen I want you to think, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d And how could such an arrogant statement make her stomach drop? He took her lips again, and at the same time she felt him untying the lacing at the top of her nightgown, pushing it to her waist in a whisper of cool silk. His hand returned to her bare breasts. Calloused, abrasive...warm.</p><p>\u201cI look forward to using clamps on these,\u201d he whispered in her ear, tugging and pinching. \u201cThey\u2019ll hurt like this.\u201d His fingernail dug into the tender flesh until she gasped at the burning pain. He bit her shoulder, adding a new sting to the ones bombarding her body.</p><p>Too much. One of the guards had... When they\u2019d all... Hands and agony and... She shoved away frantically, gasping for air.</p> <p>He released her immediately. But before she could escape, he gripped her shoulders and gave her a firm shake. \u201cLook at me, girl.\u201d</p><p>That growl\u2014it haunted her dreams and chased away nightmares. Her eyes popped open and met the blue fire of his. \u201cSam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>She was trembling hard enough to shake the bed as he sat up next to her. He gripped her, anchoring her with firmness, the levelness of his gaze holding her in safety.</p><p>Her heart rate slowed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The sun lines around his eyes deepened. \u201cYou can control your body only so far. Stupid to blame anyone for a physical reaction.\u201d</p><p>And no matter how gruff his language, Sam was very far from a stupid person. But she felt dumb. \u201cWhy was it easier? At the auction.\u201d</p><p>Holding her shoulder with one hand, he ran his fingers through her hair, tugging slightly. \u201cMore than one reason. In a room of scumbags, Kim sent me to you. Right?\u201d</p> <p>She remembered the sense of relief when she\u2019d seen Kim nod her approval at Sam. She\u2019d figured Kim knew something she didn\u2019t. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t see me as a slave.\u201d The realization had been overwhelming. He\u2019d seen a person, not an animal. After checking her restraints, he\u2019d looked into her eyes. \u201cYou still with me here, Linda?\u201d He\u2019d even used her name.</p><p>\u201cYou trusted me, no matter how little.\u201d He continued playing with her hair. \u201cBut you were scared, and then I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFight-or-flight revs up the nerves. So does pain. Means you felt more than normal. So after I\u2019d whipped you, you were loaded with endorphins and in subspace. Turned your head right off.\u201d He cupped her face. \u201cBaby, once you gave me your trust, you were a peach ready to be plucked, and there was nothing you could do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The explanation helped. \u201cI still shouldn\u2019t have...\u201d She still felt guilty for coming. Felt dirty.</p><p>\u201cDo your eyes tear up when you peel an onion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d What the heck? \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your nerves reacting to chemicals. If you tell yourself not to cry when peeling onions, does that work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. Nerves and chemicals. A person couldn\u2019t control those. She hadn\u2019t had a chance. The guilt of that orgasm wafted away along with the last of her anger at his actions.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d As he rubbed his cheek against hers, the rough stubble scraped her skin and sent a shiver through her. \u201cBut enough warnings. You think about anything but here and now, I\u2019ll spank you.\u201d</p><p>His bare hand would slap her bottom. He\u2019d hurt her and... A shiver of need ran up her spine.</p><p>He laughed, actually laughed. \u201cWhy wait?\u201d He rose. Grasping her around the waist, he pulled her out of the covers and bent her over the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d Her face against the quilt muffled the words.</p><p>\u201cGood. You remember my name.\u201d His hand gripped her nape, holding her down as he lifted her gown. Cool air washed over her skin. He rubbed her cheeks, massaged them. Touching her. \u201cYou have a beautiful ass. Just right.\u201d</p><p>With the first light spanks, blood felt as if it detoured from her heart straight to her clit.</p><p>He hit harder. Stinging increased into pain, and then he started to seriously spank her. Hard and even. Slap, slap, slap. It hurt. Tears filled her eyes, and her fingers fisted in the quilt. And then, within one breath and another, the magic happened. As each smack flowed inward, it transformed into glittering pleasure.</p><p>He stopped to rub her skin. The joy of his touch sheeted through her, deeper even than the throbbing of her bottom. As his fingers explored the wetness on her inner thighs, he growled in approval, erasing the ugly guilt inside her before it took hold.</p><p>Tortuously, he traced a finger over her labia and up to circle her clit, sending a burst of need through her.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she whispered, trying to stand.</p><p>\u201cNo, missy. You don\u2019t run from pain...or desire.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing sped up. He didn\u2019t stop. Holding her in place, he continued touching her so very intimately. When he rolled her clit between his fingers, her whole body shook as the sensation blasted outward, burning past the last barrier. She moaned into the bedding.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good girl.\u201d His finger swirled her entrance before rubbing each side of her swollen nub and around the top in an inflexible, relentless pattern: side, side, top, side, side, top, until each sensitized part anticipated his touch. Pressure grew inside her as with every new cycle, he pressed harder, longer.</p><p>Her bottom arched up; her legs trembled. More. More. Don\u2019t stop.</p><p>He paused, his fingertip resting right on the very top of her clit.</p><p>Her breathing stopped, everything stopped, frozen right there at the edge. A high whine escaped.</p><p>His fingers tightened on her nape as if to remind her of his hold and to induce the rush of knowing she had no control. Then his finger moved: side, side, and on the top of her clit, it remained, hard and fast and merciless, rubbing over and over.</p><p>Everything inside her coalesced for one unending heartbeat...and the ball of sensation ignited. Brilliant pleasure seared outward through every cell in her body. Oh God...</p><p>Her hips were bucking, her fingernails tingling, and dear heavens, he started spanking her again, harder and faster. Another orgasm hit right on the tails of the first, plummeting her back into the joyous maelstrom.</p><p>Every slap on her bottom felt amazing, a flaring splendor. His powerful hand held her pinned, making her take everything he did.</p><p>Then he slid his hand between her legs and pushed two fingers up inside her.</p><p>Inside. They had\u2014they had\u2014 Panic ripped through her, and she struggled.</p><p>\u201cLinda.\u201d He pulled out, and his hand hit her bottom. Hard. The fiery blast shook her body. \u201cSay my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-Sam.\u201d Sam. Clenching the blankets, she gasped and found the world held air.</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d His fingers entered her again, sliding easily. Shivers ran through her at his determined assault...and the swelling pleasure. As he set up a merciless rhythm, arousal spiraled up in her again.</p><p>He pulled out long enough to spank her more. As each sharply hot impact resounded deep in her core, her need twined and coiled into a thick ball of pressure. When his fingers thrust inside her again, slamming in so unexpectedly, the searing tension exploded into wave upon wave of sensation.</p><p>Gradually, he slowed, bringing her down, and she could feel how her insides clenched his thick fingers, trying to hold him in.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she muttered and heard him laugh. Her thumping heart began to slow. She rolled her face against the quilt, almost appalled at the wonderful feeling inside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulled out slowly. With her wetness still on his fingers, he rubbed her bottom, making her groan at the exquisite burning. After caressing her nape, he released his hold.</p><p>She missed the warmth of his hand\u2014and the sense of being held captive.</p><p>His rough voice was gentle as he asked, \u201cYou ready for my cock, missy?\u201d He pushed her hair out of her face. \u201cIt will happen. We both know that. But it doesn\u2019t need to be tonight.\u201d</p><p>A cock. The slavers had...

She\u2019d dreamed of him. Her voice was hoarse as she answered. \u201cTonight. Now.\u201d Maybe she could even return to him some of the bliss he\u2019d given her.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>She started to rise and was flattened by a hand between her shoulder blades.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I like you there.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach tightened, and a shiver raced through her. Anticipation. Fear. Her eyes closed; her body tensed. She heard his belt buckle. A sliding sound. A zipper. The condom wrapper.</p><p>She tensed, waiting for him to push against her pussy to\u2014 Something smacked her bottom in a shocking eruption of pain.</p><p>\u201cAaaah!\u201d That hurt like nothing she\u2019d felt before. His hand flattened on her midback, shoving her into the mattress as he hit her again with...with his folded-over belt.</p><p>Leather hurt much more. More, more, more. The sharpness bit at her, wrapped around her, digging in with thickening tentacles of pleasure. As he continued, her brain went hazy and the bed dissolved beneath her, leaving her falling through the air. The blows slid right into a growing joy, and she wanted him to continue forever.</p><p>And then he pressed his cock against her, slid inside her. Filled her. The glorious stretching expanded outward from her core, even as the burning still sizzled on her skin, until she didn\u2019t know which feeling was which.</p> <p>He was a solid, intimate presence inside her, keeping her centered as he drove into her, over and over.</p><p>The fog receded as his relentless strokes wakened her until she pushed back against each thrust, needing more.</p><p>His guttural laugh was as arousingly effective as the fingers he slid over her clit. Her entire lower half clenched as he teased her, hammered her, and drove her to the pinnacle.</p><p>There she balanced until each tiny movement felt like the ultimate of sensation. Everything inside her tightened. Her breathing stopped.</p><p>Then he seized hold of her burning, abused ass cheek, gripping hard. The searing blast shot inward, igniting her release\u2014shoving her right off the cliff. \u201cAh, ah, ahhh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat a girl.\u201d With both hands, he gripped her hips, pounding into her, then pressing deep. Deep. Over the roaring of her pulse, she heard his rough, rumbling groan of satisfaction.</p><p>As her heart battered her ribs into mush and she gasped for air, she felt an unfamiliar peace touch her soul. I made him happy. His body was heavy, flattening her on the bed...and she wouldn\u2019t have moved for the world.</p><p>Eventually, he lifted up. When he ran his hand down her back and over her raw bottom, tingles sparked fitfully across her skin. \u201cI\u2019m pulling out, baby. Stay there.\u201d</p> <p>He emptied her, leaving her limp and drained, and she\u2019d have slid off the bed if he hadn\u2019t hoisted her higher on it. She heard his footsteps go, then return.</p><p>Without asking, he stripped her nightgown completely off, then took a place on the bed and pulled her into his arms.</p><p>His skin was slightly damp, and she rested her sweat-streaked cheek on his chest. \u201cI had an orgasm,\u201d she said, her head still hazy.</p><p>\u201cSeveral.\u201d With her ear against his chest, his laugh sounded like thunder in the distance.</p><p>The smell of sex in the room made her want to hide, yet Sam\u2019s scent was there. Not leather tonight, but hay and grass and the outdoors. And soap.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t use cologne or aftershave?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause as if he tried to follow her train of thought. Then he huffed a laugh. \u201cSoap works well enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d With each breath, she felt as if she inhaled strength, and so she filled her lungs completely to get it all in.</p><p>SAM LISTENED TO Linda\u2019s breathing slow as she drifted into sleep. He stayed awake, simply enjoying the feel of her body against his, the limpness of a satisfied woman.</p><p>After an hour, her body stiffened, and her tears dampened his chest.</p><p>\u201cLinda?\u201d</p><p>She pushed against him, trying to sit up, but he held her in place. \u201cIf you need to cry, you do it here, girl.\u201d Where I can watch over you.</p><p>A sob broke off. \u201cI don\u2019t... I was feeling fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said your emotions bounce around.\u201d He tensed. Had he caused this? Maybe she hadn\u2019t been ready.</p><p>As his concern grew, her tears continued. But these weren\u2019t the heaving sobs of emotional trauma; she cried almost silently.</p><p>\u201cLinda, tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery-everything feels wrong.\u201d</p><p>After a minute, he realized he\u2019d assumed the upheaval was from the past. But perhaps this was something more common. He tightened his arms around her and kissed the top of her head. \u201cYou know what subdrop is?\u201d</p><p>Her head moved. No.</p><p>\u201cSometimes the endorphins that send you into a good place wear off. Leave you in a hole. Once you know what it feels like, it\u2019s not as bad.\u201d Or so the subs said. \u201cKinda like a kid after a party, buzzed on sugar, missing a nap. Nicole used to work her way into a tantrum and end up crying on my lap. Crashing as everything wore off. You\u2019re crashing, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wonderful. What\u2019s the cure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust this.\u201d He rubbed his hands up and down her back, letting her know she wasn\u2019t alone. That someone was there to watch over her. There wasn\u2019t much else he could do. Dammit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d She patted his shoulder, then took a shuddering breath. \u201cAnd it was worth it. I had an orgasm.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she was going to be fine. He stared up in the darkness, realizing he was smiling at how insufferably pleased she sounded.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Early the next day, behind the store counter, Linda was making lists of new merchandise to buy and possible craftspeople to consider. Two Canadian-sounding customers were browsing the quiet store. She took in their attire of shorts, tanks, and flip-flops. They were definitely from farther north.</p><p>In contrast, Linda wore a long-sleeved shirt and tan slacks. Opal, her clerk, was in an ankle-length denim dress, because\u2014to Floridians\u2014sixty degrees was on the chilly side.</p><p>As Opal dragged a box of tote bags across the floor, her kinky black hair bounced with each tug. She saw Linda watching, and her dark brown eyes brightened. \u201cYou look good today. Happier.\u201d</p><p>I had an orgasm. \u201cI\u2019m starting to settle back in.\u201d Had she looked that unhappy?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. It\u2019s nice to have you back. You\u2019d think it would be good to have the boss gone, but it\u2019s not the same place without you.\u201d</p><p>As the young woman headed for the shelves, Linda felt as if she\u2019d inhaled bubbles and was floating a couple of inches above the chair. The pressure in her chest was gone. That irritable itchy feeling was gone. Like a sandy beach, she\u2019d been scoured clean, the ugly seaweed and junk swept away by the waves.</p><p>But was it only because she\u2019d had an orgasm? Setting her chin in her palm, she doodled on the list. Drew a row of tulips.</p><p>Before she\u2019d been kidnapped, a good night of sex had never resulted in such an uplift the next day. Her pen fashioned a rose...then an outline of Sam\u2019s big hand. Of course, no one\u2014not even Frederick\u2014had given her such amazing climaxes, but what if her mood wasn\u2019t due to sex at all? Hadn\u2019t she felt like this after Sam had flogged her in the Shadowlands? All open and free. Clean.</p><p>She frowned. The pressure inside her had built up again, hadn\u2019t it? She just hadn\u2019t noticed, what with all the other complications in her life.</p><p>But an experienced sadist might have noticed. Had Sam given her that spanking and strapping for more reasons than diverting her mind from the slavers? Her pen dug into the paper, sending jagged lightning toward the flowers. He always watched her so intently. Studied her. A belt took form on the paper and doubled over.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d known. And since he was a Dom down to his bootlaces, he\u2019d given her what he figured she needed.</p><p>He\u2019d been wrong, dammit. I refuse to be a masochist. She bit her lip, wondering if she was the one who was wrong. Maybe she had needed the pain. And possibly for longer than just the past few months. A sinking feeling made her lean against the counter. Possibly for a long, long time.</p><p>But she\u2019d found other methods to handle the feelings. Eating foods spicy enough to make the children complain. Cleaning and doing yard work until her limbs trembled. Working out in the gym so long that every muscle in her body ached like a sore tooth. Her husband had called it \u201chaving a mood on her\u201d and had attributed it to her being female.</p><p>Her lips quirked. A good spanking might have saved her all sorts of effort. But Frederick had never wanted to discuss sex. The few times she\u2019d asked him for something different\u2014a swat, some roughness, to hold her down\u2014he\u2019d been disgusted.</p><p>More customers came in, browsing the basket section. Actually, Frederick had been more than simply disgusted; he\u2019d implied she had a mental problem. Her pen scribbled dark clouds along the edge of the paper. She\u2019d never tried to talk about sex again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But maybe she was mentally unstable. Dismay splattered over her happy mood like a cold rain. She\u2019d told herself the flogging at the Shadowlands would be the last time. Insisted on it. But then she\u2019d let Sam spank her. Whip her with his belt.</p><p>What had she been thinking? A normal person didn\u2019t visit BDSM clubs and definitely didn\u2019t let a man spank her. A little kink was one thing. Needing to be hurt was entirely different.</p><p>This had to stop. She wasn\u2019t going to let herself be a masochist.</p><p>But...what about Sam? She closed her eyes, remembering his hard kiss before he\u2019d left her bed. If she continued to see him, he\u2019d give her the pain she craved, and she\u2019d never be able to stop. Like a drug dealer, he fed her addiction.</p> <p>This must end. No matter how she felt about him, she couldn\u2019t keep sleeping with him. Not tonight. Not ever. The realization, the resolution, hurt something deep inside her.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>Linda pasted on a smile for the young woman. \u201cThat\u2019s a lovely piece.\u201d She rang up the sale of the carved candlestick and managed to chat with the Canadian and her friend.</p><p>As the two women walked out, Linda reached for her cell phone. Her hand shook. Need to do this. Don\u2019t be a coward. She punched in Sam\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cDavies.\u201d His dark, rasping voice sent her hormones bubbling into instant carbonation.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Linda. I\u2019ve been thinking. The graffiti guy seems to have stopped. I don\u2019t think you need to waste your time driving here every day.\u201d Even as she said it, her chest tightened.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saying you don\u2019t want to see me again?\u201d</p><p>The disconcertingly blunt question stabbed through her, and she smothered an instinctive no. He deserved better than a stupid excuse. She was being cowardly. Tangling her fingers in her hair, she yanked. Be honest. \u201cSam, you mean a lot to me. And I really, really appreciate the time you\u2019ve spent, helping me.\u201d Holding me. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, and I\u2019ll always be grateful.\u201d She closed her eyes, pulling in a slow breath. \u201cGod, I feel as if I\u2019ve been using you. I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want...want to do what we did. I can\u2019t be like that. I need to be normal.\u201d Her pen scribbled over the hand she\u2019d drawn, blotting it out, each black line adding a fresh slice of hurt.</p><p>\u201cNormal.\u201d</p><p>Tears blurred her eyes at the disgust in his voice. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, no one is normal. Even the ones who try to appear that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. This is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. All too well.\u201d He paused. \u201cHow about I come over and we talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point.\u201d And he\u2019d look at her with those perceptive blue eyes, say her name, and she\u2019d cave. She would. A vise of guilt squeezed the breath from her. She\u2019d do anything to keep from hurting Sam\u2014anything but continue on the path they were going down.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Ice covered the gravel of his voice. \u201cI think you\u2019re wrong, girl, but you\u2019ll find that out yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Then this is good-b\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMebbe. Doesn\u2019t sound like you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>She did, didn\u2019t she? \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d disconnected. Well. That was that. As she straightened, she looked down at her paper. Black scribbles had blotted out the flowers and the writing. After pulling in a steadying breath, she started a fresh list.</p><p>The afternoon dragged on and on and on. For the first time, she took no joy in her store, in the customers. I want to go home.</p><p>\u201cLinda, sweetheart.\u201d She glanced up to see Lee halfway to the counter, his suit and tie a marked contrast to the casually dressed beachgoers. His sandy hair had been tousled by the wind, and he finger combed it as he grinned at her. The women customers gave him lingering looks.</p><p>Linda forced a smile. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in the area.\u201d Lee leaned over the counter to give her a quick kiss on the cheek. \u201cAre you caught up yet? I want to take you out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re an incredibly difficult woman to date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready for...for anything, Lee.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cI know we were...intimate, but I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. We\u2019ll take it slow. Just dinner. Nothing else.\u201d</p><p>Here was the normal life she wanted. With a nice man. Months ago, when she\u2019d sounded him out about kinky sex, he hadn\u2019t been interested at all, but he hadn\u2019t called her names as Dwayne had. Or implied she was mentally unstable like Frederick.</p><p>If she dated him, he\u2019d keep her on the straight and narrow, and if she had to cope in other ways, she would. Hey, a ton of extra cleaning and exercising wouldn\u2019t be bad. \u201cThen okay. I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at seven.\u201d</p><p>Everything in her wanted to yell no. Let him in her house where memories of Sam would linger? She couldn\u2019t bear that. Not yet. \u201cHow about I meet you at the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>Now would this be considered stalking? Sam frowned. Seemed awfully close to it.</p><p>He\u2019d been on the way to Linda\u2019s house, hoping she\u2019d eased up and they could talk, when he\u2019d spotted her car in a restaurant parking lot.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have turned in. Shouldn\u2019t have stopped. Being a fool, Davies.</p><p>As he followed the hostess across the restaurant, he spotted Linda sitting across from a man wearing a suit and tie. Damn, she was beautiful. She\u2019d done that curling thing with her hair. Wore makeup to make her seal-brown eyes even bigger. Her light pink, silky top showed only a hint of cleavage.</p><p>The hostess moved past Linda and her goddamned date.</p><p>\u201cWait, miss,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>The waitress stopped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sit there.\u201d He pointed to an empty table near the center of the room, a couple of tables from Linda\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe appreciated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d She gave him a flirtatious look. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He ignored the chair she pulled out for him and chose one where he had a satisfying view of his quarry. Acting like a stalker, Davies. But the location was good. He couldn\u2019t hear their conversation, but she\u2019d eventually catch sight of him. And then she would have a chance to see if she really wanted a normal life. A normal man.</p><p>If she was jumping into a relationship to flee from herself, that was just damn stupid. But if she seriously wanted Vanilla Boy, Sam would back off.</p><p>After ordering, he leaned back, sipped coffee, and enjoyed the view. Maybe some fools wouldn\u2019t consider her beautiful, but he thought she was stunning. And natural. After the years of Nancy\u2019s fake giggles and shrill hysterics, he appreciated Linda\u2019s open, full-bodied laughter.</p><p>Pissed him off that other men noticed as well.</p><p>And he resented the hell out of the fact that Vanilla Boy could make her laugh. Sam\u2019s jaw tightened. The man had no trouble keeping a conversation going; his words flowed like a flooding river.</p><p>If she wanted a talkative man, then she didn\u2019t want Sam.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d be happy with that bastard. If so...might as well leave. He lifted his hand for the waitress.</p><p>But Linda didn\u2019t appear sexually interested in the man. When Vanilla Boy reached across the table and took her hand, she displayed no reaction at all. Like she\u2019d closed herself off.</p><p>Sam lowered his hand. She\u2019d definitely reacted to him last night. He\u2019d never felt a connection like that, as if he could smell her emotions as easily as he inhaled her scent. After what she\u2019d been through, the trust she\u2019d shown in him\u2014letting him hold her, spank her, fuck her\u2014had shaken him right to his bones.</p><p>Goddammit. He leaned back and settled in for the duration.</p><p>Eventually Linda\u2019s attention was diverted from the man by a family walking past. She glanced around the room. When her eyes met Sam\u2019s, her mouth dropped open. She stared at him blankly, then tore her gaze away. As she turned all her attention to her date, her jaw muscles were rigid.</p><p>Sam chuckled. She was obviously dying to glare at him but couldn\u2019t because the other guy would ask why.</p><p>Despite her desire to ignore him, her gaze kept flicking in his direction. He understood the feeling; he couldn\u2019t look away from her either. He saw that her cheeks and lips had turned a rose color; her eyes had taken on an added shine. Yeah, she definitely reacted sexually to Sam\u2014as he did to her\u2014as if being in the same room cranked the hormone level higher.</p><p>He tried not to stare at her as he ate his meal. Wasted money, since he might have been eating hay for all he tasted of the food. As he shoved the potatoes to one side, he frowned.</p><p>Was he being a fool? After all, they\u2019d had sex a grand total of once.</p><p>Then again, although he\u2019d dated Nancy a few times, the one time they\u2019d screwed had convinced him to back away. His good sense hadn\u2019t been wrong, but by then it was too late. \u201cI\u2019m on the pill\u201d wasn\u2019t the first of her lies but had the biggest impact. One that left him living in hell for over a decade\u2014except for the bright light of his daughter. He could never regret the gift of Nicole. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So when it came to Linda, could his judgment be relied on? Well, he\u2019d seen her at her worst. Seen her terrified. In pain. Angry with him. Even considering her panic attacks, she was one of the strongest people he knew.</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t wrong about her.</p><p>After he finished eating, he leaned back, idly smacking his napkin against his palm, remembering the auction and how the dragon\u2019s tongue whip had flicked over her white skin. Her flinches, her groans, her arousal. Did she really want to live a life without that intensity? Feeling half-smothered?</p><p>THE RESTAURANT WAS way too hot, Linda thought as she gulped down her ice water. Across the table, Lee elaborated about next week\u2019s hotel conventions with a suggestion she drop off promotional material for the lobby information rack.</p> <p>He was such a nice man. He always asked her opinion before deciding anything. He didn\u2019t try to boss her around. Shouldn\u2019t she be pleased that he treated her as an equal?</p><p>Her gaze flicked back to Sam. He\u2019d dressed up\u2014for him\u2014in black jeans, black boots, a silver-buckled belt, and a burgundy western shirt with black snap pockets and piping. With his legs stretched out and crossed at the ankles, he looked like a man enjoying his coffee after a good meal. His muscled frame, hard face, and dangerous presence won interested looks from every woman in the place. Including her.</p><p>She wrenched her gaze away, managing to focus on Lee until she heard an odd rhythmic sound. What was that?</p><p>Idly watching a waiter clearing a nearby table, Sam was smacking the end of his linen napkin across his palm. Slap, slap, slap. It seemed an innocuous habit, as another man might tap his foot or play with his mustache; only this sounded and looked far too much like what he\u2019d done to her in the dungeon. Or the bedroom.</p><p>Shifting, Linda licked lips that had gone dry, and the movement drew his attention. When his steady blue eyes met hers, she was suddenly, completely aroused.</p> <p>A crease appeared in his cheek, and then he rose and walked out of the restaurant with the powerful saunter that was his alone.</p><p>\u201cLinda?\u201d Lee turned to follow her gaze. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>In the center of an empty corral, Sam helicoptered the bullwhip over his head and reversed. A crack split the air. Not bad. Never letting the whip settle, he threw again and again, working into a good rhythm.</p><p>After warming up, he moved to the target area. He\u2019d needed something to take his mind off the redhead, and nothing required concentration like whip cracking. He had the scars to prove it.</p><p>Today he had spaghetti noodles to destroy. Poles to wrap and pull.</p> <p>Eventually, as a treat to himself, he targeted cans of soda. The trick was to strike evenly enough to split the can in half. He hit the first can, and the spray fountained up. The bottom half of the can remained on the table, still filled with liquid.</p><p>\u201cShow-off.\u201d The voice broke into his concentration.</p><p>With an amused snort, Sam stopped. Coiling the whip, he walked to where Nolan stood with his forearms resting on the top of the fence. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCame to tell you we\u2019re done for the day.\u201d</p><p>Sam studied the beginnings of his new stable. The construction crew had accomplished a fair amount over the past week. \u201cGetting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould have been built a decade ago. That old one\u2019s a fire trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t needed before.\u201d Couldn\u2019t do it until his divorce. He could hardly subject construction workers to his wife\u2019s hysterics or the way she\u2019d have hit them up for drug money.</p><p>Like she\u2019d tried to shake him down for money yesterday. His mouth twisted with the foul taste that speaking to her left behind. He needed to warn Nicole that her mother was back in Tampa. \u201cBut breeding mares expect some amenities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d Nolan looked around. \u201cPlace looks good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d After the farm was safe from Nancy\u2019s destructive tantrums, he\u2019d made much-needed improvements.</p><p>\u201cHeard you did a scene with your buddy from the auction. You seeing her?\u201d</p><p>Damn gossipy submissives. \u201cNo. She wants to be normal. Normal women don\u2019t hang out with sadists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what Cullen said, she\u2019s as much a masochist as you are a sadist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if she can help it.\u201d</p><p>Nolan gave him a glance. \u201cBut she can\u2019t. Any more than Beth could help being submissive, and she sure as hell tried.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded agreement. But people weren\u2019t logical.</p><p>At least Linda had forgiven him. And she had his phone number. Pushing her further would definitely be stalking. But, goddammit, not seeing her was like losing a wisdom tooth and constantly checking the empty socket. \u201cBall\u2019s in her corner.\u201d For now.</p><p>\u201cI see I\u2019ve got some practicing to do,\u201d Linda said. Standing on the front lawn of the church in the early evening sunlight, she smiled at the gray-haired director of the choir.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll catch up quickly.\u201d Mrs. Ritter riffled through a sheaf of sheet music. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed singing.\u201d And practice had been wonderful. But now, as the choir members mingled outside the church, her anxiety was creeping back.</p><p>\u201cI saw the paper with the picture of your house,\u201d Mrs. Ritter said. \u201cHas the creep been back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank goodness.\u201d Not for two weeks now\u2014since the first night Sam had spent in her house, leaving his big truck parked at the curb. Perhaps the spray painter had seen Sam and decided to pursue less perilous canvases.</p><p>Apparently, Sam had decided to pursue less neurotic women. She hadn\u2019t seen him since the restaurant. Ignoring the hollow ache in her chest, she said, \u201cI think the painter got bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s excellent news.\u201d Mrs. Ritter handed over selections of music, then frowned at a small group of women near the refreshments table. Their whispering abruptly stopped.</p><p>Linda stiffened. More gossip. Normal conversations were a low murmur, like background noise. But when people gossiped, their voices would lower and their glances would hit her like cold ocean spray as they checked to ensure she hadn\u2019t noticed and couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to hear. One look at the group told her that the two women in their thirties had ruled her a slut. The two older women weren\u2019t judging.</p><p>I hate this. Even worse, she couldn\u2019t stop wondering if the obscenities on her house were done by someone she knew.</p><p>\u201cThe alto section will improve with you here. They\u2019ve needed a stronger lead.\u201d The woman patted her shoulder. \u201cWelcome back.\u201d</p><p>As Mrs. Ritter moved away, Linda stared after her. People were certainly unpredictable. She\u2019d thought younger women would be the most accepting\u2014and in her neighborhood they had been\u2014but here, the older women were more open-minded. A couple of them in their sixties had even said their book club\u2019s selection last month was a popular BDSM romance. Go figure.</p><p>Really, almost everyone had welcomed her home. Yet somehow the few unfriendly gossips overshadowed the rest. She shook her head ruefully. Years ago she\u2019d discovered Brenna and Charles might forget her compliments, but her critical comments lingered in their minds forever. Apparently, malicious remarks created the same imbalance.</p><p>Linda considered the clusters of people. Join one?</p><p>No, she\u2019d braved enough for one day. Instead, she raised her voice. \u201cI have to run. I\u2019ll see you all in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>To a murmured chorus of farewells, she headed for her car with a sigh of relief. As she reached the street and her knotted muscles loosened, she glanced back. Normal people. Glasses and gray hair, housewives, secretaries, a lawyer, clerks, two businesswomen. Some retired, three in college. Not a monster among them, even though she often felt like Brenna\u2019s hamster the day Charles\u2019s puppy had cornered it.</p><p>Unable to face her too-quiet house, she drove to where the long city dock jutted out into the water. Just before dark, the pier held only an old man fishing. A pelican on a piling watched silently as Linda dropped onto a weathered bench.</p><p>The water was dark and calm. A light ocean breeze teased her hair and fluttered her clothing, blowing away the remnants of ugly gossip until she felt clean again. Her hand trembled when she tucked her hair behind her ear. As the days passed, leaving her house grew more difficult\u2014not from fear of being kidnapped, although that hovered in the background\u2014but from being around people. She felt as if everyone was judging her. Getting paranoid much, honey?</p><p>But worse\u2014much more terrifying\u2014was that she had started to feel distant, as if she\u2019d raised walls and neglected to build doors in them. It was happening again. Her hands clenched as despair whipped around her like an unstoppable wind. It wasn\u2019t supposed to come back. Dammit, it wasn\u2019t supposed to ever come back.</p><p>She wanted that clear, open feeling that came from being with Sam...because he knew how to hurt her.</p><p>Whoever heard of craving a sensation rather than something like, say, chocolate or pizza? Of course, guys often complained if they didn\u2019t\u2014how did one put it?\u2014get their ashes hauled regularly. Marathoners got cranky if they were injured, saying things like I need to run.</p><p>I need pain. She shuddered. No no no.</p><p>A gull swooped past, its beady black eyes assessing her for potential food. \u201cNot this time.\u201d Then again, in her pocket, she had a cookie from the refreshment table at practice. \u201cWell, okay.\u201d She tossed a chunk onto the dock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The gull landed with a light thump and waddled to the goodie. Suddenly, three more of the noisy birds appeared.</p><p>\u201cGood grief.\u201d She tossed each a tidbit and scowled when the smallest gull was shoved aside. Bullies abounded, didn\u2019t they? Her next toss went directly under the little guy.</p><p>Birds and their pecking orders. Humans did the same thing. She sighed. Boy, did they. Okay. Time to think. Logically.</p><p>Basically, she had two, somewhat intertwined, problems going on.</p> <p>The first was that her recent notoriety\u2014being a slave\u2014affected how she fit into life in Foggy Shores. That might eventually resolve, since hopefully, as the townspeople\u2019s memories faded, so would the gossip.</p><p>\u201cDo I want to wait that long?\u201d</p><p>Food finished, one by one, the gulls took to the sky, leaving only the sounds of water lapping at the pilings and the laughter of children playing on the beach. She\u2019d been happy in this town. Her marriage had been a good one for the most part. When Frederick had died so unexpectedly in a car crash, the townspeople had been her support. Had helped her start her business. Here was where she\u2019d raised Brenna and Charles.</p><p>She stared down at her hands. But now... The last of her close friends had moved away two years ago. Stupid mobile society. Her children had gone off to college. She had fewer ties; she could leave. Her home no longer felt like a refuge\u2014she still saw the ugly words as if they\u2019d never been scrubbed away. Her house would easily sell.</p><p>But my store? She loved her little beach store, loved being a businesswoman, loved supporting her fellow craftsmen. She didn\u2019t want to move her business. Her mouth tightened. And she darn well wasn\u2019t going to flee as if she\u2019d done something wrong.</p> <p>So the answer to problem number one? She\u2019d wait it out.</p><p>She scrubbed the toe of her canvas shoe on the rough wood, realizing her second problem affected the first and vice versa. Gossip wouldn\u2019t be so unnerving if she was comfortable with herself.</p><p>Face it, she wasn\u2019t. At all. She closed her eyes and asked the question she\u2019d been avoiding. Did needing to be hurt mean she was mentally unstable?</p><p>I don\u2019t know. She grimaced. It\u2019d be easier to judge if she had more experience. But she\u2019d been a virgin when she married Frederick, and she\u2019d had very few lovers. Before Sam, she\u2019d only mentioned her desires to three men\u2014Dwayne, Frederick, and Lee. They\u2019d all behaved as if she had a problem.</p><p>Then again, they were all...conservative...men. Should she use their opinions to measure herself? Perhaps not. She gave an unhappy laugh. Why hadn\u2019t she spent her time in that one BDSM club talking to people? Finding out what was normal, if there was such a thing.</p><p>As unhappiness welled up inside her, she blinked back tears. Why was it all so hard?</p> <p>But her solution\u2014ignoring her \u201cproblem\u201d\u2014wasn\u2019t working. At all. Somehow she had to find a way to come to terms with herself. I need help. Advice. The tears spilled over. I need a hug so, so much.</p><p>And with that, she had the answer. On her cell phone, she punched in a number. \u201cKim? Can I talk to you about something?\u201d</p><p>Filled with the scent of pizza, garlic, and olive oil, the small Italian restaurant was warm and cozy against the chill night. A cold front was moving in, temperatures were dropping, possibly down to freezing. Orange groves were on alert.</p><p>Linda followed Kim toward a small corner booth with only one occupant, a redhead with a vivid blue streak in her hair. She wore a blue, three-quarter-sleeved shirt to match and had blue-flowered wrist tattoos. Not a stodgy person, at least.</p><p>Kim motioned to her. \u201cThis is Gabi.\u201d</p><p>Linda smiled politely. Apparently the woman had volunteered to work with the FBI as a decoy in the Shadowlands. Successfully, since she\u2019d been kidnapped by the Harvest Association. A snort threatened to escape. Maybe this isn\u2019t the right person to talk to me about insanity.</p><p>Gabi grinned. \u201cHi, Linda.\u201d</p><p>That voice. Mingled with memories of sobbing women, gentle orders from nurses in scrubs, and beeping medical machines was this lovely voice. \u201cYou were at the hospital.\u201d All the rescued slaves from the auction had been taken to one hospital for healing and counseling. Gabi had been with the counselors.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a victim specialist with the FBI and very happy to stay that way.\u201d Gabi gave a mock shiver. \u201cFieldwork is totally not my thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did it for me, and I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d Kim glanced at a single glass on the table. \u201cDid you order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. Two large. One all meat, one pepperoni and black olive. There\u2019ll be plenty to take home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood job. Raoul loves pizza. Linda, sit. I\u2019ll get us some drinks.\u201d She glanced at Gabi\u2019s drink, then at Linda. \u201cRoot beer, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d As Kim headed away, Linda slid into the other side of the booth, feeling less uncomfortable than she\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cI hear you have some questions and want to talk a bit.\u201d</p><p>Where to start? \u201cKim said you live with a Dom? You\u2019re submissive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Marcus is one of the Masters of the Shadowlands. He used to handle the trainees there, which is how we met.\u201d</p><p>At the easy agreement, Linda released the breath she\u2019d been holding. Obviously, she wouldn\u2019t shock this woman. Maybe. \u201cI\u2019m submissive too.\u201d She forced out the next words. \u201cAnd a masochist.\u201d As she stared at the wavering wood of the booth, the buzzing in her ears blotted out the hum of conversation. She felt her hand being taken.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, sweetie, before you pass out.\u201d</p><p>Linda pulled in a breath, and the room came back in focus. Sweat had beaded on her forehead. \u201cUm. Sorry. I hadn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gabi\u2019s smile was sympathetic. \u201cHadn\u2019t said that aloud before? That must feel like one of those alcoholic programs. \u2018My name is Linda, and I\u2019m a masochist.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Yet the word had less impact this time. \u201cKind of. So does being a m-masochist mean I need some serious mental adjustment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see.\u201d Gabi leaned back. \u201cDid being a slave turn you into a masochist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. In fact...\u201d Linda\u2019s hands clenched. But she was already confiding, might as well go all the way. \u201cI saw a woman Tasered outside a BDSM club. I tried to help and ended up kidnapped too.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cOnly, I\u2019d just been in that club. So it feels like I got what I deserved. Like I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, that\u2019s bullshit.\u201d Gabi\u2019s brisk interruption made Linda blink. \u201cDidn\u2019t your counselor tell you that?\u201d</p><p>Linda stared at her hands. \u201cI never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t share that with her, did you?\u201d Gabi narrowed her eyes. \u201cAnd a minute ago, you acted like you\u2019d never said the word \u2018masochist\u2019 before. You didn\u2019t bring that up with her either?\u201d</p><p>Linda shook her head.</p><p>\u201cOh boy. No wonder you\u2019re going around in circles.\u201d Gabi\u2019s brows drew together.</p><p>\u201cGabi, hello?\u201d Kim thumped the drinks on the table and slid in beside Linda. \u201cI wanted you to help, not frown at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell damn, how is a therapist supposed to help if she\u2019s left in the cold?\u201d Gabi let out a long sigh before her lips twisted ruefully. \u201cThen again, we\u2019re also supposed to push and get to the bottom of things. Yours obviously let you avoid a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvoid what?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>\u201cAvoid the things you worked through.\u201d Gabi patted Kim\u2019s hand. \u201cLike how dirty you felt. And how you felt as if you deserved to be abused because you\u2019d gone to a BDSM club.\u201d</p><p>Linda stared. \u201cYou too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim got help with those feelings.\u201d Gabi\u2019s gaze settled on Linda. \u201cSo...you didn\u2019t tell your counselor because you think being into kink is wrong. Right? I mean, correct?\u201d</p><p>Gabi was definitely a psychologist. Linda wanted to hide under the table, yet the understanding from both women kept her in her seat. \u201cMy husband and other...lovers...acted as if I\u2019m unbalanced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Because you like pain. Crave it, probably. It makes sex better and\u2014for some people\u2014helps process their emotions.\u201d Gabi tapped her fingernails on the table. \u201cYou\u2019ve got issues all right. First, the easiest one. You should realize that any assault leaves the victim thinking, \u2018What did I do wrong to cause that? If I\u2019d only done something different, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u2019 A survivor will go over and over every detail leading up to the incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Linda blinked.</p><p>Kim glanced over with a sheepish smile. \u201cOh yeah. Raoul said it\u2019s normal. Humans need to think we can affect fate and control our destiny. Maybe we can to an extent, but sometimes shit just happens.\u201d</p><p>Linda bit her lip. They were right. If she believed being kinky had led to the horrors she\u2019d endured, then by being normal, she\u2019d ensure that bad things wouldn\u2019t ever happen again. But if disasters occurred from simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time, then the universe held no certainties.</p><p>\u201cMakes it scary, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Gabi patted her hand. \u201cI went through a gang rape when I was a teen. I got past it, but the world never felt quite as safe again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabi would have been younger than Brenna. Sadness mingled with pity as Linda turned her hand over and squeezed Gabi\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Gabi squeezed back, not speaking. Letting Linda think.</p><p>After a moment, she pulled in a breath. Sometimes shit just happens. How logical. And freeing. I didn\u2019t do anything bad to warrant being enslaved. Something inside her loosened. Not completely. She\u2019d have to work on believing that. But first, she needed to deal with the real reason she\u2019d come. \u201cAnd the other issue? Wanting pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Let\u2019s go over that.\u201d Gabi rummaged in her purse and pulled out two business cards. \u201cI know counselors are supposed to be all enlightened, but we often have biases. S and M was taken off the mental disorders list. However, it still makes some psychologists uncomfortable.\u201d She handed over the cards. \u201cI can\u2019t take you on as my patient, but these two are kink-friendly. And you need some help, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Linda tucked the cards in her wallet. \u201cS and M isn\u2019t a mental problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh. Just another point in the wide sexual continuum. How you deal with it is what counts.\u201d Gabi leaned back. \u201cDo you constantly need someone to hurt you? Does the craving affect your work or home life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot constantly, but I-I want it. Get cranky without it.\u201d Linda stared at her fingers and admitted, \u201cI got really...needy...after the kidnapping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the rescued women had problems afterward. That\u2019s not crazy. That\u2019s human. And if pain helps you get in touch with your inner self, then stress will increase your need for it.\u201d Gabi grinned. \u201cJust like I\u2019ll eat an entire bag of potato chips when I\u2019m frazzled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The next worry popped out before she could censor it. \u201cBut with sex. The guys thought I was unbalanced when I asked for something...different.\u201d</p><p>Kim flicked her fingers in annoyance. \u201cThe scum suckers didn\u2019t want to hear they\u2019re not gods in the bedroom or that you could possibly want anything other than what they did.\u201d She snickered. \u201cReally, Linda, you should be ashamed, crushing their little egos.\u201d</p><p>Gabi snorted a laugh.</p><p>After a second, Linda\u2019s lips tipped up. That was rather how Frederick and Lee had acted. Insulted. And Dwayne had been seriously angry.</p><p>As if filled with helium, her spirits started to lift. \u201cSo I\u2019m not mentally unbalanced? Don\u2019t need counseling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need counseling, but mainly to help you figure out how to deal with your needs.\u201d Gabi rolled her eyes. \u201cNot to be cured of them.\u201d</p><p>Not crazy. Linda bit her lip, fighting back tears. She still had to choose whether or not to have BDSM in her life, but now the decision would be hers. Not one made from fear.</p><p>I\u2019m not crazy. Maybe she should order champagne to go with the pizza.</p><p>Kim nudged her shoulder. \u201cAfter we eat\u2014and gossip for a while\u2014you want to visit the Shadowlands?\u201d</p><p>A thrill shot through her. Would Sam be there? Did she want to see him? Duh. Considering how his mere name made her insides quiver, that was a stupid question.</p><p>But should she see him? She still wasn\u2019t real comfortable with the idea of needing pain. But as Gabi said, if that was who she was, then she had to learn to deal with it. Stop trying to hide her head in the sand.</p><p>But I like sand. Still, avoidance hadn\u2019t done her any favors, now had it?</p><p>And yet, would Sam forgive her for how she\u2019d run from him? There was only one way to find out. \u201cYes. Let\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Dressed in black jeans and a black work shirt, Sam leaned against the bar and scowled at Z. \u201cYou got something you need me for?\u201d He hadn\u2019t planned on visiting the Shadowlands. Not this weekend. Not until he could forget the last person under his lash and could stop seeing her everywhere.</p> <p>Z hadn\u2019t said what he wanted, so Sam had brought in his bag. But he wasn\u2019t in the mood to do a teaching scene or whatever Z had in mind\u2014not if he could escape it.</p><p>\u201cSomehow, you\u2019ve managed to evade your turn at supervising the trainees.\u201d Z gave him a faint smile. \u201cThis is Olivia\u2019s rotation, but her job schedule changed. Can you take her place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d He\u2019d rather do a goddamned teaching scene. Sam\u2019s gaze took in the trainees who were flitting about the room. They were easy enough to spot, since they wore leather wrist cuffs decorated with colored ribbons, indicating their scene preferences. Red meant they were masochists. \u201cI\u2019d hoped you\u2019d overlooked me. Or assigned someone permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance,\u201d Z said in a dry voice. \u201cAnd I think the trainees benefit from having a variety of trainers. Their choice of a Dom might be more balanced.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d escape the chore. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t mind working with the trainees one-on-one, but as trainer, he\u2019d also have to supervise, assign, punish, and set them up with either Doms or Masters who could widen their experiences. He frowned, considering the potential Tops. Not a good selection. Too many Masters didn\u2019t scene with anyone but their submissives. \u201cWe need more single Masters, Z.\u201d</p><p>Z nodded. \u201cI agree. Suggestions?\u201d</p><p>The title of Shadowlands Master\u2014or Mistress\u2014was bestowed by the membership during a voting process; however, Z nominated the candidates. \u201cI think Holt might be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would work out well. Galen Kouros and Vance Buchanan are members now, and they\u2019re undoubtedly at Master status.\u201d Z considered. \u201cWhat do you think of Jacob?\u201d</p><p>Sam frowned. \u201cThought he was in a relationship with Heather.\u201d Heather had been a trainee at one time.</p><p>\u201cTheir attachment didn\u2019t survive her acceptance of a job in Oregon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess that happens.\u201d A shame though. They\u2019d looked good together.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. He\u2019s back and helping out as a DM.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d make a good Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s four. And Catherine is ready for a Mistress title.\u201d Z studied Sam. \u201cYou look tired.\u201d</p><p>Damn psychologist-Dom. Sam had grown exceedingly tired of therapists after his discharge and later with Nancy. Not that they\u2019d done his addicted wife any good. Of course, she was the most manipulative person he\u2019d ever met. \u201cI love you, Sam. If you loved me, you\u2019d give me what I need.\u201d His jaw set. Then he pushed the memories aside. \u201cEarly day. Nolan\u2019s crew starts at dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHadn\u2019t you told me you always rise before dawn?\u201d Z said with not a flicker of a changed expression.</p><p>Well, Sam wasn\u2019t much for evasions. Bluntness served him better. \u201cNot your problem, Z. Leave off.\u201d</p><p>Z paused, then nodded. \u201cCall me if I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Sam slapped the bar. \u201cI\u2019ll go terrify the trainees so I can sleep well tonight.\u201d</p><p>Z\u2019s grin flashed. \u201cConsidering Anne supervised them last month, scaring them will take some work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d Mistress Anne was not only a sadist, but she had mind fucking down pat. Where Sam was straightforward, she was damned sneaky. And yet her male submissives\u2014and she usually had more than one\u2014worshipped the ground she walked on. Shaking his head, Sam moved down the bar to where Cullen was drawing a beer.</p><p>Cullen looked up with a grin. \u201cHey, buddy. Did Z drop the trainees in your lap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Who are the first-shift barmaids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRainie, Dara, and Sally. Maxie\u2019s gone for a month or so. Uzuri and Tanner will take the last half of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Sam strolled through the big room, automatically monitoring the scenes. When he spotted a male Dom preparing to take his sub bareback, Sam cleared his throat and nodded at the stand with condoms. Z didn\u2019t care how long a couple had been together; everybody suited up in the Shadowlands.</p><p>The Dom gave him a rueful look, then said to his partner, \u201cGotta dress for the party, boy. You stay right here.\u201d He gave the sub\u2019s balls a hard squeeze. \u201cHear me? Don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Sam walked away, grinning at the sub\u2019s groan that started low and ended high. Nice range.</p><p>In the main room, he checked on Dara and Sally. They were doing well, not only keeping up with drink orders but also experienced enough to negotiate scenes for when they went off duty. Z deliberately made the trainees serve drinks. Some of them\u2014well, not Dara or Sally\u2014were shy, and barmaiding made it easy for them to meet the Doms.</p><p>In the dungeon room, a Domme was talking to Rainie. Pushing. The Domme wasn\u2019t...completely...out of line, but the trainee was too intimidated to give a firm no.</p><p>About five feet seven, Rainie probably weighed over two hundred pounds, and the younger Doms called her a BBW\u2014a big, beautiful woman\u2014which Sam considered a good description. A fairly new trainee, she was extremely popular.</p><p>She was dressed in blue boy shorts, a latex bra, and a wealth of tattoos. The red lotus flowers started at her ass and turned to blue water fountaining up her spine. More flower tats vined over her right shoulder, down her sternum to curl under her right breast. Her shoulder-length brown hair was highlighted with red and blonde streaks.</p><p>The trainee had a personality as colorful as her appearance.

Read the body language. And you need to give them space to say if they don\u2019t want what you\u2019re offering.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit.\u201d Whitney scowled. \u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d looked instead of pursuing, you\u2019d have caught it,\u201d Sam said. \u201cHow close was she to you? Did she back away? Was she leaning forward or turning her side to you? Flirting with her hair or face...or crossing her arms defensively.\u201d</p><p>The Domme looked as if she\u2019d like to put her fist through the wall. \u201cFuck, fuck, fuck. I really fucked it up.\u201d Tall and slender, she kept her black hair shorter than Sam\u2019s, and her delicate features concealed a mind as tough as her body. She\u2019d make a fine Domme with a tad more experience.</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d Every Dominant in the world screwed up. The good ones admitted their mistakes and learned from them. \u201cYou\u2019ll be more careful next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, and I\u2019ll apologize to the girl.\u201d She slapped his shoulder\u2014one of the few people in the place who dared touch him. \u201cThanks for breaking in.\u201d</p> <p>After nodding, he headed back to the bar to give Rainie a different lecture. Submissives, especially trainees, needed to be able to say no.</p><p>He snagged her as she walked toward the front of the room, having obviously traded places with Dara. Well, Dara definitely knew how to say no. \u201cRainie.\u201d</p><p>Her hazel eyes widened, and she took a step back. Hands in front. Clenched already. \u201cYes, Master Sam.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. Sometimes he enjoyed his \u201ceat babies for breakfast\u201d reputation, but sometimes it got old. Eventually the girl would discover that sadists tended to be politer than regular Doms\u2014at least, when not in a scene. After all, if a sadist was nasty, then how would he get anyone to play with him? \u201cDid you want a session with Whitney?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSay it aloud, girl. Did you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Might as well use his damned scary rep. If she could say no to him, she should be able to say it to anyone. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you, missy,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Still a whisper.</p><p>Her wrist cuff included a yellow ribbon to show she liked mild pain. \u201cBend over the bar stool.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, but after a second she obeyed.</p><p>When he forcefully slapped her boy-shorts-covered ass, she squeaked. He said, \u201cStand up.\u201d</p><p>Her face was red, more from embarrassment than from being hurt.</p><p>\u201cDid you want to scene with the Domme?\u201d</p> <p>Her bottom lip quivered. \u201cNo.\u201d Still too faint.</p><p>\u201cUntil I hear a loud no from you, I\u2019ll continue.\u201d He gave her a heartless look. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time I spanked someone for hours.\u201d</p><p>She gulped when he pointed to the stool, but bent obediently.</p><p>He delivered a swat hard enough to sting his palm, hard enough to make her yelp. When she stood, he asked, \u201cDid you want to scene with the Domme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Nice and loud. \u201cRepeat that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to spank you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He looked upward. \u201cDid the ceiling fall because you said no to a Dom?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, and her mouth dropped open. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me the point of this lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have told her no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Next time, say no with enough assertiveness that a Dom doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re saying yes.\u201d Sam tapped her cheek with his finger, pleased she didn\u2019t shy away. \u201cDo better or next time I\u2019ll use a cane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d She took a step away, then another. \u201cThank you, Sir, for the lesson.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest as she hurried away. She got halfway across the room before she reached around to rub her ass. He grinned.</p><p>WEARING A HALTER top and a short wraparound skirt, Linda sat between Gabi and Kim, watching Sam. As he\u2019d delivered a hard swat to a tattooed submissive, she\u2019d realized everything about the Dom was sexy\u2014his severe expression, harsh face, square chin, corded wrists, lean muscles. Black tough-guy clothes, a big black belt, and boots. All that darkness made his ash-gray hair and pale eyes seem eerie. When he crossed his arms over his chest and watched the young woman flee, Linda gave a little sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Kim eyed her and popped a tiny quiche in her mouth.</p><p>Just lusting after a man. Linda cleared her throat and went for a diversion. \u201cHave you ever noticed what a guy\u2019s posture and demeanor say about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Linda looked around, then nodded at the giant, craggy-faced bartender. \u201cHe moves like he\u2019d not only fight hard, but he\u2019d enjoy the heck out of it. A brawler.\u201d</p><p>Gabi snorted. \u201cYou got Master Cullen down. What about that one?\u201d She nodded at a brutal-looking, darker Dom with a scarred face.</p><p>Linda studied him. No expression, but his eyes never stopped moving, and he stood as if... \u201cGet in his way, and he\u2019d flatten you without thinking twice. Then he\u2019d step over your body without looking back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, you got Master Nolan figured out too.\u201d Kim grinned.</p><p>\u201cWorking as a shopkeeper, you learn to read people quickly.\u201d</p><p>Gabi gave her a sly smile. \u201cWhat about Master Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met him, so it\u2019d be cheating.\u201d Her lips curved up. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t start a fight, wouldn\u2019t enjoy it, but wouldn\u2019t back down either. And he\u2019d definitely finish the job.\u201d</p><p>Kim nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019d kick the guy, just to enjoy hearing him groan,\u201d Linda added.</p><p>Gabi choked on her drink, coughing hard enough to attract attention.</p><p>\u201cWay to go, dummy. Cullen saw us,\u201d Kim hissed.</p><p>Gabi held up her hand, managed a breath, then wheezed, \u201cOh, please, as if Ben wouldn\u2019t have already called your Master? Didn\u2019t you tell Raoul we might visit the Shadowlands?\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cBut...but Ben didn\u2019t tell on us before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the last time we sneaked in, the guys undoubtedly had a chat with him.\u201d Gabi assumed a smug expression. \u201cWhich is why I asked permission.\u201d</p><p>Linda frowned, trying to catch up. Wasn\u2019t Ben the oversize security guard in the entry? \u201cYou\u2019re going to get in trouble? Just for being here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Kim glared at her friend. \u201cYou little brat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you guys. I heard you might come by.\u201d A short, buxom blonde with sea-green eyes dropped into a chair before smiling across the table. \u201cYou must be Linda. I\u2019m Jessica.\u201d After swiping one of Gabi\u2019s pizza rolls, she popped the tidbit in her mouth. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave some more,\u201d Gabi said and pushed the plate over.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d Jessica\u2019s mouth turned down. \u201cZ said when I wander around, I\u2019ve been forgetting who I belong to.\u201d She patted her dark green corset. \u201cHe said he\u2019d make sure I feel as if he\u2019s always got his arm around me...and pulled the strings so tight I can barely breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a new one.\u201d Kim looked worried. \u201cHopefully he won\u2019t share that trick with Raoul.\u201d</p><p>Belong to? Linda spotted the engagement ring on Jessica\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re engaged to Master Z?\u201d Are you insane?</p><p>Jessica laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s not as scary in daily life.\u201d After a second, she amended, \u201cWell, sometimes he\u2019s scarier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know we might come here?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d Jessica squinted in thought. \u201cGabi called Marcus. When Marcus called Dan about some serial rapist, he mentioned Gabi\u2019s plans. Dan told Kari, and Kari told me, and I told Z.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrown it. Raoul\u2019s probably heard the news from at least three people.\u201d Kim tipped back her head to stare at the ceiling. \u201cI am doomed.\u201d</p><p>Linda bit her lip, guilt dropping onto her shoulders. \u201cWill you really get in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I move fast. Time for preventative action.\u201d Kim whipped out her cell phone, turned it on, and hit speed dial. \u201cHey, Master? Gabi and I actually convinced Linda to visit Shadowlands. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d go for it. She\u2019s so stubborn.\u201d She winked at Linda. \u201cBut she agreed, so we\u2019re here, and I wanted to make sure you knew.\u201d</p><p>Through the phone, Raoul\u2019s voice was deep and smooth, although Linda couldn\u2019t make out what he was saying.</p><p>Kim winced. \u201cWell, yes, we did plan to ask her if\u2014\u201d Pause. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think\u2014\u201d Pause. \u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d Pause. Kim\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d She turned the phone off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead meat, girlfriend.\u201d Jessica shook her head with a suppressed giggle. \u201cWhat\u2019s he going to do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know, but he sure wasn\u2019t pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Linda said. \u201cMaybe I can talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it would have happened sooner or later.\u201d Kim shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re still kind of...defining...how much control he gets. He gives in on some things, me on others. But I got the feeling that being here without him isn\u2019t something he\u2019ll negotiate about, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s incredibly possessive of you, so having you loose in a club full of hungry Doms?\u201d Jessica snickered. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not going to win.\u201d</p><p>Linda glanced at Gabi to see if she agreed, but the counselor\u2019s attention was elsewhere. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m just watching...\u201d She pointed.</p><p>As Linda looked, her stomach got a weird \u201cbottom dropping out\u201d sensation. Near the bar, Sam had his hand curled around a black submissive\u2019s nape.</p><p>Linda clenched her jaw against the nasty shot of jealousy. He\u2019s not mine. I turned him away. Rationalization didn\u2019t help. Darn the man. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do a scene with her?\u201d</p><p>Jessica shook her head. \u201cNo way. Uzuri doesn\u2019t even like light pain. No, I bet he arranged a scene for her.\u201d</p><p>Gabi looked over. \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Z gave him the trainees tonight. Said Sam had avoided supervising them for long enough.\u201d She grinned. \u201cProbably pissed that sadist off a bit, huh?\u201d</p><p>Linda couldn\u2019t take her gaze from Sam. How many men would be comfortable guiding a woman by his grip on her neck? But he didn\u2019t look puffed up. Wasn\u2019t strutting. When they stopped, he kept a hand on her shoulder as he talked to a Dom in his thirties. He spoke to Uzuri, then the Dom again, for all the world as if he was arbitrating. When the Dom and Uzuri started conversing, Sam nodded and walked away.</p><p>In the movies, cowboys had a rolling gait, soldiers a predatory one. Sam\u2019s stride was somewhere between the two, like an ominous saunter.</p><p>What would happen when he noticed her? Her muscles tensed in anticipation. As her fingernails dug into her arm, the sting added to the sizzle under her skin, and she realized what she was doing. The perversion of pain. Her mouth tightened.</p><p>Gabi\u2019s gaze met hers. \u201cLinda, if it\u2019s wrong to enjoy pain, does that mean I\u2019m not supposed to like being tied up? Because I really do.\u201d Gabi gave her a smile of understanding.</p><p>Linda relaxed. Gabi was just as sweet as Kim was. And wasn\u2019t it odd that they both seemed so normal? A therapist. A biologist. \u201cWhat do you do for a living, Jessica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re new, aren\u2019t you? Bet you\u2019re suffering from the \u2018ordinary people don\u2019t play like this syndrome.\u201d Jessica\u2019s eyes lit with laughter. \u201cTry this on for size. I\u2019m an accountant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Can\u2019t get stodgier.\u201d Considering, Jessica tapped her lips. \u201cKari\u2019s a schoolteacher; Andrea owns a cleaning business, Beth a landscaping biz. Sally\u2019s getting her master\u2019s degree, Uzuri over there is an executive in a department store, and Rainie manages a tow-truck chain.\u201d</p><p>Linda leaned back in disbelief. Regular jobs; regular people. And why not? Why should she think they\u2019d be odd? She pulled in a breath, feeling like an idiot. How many times had she unthinkingly accepted her father\u2019s narrow-minded opinions as truth\u2014in this case, that anyone wanting more than the missionary position must be creepy? \u201cThank you. That helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, we\u2019ve all been at that place,\u201d Jessica said.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh, Linda.\u201d Gabi waggled her eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019ve been spotted by the man, Ms. Shopkeeper. Are you going to run?\u201d</p><p>Even though her stomach suddenly felt as if she\u2019d swallowed every butterfly in Florida, Linda assumed a haughty expression...and carefully didn\u2019t look around. \u201cYou children might run, but I\u2019m too mature to give in to fear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of bullshit.\u201d Kim glanced over her shoulder. \u201cYep, the sadist has his eyes on you.\u201d She shivered. \u201cSorry, but he still scares me a little.\u201d</p><p>Like a hot spotlight centered upon her, his attention made her insides quiver. Breathe. Look dignified. Relax. When she unclenched her fingers, they were gooey\u2014she\u2019d totally squashed the pizza roll she\u2019d picked up. With a huffed laugh, she wiped off her fingers. Way to look indifferent, dummy.</p><p>A glance at the others revealed Kim trying to smother her laughter and Gabi smiling encouragement.</p><p>Jessica gave her a covert thumbs-up. \u201cStay strong and make him work for it.\u201d</p><p>Why did she feel as if she\u2019d dived off a mile-high cliff and was about to hit the water? With a final gulp of air, Linda turned her head.</p><p>Ice-blue eyes trapped her gaze. She realized she\u2019d risen to her feet. Heavens, how does he do that? Even from a distance, she could see how suppressed laughter made his mouth quirk. He curved his index finger. Come here.</p><p>Well, this was what she wanted, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>It\u2019s just a test. To see what was what. Maybe.</p><p>But as she walked up to him, the warmth in his gaze made her feel...beautiful.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Was she not the most beautiful woman in the club? Resting his hip on a bar stool, Sam watched Linda approach. Her brown eyes were wide, nervous, but not terrified. Her lower lip was caught between her teeth. He held out his hand, pleased when she didn\u2019t hesitate to give him hers. Soft skin, small bones. \u201cWhy are you here, girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I...\u201d Her chin firmed. \u201cI\u2019m trying to decide if being...different...has a place in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent.\u201d Pissed him off the way she saw being unique as being wrong. \u201cAre you talking about being a masochist? Or being a singer? Or a submissive? Or smarter than most? Or maybe being talented at basketry?\u201d</p><p>Her spine straightened. \u201cIt\u2019s not a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201d He curved his hand firmly around her nape as he\u2019d done with Uzuri. Linda instinctively tried to take a step back. When his grip tightened, halting her, he enjoyed the hell out of the way she shivered.</p><p>Then he watched as she didn\u2019t move, yet silently, internally fought his control.</p><p>And he watched as she surrendered. To him.</p><p>When he leaned down and took her lips, not permitting her to withdraw, her mouth softened and opened.</p><p>My Linda. He pulled her between his legs and molded her so tightly against him that her full breasts flattened against his chest. Amazing how different one woman could feel from another. Why the hell did they all want to be alike? \u201cCut out all the different parts of yourself, and your personality will have the texture of mashed potatoes.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, then burst out laughing.</p><p>Damn, he liked her laugh. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...aren\u2019t you a meat and potatoes sort of guy?\u201d</p><p>Had him there. When she rubbed her forehead on his shoulder, he remembered how sweetly she\u2019d snuggled against him in the night. She was a person who liked to touch.</p><p>She looked up at him, her eyes serious. \u201cMy dad was a fire-and-brimstone preacher, and my husband old-fashioned. My town is small and conservative. This isn\u2019t easy for me, but I\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough.\u201d He put his hand under her chin, feeling the softness of her flesh. Older, not tight and hard, and she was so goddamned appealing she could break his heart. He didn\u2019t require some eighteen-year-old to make his cock hard. He wanted a woman, one with lines in her face that said she\u2019d done some living and had learned to cry. And to laugh.</p><p>A tiny trembling ran through her when she met his gaze, and the chemistry between them blazed up like dry wood in a wind. \u201cRemember the safe word here?\u201d</p><p>Her tongue touched her pink lips. \u201cRed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He ran his finger across her lower lip, circling her mouth with the wetness. \u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t wear a mask, girl. I like to see more than your body. Don\u2019t wear one again.\u201d</p><p>A tremor ran through her, and a glint of fear showed in her eyes before she whispered, \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Her trust sent warmth through him. \u201cGood girl.\u201d So what area was available for a scene? Releasing Linda from his arms, he checked. The stocks were free or...the picture frame was empty. \u201cCullen.\u201d</p><p>The bartender looked over.</p><p>\u201cCan you grab my bag?\u201d</p><p>Cullen set a bottled mineral water in front of a Domme, then reached under the bar and brought out Sam\u2019s leather toy bag. \u201cHave fun, you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Sam took a grip on Linda\u2019s nape again. \u201cCome along, girl.\u201d As the heavy silk of her hair flowed over his fingers, he caught her clean lavender-and-tangy-citrus scent. Made him want to pick her up and rub her skin over his.</p><p>But he could wait.</p><p>He led her to a wooden structure built like an extra-tall and double-wide door frame. \u201cCullen calls this the picture frame because of the way it displays a submissive.\u201d</p><p>She eyed the chains and bolts studded around the inside of the frame, then glanced back toward the bar. \u201cHe\u2019s not as easygoing as he acts, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast submissive who annoyed him got strapped to the bar.\u201d With a bucket of ice cubes beside her for anyone that wanted to play. He grinned, remembering the sub\u2019s appalled shrieks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced down at his redhead. Might as well give her a few choices in the game\u2014or let her think she was getting some. After setting his bag on a chair, Sam started unzipping the inside dividers. Opened the one for the toys. Clamps, yes. Gags or blindfold? No. Why deprive himself of hearing her screams, of seeing tears in her eyes? That section stayed closed.</p><p>After moving a rectangular tray table beside the chair, he told Linda, \u201cSet out what\u2019s in the bag.\u201d He touched one end of the table. \u201cThe toys you\u2019d most like me to use go here. Work your way to the other end and your least favorite toys. If something is a hard limit, leave it in the bag.\u201d</p><p>A sweet crease of worry appeared between her red-brown brows. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll start at the good end and work your way through to the bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He stepped close enough that her breasts grazed his chest, and she had to tilt her head back to look up at him. \u201cJust lets me know what will bother you and what won\u2019t. I choose what. And when.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He smiled into her vulnerable eyes. \u201cTrust me to know how much you can take, missy. And to push you to that point.\u201d</p><p>Even as the hint of anxiety appeared in her eyes, her nipples contracted to hard points.</p><p>As the beast inside him stirred and raised its head, he stepped back. \u201cGet started.\u201d</p><p>While he worked on attaching chains to the proper bolts, he watched her pick and choose.</p> <p>She put a thick cane midway, a lighter one closer to the good side. The heavy flogger was good; the one with knotted ends went to the bad side. His favorite short snake whip was considered. Put close to the bad end. Moved to the other side. Moved again. Was there anything more appetizing than a submissive\u2019s uncertainty? He\u2019d definitely give her a taste of that whip, no matter where it ended up on the table.</p><p>When she pulled out the coiled six-footer, he said, \u201cNo, baby. There\u2019s not enough space in here to play with that one.\u201d She nodded and dropped it into the bag, coming out with a crop. A Wartenberg wheel. A vampire glove. Finally she finished.</p><p>After setting up the top restraints, Sam adjusted the lower chains so he could spread her legs. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>As she chewed her lower lip, he savored her hesitation, seeing her anticipation of the pain that would eventually take her to the height of pleasure, no matter how much the initial lash stung. His anticipation rose as well, since watching her ride that first bite of pain would give him an equally sized rush.</p><p>When she stood inside the picture frame, he untied her halter top and tossed it onto his bag. He was already hard, but the sight of her full breasts made his cock lengthen to serious discomfort, an interesting type of erotic ache. Pulling her into his arms, he ground his chest against her bare breasts, feeling her nipples contract back into stabbing points.</p><p>Her eyes were wide with nerves, and he could see the golden flecks that lightened the rich brown. Her lips were parted and inviting, so he fisted her hair, tipped her head back, and took her lips, demanding all he wanted from her mouth. At least for now. Damn but he\u2019d missed kissing her and how she gave him everything, holding back nothing.</p> <p>When he lifted his head, her fingers had dug into his back to hold him closer.</p><p>\u201cI like the way you kiss, girl.\u201d His voice came out gruff.</p><p>She pinkened at the compliment. So sweet.</p><p>Time to push that giving nature of hers. He untied the side band of her skirt, tugging hard at the laces to drive home that she would soon be naked, without the most basic of defenses.</p><p>He tossed the skirt on his bag, followed by her panties. After using his boot to push her feet apart, he ran his hand between her legs. Not cruelly, simply a Dom\u2019s inspection that his submissive had kept herself groomed for his enjoyment.</p><p>His fingers met smooth, bare skin, already slick. Nice. Nothing there to cushion a blow. He rubbed his knuckles over her mound. \u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>Although she was aroused and wet, her muscles tensed and her gaze dropped.</p><p>Gently, Davies. She\u2019d been traumatized. Brutalized. Made into an object. He had to ride a path between dominance and abuse, and in her case, it was a goddamned narrow trail. So he enfolded her in his arms for a comforting hug and a reminder. \u201cYour safe word is red. Do you remember?\u201d</p> <p>Her muscles relaxed, and she nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He rubbed his chin on her smooth hair. \u201cIf I ask you how you\u2019re doing, green means keep going. Yellow means slow down, or that you can\u2019t take whatever I\u2019m using on you at the time.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>He might also ask her who he was so she\u2019d remember she wasn\u2019t with the bad guys. And hell, he simply liked the way she said his name as if he was goddamned John Wayne.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d After fastening padded Velcro cuffs on her wrists, he snapped them to the overhead chains. The ankle cuffs and chains spread her legs wide apart. Then he tightened the arm restraints until her body was stretched nice and taut. Didn\u2019t want her to wiggle and spoil his aim. A shame he couldn\u2019t use his favorite single-tail, but Z rarely cordoned off space for the longer bullwhips.</p><p>Smiling into Linda\u2019s eyes, Sam flattened his hand over her exposed pussy, enjoying her startled response. Enjoying the increasing slickness coating his palm. \u201cI\u2019ve only given you pleasure here before. Tonight your pussy will get a sample of pain as well.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed so hard that he could hear the gulp.</p><p>Yep, this was going to be fun. As he kissed her, plunging his tongue deep, he cupped her ass with one hand and used his other hand to push his finger into her hot, wet cunt. Using the ball of his hand, he ground down on her clit as he thrust in and out. His tongue kept pace, driving her arousal higher. He could almost hear her endorphins start to dance.</p><p>He abandoned her pussy to rub her back firmly, letting the abrasiveness of his calloused palms rouse her tender skin. Another kiss and one more, simply for his enjoyment.</p><p>When he stepped back, her eyes held the gleam of a nicely aroused submissive.</p><p>After pulling the table of toys closer, he picked up a soft, wide-lashed flogger from the \u201cgood\u201d side. Although a determined Dom could snap any flogger hard enough to hurt, this one was designed to be sensuous rather than painful. And he\u2019d use it in that way. As he brushed the strands over her body, he studied the dark contrast of leather against her fair skin, the way her stomach muscles shivered, how her ass cheeks tried to draw away. Her pointing nipples grew tighter when he danced the tails over them.</p><p>Her breasts got a quick flick of the lash tips with enough of a sting to demonstrate he wasn\u2019t putting any part of her off limits this time.</p><p>Her gasp of shock was a hint of how much fun she\u2019d give him tonight.</p><p>Working her up, he took the time to spank her gently, teasing her clit between each set of five, slapping lightly over her shoulders and thighs before returning to pinken her ass further. Her soft, dimpled ass. A squeeze made her hiss. Made him grin.</p><p>\u201cGive me a color.\u201d Not as if he needed one. Her lips were open and rosy with excitement, eyes still clear. But they both needed to know she could speak.</p><p>\u201cGreen. I\u2019m green.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cActually, girl, you\u2019re pink.\u201d Leaning into her body, he ran his hands up her arms to check the tightness of her cuffs. Checked her ankle cuffs as he stepped back. All good. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to turn your skin red.\u201d</p><p>The way her ass wiggled said she liked that.</p><p>This time he used a heavier flogger. Rotating his wrist, creating a figure eight, he slapped the falls up and down her outer thighs, ass cheeks, and upper back. A nice warm-up. Occasionally, he went lighter to sensitize her thighs, her stomach, and below her breasts, bringing the blood to the surface.</p><p>When he stopped, her eyes were fixed on him as if he were her lifeline. She was definitely aroused. Might as well have some more fun. He stepped close again, holding her nape in a hard grip, looking down at her. \u201cCan you move at all, Linda?\u201d</p><p>He almost grinned as she pulled at the restraints, learning that she couldn\u2019t. The knowledge of her helplessness made her pupils dilate. She licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cSee, I don\u2019t want you moving while I play with this.\u201d He picked up the Wartenberg wheel, which had been located near the middle of the table.</p><p>LINDA FELT AS if her skin was vibrating with anxiety. Heavens, was he really going to use that thing on her? It looked like a slender pizza cutter, only some insane person had replaced the smooth roller with spiky pins. Why couldn\u2019t he start with the gentle toys?</p><p>He smiled at her and lightly ran the thing over her stomach.</p><p>It tickled like a line of bugs crawling over her skin. As she tried to squirm away, he laughed, then moved to her back, using the wheel up and down the muscles along her spine, then down, pressing harder over her butt, drawing burning lines over her body. Her focus constricted as the wheel created a fine tapestry of pain. Over her stomach, upward to the tender undersides of her breasts, around her nipples. The tracks flamed through her, lassoing her with the wonderful bite. Her breasts grew heavier, and her nipples contracted as if trying to escape their fate.</p><p>When he paused, she looked down to see thin red lines on her pale skin. Despite the wheel\u2019s cutting sensation, she saw no blood. Her gaze lifted to the toy, to his hand, to his face...to his eyes. He was watching her intently, studying her responses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A tremor started from her toes, working upward to her scalp. How could his single-minded attention be more arousing than the pain?</p><p>The sun lines at the corners of his eyes crinkled. Then the wheel circled the perimeter of her left areola, turned, and ran straight over the tip. The slash of pain was like he\u2019d drawn a knife over her. She gasped, her back arching, pressing forward as the brilliant heat burst inward.</p><p>His rasping chuckle scraped over her nerves, arousing her in an entirely different way. \u201cLove those tits, girl.\u201d</p><p>By the time he did her right nipple, her skin was on fire, sensitive and throbbing. After tossing the wheel onto the table, he cupped her breasts and firmly rubbed his calloused thumbs over the abused nipples.</p> <p>Glorious, erotic rawness. Unsure if she hurt or felt wonderful, she whimpered.</p><p>Delight filled his eyes.</p><p>He switched to the palm-wide, leather-covered paddle, smacking her bottom over and over. The pain was\u2014as Goldilocks said\u2014just right. A lovely impact with not too much of a sting, and when he started hitting hard, the sensation reverberated straight through to her core. Her clit swelled and throbbed.</p><p>When he paused, she made a sound and pulled at her restraints in protest. Don\u2019t stop.</p><p>He stepped in front of her, his face filling her vision. His grip on her hair pulled her head back, and he kissed her gently, luring her into responding before turning rough. Wet. Removing control from her in a way that took her willpower as well.</p> <p>Her eyelids were heavy, but she couldn\u2019t look away from his hard face\u2014the dent in his square chin, lines around his eyes, strong nose. A five o\u2019clock shadow darkened his jawline.</p><p>His firm lips quirked as she stared at him. \u201cLike the paddle on your ass, do you? How about other places?\u201d</p><p>He moved behind her, and light slaps ran down the backs of her thighs, then around to the fronts. To the insides. Stinging followed in the wake. Up and down and back up, arousal blossoming as the strikes approached the open area between her legs. Her whole body tensed with need. With fear...</p><p>Without speaking, he swatted the narrow paddle three times right on top of her labia and clit.</p><p>Oh God! The fireball turned into shockingly exquisite pleasure. She went up on tiptoes, hovering at the edge of release. The noise she made... She\u2019d never heard that sound before.</p><p>The paddle dropped onto the table, and his wide hand covered her throbbing pussy. Heat on top of heat. \u201cAlmost went over, little girl.\u201d His skilled fingers slid across her burning tissues in a purely erotic caress.</p> <p>One digit circled her unbearably swollen clit. Moved down. As he slowly, slowly pushed a finger inside her, his keen blue eyes held hers trapped. She stared helplessly, unable to speak, only feel, as he pressed deeper. Fully in, he rubbed his thumb over her clit until her hips arched forward.</p><p>His laugh rumbled like the bass drum in an orchestra. \u201cSoon enough, missy. First, I want to make you suffer.\u201d His voice dropped. \u201cHear you scream.\u201d The pale fire of his gaze held hers as he pressed down on her clit, making the swollen tissue hurt. Throb.</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d she whispered, and his eyes crinkled.</p><p>When he picked up the short two-tailed whip thing from the very end of the \u201cbad\u201d side of the table, her hands closed into fists. She hadn\u2019t liked its looks before and liked it less now.</p><p>Slowly, repetitively, he lashed up and down her bottom, and the horrid stinging made her flinch and try to escape. Tears sprang to her eyes. Overflowed. Hurts.</p><p>When he stopped, she pulled in a shuddering breath. His beard-scratchy face rubbed against her wet cheek as he murmured, \u201cFigured you wouldn\u2019t like the quirt.\u201d</p><p>The intense afterburn shimmered over her skin as if she\u2019d slid headlong into a hot springs. She pushed the question out: \u201cWhy then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I like seeing you squirm. And cry.\u201d Gently, he kissed the tears from her cheeks. His voice dropped to a low, merciless rumble. \u201cBecause when you know that I can\u2014and will\u2014make you take more than you wanted, even when it hurts, you slide far deeper.\u201d</p> <p>Her body shook as she stared at the resolve\u2014and satisfaction\u2014in his face. The truth dug into her with pinpoint claws, because he was right. She wanted that ruthless part of him. With him, she wouldn\u2019t have to beg for more, because he\u2019d force her to where the sharp edge between pain and pleasure slipped away, and he\u2019d keep her there, where her soul was bared to him.</p><p>As he read her surrender, his lips curved in a hard, hard smile.</p><p>When he released her from his gaze, she managed to draw in a breath.</p><p>After donning the furry glove she\u2019d tossed on the \u201cgood\u201d end of the table, he stroked her shoulder with the back of the glove. Fuzzy and soothing, yet her skin was so incredibly sensitive, she felt every tiny, soft strand. Her eyes half closed as he caressed her whole body.</p><p>\u201cLike the glove?\u201d The amusement in his voice pulled her eyes back open. \u201cYou didn\u2019t really check it out, though.\u201d He turned his glove-covered hand over and slid it, palm side down, across her collarbone to the top of her breast.</p><p>She sucked in a hard breath of air at the scritchy-scratchy feeling. When he lifted his hand, she saw the fur had concealed thumbtack-like points.</p><p>Alternating between the innocent fur side and the evil palm side, he glided over the tender places left by the quirt and the flogger. As her stomach muscles flinched, he pressed harder. \u201cDon\u2019t move, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She should move, do something, but as the glove created swaths of sparkling pain all over her body, she was sliding down, down, down into her happy place. Into the shadow world where decisions were made by someone else. Where her body wasn\u2019t really hers. Where the hurting and the yearning wove together into a basket that held her safely inside.</p><p>The glove spiraled up her inner thighs and, before she could tense, covered her pussy. A million spiky points pressed into her labia, ricocheting through her clit. God, she needed to come. Every cell in her body throbbed with burgeoning need, sharp and sweet, and she heard a long, husky moan. Hers.</p><p>The deep rumble was Sam\u2019s laugh. \u201cThere\u2019s a good girl.\u201d Something pinched her chin, and she dragged her eyes open to see Sam\u2019s icy ones. \u201cGive me a color, Linda.\u201d</p><p>Color? Oh, there was supposed to be a color. One to keep going. Her mind floated like foam on rolling waves. Continue or stop. Must continue. Like a stoplight. \u201cGreen. More. Green.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. Then his lips touched hers in a gentle kiss. \u201cFor a little while, then.\u201d</p><p>Something slapped against her bottom, and it hurt\u2014maybe it hurt. She couldn\u2019t even tell anymore as the molten sensation flowed through her. Caning. He was caning her, mostly on her bottom, light taps on her thighs, flicking at intervals between her legs hard enough to make her cry out. Hard enough to make her shake with need.</p><p>The wonderful edgy pattering continued on and on until her body felt so full of sensation that she was rocking. Humming. Her tipped-up lips tasted of the salt from her tears.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re done, missy.\u201d His voice splashed like rain into her warm pool of bliss. \u201cI\u2019m letting you loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore. Green. More.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, and his rough voice shivered over her, far sweeter than the whip. \u201cYou\u2019re past the point where you can decide. No more.\u201d</p><p>Coolness ringed her ankles when the cuffs came off. His fingers traced over her clit, circling, sending her to the edge, before he drew her legs together over the throbbing tissue.</p><p>Her whimper of protest got a laugh. He hooked an arm around her as he reached up to her wrists. Her shoulders seemed to groan\u2014or was that her?\u2014as her arms lowered.</p><p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d he said. Her head bounced off the clouds as he lifted her up into his arms, but he was warm and solid and so very safe. Her eyes closed again...or had she opened them at all?</p><p>\u201cAsk Peggy to clean up for me, please.\u201d</p><p>Was he talking to her? She rubbed her cheek against him, listening to the low reverberation of sound in his chest. His musky fragrance sent need washing in hot waves over her.</p><p>A voice murmured.</p><p>\u201cThe toys go into a plastic bag. It all goes behind the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d someone answered.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Tanner.\u201d</p><p>He was walking. Carrying her. The noise from the clubroom was a lovely song of torment and joy. She tried to lift her head, to see what was happening. A railing. Stairs. They were going upstairs.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>When a door shut, she opened her eyes again.</p><p>One of those sawhorse things was in the center of the room. Sam deposited her, stomach down, along the length of the padded surface, moving her until her forearms and knees rested on lower supports on each side. The cold leather on her burning skin sent a chill through her.</p><p>Slow and sure, he positioned her breasts so they dangled free.</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d She blinked, unsure if she wanted\u2014</p><p>He pinched her nipples, making her jolt. The carnal pain seared through her system, throwing her back into the clouds. Making him laugh.</p><p>As his hands moved over her roughly, harsh on her abused skin, the wonderfully hurtful caresses made her moan and squirm with need. \u201cPlease, Sam, I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby. And you\u2019re going to get that.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cI want to hear you scream a little first.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mind told her body to tense, but the anticipation of more was...wonderful. \u201cMore. Want more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But this will be different. Let\u2019s see how you like a clamp.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like clamps, did she? She tried to shake her head, but her cheek rested on the cushion and hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>He patted her hand. \u201cI\u2019m not going to restrain your arms, baby. Just your ass.\u201d He tugged her body down toward the end of the horse so her butt stuck out. Something pressed into her left calf\u2014a strap\u2014then the right. Another one chilled the skin on her lower back, and she realized she couldn\u2019t move her bottom at all. The sensation of being so exposed, so...ready...sent more need sizzling across her pussy. Want. Please, want.</p><p>He massaged her stinging ass cheeks, then smacked each one hard, and like coals with fresh tinder, the glow under her skin flamed up, searing through her in every color of the rainbow. Her moan shuddered inside her ribs before escaping.</p><p>Cold drizzled between her ass cheeks, making her squirm, and then he pressed something hard against her asshole. She instinctively tightened. Slowly he worked the plug through the rim of muscle, ruthlessly pushing in until her nerves sparkled like fireworks in the night. Confused, she tried to move, to escape, and couldn\u2019t. Her bottom was held right there for his use.</p><p>Her hands opened and closed convulsively as she realized he\u2019d do exactly what he wanted. Her arousal expanded like a balloon. Need to come. Oh, need to come.</p><p>When the anal plug plopped into place, throbbing and burning, she whimpered at the jagged onslaught of fresh pleasure.</p><p>She heard his belt, then the crinkle of a condom wrapper, and his grating laugh. \u201cNow for the part that you\u2019ll hate\u2014and will really enjoy.\u201d</p><p>What? The pulsing sense of need eroded her thoughts and tied her tongue.</p><p>His hands slid over her bottom, down her inner thighs. And then his fingers settled on her clit, pinching hard enough that she screamed and tried to buck.</p><p>The urgent coil in her lower belly tightened and grew.</p><p>His fingers released her. Then something else locked onto her clit, tighter and tighter, as if tiny teeth were gnawing on her. The exquisite bite was shocking, overwhelming, and everything inside her exploded. Oh God! Her body spasmed, tried to move...couldn\u2019t...and the waves of sensation spread outward through her body, filling her mind.</p><p>Before she could recover, she felt his finger opening her labia. His thick cock pressed against her entrance, pushed inside, stretching her ferociously. Too much. As the tidal wave of ecstasy swept her away, she screamed.</p><p>LINDA\u2019S SCREAM ALMOST sent Sam over the edge. The sound of a woman screaming and coming at the same time was the finest of wines, filling his soul. As her cunt convulsed around him in an unstoppable orgasm, her body shook like she\u2019d break into pieces.</p><p>He gave her a few seconds to adapt to his entry, then pulled back and thrust in harder. Faster. Damned if she didn\u2019t keep spasming around him. Couldn\u2019t complain about that.</p><p>She finally sagged against the sawhorse, gasping for breath as if he\u2019d held her underwater.</p><p>She was incredibly wet, and by God, he wanted to see her come again. He changed to a gentle sliding in and out as he ran his hands over her reddened back, savoring her moan. He\u2019d never had someone more fun to play with. To hurt. To fuck.</p><p>He kept his thrusts slow enough to maintain control until she stirred. As her eyes blinked open, he ran his hands over the backs of her thighs. When his fingers encountered the tiny raised lines, he knew she\u2019d get a fine burst of pain. As if in agreement, her cunt clenched around him, and he grinned. He could fuck her for years and never tire of it.</p><p>Mercilessly, he massaged her ass, pleased at the light welting, even more pleased at how she wiggled when the tender skin was further abused. As she started to pant, he tugged on the anal plug, adding new sensations. Overloading her system.</p><p>When he leaned forward, his cock rammed in deeper, right up against her cervix, and he heard her sharp inhalation, her attempt to squirm away. But the low back strap kept her right where he liked her, kept her feeling just what he wanted her to feel.</p><p>With his chest against her back, he reached around to palm her swaying breasts. Gorgeous breasts, heavy and large enough to fill his hands. He massaged them, tugged at them.</p><p>Her nipples were already sore from the wheel, the vampire glove, even a few hits from the quirt. When he pinched hard, her body stiffened, and her low shriek made him laugh. The way she tightened around his cock reaffirmed she was hardwired for pain, and those sensitive breasts made a direct circuit to her pussy. As he played with them, her breasts swelled, increasing his pleasure.</p> <p>Increasing hers. She gave a sweet moan and slid deeper into subspace.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d He pounded into her hard enough to make the sawhorse rock. As he shoved her toward coming again, her cunt clamped down and tested his control.</p><p>Her breathing quickened, the sound mingling with her moans as he teased her nipples. Goddamn. His jaw clenched. His straining cock felt as if it would split; his balls seemed as if they\u2019d been compressed between boards. Almost there\u2014both of them.</p><p>Reaching around, he removed the clamp from her clit and could almost hear blood rush back into the abused nub. He drank in how her wailing scream filled the room, how her neck arched to lift her head, how her core clenched and spasmed around him as her orgasm hit her like a pile driver.</p><p>He gripped her hair, pulling as he released control and drove into her fast and hard. His balls were boiling, and the heat poured out of them and through his cock in bone-jolting jerks as he came and came and came.</p><p>God. Damn. With an effort, he released her hair and buried his face in the scented silkiness, content to stay just where he was\u2014buried as deep as a man could go.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Seated at a chair near a suspension scene, Aaron watched the little brunette trainee clean off a nearby table. Quite amusing how Sally\u2014wasn\u2019t that her name?\u2014never looked at him if she could help it. Not since he\u2019d slapped her face for speaking up during a scene.</p><p>Her horror had been delightful\u2014her tears even more so.</p><p>But everything had gone to hell after that. Z\u2019s mouthy sub had charged in, which meant Z had gotten involved. Truly a mess. At least the trainee had admitted she hadn\u2019t specified no slapping. When she said she\u2019d been too shocked to safe word, he\u2019d almost laughed. What was the point of slapping someone if you didn\u2019t shock her?</p><p>But it had pissed him off when Z monitored him closely for a time afterward. That was the slut\u2019s fault. He motioned to her. \u201cYou. Come here.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw tightened. Didn\u2019t it just break his heart that the trainee bitch had to acknowledge a Dom, even one she hated?</p><p>She approached, although he almost laughed at the ample space she left between them. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring me a...\u201d He frowned, remembering he\u2019d already had his two drinks. Cullen kept careful track. \u201cBring me a mineral water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d When he raised his hand and she flinched, he laughed. \u201cRemember our scene, do you? I enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>Her whole body turned statue still, and an angry flush lit her cheeks. But, oh, too bad for her, the trainee couldn\u2019t yell at a Dom. Couldn\u2019t do shit.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll ask for you again.\u201d He massaged his hand, enjoying how warily she watched him.</p><p>She clenched her tray so hard her knuckles turned white, but her voice stayed polite. Cold. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that would be a waste of your time...Sir.\u201d</p><p>The slut had a backbone. And he couldn\u2019t prod her further without chancing Z\u2019s attention. He flicked his fingers at her. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>Her posture displayed a cock-hardening mix of anger and fear as she walked away. He shook his head, regretting that the Harvest Association hadn\u2019t picked her up. She\u2019d have been perfect for the \u201crebellious slave\u201d themed auction. Unfortunately, she\u2019d gone to visit relatives before the contractor could kidnap her.</p><p>Truly a shame. He\u2019d have loved to break the insolent bitch. Easy-peasy. Force her mouth open with a spider gag and let everyone face fuck her until only whimpers came out. Wouldn\u2019t take long before that cocky walk would turn to a slink, showing her fear of attracting any attention.</p><p>But that opportunity was gone. The Harvest Association wouldn\u2019t expand back into the southern quadrant for quite some time, if ever. Stinking FBI.</p><p>However, the northeast quadrant was in operation, and the Harvest Association took vindictive to new levels. The two asshole agents leading the investigation might well come to regret their actions.</p><p>Something to look forward to.</p><p>Turning, Aaron eyed the unoccupied submissives near the bar. His need wasn\u2019t urgent since he\u2019d indulged in a whore last night. When he\u2019d flashed a wad of money, the foolish woman had climbed right into his car. Poor safety awareness on her part. A shame she\u2019d never learn any better.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been a bad fuck. After getting off, he\u2019d played with her, hurting her with his fists, then his knife. He\u2019d been furious when she got quiet, like she\u2019d mentally retreated. But no\u2014she\u2019d been dead. No stamina. Truly, the older slaves were more fun.</p><p>Damn Davies for latching on to the redheaded slut.</p><p>Then again, she\u2019d undoubtedly be around. Without Davies. Her hair would look good in his drawer. Maybe he\u2019d tie it up with a black ribbon for contrast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For now...Aaron studied the submissives again. Perhaps the sharp-nosed slut with dark hair would serve his tastes.</p><p>Linda blinked. Dark. Had she gone blind? She tried to work up some concern, but at the moment, her body felt...awesome. So replete that her insides throbbed with satisfaction. Her ass was tender, her clit ached, and her skin sizzled with delicious pain. With each breath she took, her breasts rubbed against soft fabric. Warmth radiated into her from... Oh.</p><p>She was on Sam\u2019s lap, his powerful arms holding her firmly to his chest. A blanket had been wrapped around her, and her face was buried in the hollow of his neck.</p><p>She considered lifting her head, but that seemed like too much effort.</p> <p>\u201cYou back with me, baby?\u201d The rumble of his voice was delicious.</p><p>When she wiggled, the scrape of his rough jeans on her tender, bare bottom was like sitting on white-hot coals. She jumped to her feet.</p><p>He yanked her back down. \u201cStay put.\u201d</p><p>Ow, ow, ow. \u201cSadist.\u201d But already the burn was sliding into a sweet throb.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cThat supposed to be an insult?\u201d His calloused hand stroked down her bare back, making her hiss at the wash of wonderful pain, and he laughed again before reaching for something. A bottle. \u201cDrink some of this.\u201d</p> <p>The strawberry-flavored sports drink poured into her parched mouth like a river of coolness. \u201cMmm.\u201d She sipped more, glorying in the taste and all the bright sensations\u2014the feel of Sam\u2019s warm body, how her skin burned in places, ached in others, the sound of his heartbeat, and music from outside the room. Everything. The comfort of being held\u2014cuddled\u2014made her want to cry and burrow even closer. She\u2019d never felt so close to another human being, as if a ribbon of awareness cycled from him to her.</p><p>At a discreet tap on the door, she reluctantly lifted her head. The time for their special world must be over since she saw Raoul in the hallway. \u201cThere\u2019s a window in the door.\u201d</p><p>Sam rose and set her in the chair. \u201cSomeone\u2019s always on duty up here. Z doesn\u2019t take chances with his submissives.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. Surely someone didn\u2019t stand at the window all the time. \u201cSo if I\u2019d yelled red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAudio is handled by computer. He\u2019s got some odd software that can pick out words and distress\u2014though the distress category gets a lot of false positives.\u201d Sam winked. \u201cSeems that to a computer, an orgasm sounds like a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>He stepped outside. The men\u2019s voices drifted in through the open doorway.</p> <p>Pulling the blanket higher, Linda watched. How come men looked so...edible...in the morning when women looked like hell? With a frown, she tried to smooth out what was probably the worst case of bedhead in all the world.</p><p>Sam glanced back at her, and his eyes lit with laughter. \u201cI like the rumpled look...since I made you that way. It\u2019s a turn-on.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Well. Far be it from her to deny a man his little diversions. Then again...</p><p>When she kept finger combing her hair, his lips quirked. \u201cRaoul and Kim are leaving. Do you want to go with them, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, heavens!\u201d Where were her brains? How could she possibly have forgotten she\u2019d arrived with people? \u201cTell him I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>Her clothes were folded on top of Sam\u2019s toy bag. She donned her halter top and skirt, inhaling hard when the fabric encountered sore skin. Memory after memory of how her skin had gotten that way sent heat flushing through her until her face probably glowed. I want to stay.</p><p>Leaning against the door frame as he talked with Raoul, Sam wasn\u2019t bothering to conceal his enjoyment. Once she was dressed, he walked over and pulled her into a hug. \u201cIf you stay, we could move to one of the rooms with a bed. I\u2019d like to run my hands over you and hear those noises before I took you again.\u201d He squeezed her welted bottom, making her moan. He rumbled a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s a good sound.\u201d</p><p>As the sultry burn washed through her, every drop of blood pooled in her lower half and set up an urgent need. She wanted it all again. The pain. His demands. Him taking her. She rested her forehead against him, trying to burrow closer. To hang on forever. \u201cI\u2019m opening the store tomorrow. I have to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She felt him kiss the top of her head.</p><p>When Linda stepped into the hallway, Raoul was leaning against the railing. His dark gaze swept over her in a slow perusal before his lips curled in an easy smile. \u201cYou look as if you had a good time.\u201d</p><p>After all the things Sam had done to her, how could she possibly have a blush left? But she did.</p><p>Beside her, Sam ran a knuckle down her cheek, obviously enjoying the color show. \u201cIf you get depressed or weepy, you tell Raoul or you call me. Clear?\u201d</p><p>A definite order. Sometimes that military background of his popped right out, didn\u2019t it? \u201cOkay, Sarge. Got it.\u201d Oh, bad mouth. And if he slapped her butt right now, she\u2019d melt into a puddle at his feet.</p><p>He stilled, gave her an assessing look from ice-blue eyes, then snorted. \u201cYou look so sweet, but you got some brat in there.\u201d He tugged on her hair, and Lord help her, even her scalp was sore. She didn\u2019t make any noise, but his eyes crinkled with what he must have seen in her face. \u201cWant me to come by tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Her heart lifted. Yes yes yes. Then she felt a twinge of guilt. He was always driving to her house. That didn\u2019t seem fair. \u201cI can come to your place instead.\u201d</p><p>The laughter disappeared from his eyes, as did any trace of softness. \u201cAh\u2014\u201d</p><p>She took a step back, realizing he\u2019d never invited her over. Never even talked about his farm. Because he didn\u2019t want her there? \u201cOh. Never mind.\u201d The inside of her chest suddenly hurt worse than her back and bottom. Did he think she\u2019d contaminate his home?</p><p>Sam reached out, but she stepped away.</p><p>\u201cLinda.\u201d</p><p>No laugh, no apology. All she heard in that one word was reluctance. Regret. He really didn\u2019t want her at his house.</p><p>The Overseer\u2019s voice slid into her head. \u201cYou\u2019re a slut. A fuck hole. That\u2019s all you are.\u201d She swallowed. She\u2019d thought Sam liked her...liked her for more than... The cold wind of reality ripped any lingering warmth away, leaving her exposed and chilled. Trembling.</p><p>\u201cI really need to go.\u201d She took two steps to Raoul, hoping, still hoping, that Sam would react.</p><p>But it was Kim\u2019s Master who put an arm around her. \u201cCome, chiquita.\u201d</p><p>When he gently pulled her to his side, she blinked back tears. Had there ever been such a nice man? \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, burying her face against his chest.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he whispered into her hair. He lifted his head. \u201cMy friend, you are a fool.\u201d</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>As Raoul guided her down the hallway to where Kim waited, no footsteps sounded behind them. Eyes blurry with tears, Linda looked back. Sam was gripping the railing. His head was bowed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t come after her.</p><p>Nolan\u2019s construction crew took Sundays off, which suited Sam just fine. He was irritable enough without the noise of construction\u2014had been irritable ever since he shoved both boots in his mouth with Linda. Hell, his boots hadn\u2019t gone in his mouth; instead they\u2019d trampled all over an innocent submissive.</p><p>You\u2019re a bastard, Davies. He\u2019d picked up the phone several times, intending to apologize and to...to do what? What did he want to happen between them?</p><p>Tilting back on his porch chair, feet up on the railing, he drank coffee and watched the cold, gray world come to life. From the chicken pen, the rooster announced dawn. In the pastures, the cattle and horses trailed down toward the pond. Connagher was doing perimeter patrol, lifting his leg in some preset canine pattern to mark his territory. With no field hands today, the orange groves were quiet.</p><p>Chores or not, he couldn\u2019t summon the energy to start moving. Caffeine hadn\u2019t helped his energy level. Time hadn\u2019t helped his guilt.</p><p>The pain in Linda\u2019s eyes had stabbed right through him. Made him realize how badly he\u2019d screwed up. He hadn\u2019t thought, just reacted. The idea of a woman in his home\u2014after the war zone it had been during his marriage\u2014had paralyzed him completely. Seemed that four years of quiet hadn\u2019t erased the bitterness and memories.</p><p>He wanted Linda\u2014hell, yes\u2014but for what? A play partner? An occasional fuck buddy? The thought thinned his mouth. She deserved better. He had plenty of play partners and fuck buddies. She meant more. The feel of her around his cock was fantastic; the feel of her in his arms, warm and soft, was even better. The hollow of her neck smelled faintly of lavender.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he shook his head. Got it bad. He could remember every laugh line on her face and see how her freckles faded into the pure white of her breasts. He liked how unexpected things would catch her fancy and her laughter would escape, so surprisingly full-bodied that he\u2019d grin every time.</p><p>She hummed when she cooked. Sang when she scrubbed. She wore her music as another woman would wear jewelry.</p><p>She was fucking brave. And smart. Fun to talk with. Cute with her grumpiness in the mornings.</p><p>If she lived here, they\u2019d... Yeah, that right there was the problem. He liked being single. Compared to the alternative he\u2019d experienced, he could live with occasional loneliness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced over his shoulder at the small window he\u2019d replaced after Nancy\u2019s door-slamming tantrum had shattered the antique glass. For a year after the divorce, it seemed like her screams and vitriol had continued to echo off the walls. He and Nicole had moved around the place like shell-shocked survivors. Then they\u2019d slowly redecorated the entire house. Breakables had worked their way back in.</p><p>How could he bring someone into this carefully crafted peace? Even briefly?</p><p>Hell, he hadn\u2019t even known Linda that long.</p><p>Like Nancy. Three dates and she\u2019d turned up pregnant. He\u2019d had no clue about her messed-up welfare family or her drug habit.</p> <p>Then again, he\u2019d spent long hours in Linda\u2019s home, enjoying her company. He\u2019d scened with her, bared her body and her soul. And sure as hell he\u2019d been a Dom long enough to know when a submissive was lying.</p><p>Linda was exactly who she\u2019d shown herself to be: a courageous, warmhearted survivor.</p><p>His mouth twisted. He was the scarred survivor of a fucked-up marriage, and he\u2019d hurt her badly. Maybe she was better off without him.</p><p>Linda\u2019s store was a heaven-sent distraction. She needed to stay busy because her spirits took a dive whenever she thought of Sam...or the previous weekend...or the times with him before that. She\u2019d thought they had more between them than just floggings and sex. She\u2019d thought they\u2019d...connected.</p><p>Guess not.</p> <p>Scowling, she set another basket on the shelf, angling it so the subtle design showed.</p><p>With Sam, she\u2019d felt safe. Safe enough to let go, to let pain transform into pleasure, to let herself slide into her happy place. His strength, his voice, even his brutal honesty was reassuring. So was the way he\u2019d hold her afterward with surprisingly tender hands, caring for her as if she...meant...something.</p><p>Yeah, I meant a lot to him. As long as I stayed away from his home.</p><p>As tears burned her eyes, she set two more baskets\u2014small bright ones\u2014on each side of the first.</p><p>Still, no matter how it ended, knowing him had been worth it. And last weekend had been wonderful. She\u2019d learned that other women accepted and openly enjoyed their BDSM lifestyles. And what a relief it had been to acknowledge her own need to be hurt and dominated. She smiled slightly. Her bookaholic friends \u201cneeded\u201d to read or they got irritable, and she felt that way about pain. Since that was her \u201cthing,\u201d she\u2019d better acknowledge it.</p><p>And she\u2019d better not date men who thought unconventional meant sick.</p> <p>Darn it. It wasn\u2019t fair that the one man who accepted her\u2014no, who really liked her other side\u2014didn\u2019t want more. Her lips quivered. She\u2019d wanted to give him all of herself.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even hate him. Well, not much. He\u2019d been gentle with her, slept in her house to protect her, cared for her after their scenes. He wasn\u2019t a bastard, although she\u2019d called him a few nasty names off and on all week. He just didn\u2019t see what they had together as a...relationship.</p><p>Obviously, she\u2019d read more into his actions than he\u2019d intended. Gritting her teeth, she shoved the Overseer\u2019s voice away. I\u2019m not a slut.</p><p>She gave her head a firm shake. Yes, it was a pity that her little jar of hopes got knocked over, but how long was she going to whine about it? A year or two?</p><p>Do your job and be a shopkeeper.</p><p>A few minutes later, as she set the last basket on the shelf, she heard, \u201cHey, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Turning, she saw her son walking through the store, and her spirits lifted. \u201cCharles, how nice. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to give you something.\u201d His brown eyes warmed with happiness as he handed her a grocery sack.</p> <p>\u201cWell.\u201d She opened the sack. It was filled with... \u201cSweet grass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I was over at the coast and saw dunes of it. It\u2019s the right kind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s lovely. It\u2019ll make the prettiest baskets.\u201d</p><p>He rocked back and forth, hands in his pockets, pleased as punch with his surprise. How many bouquets of flowers, sheet music, books, and pottery had her generous-spirited son gifted her with over the years? Even as a toddler, he\u2019d brought home pretty rocks for Mommy. They were still on the kitchen table, warming her heart whenever she saw them.</p><p>\u201cThank you, honey. This is wonderful.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, gave her a quick squeeze, and kissed her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve got a class in an hour. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>As Charles trotted out of the store, an elderly customer approached the counter, beaming. \u201cWhat a nice boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Linda\u2019s heart expanded with pride. \u201cHe really is.\u201d</p><p>A quick sale later, the woman left, her newly purchased tote sagging from the addition of a diet soda and an assortment of Belgian chocolates and truffles. Someone really liked her fancy chocolates.</p><p>As the customer stepped onto the boardwalk, a man stepped back to let her pass. Lee. Linda watched him walk into the store, his expression open. Friendly. Not a fancy chocolate person. No, he was a plain milk chocolate bar. Straightforward. No surprises. Liked by everyone.</p><p>She looked away. Sam would be dark chocolate with almonds and sea salt. Complex. Not overly sweet. Not to everyone\u2019s taste. But having experienced Sam made it difficult to return to everyday chocolate.</p><p>As Lee walked up to the counter, Linda smiled at him. \u201cHi there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful today.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI came by to see if you wanted to go to a movie tonight. We can check the listings and find something we both like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pull out one of those chick romances, and I\u2019ll beat your butt, missy.\u201d The memory of Sam\u2019s grating warning made her throat tighten. When she\u2019d tossed Dirty Dancing into his lap, she\u2019d learned in a painful way that he didn\u2019t make idle threats. That\u2019s over, Linda. Move on.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think...\u201d She took his hand. The knowledge that her decision would hurt him pressed a heavy weight onto her shoulders. But she wouldn\u2019t lead him on as Sam had done with her. Lee deserved honesty. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work, Lee. I like edgy sex, and you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d been kind. During her awkward attempt at discussing it with him, he\u2019d tried so carefully to hide his disapproval.</p><p>His expression was that of a man whose terrier had nipped him. \u201cLinda, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of us is wrong.\u201d Thank you, Gabi. I know that now. \u201cBut we have different desires and needs.\u201d She pulled in a breath, hoping she wouldn\u2019t lose him as a friend. \u201cI think we should call this quits.\u201d</p><p>He stood silently for a minute as if hoping she\u2019d change her mind. \u201cWell. We might have found a way to compromise, but...rumor has it you\u2019re seeing someone. I guess he\u2019s giving you what you like.\u201d Lee squeezed her fingers and pulled back. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out, I hope you\u2019ll give me another chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Brows drawn together in unhappiness, he turned and walked out of the store.</p><p>She sighed. Only Lee could have handled an awkward situation so smoothly, but she still felt like scum for hurting him.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey. Don\u2019t look like that went very well.\u201d</p><p>Linda pulled her gaze from the empty door to see Dwayne by the wall, his purple and green shirt clashing with the colorful paintings. What had he heard? How could she have been so indiscreet as to have an intimate talk in her own store? Dumb.</p><p>Even dumber to have discussed anything in front of a reporter. Ignoring him, she walked to the other side of the store and started restocking shelves.</p><p>He followed. \u201cAre you having a difficult time adjusting? Going from being a slave to a normal person?\u201d Slave. He said it as if he liked the taste of the word.</p><p>Her skin crawled. Note to self\u2014never date a reporter. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to buy anything, please leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your business fall off when people realized what you are...were?\u201d He casually leaned against the wall shelves, his gaze as avid as a dog looking at raw meat. \u201cYou know, I heard a rumor about a place you visited before your kidnapping. Disturbing stuff.\u201d</p><p>Her skin went cold, and she could actually feel the blood leave her face. Even knowing her reaction confirmed his rumor, she couldn\u2019t stop herself. \u201cGet out. You\u2019re not welcome in my store.\u201d She pointed to the door.</p><p>His expression darkened. \u201cYou\u2019d do better to talk to me. Give me something juicy, and maybe I won\u2019t use that other information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet. Out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He paused in the door to look back. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be sorry.\u201d He stalked out, bumping against the coffee shop owner who\u2019d stopped on the boardwalk.</p><p>Oh, God. As Linda\u2019s knees started to buckle, she grabbed the shelf. Two totes fell onto the floor, flattened like roadkill.</p><p>\u201cMy heavens, he threatened you!\u201d With an appalled expression, Betty entered the shop. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re gonna be sorry.\u2019 That\u2019s a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her energy leaked away, leaving exhaustion behind. Would this never end? \u201cBut he wouldn\u2019t be the first reporter to print nasty things.\u201d About slaves. About me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat an awful man.\u201d Betty set her hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Curtis about the quality of staff he employs.\u201d Giving a huff of fury, she marched out.</p><p>Linda stared after her. Brassy red hair with graying roots, round face, quick temper, the owner of the coffee shop was as sweet as her pastries. However, if the newspaper revealed Linda had visited a BDSM club before being kidnapped, Betty\u2019s sweetness might quickly change.</p><p>Odd, wasn\u2019t it? As a slave, she\u2019d thought rescue would end all her problems. Guess not. Mouth flattening, she straightened her shoulders. It was a nightmare, but all nightmares eventually ended, right?

As he walked down the sidewalk, he saw the red and yellow balloons dotting the yard next door. Children were laughing, yelling, whooping. Sounded like someone was having a birthday party. His jaw tightened as he remembered the one time he\u2019d given a party for Nicole.</p><p>An hour before the party, Nancy had gone to town to fetch the cake. After demanding a refund, she\u2019d used the money to buy drugs. Oxycodone. She\u2019d returned midparty, higher than a kite, foulmouthed and out of control. He\u2019d had to ask another child\u2019s mother to supervise as he kept his wife out of the room. Had to turn the music up to drown out her yelling and cursing. Had to call the parents to pick up their children early. A major clusterfuck.</p><p>Nicole had refused any more parties. So each birthday, he\u2019d taken her and her buddies to a children\u2019s pizza place or a skating rink or a water park. They\u2019d never told Nancy.</p><p>Had to wonder if Nicole would have found it easier to have a consistently abusive mother rather than one who was loving at intervals, but viciously destructive the rest of the time? Why the hell couldn\u2019t he have made her life easier?</p><p>When he reached Linda\u2019s, he spotted new white blotches on the house. He scowled. The asshole had marked up her house again. Because Sam hadn\u2019t been around. Looked like he was letting everyone down.</p> <p>As he tapped on the door, he felt his muscles tighten. Would she still be pissed off? Or worse, hurt?</p><p>The door opened. \u201cSam!\u201d Happiness lit her eyes. Then her expression turned flat. \u201cGo away.\u201d She started to close the door.</p><p>Hell. He stuck his foot in the door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your boot out.\u201d She shoved on the door and glared.</p><p>Stubborn woman. He pushed the door open far enough for his shoulders. Far enough that he could bracket her face with his hands and compel her to actually see him. Her eyes looked haunted. His chest squeezed. \u201cLinda, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApology accepted. Now go.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his remorse, he had to laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s not forgiveness, girl. Is that hypocrisy what you taught your children?\u201d</p><p>His insult struck home, but she didn\u2019t retreat. \u201cSo I\u2019m a bad example. I didn\u2019t teach them to be fuck toys either.\u201d</p><p>He slapped the door hard enough to make his palm sting. \u201cYou\u2019re no goddamned fuck toy!\u201d He pulled in a breath. Stow it, Davies. \u201cYou are undoubtedly the strongest woman I know.\u201d</p><p>Surprise weakened her posture.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to hear me grovel?\u201d</p><p>She leaned her head against the edge of the door and closed her eyes. A second passed. Another.</p><p>The sound of her shuddering breath shook him. If she started to cry, she would break his heart.</p><p>Finally, she looked at him, then nodded. \u201cAll right. Come on in.\u201d</p> <p>AS SAM WALKED past her, the chill winter air slipped in the door after him. Linda shook her head. How in the world had he managed to change her mind? She didn\u2019t have anything to say to him; there was nothing between them except pain and sex.</p><p>As if to refute that, he gathered her into a warm, nonsexual hug. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t want to\u201d\u2014he snorted\u2014\u201cbe my fuck toy, can we be friends?\u201d</p><p>Friends? Why did his work shirts have to smell like sunshine? She rested her cheek on the well-worn fabric, thinking of all the times he\u2019d held her. Talked to her. He\u2019d helped her scrape her house. Had cooked her breakfast. Demanded an old Clint Eastwood movie as payback for her Katharine Hepburn one. Played guitar with her and then for her as she wove a new basket. Somehow, in those few days, he\u2019d sneaked right past her defenses. Yes, friends. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was rude.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his chin on the top of her head. \u201cI like knowing you can fight back.\u201d</p><p>Me too. And more than fight back. Darned if she\u2019d let him get away with only an apology. \u201cAre you going to explain?\u201d</p><p>The muscles under her cheek turned rigid. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Just the one word. But it was enough to tell her he had a reason for not wanting her to see his home\u2014one that made him uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t want to tell her.</p><p>Although Frederick hadn\u2019t had a problem talking about anything and everything, Charles had been a taciturn teenager. So she\u2019d treat Sam as she did Charles. \u201cCome and help me get supper ready.\u201d Kitchens were designed for sharing more than food.</p><p>She settled Sam on a stool at the big island and assigned him to putting together a salad. When she put a glass of wine in front of him, he gave her a surprised look.</p><p>\u201cNo beer, sorry.\u201d Her lips twitched as she glanced at the sink where she\u2019d dumped the contents of the three bottles of beer he\u2019d left in her refrigerator.</p><p>His gaze followed hers, and laughter lit his eyes. \u201cYou got a nasty temper there, missy.\u201d He took a sip of wine.</p><p>After a second of thought, she abandoned her original plan of a supper of tomato soup and crackers. Potatoes went into the oven. She browned pork chops, poured cream of mushroom soup over them, and tucked them in to bake as well.</p><p>\u201cSalad\u2019s done,\u201d Sam said. The tightness had left his face, and he\u2019d finished his wine. She poured him more and some for herself.</p><p>After putting crackers and cheese on a platter, she sat beside him. \u201cWhat\u2019s at your house that you don\u2019t want me to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike dead wives stored in closets?\u201d When a corner of his mouth curved up with amusement, her breath caught. He had such a hard face that his sense of humor tended to catch her by surprise.</p><p>\u201cYeah, like that.\u201d Following techniques learned from raising teenagers, Linda turned her attention to the cheese and crackers.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ex-wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He put a piece of cheese on a cracker and simply held it. Stared at it. \u201cShe was\u2014is\u2014a drug addict. Made life hell.\u201d He rubbed his jaw. \u201cI haven\u2019t taken a woman there since. When you...\u201d He paused.</p><p>\u201cWomen don\u2019t go home with you? Ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His mouth tightened.</p><p>Heavens. She stared at him. That must have been one nasty marriage. Considering how many whips Sam owned, his wife was lucky to have survived. Then again, she\u2019d come to realize that although he might be a sadist\u2014or because he was one\u2014he held to stronger rules of conduct than most \u201cnormal\u201d guys. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what you went through. So it wasn\u2019t about me at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He turned his hand over and squeezed her fingers. \u201cJust me being a goddamned idiot. You\u2019re welcome to come out to the farm, Linda.\u201d</p><p>A simple, sincere invitation. Her heart did a flip-flop. I\u2019m in trouble, all right. But what would it hurt to see where this would go? She leaned her cheek against his rough-skinned hand as the warmth in her heart blossomed. \u201cI\u2019d like to see your place someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s spring. There\u2019ll soon be babies\u2014chicks, calves, foals, goslings.\u201d He tugged her hair. \u201cYou\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a mother?\u201d She huffed a laugh and added as a joke, \u201cAre fuck toys supposed to be into babies?\u201d</p><p>His bark of a laugh was a reward. \u201cGirl, you\u2019re as maternal as they come.\u201d The warmth in his gaze said he found that side of her nature attractive. Found her attractive.</p><p>The glow of that disappeared when he yanked her to her feet. \u201cTime you learned not to call yourself names.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. No excuses. No more.\u201d His grip was daunting, his uncompromising expression even more so.</p><p>She had a feeling that even begging wasn\u2019t going to save her poor bottom.</p><p>A noise roused Linda. Was her next-door neighbor working on his house again? So early? I am not getting up yet. Unless... She rolled over and disappointingly found no one to rouse. Darn early risers.</p><p>The pounding started up again. Phooey. As she tried to burrow into the bedding, various hurts came to life. The sheet scraped over her sore back and bottom. Her breasts were tender from the wonderfully ouchy clamps Sam had used. As her lips curved at the memory, her nipples tightened into peaks that made the ache even worse.</p><p>She wiggled her butt on the bed to increase the burn there, enjoying both the memory and the wakening flame inside her.</p><p>Makeup sex with a sadist was amazing.</p><p>More pounding. Could that be her door? Not fair. I haven\u2019t even had breakfast yet. Grumpily, she slipped out of bed and picked up her robe. The children planned to visit next weekend, so it wouldn\u2019t be them. Had she paid the paperboy yet? Probably some door-to-door salesman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She heard the door open.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d Charles\u2019s voice.</p><p>Oh no. Oh bad. Frantically, she dropped her robe and yanked on jeans, a bra, and a T-shirt. Please let Sam be dressed. She hurried out.</p><p>Sam was dressed. Thank you, God. In the middle of the living room, both her children stared at him as if the man was the devil come to life.</p> <p>Busted. Her lips quirked. Moms weren\u2019t supposed to have sex, obviously. She\u2019d always tried to be discreet the few times a man had spent the night, but honestly, she had a right to her own life. Her children were adults, after all\u2014or so they kept informing her. \u201cWhat are you two doing here?</p><p>They turned to her. Brenna\u2019s face was white. Flushed with anger, Charles glared at her. \u201cNo, the question is what were you doing?\u201d He slapped a newspaper down on the coffee table.</p><p>She glanced at it. In a huge font, the headline read: SEX SLAVE VISITED FETISH CLUB. The letters started to dance up and down as a swarm of bees buzzed in her head. Her knees buckled.</p><p>Sam caught her with a steely arm around her waist. \u201cEasy, girl. Sit.\u201d</p><p>As he helped her into a chair, she wanted to cling\u2014needed to. Instead she put her hands in her lap. The buzzing didn\u2019t let up.</p> <p>\u201cThat said\u201d\u2014Charles pointed to the paper\u2014\u201cyou-you went to a BDSM club. Where they whip people. Perverts chain up women. You fucking brought the kidnapping on yourself.\u201d She\u2019d never seen him wear such a look of disgust, and he was looking at her.</p><p>Perverts. An invisible hand ringed Linda\u2019s throat, squeezing her words back, keeping them inside. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201dNot dirty, not filthy, not a pervert. Am I? Just last night, she\u2019d let Sam hurt her. Had liked it.</p><p>Brenna had tears in her eyes. \u201cEveryone in my dorm saw the newspaper. Were whispering about...you. They know you\u2019re my mother.\u201d Her voice got louder. \u201cYou put us through all that because you went out trolling for sex? Everyone\u2019s going to think I\u2019m a slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d How could she explain the difference?</p><p>\u201cYour mother was the victim,\u201d Sam snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t treat her like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d Charles\u2019s color heightened as he looked at Sam, then her.</p> <p>She glanced at Sam. Dressed but unshaven. And her cheeks and neck were undoubtedly reddened from the beard stubble. Her lips swollen.</p><p>\u201cI saw pictures from the club. Women being whipped.\u201d Brenna stared at Linda as if she\u2019d turned into something hideous. \u201cHow could you go to a place like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, whipping. For real.\u201d Charles\u2019s jaw jutted out, and he took a step toward Sam. \u201cSo you some big bad sadist? Didn\u2019t think we\u2019d know those words, huh, Mom? Isn\u2019t the fucking Internet great?\u201d He widened his stance as he glared at Sam. \u201cYou a sadist? Huh?\u201d</p><p>A whirlpool of misery was pulling Linda in.</p><p>Sam dismissed her son as if he were a two-year-old having a tantrum. \u201cNot your business, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I figured.\u201d</p><p>Damn you, Sam. With that answer, he might as well have said yes.</p><p>As her children stared at Sam, Linda lowered her head. Her hands trembled. Abrasions from the rope Sam had used on her wrists showed below the shirtsleeves. She pulled in a breath and lost it again because her children were looking at her. As if she were a freak.</p> <p>\u201cI feel sick,\u201d Brenna said.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Charles\u2019s lips curled up. \u201cYou\u2019re just a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t finish that.\u201d Sam\u2019s voice was a threatening growl.</p><p>Charles took a hasty step back.</p><p>Her heart seemed to crack within her chest. They don\u2019t know\u2014don\u2019t understand. At their age, a parent\u2019s vulnerability would be treated with scorn. She\u2019d seen how cruel children could be.</p><p>But not mine. Not until now.</p><p>Linda rose, surprised the floor held her even though the world had shattered. Her eyes blurred with tears as she looked at her daughter. Once she\u2019d been so little and her mommy had been the only one who could comfort her. So many memories. Walking and rocking her for hours when she had croup, singing lullabies after a nightmare, picking just the right cartoon Band-Aid for a scraped knee.</p><p>Her lips trembled as she turned to her son. How many hours had she sat with him in her lap? His cheeks flushed with fever, head on her shoulder, sucking his thumb as they watched The Lion King for the hundredth time. Now he looked at her as if he\u2019d never seen her before.</p><p>Maybe she hadn\u2019t seen them before either. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Charles said.</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d Linda pointed to the door. \u201cAll of you. I don\u2019t want any of you in my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Brenna took a step forward.</p><p>Linda felt sobs welling up, and sheer rage drove them back. She turned her gaze to Sam, who\u2019d as much as admitted he was a sadist. \u201cYou too. Out.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, glanced at her children, then simply walked out the door.</p><p>She turned her attention to her self-righteous children. They\u2019d never even been spanked, let alone beaten. Not been whipped. Or raped. Or called names like \u201cslut\u201d and \u201cwhore.\u201d Never gone hungry. And somehow grown up without any compassion whatsoever.</p><p>She\u2019d thought she was a good mother, but she\u2019d failed. \u201cGet out. I don\u2019t want you in my house.\u201d</p><p>Charles turned white. \u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet. Out!\u201d The first tear spilled over as she watched them leave. More tears followed as she stumbled to the door, locked it, and sagged against it. Why. Oh God, why?</p><p>She should never have returned. Should have gone far away. Should have died instead of Holly. Burying her face in her arms, she cried.</p><p>Hours later, Linda walked into her store. Gail\u2019s first grandchild was being baptized, and Linda had agreed to let her clerk off early.</p><p>If not for that, she might not have left her house at all, especially after reading the newspaper. Dwayne had interviewed a person who\u2019d watched Linda being flogged in the BDSM club the night she was abducted. The slanted wording implied that in being kidnapped, she\u2019d gotten what was coming to her.</p><p>No wonder her children had been upset. But the way they\u2019d behaved? As she forced tears back, the hole in her heart gushed agony with every beat. But she\u2019d survive. Slavery had taught her how to do that. She\u2019d learned how to keep putting one foot in front of the other, no matter what happened. Survival didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t hurt; it only meant she was alive.</p><p>\u201cGood, you\u2019re here!\u201d Her clerk looked up, and her smile wavered slightly. She\u2019d obviously read the paper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Linda said. The dirty slut has arrived. Here was one more person who thought she was scum. \u201cGet on to that baptism before you\u2019re late.\u201d Maybe she should ask if Gail would be back tomorrow, but she couldn\u2019t take another blow. Not today.</p><p>\u201cBeen steady business all day.\u201d Gail\u2019s voice drifted from the back room as she retrieved her purse. She reappeared, a tall, slim woman slightly older than Linda. She started to walk past, then shook her head. \u201cHoney, I\u2019ve never seen anyone look so in need of a hug.\u201d She wrapped her arms around Linda and squeezed, then stepped back.</p><p>\u201cI...I did need that. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d The gray-green eyes hardened. \u201cMy Cindy was assaulted when she was sixteen. The scumbag\u2019s lawyer tried to make it sound like she\u2019d asked for it, and thank God, the prosecutor flattened him good. But I got a good education in warped thinking. So maybe you like your sex on the kinky side, but that\u2019s not asking for rape any more than Cindy\u2019s wearing sexy clothes. That\u2019s how I see it. Now buck up.\u201d She gave Linda a firm nod and strode out of the store.</p><p>Linda stared after her. \u201cWell.\u201d She\u2019d misread Gail\u2019s expression completely. Had she been retreating from people without needing to?</p><p>On the drive to the store, she\u2019d wondered again if she even wanted to stay in the town. But she loved her beach shop, loved the gulls strutting along the boardwalk, the quiet sound of the waves, and the chattering of the tourists. Loved the way their sunburned faces brightened at seeing the unique handcrafted souvenirs. She\u2019d worked too hard to get the store going. She and the children had painted the walls. A friend had designed the sign. Her craftspeople relied on her to sell their goods.</p><p>Her chin rose. This was her place, and she wouldn\u2019t give anyone\u2014especially Dwayne\u2014the satisfaction of knowing they\u2019d driven her out. I\u2019m staying.</p><p>That afternoon, she bent her efforts to being the most welcoming shopkeeper on the beachfront and was so successful that it was closing time before she realized it.</p><p>After locking the door and shutting off the lights, she pulled her cell phone out and stared at it. Call the children?</p><p>The longing to hear their voices, to fix the problem, shook her. Her finger hovered over the keypad, then moved away.</p><p>No. They were wrong. No matter how comforting, calling them would demonstrate that they could get away with such behavior.</p><p>They already felt they knew all the answers.</p><p>Speaking of answers, why had Sam answered the way he had? Why did he have to confirm all their suspicions? As bitter anger welled inside her, impossible to set aside, she pulled out her car keys. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Twilight cast shadows over the yard as Sam closed the chickens in their coop for the night. The day had been cloudy, and the evening temperature was in the fifties. After buttoning his denim jacket, he checked his cell phone\u2014no call from Linda. Goddammit. All day, he\u2019d expected her to call.</p><p>He still didn\u2019t know if he should have left the house. Right then, he\u2019d figured she needed time and space to sort things out with the kids. Having him there sure hadn\u2019t helped anything. But what if she\u2019d held firm and kicked the kids out as well? She\u2019d have been alone...after being eviscerated by the brats.</p><p>His mouth tightened. Time and space be damned. He\u2019d call her when he got back to the house.</p> <p>After a quick visual search, he spotted Connagher in the pasture, pouncing on something in the grass. \u201cYou coming, dog?\u201d</p><p>Abandoning the chase, the mountain cur scrambled over the post-and-rail fence, his golden-red fur glinting with the last rays of the sun. His tongue lolled out as he trotted across the yard, ears pricked up to report in. Yes, sir, field mice won\u2019t be bothering you this evening.</p><p>\u201cGood job.\u201d Sam stopped long enough to give him a good rib scratching before heading down the long drive to lock up and turn on the security system.</p><p>The front gate screeched. Sam\u2019s jaw clenched. If that was his ex coming in, he was going to... He heard the car move forward, then another screech as the gate was closed. No, not his ex. Nancy never closed anything behind her.</p><p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d he told Conn as the dog quivered with eagerness to chase the intruder off their land. Protective little bastard. Sam\u2019s father had bred mountain curs, but he\u2019d liked how the dark-brindled dogs could disappear in the night. Liked seeing them scare people. As a child, Sam had experienced his share of frights.</p> <p>Conn\u2019s reddish fur was a damn sight easier to spot.</p><p>As a familiar-looking Toyota sped up the drive, Sam\u2019s spirits rose. Looked like he wouldn\u2019t have to call her after all.</p><p>The car pulled in adjacent to Sam\u2019s truck at the side of the house.</p><p>\u201cHeel,\u201d he said to Conn. He strode forward, the dog a step behind, and opened the door for her. Her scent drifted out, and he had to wonder if lavender would now give him a hard-on every time he smelled it. \u201cCome to visit?\u201d</p><p>She slid out of the car, slammed the door, and then shoved him back a pace. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d If her voice had been a whip, it would have drawn blood.</p><p>Conn growled, and even as Sam snapped, \u201cShut it,\u201d Linda glared at the dog. \u201cGo sit.\u201d</p> <p>With a whine\u2014attacked by two pack leaders at once\u2014Conn put his ass on the ground.</p><p>Sam eyed Linda. The redhead\u2019s temper didn\u2019t fire up quickly, but damn, she was cute when she got angry. He set his hand on the car roof and leaned in, deliberately invading her space. \u201cYou\u2019re pissed off at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t that observant?\u201d The sarcasm was thick even before she added, \u201cHave you considered suing your brains for nonsupport?\u201d</p><p>Now that sounded just like Gabi. Sam barely managed to smother a laugh. No wonder Marcus enjoyed his little submissive so much. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said...you told Charles, \u2018None of your business.\u2019\u201d She scowled. \u201cYou might just as well have said yes. So yeah, thanks for helping out.\u201d</p><p>Ah. His temper started to rise, and he shut it down. She\u2019d had a crappy day and wanted to take it out on him. Not fair, but still good she trusted him enough to do that. Even better that she gave enough of a damn to be angry with him. But she was out of line. \u201cLinda.\u201d Risking another shove, he cupped her chin. \u201cYou really want a man who\u2019d lie? Does that set a good example for your kids?\u201d</p><p>She froze as if he\u2019d slapped her, and tried to turn her face away.</p><p>Not going to happen. His fingers tightened, and he watched her anger fade.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Her voice was barely audible above the sighing of the dogwood trees lining the drive. She closed her eyes and sagged against the car.</p><p>He waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking, coming here to give you grief for being honest.\u201d</p><p>Such big brown eyes. She was a heartbreaker. He gathered her in. \u201cYou needed someone, and you can\u2019t yell at the children\u2014not more than you did already.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I kicked them out of my house.\u201d</p><p>So she\u2019d held to her course. Strong woman. \u201cGood. They were brats.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened for a second, then sighed. \u201cThey were. But they\u2019re usually good kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. Not after this.\u201d Her breathing hitched.</p><p>\u201cNah. Right now, they\u2019re mad. It hit them where they\u2019re vulnerable\u2014the opinion of their friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d she said under her breath.</p><p>Hell. Her kids wouldn\u2019t have been the only ones to read that goddamned paper. He gripped her arms. \u201cAre people giving you a rough time?\u201d</p><p>LINDA STARED UP into Sam\u2019s lean, weathered face. His blue eyes blazed. He should have been furious with the way she\u2019d attacked him, but only now was he showing anger. Protective, wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>Her mouth tilted up as she remembered her afternoon. \u201cSome. Some were snoopy, some rude. But quite a few were angry on my behalf.\u201d She\u2019d collected more hugs that had almost reduced her to crying again. Odd how disconcerting kindness could be.</p><p>\u201cHard day. C\u2019mere.\u201d His arms came around her, and he engulfed her in warmth again.</p><p>As the cooling air brought the scents of the pasture and barn, she heard the low flap of bats catching insects in the air and the rustle of a breeze through the leaves. A cow mooed. She closed her eyes, knowing she could happily spend an eternity in his arms. Who\u2019d ever think the tough rancher could give such fantastic hugs? With a sigh of regret, she pulled back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have bothered you. I\u2019ll get out of your hair now.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his hip against the car door. \u201cNope. You\u2019re here. Now you stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t... I didn\u2019t mean to just barge in.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a hard look. \u201cBe quiet. You\u2019re staying.\u201d</p><p>Her unhappiness drifted back a few feet. Being with Sam would be nice. Her house was empty. Silent. \u201cI... Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I cook you dinner to make up for my being an idiot?\u201d What kind of extra-special dessert could she concoct for him?</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d He nodded at the dog. \u201cThat\u2019s Connagher. Conn\u201d\u2014he slapped Linda\u2019s leg\u2014\u201cthis is Linda. Linda. Linda.\u201d</p><p>The dog rose, sniffed her leg, and wagged its tail.</p><p>Sam glanced at Linda. \u201cHe keeps track of people. Comes in handy when I want to find a field hand.\u201d He tugged on the dog\u2019s ears. \u201cNow, say hello to Linda.\u201d</p><p>The dog barked once, then gave her a canine grin. She bent to pet him. Interesting appearance. Medium-short, rough fur, stocky body, ears that drooped at the tip. His frame was smaller than a lab\u2019s but similar. \u201cWhat kind of dog is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasic hound. Called a mountain cur.\u201d He ruffled the fur on the dog\u2019s neck affectionately. \u201cThey\u2019re working and hunting dogs. Helped settle the Appalachians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d She smiled as she straightened. Conn was like Sam: hard body, no frills, no particular charm, but tough enough to do whatever he had to do.</p><p>Sam put his hand on the small of her back, a circle of warmth in the cooling night, and guided her around the side of the house. In the front, the drive made a circle, enclosing a splashing fountain and landscaping plants. Through the twilight, she could see the shapes of farm buildings. Farther out, white fencing divided up dark pastures and ended at a line of trees.</p><p>The white, two-story farmhouse was probably mid-last century but well kept. A wide porch held a hanging swing and Adirondack chairs. He took her up the steps, across the porch, and through a heavy front door with an arched stained-glass window.</p><p>In the small entry, he helped her off with her white wool coat and hung it up. As he tossed his jean jacket onto a hook, then pulled off his boots, she had to shake her head. As a teen, she\u2019d adored cowboy movies. Sam Davies was like a fantasy come true.</p><p>When he jerked his chin toward her high heels, she removed them before following him into the family room.</p><p>\u201cOh, this is nice.\u201d An interior wall had been removed, letting the huge room flow into the dining area. The pale cream paneling lightened the heaviness of the brown suede sectional couch and chairs. A dark hardwood floor gleamed under a faded Oriental carpet. The entire room was designed for comfort, right down to the small fire crackling in the massive stone fireplace on the right.</p><p>When Conn flopped down on the hearth with a sigh as if he\u2019d battled all day, Linda grinned.</p><p>Sam ran his hand up her back. \u201cYou\u2019ve had dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, always, until... Well, the last one died a few months ago.\u201d Her heart wrenched. \u201cHe was old. And it was good that he didn\u2019t...he wasn\u2019t...\u201d Wasn\u2019t there to be left alone after she\u2019d been abducted.</p><p>Sam squeezed her shoulder in wordless comfort, then left her to walk into the kitchen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unsure what to do, she curled into a corner of the oversize couch. \u201cI can\u2019t stay long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have tomorrow off?\u201d He reappeared with a glass of wine for her and a beer for himself.</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d She took a tiny sip of wine, pleased he\u2019d paid attention to her schedule. But she couldn\u2019t stay...could she?</p><p>He dropped down beside her and put his arm along the back of the couch. Just as when they watched movies at her place, his fingers curled over her shoulder, pulling her closer. \u201cRelax. You don\u2019t have anything or anyone to worry about here.\u201d</p> <p>No neighbors, no spray painter, no newspapers or rude reporters. Paradise. She took a bigger drink. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable. I feel as if I pushed my way in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t want you here, I\u2019d say so.\u201d</p><p>Bluntly instruct someone to go home? Yes, he\u2019d probably do just that. She stared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He curled her hair around his finger.</p><p>\u201cI just realized how honest you are. Even to the point of being rude.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point in lying?\u201d</p><p>Note to self: never ask this man if a dress makes me look fat. But such honesty was oddly freeing. She could relax, knowing she really was welcome. And she\u2019d never have to wonder if he had agreed to something just to be nice.</p><p>His hand curved over her shoulder, and he frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re knotted up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll trade you back rubs.\u201d</p><p>A back rub? She really could use one.</p> <p>\u201cHang on a minute.\u201d He walked out of the room, returning with a jar of coconut oil.</p><p>\u201cYou had a bad day too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like yours. Got in a hay delivery, and the bales are heavy.\u201d His eyes crinkled. \u201cI\u2019m not as young as I used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that happens.\u201d All too soon. At least redheads didn\u2019t go gray as quickly as brunettes. Her sister had colored her hair for over a decade now.</p><p>Sam motioned to Conn. \u201cMove, dog.\u201d</p><p>With a disgruntled look, Conn trotted off to lie in the entryway.</p><p>Sam tossed a quilt from the back of the couch onto the floor, then pulled Linda to her feet. Efficiently, he stripped off her blouse and bra, taking a moment to fondle her.</p><p>Arousal speared downward so quickly she made a sound. Who knew that standing in a room half-naked and having her breasts handled could be so hot?</p> <p>Smiling, he gave her a slow, thorough kiss. \u201cYou\u2019re goddamned tempting, you know. Especially these.\u201d Her breasts sat comfortably cupped in his palms.</p><p>She liked her body, but compliments like that made her feel all warm and fuzzy. After taking another kiss, he pushed her to lie facedown on the quilt.</p><p>On his knees, he straddled her, resting his jean-covered butt on hers. After warming the oil, he started off with long, easy strokes up and down her back. Her eyes slid shut as his greased hands moved over her shoulders. \u201cOoooohhhh. More.\u201d</p><p>He huffed a laugh and continued. When she\u2019d melted right into the blanket, his fingers started to massage each muscle, one by one, working their way up her back. When he reached her tight shoulders, he traced around a taut place. His thumb came down on the knot...and kept pressing harder. She squeaked as the hurting grew.</p><p>\u201cBreathe through it, girl.\u201d</p><p>Ow, ow, ow. More of his weight settled on her butt, pinning her to the blanket. She fought for a breath, took another slower one, before his thumb lifted. As blood rushed into the area with a flood of warmth, she realized the knot was gone. But still... She glared over her shoulder. \u201cThat hurt.\u201d</p><p>He winked. \u201cBest part of giving a massage.\u201d</p><p>Damn sadist.</p><p>He found three more places to torture her with, but by the time he was through, she was incredibly relaxed and turned on as well. Whenever he forced her to take pain\u2014more than she wanted\u2014it had the same effect as if she\u2019d swallowed an instant arousal pill.</p><p>Before she could move, he reached under her, unzipped her slacks, and dragged them and her thong right off.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer my masseuses to be naked.\u201d He stripped off his shirt, set her to one side, and took her place on the quilt.</p><p>She could only laugh and take a perch on his very hard ass. After the coconut oil warmed and liquefied in her palm, she rubbed it over his back. Heavens, just look at him. Broad shoulders, lean musculature, and a tan that showed he sometimes didn\u2019t wear a shirt outside. After massaging his shoulders, she worked her way down. To make any impression in his rock-hard flesh, she had to really work at it. Massage, the newest aerobic exercise. When she reached his low spine, the muscles on each side were like concrete. \u201cHere\u2019s where it hurts, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Push as hard as you can.\u201d</p><p>She edged her bottom back, put all her weight on her palms, and pressed slowly upward. His pleased rumble made her glow inside. She repeated the movement, over and over, but all too soon, her arms tired.</p><p>\u201cUp you go, girl,\u201d he said, obviously feeling her weakening strokes.</p><p>She rose.</p><p>He followed and stretched. \u201cMuch better. You\u2019re good at that, missy.\u201d</p><p>The compliment warmed her. \u201cThank you. You too.\u201d</p><p>With a light laugh, he pulled her forward, rubbing his chest on her breasts and taking her lips in a hard, hard kiss.</p><p>\u201cNow for the more enjoyable part.\u201d He pointed to the quilt. \u201cLie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d She gave him a puzzled look, then dropped to her knees.</p><p>\u201cUh-uh. On your back.\u201d</p><p>Feeling uncomfortably exposed in the bright firelight, she complied. But how come she was naked and he got to keep his pants on?</p><p>As his gaze wandered over her, he smiled, probably enjoying her flush as much as her nakedness. But when he said, \u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful woman,\u201d the temptation to smack him one disappeared.</p><p>He straddled her again, planting himself on her upper thighs, and scooped up more coconut oil. First, he worked on the small muscles in front of her shoulders, in the hollow under her collarbones, and her upper arms. She hadn\u2019t realized those areas could get so tense until he\u2019d turned those muscles to happy noodles.</p><p>Then his eyes grew half-lidded when his hands started to oil her breasts. He massaged the underlying pectoral muscles and started to play. With his gaze on her face, he pulled at her nipples, then pinched lightly. Harder. He rolled each peak between his thumb and forefinger, increasing the pressure until she made a sound.</p><p>\u201cHurts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, darn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He squeezed harder.</p><p>As the pain grew and heat bloomed in her core, she moaned.</p><p>Delight lit his eyes. He didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too hard.\u201d She reached up to push him away.</p><p>\u201cDid I hear your safe word?\u201d He grabbed her wrists, set them above her head, and anchored them in his fist, then continued torturing her breasts with his other hand.</p><p>His grip was too tight, hurting her, and he was pinching her nipples too hard. When she started to squirm\u2014half with pain, half with arousal\u2014he only laughed, continuing until her breasts felt incredibly swollen and throbbed.</p><p>As he rose to his feet, he gave her a stern look. \u201cDon\u2019t move from where I put you.\u201d</p><p>Needing to rub the ache, she lowered her arms, and received a stinging slap on one breast. Ow ow ow. Tears filled her eyes as she hastily put her arms back in place.</p><p>His eyebrows lifted. \u201cSafe word?\u201d</p><p>Pain was rolling through her, yet...despite her tears, she loved it. Her body flamed with arousal. The very roughness he showed her created shivers deep in her belly.</p><p>His lips quirked. \u201cGuess not.\u201d He stripped out of his remaining clothes, and she was mesmerized by how the firelight flickered over his body. He had the tight, flat butt and great legs of a horseman. His shoulders rippled with muscle\u2014from lifting hay bales? He sure didn\u2019t get his physique from a gym. It was a treat to see him in the light.</p><p>His cock was fully erect and seemed just like the rest of Sam\u2014straight, solid, potent. Veins curved around the rigid shaft, inviting a tongue to trace them. Her fingers twitched, wanting to touch.</p><p>He pulled her legs apart and knelt between them. After positioning square cushions on each side of her hips, he bent and pressed her knees to the pillows, opening her to his gaze. With his hands on her thighs to keep her in place, he looked down, studying her private areas with a slight smile.</p><p>Maybe all this light wasn\u2019t so wonderful. He was embarrassing the heck out of her, and she squirmed in response.</p><p>His grip tightened on her knees. \u201cStay put.\u201d</p><p>She froze obediently, but his frown continued. After a second, he took two coasters from the end table and balanced one on each knee. \u201cIf one of these falls because you move, I\u2019ll whip that pretty pussy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d A crease deepened in his cheek as he ran a finger from her knee down to her groin, making her muscles quiver. He nodded to a wooden crate beside the couch. \u201cI just finished making a short, softer flogger. A coaster hits the ground, and I get to try it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d She really, really remembered the paddle he\u2019d used. But a flogger?</p><p>\u201cOh, I would.\u201d He slid down until his mouth hovered over her, and his breath wafted against her mound. \u201cI like blindfolds on submissives, but I think you might not enjoy that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After being a slave? \u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll blindfold yourself.\u201d He lifted his chin, his voice darkening. \u201cPut an arm over your eyes, girl.\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran through her, but she closed her eyes and buried her face in the angle of her elbow.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll do.\u201d He didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t speak. Gave her nothing to listen to.</p><p>In the silent room with only the sounds of the crackling fire\u2014and her pulse in her ears\u2014she waited. With each second, the air grew thicker, her skin more sensitive. Her nipples had bunched so tightly that they throbbed with each beat of her heart. \u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo talking, moaning, screaming. Use your safe word if you need it. Otherwise no noise. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Afraid to say anything, she stayed silent, and his chuckle was low and definitely sadistic.</p><p>But despite\u2014because of?\u2014his rules, she felt liberated. During sex, she always worried she wasn\u2019t responsive enough, that she should moan or wiggle or talk more. But Sam had removed that worry. She wasn\u2019t to do anything.</p><p>His hands curved under her bottom, the palms hard, the thumbs stroking in the crease between her hip and pussy.</p><p>Her instinctive jump made the coasters wobble, and she stilled immediately. Don\u2019t move. When he squeezed her ass cheeks mercilessly, his strength was frightening\u2014and shockingly erotic. He shifted his weight and pulled back, leaving her buttocks aching.</p><p>Don\u2019t move. Don\u2019t speak. Her thoughts fragmented until only anticipation remained. When his breath warmed her flesh, her stomach muscles tightened.</p><p>He licked up and over her pussy, and as his velvety, wet tongue curled around her clit, she barely smothered a whimper. She was so, so ready. He focused there, licking and teasing, until every slide of his tongue brought her closer. Heat streamed through her, hotter than the warmth from the fireplace.</p><p>SAM LIFTED HIS head to study Linda, pleased at how quickly she\u2019d reached the state he wanted her in. Her gorgeous tits rose and fell, showing how close she was to panting. Almost there.</p><p>But he damned well wanted to try out his flogger on her pussy, which meant she needed to move. And she wasn\u2019t. Determined little woman.</p><p>He needed to shut her brain right down without really hurting her. That would be cheating. So he\u2019d drive her a tad higher, make that orgasm shake her good\u2014and knock the coasters off. Slowly, he stroked a finger up and down between her slick folds, then pressed his middle finger inside. She contracted around him in a way that showed she was completely on board with his plan. He pumped her, fast, slow, then added another finger, feeling her stretch around him. His dick tightened to fucking discomfort. He wanted to take her, but damned if he didn\u2019t need to torture her a bit.</p><p>Her hips started to rise, but she regained control.</p><p>Circle the outside of her cunt. Plunge in hard and hear her strained inhalation. Feel her thigh muscles grow tighter. See the shininess appear on her upper lip as she breaks into a sweat. Holding his fingers deep inside her, he growled, \u201cDon\u2019t move, girl.\u201d</p><p>At the hard order, her cunt clenched around him, and he grinned. Goddamn, he loved playing with submissives. Propped on an elbow, he reached up and grabbed a nipple, pinching hard, rolling hard, hearing her almost silent whine. With his arm resting on her soft stomach, he licked over her clit again and felt her begin to quiver.</p><p>Would she be able to maintain when he got her off? He looked up. The coasters perched on her knees were shaking with her tiny movements. Nope.</p><p>Abandoning her breast, he thrust in and out of her pussy. Two fingers, then three, then one, then three. Her clit was so engorged it strained up toward his flicking tongue.</p><p>He backed off, lifted his head, and removed his fingers.</p><p>Yep, that was a definite whine, no matter how soft. Her jaw was clenched. She held herself rigid as her arousal faded.</p><p>He waited...waited...then licked hard over her clit, over and over, bringing her back up. Very, very slowly, he slid his fingers back into her cunt. Her panting had changed to gasps. Goddamn, this was fun.</p> <p>Her face was flushed, and he regretted not being able to watch her eyes. But she needed to work through some of the lingering triggers left by the slavers. He\u2019d take his time, not push her too fast, but eventually, she\u2019d be clear of their crap.</p><p>He gave her clit a break as he curved his fingers to find her G-spot. Ah, not far inside the entrance, and roughed up with plumpness. She didn\u2019t react with his first rub or the second, so he increased the pressure, massaging firmly, and her cunt jerked tightly around him as if startled awake.</p><p>He kept stroking, added small licks at erratic intervals to her clit, and heard her breathing turn erratic as well.</p><p>Close. Very close. Time for a break. He stopped everything and pulled his fingers out. Her frustration built visibly as he counted her breaths. One...five...fifteen. On twenty, he rammed two fingers in, rubbing her G-spot hard and fast.</p><p>Her back arched, and she let out a squeak before smothering it. A coaster wobbled and slid off her knee, hitting the quilt with a soft thump. Her whimper held both despair...and anticipation.</p><p>Satisfaction sizzled through him. The little masochist wanted to know what his whip felt like, and he was definitely of a mind to show her. \u201cDamn, missy, looks like you get that pussy flogged.\u201d</p><p>He set the coaster back on her knee. \u201cKeep still and I\u2019ll give you only five. Lose another coaster, it\u2019ll be more.\u201d The husky sound of her fear did his sadist\u2019s heart good. He took the miniflogger from the crate and gave her pussy a light flick.</p><p>Both coasters fell off.</p><p>THE EXQUISITE AGONY burst over her like a wave of flames. Oh my God. Linda shook, unsure when the pain had turned to pleasure\u2014unsure if it had. She realized her knees were clamped together, and she\u2019d also uncovered her eyes. Gasping for air, she stared up at Sam.</p><p>He was grinning, an evil grin that let her know he wasn\u2019t about to stop. And his enjoyment was horribly erotic.</p><p>But if he hit her with that thing again, she\u2019d die.</p><p>He studied her for a minute, then shook his head. \u201cA bit too much for you just yet.\u201d He pulled something else out of the crate. \u201cI\u2019ll use this instead. Since you got more than five coming.\u201d</p><p>The whimper that escaped her was humiliating. The crease in his cheek deepened.</p><p>He held a narrow rectangle of reinforced leather. She started to panic at how much it looked like a belt, but then realized it seemed to have the thickness and texture of a tripled piece of suede. Soft?</p><p>\u201cLegs open, girl.\u201d</p><p>Dear sweet heaven. It took an effort to open herself back up and rest her knees on the thick pillows.</p><p>He bent and ran his fingers over her pussy, making her wiggle. \u201cNot too bad. You\u2019re just pink.\u201d</p><p>Oh well, that\u2019s nice. Although she bit back the words, the sun lines at the corners of his eyes deepened.</p><p>He straightened, and then the suede slashed down, hitting her left labia. The blast of sensation made her gasp, then moan as it flared into bliss.</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d He watched her for a second, and she could feel sweat on her neck. Everything inside her tightened as he forced her to wait.</p><p>He let fly with five more swats, alternating to the right and left of her clit, the last landing directly on top.</p><p>The world flashed red as shocking, thick pleasure scalded her whole pussy. \u201cAaah!\u201d Her clit seemed to expand as the pressure boiled higher and higher.</p><p>Shoving her legs open with his feet\u2014when had she moved them?\u2014he whipped the strap against her right inner thigh, then her left, hard enough that the burn shook her.</p><p>Before she could move, he went down on one knee. Using his fingers, he scissored her labia open, and with his hand, he administered three more stinging swats directly to her clit.</p><p>Everything inside her surged upward, the pain knotting into hard pleasure, shoving her so, so close. Tears streamed from her eyes, and she hurt, and it was wonderful, but she couldn\u2019t...couldn\u2019t get there.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, studying her face, her clenched hands, her breathing. His satisfaction with her response was obvious.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, hating herself. Needing more. Hating that she couldn\u2019t keep the word back.</p><p>His brows drew together, and his warm, calloused hands massaged her thighs. Gently. \u201cLinda, don\u2019t be ashamed to ask your Dom to let you come. It\u2019s what he wants.\u201d His deep, focused eyes met hers, held hers. His voice was rough with the truth he wanted her to absorb.</p><p>Then he bent his head and closed his mouth over her clit. His tongue, hot and flat, rubbed over the still-stinging flesh, and the feeling was indescribable as everything inside her tightened. Tightened again.</p><p>With a rumble of enjoyment, he closed his lips around her and sucked hard, hard, hard, even as he plunged two fingers inside her. One thrust, two.</p><p>Her breathing halted completely as the avalanche struck. Unstoppable, it ripped everything free, hit bottom, and exploded into brilliance. Ecstasy tore upward through her, and electricity sheeted across every brain cell she owned.</p><p>My sweet heavens. She hauled in a shaky breath. Even as her body jerked with tiny aftershocks, he rubbed his cock against her entrance...and pressed in. He was much thicker than his fingers, and her labia were so swollen that the sliding scrape of his entry sent her into a long, rolling orgasm again.</p><p>His laugh was deep, more gravelly than normal, and his eyes gleamed into hers. \u201cI\u2019m going to take you hard, girl. Are you ready?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded. Braced on one hand, he captured her wrists with the other and set them above her head. Again. Her shoulders twinged, not in a good way. Getting decrepit, Linda.</p><p>After studying her for a long moment, he pulled her arms down. \u201cThis time, keep your arms around me.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t ask for anything finer than being allowed to touch him. As her palms traced out the hills and valleys of his hard back muscles, the knowledge of his strength made her bones go soft.</p><p>He started slowly, pulling almost all the way out before slamming into her. The shock wave set off little convulsions again. As he went faster, his face grew tighter and the cords stood out on his neck.</p> <p>His gaze met hers, his eyes hot. \u201cMore.\u201d Bracing himself on one arm, he put his elbow under her knee and lifted her leg up. The next thrust was far deeper.</p><p>As he hammered into her, the erotically satisfying feeling of being positioned for his use swept through her. Take me as you want.</p><p>He rested his forehead against hers, his body stiffened with release, and his groan was low and rumbling and beautiful.</p><p>She pulled him closer, cherishing the knowledge of pleasing him. She wanted to give him everything. Her eyes closed for a moment. God, God, she shouldn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014fall for this man.</p><p>He released her leg and gathered her close, cuddling her to him in that disconcertingly tender way he had. When he rubbed his cheek against hers, his face softer than she\u2019d ever seen it, she knew she was in trouble.</p> <p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The next morning, Sam wakened to the sound of a woman singing. Ice circled his spine, and his jaws clenched so tightly his teeth ground together. Nancy. How had she gotten in?</p><p>He rolled out of bed, his feet hitting the floor with a thump. In the bathroom. He yanked open the door. \u201cHow the hell did you get\u2014\u201d</p><p>By the counter, the naked woman spun, turned white, and backed up until she hit the wall. One hand clutched a towel to her chest. Big brown eyes, red hair.</p><p>He\u2019d just scared the crap out of Linda.</p><p>Wake up, Davies, you idiot. He sagged against the door frame. \u201cHell. Sorry.\u201d</p> <p>As color returned to her face, she wrapped the dark blue bath towel around her. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Soft voice. Firm. Expecting an answer. There was a downside to involvement with an intelligent, older woman.</p><p>\u201cI woke up and heard singing.\u201d He stopped. There was no way to explain.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like the blues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you were someone else.\u201d He couldn\u2019t go further.</p><p>Her mouth opened in a silent oh. \u201cYour ex-wife.\u201d After securing her towel more firmly, she moved closer and rested her hand on his chest. Brave woman\u2014her breathing was still fast. He\u2019d scared her badly. \u201cShe liked to sing?\u201d</p><p>The memories of Nancy singing were...ugly, and his face tightened, but Linda\u2019s soft hand stayed warm against his skin. \u201cSometimes.\u201d Whenever she was high.</p><p>\u201cWhy would that bother you so much?\u201d Her brows together, she waited, expecting more.</p><p>Why? The short bursts of memories clawed at his gut. How Nancy sang as she shattered Nicole\u2019s soccer trophies. Danced while throwing his grandfather\u2019s carvings into the fireplace. She hadn\u2019t sung for happiness, just destruction. He needed to explain, to erase Linda\u2019s unhappiness, but his jaw was clamped shut.</p> <p>His silence hurt her, and her soft lips trembled before she stepped back. \u201cOh, Sam.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cShe must have given you a horrible time, and I\u2019m sorry. But I can\u2019t stop singing. It\u2019s part of who I am.\u201d</p><p>It was. Music followed her everywhere. He liked that about her. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. Not going to talk about Nancy. Never.</p><p>The little mama came out. \u201cYou should talk to me.\u201d She crossed her arms over her gorgeous breasts. \u201cWe need to discuss this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think so.\u201d As he forced his muscles to relax, he smiled slowly. Seems he had a bossy masochist trapped in his bathroom. Looked like a fine way to improve his mood. \u201cI figure you owe me for starting my day off so badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you?\u201d</p><p>He set her hand on his shoulder. Watching her closely, he bent and slid his fingers down her inner thigh, finding a small welt from the night before. He pressed lightly, enough to hurt. More than that\u2014enough to bring back her memories of how it had happened.</p><p>Her pupils dilated, her fingers on his bare shoulder curved, pulling him closer, as if needing more contact with his skin.</p><p>That he could do. He gathered her in, shoving her towel down in the process so her breasts rubbed against his chest. Her nipples jutted out, two points of extra pressure. \u201cI haven\u2019t had my shower yet,\u201d he murmured in her ear. If he turned the water to ice-cold and held her under it, would she scream? \u201cYou can help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you just a generous guy?\u201d Pink washed into her face as he pressed his erection against her soft lower pelvis. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>A car horn sounded.</p><p>Now? Sam grunted in exasperation.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder at the slightly open window. \u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConstruction crew. Building a new stable.\u201d His arms tightened. \u201cGoddammit.\u201d</p><p>His annoyance lessened at the sound of her husky laugh. She patted his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re just having a heck of a morning, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Linda shifted her weight, smiling as the saddle creaked under her. The soft sounds of hooves on the dirt trail and the rattle of bridles spelled peace in the quiet afternoon. As the trees thinned, the late afternoon sun warmed her shoulders. It had been a lovely day.</p><p>After Sam had returned from opening his gate, he\u2019d cooked her a breakfast of French toast and sausage. Unhealthy carbs and unhealthy fat. When she\u2019d informed him that nothing in the entire meal was good for him, he\u2019d only laughed. Unshaven, rumpled, heavy-eyed from sex and lack of sleep, the man was too sexy for words, even at the breakfast table.</p><p>And in the full light of day? On a dappled gelding, he led the way down the trail. Face it, the man was too sexy, period, and definitely outclassed a stodgy widow in her forties. He might be older than she was, but aside from his gray hair, he sure didn\u2019t show it.</p><p>Must be all the work he did on his place. The horseback tour had led from a huge garden to acres of citrus groves to pastureland for his horses and cattle. The lushly overgrown creekside trail made a sweet finish to the ride.</p><p>As the trail opened up, Sam nudged his horse into a trot, and her horse followed suit. Ouch. Either she\u2019d have to get better at riding, or Sam better stop walloping her bottom and other places that met a saddle. Gritting her teeth, she pulled her horse to a walk.</p><p>After a minute, Sam glanced over his shoulder. Then his slow grin appeared. \u201cBit sore, missy?\u201d</p><p>When she glared at him, he laughed...but waited for her to catch up and stayed at a walking pace. The noise of construction soon filled the air as they neared the house and barns.</p><p>In the corral, Sam dismounted and tied his horse to the fence.</p><p>\u201cWe could have gone longer,\u201d she protested as she swung down.</p><p>When he squeezed her tender bottom and she stiffened, he shook his head. \u201cI like giving you pain, like making you hurt, but not this way. Don\u2019t want you crippled.\u201d</p><p>The man took her breath with his candidness. \u201cDo you tell everyone you\u2019re a sadist?\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cDon\u2019t particularly care if people know, but I don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d He gave her a direct look. \u201cMost people don\u2019t talk about their private business\u2014like what they did in bed the night before. Why would sadists be any different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Guess that was a dumb question.\u201d</p><p>He ran his finger down her cheek. \u201cGot yourself quite a pack of worries, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>As they walked out of the corral, Connagher trotted over. He\u2019d been with them for most of the ride, then disappeared at the creek.</p><p>Sam ruffled the hair on the dog\u2019s neck. \u201cAnything to report?\u201d</p><p>Conn wagged his tail as if in answer.</p><p>Linda tried to stifle her laugh and failed, getting her a raised eyebrow. \u201cYou really do sound like a sergeant sometimes.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cBeen decades, girl.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. But habits picked up as a teenager\u2014or under stress\u2014tended to endure. \u201cRight. So, Sarge, did your four-footed soldier find anything interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it when masochists get impertinent, you know.\u201d</p><p>How could he create that curling of heat with just a few words and a look?</p><p>\u201cDavies.\u201d A skinny construction guy came around the corner of the stable. \u201cGot a minute? The boss wants to check with you about the wiring.\u201d</p><p>Sam hesitated, and Linda patted his arm. \u201cI should be getting back anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spending the night.\u201d</p><p>Her heart wanted to flutter, and she told it no. \u201cAh. Fine. Then I\u2019ll just look around for a bit, okay?\u201d</p><p>He ran his hand down her arm and nodded. \u201cWon\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>Once their talk was concluded, Sam walked with Nolan King to where the contractor had parked. The last of the crew had just driven through the gates, returning the farm to quiet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty woman you got.\u201d Nolan opened his truck door and paused. \u201cShe give up on being normal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting there.\u201d</p><p>King grinned, then swung into his truck.</p><p>After locking the front gate, Sam unsaddled the horses and turned them loose. Immediate tasks finished, he looked around. No redhead in sight. Had she gone up to the house? He whistled for Conn.</p> <p>After a minute, the dog tore across the south pasture, ducked under the fence, and stopped in front of Sam.</p><p>\u201cGood boy.\u201d Sam tossed him a dog treat from his pocket. \u201cFind Linda. Linda.\u201d Conn usually needed longer to associate a name with a scent, but he\u2019d strongly taken to the redhead. \u201cFind Linda.\u201d</p><p>A short bark indicated agreement. The dog did a quick circle of the corral, caught the trail, and headed off, bouncing in happiness at performing his favorite task.</p><p>Sam followed. Looked as if Linda had visited the chickens, checked the pasture, circled the construction, and headed down to the small pond. Partway there, Conn lifted his nose, caught her scent in the air, and gave his triumphant bay of I found her.</p><p>She was sitting on the bank of the pond, watching the ducks and an egret in the shallows. Her hair glinted red in the sun, and her cheeks were sunburned from their ride; he\u2019d need to take care of that. When Conn charged up to her and knocked her backward with his enthusiastic greeting, she simply laughed.</p> <p>The woman laughed in the same way she climaxed\u2014nothing held back, open and delighted. A man could fall for that laugh. Hell.</p><p>She tilted her head back, and the dimple in her cheek appeared. \u201cYou found me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConn did.\u201d Sam dropped down beside her, close enough to tell he liked the scent of his soap on her.</p><p>\u201cWhen you said he kept track of people, I didn\u2019t realize you meant he\u2019d hunt for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole taught him to play hide-and-seek. I took it from there. Working dogs need challenges, or they get into trouble.\u201d</p><p>Linda scratched Conn\u2019s neck in a way that would earn his lifelong devotion. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty proud of himself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d Sam ran his knuckles over her cheek, pink from the sun. \u201cBeen meaning to ask\u2014you on the pill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn implant.\u201d Her mouth twisted. \u201cA gift of the slavers, but I decided to leave it in place.\u201d</p><p>Damn but he disliked raising ugly memories, but these were questions that needed to be asked. Should have done it before. \u201cAs a member of the Shadowlands, I get tested regularly.\u201d And he knew that over the past few months, the ex-slaves had been checked often.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. Then she caught where he was heading. Her lips tilted up. \u201cYou want to skip the condoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh let him relax. Then she tilted her head. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re not...with...anyone else, I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes, missy.\u201d He traced her lips before giving her a level look. \u201cI don\u2019t share.\u201d</p><p>He received the same look back. Damn, he liked this woman. \u201cWe\u2019re on the same page, then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood enough. So there\u2019s time before I need to start evening chores. You have anything you\u2019d like to see or do?\u201d He tugged on a lock of her hair. \u201cI know what I\u2019d prefer\u201d\u2014he smiled as her face flushed\u2014\u201cbut you might need to walk tomorrow.\u201d And, from the way she\u2019d been shifting in the saddle, he knew how sore she was going to be.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The disappointment in her voice and her involuntary wiggle told him she\u2019d be willing anyway.</p><p>He pulled her hair, dragging her until she was on her back in the soft grass. Enthusiasm should be rewarded.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>The cold morning breeze off the Gulf whipped around Sam as he followed Linda into her beachfront store. After yesterday, she was walking a bit stiffly, but although he\u2019d seen her wince off and on, she\u2019d smiled each time. Probably enjoying the memory of how the soreness had occurred.</p><p>His first impression of her store was cheerful clutter, but on closer examination he could see she\u2019d arranged the merchandise to lure a customer in. On one side, two middle-aged women browsed the landscape paintings. A young couple was checking out the stoneware.</p><p>Sam glanced around. Something seemed missing. Ah. \u201cNo shot glasses with palm trees or \u2018Florida\u2019 on the side?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Fraid not. There are plenty of other stores selling the usual souvenirs.\u201d She grinned. \u201cMy cousin collected stuff when she traveled, tiny spoons and shot glasses, and a few years later, she got tired of dusting and gave everything to Goodwill. Tourists should have vacation mementos that are useful as well as fun.\u201d</p><p>He tucked his arm around her. \u201cFine job.\u201d The place even smelled good, reminding him of pumpkin pie. They passed a shelf of candles, then a chest-high wrought-iron candelabrum. He stopped. Be nice to get something for Z and Jessica\u2019s wedding.</p><p>The people by the stoneware were looking around for assistance. Sam gave Linda a quick, hard kiss. \u201cGo help your customers. I\u2019m going to buy a candelabra. See you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She glanced at the couple. \u201cOkay. But next time is my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d As she went to answer questions, Sam hauled his present-to-be to the front. Heavy bastard. The nicely dressed clerk gave him a cheerful greeting. Appeared Linda selected her employees as carefully as she did her merchandise. As the clerk rang up the sale and arranged to package and send the gift, Sam listened to the chatter in the store.</p><p>Linda was giving the young couple a briefing on the various potters\u2019 backgrounds.</p><p>On the left, the older women were gossiping.</p><p>Hearing Linda\u2019s name, he straightened.</p><p>The plump one was whispering, \u201c...she...a slave. I heard she...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she asked for it, didn\u2019t she?\u201d The brassy-haired one drew herself up, looking as self-righteous as a nun.</p><p>Sam\u2019s jaw clenched. If Linda overheard crap like that, no wonder she got frazzled. And her children had shoveled more shit onto the pile.</p><p>\u201c...got what she deserved.\u201d</p><p>He felt a muscle twitch in his cheek. Ripping a person down in her own place? Judging without the facts? And worst of all, for a woman...</p><p>He accepted his receipt from the clerk, nodded at her, and then followed the two old biddies out of the store. Their mean-spirited whispers sounded like snakes slithering through the grass.</p><p>\u201cLadies.\u201d</p><p>They turned, faces pleasant.</p><p>\u201cCould be wrong about that. In my book, a lady doesn\u2019t bad-mouth someone. Especially a woman who already suffered enough.\u201d</p><p>They looked shocked. The brassy one drew herself up again. \u201cHow dare\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really figure any woman asks to be abused?\u201d</p><p>The plump one\u2019s face reddened.</p><p>\u201cYeah. What I thought.\u201d He barely bit back an offer to show them what a whipping felt like. But his face\u2014Dom and sadist\u2014must have spoken for him, since they tripped over each other backing away.</p><p>As he stalked to his truck, they scurried off in the other direction. Hell. He probably hadn\u2019t done Linda any favors, but goddamn.</p><p>He shook his head and started his truck. Then turned it off. Linda\u2019s children had bleated out the same crap, and the brats still hadn\u2019t called to apologize. When she\u2019d checked her phone this morning, he could see their betrayal was eating at her.</p><p>Long as he was on a roll, he might as well enjoy himself.</p><p>Linda leaned back in the booth of the small sandwich shop and smiled at Andrea, Beth, and Jessica. Their lunch was almost over, and she\u2019d finally learned what had brought the three women to Foggy Shores. They were determined to get Linda to attend Jessica\u2019s bachelorette party. \u201cI\u2019m not really part of your group,\u201d Linda said, fighting a losing battle.</p><p>Jessica wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer. Then again, Master Z wouldn\u2019t fall for a pushover.</p><p>Andrea wasn\u2019t any weakling either. The bartender\u2019s submissive had a slight Hispanic accent, was a couple of inches taller than Linda, and was darned determined.</p><p>Although soft-spoken and quiet, Beth was just as stubborn. Lean and fit with dark auburn hair and turquoise eyes, she ran a landscaping business and was probably used to getting her own way. Except maybe with her Dom, who apparently was Sam\u2019s construction contractor.</p><p>\u201cBeing with Sam makes you part of the group. All the trainees and the Masters\u2019 submissives are coming.\u201d Andrea shoved her curly, butterscotch-colored hair behind her ears. \u201cNot any Masters, of course, and not the Mistresses either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMistresses are female,\u201d Linda noted. \u201cWhy not them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Shadowlands Masters and Mistresses stick together. They\u2019d report back.\u201d Andrea grinned. \u201cI sure don\u2019t want Cullen finding out what I do at a bachelorette party, right?\u201d</p><p>Remembering the antics at parties she\u2019d attended, Linda could only nod. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMistress Anne\u2019s Joey was tempted, but he didn\u2019t want to be the only guy.\u201d Beth\u2019s lips curved. \u201cBesides, any party with Gabi and Sally will be insane, and he didn\u2019t want to get in trouble with Anne.\u201d</p><p>Linda ran through the people she\u2019d met at the Shadowlands. \u201cI don\u2019t think I know her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, you\u2019d remember. She\u2019s as scary a sadist as Sam.\u201d Jessica gave a fake shiver and then grinned at Beth\u2019s chiding look. \u201cOh, please. The man\u2019s terrifying. I\u2019m sure Linda\u2019s noticed.\u201d</p><p>Oh, had she. She still carried some bruises. Linda widened her eyes in confusion. \u201cBut Sam is just a sweetie. How could you say that?\u201d And actually, the past couple of days had been wonderful. She\u2019d forgotten what it felt like to have someone there. Just to watch television or talk with while having a glass of wine. Someone to cuddle against in bed.</p><p>Jessica shook her head in admiration. \u201cYou\u2019re so full of it.\u201d Turning sideways, she stole a french fry from Andrea.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just order some?\u201d Andrea asked.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t want to gain weight before my wedding. And everybody knows stolen food has no calories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d Laughing, Andrea pushed her plate into the center of the table to share. \u201cSo, Linda, does Master Sam scare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Sometimes.\u201d Linda eyed the plate. No calories? After taking a fry, she tried to explain further. \u201cIt\u2019s a good scary when we\u2019re playing. I know he\u2019ll push, and that\u2019s a bit frightening, but\u201d\u2014she pressed her hand over the quiver low in her belly\u2014\u201cexciting too.\u201d</p><p>The smiles of understanding she got made her relax. They really did get it.</p><p>\u201cGood word, \u2018exciting,\u2019\u201d Jessica agreed.</p> <p>\u201cBut when he\u2019s mad?\u201d Linda continued. \u201cHe gets this cold...dangerous...look. Sure, I know he\u2019d never hurt me\u2014not in anger\u2014but my body isn\u2019t hearing logic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, that\u2019s how I feel when Nolan\u2019s angry,\u201d Beth said. \u201cAnd I want to hide under the bed, only he sees that and really gets mad, because he hates it when he scares me, even though my reaction\u2019s just instinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Linda tilted her head. \u201cWere you one of the kidnapped women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I had an abusive husband,\u201d Beth said.</p><p>Jessica glanced at Linda. \u201cHe was a real psycho sadist. Makes you appreciate how careful and controlled ours are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOurs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Doms in the Shadowlands.\u201d Jessica leaned back with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m so full I\u2019ll probably fall asleep at my computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, exciting life, playing with numbers.\u201d Andrea grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve got a couple more places to clean this afternoon, so I\u2019d better get moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have fruit trees to plant.\u201d Beth looked at Linda. \u201cThis weekend...it\u2019ll be really, really fun.\u201d</p><p>Fun with a bunch of women who were submissive like her yet assertive as all get-out. \u201cI\u2019d love to join you.\u201d</p><p>Near suppertime, Sam walked into a small diner near the University of South Florida and saw Linda\u2019s children had shown up. Probably not because they wanted to cooperate with his instructions, but because they needed someone to fight with.</p><p>If they took him on, he\u2019d have to figure they hadn\u2019t inherited their mother\u2019s brains.</p><p>A half-full iced tea sat in front of the girl, a can of Pepsi in front of the boy. Looked as if they\u2019d been there awhile.</p><p>When he slid into the booth across from them, the girl startled. The boy managed to suppress his reaction...somewhat.</p> <p>Sam leaned back and studied them. They had their mother\u2019s rich brown eyes. Brenna had Linda\u2019s figure. Charles had her nose and determined chin. His anger increased. Her own blood was destroying her. Refusing to speak with her. Calling her names.</p><p>As his silence continued, Brenna shifted uneasily in her seat.</p><p>Charles\u2019s mouth was tight; his fingers around the can were white-knuckled. \u201cYou wanted to speak to us, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Your mother talks about you, you know. She\u2019s proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Charles answered. \u201cYeah, well we\u2019re not proud of her, the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I bust your jaw, she\u2019ll be pissed off at me,\u201d Sam said mildly. \u201cI\u2019m a sadist. I\u2019d enjoy seeing you suck your meals through a straw.\u201d Actually, it would bother the hell out of him.</p><p>The boy turned white. When the girl started to slide out, Sam set his boot on the seat beside her, blocking her escape. \u201cLet\u2019s be polite here. I\u2019ll have my say. You do the same. We\u2019ll be done.\u201d He nailed her with a look that made most people cower.</p><p>She cringed, then raised her chin. \u201cGo on, then.\u201d Like her mama, the girl had guts.</p><p>\u201cSmart girl. First, let me see if I got my facts right. Your dad died when you were little. Your mom ran the store to make money, raised you both, and used his life insurance money to pay for your tuitions. She covers your rent every month.\u201d He set his gaze on the boy. \u201cShe works hard for you. What do you do for her, besides calling her names?\u201d</p><p>Charles scowled harder as if to cover up his guilt. \u201cWe help her with stuff at the house. Yard work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe watched the house while she was gone,\u201d Brenna offered. Her frown said she saw the imbalance.</p><p>A waitress walked up. \u201cWhat can I get you folks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back in ten minutes,\u201d Sam growled.</p><p>With a gulp, she retreated.</p><p>Yeah, he might still be a tad angry. So were the children. In fact, Brenna\u2019s expression was a duplicate of Nicole\u2019s when she was pissed off at him. His daughter wasn\u2019t a brat, and these two didn\u2019t seem like brats either. But if they weren\u2019t and considering what Linda went through, why the hell were they acting like this?</p><p>From ignorance? He rubbed his jaw. How much did they know of what she\u2019d been through? Many of the trials had been conducted in closed courtroom sessions. The violently graphic details\u2014especially for the victims who\u2019d lived\u2014had been withheld from the press. \u201cWhat did your mother tell you about what happened to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe read the papers. We know.\u201d Charles turned a dark red. \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Hell. She\u2019d kill him for clueing her kids in. \u201cYou understand she was raped.\u201d</p><p>Brenna\u2019s chin lifted. \u201cBut she likes\u2014\u201d</p><p>He slapped the table, shutting her up. \u201cThere\u2019s a goddamn difference between kinky games with someone you like and...\u201d Don\u2019t yell at them, Davies. \u201cIf I strip you, dump you in the slums, and let every lowlife there take a turn, that\u2019s rape...and that\u2019s what your mother endured.\u201d</p><p>Both kids turned white.</p><p>\u201cYour mama has scars on her back. Not from fun, but from a bastard ripping the skin open with a whip.\u201d</p><p>Brenna\u2019s breath hitched; Charles was silent.</p><p>\u201cShe befriended a girl your age, Brenna.\u201d He gave them an even look. \u201cYou know your mom. She\u2019s a mother to everybody, right?\u201d</p><p>The kids nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe girl was sold and then beaten to death.\u201d His belly still turned over at the thought. \u201cYour mom cries for her. She testified against the man and came out of the courtroom as shocky as if she\u2019d had her guts ripped out.\u201d Dammit, Linda, you should have shared some of this.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know,\u201d Charles whispered.</p><p>Sam snorted. \u201cYour mother protected you all her life. She wanted to be strong for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe went to Aunt Wendy\u2019s. And she looked horrible when she left.\u201d Brenna glanced at Charles. \u201cBut then we thought it was, like, a vacation. Only it wasn\u2019t, was it? She said it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Her hand covered her mouth. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t believe her.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d pushed, Linda had grudgingly shared some with him. \u201cShe had panic attacks. Was throwing up a few times a day. Screaming her way out of nightmares. Going through counseling. Hysterical one day, depressed and suicidal the next. Hell of a vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mommy...\u201d When Brenna burst into tears, Sam forgave her. But the little bastard hadn\u2019t said a word, was staring out the window.</p><p>Sam\u2019s hand fisted, and then he saw tears rolling down the kid\u2019s cheek. He\u2019d clenched his jaw...and his chin was quivering. Macho boy had a tender heart, after all.</p><p>Job almost done. Wrap it up. \u201cSo. Your mama might like sex with a side dish of kink, but doesn\u2019t mean she asked for any of that.\u201d He rose. Add a threat if they gave her any more trouble? No, they looked shell-shocked. \u201cCall her. She\u2019s had enough grief. Doesn\u2019t need it from the ones who are supposed to love her.\u201d</p><p>When they both flinched, he slapped the table in satisfaction and walked away.</p><p>As he strode down the street, he pondered his next problem. How was he going to keep Linda from killing him when she learned he\u2019d given her children a come-to-Jesus talk?</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Linda parked her car in the small parking area at the side of Sam\u2019s house and got out, disappointed his truck wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>After greeting her with a quick lick of her fingers, Connagher returned to his front porch perch. Sam had said the dog \u201csupervised\u201d from there.</p><p>The construction crew was still working on the stable. Leaving her purse in the car, Linda wandered over to watch. They were amazing\u2014like a choreographed musical with the dancers wearing jeans and T-shirts. Piece by piece, she could see the building coming together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou must be Linda.\u201d A rough voice came from behind her.</p><p>She spun. A huge, dark-faced, scarred man loomed far too close, and she stumbled back. Run! Even as she recognized him as one of the construction crew, the icy fear refused to abate, forcing her to retreat another step. She couldn\u2019t think\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nolan. Saw you at the club.\u201d He stood with Sam\u2019s quiet patience. His face even held the same \u201cpanic if you need to, I\u2019ll wait\u201d expression.</p><p>The club? Of course. The subs at the Shadowlands had pointed him out. Her heart slowed to a mild gallop as she realized this was the Dom she\u2019d said would step over a person\u2019s body without looking back. Up close, he was even more intimidating. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You startled me and I\u2014\u201dWas afraid you were a slaver. Um, not a polite thing to say.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not one of the bad guys, although my wife might disagree at times.\u201d His grin came and went so fast she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d seen it. \u201cBeth said she was going to have lunch with you today.\u201d</p><p>Just shoot me now. Beth had even said her husband was the contractor here. Linda smiled and held out her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>He shook her hand gently. Like Sam, he seemed very aware of his strength.</p><p>And like Sam, he didn\u2019t feel obligated to hold up his side of a conversation. At a loss, she said, \u201cSo you belong to Beth?\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth turned up. \u201cI see it as the other way around.\u201d</p> <p>Linda felt herself turn red. The guy was a Dom. Duh, Linda.</p><p>To her relief, Sam pulled his truck in beside her car and got out.</p><p>Her heart lifted higher as each of his long strides brought him closer.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you this soon,\u201d he said. She had a moment of worry that he wasn\u2019t happy to see her before he yanked her onto her toes for a kiss. Hard hands, demanding lips.</p><p>Her body slid into meltdown.</p><p>After tucking her against his side, he gave his dog a quick pat and greeted Nolan. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p> <p>Nolan\u2019s gaze touched her. He looked as if he was almost smiling before he answered Sam, \u201cAhead of schedule.\u201d He checked his watch and turned to yell at his crew, \u201cDay\u2019s over. Finish up.\u201d</p><p>The cheers made the horses in the pasture trot to the far end.</p><p>Nolan turned back to tell Sam. \u201cLeft your paint in the old barn.\u201d After nodding to Linda, he rejoined his gang.</p><p>She shook her head. A woman who\u2019d been abused married to that scary-looking man. Beth was braver than she looked.</p><p>Sam curved his hand over her hip. \u201cI\u2019d like a beer, a meal, and sex...not in that order.\u201d</p><p>When his grip increased to the point of pain, she gasped, feeling everything shiver and loosen inside. \u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>His eyes crinkled. \u201cYeah, we could go straight to sex.\u201d</p><p>Her heart acquired the same rat-tat rhythm as the nail gun. \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuppose?\u201d He yanked her head back, holding her easily so she stared up into his light eyes. \u201cTry again, missy. You might start begging now.\u201d</p><p>Beg? Never. Ever. A nasty buzz like a million bees stung the insides of her head. \u201cSlut, you want food? Beg for it.\u201d As coldness shot through her, she struggled against his grip.</p><p>Sam released her hair instantly. His other hand lay lightly on her shoulder. Not gripping. Palm open. Warm. \u201cLinda. Settle.\u201d His level, patient eyes caught hers.</p><p>As the buzzing in her head decreased and died away, she shuddered.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d He put one finger under her chin and tilted her head up. \u201cBad reaction. What set you off?\u201d</p><p>The lack of emotion in his voice helped dispel the last of her fear and fury and even smoothed away some of her embarrassment at overreacting. \u201cI...don\u2019t like the word. Beg.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows, a shade darker than his steel-gray hair, lifted in inquiry. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Overseer\u201d\u2014the slaver Kim called a scum sucker\u2014\u201cmade us beg for everything. To eat. To use the bathroom. To stand up. Sit down. For light.\u201d</p><p>Sam growled. \u201cAnd if you didn\u2019t beg, he\u2019d hurt you. If you did, it would never be enough.\u201d</p><p>He knew. Understood. She closed her eyes and nodded.</p><p>He gathered her into his arms, rocked her back and forth. \u201cRough time, girl.\u201d</p><p>She melted into him. He didn\u2019t have a smooth tongue, but the comfort he offered was unsurpassed anywhere. His left palm kept her firmly against him; his other hand massaged the muscles on each side of her spine, loosening the knots.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good trigger word to have, though.\u201d He pulled back and cupped her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll work on getting you past that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Lovely. \u201cDo all Doms try to fix things?\u201d</p><p>The lines fanning out from the corners of his eyes deepened. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>With a huff of exasperation, she walked with him to the house. In pickups and cars, the construction workers were streaming down the drive. The one at the end gave a honk-honk, and then quiet settled over the farm.</p><p>Conn stopped them for a minute to gather pets, then loped toward the pasture.</p><p>Linda glanced at Sam. \u201cWhat\u2019s he up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was on guard while the construction crew was here. Now he\u2019ll make sure no varmints invaded since his morning patrol.\u201d</p><p>Linda laughed when the dog turned to look at them, as if to say the house was in their care now.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you do today?\u201d Linda asked as Sam led the way into the kitchen. She nodded when he pulled out a bottle of wine.</p><p>He poured her a glass. \u201cFinancial chores\u2014bank, accountant. Had a chat with a couple of people, looked at some new equipment, ordered more grain.\u201d He grabbed a beer for himself and drew her out to the front porch to join him on the swing.</p><p>\u201cBusy man.\u201d He had so many balls in the air, it was a wonder he could keep track. And she\u2019d thought running a store was tricky...and thinking of that made her remember basketry. \u201cOops. I left a basket I wanted to finish out in the car. And my purse.\u201d</p><p>He walked to her car with her and carried in the oversize tote of basketry supplies.</p><p>After setting her purse near the door, she pulled her cell out. The display showed texts and voice mails from Brenna and Charles. She sucked in a startled breath. So many messages. Had something happened? Why\u2019d she been so stupid as to leave her phone in the car?</p><p>\u201cGot a problem?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Sam. \u201cMy children called. Lots of calls.\u201d Her hand shook as she hit Brenna\u2019s speed-dial number.</p><p>\u201cMom. Mommy. I\u2019m sorry. God, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Her daughter was crying, almost incoherent. \u201cWe didn\u2019t mean it. We shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Charles had apparently grabbed Brenna\u2019s phone, and he didn\u2019t sound any better.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d What had they done? Burned her house down? \u201cCharles, whatever you did, I forgive you, but what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, the way we talked to you. What we said. We didn\u2019t realize.\u201d Her big, strong son sounded as if he was in tears.</p><p>She looked at Sam, terror rising inside her. \u201cThey\u2019re almost hysterical. What\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sam plucked the phone from her limp fingers and said into it, \u201cA man makes his apologies in person. Got a piece of paper?\u201d He paused, then gave his address. \u201cA half hour? Good.\u201d He tossed the phone into her open purse before giving her a nod. \u201cThey\u2019ll come here. I need a shower.\u201d</p><p>Mouth open, she stared after him. Her children had tried to apologize for the way they\u2019d talked to her. Had been crying. And Sam hadn\u2019t been surprised; his dark gray eyebrows hadn\u2019t even lifted. As she sank into a chair, she heard the shower come on. Sam had given orders to Charles, and her obstinate son had taken them.</p><p>After a moment of weighing the facts, suspicion wove into knowledge. Sam had expected them to call. Could they have called him earlier? No, they didn\u2019t know his last name.</p><p>But Master Sam Davies certainly wouldn\u2019t have had any trouble finding her children. What had he done?</p><p>SAM LET THE hot water massage the tightness out of his shoulders and counted minutes in his head.</p><p>He\u2019d made it to three minutes when the shower door was flung open.</p><p>Mama Bear had left the cave. He tried to avert his face before she noticed his amusement, but didn\u2019t succeed.</p><p>Hands on hips, Linda glared at him. \u201cWhat did you do to my children?\u201d Even as furious as she was, her voice was still controlled. No shrieking, no hysterics. She was one fine woman. Then she slapped his shoulder. \u201cYou tell me. Now!\u201d</p><p>He gave her a quick scan. She\u2019d dressed for the farm in a V-neck T-shirt and jeans and left her shoes in the entry as he liked. Good enough. \u201cAs the sadist in this relationship, I do the slapping.\u201d He grabbed the front of her shirt and yanked her into the shower.</p><p>She was soaked in seconds. Nice scream. Set all the hair on his body tingling.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t allowed to hit me.\u201d He ripped her T-shirt at the neck and drew it downward, pinning her arms against her sides.</p><p>\u201cYou-you-you bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you figure to sit and stew until they show, think again.\u201d As she struggled, he unzipped her jeans and shoved them and her underwear down to hobble her ankles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDammit, let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He dug his fingers into the last remaining welts on her ass, pulling her against him. With an unbreakable grip on her nape, he held her for his kiss, taking and taking until she went limp against him. Until she kissed him back.</p><p>Goddamn, the woman could kiss. As he hardened, he rubbed his dick against her and felt her resistance melt. My woman. Reluctantly, he released her lips and lifted his head. \u201cCooperate and we finish fast. Otherwise your children will have to wait on the porch while you\u2019re busy in here.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d Her pants pinned her legs together, and he had to work to push his hand between her thighs. But there he found her wet and ready. She trembled when he stroked over her pussy. She heated up fast. For him. The knowledge was a bone-deep satisfaction.</p><p>He circled her clit, pushed inside her entrance, then circled again. Fast, Davies. Remember? He wanted to linger and play until she screamed his name in frustration, but with a resigned sigh, he pulled her T-shirt up and off, then her bra. Hand between her shoulder blades, he bent her over, then positioned her hands on the corner shower seat. \u201cKeep them there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam. My children will\u2014\u201d</p><p>When he slapped her ass in reprimand\u2014and to please himself\u2014the sound echoed beautifully in the big tile shower. How many years had it been since he\u2019d fucked a woman in a bathroom?</p><p>As the water beat on her ass, her bent-over position showed a hint of her glistening pussy, more of her anus. Nice. Even nicer, she stayed in place, and her face showed only arousal.</p><p>He rubbed the sting from her ass, pulled her labia open, and pushed his cock in an inch. Not roughly\u2014she was still too emotionally fragile for that\u2014but firmly. Had to be careful, but her wetness and low moan of pleasure said he was on the right path.</p><p>She was hotter than the shower, wetter, and tight enough to make him struggle for control. He pulled out halfway. When he thrust in all the way, the zing went straight to his balls.</p><p>Her ass tilted up slightly; she wanted more. Goddamn, she was cute.</p><p>He bent over her back. As his dick pressed deeper, she squirmed, taking him to the hilt. Burying his face in her lavender-citrus-scented hair, he reached around and cupped her breasts. Soft as anything he\u2019d found in his life. He kneaded them and pinched her nipples hard enough to have her whimpering and trying to pull away. But his chest pressed down on her, his dick impaled her; she wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Fucking nice. Her hot, slick cunt tightened each time he tugged on her breasts.</p><p>As the pain fed her arousal, her hips started to wiggle. He yanked her hair, pulling her head up as he drove into her. \u201cGive me more.\u201d</p><p>Her moan was like food for a starving man.</p><p>She certainly wasn\u2019t thinking about anything but him. And he was going to push her hard enough that when her children arrived, she\u2019d be glowing. So any guilt they tried to lay on her would slide off.</p><p>He coated his fingers with cream rinse and with the next thrust of his cock, he breached her asshole with a finger.</p><p>She gave a strangled gasp and attempted to straighten.</p><p>He leaned forward and gripped her shoulder, holding her down. \u201cStay put, missy.\u201d But he paused to check her response. Combining rough sex and anal sex might trigger some bad memories. \u201cWe at green?\u201d</p><p>As a fine trembling shook her body, her head bowed. Her whisper was barely loud enough to be heard over the water. \u201cGreen.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. Not only did taking it in the ass wake up every nerve down there, but it was also the pinnacle of surrender. Linda was giving him her submission.</p><p>So beautiful and loving and responsive\u2014she warmed his heart. He ran his hand over her back. \u201cGood girl. Now stay there.\u201d Spreading his legs for balance, he thrust his cock in deep, pulled back, and slid his finger into her ass. Alternating each until he could almost feel the humming in her body. He added another finger in her asshole, heard her breathing catch. \u201cSomeday, you\u2019ll take my cock there.\u201d</p><p>When a tremor shook her body, he grinned.</p> <p>But time to head for the finish line. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d As she braced her arms on the corner seat, he reached around her with his free hand and fingered her clit, then hammered into her pussy and thrust his fingers into her ass. Deliberately overloading her senses, he drove her hard, not easing up at all.</p><p>He could feel her legs shaking. Then her cunt tightened around his cock, her ass around his fingers. Her clit was fully unhooded, begging for more. Almost there.</p><p>Her neck arched, her body froze, and she came with a high wail that echoed off the tiles and made him grin.</p><p>As her pussy squeezed around his cock, he released his control and let her cunt suck him dry. With a low groan, he wrapped an arm around her waist, holding her up.</p><p>Although he could have stayed right there, buried deep, he felt her knees threatening to buckle. With a sigh of regret, he pulled out. After putting her on the seat, he washed up.</p><p>He grasped her jeans, still around her ankles. \u201cLift your legs.\u201d</p><p>She lifted one pretty leg, then the other. As he pulled her to her feet, she muttered, \u201cYou\u2019re such a jerk.\u201d</p><p>Hard to get offended when her voice was still husky from panting and coming. Still...no chance at punishing a little submissive should be overlooked. \u201cFor that, I\u2019m going to spank you later,\u201d he whispered in her ear.</p><p>She stiffened, making him grin. And the redhead would get off on being spanked\u2014he\u2019d see to it. He pulled her closer, feeling her softness all along his front.</p><p>Some people played in the bath with rubber ducks. Damn fools. Nothing was better than a flushed, trembling woman, scented with satisfaction.</p><p>After pushing her under the spray, he scrubbed her, making her dance as he played with her pussy and cleaned her tender little asshole.</p><p>Might be fun to see how sore she was there later tonight.</p><p>After he pulled on clean jeans and a work shirt, he helped her dry off, then gave her a set of sweats that would fit almost anyone. Ugly but adequate. Before she could complain, he warned, \u201cBetter hurry. Your half hour is almost up.\u201d</p><p>As she glared, he smothered a laugh and prudently left.</p><p>Did she realize he enjoyed pissing her off, just to see that cute expression on her face?</p><p>After checking the parking area, he knew the kids hadn\u2019t arrived yet. Soon though. He considered the next hour or so and shook his head ruefully. Be a rough evening. Lots of waterworks.</p><p>Might be smart to plan a distraction. He rubbed his chin. Maybe Nicole would like to join them.</p><p>Linda rose from the porch swing as her children ran up to the house. They were all right, no bandages, no limping, no scars. But they looked...awkward. Unsure.</p><p>Old memories flowed through her. Charles squealing with laughter when he\u2019d taken his first step and landed on his diapered bottom. Brenna\u2019s perpetually scabbed knees. Their bickering when Charles climbed a tree and Brenna couldn\u2019t. Their angelic faces when asleep. Her eyes blurred with tears. God, she loved them.</p><p>\u201cMommy.\u201d Brenna flung herself into Linda\u2019s arms.</p><p>Charles wrapped his arms around both of them. His cheek against her temple was wet, and Brenna was sobbing. What in the world had Sam said to them?</p><p>But now, now, she reveled in having her children back, in holding her girl, in trying to hug Charles and, as always, being shocked that he was taller than she was. Her babies had grown up, and she should treat them like adults. Talk over the problem. \u201cLet\u2019s sit down, guys,\u201d she said to Brenna, then squeezed Charles\u2019s hand.</p><p>As she took a seat on the swing, she noticed the end table held an iced tea, a root beer, and a Pepsi. Sam. But how did he know the children\u2019s preferences? She glanced around and saw him strolling toward the barn with Connagher trailing along. Were sadists supposed to be so tactful?</p><p>Brenna joined her on the swing, and Charles pulled a chair so close their knees touched.</p><p>\u201cNow, tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d Linda strove for an even voice, knowing that only Sam\u2019s nonchalance\u2014and shower diversion\u2014had prevented her from fretting herself sick.</p><p>Brenna\u2019s eyelids were red and swollen. \u201cYour friend, he said...\u201d She choked, and tears ran down her face.</p><p>Linda turned to Charles.</p><p>His hands were in fists on his knees. \u201cHe told us what you went through. Mom, we didn\u2019t know. We would never... We didn\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>Sam, that rat bastard. She sighed. Sam wouldn\u2019t have exaggerated or lied. He would have given them only the truth. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have told us.\u201d Brenna had a death grip on Linda\u2019s hand and now gave it a shake. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us how horrible it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Linda blinked back her own tears. Having her babies so upset made her chest hurt. \u201cI didn\u2019t want... It was hard enough on you, just hearing I\u2019d been kidnapped. You didn\u2019t need more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried to spare us, and so we dumped all over you.\u201d Charles gave a half laugh and opened her root beer. His hand trembled as he handed her the can, then gave Brenna her iced tea. \u201cYour friend is pretty protective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Sam shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should.\u201d Charles\u2019s lips firmed. \u201cThank God, he did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brenna leaned against Linda. \u201cWe needed to know, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>Brenna hadn\u2019t called her Mommy in years. Linda felt a tear escape. Somehow, she had a feeling she\u2019d never have the heart to yell at Sam for interfering.</p><p>\u201cCan you forgive us?\u201d Charles had never lacked the courage to admit his mistakes. \u201cForgive me?\u201d</p><p>Brenna snorted, snuggling closer. \u201cShe already did, dummy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did.\u201d Linda slid a few inches over on the swing, making room for her boy on her other side. Three was crowded...but wonderful.</p><p>Sam did his evening chores early since he\u2019d have company for supper. Be odd to have a full table. When his father had been alive, neighbors, friends, and relatives had often stayed for a meal. His stepfather had changed all that.</p><p>After a glance at Linda and the kids on the front porch, he and Conn swung around and used the back door.</p><p>Potatoes and chicken went in the oven to bake. Hopefully the kids weren\u2019t vegetarian, but he put together a big green salad just in case.</p><p>Through the open front door came only murmuring. No wailing. No shouting. Good sign.</p> <p>Even as Conn gave a happy bark and charged out the screen door, Sam heard tires on the drive. Nicole must have arrived. After grabbing a beer, he stepped out onto the porch. All three on the swing showed signs of a fair amount of tears, and goddamn, he hated seeing Linda upset. If she cried from a flogging or spanking, that was acceptable\u2014even enjoyable\u2014but this was a stab in the gut.</p><p>Yet the three were pressed together as close as they could get. All better, as Nicole would say. Now they needed time to get back to normal. He gave the kids a firm stare. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay for supper. My daughter will join us.\u201d</p><p>Linda gave him a startled look, then dimpled as her children nodded agreement.</p><p>Good enough. He leaned against the side porch railing and watched Nicole jump out of her Volkswagen Beetle. Back when he was young, most Bugs were splashed with paint in varying designs. Guess he should be grateful hers was merely bright yellow. She wore her usual jeans and layered tank tops, and\u2014he sighed\u2014she\u2019d dyed her short hair black. Women. No man could understand them.</p><p>She trotted up and gave him a fierce hug. \u201cGood timing, Dad. I didn\u2019t have a thing in the fridge, and I\u2019m starving. What\u2019s for supper?\u201d</p><p>He hugged her back, his pride in her as uncontrolled as a wildfire. Tough. Smart. Compassionate. How\u2019d he gotten so lucky? Arm around her, he turned toward the others. \u201cLinda, this is my daughter, Nicole. Those are Linda\u2019s kids, Charles and Brenna.\u201d He waited until they finished with the polite greetings. \u201cNicole, give Charles and Brenna a tour while Linda and I finish cooking. Figure forty-five minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d She went up on her tiptoes and whispered, \u201cBad Daddy. What did you do to them?\u201d</p><p>He choked down a laugh as Nicole waved the other two toward the yard, saying, \u201cWhat do you want to see first?\u201d</p><p>As the three headed down the steps, Charles asked her, \u201cAren\u2019t you in my sociology class? Mondays at ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I\u2019d seen you before. What\u2019s your major?\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head. Amazing how well kids could rebound. After setting his beer on the end table, he joined Linda on the swing. When he put his arm around her and pulled her closer, she sighed and snuggled in. A worry drained away; she wasn\u2019t furious with him. \u201cAll made up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d She gave him a glare, although her puffy eyes and tear streaks removed the power. \u201cWhat did you tell them, Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the truth.\u201d He tucked a lock of hair behind her ear and pulled her closer for a slow kiss. \u201cI can understand why you didn\u2019t share with them, but not knowing caused a rift between you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She yanked his hair lightly. \u201cI should wallop you for making them cry, but thank you.\u201d Her breath hitched. \u201cGod, Sam, thank you. I have my babies back.\u201d</p> <p>He understood her relief. He and Nicole had gone through a few ugly battles. Felt like a hole in the heart when she was mad at him.</p><p>They rocked for a while as the children stopped at the fountain in the front yard circle to admire the koi, then headed for the pasture behind the stable. The horses, ever greedy, trotted to the fence for handouts. Above the orchards, puffy clouds broke up the blue of the sky. The cooling air held the scent of the ocean mixed with the pastures. Next to him, Linda smelled of his soap, and he liked it, possessive bastard that he was.</p><p>\u201cCome and set the table for me,\u201d he said eventually and hauled her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cFive of us,\u201d Linda said. As he pulled out the chicken and potatoes, she added a leaf to the table and found place settings.</p><p>The thumping of feet and laughter came through the screen door as the kids stopped on the porch to finish their drinks. Nicole\u2019s clear voice drifted in. \u201cDad, kinky? Oh, somebody said something once, but ew... Thinking of my father having sex makes me want to bleach my brain, right?\u201d</p><p>Linda snorted and flashed him a grin.</p><p>\u201cGoes both ways. Don\u2019t like thinking of Nicole with some asshole,\u201d Sam muttered. \u201cWhen she started dating, I hung a bullwhip by the door. Just in case...\u201d</p><p>And why the hell should that make Linda bust out laughing?</p><p>After a long, cheerful supper, Linda\u2019s children gave her warm hugs and followed Nicole out to the cars. Back to their lives.</p><p>As Linda strummed Sam\u2019s guitar, her eyes welled with tears...again. The possibility of losing her babies had shaken her more than she\u2019d ever want to admit. Bless Sam.</p><p>At her smothered sob, he glanced up and, seeing her tears, shook his head in reproof. But he didn\u2019t speak, just continued braiding leather in an intricate pattern around a whipstock. His very silence wove a spell of peace in the room.</p><p>And as she watched the sureness of his lean fingers, she felt a flush of heat from her toes to her fingers. She remembered all too well those hard hands on her body. Wanted his hands on her again. Honestly, she was turning into a nympho.</p><p>At my age. How funny\u2014both of them had adult children. She smiled and switched to fingerpicking an old ballad. Sam had a lovely daughter. Intelligent, friendly, and quirky with outrageous opinions on everything, ranging from Tampa politics to earthworms. Sam had merely listened with laughter in his eyes. He never said anything openly affectionate to his girl, nothing like the \u201cI love you\u2019s\u201d that she and her children had exchanged, but now and then, he\u2019d wrap an arm around the girl\u2019s waist and give her a squeeze or ruffle her spiky black hair. The love was there.</p><p>Nicole\u2019s comment about not wanting to know about her father\u2019s sex life had been...interesting. Then again, Sam had said he didn\u2019t bring women home. Not that he ever explained any more about that. Or anything. She frowned down at the strings of the guitar. Was that reticence who Sam was, or was there another reason? Sometimes, it would be so much easier to talk things over if she really knew him.</p><p>When he met her eyes, she realized she\u2019d been staring at him. He gave her a half smile. \u201cLet me put this away, and we can watch a show if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>After nudging Conn over so he could rise, Sam walked out of the room.</p><p>Linda returned the guitar to its rack and curled into a corner of the couch, trying to muster up her courage. With no fire in the fireplace, the room seemed to have chilled. She considered pulling out her basketry. Her fingers needed something to do.</p><p>Big hands closed around hers. \u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you, girl?\u201d Seated on the oversize leather ottoman, Sam studied her face.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cAbout today.\u201d</p><p>He waited.</p><p>Darn him, it would help if he prompted her or something. \u201cI-I appreciate what you did. To get my children back. I guess I won\u2019t kill you for interfering.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked. \u201cGuess I can sleep easy tonight.\u201d</p><p>Hitting him now would be unwise. \u201cAbout the shower. I wanted to...\u201d There was no easy way to talk about this. How did other submissives manage?</p><p>His eyes grew intense. \u201cJust spit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m submissive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t be that way except...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it now, slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPresent yourself to the buyer, slut.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip as nausea roiled inside her.</p><p>He made a noise in the back of his throat, then plucked her from the couch and sat with her in his lap.</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d</p><p>His left arm curved around her shoulders, holding her against his chest. With his right hand, he tilted her head up, brushing his thumb over her chin. \u201cSee if you can talk easier like this,\u201d he said.</p><p>She curled her fingers around his forearm. He\u2019d derailed her thoughts. \u201cI can\u2019t figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigure what out, baby?\u201d</p><p>She stared into his eyes. Sometimes, the pale blue of his eyes had a darker rim. \u201cThe...they kept us under control. All the time. And now, now, I can\u2019t let you do that. Because of them. I need to know\u2014to agree to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo give up your power,\u201d he suggested softly.</p><p>\u201cYes. And when you yanked me into the shower, I...\u201d She dredged up all the honesty she could find, opening herself. \u201cI liked it. I did. But it scared me too, because if you tell me to do some slavey thing, something I really don\u2019t want to do, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d refuse. I sometimes don\u2019t know if I obey you because they...conditioned...me or because I want to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>Her throat tightened with frustration. She couldn\u2019t explain because she didn\u2019t really understand it herself. \u201cI just want limits on when...when you order me around.\u201d Her breathing hitched.</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d He tucked her head against his shoulder, letting her get herself back under control. Not driving her to expose more, to bare her soul.</p><p>Her breathing steadied.</p><p>\u201cBetween a Dom and sub, most things are negotiable.\u201d He pushed her hair out of her face. \u201cI have certain requirements. I want to be in control when it comes to sex.\u201d He considered and added, \u201cI like demanding sex when I want it, but I can give in there.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t exactly back off earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He traced his finger down her jaw. \u201cThat was my next point. Making you kneel or strip or do menial labor? Not interested. But if it comes to your well-being, I\u2019m not flexible.\u201d His square jaw hardened. \u201cThis afternoon, I wasn\u2019t about to let you fret yourself sick.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Her gaze traced down the strong line of his neck to his right shoulder. The shirtsleeve covered the rocklike bulge of his biceps and was rolled up over his thick forearm. He had the strength to enforce anything he wanted. Like he had this afternoon.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t felt dirty when he\u2019d dragged her into the shower, maybe because he\u2019d said why he was forcing her to cooperate. \u201cIf you figure to worry until they show, think again.\u201d It hadn\u2019t been an arbitrary act. \u201cMaybe that will work,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIf there\u2019s a reason. More than you just want to...to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlaunt my control over you?\u201d he finished in a dry voice.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She looked up with butterflies in her stomach. He didn\u2019t look upset, just thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll limit power exchanges to this: I control everything dealing with sex...or pain. You always have a safe word. Timing is negotiable unless I step in for your safety or health.\u201d</p><p>Really? She felt as if she\u2019d been braced against a hard wind that had just disappeared, leaving her falling forward. Looking him in the eyes, she agreed. \u201cYes.\u201d In a lower voice, she added, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He traced his finger around her mouth. \u201cI should warn you, though. I\u2019ll find other methods to get my way.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it\u2019s your turn to pick the movie. But if it has a romance in it, I\u2019m going to play with the pussy whip as well as spank your ass.\u201d</p><p>Oh heavens. She couldn\u2019t keep from squirming at the memory of that whip. She wanted\u2014didn\u2019t want\u2014wanted that intense torment again. And the most sadistic part was now she couldn\u2019t decide whether to pick a romance or not.</p><p>From the evil glint in his ice-colored eyes, he\u2019d deliberately left her with that dilemma.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>On Saturday, Linda, trying to remember everyone\u2019s names, brought up the rear of the women piling out of the bachelorette party limousine. She\u2019d already met Andrea, Jessica, Kim, Gabi, and Beth. Kari was the submissive of another Shadowlands Master. Sally, Uzuri, Rainie, and Dara were trainees\u2014submissives who didn\u2019t have a Dom but wanted to learn more about the lifestyle.</p><p>None of the women were her age, but the common interest of BDSM had bridged the gap. A couple of glasses of champagne hadn\u2019t hurt the bonding either.</p><p>She\u2019d decided the women were all crazy. On the ride over, they\u2019d told stories of what not to do to a Dom and other mistakes they\u2019d made. Like the night a tired Uzuri had downed two coffees before a scene. After the poor Dom spent ages on the bondage and suspension, she\u2019d had to beg for a bathroom break. Or Gabi, who\u2019d gotten mad at Marcus and used his favorite canes as fireplace kindling.</p><p>Just the idea of doing that with one of Sam\u2019s toys was...appalling. Oh, she might enjoy the look on his face for all of a few seconds, but then...the wrath of God would come crashing down on her.</p> <p>Why did that sound so tempting?</p><p>Linda followed the group into the nightclub. Rather than the Shadowland\u2019s medieval atmosphere, this place\u2019s decor was grungy harshness. Concrete floor, black brick walls, red-hued paintings. Metal everywhere, from bar stools to aluminum siding behind the bar to twisted metal railings leading to the second floor. \u201cInteresting,\u201d Linda said. \u201cJessica likes this kind of place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re here because the club advertised it has BDSM equipment.\u201d Gabi hooked an arm with hers.</p><p>\u201cYou brought Shadowlands submissives to a different club?\u201d</p><p>Gabi grinned. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t exactly get falling down drunk in Z\u2019s club, now could we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d In fact, doing anything wild and crazy under Master Z\u2019s nose would be sheer insanity. \u201cAre we dressed up like Dommes to keep from getting hit on as submissives?\u201d</p><p>Beth heard the comment and turned. \u201cNah. We just wanted to give Jessica one last chance to switch to the dominant side.\u201d Beth unzipped the biker jacket she wore, revealing a black bustier and black vinyl pants. \u201cBesides, Dommes have the coolest clothes.\u201d</p><p>Linda grinned. \u201cTrue.\u201d She wore all black as well. Her skinny black jeans almost disappeared under the impact of high vinyl boots and her skintight, long-sleeved latex shirt. She\u2019d unzipped the front low enough that most guys wouldn\u2019t see past the cleavage.</p><p>\u201cI used to wear clothes like this, right up until my first night as a trainee.\u201d Andrea tried to look pitiful\u2014not easy for someone who reminded Linda of Wonder Woman. \u201cCullen was the trainer, and he said a sub couldn\u2019t wear more clothes than the Dom. The cabr\u00f3n made me strip right in the center of the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d Linda frowned, recalling the giant bartender with his booming laugh. \u201cAnd I thought he seemed so easygoing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is...right until he slides into Demon Dom mode.\u201d Andrea grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t tell him, but I go all melty inside when he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d Linda muttered. When Sam got that look in his eyes\u2014the one that said she\u2019d better do exactly what he ordered\u2014her bones turned squishy. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know I\u2019m not the only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim\u2019s creating us a spot,\u201d announced Sally. \u201cCome on, Mistresses.\u201d Although not that tall, the brunette wore such a red latex T-shirt that she stood out like Rudolph, the reindeer. They followed her through the crowd at the entrance, past the bar, along the side of the dance floor, and up some stairs.</p><p>When Linda looked around, she saw a balcony ran around the perimeter of the second floor. From there, people were watching the dancing and the randomly scattered short St. Andrew\u2019s crosses, spanking benches, and stocks.</p><p>\u201cOver here,\u201d Kim called as she industriously shoved chairs, couches, and coffee tables into a disorganized cluster near the railing. \u201cLadies. Here\u2019s our little bit of heaven for the evening.\u201d She dropped into a chair by the railing.</p><p>The rest of the group happily spread out.</p><p>\u201cSit with me.\u201d Jessica pulled Linda down next to her on a long couch, then nodded to her left. \u201cLook at them. Aren\u2019t they a study in contrasts?\u201d</p><p>Linda had to laugh. Dara had a pale complexion with blonde, spiky hair and wore black leathers. Next to her was Uzuri, with black skin, braided hair, and a dark red catsuit. Obviously hearing the comment, Uzuri grinned over her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find us a boy and beat his white ass for a while.\u201d</p><p>Sprawled in an armchair, Rainie snickered. \u201cI don\u2019t know about Dara, but Mistress U, I bet you\u2019ve never been on the handle side of a flogger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d Uzuri\u2019s beaded hair clattered as she tossed her head. \u201cBut we look so fine he won\u2019t notice anything else.\u201d She knocked her fist against Dara\u2019s.</p><p>Giggling, Jessica rose. \u201cThank you all! This is just great and so much more fun that what I thought it would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re just getting started, Mistress Jessica,\u201d Gabi said. \u201cRainie, did you bring your stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d Rainie grinned. A big woman, she\u2019d refused to try to squirm her way into latex or leather pants, but wore a fluorescent blue vinyl dress, fingerless gloves with small spikes on the back, and a coiled whip on her studded belt. A vine tattoo ran from her shoulder to disappear between her breasts. \u201cThe chauffeur agreed he\u2019d haul it up here for us. That\u2019s what Sally\u2019s watching for.\u201d</p><p>Stuff? Linda wondered.</p><p>Jessica\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t. Here, in a public place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Sally\u2019s idea, so Jessica would have fun toys for her honeymoon,\u201d Rainie said. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s supposed to be a BDSM club, right? Shouldn\u2019t be anything they\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d Jessica\u2019s champagne-fueled giggles increased. \u201cSally, you\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>Sally glanced back with the \u201cI\u2019m so innocent\u201d look of a dedicated troublemaker, then leaned over the railing and yelled, \u201cHey, Chauffeur!\u201d</p><p>Uzuri added her voice. \u201cUp here, Limo Man!\u201d</p><p>A minute later, the lanky chauffeur hauled two heavy-duty suitcases up the stairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s earned himself a huge tip,\u201d Kim muttered.</p><p>The man set the suitcases on the two coffee tables, gave the gathering a slight bow, and left without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Mistresses, here you go.\u201d Rainie opened the cases with a flourish.</p><p>Linda\u2019s mouth dropped open. Foam padding lined one suitcase and had been cut out to hold...dildos. Vibrators. She turned her head. The other case held colorful spray bottles and tubes, a couple of crops, a few cuffs, blindfolds... She stared at Rainie. \u201cYou have suitcases of sex toys?\u201d</p> <p>The trainee laughed so hard her breasts jiggled. \u201cI spend all day surrounded by men. Hosting these parties lets me hang out with women.\u201d She raised her voice. \u201cCheck it out, ladies. I set it up, so if you decide you just have to own something tonight, I can do that.\u201d</p><p>As Sally, Uzuri, and Dara whooped and converged on the toys, Linda sagged back in her couch. \u201cI need a drink.\u201d</p><p>Before the words were out of her mouth, Gabi thumped two pitchers down. \u201cMargaritas, anyone?\u201d</p><p>The evening passed in a blur of gossip, intriguing tidbits of life at home with a Dom, playing the Domme game that Gabi and Sally had invented, and checking out Rainie\u2019s stock of toys. By the time the first pitchers were gone, half the places in the suitcases were empty. Clever Rainie had brought along brown paper bags to hold their purchases.</p><p>It had only taken two margaritas before Linda caved in. A vibrator for the G-spot. How could she resist? And then she won a prize she never intended to use but no one would trade with her. She\u2019d definitely make sure Sam never saw that one.</p> <p>Frowning, Kari sank onto the couch next to Linda and dubiously examined her own prize. A cock ring.</p><p>\u201cProblems?\u201d Rainie asked.</p><p>\u201cAside from talking Dan into letting me near his guy parts with this?\u201d Kari looked over ruefully. \u201cThe main problem is finding the energy. Zane is teething, Dan is putting in overtime because of some creepy rapist, and all too often I\u2019d rather sleep than mess around.\u201d</p><p>Remembering the sleep-deprived, zombie world of new motherhood, Linda patted her hand. \u201cOnce Zane is older, you\u2019ll catch up on sleep. And if you want a babysitter so you can...play...out of hearing range, well, I love babies.\u201d</p><p>Kari hugged Linda. \u201cYou\u2019re so nice. Thank you. We\u2019ll take you up on that.\u201d She fingered the cock ring and grinned. \u201cI\u2019m dying to see Dan\u2019s face when I pull this out\u2014let alone when I try to get it on him.\u201d</p><p>Dan was the cop, wasn\u2019t he? Gorgeous but awfully stern looking. Poor Kari. Linda smothered a laugh, trying to imagine talking Sam into cooperating.</p> <p>\u201cKari, it\u2019s time for the next competition,\u201d Kim called.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Kari checked the clipboard on the end table. \u201cLinda and Jessica, your attention, please.\u201d Sweet-faced Kari sounded exactly like the schoolteacher she was.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mistress.\u201d Jessica saluted. \u201cOur assignment?\u201d</p><p>Kari handed each of them a paddle. \u201cGo downstairs, find a man, get him to bend over, then give him three good swats.\u201d</p><p>Linda stared. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first to swat wins.\u201d From her chair by the railing, Kim raised her glass in a toast. \u201cBut the loser still has to paddle a guy, or else you\u2019ll receive the swats from us up here.\u201d</p><p>Jessica scowled. \u201cHow come Andrea and Dara got off easy? Getting a guy to unzip and show if he\u2019s wearing tighty-whities or boxers isn\u2019t that difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuck of the draw, girlfriend,\u201d Gabi said, no sympathy in her voice. \u201cGo.\u201d</p> <p>As Linda stood, she could feel the alcohol buzzing in her veins. Champagne, then...margaritas. Note to self: slow down on the consumption. She glanced at Jessica, who was in the same condition. Not...quite...drunk. \u201cWe can do this.\u201d</p><p>Jessica gave her a shoulder bump. \u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>At the top step, Linda paused.</p><p>Jessica stopped behind her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m summoning my inner Domme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have one of those, inner or outer. I\u2019m an accountant. I don\u2019t boss people around. Well, unless they\u2019re missing paperwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go.\u201d Linda grinned. \u201cEver had someone dump a shoebox of receipts on your desk just before tax day?\u201d</p><p>Jessica\u2019s expression changed completely. \u201cOh, have I.\u201d Her mouth firmed and her back straightened as they walked down the steps. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny mother who\u2019s survived teenagers has developed some Domme.\u201d Linda reached for a memory to put her in the right frame of mind. Maybe Charles\u2019s sixteenth birthday party when she\u2019d discovered a boy had smuggled in a bottle of tequila. Yeah, she\u2019d definitely gone Domme all over that youngster\u2019s head. Maintain that attitude.</p><p>They reached the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Jessica muttered.</p><p>\u201cMay the best woman win,\u201d Linda said. She headed to the left; Jessica went right.</p><p>Men lined the bar, watching the dance floor, checking out the women. Very few were her age, but for her assignment, a younger man would be easier.</p><p>Not the one in a suit. Not the skinny lad who looked barely twenty-one. Not the jock. Not...</p><p>When an older man\u2019s gaze swept over her, then focused sharply, she got a bit of the squirmy little mouse feeling that Sam\u2019s Dom look could induce. Could the guy tell she was submissive?</p><p>And wouldn\u2019t Sam have a fit if he saw her in Domme gear, wielding a paddle?</p><p>With a huff of amusement, she turned away to check the nearby tables. Not the obnoxious drunk. Not the geek. Then she saw a candidate standing at a tall table. His gaze lingered on her tight shirt, well enhanced with cleavage. Mistress L for Lethal, that\u2019s me.</p><p>He looked midtwenties. A trim mustache. Light brown frohawk. Jeans and an All American Rejects T-shirt.</p><p>Wish me luck; I\u2019m going in. She approached his table. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, boy?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cJeremy.\u201d He swallowed as she stepped into his space. \u201cYou look...wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d She gave him an assured head tilt. \u201cI want you to bend over.\u201d</p><p>He stared into her eyes as if mesmerized. \u201cWhat?\u201d She could actually see him shiver.</p><p>\u201cPresent that pretty ass to me, boy.\u201d Her voice took on a familiar-sounding growl. Don\u2019t think about Sam. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, he did just that. Seriously? Without letting herself hesitate, she swatted him. One. Two. The third got a grunt from him. Cheers came from the bar, and Linda heard screams and applause from her crew above.</p><p>\u201cWhat a good boy.\u201d Trying not to burst into laughter, she waited for him to straighten, gave him a firm kiss on the lips, then started to walk away.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Wait.\u201d He was following her.</p><p>What in the world? She stopped.</p><p>He held his hand out. \u201cKneel\u2014am I supposed to kneel? Can I give you my number? Will you call me? Please?\u201d</p><p>Oh, dear heavens, someone just found his inner submissive. She patted his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m taken, sweetie. But I\u2019m sure you can find a nice Mistress.\u201d</p><p>From the look in his eyes, he\u2019d be doing just that. She knew the feeling. Pretending to be a Top left her craving Sam\u2019s dominance.</p><p>On the stairs, she spotted Jessica near the dance floor, trying to convince a man to bend over. When Linda wiggled her hips in a victory dance, the little blonde sent her a sizzling glare.</p><p>The women on the balcony greeted her with laughter and high fives. Dara slapped her back, and Rainie handed her a prize of lubricant, saying, \u201cGabi said you should have this flavor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrange?\u201d Linda took it. Why orange?</p><p>On the couch, Kim hadn\u2019t stopped laughing. She finally hauled in a breath and pointed at Linda. \u201cYour expression when that puppy tried to follow you?\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Linda sank down next to her. \u201cI felt guilty, leading the poor baby on.\u201d She picked up her drink and took a couple of good swallows, savoring the underlying bite of tequila. \u201cIt was amazing he couldn\u2019t tell I was pretending. Bet a Dom would see right through the act.\u201d Sam would have.</p><p>\u201cWhen I met Dan, I told him I wasn\u2019t submissive.\u201d In the adjacent chair, Kari wrinkled her nose. \u201cHe laughed at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice when a guy sees who you are.\u201d Sally leaned back against the railing. \u201cWhen I\u2019m dating vanilla guys, I feel like I have to pretend to be someone I\u2019m not. Gets to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Linda said under her breath. Letting Lee go had been the right decision.</p><p>And Sam? Sam definitely saw her for who she was...and liked her that way.</p><p>The chauffeur was hauling people home in two batches. The ones who wanted an early night left on the first run. The last few remained, waiting for the chauffer to return for them. Linda, Sally, Jessica, Gabi, and Kim. After getting more margaritas\u2014strawberry, this time\u2014they\u2019d pushed the two couches over to the railing so they could crowd together and watch the dance floor.</p><p>Sitting between Gabi and Kim, Linda sipped her tangy, sweet drink. How many had she had now? She felt nicely blurry and very happy. It was wonderful to be with women again. I miss my girlfriends. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou lost touch?\u201d Gabi asked softly.</p><p>Realizing she\u2019d spoken the thought, Linda frowned at the glass in her hand. Definitely over your limit, girl. She set her drink on the railing. \u201cI had two BFFs, but one moved to Oregon, the other to California. You know how it is when you meet someone who just clicks? We clicked.\u201d</p><p>Gabi tilted her head toward Kim. \u201cWe met in college, and then no matter how long between visits, we could just take up where we\u2019d left off. I feel that way about this crew now.\u201d She patted Linda\u2019s arm. \u201cAnd that includes you.\u201d</p><p>Warmth filled Linda as she realized Gabi meant it. Sally and Jessica on the other couch were both nodding in agreement.</p> <p>Then Jessica gave an annoyed sniff. \u201cOnly I\u2019m going to hold a grudge because you beat me at Domming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you and Z have children, you\u2019ll be able to intimidate anyone.\u201d Linda grinned. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at that guy.\u201d Kim pointed. A man with a beer belly, weak chin, and pompous expression strutted across the dance floor. \u201cThe creep has been doing that \u2018Oh dear, the floor\u2019s so crowded. Did I rub against your tit?\u2019 maneuver. I\u2019m going to rank him at the TNTC level, maybe midway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRating men is so shallow. You should be ashamed.\u201d Linda tsk-tsked at Kim. Besides, Kim had the ranking wrong\u2014someone who groped women should be at the bottom level.</p><p>\u201cSally and Rainie invented it,\u201d Kim pseudowhined, sounding so much like Brenna in a pout that Linda laughed.</p> <p>Jessica pointed a finger at Linda. \u201cHypocat...hypercrat...hypo...hell with it, you faker. I heard you give that cutie a \u2018tie me up, baby rating\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA TMUB? Really?\u201d Kim popped upright, spilling her drink as she craned her neck. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Gabi snickered. \u201cYou are so drunk. Raoul\u2019s going to have a fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Kim held up her sack. \u201cI\u2019ll just show him my new toys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a sneaky brat.\u201d Gabi opened her sack and peered inside. \u201cI don\u2019t remember what I got...except that I won a gag. Marcus is never going to see that one.\u201d</p><p>A second later, they were all checking their bags.</p> <p>\u201cAw, poor baby,\u201d Sally said to her bag. \u201cDo you want to come out and play?\u201d</p><p>Jessica was giggling. \u201cMine does.\u201d</p><p>As Linda leaned forward to speak to Jessica, she noticed a balding man on the ground floor staring up, eyes bulging.</p><p>Linda followed his gaze, and her mouth dropped open.</p><p>Jessica was bouncing her oversize cock-like vibrator along the railing toward where Sally was moving her vibrator in circles.</p><p>\u201cYou two. What are you doing?\u201d Linda sputtered.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jessica said with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s a rabbit. It wants to hop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine\u2019s searching for the G-spot. It knows there\u2019s one around here somewhere.\u201d Sally crossed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve been with guys like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow \u2019bout the ones who couldn\u2019t find your clit if it bit them?\u201d Gabi asked.</p><p>\u201cYou are so\u2014\u201d Jessica\u2019s rabbit hopped, missed the railing. She fumbled, secured it before it fell.</p><p>Giggling uncontrollably, they all stared down at where it would have landed...on the balding man.</p><p>He leered at them and cupped his crotch.</p><p>\u201cEw. I wouldn\u2019t have him. Not even after a bottle of tequila.\u201d Jessica shoved her poor rabbit back into the bag.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty harsh.\u201d The \u201cnot even\u201d rating was the lowest of all. Linda considered, then saw the guy licking his lips, rubbing his pelvis vigorously. \u201cWell, maybe not.\u201d</p><p>Kim looked down at the floor, and her nose wrinkled. \u201cNot even if he had a cock piercing.\u201d</p><p>After putting her vibe into her bag, Sally said, \u201cNot even if he killed a palmetto bug for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d Linda said. \u201cBut you\u2019d think there\u2019d be a better class of male in this establishment.\u201d She looked around hopefully. \u201cA few older ones\u2014you know\u2014for my enjoyment? I haven\u2019t spotted an AYW-ID yet, and I wanted one for my record.\u201d</p><p>Gabi studied her glass. \u201cI\u2019m so trashed I can\u2019t remember what an AYW-ID is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you want,\u201d Sally started, and Jessica sang along for the last part, \u201cI\u2019ll do. AYW-ID.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d Gabi took the last swallow of her drink. \u201cI knew that.\u201d</p><p>Linda gave up checking the dance floor. Maybe, like cream, the better guys rose to the top. She turned her attention to the balcony on the far wall. The waiter over there wasn\u2019t bad. He was serving a skinny young man who didn\u2019t look old enough to be in a bar. Past that table was a group of men seated in a cluster of chairs. They looked older. She tried to focus.</p><p>The one on the left looked over. Pale eyes in a darkly tanned face met her gaze...trapped her gaze. Knocked the bottom out of her stomach and her drink out of her hand onto her boot. Sam. \u201cAYW-ID,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAYW-ID.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You found a hottie?\u201d Gabi half stood, froze, and fell back onto the couch, moaning. \u201cMarcus is over there. They\u2019re all over there.\u201d She pulled her policeman\u2019s leather jacket closed.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Jessica scrambled to her feet.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, they\u2019re staring at us.\u201d Kim balanced herself on the couch. \u201cYou think we could go out the back?\u201d</p><p>Jessica\u2019s hands were over her mouth, trying to stop her laughter. \u201cGirl, you can\u2019t even stand up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn chauffeur should have picked us up sooner.\u201d Gabi scowled. Then her eyes widened. \u201cHow long do you suppose they were there?\u201d</p><p>Linda risked a quick glance. \u201cHowever long, they\u2019re headed over here now.\u201d Exhilaration bubbled in her blood. Sam is here.</p><p>\u201cHere! Noooo, Z mustn\u2019t see these.\u201d Jessica frantically shoved her wealth of toys in her oversize bag.</p><p>\u201cThe gag! And I didn\u2019t bring a purse.\u201d Gabi staggered over to the couch, dumped her sack of toys, and tried to force them into her jacket pockets. A bright red ball gag hit the floor and bounced under the couch. She dropped to her knees with a painful-sounding thud and tried to retrieve it.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t even stand? Now that\u2019s downright pitiful.\u201d The deep voice was as slow as the Mississippi and held a faint Southern drawl. The man\u2019s sharp blue eyes were several shades darker than Sam\u2019s.</p><p>Gabi\u2019s head jerked up, eyes wide.</p><p>Linda tilted her head. Would this be Gabi\u2019s Marcus?</p><p>\u201cHave to agree. Better get them home.\u201d Sam tucked his thumbs under his belt, drawing her attention to where his long sleeves had been rolled up, revealing his muscled forearms and powerful hands. She knew how those hands felt on her body. And those fingers sure didn\u2019t have any trouble finding her clit\u2014or G-spot either.</p><p>Jessica shoved her blonde hair behind her shoulders. \u201cHey. You don\u2019t get a say in this. It\u2019s my bacher...balorette...bachette... It\u2019s my party.\u201d</p><p>Master Z put his hand on Jessica\u2019s shoulder and then tilted her head up. \u201cKitten, you make an adorable drunk.\u201d</p><p>She beamed at him. \u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He hooked her purse on her shoulder, scooped her up in his arms, and headed for the stairs. \u201cLet\u2019s see how good you are at drunken sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSumisa.\u201d Raoul pulled Kim to her feet and caught her as she tipped sideways.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got bribes to get out of trouble.\u201d She held up her bag.</p><p>\u201cPlanning ahead, are you?\u201d When he lifted her into his arms, she buried her face against his shoulder.</p><p>Linda gave a sigh of envy. The Masters were so sweet. Sam was too. She smiled at him before noticing his stern expression. His arms were crossed over his chest.</p><p>Oh boy, she was going to catch hell. A thrill ran through her at the thought. What would he do?</p><p>Lips quirking, Marcus took Gabi\u2019s newly retrieved ball gag from her hand. After studying it for a second, he tried to tuck it into her jacket pocket and found the pockets full. \u201cYou\u2019ve been busy, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She batted her eyelashes at him, slipping the gag from his fingers. \u201cGuess we\u2019d better go, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do believe that would be wise.\u201d With an arm around her waist, he tried to help her down the stairs.</p><p>Halfway down, she staggered.</p><p>Laughing, Marcus bent over and picked her up. As he straightened, Gabi flung the hated ball gag over the railing. It bounced along the floor and hit an older man\u2019s foot.</p><p>Linda exchanged a look with Sally, and they both burst into laughter.</p><p>The chauffeur passed Marcus and Gabi on the stairs. He nodded at Sam, then gave Linda and Sally a concerned look. \u201cWhere are the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir Mas\u2014um, friends took them home,\u201d Sally said. The laughter faded from her face, leaving a vulnerable sadness behind. \u201cWish I was so lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetie.\u201d Linda wrapped her arms around the young woman. \u201cYou\u2019ll find your special one. You will.\u201d</p><p>Blinking wet eyes, Sally squeezed her back.</p><p>Feeling luckier than she could say, Linda held the young woman and looked up at Sam. He was watching them, his expression gentle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a minute, Sally pulled in a slow breath. When she lifted her head, her usual vivaciousness was back. \u201cWell, until I find the perfect one, let the good times roll.\u201d She gave the chauffeur a wicked grin. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Jeeves. I\u2019m your only passenger, so I expect awesome service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, miss.\u201d With the hauteur of an English butler, he gave a slight bow and offered his arm when she staggered slightly.</p><p>As the two walked toward the stairs, Linda realized with a jolt that she was the last one left. Uh-oh. She turned her head.</p><p>Sam was watching her. His gaze ran slowly over her Domme outfit, and then his lips curved in a hard smile. \u201cDid you give some submissive a thrill, Mistress Red?\u201d</p> <p>After a second, she remembered the young man. She laughed, laughed again, and said triumphantly, \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s brows drew together. \u201cWhat?

She eyed him worriedly. \u201cAre you upset?\u201d</p> <p>His face went unreadable as if he\u2019d frozen his emotions.</p><p>Worry slid into her veins like cold grease. Why didn\u2019t he answer? \u201cSam. I didn\u2019t... It was just a game. Really.\u201d Remembering the outcome of the game, she started to grin. \u201cI beat Jessica and won a toy.\u201d</p><p>After a long second, his eyes filled with amusement, and he barked a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re sloshed, missy. Time to go home.\u201d</p><p>With an easy swing, he pulled her to her feet, then wrapped an arm around her as he guided her toward the stairs. She only tripped twice...well, maybe three times...and dropped her sack once before he huffed a laugh and swung her into his arms.</p><p>She gave a happy sigh. Okay, admit it, I was jealous of the others getting carried.</p><p>Outside, Sam set her on her feet beside his truck. Linda\u2019s ears rang in the quiet night. A car moved past with a glare of lights and a wash of gas fumes. As she tried to read Sam\u2019s expression, she realized she was seeing two of him. She blinked. Heavens, she couldn\u2019t handle one Sam; two might make her heart stop. She giggled.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty sound. You don\u2019t laugh enough, girl.\u201d He pulled open the truck door.</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cI\u2019m happy. Cuz I\u2019m with an AYW-ID.\u201d</p><p>She felt him kiss the top of her head before he lifted her onto the passenger seat. Once behind the wheel, he asked, \u201cWhat the hell is an AYW-ID?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s when you look at a man and think, \u2018Anything you want, I\u2019ll do.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d He turned on the engine, then nodded at the brown paper bag clutched in her hands. \u201cIn that case, tell me what\u2019s in the sack?\u201d</p><p>Oh, heavens. \u201cNothing interesting.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Standing in his bedroom, Sam smothered a grin. Linda was seated in the center of his king-size bed. Naked. As she\u2019d tried to remove her skintight latex shirt, he\u2019d discovered she knew a fair number of interesting curses.</p> <p>When she looked up at him, her big brown eyes held more than a hint of anxiety. But although some of the alcohol had worn off, she still wasn\u2019t completely sober, and he didn\u2019t beat on drunken masochists. He needed her either capable of using her safe word or for her body language to not be muddled.</p><p>Didn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t have a good time though. He\u2019d spent part of the afternoon adding chains to the frame of his bed. Rope would have been easier, but nothing beat the clinking of chains when a submissive yanked on them. Yeah.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to play now?\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind that I\u2019m on the drunken side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He liked seeing her like this, relaxed. A little giggly. No haunting worries visible in those eyes\u2014none but what he put there. He winked at her. \u201cI intend to enjoy the hell out of it.\u201d</p><p>He buckled her into leather wrist and ankle cuffs. Maybe he\u2019d leave them on. Nice easy access in the morning.</p><p>After shoving a thick foam wedge under her ass, he chained her arms to the upper posts, leaving her legs free.</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d She took a gulping breath as she tested the restraints.</p><p>\u201cChains and bedposts. Just call me old-fashioned.\u201d He curved his hand under her jaw and kissed her, not viciously but rougher than normal. Giving her a hint at what would be coming.</p><p>The way her breathing sped up was damned appealing.</p><p>He put a tweezers clamp on her left nipple, tightening until she whined, then backing off quite a bit since her sensitivity might be impaired. After doing the left, he stopped to kiss her and remind her who he was. Being intoxicated could let old fears surface. She needed to see him, hear him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to hurt me?\u201d she whispered, her expression half-worried, half-eager.</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d Mostly when the clamps came off. But she wouldn\u2019t be thinking about pain by then. He picked up his handmade cunt-spreader setup. \u201cSpread your legs, girl.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened at the clamps dangling from the two Velcro straps. \u201cWhat are those?\u201d</p><p>Under his stare, she slowly moved her legs apart.</p><p>When he dropped the straps next to her hip, she caught on to where he intended to put those clamps.</p><p>He smothered a grin when she started to bring her legs together to cover her vulnerable pussy bits.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She stopped, legs still apart. When he traced a finger over her inner thigh, she shivered. Damn, but she had delicate skin. Soft. So white he knew the sun\u2019s rays had never touched it.</p><p>For his own enjoyment, he teased her for a while until she was pleasingly wet and squirming. Then he wrapped a wide strap around each upper thigh as high as he could get. Out of her sight, he plugged in his favorite toy and set it conveniently at hand on the floor.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what you got tonight.\u201d He picked up the brown paper bag she\u2019d forgotten in the truck.</p><p>Her face turned a satisfying red, then outraged. \u201cLeave that bag alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Once he had a look at what she\u2019d bought, he\u2019d know what to do about her legs. He pulled out a tiny bottle. Orange-flavored lubricant? He snorted, remembering Gabi\u2019s surprise when she\u2019d given him a blowjob and discovered he\u2019d used an orange-flavored condom.</p><p>After tossing it onto the bed, he found the next toy. A long, thin vibrator that curved upward to a flat, ribbed tip. He studied it a minute, then realized the shape was designed to reach the G-spot. Perfect. He gave her an amused look. \u201cYou were busy at that party, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She was so fair-skinned that her blush reached a bright red. \u201cThose are my toys. Not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to use them on me, missy.\u201d</p><p>The last thing in the bag was... He grinned. No wonder she\u2019d worried.</p><p>Her eyes widened when he held it up. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The anal plug was also a vibrator. Even had batteries already installed. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than I\u2019d have chosen for you.\u201d</p><p>Her voice came out nicely higher than normal. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose it. It was a prize. And it\u2019s huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll fit...with a little work.\u201d</p><p>The chains clanked as she yanked on them. Trying not to laugh, he figured out the scenario and what to do with her legs. Hell, this was going to be fun.</p><p>HE WOULDN\u2019T REALLY stick that thing up her butt, would he? Linda pulled on the restraints, wanting to put her hands over her vulnerable asshole.</p><p>The clamps on her breasts were throbbing with a growing heat. But...what about those straps around her thighs? Did he really intend to use those horrible-looking clamps on her pussy? She saw him squirt lube on the anal plug, and her voice came out sounding strangled. \u201cSam.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, he set it down.</p><p>She let out a sigh of relief. He wasn\u2019t going to\u2014</p><p>He picked up a chain fastened to the headboard, then lifted her left leg. A snick connected her ankle cuff and the chain. Her leg was raised, pointing toward her head. Elevated by the wedge pillow, her bottom now tilted upward. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, missy, you know the answer to that.\u201d The cool calculation in his eyes made her quake. She was still fuzzy-minded from the alcohol; he definitely was not. He bent her right knee and chained that ankle to the side of the bed, then squeezed her thigh. Just the strength in his powerful hand sent a tremor through her. \u201cDon\u2019t want you to kick at me when I do this.\u201d</p><p>This? When she saw him pick up the anal plug, she realized he\u2019d positioned her legs so he could easily reach her asshole. \u201cYou bastard. I don\u2019t want any anal stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe word is red, girl.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou call me any more names, and I\u2019ll gag you.\u201d</p><p>She choked the next curse back, almost strangling herself, and it was a good thing that he\u2019d chained her other leg, since she\u2019d have definitely kicked him.</p><p>He studied her, waiting to see if she\u2019d safe word. Then one corner of his mouth tipped up.</p><p>Safe word, you fool. But her apprehension was balanced by anticipation; she wanted everything he\u2019d do to her. Wanted his hands on her. Didn\u2019t want anything to stop. But that plug... Her inner voice was whining up a storm and got louder when she felt him push the plug against her anus.</p><p>Every muscle on her backside tightened in denial. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His icy eyes met hers. \u201cI have bigger plugs. If I have to work hard to put one in, I might as well use one that will make you yell.\u201d His palm hit her bottom with a resounding slap.</p><p>Like fireworks, the stinging sparkled into beauty. The buzzing alcohol in her veins made it even better. A sigh escaped as the feeling faded.</p><p>\u201cRelax and push out, or I\u2019ll see how big of a plug you can take.\u201d His expression was...amused. He enjoyed making her anxious. He\u2019d like making her yell. A quiver ran through her that held more need than fear. Gritting her teeth, she complied.</p><p>\u201cThat a girl.\u201d His gravelly laugh raised goose bumps on her arms. He started to work the plug in, pushing, easing out, pushing.</p><p>It felt so depraved, so sinfully carnal, having him see her, touch her in such a private place. And as he played with her, his deep, focused gaze wandered from her face and down her body to where his hand pushed the plug against her anus.</p><p>Her nipples tried to peak, making the clamps pinch harder. Her voice came out shaky. \u201cPlease. Just...just put it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafer for you if I go slow and stretch you out.\u201d His eyes gleamed. \u201cBesides, I like drawing it out.\u201d</p><p>Her attempt to kick him earned her a swat on her ass.</p><p>The burn expanded into a sharp pleasure, quickening her breathing.</p><p>He continued. Each advance of the plug stretched and burned, reaching a disconcerting, erotic tightness. Then it plopped into place.</p><p>She closed her eyes and squirmed, feeling as if it were pushing all the way to her tonsils. Too full, too much.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, girl.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met his merciless ones. \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you while that\u2019s in your ass.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. He was so big. With the plug... Terror and lust made her shiver.</p><p>A crease appeared in his cheek, but the way he brushed his knuckles over her cheek was heart-stoppingly tender.</p><p>After he unrestrained the leg chained to the headboard, he clipped it to a chain on the edge of the bed. When he finished, her arms were still restrained over her head, her knees were raised, and her ankles pulled toward the sides of the mattress. The high wedge tilted her crotch embarrassingly high in the air...and rubbed on the plug. She tried to lift up. Didn\u2019t work.</p><p>He settled between her knees. \u201cBeen looking forward to tasting you all night.\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed even as her bones went limp.</p><p>He bent forward and ran his tongue over her pussy before his lips closed around her clit. She\u2019d already been aroused from everything he\u2019d done, and she gasped as an inferno lit inside her. His tongue flickered over the top of her clit. Then he sucked, licked, sucked. Her insides coiled, and as she clenched, the plug set off odd sensations, sending her higher. The pressure built and suddenly, without warning, she came.</p><p>So quick. As she recovered her breath, she frowned. All that work for a fast orgasm?</p><p>Expecting him to let her loose, she realized he was adjusting the Velcro strap on her right thigh. He picked up one of the clamps that dangled from thick twine. Oh, heck, she\u2019d forgotten that thing. Her legs involuntarily tried to close and got nowhere.</p><p>Something bit like teeth on her right labia and kept biting. \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d put the clamp on her down there. Another clamp went on next to the first. Her back arched as the stinging expanded, billowing upward through her body, changing into liquid heat.</p> <p>One more. And then he started on the left labia.</p><p>Her entire pussy was a river of pain, filled with an unstoppable current of pleasure, taking her out of herself. Leaving her adrift like a paddleless canoe.</p><p>Leaving her in Sam\u2019s control. As her eyes met his, she let go and let herself be swept away.</p><p>After a minute\u2014hours, years\u2014she felt a tugging down there. She lifted her head.</p><p>He was tightening the thick twine between the clamps and the thigh straps, pulling her labia open to expose her entrance and clit. A cool wash of air brushed over normally hidden places and contrasted with the burn of the clamps circling them.</p><p>\u201cLike those, do you?\u201d He was studying her reactions, his gaze moving again from her face to her breasts, her hands, her body. His eyes were the same blue as in the hottest part of a flame. \u201cSay my name, Linda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d Her voice was breathless but clear enough to gain a smile.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>How could she need his approval so much? Want it and work for it? But she did.</p><p>He slid the small dildo-vibrator inside her vagina, angling it, and set it to a low hum. The vibrations didn\u2019t feel like anything special...until he leaned down and licked over her clit.</p><p>Oh mercy. With the touch of his tongue, the nub felt as if it were being teased from two sides. As it swelled, she felt as if its size was doubling or even tripling.</p><p>Sam tormented her clit, circling up and over, forcing Linda back into arousal as if she\u2019d never come a few minutes before. Her body\u2019s attempt to move, to tighten, pulled on the labia clamps. The burst of pain soared right into sheer bliss with not a second between.</p><p>As she shuddered, her hips strained to lift to his mouth. The sensations came too fast to process, shoving her up and up until her body contracted like a fist as the fireworks of an orgasm shot upward, then sparkled through every cell inside her. So magnificent.</p><p>As she floated down to earth, she felt the bed under her, the aching in her nipples and labia. She opened her eyes. \u201cHeavens, that was...\u201d She frowned at the laughter in his eyes as he turned off the vibrator. \u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust more of the same, missy. Nothing special.\u201d</p><p>More? She\u2019d come twice in only a few minutes, and her heart still hammered. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward between her knees to lick her breasts and nibble on the compressed peaks before pushing her breasts together.</p><p>As the teeth of the clamps dug into her areolae, she groaned. He continued.</p><p>By the time he finished, a freeway of electricity sizzled up and down between her pussy and her breasts, and heat wafted upward from her skin as if her blood was boiling inside her veins.</p><p>He sat back on his heels, studied her for a second, and grinned. \u201cReady for another round?\u201d</p><p>She was. How could she want more?</p><p>Nodding as if she\u2019d answered, he flipped the G-spot vibrator to a setting that created a roller coaster, up and down, of vibrations.</p><p>When his mouth closed on her clit, she jumped. Too much, too sensitive.</p><p>Ignoring her squirming attempts to evade his tongue, he mercilessly worked her up, rubbing the sides. Toying with her.</p><p>The restraints held her limbs still, the wedge tilted her up. Clamps on her pussy held her so open. Every step he\u2019d taken had left her more exposed, positioned right where he could force her to come for his own enjoyment. The bone-deep knowledge that he was playing with her, doing just as he wanted, sent her arousal spiraling out of control. \u201cSam,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He lifted his head, meeting her gaze, the demand in his expression perfectly clear. Give me everything.</p><p>The breath she pulled in shuddered through her, feeling as if it cracked something deep inside her.</p><p>His diamond-blue gaze warmed. Leaning down, he took her clit between his lips and sucked on the tip as hard as he did on her breasts.</p><p>\u201cAaaaaah!\u201d Her back arched, held, held, as the orgasm blasted through her without finesse, without mercy. Her arms tugged on the chains. Then she went limp. A fine sweat covered her body, chilling her as it cooled.</p><p>Sitting back, he flicked the vibrator off. His hands were warm as he stroked her hips. \u201cPretty Linda.\u201d His gaze ran over her as he smiled.</p><p>Her pulse was roaring in her head, and each heaving breath pulled on the clamps. The alcohol was definitely gone.</p><p>He pulled his shirt off. Such broad shoulders. A muscular chest with a six-pack that a twenty-year-old would envy. All man. And with an erection that bulged his jeans. Why wasn\u2019t he inside her? Satisfying his own need.</p><p>She swallowed against a dry throat. \u201cCan I... Will you let me please you?\u201d Everything in her wanted to give him the same joy he gave her. Making him happy satisfied her in ways she\u2019d never be able to describe. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn, honey. I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d Trying to entice him, she licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d His eyes held hers. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when you\u2019ve come enough.\u201d He played with the vibrator settings, choosing one with a continuous heavy buzz.</p><p>She could feel it, enjoy it, but her body was finished and not reacting. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s it for me, Sam. Let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sure it\u2019s not.\u201d He lifted a...thing...from the floor. A giant vibrator with a mushroom head the size of a girl\u2019s fist.</p><p>After turning it on, he pressed the head lightly between the labia clamps and against her exposed clit.</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d The vibrations were so intense her clit felt zapped by jolts of electricity.</p><p>As he rolled it back and forth, everything in her clenched and, like a flash fire, exploded into a brutal orgasm. Her scream echoed off the walls.</p><p>He turned everything off.</p><p>She felt as if her body was sinking into the mattress. Perspiration had wet the hair at her temples and behind her neck. \u201cI\u2019m done. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>He did it again. She came.</p><p>And again. She came. Oh God. She groaned as she roused from the last orgasm. How could something feel so good that her whole body ached? Her voice came out a moan. \u201cCan\u2019t. No m-more left.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes held an evil satisfaction as he studied her trembling body. \u201cI think there is.\u201d</p><p>She tried to move, to escape, and couldn\u2019t. The restraints held her open to anything he wanted to do, whether getting her off or hurting her. The knowledge set up a separate pulse of desire, a low chant saying, Use me, take me, do what you will.</p><p>Damn, damn sadist...and Dom. His hard lips curved as he watched her futile attempts, head tilted as if he could hear the yielding voice inside her. Yes, he\u2019d make her take until he decided to stop.</p><p>Why did knowing that set her insides fluttering with more than anxiety? The part of her that was still thinking protested, \u201cSam, really.\u201d</p><p>He reached between her legs, and the anal plug sprang to life with wicked vibrations. Every nerve between her butt cheeks blasted awake, an entirely new region of sensation. Her thigh muscles trembled as her need for more, for something, grew to unbearable.</p><p>When he pressed the vibrator to her clit, it ignited an explosion that ripped her right from the world as she came in long, almost painful rolls of pleasure.</p><p>After a while, she could hear herself sucking in air. She blinked and tried to focus. Sweat had drenched her body, trickling under her breasts and arms. \u201cPlease. No more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe word?\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>A shiver ran through her. She wanted...wanted whatever he did.</p><p>A crease appeared in his cheek as he set the vibrator on the bed and switched off the anal plug. \u201cThink I\u2019m ready to fuck you now, girl.\u201d</p><p>An uncontrollable tremor rolled through her body. When his eyes gleamed, her insides quivered even more. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, just to hear herself protest...and to watch him ignore it.</p><p>Smoothly, he slid the G-spot vibrator out of her and set it to one side. When he opened his jeans, she swallowed. His cock was far bigger than the thin vibrator, and he hadn\u2019t removed the anal plug. He pressed the tip of his shaft against her entrance. With the labia clamps on, nothing blocked his way. Balanced on one arm, he worked in with incremental thrusts.</p><p>Everything felt too, too tight. Her body was stretched out, her arms chained. She couldn\u2019t move, no matter what he did, and she felt her excitement increase at the knowledge. \u201cYou don\u2019t fit.\u201d</p><p>His smile was...sadistic. \u201cYou\u2019ll take me to the hilt, missy. Even if it hurts.\u201d He gave her a level, implacable gaze that shot lust straight to her core. \u201cEspecially if it hurts.\u201d</p><p>As he stared down into her eyes, openly savoring her discomfort, currents of excitement sizzled through her.</p><p>Slowly, inevitably, he impaled her, continuing until his groin rubbed against the labia clamps. The glorious heat from the pinching soon engulfed the throbbing at her entrance.</p><p>He reached under her to start the anal plug again. With him filling her so completely, the vibrations shook through her whole lower half, and she gasped at the overwhelming sensations pulsing through her.</p><p>\u201cDamned tight.\u201d He kissed her, driving his tongue into her mouth as ferociously as he started pounding his cock into her body.</p><p>He thrust in and out, filling her pussy, emptying her. The multitude of input\u2014vibrators, clamps, his mouth, his cock\u2014rang through her like a tolling bell, confusing her, driving her up again.</p><p>Every slick slide of his cock preceded the feeling of being filled to discomfort. His weight was heavy on her hips. She breathed in the clean outdoors scent of him as he kissed her deeply, making her feel thoroughly possessed. Restrained, pressed down, filled everywhere. The shivery knowledge was like bubbles racing through her.</p><p>She felt his body start to tighten. Oh yes. She loved feeling him come, seeing the satisfaction on his face. Nothing compared to making this man happy.</p><p>\u201cOne more,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Without answering, he lifted up slightly and removed her left breast clamp. After a second of almost relief, the agony of blood rushing into the abused flesh made her arch and suck in air. Insidious pleasure wove tendrils between the pain until she wasn\u2019t sure what she felt. Her insides clenched down against his thickness, against the vibrations of the anal plug, and she shot into arousal and need as if a rocket had gone off.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good girl.\u201d He stared into her eyes as he slid his cock out, and then he removed the other clamp.</p><p>She felt every little prong pull away from her nipple. The shocking influx of blood turned to the most exquisite pulsing, and her body clenched again. The anal plug vibrated, but she was empty...</p><p>Laughing under his breath, he slammed his cock home. Her back tried to arch against his heavy weight as her entire body filled with searing, scalding pleasure, filled and overflowed, cascading into an unstoppable climax. Oh God. Wave after wave of sensation rushed through her until her hair and fingers zinged with the orgasm.</p><p>Heaven help me; I\u2019m going to die just from a climax. She tried to glare at him, but even her eyelids felt limp. And he was still hard inside her, moving in and out slowly. The realization sent a shudder through her.</p><p>\u201cHoney. Not coming?\u201d Her words sounded slurred.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d His gravelly chuckle was soft against her ear. \u201cWhen you get off again.\u201d</p><p>Her body had died. For sure, this time. \u201cNot happening.\u201d Regret at disappointing him made her breath hitch. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The creases at the corners of his eyes deepened, and the look he gave her tugged at her heart. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, girl.\u201d He nipped her chin, then rubbed his chest against her oversensitive nipples, sending pain zinging down to her clit. Her insides tightened around him and the plug. Somehow, without dislodging himself, he sat back onto his knees, withdrawing until his cock was barely inside her.</p><p>Cool air wafted over her damp skin, and her nipples tightened again, increasing the burn. The delight.</p><p>He ran a finger over her sensitive clit, making her jump, and she clenched again. His smile showed his enjoyment at controlling her responses...and that he knew exactly what he was doing to her. \u201cOh, I think you\u2019ve got another orgasm in there,\u201d he said, and his laugh held a cruel, wonderful edge that took her breath away.</p><p>Her pulse felt like a throbbing in her lower half. He wouldn\u2019t\u2014he couldn\u2019t make her come again. She\u2019d die. She yanked on her arm restraints. \u201cNot again. Please, I can\u2019t take it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d</p><p>Every sensitive bit on her body felt raw with sensation, like she was getting a continuous delicious whipping. \u201cIt\u2019s too much,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His eyes lit. \u201cThen this will top you off.\u201d Still on his knees, he held her gaze as he reached down...and pulled off a labia clamp. She had only a moment to realize what he\u2019d done before he slammed his cock in. Hard. Deep. Pain blasted through her as blood churned back into her labia. Then it all zipped into an unholy pleasure. Her pussy tightened around his slick cock, feeling so, so good.</p><p>He picked up the huge vibrator and touched her clit.</p><p>The vibrations blasted straight to her core, impacting the pulsations from the plug in her ass. She shuddered at the flood of sensations.</p><p>He pulled his shaft out and lifted the vibrator away.</p><p>She managed to pull in a breath.</p><p>Until he removed another labial clamp and rammed his thick cock in. The vibrator went back onto her clit.</p><p>Before, just before she could come, he pulled his cock back. The vibrator up.</p><p>She was panting.</p><p>The next clamp came off...and the cycle started again. Again and again and again.</p><p>She broke, exploding so hard that her hips bucked in protest, every muscle seized into rigidity. Like a volcano, heat erupted into sheer ecstasy, searing through every nerve.</p><p>He\u2019d dropped forward onto one arm. His sandpaper laugh scraped in her ear as he pounded into her, deep and deeper, until his cock jerked, adding to the unending vibrations inside her. He came, long and long. As his fingers twined with hers, he kissed her with a rumbling groan of satisfaction that added to her own. She\u2019d pleased him.</p><p>Ever so gradually, the waves inside her receded. The ringing in her ears faded. She was still panting, unsure if she\u2019d ever achieve a normal breath again. Her heart felt like when Charles had learned to drum, hammering the house with erratic noise. When she managed to open her eyes, Sam was staring down at her, his face as gentle as she\u2019d ever seen it.</p><p>After giving her a light kiss, he took a deep breath that rubbed his chest against her incredibly sensitive nipples and made her moan.</p><p>Slowly, he pulled out. When the anal vibrator switched off and was removed, her body could only twitch.</p><p>One by one, he unfastened the chains from her legs and arms. When he pulled her arms down, she groaned and gritted her teeth. Sore joints were not a good pain.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d As his powerful hands massaged the ache from her shoulders, her body felt as if it was oozing down into the bed, drenched in satiation. Her emotions felt the same way. He was being so careful with her. Evil sadist had turned to lover.</p><p>\u201cHurt too much anywhere?\u201d His fingers trailed over her body, his warm gaze checking for any damage. \u201cTell me, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh-uhhh. Fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d With gentle, unwavering hands, he rolled her onto her side and curled behind her. His legs tangled with hers; his chest warmed her back. \u201cSleep, girl,\u201d he growled in her ear.</p><p>When she\u2019d been a child, an elderly neighbor\u2019s dog had growled at her constantly. She\u2019d been terrified until the owner explained the noise was Bruno\u2019s way of talking. Light growls, low growls, chompy growls. Even happy growls. She\u2019d discovered that the local bullies never appeared when Bruno walked her to school...growling the entire way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d sounded just like Sam.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>On a worn-smooth wooden pew, Linda sat in the church waiting for the ceremony to begin. She\u2019d been disappointed when Sam had called to tell her to go on to Jessica and Z\u2019s wedding without him. Nonetheless, she was delighted to be present.</p><p>How could anyone not love the ritual when a couple formally began their life together? For that one moment, no second thoughts were allowed to intrude. Even the air in the church seemed filled with joyful anticipation.</p><p>She smiled. She\u2019d been so young when she and Frederick had married. If she\u2019d waited to gain a bit more experience, perhaps she\u2019d have made a wiser choice. But then she wouldn\u2019t have Brenna and Charles. And really, her marriage had been more happy than sad.</p><p>A gurgle of laughter came from beside her. Having defeated the other submissives, Sally cuddled Zane, Kari\u2019s adorable baby. He was having a wonderful time tugging on her long hair. Tanner, the male trainee, had squeezed closer, obviously awaiting his chance to snatch the baby for himself.</p><p>The rest of the row was filled with all the single Shadowlands submissives who weren\u2019t serving as bridesmaids. The club had shown up in force, filling the church with the wonderful diversity of the membership\u2014not only a range of ethnicities, but also the wide variety of sexual, gender, and relationship choices.</p><p>Obviously, Z wasn\u2019t ashamed of his friends. Linda shook her head. Once they married, would Z and Jessica still manage to balance the BDSM side of their lives with the vanilla world?</p><p>In the bridal suite, Jessica looked at herself in the mirror. Thank God, Gabi was an expert with makeup. Jessica\u2019s hands had been shaking so hard that she\u2019d have ended up with mascara everywhere...and probably have poked her eye out with the wand. \u201cI\u2019m getting married,\u201d she told herself.</p><p>Her bridesmaids burst into laughter, and Andrea added, \u201cNo. Really?\u201d</p><p>Jessica turned on the chair. Damn, she loved these women\u2014the submissives of the Shadowlands Masters. It had seemed so appropriate that their groomsmen and bridesmaids would be the attached couples in the Masters. Kari and Dan, Beth and Nolan, Andrea and Cullen, Gabi and Marcus, Kim and Raoul. She gave them a watery smile.</p><p>Beth set her hands on her hips. \u201cDon\u2019t you start that crying business. Gabi already put her makeup kit away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ma\u2019am. I won\u2019t, Ma\u2019am.\u201d Jessica grinned at Beth. \u201cYou were such a cute Mistress at the party. What did Nolan say when he saw you all Dommed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said I was cute too. But then he wanted to see if I could dominate him. As if.\u201d The slender redhead rubbed her bottom. \u201cDon\u2019t ever let Z get one of those evil stick things. That thwap really hurts.\u201d</p><p>As everyone laughed, Jessica heard Z outside the bridal room. Even after two years, she still got quivers when she heard his deep voice.</p><p>In the hallway, her mother said something that sounded like a protest.</p><p>Z answered firmly. \u201cThis is a tradition also.\u201d Ignoring the sputtering response, he walked past her mother and Aunt Eunice into the room and set a large gift bag on the floor. When he spotted Jessica, still in her underwear, his eyes warmed. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely lovely, kitten.\u201d</p><p>Under his gaze... She felt beautiful.</p><p>He glanced at the women. \u201cGive us a few minutes, please.\u201d No matter how politely phrased, it was a command from a Dom to a group of submissives.</p><p>Without a word, they disappeared into the hallway where her mother was having a whisperfest with Eunice.</p><p>What in the world was going on? \u201cZachary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry again.\u201d His eyes had turned a dark gray that melted her insides.</p><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d</p> <p>The corners of his eyes crinkled\u2014the best reward she\u2019d ever found. He rested his hands on her shoulders. \u201cWe decided you\u2019d receive your submissive collar in the wedding ceremony instead of a separate one. Since we\u2019re not in a formal Master/slave relationship, that seemed right.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. They\u2019d had a long discussion about how to integrate everything.</p><p>\u201cBut I decided I want more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>He lifted her to her feet. His faint smile and the glint in his eyes sent a tremor deep into her bones. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Jessica. My submissive. My wife. And the ceremony makes the spouse role more important than the submissive.\u201d He opened the bag he\u2019d brought into the room and took out a...</p><p>\u201cA corset?\u201d A new one of pure white lace and satin that would go from her breasts to her hips and as beautiful in its own way as her wedding dress.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d His gaze darkened. \u201cStrip, please.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>At the slight rise of his chin, she hurriedly pulled off her silky bra and thong.</p><p>\u201cHands up.\u201d As he wrapped the corset around her, she frowned at the perfect fit. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wedding gown seamstress used your other corset as a guide and changed your wedding dress accordingly.\u201d</p><p>No wonder the woman had that odd gleam in her eyes during the last fitting.</p><p>Z laced up the corset far more quickly than any man should. With a darkly wicked chuckle, he said, \u201cBrace yourself, little one.\u201d</p><p>She felt tugging and more tugging as the corset tightened. And tightened. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it a minute.\u201d He patted her bottom. \u201cMove around the room.\u201d</p><p>As she walked, the corset loosened or maybe her insides were being squashed up against her lungs.</p><p>After a couple of minutes, he horrified her by tightening the laces until she could only squeak. With firm hands, he turned her around to face him, and his face held the stern, caring expression that had dropped her heart at his feet on the first night they\u2019d met. \u201cThe way you look at me... I love you, Jessica.\u201d</p><p>To gain his approval, she would let him lace her to the width of a beanpole.</p><p>His gaze heated. Then he shook his head. \u201cRavishing the bride before the wedding would be bad form.\u201d A crease appeared in his cheek as he ran his finger along the top of the corset where her breasts were pressed upward into X-rated exposure. \u201cHopefully the tailor calculated correctly, or you\u2019ll give the preacher a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>The warmth of his fingers seared her skin, slid deep inside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to freeing these pretty breasts and then taking you. Hard. And easy. And slow. And fast. All night.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as her insides turned to lava, and she dampened. Where was that thong, by the way? She\u2019d definitely need to wear\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo underwear, Jessica.\u201d</p><p>What? Her eyes opened to meet her Master\u2019s steel-gray gaze. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you walk down the aisle to me\u2014and for the rest of the evening\u2014you\u2019ll feel the tightness of the corset that I laced you into,\u201d he said, his voice deeper, authority resonating with every word. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel the control I have over you. Over your body...and your life.\u201d He brushed her lips with his, leaving her wanting more. \u201cThe collar I\u2019ll put on you will be the outward symbol that you\u2019re mine. But as with all power exchanges, the real truth is buried deep within, just as this symbol of my control is hidden from the world under your dress. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>As if something had slid into place, she felt...right. Balanced. Even if he wasn\u2019t beside her, he still exerted his control. \u201cI love you, Master.\u201d</p><p>Due to a downed fence and scattered cattle, Sam had told Linda to go to the wedding without him since he\u2019d be late. He came in the church\u2019s side door and took a seat at the end of the third row as quietly as possible. Looked like he\u2019d arrived in good time. A shame he\u2019d missed seeing the bride come down the aisle though.</p><p>Stretching out his legs, he watched as the ceremony proceeded with both dignity and warmth, quite typical of Z yet with some of Jessica\u2019s exuberance.</p><p>The Dom had done well in selecting his mate. Had gone slow after meeting her. Sam knew Z hadn\u2019t wanted to push his lover into a commitment, especially since he was older. But she was thirty, and a woman usually knew her own mind by then. Jessica might be submissive, but she assuredly had her own strong opinions.</p><p>As the couple exchanged rings to the usual vows, the bride radiated happiness.</p><p>Sam sighed, feeling on the older side. Jessica had been delightful as she ventured into the club, into the lifestyle, and into a relationship. Although they\u2019d started with playing in the bedroom, Z\u2019s dominance had slowly extended outward. They hadn\u2019t ended up with a Master/slave relationship, but the D/s dynamic was definitely part of their everyday lives.</p><p>He had to admit to feeling some envy.</p><p>His ex-wife had regarded BDSM with loathing, and he\u2019d never tried to change her mind. But in the Shadowlands, he saw what he\u2019d missed as the couples worked out what fit them. Some had gone from Master/slave to a limited power exchange; some went the other way.</p><p>As he glanced across the aisle, his gaze fell on the row of submissives who weren\u2019t bridesmaids. All were beaming, some in tears. Why did women cry at these things? Uzuri, Dara, and Rainie sat in a line. Sally was bouncing Kari\u2019s baby on her knee, while Tanner diverted the boy with the BDSM symbol on his keychain. Next to Sally was... Sam straightened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Linda. Like a typical female, she\u2019d primped up. Rather than the heavy makeup she\u2019d worn at the bachelorette party, today she\u2019d gone for quiet and classy. Her hair had grown long enough for her to pull it back in some complicated braid. Her dark green dress hugged her curves and made her skin glow.</p><p>He wished she were sitting beside him.</p><p>In front of the altar, Cullen handed Z a glittering strand\u2014a necklace\u2014and Sam blinked in surprise. Z planned to collar Jessica in front of vanilla guests? That took balls.</p><p>\u201cThis chain of links is a symbol of the events that drew us together.\u201d As Z held up a choker of diamond-encrusted links, his lips quirked. \u201cFrom a car in a ditch to you rescuing women and me rescuing you.\u201d</p> <p>Sam heard suppressed laughter at the reminder of how Jessica would charge in if she felt another submissive was in trouble.</p><p>Jessica gazed up at Z, and her voice was soft but steady. \u201cSince I don\u2019t have any jewelry handy\u201d\u2014she gave him a teasing look\u2014\u201cI offer you the gift of myself: heart, mind, body, and soul. I trust you\u201d\u2014everyone in the lifestyle heard the unspoken Master\u2014\u201cand I\u2019ll wear your gift with joy.\u201d Jessica\u2019s need to offer all of herself was obvious to every Dom in the room and one of the most beautiful things Sam had ever seen.</p><p>When she pulled up her hair and bent her neck, Z fastened on the necklace. He lifted her chin. \u201cKitten, I vow to be worthy of the trust you\u2019ve given me. I\u2019ll protect you, push you to grow, and cherish you with all my heart.\u201d</p><p>Z drew her into his arms, and his voice was only audible to the people in the first few rows as he murmured into her hair, \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>Even as Sam felt his eyes sting, amusement trickled through him. Apparently, he wouldn\u2019t be teasing the ladies about their tears after all.</p> <p>Linda decided the Florida weather had cooperated wonderfully with the wedding, and sunny skies reigned above Z\u2019s private gardens behind the Shadowlands. With a backdrop of purple fountain grass, a five-person band was playing oldies for the guests at tables dotting the green lawn. Linda hummed along, pleased with the selection of tunes. Thank goodness the happy couple hadn\u2019t gone for the edgy techno music played in the Shadowlands.</p><p>The area was filling with people. Only the couple\u2019s friends and family had attended the wedding, but the reception included business associates and hometown guests as well as all the Shadowlands members.</p><p>She shook her head, feeling at a loss. The ceremony had been lovely, and when they\u2019d given each other D/s vows disguised as a gift of jewelry, her heart had squeezed.</p><p>It still did, because she wanted that kind of relationship for herself and Sam. The time with him, each time with him, seemed to get more serious. He demanded more from her, and she gave it. So, so willingly. The desire to offer him...everything...was terrifying.</p><p>He cared for her. She knew it, even if he didn\u2019t speak the words. But could she give him what he wanted? Needed? He helped her scrape her house, stood up for her, and held her when she cried. He hurt her. He made love to her. What did she do for him?</p><p>He obviously liked her companionship. But she wanted to give him more than a dinner partner or someone to watch movies with. She wanted to support him. And the more she grew to care for him, the more she wanted to offer. But he was so darned self-sufficient.</p> <p>Frederick had always brought home his problems. By sharing them with her, he might not have found answers, but his burden was lightened. It had been a gift she could offer. But Sam didn\u2019t talk about his concerns. In fact, very little seemed to bother him. And she wanted not only the closeness of sharing worries, but also the joy of being able to help. To comfort and support.</p><p>Her chest tightened. Over the past couple of weeks, she\u2019d realized she had an insecurity, something new since her kidnapping. Another one, dammit. But she couldn\u2019t ignore the fact that she wanted Sam to talk to her. No one could possibly be more supportive than he was, yet sometimes she needed the actual words. Needed to hear what he felt about her, about their relationship.</p><p>Any woman would want to know how she fitted into a man\u2019s life\u2014and she\u2019d want that no matter what\u2014but she had to admit that the twisting of his silence into something ominous came from her own misgivings. Not his. The slavers had made her feel as if she were an animal. Just an object to fuck. And yes, this was her own screwed-up remnant of that experience, but...it was bothering her.</p><p>Linda shook her head, trying to turn her thoughts to something more cheerful.</p><p>On the lanai, the bride\u2019s mother and aunt and a horde of women from her small town directed the catering crew, who were still setting food and drink on linen-covered tables. Z smiled at the women, making a gesture that he was leaving them in charge, before returning to the informal reception line.</p><p>Linda turned in a circle, marveling at the setting. Jessica had chosen blue and white for her colors, and somehow Z\u2019s garden matched, from the lanai\u2019s hanging pots that spilled over with white alyssum to blue-purple hyacinths and snowflake blooms in the flower gardens. Amazing.</p><p>\u201cHey, Linda.\u201d Wearing a deep red, ruched satin sheath with a plunging neckline, Sally crossed the lawn.</p><p>Linda grinned. \u201cI really like that gown\u2014and your versatility. I\u2019ve seen you in braids and a schoolgirl uniform, then dressed as a Domme for the bachelorette party, and now you look incredibly sophisticated.\u201d</p> <p>Sally gave her a mischievous grin. \u201cI get bored easily.\u201d In much the way that Linda had, she looked back and forth from the nearby cluster of bridesmaids to the matching gardens. \u201cBeth did good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Z was one of her first big clients, and she busted her butt to make the Shadowlands and his private gardens special. Before, the place was pretty, but all formal. Squares and straight lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say she paid him back for his trust,\u201d Linda murmured. She\u2019d never seen anything so luxuriant. Even without moving, she glimpsed curving garden paths, splashing fountains, more flower beds, and small, intimate nooks. \u201cIt\u2019s like a fantasy garden.\u201d</p><p>Overhearing, Beth turned from the bridesmaids and beamed. \u201cExactly what I was trying to achieve.\u201d She walked over. \u201cBut don\u2019t tell Z, okay? Fantasy sounds far too feminine.\u201d</p><p>As Sally giggled, Linda choked on a laugh. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan and I had our wedding here,\u201d Beth said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see it used that way again.\u201d</p><p>Linda followed Beth\u2019s gaze to her husband. She still had trouble believing the slender redhead had married the cruel-looking man. But while Jessica was saying her vows, Beth had blown a kiss at Nolan, and his cold black eyes had warmed, his face softened.</p><p>I envy her.</p><p>Linda\u2019s marriage to Frederick had been stable, but he hadn\u2019t accepted who she was. To see these loving Dominant/submissive relationships was heartening.</p><p>And attending the reception had certain other benefits. \u201cI must say, the gardens are lovely, but the human scenery is also rather fine.\u201d Her gaze wandered to the lanai where the Masters were talking. How the black tuxedoes could make the men look even bigger, she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Standing with the groomsmen, Sam wore a classic cut, dark gray suit with a white dress shirt and a silver-gray tie that matched his hair. Did the man have to look so dangerously sexy in every darn thing he wore?</p><p>\u201cYou must be looking at Sam.\u201d Snickering, Beth mimicked wiping drool off her chin. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I reacted when I first saw Nolan in a suit.\u201d</p><p>Linda\u2019s cheeks warmed. But...wow. The tailoring was superb, showing off his broad shoulders and flat stomach. She had a craving to undress him like a gift-wrapped present. Push his jacket open. Undo the shirt buttons. Run her finger down the deep line between his pectoral muscles. His eyes would light with amusement as if lit by the sun. Maybe he\u2019d grip her hair, firmly push her to her knees, and direct her to free his cock. She\u2019d take him in her mouth. Maybe he\u2019d give her that look she\u2019d never seen him use on anyone else\u2014the one that softened his hard features and made his mouth curve just the slightest bit.</p><p>God, she loved the man. Love? She pressed a hand over the stuttering heart that had betrayed her into acting like an idiot in a romance novel. Love between Mr. Sadistic Rancher and Ms. Conservative Businesswoman. Right. How would a relationship between them even work? She still hadn\u2019t figured out how to balance her life as it was.</p><p>Then again, love was love. It didn\u2019t exactly conform to a person\u2019s schedule. Her lips curved. Love. Terrifying, yet what a wonderful gift.</p><p>Her eyebrows rose when a woman walked up to the Masters and took Sam\u2019s hand. Just like that. Sam\u2019s smile flashed. When he touched the woman\u2019s cheek, almost affectionately, Linda felt the bottom of her stomach drop.</p><p>Cold crept up her spine, and then she forced it down. There were lots of Shadowlands people here, and she knew...had seen him play with other women.</p><p>I don\u2019t want him to do that. But at the pond, he\u2019d stated they wouldn\u2019t share. Her chest loosened, letting her breathe. She watched him. The woman might want more\u2014he\u2019s mine, darn you\u2014but that touch was all Sam had given her. And she wasn\u2019t getting his \u201cspecial\u201d smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou look funny. Are you all right?\u201d Sally asked.</p><p>Linda jumped. She\u2019d forgotten she wasn\u2019t alone. Beth had returned to the bridesmaids\u2019 group, but Sally remained. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Just saw something that unsettled me a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know that feeling,\u201d Sally muttered. She glanced around the open area, crowded with friends and family, then nodded to a cluster of Shadowlands members. \u201cI\u2019ve played with a lot of those guys. Usually had fun. But now and then, you get a Dom who\u2019s a real dickhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Linda frowned. Raoul had made the place sound so safe. \u201cIn the Shadowlands?\u201d</p> <p>Sally scowled. \u201cMaster Z tries, but jerks still get in. Like one guy who just wanted blowjobs. He\u2019d do what a sub wanted, but he wasn\u2019t interested in Domming\u2014just getting off. Or some will do whatever they want if you haven\u2019t been real clear what you\u2019ll allow.\u201d She nodded at a lean man in a black suit. \u201cThat one slapped me. I hadn\u2019t put it on my hard limits, but Doms usually start out light in the first scene, you know?\u201d</p><p>Linda studied the guy. Long nose, thin lips, sandy hair. He didn\u2019t look cruel, but she\u2019d learned from the slavers that a man\u2019s appearance didn\u2019t always indicate what lay beneath. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessica saw me crying and busted in.\u201d Sally grinned. \u201cShe got in trouble for not calling a dungeon monitor, but Z stopped the scene.\u201d She nodded at a younger, dark-haired Dom. \u201cThat one wanted his buddy to join our scene. Hey, I like threesomes but not with total strangers.\u201d</p><p>Linda shook her head. Maybe she\u2019d have enjoyed threesomes if she were younger. Amusement bubbled up. Younger and less of a stick-in-the-mud. But she was, and she didn\u2019t want anyone but Sam touching her. \u201cI can see how you\u2019d get upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Then there was a really unnerving guy who\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust one guy? Not two?\u201d When a big man stepped up behind Sally and ran his hands down her arms, Linda recognized Vance Buchanan, one of the FBI agents who\u2019d attended the trial. \u201cYou must be talking about me, pet. I\u2019m going to tell Galen that he\u2019s so boring you didn\u2019t even mention him.\u201d</p><p>Sally spun and glared at the fair-skinned man. \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about either of you.\u201d</p><p>He had a hearty laugh. \u201cYou will be, sweetie. You will be.\u201d He smiled at Linda, then strolled over to his partner, a shorter man with an olive complexion. After a brief conversation, Galen turned to regard Sally with eyes as dark as his hair.</p><p>When Sally stiffened, the man grinned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to say they do seem to unsettle you.\u201d Linda smothered a laugh.</p><p>Although Galen had resumed talking to Vance, Sally continued to stare at them. \u201cThose two. They\u2019ve got tag teaming down to a science. And they make me feel stupid. I never feel stupid. I need a drink.\u201d</p> <p>As Sally managed the impressive feat of stomping away in stilettos, Linda chuckled, then found an empty table to watch Z lead Jessica out for the first dance. They looked so perfect together that a sigh escaped.</p><p>A young man nearby grinned. \u201cWhat\u2019s it about weddings that makes chicks all gushy?\u201d</p><p>Linda huffed a laugh. He had black hair, brown eyes, and was about the same age as Charles. Her son would say exactly the same thing. \u201cWe\u2019re suckers for romance.\u201d She held her hand out. \u201cI\u2019m Linda, a friend of Jessica\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard.\u201d As they shook hands, he nodded to Z. \u201cHis son.\u201d He nudged the young man beside him. \u201cThis is my brother, Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you. They make a lovely couple,\u201d Linda said, hoping she wasn\u2019t putting her foot in it. She\u2019d seen Charles\u2019s wariness with Sam. Young men could be very territorial.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Eric shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so at first, and Mom was pissed off. But before Jessica, he used to look kinda sad. Cold.\u201d The two boys exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t pay me enough to be a shrink to messed-up kids,\u201d Richard said. \u201cHe needed her.\u201d</p><p>Eric nodded. \u201cShe makes him happy.\u201d</p> <p>Linda leaned back in her chair, brows pulling together. Jessica made Z happy; he needed her. I want Sam to need me like that.</p><p>As the newlyweds circled the grassy space, Z\u2019s expression when he looked down into Jessica\u2019s face showed so much love that Linda\u2019s eyes burned. Could I make Sam that happy?</p><p>The need to see him, to talk with him pulled at her, and she rose. Other dancers were flooding onto the grassy dance space. Gabi was scolding Marcus about something\u2014at least until he yanked her up onto her tiptoes and kissed her so thoroughly that she sagged wordlessly against him. He grinned at Raoul, who had Kim on his arm, and Raoul laughed. Kim wore a gorgeous sparkling choker\u2014a symbolic collar. Someday, when she was ready, Raoul would attach a tiny padlock and keep the key.</p><p>Z\u2019s sons had fallen into an argument about the upcoming basketball game. Linda nodded to them before making her way toward the lanai. Around her, conversations hummed, broken occasionally by Cullen\u2019s hearty laughter and giggles from the trainees, whom Sally had joined.</p><p>When Linda reached the lanai, she saw Sam on the far side of the Shadowlands Masters. Did she really want to squeeze her way through a bunch of men? Would Sam even want to see her when he was with the guys?</p><p>As she hesitated, something...a sound, a word, a voice...sent an icy hand of uneasiness up her spine. Her grandmother would have called it someone stepping on her grave. She took a step back, another, then headed the opposite direction. Kari would let her hold the baby.</p><p>Before she\u2019d reached the scattered tables, an arm curved around her waist, stopping her. \u201cYou look good.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it odd how Sam\u2019s rough voice could smooth any discomfort away? Except perhaps the uneasiness he gave her just by being himself. \u201cYou too. Who knew you could wear a suit so well?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cRather be in jeans, but this is better than the tux Nolan made me wear at his wedding.\u201d</p><p>Oh boy, the thought of him in a tux was lust inducing.</p><p>Sam\u2019s arm was firmly around her waist as he strolled with her. The feeling of being part of a couple again was wonderful.</p><p>Off to one side, an older couple stood and watched the dancing. When the white-haired man\u2019s eyes met hers, he smiled and raised his voice. \u201cSam. Introduce us.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s grin flashed. Without waiting for her to agree, he guided her forward, his big hand a warm spot at the hollow of her back. \u201cMartha, this is Linda.\u201d He glanced at Linda. \u201cThe ugly one is Gerald.\u201d</p><p>The wrinkles that softened her face couldn\u2019t hide Martha\u2019s dimples. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you. We noticed you with Sam the other night.\u201d</p><p>The other night?</p><p>\u201cAt the club,\u201d Gerald offered, obviously noticing her confusion.</p><p>Them? \u201cYou\u2019re... You do...\u201d</p><p>Martha\u2019s laugh sounded like...like Linda\u2019s mother\u2019s. \u201cYes, we do. We\u2019ve been married for decades, and he\u2019s been my Master for almost that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecades?\u201d Kinksters for most of their life?</p><p>Gerald gave a wheezing laugh. \u201cWe met when I wrote her a ticket for speeding, married soon after. Then we discovered the fun stuff about a decade after that.\u201d</p><p>Linda\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cHow in the world did you hear about BDSM? I mean, you were married. Did he take you to a club or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my, no. Clubs like the Shadowlands were impossible to find, and heterosexuals weren\u2019t welcome at most.\u201d Wrinkles curved around the old woman\u2019s smile. \u201cA friend gave me The Story of O.\u201d She tsk-tsked. \u201cThe hero showed appallingly insensitive behavior at times, but the story was fascinating. When I told Gerald, he made me read him my favorite parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe blushed with every page.\u201d Gerald kissed his wife\u2019s fingertips. \u201cWe experimented. Found a few people to answer questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were delighted when Zachary opened his club. It\u2019s pleasant knowing others in the lifestyle.\u201d Martha patted Sam\u2019s arm. \u201cDo bring her to dinner sometime.\u201d Her eyes danced. \u201cI make a mean pot roast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d Jumping right into this relationship, aren\u2019t you, girl? She looked away and took a slow breath. She was old enough to know that loving someone didn\u2019t mean you could live with him, after all. But everything in her wanted to go full speed ahead.</p><p>As Martha and Gerald responded to a hail from another older couple, Linda looked up at Sam. \u201cI should be going now. I have some accounting to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He pulled her toward the grassy dance area. \u201cHappens I like waltzing. None of that other crap. And I got a craving to feel your beautiful tits against me. In public.\u201d One eyebrow rose. \u201cEspecially with what you\u2019re wearing. Got panties on under that?\u201d</p><p>Her face warmed, and she glanced around to make sure no one was close. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s a vanilla function, I can\u2019t order you not to wear them.\u201d He mercilessly pulled her against him, closer than he should for a waltz. He had a lead as strong as his attitude, and the realization gave her a quiver of appreciation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He leaned down to murmur in her ear. \u201cBut if I find you in briefs at the Shadowlands, I\u2019ll rip them off and whip whatever parts they covered.\u201d</p><p>Despite the cool, high-sixties weather, heat blasted into Linda as if the weather had turned to a muggy July day. To hide her face, she pressed her forehead against his shoulder.</p><p>With a rumbled laugh, he said, \u201cGoddamned pants weren\u2019t tailored for a hard dick. We\u2019re dancing till I\u2019m presentable...or I\u2019ll drag you into the gardens and take care of the problem in a different way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh. I can\u2019t believe you talk like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmmh. And I can see you\u2019re upset.\u201d As he spun them in a circle, he rubbed his chest against her breasts and, even through the clothing, could undoubtedly feel how her nipples had spiked.</p><p>God, I love you. But even as she pressed closer, she knew it wasn\u2019t something he was ready to hear. Considering his past marriage, he might never be ready.</p><p>And considering how screwed up she still was? Going slowly made far too much sense.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>In the Shadowlands, Sam leaned against the bar, keeping an eye on the door. No Linda yet. His gut was coiled like a rattlesnake about to strike. Over the past couple of weeks, she\u2019d been out of town on buying trips to restock her store. The two times she\u2019d returned, he\u2019d been tied up with the construction, the groves, planting.</p><p>Was she pulling away? He snorted. Men often stepped back from a relationship after a wedding, but not women. Wouldn\u2019t that be fucked-up?</p><p>He wasn\u2019t comfortable with how much he missed talking with her. He missed her sweet body against him in bed. Missed hearing her laugh. She\u2019d given him her cell phone number, but damn. He wasn\u2019t the type to talk on a phone.</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d Wearing the gold-trimmed vest of a dungeon monitor, Jake strolled up. \u201cZ asked if you wanted to monitor the Gardens tonight.\u201d</p><p>Linda had said she\u2019d try to make it tonight. \u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere go, boys.\u201d Cullen handed Jake a bottled water and thumped one down in front of Sam before moving up the bar to mix a drink from the fancy-ass liquors.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Cullen,\u201d Jake called. He opened the bottle and regarded Sam quizzically. \u201cNever seen you play in the Capture Gardens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever will.\u201d Sam studied the man. A shame it hadn\u2019t worked out with Heather. \u201cServed in \u2019Nam. I can understand the rape fantasy. Seeing it in real life left a bad taste.\u201d</p><p>Jake lowered the bottle without drinking. \u201cI get that. Saw the aftermath a time or two.\u201d He paused for a moment, then said slowly, \u201cYou monitor the Gardens a lot.\u201d</p><p>Sam shrugged. Fantasy was fine, but there wouldn\u2019t be any real rapes happening on his watch.</p><p>As if Sam had spoken, Jake frowned. \u201cGot it.\u201d After sucking his water down, he checked his watch. \u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye on the Games for you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Good man. As the Dom strolled away, Sam watched Linda appear in the door. And there she is. The tightness in his shoulders relaxed.</p><p>Her black dress was midthigh\u2014too long\u2014but the way it clung to her ample curves left him in a forgiving mood. She was barefoot too, so Ben hadn\u2019t approved whatever shoes she\u2019d hoped to wear. She made it a few steps into the clubroom before the noise stopped her.</p><p>Sam grinned. Z and Jessica had returned from their honeymoon. The club had been closed for the two weeks they were gone, and now everyone was in a celebratory mood.</p><p>The music was an upbeat Lacuna Coil, making the scenes lighter than normal. The Mistress caning her blonde sub danced a few steps between each strike. Over at a suspension scene, the Dom had set the submissive to swinging in time with the music.</p> <p>Linda took it in, picking up the atmosphere immediately. She bounced a little herself. To Sam\u2019s satisfaction, when she spotted him, she headed over immediately.</p><p>When he caught her lavender-and-lime scent, he hardened. As he roused to the darker side of the Shadowlands, the beast inside him rose at the approach of its prey. A sadist\u2019s toy.</p><p>Her pupils dilated at the look he gave her. Under her silky black top, her nipples contracted into hard spikes.</p><p>Good. Someone wanted to play. Curving his fingers around her nape, he cupped her breast with his other hand. When his thumb circled a nipple, he saw the tension mount inside her. Damn, but he\u2019d missed her. \u201cI\u2019d order you a drink, but I\u2019d rather hurt you first.\u201d</p><p>She looked shocked. Then red streaked her cheeks.</p><p>He kissed her lightly and whispered against her mouth, \u201cSee you cry.\u201d</p><p>Her lips quivered under his.</p><p>\u201cHear you scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, heavens.\u201d Her voice was as husky as if she\u2019d already gifted him with a few screams.</p><p>He fisted her hair, keeping her in place, then tightened his fingers on one nipple, firmly enough to hear her suck in air. As he watched, he could see how the pain slid into her like a caress.</p><p>Arousal lit her eyes and darkened her lips.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He led her through the main room, down the hallway, and into the colder, crueler dungeon room. Manacles and shackles were embedded in the rock walls. Chains hung from the dark ceiling beams. A queen\u2019s throne near the back held a Mistress with a slave worshipping her feet. Whimpering came from a submissive on the bondage table who had a dominant couple taking turns with wax play. A thin male sub strapped in the leather sling groaned as his Dom fucked him hard.</p><p>Sam put his arm around Linda and pulled her close, studying her face. Anxiety and arousal, but no fear. She\u2019d come a long way in trusting him. He picked a free area and yanked on the chains dangling from a heavy beam. Sturdy. Z was as careful as any Dom he\u2019d met, but checking equipment was a habit. No submissive would suffer harm he didn\u2019t intend to give her.</p><p>Linda\u2019s gaze focused on the chain, and she jumped when he ordered, \u201cStrip and kneel.\u201d</p><p>Her sweet compliance made him smile.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He really did like the submissive-masochists. And he intended to test her surrender, to push it a step further.</p><p>Her melting brown eyes showed both trepidation and need. It had been over two weeks since they\u2019d played, since he\u2019d hurt her. They\u2019d both enjoy tonight.</p><p>He bent and fastened well-padded leather wrist cuffs on her with panic snaps attached to the D-rings.</p><p>Her eyes went wide, and she started to shiver. Just the way he liked his subs. Pain was meat and potatoes, but anxiety added the dessert. \u201cUp, girl.\u201d</p><p>She rose, moving into position slowly. Odd how a masochist craved pain yet wanted to avoid it.</p><p>He clipped her wrist cuffs to a place on the chain that would keep her steady but not up on tiptoes. Not only because she didn\u2019t have a younger woman\u2019s supple joints, but also because he wanted her able to wiggle her ass this time. A Velcro strap around her ankles kept her legs together and limited other mobility. Her breathing had sped up, and he took a minute to stroke her smooth back. She had the prettiest dimples on each side of her low spine. Her legs were tanned, but her ass remained a seductive white that begged for stripes.</p><p>\u201cRelax, missy. This won\u2019t hurt much.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201c\u2018This won\u2019t hurt much\u2019 from a sadist is as believable as hearing a root canal is just a little uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He grinned and slapped her ass, leaving red handprints on the white canvas. And because he enjoyed the sound of his palm hitting skin and her sharp inhalations, he spanked her even longer. After a bit, her muscles loosened and her ass pushed back for each swat. His cock hardened, wanting to satisfy her unspoken request, but he\u2019d wait until she was breathing in the stinging like incense.</p><p>When her skin glowed a rosy red, he decided to up her arousal. Some masochists were a straight line\u2014pain alone. Some liked a base of pain and sex, and he loved to drive both sides of that triangle right to a peak at the top.</p><p>After pulling a stool over to her side, he donned a glove and lubed the fingers. With a hand on her belly to keep her still, he forced his slick his fingers between her ass cheeks.</p><p>\u201cNoooooo.\u201d Even her whining was beautifully musical.</p><p>Trying not to laugh, he pressed one finger against her anus, breached the rim of muscle, and slid in.</p><p>Her back arched in unspoken protest as she gasped.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just getting started, you know.\u201d He emphasized the statement by sliding his free hand up to give each breast a hard squeeze. Even as she hissed a protest, her ass cheeks clenched on his hand, making him grin. He added another finger. Damn, she was tight. His dick was uncomfortable inside his leather pants.</p><p>When he moved his hand from her breasts down to her pussy, she was as slick as any Dom could want. Still seated on the round stool, he pinned her legs between his knees. Watching her face, he set his thumb over her clit and thrust two fingers into her cunt. Her asshole clenched in response around his other fingers. Circling her clit, he alternated finger thrusts between her cunt and asshole until he heard her breathing change, until he felt her leg muscles tighten as she approached orgasm.</p><p>The perfect time to add in more pain.</p><p>When he slid his fingers out, she groaned in frustration.</p><p>After disposing of the glove, Sam took a kiss, playing with her nipples at the same time. When he lifted his head, her eyes were closed, her cheeks flushed. Beautiful Linda. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wrapping an arm around her waist, he bent and swatted her ass. Her body tensed\u2014no, she wasn\u2019t in subspace yet. The beast in him loved this point, when she still felt the pain a moment before the pleasure. She was almost to the shift, after which every blow would feel good.</p><p>As guttural Lesi\u00ebm chants came from the dungeon\u2019s speakers, Sam spanked her ass in time with the music. Undoubtedly, each swat vibrated that tender little asshole he\u2019d just stretched.</p><p>When a few people came into the dungeon to stand by the wall and watch, Linda noticed and flushed.</p><p>Sam grasped her chin, turning her head toward him. \u201cAttention on me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Her eyes focused on him. Only him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, girl.\u201d He ran his knuckles gently down her cheek. A submissive\u2019s need to please could often override any other instinct, and Linda was deeply submissive.</p><p>And ready for more. Her breasts were puckered nicely, her cheeks flushed, lips reddened. Damn, she was pretty.</p><p>He picked up the cane from his bag and started on her ass. Eventually, he\u2019d move around to her breasts for some fun.</p><p>SOMETIME LATER, AS Linda slid back into reality, her skin swam with lingering sensations. Her breasts ached with the most delicious burn from the light caning followed by the crop. As if in balance, her back, bottom, and upper thighs felt scalded with sublime pleasure.</p> <p>Everything had felt so good. Her head sagged against her upraised arm; her mind as hazy as if filled with fragrant smoke that made curling tendrils in the empty space.</p><p>Time had passed. Maybe a lot. She\u2019d gotten off twice and still wanted more. More pain, more touches. More, more, more. But Sam had said no\u2014said she\u2019d had enough. And now he flicked the crop up and down her back in mere touches of velvety pleasure rather than a conflagration. He was bringing her up slowly, barely cracking the window to reality. He was so careful of her.</p><p>And she loved him so much.</p><p>Her body throbbed, but now she could feel how the air was slightly cool against her legs. How her shoulders were starting to ache. The heavy sound of a flogger came from her right. People were talking somewhere in a low hum of conversation. She tried to raise her head and gave it up as a lost effort. Didn\u2019t seem to matter. Everything was so comfortable. Her blood sang through her veins with lovely little surges; air flowed in and out of her lungs. What a nicely working body.</p><p>\u201cLinda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm?\u201d</p> <p>Sam made that low snorty chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019re still off in space.\u201d</p><p>She started to close her eyes\u2014realized they\u2019d already closed\u2014and instead tipped her head, hoping he\u2019d make that growly sound\u2014the one that squeezed her spine, hand over hand, right down to her core.</p><p>Instead, she heard other voices from the observers. A tenor, a baritone, a woman\u2019s contralto. Then a higher tenor with an odd...scratchy sound.</p><p>Goose bumps broke out on her body as her chest tightened. That voice. Her hands fisted as the stench of the slave cages swept over her. Her own body stinking of urine and fear, women sobbing and screaming, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cGoddamn.\u201d Hard hands closed on her shoulders, a body pressed against her, and she cringed, shook her head, trying to get the fog to lift. \u201cNo. No.\u201d Her lips were numb, her words slurred.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d</p><p>The rough command swept through her, lifting the pressure on her chest so she could take a breath. Many, many breaths. The air was too heavy to fill her lungs.</p><p>\u201cEyes on me.\u201d Fingers gripped her chin, lifted her head.</p> <p>Eyes. Hers were scrunched shut. She forced them open and stared into the blazing blue fire of Sam\u2019s gaze. As her knees buckled, her weight dropped painfully onto her restrained arms. She jerked at them, needing to be free. Get away. Run.</p><p>\u201cEasy, girl.\u201d His powerful arm closed around her waist, holding her up. With his other hand, he used the quick release to free her left wrist, then the right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her ankles, Sam.\u201d A woman\u2019s voice. Worried.</p><p>Chills ran up Linda\u2019s spine, spreading to fill her until she shuddered. A blast of heat swept over her skin, followed by more ice. She couldn\u2019t stop shaking.</p><p>The world spun as Sam lifted her into his arms. \u201cLook at me, Linda. Just at me,\u201d he growled. Lights flickered to the sides as if she were in a car moving through a fog-filled landscape. Lost in a blurry world.</p><p>But his arms were around her, his chest solid against her side. A tremor shook her so horribly she moaned, and the fear-filled sound of her own voice shocked her.</p><p>Somewhere darker, quieter, he sat down.</p><p>He said something incomprehensible, yet the senseless growling smoothed the terrified knots in her head. Something wrapped around her. Warm. Fuzzy. Sam shifted, pulling it securely around her.</p><p>Naked. She\u2019d been naked. Now she wasn\u2019t. She blinked, expecting to see a ballroom filled with buyers and slaves. Her gaze focused on a pedestal planter filled with ferns. Another held begonias. The tiny blooms were like stars in the dark foliage. Life in the darkness. No one was screaming. The police had shouted and\u2014no, that wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t at the slave auction.</p><p>Men were talking. Her brows drew together as she tried to understand the words.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? She didn\u2019t seem anywhere close to a panic attack.\u201d A voice like the most expensive of dark chocolates. Familiar.</p><p>\u201cHit some trigger, but damned if I know what.\u201d The subterranean rumble through the chest under her ear. She could listen to him forever. \u201cNever had a sub panic at the end of a scene. She\u2019d been totally in subspace, and I was bringing her down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is odd. May I speak to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it. She\u2019s back with us.\u201d</p><p>She felt a brush of something on her hair. Sam was rubbing his chin on the top of her head in the most comforting of gestures, the one that said, I got you.</p><p>The other man\u2019s voice lowered. \u201cLinda, I feel you listening. Can you look at me?\u201d</p><p>Why did her eyes keep closing? Sam\u2019s arm was across her waist, his fingers holding her hip. She curled her fingers around his forearm\u2014stay here\u2014and forced her eyes open. Saw nothing except skin. Her face was pressed against his chest. Don\u2019t want to move. Don\u2019t want to see.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, baby. Head up.\u201d His voice was deeper. Rougher. She\u2019d worried him. Love him. Don\u2019t want to worry him.</p><p>She dug her fingernails into his skin so no one could snatch her away, then lifted her head. He held her tighter as if to reinforce she was safe. She turned her head.</p><p>Master Z was on one knee, both forearms on his thigh as he waited for her. \u201cThat\u2019s a good girl.\u201d His smile was faint, his gaze dark gray. Someone else she\u2019d worried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her throat felt as if it had rusted from years of disuse. \u201cIt\u2019s your coming-home celebration. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sam made a gruff sound of disbelief, but his arms didn\u2019t loosen.</p><p>As long as he held her, she didn\u2019t care how many noises he made. Her body was waking, starting to feel everything he\u2019d done. The burgeoning fear made her skin feel as if a scrub brush had scraped her raw.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more important.\u201d Z\u2019s voice was low, patient. He didn\u2019t move. She\u2019d lured a kitten from under her porch in just that way. Fuzzy, soft kitten. \u201cYou had a panic attack,\u201d Z said. \u201cCan you tell me what happened?\u201d</p><p>Did he think Sam had done something wrong? \u201cNot Sam. He didn\u2019t do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Samuel,\u201d he agreed. \u201cOr you wouldn\u2019t cling to him like that.\u201d His gaze dropped to where her fingers were clenched around Sam\u2019s arm.</p><p>She must be hurting him. She couldn\u2019t make her fingers loosen. A whimper slid out of her.</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d Sam\u2019s whisper ruffled her hair. \u201cHang on all you want, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see something that frightened you?\u201d Master Z asked.</p><p>\u201cMy eyes were closed,\u201d she said as Sam muttered, \u201cHer eyes were closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel something that brought back memories?\u201d</p><p>She pulled in a breath. Right before she\u2019d panicked, she\u2019d felt the tiny flickers of the crop, like a light touch after an orgasm, just enough to keep it going. He was good at giving pain. Giving orgasms too. The corners of her lips tilted up as she brought her attention back to Z.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feeling better.\u201d He was smiling slightly. \u201cSo not anything Sam did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you smell something?\u201d Sam\u2019s voice was as soft as a gravel truck could get.</p><p>Think, Linda. She tilted her head, remembering the feel of the whip, then the smells of the dungeon. A mineral scent along with the fragrance of leather and a hint of the cleanser. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat leaves sound,\u201d Z said. \u201cTell me what you heard, Linda.\u201d</p><p>The whip flicking. \u201cMusic. Gregorian chants. People talking. They were watching.\u201d She moved her shoulders. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t bother me.\u201d Nice voices. Talking. A tenor, a baritone, a woman\u2019s contralto. A higher tenor with an...odd scratchy sound. Her breath caught as if someone had stomped on her chest.</p><p>Sam\u2019s arms squeezed the last of the air from her. \u201cGot you, Linda. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes had scrunched closed again. I\u2019ve heard that tenor before. She forced her eyes open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Master Z held her gaze. \u201cTell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was here. Someone...someone from...\u201d She forced the word past her lips. \u201cA slaver. I know his laugh. His voice.\u201d</p><p>Sam growled under his breath.</p><p>Master Z\u2019s eyes turned almost black. \u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d</p> <p>Over and over, she tried to put a face with the voice. Nothing. She was disappointing Sam. Tears stung her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s arm moved, even with her holding it, as he tilted her face up to look at her. \u201cSorry for what, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know his face,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI never...\u201d</p><p>They stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cIn the cages. We were in cages for a while. And when people came, I kept my eyes closed. Trying to make them go away.\u201d Make everything all go away.</p> <p>\u201cClosed your eyes, huh?\u201d Sam huffed an actual laugh. \u201cBet you hid under the covers as a little girl like Nicole did.\u201d He wasn\u2019t mad. Wasn\u2019t blaming her. In fact, his hand slid from her chin to cup her cheek as he tucked her back against his chest.</p><p>She let out a sigh, feeling her body melt into him. Warm. Safe.</p><p>\u201cLinda,\u201d Z asked, \u201care you sure you heard someone from when you were imprisoned? Could the voice just be similar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Silence. She felt the owner of the Shadowlands study her and realized her eyes were shut again.</p><p>\u201cTalk later, Z,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI took her deep. She\u2019s going to drop hard.\u201d</p> <p>The rustle of clothes. She didn\u2019t want to open her eyes. Maybe the bad ones would all go away. Only they never had before. Closing her eyes hadn\u2019t worked. Hadn\u2019t saved her. Nothing had. She felt tears spill from her eyes to roll down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cLinda. Look at me.\u201d When she opened her eyes, Z was looking down at her with a gentle expression. \u201cSamuel and I are proud of you, little one. You did well.\u201d He squeezed her shoulder and left, his gait smooth and silent.</p><p>A knot loosened inside her but didn\u2019t halt the sadness, a thick ocean fog through the streets of her mind, covering her world in gray. Sad, sad gray. Is that where Holly is? Buried in gray?</p><p>A sob made her breathing stumble. Then another.</p><p>Sam rumbled something, and after a second she realized what he\u2019d said. \u201cCry, girl. I won\u2019t let go. Cry.\u201d</p><p>Burying her head in his shoulder, she did.</p><p>To see the redheaded ex-slave have a panic attack had been quite diverting. As the spotter strolled toward the unattached submissives\u2019 area, he smiled.</p><p>Even more satisfying was seeing the Dom\u2019s scene crash and burn. Such a pity, Master Sam. The asshole. Although Davies could wield a whip well, he always stopped too soon. Didn\u2019t break the submissives, didn\u2019t force them to grovel. And afterward, he treated the sluts like pampered babies.</p> <p>Disgusting. Aaron\u2019s jaw clenched. Stupid slaves would kneel and beg Davies for a flogging. Some of them were ones who\u2019d turned Aaron down when he\u2019d invited them to play. I\u2019m far more of a Master than he\u2019ll ever be. I\u2019ve fucked more women, hurt more women.</p><p>Killed more women.</p><p>He smoothed his hair down as satisfaction filled him. Yes, he\u2019d had a fine time recently. He\u2019d been smart to continue using prostitutes. They were sleazy, but...nicely simple. Flash some money, pick one up, deal with her how he pleased. Leave the body in a ditch and take his money back. Yes, he had to be cautious about leaving evidence, but at least he had no Harvest Association Overseer to placate over damaged\u2014or dead\u2014merchandise.</p><p>And for a pleasant treat between kills, he used the Shadowlands.</p><p>As he neared the bar, he noticed the side door was ajar. Z must have opened the Capture Gardens. Now that promised to be fun. Perhaps a bit risky, since Z and the Masters kept a close eye on the proceedings. But there were ways around that.</p><p>As he approached the unattached submissives, he surveyed the offerings. Two of them he\u2019d played with before. No. Not in a mood to exert himself unduly, he also rejected the most athletic-looking women. He\u2019d save his energy for roughing up his prey. And fucking her. Up the ass would suit his mood tonight.</p><p>A tattooed one caught his eye. Nice. But then he saw the trainee cuffs on her wrists. Not a good choice. Z kept a close eye on the trainees. All the Masters did.</p><p>Ah, perhaps that brunette. She couldn\u2019t be more than midtwenties. He preferred older slaves, but for what he had in mind in the Gardens, an inexperienced submissive would be best. He stalked into the sitting area, gave them all an impersonal, cold stare, and watched them react to his dominance. \u201cI\u2019m looking for some sport in the Capture Gardens,\u201d he said.</p><p>Three of the submissives, including his choice, showed interest. He held his hand out to her. \u201cWould you care to play the game?\u201d</p><p>She jumped to her feet. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Noticing a slut he\u2019d used before shaking her head no toward the girl, he smoothly moved the girl away. \u201cDo you have a safe word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI use red.\u201d The girl tried to look confident.</p><p>He almost laughed. \u201cRed will be fine.\u201d Wasn\u2019t it a shame she wouldn\u2019t be able to yell with his hand over her mouth? And he could tell that when he broke the insecure sub down and scared her enough, she wouldn\u2019t return to the Shadowlands. Wouldn\u2019t tell a soul.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Sam scowled as he watched Linda drive down his farm lane toward the front gate. Goddamned stubborn woman. She sure as hell hadn\u2019t slept long enough but still dragged herself out of bed to sing in a church service. Wouldn\u2019t even wait for him to get the gate for her.</p><p>His mood lightened as he remembered how she\u2019d snarled at him. Her grumpy morning face was damn cute.</p><p>And he\u2019d see her later. Z had called already this morning. He\u2019d arranged a late-afternoon meeting today with her, the Feds, and the other Masters. Just what she needed. More stress in her life. At least, she\u2019d agreed to let him pick her up at her home after work and drive her to the Shadowlands for the meeting.</p><p>With a snap of his fingers for Conn, he headed down the drive. Since the construction crew took Sundays off, he\u2019d lock the gate before heading to the orchards.</p><p>Halfway down the lane, Conn let out an \u201cincoming\u201d bark as a car turned in. The vehicle was an ancient two-door with dings and dents all over the bumper. One headlight gone. Blonde at the wheel. Hell. Even before he saw her face, he knew, and his gut felt as if he\u2019d swallowed glass.</p><p>Without thinking\u2014just to keep her from his house\u2014he stepped into the center of the drive, forcing her to stop if she didn\u2019t want to run him over. Muscles tense, he prepared to jump out of the way if she was too drugged out to notice an obstacle.</p><p>She stopped.</p><p>His fury grew, and he yanked open her door. Conn growled.</p><p>She gave him a beseeching look. \u201cSam. Darling. I know you didn\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the hell off my land.\u201d She wasn\u2019t high but strung out instead. Face sweaty. Hands shaking. His jaw tightened. No matter how often he\u2019d seen her like this, it still grated. No one\u2014ex-wife or not\u2014should do that to herself.</p><p>He smothered the maddening need to fix her. Year after year, he\u2019d tried that. Programs, clinics, therapy, detoxing wards. The minute she was released, she\u2019d return to shooting poison into her veins.</p><p>\u201cI need a little help, darling. To buy food.\u201d</p><p>Right. Any cash would go straight into a smack buy. \u201cBeen through this, Nancy. No money. You aren\u2019t gone when I reach the house, I call the cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucking bastard.\u201d Her mask of niceness slipped, and mean replaced it. \u201cI put up with you for years, gave you a child. You can\u2019t even spare me a few bucks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get money from the trustee every month. You get no more.\u201d Their divorce had been ugly, but the evidence of her drug use and toxic behavior had disgusted the judge. She hadn\u2019t been awarded alimony. Nonetheless, she was Nicole\u2019s mother. He\u2019d hired a trustee to pay for a room and groceries, and to deal with her. Because he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Seeing her\u2014each and every time\u2014left him frozen inside. It would take a few days before he even wanted to see people again.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d she hissed like the viper she\u2019d turned out to be. \u201cI loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when you wanted something from me.\u201d His mouth twisted at the foul taste.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Sam. Darling, I owe Stevie a thousand dollars. Can you give it to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Sam. Oh, darling, I broke my laptop. Will you buy me a new one?\u201d</p><p>Broken, hell. She\u2019d hocked that laptop for drug money. Although he\u2019d canceled her credit cards and stopped handing her cash, he\u2019d been slow to realize she was selling things off. She\u2019d even pawned some of Nicole\u2019s toys. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know love if it bit you in the ass.\u201d As ice wrapped around him, he welcomed the way it blunted his rage. His memories.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll go to Nicole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bother Nicole, I cut off your monthly money, and you get nothing. Get out of here.\u201d He slammed her door shut and stepped away.</p><p>Two minutes later, as her car squealed down the road, he locked the gate and flipped on the security alarm. After the second time she\u2019d broken into the house, he\u2019d shelled out for the fancy-ass system. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a minute, many minutes, he stood, unable to move. Her car was no longer in sight, but her presence lingered like a rotting carcass, casting a stench over the farm.</p><p>Leaning on the gate, he felt as hollowed out as if she\u2019d gutted him. His energy, his emotions were drained. Turning, he looked up toward the farm buildings. The sky showed clouds rolling in. The temperature was probably dropping, although he was already cold to the bone.</p><p>Got chores to do. He couldn\u2019t seem to move.</p><p>With a whine, Conn pawed at Sam\u2019s boot.</p> <p>Sam shook his head, knowing he should reassure the dog. Couldn\u2019t. Moving slowly, he started the long walk up the drive.</p><p>As the wintery sunlight came through the windshield of Sam\u2019s truck, he drove toward the Shadowlands. Linda sat quietly in the passenger seat.</p><p>Hours after Nancy\u2019s visit, he still felt...off. Cold, inside and out. Like parts of him had been ripped away, leaving a husk behind.</p><p>After a few attempts to talk that had fallen flat, Linda had remained silent. He glanced over at her.</p><p>She was watching him. \u201cAre you okay, Sam?\u201d</p> <p>Why the hell did she ask him that? \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d Her brows drew together. \u201cIs it because of last night? Because our scene went from wonderful to horrible?\u201d</p><p>His gut twisted. He was a Dom. If anything went wrong in a scene, it was his fault. For a second, he thought about explaining, but the blackness roiling through his head eroded the words into dust. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Her huff wasn\u2019t a happy one. \u201cI wish you\u2019d tell me what\u2019s wrong. Can\u2019t you talk to me?\u201d</p><p>Talk? From a distance, the windows of Z\u2019s manor glinted. \u201cNothing to say.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers pleated the bottom of her shirt. \u201cYou let me cry, get me to dump all over you, but won\u2019t share what\u2019s bothering you.\u201d She gave him an unhappy look. \u201cContrary to popular belief, a Dom isn\u2019t a bulletproof superman. I want to help when you feel bad, Sam.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo need.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back as if he\u2019d slapped her.</p><p>He should apologize. Take her hand. But ropes had been wrapped around his soul. His hands tightened on the steering wheel, and he turned into the drive to the Shadowlands. Beneath the tall palms that lined the road, the flower beds seemed garishly bright in the gray light.</p><p>As Linda walked beside Sam through the side gate in the privacy fence, she tried to ignore the ache in her chest.</p><p>Although he was hurting, apparently she wasn\u2019t someone he felt he could lean on or share with.</p><p>Last night, she\u2019d been so happy to see him. Her heart had actually lifted, bounced, danced. And he\u2019d comforted her so sweetly after that horrible scene.</p><p>Today he was terrifyingly distant. The lines bracketing his mouth were deeper, his eyes a colder blue. He was suffering, and she wanted to help. A shiver ran through her as her stupid insecurities flared up. He didn\u2019t need her. Didn\u2019t need anything from her.</p><p>Without speaking, he held the side gate open for her, and they crossed the yard to the back lanai. The decorations from the wedding were gone, but the landscaping was still stunningly beautiful. People were scattered in chairs and couches in the screen-covered outdoor room. After a second, Linda recognized the two Mistresses, Olivia and Anne, whom Rainie had pointed out during the wedding ceremony. All of the Shadowlands Masters\u2014Dan, Nolan, Cullen, Marcus, and Raoul\u2014were present. Z sat at a long iron-and-oak table beside Vance and Galen. The two FBI agents headed the task force concentrating on the Harvest Association.</p> <p>In jeans and a pink scoop-neck T-shirt, Jessica was serving soft drinks to the guests. Her \u201ccollar\u201d sparkled in the sunlight almost as much as she did. She saw them and set the drinks down. \u201cLinda!\u201d</p><p>Pushing her worries back, Linda abandoned Sam to receive an enthusiastic hug from the short blonde. \u201cWelcome home. Did you have a good honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome. Mostly.\u201d After a glance over her shoulder at Master Z, her voice dropped. \u201cWhen we got to the chalet, I gave him the toys I bought from Rainie. A present, right? But the bastard used them all that night. Every. Single. One.\u201d</p><p>Remembering the number of items Jessica had purchased, Linda bit the inside of her cheek to keep from laughing.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jessica narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou know how some Doms don\u2019t let you get off until they say? It\u2019s much, much worse when they won\u2019t let you stop. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>Like what Sam had done to her after the bachelorette party? \u201cI know exactly what you mean, and all I can say is that I\u2019m really happy I didn\u2019t buy half the things you did.\u201d</p><p>Jessica busted out laughing so hard that everyone looked at them. \u201cDamn Doms.\u201d</p><p>Linda\u2019s spirits lifted. How lovely to hear laughter.</p><p>Smiling, Z shook his head and said to Marcus, \u201cI thought two weeks away from your little brat would be good for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like it,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your work cut out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Z said.</p><p>\u201cWork? He calls me work?\u201d Jessica said under her breath. She glared at Nolan. Then her eyes sliced to Linda, and she whispered, \u201cThat Dom needs a lesson. Let\u2019s work on corrupting Beth.\u201d</p><p>Linda choked on a laugh.</p><p>Z raised his voice. \u201cI asked Galen and Vance to give us a rundown on what\u2019s happening. Then perhaps Linda can talk with us.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d want her to talk about that voice. About the slavers. Of course, she\u2019d known the plan. Sickness rose in her belly.</p><p>Even as Z stood, concern on his face, Jessica tugged her to a chair. \u201cSit before you fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d A shadow fell across her face. She looked up. Sam had taken a position next to her, arms crossed over his chest. The tightness under her breastbone eased slightly, then came back as she realized he wasn\u2019t even looking at her. He stood there with a remote expression as if he were watching a boring television show. Not involved at all. Why? Why, Sam? Unable to help herself, she put her hand on his hip.</p><p>He shifted away.</p><p>She looked down, blinking hard. After a minute, she realized Jessica had sat beside her. Had taken her hand.</p><p>After squeezing Jessica\u2019s hand in gratitude, Linda concentrated on the discussion.</p><p>Galen had been talking, his intensity a distinct contrast to his more laid-back partner. But both held the unmistakable aura of authority.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve eliminated the Harvest Association in three of the four quadrants,\u201d Galen said. \u201cThe last one is the most entrenched and will be the most difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinda, I wanted to update you.\u201d Vance\u2019s blue eyes met hers. \u201cThe murderer you helped convict lasted three days in the penitentiary, then was shivved during a prison yard fight. He didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, unable to process the information.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Marcus sighed. \u201cI do believe that sounds like a fitting end. May God have mercy on his soul.\u201d</p><p>Someday, someday she hoped she\u2019d feel the same. Maybe then, she\u2019d know she was healed. She pulled in a slow breath. Be at peace, Holly. He won\u2019t hurt anyone else.</p><p>Vance continued, enumerating other convictions. Then he glanced at Raoul. \u201cA while back, we recovered a slave from Greville\u2019s estate.\u201d</p><p>Greville. Linda\u2019s mouth compressed. He\u2019d been Kim\u2019s owner and had stabbed her. Almost killed her.</p><p>Raoul straightened. \u201cGreville bought a slave after Kim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. I don\u2019t know if you want to share this with Kim, but the girl was totally closed up. Not talking. Almost catatonic.\u201d Galen\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cShe came out of it soon after I told her Greville was dead, that another slave had killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you for the news,\u201d Raoul said. \u201cMi gatita might find it helps the guilt she carries for his death.\u201d</p><p>Poor Kim. But thinking of the lives the slavers had ruined, Linda couldn\u2019t keep from shuddering. Unable to help herself, she glanced over at Sam. He was watching her, but he didn\u2019t move closer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still trying to locate all the missing women,\u201d Vance said. \u201cNot many of the slavers are willing to cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose fucktards,\u201d Anne growled. \u201cLet me have a turn with them, and they\u2019ll beg to tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>As laughter broke out, Linda glanced inquisitively at Jessica.</p><p>Jessica leaned over and whispered, \u201cRemember, she\u2019s a sadist.\u201d Her eyebrows waggled. \u201cAnd she loves cock-and-ball torture.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Ow. But wouldn\u2019t that be a wonderful kind of justice?</p><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019re caught up, let\u2019s talk about the spotter in the Shadowlands,\u201d Vance said.</p><p>Was he talking about the person whose voice she\u2019d heard? \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince the association targets women in the lifestyle, BDSM clubs are prime hunting grounds,\u201d Galen said. \u201cThe spotter chooses which women should be kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>Linda shivered.</p><p>\u201cYou arrested the Overseer,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cHe worked with the spotter. Can\u2019t he identify him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know the spotter\u2019s name, just had an e-mail address and phone number.\u201d Vance\u2019s jaw hardened. \u201cThe description the Overseer gave us fits half the men in the club, and since he\u2019s blind, he can\u2019t ID the bastard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou picked up a lot of the association personnel. None of them can help?\u201d Cullen asked.</p><p>\u201cThe association hires a different person for each part of a kidnapping,\u201d Galen said. \u201cA spotter to pick the women, an investigator to choose the most vulnerable, one for the kidnapping, others to \u2018warehouse\u2019 the victims until the auction. One person in that chain knows very little about the others.\u201d</p><p>Vance nodded at Sam and Raoul. \u201cWithout you two, this quadrant would still be in operation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the bastard who targeted Shadowlands submissives remains.\u201d Z\u2019s voice was low, but the fury was plain.</p> <p>\u201cSurprising you couldn\u2019t pick him out, psychologist-mind reader that you are,\u201d Cullen said.</p><p>Linda thought Cullen was joking, but no one laughed.</p><p>\u201cI wondered that myself,\u201d Z said. \u201cBut a Dom considering a submissive for a scene has the same emotions as the spotter\u2014lust and acquisitiveness. I doubt there\u2019s any guilt present.\u201d</p><p>Galen took a sip of his drink. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Human traffickers feel women are meant to be slaves.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Linda thought. The slavers had made her feel as if she were nothing. She unclenched her hands. Stay focused. \u201cSo last night I probably heard the man who targeted Gabi and Jessica for kidnapping?\u201d</p> <p>No wonder Z was so furious.</p><p>\u201cThe rat bastard,\u201d Jessica muttered. \u201cIf I find him, I\u2019ll help Anne crush his widdle dick.\u201d</p><p>Linda snickered.</p><p>\u201cYou find something funny about this?\u201d Nolan growled in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u201d\u2014Linda swallowed down more laughter\u2014\u201cif he picked Jessica and Gabi for a rebellious slave auction, he\u2019s got a really good eye.\u201d</p><p>After a second, Jessica burst into giggles. No one else even smiled.</p> <p>Galen stared at the two of them, laughing like fools, before commenting to Z, \u201cWomen really are the tougher sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Z picked up Jessica and sat down with her in his lap. \u201cSilence, pet. Let\u2019s keep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZ said you\u2019d heard the man during your captivity. Do you remember when?\u201d Vance asked Linda.</p><p>Her amusement disappeared, and she tried to steady her breathing. \u201cIt would have to be before the first auction. On the boat. I-I had my eyes closed. Didn\u2019t look at anything.\u201d</p><p>Galen tilted his head. \u201cWhy only then?\u201d</p><p>The temperature in the garden seemed to drop, and she wrapped her arms around herself, wishing Sam would hold her the way Z was holding Jessica. But today...today he wasn\u2019t the man she knew. \u201cThey stored us belowdecks in k-kennels.\u201d</p><p>Galen nodded. \u201cWe impounded a boat like that.\u201d His level gaze met hers, silently saying, It can\u2019t hurt you now.</p><p>The tightness around her chest loosened a little. \u201cOn the boat, select buyers came to look at us. I-I felt like an animal. In a cage. Being stared at. I\u2019d curl up on the floor and close my eyes.\u201d She pulled in a breath. \u201cThe man I heard in the Shadowlands was in a group arguing the merits of older or younger slaves.\u201d</p> <p>Vance frowned. \u201cZ said you were sure that was the man, so he must have a pretty distinctive voice. Can you describe it?\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to listen to the memory. Her nausea increased. \u201cTenor. Thin and slightly metallic.\u201d</p><p>Everyone stared at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Marcus smiled. \u201cThat won\u2019t help to find him, darlin\u2019. Tell us, how is his voice different from a normal one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no normal voices. Everybody is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they now?\u201d Galen gave her an odd look. \u201cIf we blindfolded you, would you be able to tell our voices apart.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, feeling like a freak.</p><p>\u201cAn auditory person,\u201d Z murmured. \u201cDo you sing?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>\u201cDropped out getting her BA in music,\u201d Sam said. \u201cSings in a choir\u2014was director for a while. Has a piano and a guitar.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. He might be staring out at the gardens, but apparently he was listening. Her feeling of loss lightened slightly. \u201cMy son tries to fake me out on the phone by assuming different voices. He never wins.\u201d She stopped, searching for a word that didn\u2019t exist. \u201cThe resonance? Timbre? The pattern is the same whether baritone or soprano.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the attendance records from last night, but almost the entire membership was there,\u201d Z said grimly.</p><p>\u201cLine up all the members and Linda listens to them?\u201d Olivia suggested.</p><p>\u201cGetting them there at one time would be difficult, even without the members who were present from out of the area,\u201d Z said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, contact information isn\u2019t always current.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the spotter caught a whisper of a lineup, he\u2019d disappear.\u201d Galen turned to Linda. \u201cCan you spend time at the Shadowlands? Just to listen?\u201d Galen asked. \u201cThen if you can\u2019t pick him out that way, we\u2019ll try rounding them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... Yes. I can.\u201d The thought made her feel sick.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sam growled, speaking for the first time. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cThat\u2019s not your choice.\u201d Memories swamped her. Sickened her. \u201cI decide when you piss. When you eat. Who you fuck.\u201d The Overseer\u2019s hand lashing across her face, the pain as he slapped her over and over. \u201cDon\u2019t think, slut. Just obey.\u201d She swallowed against rising bile and tried to straighten her shoulders. She was free. No one could order her around. Never again.</p><p>Galen frowned at Sam and then gave her an intense look. \u201cIt could be dangerous. Despite the arrests of his companions, the spotter is bold enough\u2014and needy enough\u2014to return to the Shadowlands. He\u2019d react badly to the threat of exposure.\u201d</p><p>Vance nodded. \u201cThe club won\u2019t be open until next Friday. You think this over.\u201d</p><p>A chill of fear raised the hairs on Linda\u2019s nape. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d had enough. Although none of the rest appeared ready to leave, she turned to Sam. \u201cCan you take me home?\u201d</p><p>Sam pulled up in front of Linda\u2019s house after a trip as silent as the one to the Shadowlands. He needed to talk to her, to convince her to stay away from the Shadowlands.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the ride.\u201d Linda slid out of the truck and closed the door.</p><p>Hell. Watching her walk up the sidewalk, he spotted white blotches on the house. More paint had been scrubbed away. The spray painter had hit again. Anger lit a low burn in his gut.</p><p>He got out of the truck. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>She came back down the sidewalk. \u201cYes?\u201d Her voice was tight. The afternoon had been hard on her.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been any help. Guilt and worry started to erode the ice inside him. \u201cGot your paint. King\u2019s antigraffiti stuff. I stopped by the paint store, and they matched your blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her eyes brightened. \u201cNo more coming home to nasty words? Best news all day.\u201d She grabbed him around the waist and hugged him hard. \u201cGod, I love you, Sam.\u201d</p><p>He froze.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Sam. Can I have some money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you loved me, you\u2019d give me money.\u201d</p><p>He had no control over the way his body turned stiff or how he pulled away.</p><p>Her big brown eyes searched his face as she drew in a breath. \u201cMaybe I rushed my fences, but Sam, I know you feel something for me even if you don\u2019t say the words.\u201d</p><p>He fought against the thickness in his throat. The ice in his gut.</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d Her voice came out pleading. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong. Is it something I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen. I-I need to know.\u201d She bit her lip, blinking hard. \u201cI thought... Is that what today was\u2014you pulling away?\u201d</p><p>She looked vulnerable. Hurt. \u201cLinda, I\u2014\u201d His lips were stiff. He knew his face must be cold.</p><p>\u201cThey looked at me like that,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He never wanted her to feel like that. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Regret darkened her eyes, and she backed up.</p><p>Pain filled him as he realized she\u2019d taken his words for a good-bye rather than an apology.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you,\u201d she whispered. She turned and\u2014not running, no, not Linda\u2014walked steadily into her house and closed the door.</p><p>Feeling as stunned as after his first mortar-shelling barrage in \u2019Nam, Sam drove through the tiny beach town. His jaw was clenched so hard his teeth made a grinding sound. What had he done?</p><p>A black animal ran right in front of his truck, and Sam stomped on the brakes. With a shriek, the truck skidded to a halt, rocking back and forth. The stench of burned rubber wafted through the open window as the scrawny mutt skittered under a hole in a fence.</p><p>He\u2019d almost killed a dog with his goddamned inattention. As stupid as driving drunk.</p><p>After parking at the curb, he headed toward the beach a few blocks away. A yellow-haired boy ran past him, chased by a smaller girl.</p><p>When a woman pulling weeds looked up and stiffened, Sam knew he must look bad. He\u2019d visited Michigan once in the winter. Froze his face so bad that his lips didn\u2019t want to move. Felt like that now.</p><p>Felt like that with Linda. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the edge of the beach, Sam put a foot up on the low railing, leaned on his knee, and watched the rough waves splash against the sand. Dark clouds had covered the sky, and the palms lining the sidewalk bowed against the bitter wind. The whole damn world felt cold.</p><p>Over and over today, Linda had needed him, and he\u2019d stood silent. Unmoving.</p><p>And now... \u201cGod, I love you, Sam.\u201d He scrubbed his face as if he could erase the memory of the hurt in her eyes when he hadn\u2019t spoken. Years of being a Dom meant he could see when his words\u2014or lack of them\u2014did damage.</p><p>He\u2019d known. But couldn\u2019t reach out. Couldn\u2019t speak. She\u2019d been damned brave today, and he hadn\u2019t told her that. Hadn\u2019t told her how proud he was of her.</p> <p>What kind of a bastard got involved with a woman and didn\u2019t help her when she needed him? Got so twisted into knots that he couldn\u2019t even tell her how he felt? Or take her hand when she looked lost?</p><p>He straightened, looking up into the ugly sky as the first drops of rain hit. Linda deserved someone who\u2019d be there for her.</p><p>That someone wasn\u2019t him. He rubbed the tight spot in his chest, then headed back to his truck.</p><p>As he climbed in his truck, he remembered the paint cans in the back and the white blotches on her house. He\u2019d taken that task on himself, and it wasn\u2019t finished. Once that was done...</p><p>Linda hadn\u2019t been able to cry or eat or even think. Her emotions felt battered, as if someone had taken a baseball bat to them. The television had bothered her. She\u2019d turned it off. She\u2019d tried reading and then stared at one page for half an hour. The basket she started was a misshapen disaster. Finally she went to bed and stared at the ceiling.</p> <p>She\u2019d think tomorrow. Me and Scarlett O\u2019Hara\u2014we know how to handle life. You bet.</p><p>A man shouted.</p><p>Linda jolted upright in bed, realizing she must have finally drifted off. The red display on her clock said four a.m., and her room was dark. Quiet. Unlike all the noise outside. What in the world?</p><p>\u201cFucking son of a bitch, let me go!\u201d The man\u2019s voice was high-pitched but familiar.</p><p>The low growl in response was instantaneously recognizable. Sam.</p><p>Linda yanked on her robe. Her heart was pounding crazily. Really, this wasn\u2019t a good way for an ex-slave to wake up. I need a dog.</p> <p>She pulled Frederick\u2019s ancient golf club from under the bed and ran into the living room.</p><p>A hammering on the door burst like a bomb into the quiet house.</p><p>With a tight grip on her weapon, Linda cracked the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Sam stood on her doorstep. She started to smile, then saw the man sprawled at his feet, squirming like a worm. His wrists were restrained behind his back with handcuffs.</p><p>When he tried to sit up, Sam flattened him with a boot on his back. \u201cAnnoy me, asshole, and I\u2019ll break your spine just to enjoy the crunch.\u201d He glanced at Linda, eyes colder than she\u2019d ever seen. \u201cFeels like cracking ice cubes with your teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d She swallowed, remembering the sound from something much, much more horrible.</p><p>Sam\u2019s gaze softened. \u201cSorry, girl.\u201d He thumped the man with his boot, getting a pained oomph. \u201cThis is your graffiti artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d When the man looked up at her, her jaw dropped. \u201cDwayne?\u201d Dwayne had been painting filth on her house?</p> <p>\u201cKnow him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She took in his nod. \u201cYou\u2019re not surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo persistent. Too nasty. Doubted he was a stranger.\u201d</p><p>Dwayne glared at her. \u201cLet me go, or I\u2019ll sue the fucking crap out of you. I was just walking by when this...\u201d</p><p>Sam put weight on the man\u2019s back, and Dwayne squeaked. \u201cIdiot,\u201d Sam muttered. \u201cNo gloves. Your prints will be all over the cans out there.\u201d</p><p>Dwayne\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Dwayne?\u201d Linda tightened her belt against the chill night. The rain had swept through, leaving the air fresh except for the scent of paint. \u201cWhat did I do that you\u2019d hate me this much?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Sweat broke out on the reporter\u2019s brow as he continued to struggle.</p><p>\u201cTalk to her, boy.\u201d Sam dropped his voice into a Dom\u2019s low threat. \u201cOr you\u2019ll scream for me.\u201d</p><p>Dwayne stared up at Sam like a mouse confronting a hawk. After a minute, he managed to pull his gaze away and say to Linda, \u201cWhy? We fucked, and it was good, but then you dump me and go to a sleazy club. You\u2019re a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch the language, boy.\u201d When Sam fisted his hair and yanked, Dwayne shrieked like a girl. His cheek was mashed into the step, one brown eye staring up at her.</p><p>\u201cYou wrote filth on my house because I didn\u2019t want to date you?\u201d That didn\u2019t make sense. Dwayne wasn\u2019t that energetic, which was why he worked for the small Foggy Shores newspaper...although he was always talking about getting his big break by writing a prizewinning article.</p><p>Oh heavens, that was it. Fury flamed inside her. \u201cYou just wanted more stories for the paper. The graffiti kept the gossip alive.\u201d She heard something outside but couldn\u2019t get past her anger.</p><p>\u201cLike anyone would believe you,\u201d Dwayne muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re a slut. A nothing in this town. And everybody knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou painted that crap on her house to get a goddamned story?\u201d Sam\u2019s voice rose.</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah. Sex slaves? Everybody reads that shit.\u201d Dwayne smirked. \u201cA shame you can\u2019t prove fuck all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that admission will work in court,\u201d a man said.</p><p>Linda\u2019s head jerked up. Officer Joe Blount stood just outside the circle of light. Another uniformed policeman was hurrying up the sidewalk.</p><p>Sam nodded to the men. \u201cCaught him spray-painting her house. Paint cans are there. Probably have his fingerprints. You can match his shoes to the tracks in the mud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWard, see to collecting evidence, would you?\u201d Officer Blount glanced at Sam. \u201cI\u2019d like you to come down to the station to make a report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Sam jerked his chin toward Linda. \u201cShe just woke up when I pounded on her door.\u201d</p><p>Joe gave her a sympathetic smile. The gray-haired cop had taken her complaints before. \u201cYou\u2019ll press charges, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she said firmly, ignoring Dwayne\u2019s incoherent protest.</p><p>\u201cThen stop by in the morning. No need for us all to lose sleep.\u201d</p><p>Finally realizing his life was spinning down the drain, Dwayne started struggling again. \u201cHey, I want a lawyer. I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll in good time.\u201d Joe bent and traced a finger over the smooth silver curves of the handcuffs on Dwayne. He glanced up at Sam. \u201cNice cuffs you got there, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Sam silently handed him the key.</p><p>After switching the cuffs, Joe pulled a paper from his pocket and read from it. \u201cYou have the right...\u201d</p><p>Linda turned toward Sam. He\u2019d been guarding her. He did care for her. \u201cThank you.\u201d She took a step toward him. \u201cSam...\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and stepped away from her. \u201cNo. You\u2019re better off without me.\u201d His eyes were pale ice, his face cold. \u201cHave a good life, Linda.\u201d He strode down the sidewalk.</p><p>Taking her heart with him.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>I don\u2019t need him. I don\u2019t. Linda bent her head and fingerpicked a melody in minor, the sound plaintive in the early dawn. Earlier she\u2019d tried to play lighthearted songs, but her guitar wanted to mourn.</p><p>The scent of the freesias drifted through the air, reminding her of Jessica and Z\u2019s wedding. They were so happy together. She\u2019d bet that Z talked to Jessica, shared his feelings. His past.</p><p>Sam hadn\u2019t. But why?</p><p>Maybe because she wasn\u2019t important enough in his life.</p><p>Why did she keep stewing over it? Linda shook her head. She didn\u2019t know what had happened, what she\u2019d done wrong, but he wasn\u2019t a man who said what he didn\u2019t mean. Their relationship\u2014if that\u2019s what it had been\u2014was over. He\u2019d said so.</p><p>She frowned. She\u2019d just watched him walk away from her.</p><p>At one time, she might have argued with him, but the cold look in his eyes had paralyzed her. It had been too close to how the slavers had looked at her. And after being treated like an animal, a nothing that didn\u2019t deserve answers, she hadn\u2019t been able to say...anything. Her fingers clenched, turning the C-minor chord into ugliness. She flattened her hand over the strings, muting the sound.</p><p>That was what the human traffickers had done to her. Muted her as if her voice shouldn\u2019t be heard in the world.</p><p>But they hadn\u2019t succeeded. No, she was here in her own home, outside in the sweet air, seeing the stars disappearing in the dawn sky.</p><p>Nonetheless they\u2019d changed her, made her more vulnerable. Her breathing hitched for a moment as she remembered Sam\u2019s tough, weathered face, his strong hands, his heavy-lidded eyes when he planned to take her. Such a stern man, yet his eyes would unexpectedly light with amusement.</p><p>For a moment she wanted him with everything inside her.</p><p>She shook her head and changed to a new song. If her guitar wanted to mourn, then she should allow it. Over the years, she\u2019d learned that her guitar always spoke truth\u2014the truth in her heart. Her fingers slid into Joan Baez\u2019s sad \u201cDiamonds and Rust.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, Sam, I did love you...oh so dearly,\u201d she whispered.

The first tear dropped onto the slick face of her guitar with a tapping sound. Another followed.</p><p>When Linda walked into the coffee shop, the three customers in the room went silent. Their attention on her felt like sandpaper against raw skin. SueAnn, a woman from church who always acted as if Linda had cooties, sat with Patsy, a clerk from two shops down, and a stylish middle-aged woman.</p><p>Linda\u2019s body stiffened as if chilled in the freezer. Patsy was just a gossip, but SueAnn could be hateful. Ignoring them, she gave Betty her order, glanced at the pastries, then shrugged. No appetite today. Again. Heck of a way to diet.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you doing, Linda?\u201d SueAnn asked, her voice even sweeter than her overly sugared desserts at potlucks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Her lips felt stiff as if reluctant to form the words. Hadn\u2019t Sam said just that to her? \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Hadn\u2019t his face looked as frozen as hers was now as he spoke the same lie? \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good, good. But didn\u2019t I hear that you and Lee broke up?\u201d SueAnn\u2019s face was alight with vindictive interest, and Linda remembered Lee had said SueAnn made a pass at him. \u201cDoes your new boyfriend like all the...special things...you learned when you were...away?\u201d</p><p>I am not in the mood for this. Linda planted her feet. As she\u2019d come to acceptance with herself, she realized almost everyone in town had been supportive. There\u2019d only been a few\u2014like Dwayne\u2014who behaved like gossipy, spiteful teenage girls. She\u2019d tried to ignore them; obviously that wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>She wished she could flatten the woman the way Sam had stomped on Dwayne. But no. Besides, SueAnn\u2019s weapons were words. So be it. Linda gave the woman a toothy smile. \u201cOh, most men like variety.\u201d Her voice came out even and pleasant. \u201cBless your heart, SueAnn. Maybe if you\u2019d expanded your repertoire to something besides the missionary position, your ex wouldn\u2019t have tried to fuck every female in town.\u201d</p> <p>As SueAnn went bug-eyed, Linda moved to the end of the counter, hoping her coffee was ready. But Betty had disappeared, and whoops of laughter came from the back room. Linda bit the inside of her cheek, half-appalled at what she\u2019d said. Mostly okay with it.</p><p>She heard chairs scrape and the door open as SueAnn and crew fled from the battlefield. What a shame. Linda glanced over her shoulder and blinked.</p><p>The stylish woman remained at the table. \u201cI\u2019m Meredith Blake, the new owner of the swimsuit store.\u201d She rose and shook hands with Linda. \u201cThat was the prettiest smackdown I\u2019ve seen since I left Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it though?\u201d Flushed with laughter, Betty stood in the door of the back room. \u201cGood to see you getting back to normal.\u201d</p><p>Linda\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re a polite woman, never said you weren\u2019t. The look in your eye told people not to push you. But you\u2019ve been slinking around here since you returned.\u201d Betty\u2019s grin widened as she handed Linda her coffee. \u201cOn the house. Welcome home, child.\u201d</p> <p>A few minutes later, Linda settled onto her favorite beachside picnic table and toed off her high heels. It was a cheerful day with a bright sun and a breeze strong enough to fling tiny grains of sand at Linda\u2019s ankles and bare feet.</p><p>Along the boardwalk, tourists were window-shopping. Down on the beach, a toddler charged straight into the water, screaming in delight when a wave splashed up and over his stomach. His brother, a year or so older, held his mother\u2019s hand, not wanting to get close at all.</p><p>An elderly couple\u2014probably snowbirds from Canada\u2014walked barefoot, letting the water roll over their ankles. Others stayed out of reach of the waves.</p><p>Linda always chose to get her feet wet. Which would Sam do\u2014water or stay dry? Water. But probably he\u2019d growl at her for having to take off his boots. Her lips quirked. Actually, he\u2019d probably throw her in, then follow\u2014just to be contrary.</p><p>And he\u2019d undoubtedly sit out here with her, drinking coffee. Sam always took the time to look at the world. How often had they sat on his porch to watch a sunset or a dawn?</p><p>Darn it, every other thought was about the stubborn man. With her elbows on the table, she rested her chin on her hands. I love him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want me.</p><p>That was so strange, though, the way he\u2019d changed. Her brows drew together. When she\u2019d left him the morning after the disastrous scene, he\u2019d not been cold. In fact, he\u2019d teased her that she owed him for using his shoulder to cry on.</p> <p>She\u2019d been grumpy. Precoffee, not a good time. When she\u2019d grumbled at him in bed, he\u2019d rolled her over, spanked her bottom until she was blind with arousal, and indulged in a blazing quickie. Then he hadn\u2019t wanted her to go to work. Had wanted her to spend the day with him. He hadn\u2019t acted as if he wanted to pull away. To rethink their relationship.</p><p>Hours later, he\u2019d been as warm as an ice cube.</p><p>She took a sip of coffee and smiled at the realization that Betty had added extra chocolate. Sam was thoughtful like that. Every time they\u2019d been together, he\u2019d cared for her. Protected her. He\u2019d backed off if she was afraid. Pushed her when she wasn\u2019t. He cared.</p><p>Yet he\u2019d made it obvious that he was done with her. \u201cYou\u2019re better off without me.\u201d He never lied. She frowned. But what kind of a statement was that, anyway? As if he didn\u2019t think he was good for her?</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, remembering how frozen he\u2019d seemed. Not like himself at all. In fact, a normal Sam would simply say he\u2019d decided not to continue the relationship. He\u2019d be nice, but...blunt. Sam didn\u2019t pull his punches.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t see him getting all frozen up over making that kind of decision.</p><p>But on Sunday, his expression had been like hers just now in the coffee shop. All cold and pulled in against being hurt. Defenses up.</p><p>Why would he behave like that with her? She had never hurt him. Maybe someone else had? It wasn\u2019t as if the man gave much personal information. It would be easier to figure him out if he had.</p><p>But...from the hints she\u2019d picked up of his past, maybe he didn\u2019t know how to give, not without help. When she\u2019d pushed him or kept him busy with food, she could get answers out of him. Only tidbits, but that was a lot for him.</p><p>Did that matter though? She pulled in a breath, remembering how she\u2019d taken a chance. Told him she loved him. And he\u2019d hurt her. Even now, her chest squeezed, tightening enough to affect her ability to breath.</p><p>Did she want someone who could change into a different person like that?</p><p>She stared at her hands. How many times had he held hers to calm her, support her? Was she being a coward now?</p><p>A relationship was a learning experience. She\u2019d had to learn to trust him before she shared about her past. Maybe it would take more to get past Sam\u2019s defenses. Her lips pursed as she remembered how he\u2019d withdrawn when she said she\u2019d visit his place. Because he didn\u2019t have women out there, not since his divorce.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t caused his withdrawal, perhaps something else had. Maybe something from the past.</p><p>Idly rotating the cup, she considered. She\u2019d never been a quitter, and she\u2019d essentially done just that. He\u2019d said she was better off without him, and she\u2019d caved in and hadn\u2019t fought at all. She deserved\u2014no, they deserved\u2014more of a fight. Then, if it didn\u2019t work, at least she\u2019d know she tried.</p><p>So how to go about this? Drive up to his farm? Her insides curled into a ball at the thought of confronting Sam. The cold Sam.</p><p>Maybe that was asking too much of herself. She\u2019d rather find somewhere that her presence would open a dialogue. Somewhere he\u2019d have to see her. Maybe want her. She could be like a ripe apple, dangling almost in his reach.</p><p>A moment of doubt struck. What if he really didn\u2019t want her anymore? It was possible. It was a risk. She stared at the ocean. The child who\u2019d been afraid of the waves was splashing his brother, both of them giggling, drenched head to foot.</p><p>Life was full of challenges.</p><p>And Sam was worth the risk. What they had together was worth the risk.</p><p>She tapped her fingers on the rough wood of the picnic table before straightening her shoulders. She had a task to do for the Feds. Maybe she could accomplish two goals simultaneously. Down two birds with one stone.</p><p>Ignoring the stares of the people around her, she laughed aloud and felt her heart lighten. Maybe this wouldn\u2019t work, but she\u2019d darn well try. God, please let him be at the Shadowlands when I am.</p><p>Her jaw firmed. She\u2019d teach that man to talk to her instead of shutting himself away.</p><p>She started to stand, then sat down slowly. Before she could begin the battle to win Sam, she had another issue to deal with. And she was in a pissy enough mood to want to kick some butt. Time for a quick change and then a drive.</p><p>Half an hour later, after a call to Gabi\u2019s Master Marcus, she parked in front of the small brick newspaper building. Crossing the parking lot, she realized she was singing \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d under her breath. Yeah, just you wait. I\u2019m on my way. The air coming off the Gulf was sharp and salty, like a brisk slap in the face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tugged her suit jacket straight. One severely cut black suit, one dark, dark red\u2014aggressive\u2014silk shirt. No cleavage. Hair pulled back. Gold stud earrings and watch.</p><p>The look obviously worked, since when she strode into the building, the receptionist took her right into the owner/editor\u2019s office. Curtis Bentley rose as she entered and shook her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Ms. Madison? Are you here about the secretarial opening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d As they both sat, she gave him a small smile. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if you recognize my name. My house has been spray-painted several times with foul language. Your paper has run at least three articles about the problem. More articles about my history. Quite sensational articles.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes widened, and he straightened. \u201cAh, I\u2019m sure the facts were correctly reported.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the facts were correct. However, the sexual innuendoes could be construed as libelous, especially since I\u2019d broken off dating the reporter and he resented the fact.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bentley\u2019s back got straighter. \u201cI\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t rele\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe the law frowns upon a newspaper that commits a crime in order to increase sales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <p>Of course not. Dwayne had been the one who checked the police blotter for arrests. Probably no one had since. \u201cYour reporter, Dwayne Cowper, has been spray-painting my home with words like \u2018Filthy slut, Burn in hell.\u2019 Both for revenge and for a good story.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bentley rose. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that for a minute.\u201d</p><p>She rose as well. \u201cBelieve it. He was caught in the act. And told us his motivation. \u2018Us\u2019 includes the police.\u201d She fixed the man with a cold, cold look. \u201cI\u2019m afraid a jury would find it appalling that a victim of a crime is victimized by a newspaper trying to increase sales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow wait. I had no idea the man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. My lawyer will be happy to discuss both criminal and civil charges with you, I\u2019m sure.\u201d She marched out of the office, imagining Dwayne\u2019s career squishing to mush with each click of her heel.</p><p>If only her battle for Sam could be won as easily.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>The night was dark and cold as Sam strode past the few cars in the parking lot toward the Shadowlands. The black wrought-iron sconces on the stone mansion walls gave off an ominous, flickering light that matched his grim mood.</p><p>For the last few days, all he could think about was the hurt in Linda\u2019s eyes. Dammit, he wanted her back, but how could he put her through this kind of crap again? Any reminders of Nancy\u2014let alone visits\u2014had an adverse effect on his mood, but he sure as hell hadn\u2019t realized how that mood could affect others.</p><p>And every time he thought about trying to explain, his throat turned dry as Death Valley.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell her. Wasn\u2019t good for her. Best to leave things the way they were or he\u2019d end up hurting her over and over.</p><p>Being in the Shadowlands wasn\u2019t going to be easy. He scowled. Damn Z for calling at the last minute to tell Sam that he needed to supervise the trainees tonight.</p><p>They\u2019d probably already be lining up.</p><p>Linda knelt in the cold entryway in the line of trainees. The subs knew why she was here, and she could feel their silent support.</p> <p>Sally leaned her shoulder against Linda\u2019s and whispered, \u201cI changed my mind. This is totally not a good idea. What if the watcher guy figures out you\u2019re trying to ID him?\u201d</p><p>Wow, way to bring her worst fear right out into the open. \u201cGuess I better not jump up and yell, \u2018Here he is! It\u2019s the bad guy.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Sally sputtered, then said, \u201cWe\u2019ll all be here for you. But don\u2019t you go anywhere isolated.\u201d</p><p>In the clubroom? Fat chance. \u201cYou\u2019re quite the mother hen, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessica\u2019s not here, so I figure it\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>I always thought that was my job. It was nice to be worried about. \u201cThank you. So what happens now with the trainees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster Cullen inspects us and gives us our assignments. Half of us are barmaids, and the other half are free to play. Then we switch off.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re polite, Master Cullen isn\u2019t too fussy. Not like some of the others who care about what we wear too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sam walked into the entry.</p><p>The air clogged in Linda\u2019s throat. She hadn\u2019t seen him since he\u2019d handed Dwayne over to the police. Since he\u2019d said she\u2019d be better off without him.</p><p>I want him to be here. Remember? But her resolve drained away, right into the wood floor. Not wanting him to see her nervousness, she dropped her gaze, but the glimpse of him was burned into her brain.</p><p>He always looked bigger in his Shadowlands gear. Rather than a vest, he wore a black suede shirt with the sleeves rolled up, showing his darkly tanned, powerful arms. His black leather pants fit like skin over his muscular thighs.</p><p>His boots stopped in front of the line. \u201cI\u2019m the trainer tonight,\u201d he said. His sandpapery voice sent a zing of need down her spine. Darn the man.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I\u2014goddammit.\u201d</p><p>One quick glance told her exactly whose presence had drawn that growl out of him. Apparently Master Z hadn\u2019t mentioned that she\u2019d joined the trainees.</p><p>That darn owner. He could have warned her that Sam would be supervising tonight. Anxiety made quivers in her chest as she stared at the floor. He\u2019d be her trainer. She gripped her thighs to hide the trembling of her fingers.</p><p>After an interminable time, he walked around the trainees. He stopped in front of one. \u201cDara, did Ben approve your boots?\u201d</p><p>Linda looked up through her eyelashes. She knew the big security guard decided if a submissive\u2019s footwear was seductive enough. Otherwise the sub had to go barefoot.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dara\u2019s voice was resentful. Understandable, since her red and black boots were perfect for her Goth outfit of a shredded red T-shirt, a tiny red vinyl skirt, a studded black belt, black jewelry, and thick black eyeliner. \u201cI just... I need the boots for this look.\u201d</p><p>Linda glanced at Ben. The guard\u2019s battered face held only worry.</p><p>\u201cIs that your choice to make, girl?\u201d Sam didn\u2019t look angry, just stern. Why did that expression always make her limbs go weak?</p><p>Tough Dara actually bowed her head. \u201cNo, Sir.\u201d When the trainee had been dressing, Linda had seen she was a female whose happiness depended on wearing the perfect outfit with the right accessories. Was Sam going to ruin her night?</p><p>Sam studied her for a minute. \u201cAfter you apologize to Ben, you have a choice. Take the boots off or take ten from his belt and wear the boots.\u201d</p><p>Linda looked down, trying not to grin. For one of the others trainees, Sam\u2019s offer might have been a make-or-break deal. But Dara liked a fair amount of pain.</p><p>\u201cThe belt, please, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded toward Ben. Dara scrambled to the guard and knelt. Poor Ben. He looked torn between laughter and embarrassment. The guy was good to everyone, especially the submissives, but he wasn\u2019t into kink at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ben,\u201d Dara said with obvious remorse.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Dara.\u201d He glanced at Sam. \u201cAn apology\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d</p><p>Dara started to rise.</p><p>\u201cNot good enough for me,\u201d Sam growled. \u201cStay there, girl, pull up your skirt, and present your ass. Ben, give me your belt.\u201d</p><p>Both of them looked shocked. Then Ben yanked his belt from his jeans, handed it to Sam, and pushed his chair away. Dara assumed the position.</p><p>A couple of Doms stopped at the desk, waiting for Ben to check them off the attendance list...and to enjoy the show.</p><p>Without speaking, Sam doubled over the belt and struck. No wrist action, just a flat slap of the leather against Dara\u2019s bottom without any warm-up.</p><p>Dara flinched, and her hands clenched as Sam continued. Slap, slap, slap. Linda counted silently. At nine, Dara squeaked. At an even ten, Sam straightened. \u201cUp.\u201d</p><p>Dara knelt up, tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you like getting punished in the entry?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>Dara shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou figure Ben enjoyed watching you being hurt?\u201d</p><p>Linda\u2019s jaw dropped. Everyone\u2019s attention turned to the guard.</p><p>Ben\u2019s face was pale, his jaw tight.</p><p>Dara looked horrified. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ben.\u201d Her voice shook.</p><p>Before Ben could speak, Sam said, \u201cYou\u2019re serving drinks first shift, Dara, in the dungeon. You got off easy, girl, because the boots are cute.\u201d His lips quirked before he gave her a flat stare. \u201cDon\u2019t push your luck a second time.\u201d He jerked his chin in the direction of the door, and she fled.</p><p>Taking a baby wipe from the basket on Ben\u2019s desk, Sam cleaned off the man\u2019s belt and handed it back. He gave the younger man the same harsh stare. \u201cThe trainees are here to hook up with a Dom, Ben. You do them no favors if you let them get away with crap.\u201d</p><p>Ben nodded.</p><p>Linda realized her hands were wrapped around her waist. The way Sam had punished Dara was frightening; nonetheless...I want that. Wanted it and didn\u2019t. Her stomach felt fluttery, her chest tight. The punishment had been too similar to that of the slavers yet...different. Sam had given Dara a choice, taking into account not only what she owed to Ben, but also her need to wear her cute boots. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His dry sense of humor popped up at the oddest times.</p><p>Sam checked over the others, assigned them, and dismissed them, until only Linda was left. Lovely.</p><p>He motioned with his fingers for her to stand. She rose, keeping her gaze on the floor.</p><p>When he lifted her chin, his calloused hand was warm and familiar, as if the feel of him was lodged in her soul. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to do this, Linda.\u201d</p> <p>She saw the crease between his brows, the tenseness in his face. Oh, he cared, the stubborn, closed-off cretin. \u201cNobody tells me what I can do. Not now.\u201d</p><p>After studying her for a long moment, he repeated, \u201cNot now?\u201d</p><p>He really didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhen I was younger, if I\u2019d known about any of this, I might have wanted a full-time D/s relationship\u2014maybe\u2014but that changed when I was kidnapped.\u201d His hand smelled of soap with the faintest trace of horses. She wanted to kiss his palm. She forced herself to stand still.</p><p>His face had grown cold and remote, the moment of concern gone as if it had never happened, and the loss hurt her.</p><p>Her words spilled out. \u201cYou look at me now like they did\u2014like I\u2019m not human. God, they probably showed more feeling to their dogs.\u201d</p> <p>Sam stiffened as if she\u2019d struck him. His hand dropped.</p><p>Oh, she hadn\u2019t meant to say that. To attack him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s how I feel, but that wasn\u2019t what I meant to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry again, then,\u201d he said evenly.</p><p>She swallowed and chose her words carefully. \u201cYou and I talked about this before. It\u2019s about taking orders. The slavers dictated everything\u2014shower, grooming, food, even bathroom times. Knowing we were...programmed...to obey scares me.\u201d She pulled in a breath and met his gaze. \u201cI like being submissive. But I need to choose when I hand over control. And the rest of the time, I have to own myself. Make my own choices. Especially decisions on what risks I\u2019ll take. I\u2019m not merchandise.\u201d</p><p>Of course he\u2019d have a problem with seeing her in danger. Had she ever met anyone more protective? His face wasn\u2019t expressionless now; she could actually see his need to keep her safe warring with his desire to give her what she required for herself.</p><p>Finally he stepped back. \u201cFirst shift, you barmaid in the main room. We\u2019ll discuss the second shift when the time comes.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes closed briefly in relief, even as her fingers chilled and fear started to rise. \u201cThank you, Sam.\u201d</p><p>His chin lifted toward the door, silently telling her to go.</p><p>She headed for the door, forcing her feet forward rather than running back to him, throwing herself into his arms, and begging him to keep her safe.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look back. No, not at all. Because if he saw how terrified she was, he\u2019d never let her through the door.</p><p>\u201cYou look at me now like they did...showed more feeling to their dogs.\u201d Sam walked through the Shadowlands as Linda\u2019s words swirled through his memory. Painfully.</p><p>The club was coming to life. Cullen and Andrea were setting up the bar. At the sound system, Z was choosing the music for the evening.</p><p>Sam shook his head. It was a crying shame Z would play country-western music only on the rare western-theme nights.</p><p>Sam stepped up to the bar. \u201cGot a water back there?\u201d</p> <p>Andrea\u2019s whiskey-colored hair blanketed her shoulders as she brought him a bottle. She set it on the bar top. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so great. Are you feeling all right?\u201d</p><p>Cullen\u2019s sub was almost as observant as her Dom. \u201cLong week. And Z saddled me with the trainees again, damn him.\u201d</p><p>Andrea grinned and looked past Sam. \u201cHear that, Master Z?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOddly enough, the trainees say they enjoy having you as a trainer.\u201d Z moved from behind Sam to take a seat on a bar stool. He gave Sam a long look. \u201cAndrea is right. You don\u2019t look up to par.\u201d</p><p>Andrea turned at a call from Cullen and moved away.</p><p>\u201cI fear I didn\u2019t get a chance to warn you,\u201d Z said. \u201cI added another trainee to see how she\u2019ll work out.\u201d</p><p>Sam gave him a sour look. \u201cI noticed. How\u2019d that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps submissives shouldn\u2019t be allowed to fraternize.\u201d</p><p>Sam snorted. \u201cGood luck. What\u2019s that got to do with Linda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey discussed the spotter.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s hand tightened on the bottle of water until the plastic crackled. \u201cJessica talked to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Linda did. Then Sally suggested a trainee position so Linda could meet all the members without being obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hogwash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy first reaction. She\u2019s been through too much already.\u201d Z leaned one elbow on the bar, turning toward Sam. \u201cBuchanan and Kouros found it an excellent idea. And she agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is she so determined?\u201d Sam remembered her panic during the scene last week. She\u2019d scared the crap out of him.</p><p>\u201cMixture of reasons.\u201d Z rubbed his temple as if his head hurt. \u201cA bit of healthy payback motivation. I enjoyed that. Wanting to fight past her fears.\u201d He sighed. \u201cMostly to protect the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat damned maternal instinct,\u201d Sam muttered.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Z stared across the bar at nothing. \u201cKim once mentioned how important Linda was to her and the other slaves. Apparently she mothered them all.\u201d</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened between you two?\u201d Z asked.</p><p>Sam gave him a cold look.</p><p>\u201cNormally, your relationship wouldn\u2019t be my business, no. But she\u2019s now a trainee.\u201d</p><p>And the Shadowlands owner stood as Master to the trainees. Sam drank some water, his throat desert dry. \u201cShe wanted more than I can give.\u201d Wanted him to love her. Worse, to be able to say it.</p><p>\u201cYes? You have money enough to support a woman. You\u2019re obviously adequate with both sex and scenes\u2014submissives beg for your attention. You\u2019re smart, careful, controlled.\u201d Z tapped his fingers on the bar. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you giving her?\u201d</p><p>Sam stared at him.</p><p>Z\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cThat says it all. You\u2019re not talking to her?\u201d</p><p>Goddamned psychologist. Sam thumped the bottle of water onto the bar top. \u201cThat\u2019s not who I am, dammit.\u201d</p><p>Z studied him as if he were a submissive. \u201cYou never told your mother that you loved her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d Every bedtime. When leaving the house. Whenever she\u2019d said it to him, and she had often. The words had come easily enough. \u201cLove you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were young, did you tell your girlfriend your concerns about school? Making ends meet?\u201d Z waited for an answer.</p><p>Sam frowned, trying to remember. In the military. Complaining about a hard-ass lieutenant\u2014one who reminded him of his stepfather. As a civilian, attending college at night. Telling...Tammy\u2014that was her name\u2014about how he worried over his grades. \u201cGuess I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about your daughter? Do you discuss your worries about the farm? Or tell her what she means to you?\u201d</p><p>Sam opened his mouth. Closed it. How long had it been since he\u2019d said anything like that to her?</p><p>Z straightened. \u201cAt one time, you were that kind of a person. Now you\u2019re not. To me, that says you changed because of some experience.\u201d</p><p>Sam frowned, knowledge getting a good clamp on his guts. He\u2019d experienced Nancy.</p><p>\u201cThink about it. Figure out if you want that experience to determine the rest of your life.\u201d Z took a few steps away before glancing back with a slight smile. \u201cBe nice to the trainees, please. There\u2019s a new one tonight, and she\u2019s nervous.\u201d</p><p>Goddammit.</p><p>After stewing at the bar for far too long, Sam headed through the room to check on his trainees. He stopped near the back to watch old Gerald strapping his wife to a whipping post. At least seventy, Martha was what Sam would consider a lightweight masochist. But pain fulfilled something in her, both in her submission to Gerald and erotically.</p><p>Once Martha was restrained, Gerald swatted her ass with a narrow paddle, watching her as if she were a Playboy bunny. After a few blows, he leaned down and tucked a stray lock of gray hair behind her ear. He was speaking softly.</p><p>But Sam could hear him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Martha mine. Love seeing you wiggle. Love seeing you pant. Love you, period.\u201d</p><p>The look in her eyes was...indescribable.</p><p>Sam walked away. That\u2019s what Linda wanted. That baring of the soul. Emotions. Z hit the nail right on the head. Damn Nancy for messing with his mind. Damn himself for letting her and retreating so far he couldn\u2019t give Linda what she needed. So far that she compared him to a slaver.</p><p>Near the end of the room, Sam saw a Dom considering some of the paddles hanging on the wall. Z didn\u2019t bother with artwork\u2014not when he had toys to display. Maybe Sam should decorate his walls that way too. He frowned, remembering the painting that used to hang over the mantel\u2014one of the farmhouse when it was first built.</p><p>Nancy had destroyed it in a tantrum. With the talent of a manipulator, she\u2019d destroyed anything they loved. Sometimes just objects, other times nonphysical prizes\u2014memories and emotions. Whatever she discovered about a person, she later used as a weapon. He\u2019d learned to keep everything to himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam\u2019s throat tightened. How had that affected his little girl? After a minute, he realized Nicole had bottled up her emotions, but just with her mother. She still talked with others, laughed, showed how she felt. Nicole pushed away only Nancy.</p><p>Sam had locked all the doors with himself inside. Nicole was stronger than he was.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d A light touch on his arm. \u201cI mean, Master Sam?\u201d</p><p>He straightened and looked down. Linda.</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Concern filled her gentle eyes. For him. He\u2019d been rude to her, had pulled away, and she still worried about him. The woman hadn\u2019t a clue how special she was. Or what she meant to him. His fault.</p><p>\u201cLinda\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking about, but stop.\u201d Her expression showed only sweetness as she put her arms around him. \u201cI love you, Sam. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t feel the same, but honey, I do love you.\u201d</p><p>Warmth spread through him, dissolving the ice that had started to grow. He put his arms around her and pulled her closer. She didn\u2019t know what she was offering. She shouldn\u2019t love a person so messed up.</p><p>\u201cFigure out if you want that experience to determine the rest of your life.\u201d Did he let Nancy win, or did he fight? He swallowed. \u201cI told you that my ex-wife is a drug addict. She always needed drugs, and she\u2019d use anything I told her as ammunition to get what she wanted. I stopped sharing.\u201d</p> <p>Linda didn\u2019t look up, just tightened her grip.</p><p>His mouth flattened. \u201cNancy came to the farm last Sunday. That\u2019s why\u2014\u201d Hell, how did people do this? He couldn\u2019t. He pulled her closer, not wanting to let her go. But he must. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not good for you, girl.\u201d He gently set her from him and walked\u2014fled\u2014toward the dungeon.</p><p>LINDA SAGGED AGAINST the back of a couch, staring after Sam. She\u2019d said she loved him\u2014and he\u2019d hugged her as if it meant something to him. And he\u2019d apologized and shared. His ex sounded purely horrible.</p><p>He\u2019d held her before pushing her away. Her lips curved. He\u2019d said one thing\u2014his hug had said another.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, what was all that about?\u201d Sally slipped an arm around her and leaned her hip on the couch. \u201cHe sure didn\u2019t look happy with you.\u201d</p><p>Linda shook her head. \u201cHe told me something about his ex. She sounds like a real bitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously? He never talks about his wife. Or much of anything else, come to think of it.\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d opened up for her, cracked his wall of silence. I love you, Sam, and I see you\u2019re trying. Don\u2019t give up\u2014we can do this. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely confusing me.\u201d She huffed a sigh. \u201cBut I can\u2019t think about it now. Time to get to work.\u201d She had a slaver to find.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the other side of the room,\u201d Sally said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll try to keep an eye on you.\u201d</p><p>Linda gave her a squeeze. \u201cThanks.\u201d And Sam would watch over her. She never doubted that for a second.</p><p>See who was now a trainee. The spotter pretended to watch a girl-on-girl scene as he studied the redheaded ex-slave. Quite interesting that she\u2019d become one of Z\u2019s trainees. He could see her getting involved with a Dom\u2014after all, the Association \u201charvested\u201d women in the lifestyle. But the trainee duties seemed rather beneath her.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t complaining though. Now he\u2019d have a chance to enjoy her. A pale- redhead whose skin would mark up beautifully. He liked seeing the results of his efforts.</p><p>He also preferred the older women, who were less brittle than the young ones, more adaptable, with a stronger core.</p><p>And he loved breaking masochists. If they were terrified enough or the pain was the type they hated, he could keep them out of subspace. Hurt them in ways that made them scream.</p> <p>He was uncomfortably hard as the redhead walked past the bar. Unfortunately, since she was a new trainee, he\u2019d get no chance at her tonight. But eventually? Most definitely.</p><p>Maybe he could talk her into meeting him somewhere. He needed some relief. His kills had been discovered, and the reporters were having a field day announcing a serial killer who chopped off his victim\u2019s hair. And that the women were all prostitutes. Last night in the red-light district, he\u2019d spotted four plainclothes officers. Even worse, the whores weren\u2019t getting into cars.</p><p>As he watched her talk with people, he frowned. Her demeanor seemed...off. After greeting a Dom, she\u2019d tilt her head as if listening intently and the man would get a careful study. Her attitude wasn\u2019t that of a submissive looking for a master.</p><p>Uneasiness made him stiffen as she walked past. Her gaze flickered over him. When her body language didn\u2019t change, he relaxed. She didn\u2019t recognize him.</p><p>She would though.</p><p>He\u2019d enjoy reminding her of where they\u2019d \u201cmet.\u201d Right before he started on her with his knife.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Later that evening, Sam released the first shift of trainees and put the second shift to work as barmaids. After matching Dara and Sally with Doms who fit their interests, he saw Linda moving toward the bar.</p><p>She walked past the two FBI agents who were\u2014apparently\u2014arguing the merits of a female president, and set her tray of empties in front of Cullen.</p><p>\u201cThank you, pet,\u201d the bartender said. As he tugged her hair, she gave that low, open laugh that always lifted Sam\u2019s spirits.</p><p>Damn, he\u2019d missed her.</p><p>A Dom seated at the bar chatted with her and ran his hand down her bare upper arm. Her back muscles tightened. She didn\u2019t like the guy\u2019s touch.</p><p>Sam stalked over. \u201cTrainee. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder, and her eyes widened. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d To Sam\u2019s satisfaction, she obeyed instantly, pulling away from the Dom.</p><p>Sam closed his hand around her nape, enjoying the shiver she gave at his touch, then guided her to a quieter place in the room. \u201cYou got any idea of what you want to do now, girl?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job to see that you meet Doms and explore the areas you\u2019re interested in.\u201d Z, with typical thoroughness, had made Linda complete the trainee paperwork, including a limits list. Earlier, Sam had checked the file and noted activities they hadn\u2019t tried.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not here to, uh, explore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He moved forward, past her personal boundary and into intimate space. Another inch and her gorgeous breasts would rub against his chest. Or his rapidly hardening cock would nudge her lower stomach.</p><p>Rather than stepping back, she made an infinitesimal movement toward him.</p><p>Oh, hell yeah, she still wanted him. \u201cPart of the night is saved for a trainee to gain experience, and it will look odd if you don\u2019t. Got anyone in mind you want to play with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay with...someone?\u201d She pulled in a breath. \u201cOf course. I-I knew that.\u201d He watched as she recovered. \u201cI can do that. I did the first time I came here, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>So damned brave. He might have called her bluff, but she wasn\u2019t in a good place to be teased. His hand moved of its own accord and cupped her cheek. \u201cLinda, it\u2019s your choice. Would you rather play with me?\u201d</p><p>The answer showed so clearly in her beautiful brown eyes that he didn\u2019t need her to speak. Although the hesitation before she said, \u201cYes. If you wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d felt like an insult.</p><p>For the insult, he answered, \u201cNo problem. Part of the job.\u201d</p><p>At the flicker of hurt in her face, he cursed himself and curved his hands on each side of her neck, letting his thumbs stroke her jawline. \u201cMore than that, girl.\u201d He pushed past the bottleneck on his words and continued. \u201cI\u2019d like to play with you. I always have.\u201d Always will.</p><p>Tears gleamed in her eyes before she blinked them back. \u201cOkay. Okay then. Now what?\u201d</p><p>Tough little woman. Too damn tough and brave for her own good. \u201cAre you up for a full scene? Pain, bondage, sex?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, and he could read her too easily. Her head said no, but the rest of her wanted him. The relief that she hadn\u2019t given up on them shook him.</p><p>When she nodded, he couldn\u2019t keep from moving closer. From kissing her. He\u2019d missed the pleasure of taking her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s a good night for role-playing.\u201d</p><p>She looked intrigued. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Like a scene he\u2019d planned a while back. Her speech in the entry about being programmed had shoved it to the top of the list. \u201cA reversal of the businessman-secretary role-play. A game within a game.\u201d</p><p>Her brows drew together.</p><p>\u201cI give you tasks and ask questions. You must answer honestly. But I also want you to act out. Be a brat. Be rude. Do the tasks badly. When you do, you\u2019ll get rewarded by being punished in a way we\u2019ll both like. However, if you\u2019re quiet and well-behaved, I\u2019ll make you do things you won\u2019t find appealing.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain later. Maybe.\u201d Would she figure it out? He rubbed her cheek with his knuckles, enjoying the softness. \u201cUpstairs in the Purple Room, Z keeps fetish and costume wear. Put on secretarial clothing. No underwear. Hair up off your neck. Glasses. Bring me a suit coat when you come down. Extra-large. I\u2019ll see you in the office-theme room in ten minutes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She simply stood, staring at him.</p><p>He put a low snap in his voice. \u201cMove, girl.\u201d</p><p>Wow, she really felt like a secretary. As she crossed the club and walked down the theme-room hallway, a few members grinned, recognizing the stereotypical look. Her black skirt hugged her butt more closely than she liked, but the white silk blouse she might have bought for herself. Without a bra, her nipples made dark points under the thin material. But the black reading glasses\u2014without lenses\u2014were great.</p><p>The hall contained people observing scenes through the large windows. The medical room was across from the office room, and she glanced in, then winced. A Domme was inserting needles in a straight line down one side of her submissive\u2019s muscular back. The man flinched with each puncture, but from his expression, he was in a happy place.</p> <p>Linda felt envious. Not of the piercing\u2014heavens, no. But the subspace. She felt as if centuries had passed since she\u2019d played with Sam.</p><p>As she opened the door, she saw him and felt that inexplicable bounce of her heart. He waited beside a fancy oak desk in a room fashioned to look like an office. A tall filing cabinet stood against one wall. A chair sat in front of the desk. A couch and coffee table were near the far wall.</p><p>After donning the suit coat she\u2019d fetched, he gave her an approving smile. \u201cMiss Madison, I\u2019m Sam Davies, the CEO of Pain International.\u201d He held his hand out.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Right. Get with the program. She shook his hand. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a seat. We\u2019ll get right to the interview.\u201d</p> <p>Interview? She blinked, then shrugged and took the hardwood chair in front of the massive oak desk. At least she wouldn\u2019t have to pretend to take notes in shorthand.</p><p>After seating himself behind the desk, Sam opened a red folder and actually donned his reading glasses to peruse the contents. He was so, so sexy with glasses.</p><p>He nodded to himself as he read. When he frowned at another paper, her hands turned clammy as if she were really applying for a job. Finally he looked up and pinned her with a keen gaze over the top of his glasses. \u201cA widow. Children in college. How much trouble do they give you?\u201d</p><p>Huh. He really meant to keep this interviewlike. \u201cNot much. They\u2019re quite good children, aside from being at that rebellious age.\u201d</p><p>His gaze chilled. \u201cHow nice to meet an honest and polite applicant.\u201d The compliment was at definite odds with his annoyed look. Why? He knocked the pencil holder off the desk. \u201cOops. Pick those up while I read the rest of this report.\u201d</p><p>Pushing her glasses up, she obediently knelt on the gleaming hardwood floor, righted the holder, and put the first pencil in.</p> <p>He sighed. \u201cSo goddamned well behaved. Use your teeth then.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him and caught his direct look. Realized why. He\u2019d told her to be rude. Honest, but rude. If she were \u201cquiet or well-behaved,\u201d he\u2019d choose things she didn\u2019t like. Well, he was sure on target with picking up pencils with her teeth. Ew.</p><p>Must be rude. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty clumsy, Davies. You should pick them up yourself.\u201d She felt...odd...saying that. \u201cDon\u2019t be impertinent, honey. It\u2019s important that you\u2019re always polite.\u201d Her mama\u2019s voice distorted and slid into the Overseer\u2019s. \u201cSluts don\u2019t speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Madison, are you applying for a job or taking a nap down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d As she reached for a pencil, his frown stopped her. Rude. Be rude. Not knowing what to say, she picked up a pencil and threw it onto the desk. Everything inside her cringed at the action. \u201cThere\u2019s one.\u201d</p><p>She caught the glint of approval and threw two more. \u201cAlmost done, Mr. Dumb Davies.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked. \u201cEnough of that. Come here.\u201d</p><p>She rose, took a step forward, and realized she was doing it again. Blind passive obedience. \u201cNo.\u201d She dropped into her chair. \u201cGet on with the interview before I get bored.\u201d</p> <p>His eyebrows went up. \u201cBored?\u201d He flipped a page. \u201cSmall-town girl. Your father was pastor of a church? Pretty straitlaced, I bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Why is it so hard to be rude? \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d She sprawled out, her legs extended.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just racking up punishments, Miss Madison. Behave yourself.\u201d</p><p>Before she could stop, she sat upright, knees together, hands in lap. \u201cMy daughter is a good girl. Did you see how well she sat and listened to the sermon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicely obedient.\u201d Sam sounded disgusted. \u201cBend over and let me see your ass.\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed. \u201cThat isn\u2019t fair. I...\u201d Obeyed you. I was good. He didn\u2019t want her to be good. To be polite. Her brain felt as if it were playing a song with dissonant chords.</p><p>\u201cNow. Not next week.\u201d</p><p>She rose and turned and\u2014dummy. She spun back around. \u201cWhat kind of a CEO are you? That\u2019s just disgusting.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cGabi should give you some pointers on how to be insulting.\u201d He rose and walked around the desk. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>The look in his eyes had her backing toward the door. \u201cUh-uh.\u201d</p><p>Taking a step forward, he caught her shirt by the front and yanked her to the desk, then bent her facedown over it. Still holding her shirt, keeping her bent over, Sam lifted her skirt and ran his hand over her bottom. \u201cI like the way you just give in. An excellent robot.\u201d</p><p>Robot? \u201cLet me go, you bastard!\u201d She was learning. She started to struggle.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d His hand slapped her bottom with a brief sting; then he gave her three more that transformed into lovely sharp pleasure. \u201cThose were for the sassy talk, and so is this.\u201d When he ran his finger between her folds, she squirmed uncontrollably as need sizzled through her. He made a hum of approval at her wetness. His big finger circled her clit in a burst of sensation as he teased her.</p><p>She was just letting him. She tried to push herself up, but he held her mercilessly in place. And his touch grew more insistent. Her clit swelled as he pressed harder.</p><p>When he finally let her up, she was flushed and panting and so, so turned on. With a final hard slap of her bare bottom, he nudged her toward her chair. \u201cI have some more questions, Miss Madison.\u201d</p><p>She sat in the chair, knees together, back straight. At his raised eyebrows, she flushed. She really was an idiot. \u201cSo far your questions haven\u2019t shown any intelligence on your part.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as if in appreciation of the crappy insult. \u201cChurch daughter. Raised to be a good girl. Bet you never question if you should obey the person giving orders. You just do what they say, don\u2019t you, little girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She did. \u201cYou arrogant bastard, what would you know about being respectable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet your husband was real respectable. Conservative. Wanted you to be the same. Answer me, Miss Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014\u201d Her mouth snapped shut, and she glared. \u201cYou can take this job and feed it to your ugly pigs.\u201d She rose.</p><p>His grin came and went so fast she almost didn\u2019t see it. \u201cNo, the interview isn\u2019t over. Do you even know what you\u2019re interviewing for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... No.\u201d</p><p>He walked around the desk and grabbed her by the nape of her neck. \u201cNeither do I. Let\u2019s see if you have any skills I\u2019d enjoy.\u201d</p><p>After pushing her into the knee space under the desk, he took his seat, lowered the chair, then moved it forward until his legs bracketed her. With sure hands, he opened his leathers. His cock rose, and she gaped at him. \u201cYou want me to suck your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He slid her glasses off and tossed them on the desk. \u201cA nice blowjob...and quietly, please.\u201d</p><p>Be rude. Obey, but be rude. He wanted rude, then fine. \u201cAre you sure I can find it? I might get it confused with one of those pencils on the floor.\u201d</p><p>He choked, even as he pushed a button on the front of the desk.</p><p>Obey. Resting a forearm on his knee to steady herself, she licked around the top of his cock before taking it into her mouth. At the taste and feel of his hard erection, desire set up a steady pulse between her legs. The velvety skin was stretched tight, the veins bulging. Mmmm. Want more. She lifted her head. \u201cSee, tiny dick. Maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shoved her head down, forcing her to take it all, effectively muffling her. And he wasn\u2019t little at all. She almost gagged as he went deep, but when his hand fisted in her hair and pulled her head up and down, the feeling of being controlled made her insides go smooshie.</p><p>\u201cSuck harder.\u201d</p><p>She did, then defiantly scraped him\u2014gently\u2014with her teeth. Under her forearms, his thigh muscles tightened. Heavens, she\u2019d missed being with him. She inhaled his musky, wonderful scent.</p><p>He pulled her hair just enough to give her goose bumps.</p><p>Relaxing her jaw, she took him deeper, enjoying the rumble of satisfaction he gave. She could climax just listening to him.</p><p>The door creaked open, letting in the noise of people in the hallway. A man said, \u201cYou rang, boss?\u201d</p><p>Linda froze and tried to pull back farther under the desk. Sam\u2019s hand in her hair kept her head bobbing, the wet sounds far, far too loud.</p><p>\u201cYes, would you tell the next candidate that I\u2019m detained,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI won\u2019t get to her for another hour.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course, sir.\u201d The man\u2019s voice came closer. \u201cIs there anything I can assist with, while I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>No. No!</p><p>Sam glanced at her and raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Linda knew she was effectively hidden by the desk, but the sounds of a blowjob... The man knew exactly what was going on. She shook her head frantically, despite the cock in her mouth.</p><p>Sam winced, then grinned. \u201cNo, thanks, Holt. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have to deal with an overly polite secretary after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. Let me know if you change your mind. I enjoy...interviews.\u201d The door closed.</p><p>My God, he\u2019d have let that man touch me? She wrenched her head up. \u201cYou jerk. How could you have done that?\u201d</p><p>He gave her an even look. \u201cA threesome wasn\u2019t listed as a hard limit for you. I wanted to see if it was something you\u2019d enjoy.\u201d He put himself away, zipped up his pants, and pulled her onto his lap.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but snuggle close. How could the damned sadist make her feel so safe when he held her?</p><p>\u201cLooked like you didn\u2019t want company, though. Why did you check it as \u2018possible\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... At the time, it seemed like an okay possibility.\u201d At the time, she\u2019d actually been thinking of ways to make Sam jealous. She sure hadn\u2019t thought he would call her on it.</p><p>His eyes narrowed, but he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Letting him think too long might not be a good idea. \u201cSo, big boss, what do we do now?\u201d She deliberately squirmed on his very hard cock. Actually, being a bad girl seemed a fine idea. Turning into him, she buried her face in the curve of his neck, inhaling the soap and hay scent before nipping his skin. She undid a button on his shirt and slid her hand in to outline his hard pectoral muscles. His crisp chest hair teased her fingers as she sought out a nipple...and pinched it.</p><p>He growled at her, pulled her hand away. \u201cGet back in your chair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, come on, Mr. Davies. I\u2019m sure I can be a great secretary.\u201d After bouncing on his cock, she pushed off his lap, opened her blouse, and shimmied her bare breasts at him.</p><p>As his blue eyes turned to a molten steel color, his whole body seemed to expand.</p><p>Uh-oh, maybe that wasn\u2019t such a good idea, she thought, even as her skin seemed to burst into flame.</p><p>He rose, grabbed her upper arms, and yanked her against him, then took her lips in a kiss so demanding, so wet and hot that her knees buckled. Slinging an arm around her, he kept kissing her, even as his other hand cupped her bare breast. When he rolled the nipple and pinched the tip\u2014hard\u2014a stream of need flowed to her clit. \u201cI can see you want to be punished, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... Ah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter that, I\u2019m going to fuck you.\u201d She could hear the control in his voice. \u201cHurt you and fuck you so hard that everyone in the club hears you scream my name.\u201d</p><p>Oh. God.</p><p>After folding his glasses and putting them in his pocket, he lifted her onto the desk. \u201cKneel up in position.\u201d</p><p>At the growl in his voice, she felt as if she\u2019d stepped sideways into somewhere softer. Brighter.</p> <p>Feeling wanted was wonderful. Being understood and still wanted was even better. On top of the desk, she set her butt on her feet. Her hands rested on her thighs.</p><p>\u201cGood. Arch your back.\u201d</p><p>When she complied, his cheek creased with his half smile before he ran his hand over her breasts. His calluses were rough and wonderful on her sensitized skin. \u201cLove these tits, girl.\u201d</p><p>So blunt. Yet the wash of happiness couldn\u2019t be denied.</p><p>He tugged at her nipples until her breasts seemed to sizzle. \u201cStay just like that,\u201d he warned before bending down to his toy bag beside the desk. After setting a pair of bandage scissors on the desk, he took a length of rope and circled the base of her left breast several times, slightly tighter than was comfortable. Then he did the right.</p><p>Now instead of feeling swollen, her breasts felt as if they\u2019d burst.</p><p>His gaze on her face, he fondled each breast and pinched the engorged nipples. Such intense heat lanced through her that she whined and wiggled.</p><p>When he lifted breast clamps from his bag, she made a protest that didn\u2019t even sound like her. He knew she was sensitive there. Knew she hated those things.</p><p>He barked a laugh, and delight gleamed in his hard gaze. \u201cYes, this will really hurt,\u201d he said, openly enjoying how she tried to cringe away. The first one went on, an alligator clamp with a screw. He adjusted the pressure.</p><p>\u201cToo tight,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, Linda. Breathe through it. Take it for me...and for you.\u201d Curving his unyielding hand under her breast, he watched her face.</p><p>She pulled in a breath, trying to ride the pain. Not a good pain. But his words. \u201cFor me.\u201d She\u2019d do it to please him, to see the approval in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cReady for the next one?\u201d</p><p>Tears had pooled in her eyes, and she shook her head no. The shocking bite had lessened, blossoming into a wonderful fiery pleasure, but still...</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d And he did the other one.</p><p>She gasped as the prongs closed on her sensitive nipple, hurting, hurting, and the fact that he\u2019d force her to take the unwelcome hurt shook everything inside her, because she wanted him to push her. To ignore her protests, to make her submit to his will. As he watched her with those mesmerizing blue eyes, she felt as if layers of her skin were being stripped away\u2014a fruit being peeled until only the soft core remained.</p><p>He attached a chain between the two clamps, letting the cool metal drop against her skin. \u201cOpen your knees.\u201d</p><p>His gaze never left her face as he ran his hand between her legs, sliding through her wetness. He plunged two fingers inside her. Her pussy contracted around him, pulsing and pulling, sending zaps to every nerve, somehow bouncing off the raw soreness in her breasts and expanding.</p><p>He moved closer, sharing the warmth of his body. With fingers still inside her, he used his free hand to grip her hair, tugging her head back so he could take her lips. So he could rub his chest on her clamped nipples, increasing the glorious pain until she whimpered. He took her further, his control over her merciless as he penetrated her mouth and pussy so intimately her head spun.</p><p>Thrusting his fingers deeper, he circled his thumb around her clit, pushing her up the slope toward a climax.</p><p>As her thigh muscles started to tremble and her insides to contract, he withdrew and stepped back, smiling into her needy eyes. \u201cPretty Linda.\u201d He paused for a second. Then his voice grated lower. \u201cYou make me happy, girl. Happy to fuck you.\u201d He cupped her cheek and gritted out, as if he drew the words from a bottomless well, \u201cHappy to be with you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart melted into slush, pooling in her chest. \u201cSam,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo talking, missy. Moaning is allowed...if you\u2019re able.\u201d</p><p>Able?</p><p>He firmly positioned her on her knees and forearms, head down. He yanked her butt up into the air. \u201cStay there.\u201d When he picked up the chain dangling between her breasts, she squeaked at the sharp bite from the nipple clamps. He put the chain in her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>Hastily, she bent her head so the pull on the clamps stopped, then looked up at him through her lashes. Expression unyielding, he held her eyes, and her whole body sparkled to life.</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cEager, are you?\u201d He ran his hands down her back to massage her bottom. Warm and caring and wonderful. The hum in her head, in her veins, deepened as if she were falling down a steep slope.</p><p>He slapped her bottom lightly at intervals, and she wanted more. Wanted him inside her. Her core felt hollow.</p><p>Then he took a flogger from his toy bag. The scent of leather was heady as he ran the strands over her, like tiny fingers trailing on her back and bottom. The falls struck, pattering against her skin. She kept her head down, savoring the massage-like thumps and glorying in it as he hit harder and pain blossomed on her skin. Only it wasn\u2019t pain but a driving pleasure. Then down to her thighs and bottom. She moaned as more layers of herself seemed to peel away.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he grated in his harsh voice. \u201cYou can take this. Want this. Moan for me now.\u201d The flogging grew harder. Each blow surged through her in a sensual inferno, sizzling straight to her pussy and clit, making her insides clench. His laugh affected her the very same way.</p><p>He tossed the flogger back onto his bag and removed something else. Gripping her thigh, he pushed a finger inside her. Her vagina clenched around the penetration. Needing. Needing. She moaned.</p><p>\u201cWant something in there, girl?\u201d His chuckle was low. Ominous. \u201cAt least until I can get there myself?\u201d</p><p>She did. Oh, she did. How slutty she was. But it felt so good to simply need with nothing else involved.</p><p>Something slid into her vagina, fairly wide, then smaller so it would stay in. Vibrations hit, and her back arched. As her head lifted, the chain in her mouth jerked on her nipples, and the sharp bite of the clamps almost made her come. \u201cOoohhhh.\u201d</p><p>His rough hands ran over her shoulders and ass before he nipped the back of her neck. His low voice rumbled in her ear. \u201cSounds like you\u2019re in a good place, girl, and ready for more.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t talk, not with the chain. Her careful nod satisfied him.</p><p>He reached under her, fondling her breasts, reminding her how they were bound, making them throb with the pressure inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two canes came out of his bag. He laid a small, thin one beside her forearm in a visible threat and kept the other. It was leather covered and thick. He tapped it over the backs of her thighs, up her bottom, letting her get acquainted with the feel. Whack, whack, whack.</p><p>Pushing her, edging her upward, the blows grew harder with a heavy thumping. Her favorite kind of hurting. Then he targeted the same spots he\u2019d hit before. Like the orchestra joining in on a solo, the new sensation drowned everything else out and united the individual pieces into waves of gorgeous pain.</p><p>Another harder strike and her head came up, wrenching her nipples. The exquisite blast made her scream around the chain and drop her head back down to ease the pressure. Her arms were shaking. Another blow. Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump. Five smacks before he\u2019d pause to let the sharpness of the pleasure swell and ease. Five more. Pause. Over and over.</p><p>Through it all, the vibrator never ceased.</p><p>The battle to keep her head down, to take more, split her mind, floating her away until it seemed as if her hands were buried in fog. Nothing stood between her and the world. Her shell had cracked open, leaving her exposed. But not chilled. Warm. She was so warm as Sam ran his hands over her. Said something.</p><p>\u201cLinda, are you with me?\u201d His voice penetrated, pulled at her, anchored her from drifting completely away.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>He snorted and pulled the chain from her mouth. \u201cSay my name.\u201d</p><p>Name? Fuzzy. \u201cS-Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Take this again.\u201d The chain went back in her mouth, and she tongued the cool metal. He caressed her head, rubbed his cheek on hers, leaving his scent behind to flow into her happy place. \u201cYou can take more.\u201d</p><p>Each blow felt as if it should hurt, and tears were in her eyes, yet her whole body throbbed with arousal and need. Each strike of the cane reverberated through her straight to her clit. Her moans increased as she rocked back toward the cane, pleading for more. For more.</p><p>But the heavy blows stopped, and he picked up the cane beside her arm. The little one.</p><p>His hands pulled her knees apart, opening her, and she clenched as the vibrator jostled inside her.</p><p>Then light taps ran up the inside of her thighs, the cane flicking back and forth like a pinball, up and down with tiny, hot stings, just enough sensation to keep her floating. But he never struck her throbbing pussy. Up and up her tender thighs, then down, then up. Never quite...there. She moaned her need.</p><p>Her breath caught as he flicked the cane to hit the crease between her thigh and pussy. So close. He struck her labia, even the end of the vibrator, and the impacts surged through to her clit again and again. Never quite there. She gave a high, frustrated whine.</p><p>His gruff laugh was sandpaper down her spine, beautiful, wonderful sandpaper. \u201cNeedy girl. Let\u2019s finish this interview then.\u201d The next strikes changed the angle, between her legs, so the tip danced over her upper pussy lips on each side of her engorged clit. Every little blow sent her higher, higher. Then he reached between her legs, closed his fingers on her clit, and tugged.</p><p>She came, screaming around the chain as everything inside her blew apart, shaking her, shaking the table. Her back arched, her head lifted, the chain pulled. She yelled again as her nipples blasted shocking, wonderful pain straight to her core.</p><p>\u201cHell of a scream, baby.\u201d He pulled the chain from between her lips, then removed the vibrator, making her spasm again. After setting her on her feet, he bent her over the desk. As her legs wobbled, she grabbed the desk edges.</p><p>Over the roar in her ears, she heard the sound of a condom wrapper being torn open. A condom? Oh right, the Shadowlands had rules.</p><p>\u201cHang on, missy. I\u2019m gonna take you hard.\u201d</p><p>She felt the tip of his cock enter. Then he thrust in so fast and deep she went up on tiptoes, her breath whooshing out of her. Her pussy convulsed around him, and he felt so, so good, thick and hard inside. Hot and wet. But he was thrusting too slowly, and she wiggled her hips.</p><p>\u201cStay still.\u201d In reprimand, he pulled on the chain and laughed when she moaned.</p><p>He reached around her with both hands, loosening the ropes around her breasts. The ropes fell off, and her breasts were freed. As blood surged into her breasts, her pinched nipples felt as if they were on fire. Her swollen breasts throbbed with each beat of her heart.</p> <p>Then his cock pounded into her, driving her up and up. Securing her around the waist with an arm, he loosened one nipple clamp and pulled it off. Then the other. \u201cSay my name.\u201d</p><p>Blood poured back in, setting the abused tissues into engulfing brilliant fire. \u201cSaaaaam.\u201d Her scream echoed in the room</p><p>He laughed and massaged her breasts, making the sensation overwhelming.</p><p>Her brain fogged. Her body wasn\u2019t hers, was Sam\u2019s\u2014all Sam\u2019s\u2014responding to his merciless hands and cock. His cock dragged across a spot that made her moan. He angled himself to hit that place, over and over.</p><p>As she came again in heavy, clenching waves of pleasure, her head sagged. He filled her completely, mind and body, and when he pressed deep into her, taking his satisfaction, he owned her emotions as well.</p><p>MINE. ARMS AROUND his woman, Sam rested his forehead on her back, his cock pulsing inside her. With every small tremor of her body, her hot, slick sheath clenched around him, keeping him there, just past coming, so it felt as if maybe\u2014maybe\u2014he could come one more time.</p><p>He figured he\u2019d end up in a grave, but it might be worth it.</p><p>Instead, he kissed between her shoulder blades and grinned when her pussy convulsed again.</p><p>As he pulled out of her, they both sighed at the loss. Damn, but he cared for this woman.</p><p>He did.</p><p>He carefully settled her in the corner, disposed of his condom, then grabbed a blanket from a drawer in the filing cabinet. As he wrapped the fuzzy material around her, he touched her cheek gently, pleased to see her contented expression. Still in subspace. Worry-free. Happy. Far, far better than the way the last scene here had ended.</p><p>Some of her euphoria seemed to settle inside him. Putting that look on a masochist\u2019s face was definitely the icing on the cake for a sadist.</p><p>He kissed her lightly and then cleaned up the room.</p><p>After slinging his bag over his shoulder, he opened the door and picked her up. She blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cYou with me, girl?\u201d he asked, studying her face. The flush of climax had faded, but her color wasn\u2019t bad.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. A crease appeared between her dark red brows in an unhappy look. \u201cI came... People watched...?\u201d</p><p>Her words were slurred, but, remembering his screwup at the auction, he understood. \u201cNot in public, baby.\u201d As he headed for the door, he turned to show her the closed window blinds. He\u2019d pulled them when getting the canes out of his bag. She hadn\u2019t even noticed.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her cheek rubbed against him, and somehow without moving, she sank closer in his arms. A snuggler. He had regulars who didn\u2019t like aftercare other than water and carbs. Some wanted company but didn\u2019t like being touched afterward. Some liked being held.</p><p>Linda drowned in being cuddled, always trying to inch closer. He made sure his bottoms had what they needed after a scene. But Linda was different; he damn well loved aftercare with her.</p><p>In the main room, he found a secluded chair and settled in. With his free hand, he grabbed the sports drink from his bag and popped the top up. \u201cDrink, baby.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were still glazed, but the good little submissive tried to obey. Her lips closed over the bottle cap, making him remember how her mouth felt around his cock. When she sucked in some liquid, just the sound made him start to harden again. He pulled her closer and kissed the top of her head, keeping his grip on the bottle. \u201cMore, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019d taken enough to please him, he fed her pieces of a chocolate bar. Alertness started to return to her face.</p><p>A small sound made him look up. Rainie stood at the unwritten boundary, checking to see if he needed anything. Good trainee. Despite her brassy personality, she was as finely attuned to nuances as anyone he\u2019d met.</p><p>Sam ran his knuckles over Linda\u2019s cheek. A bit cooler than he liked. He said to Rainie, \u201cCan you bring a hot chocolate\u2014not too hot\u2014and a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He let Linda drop off again, tipped his head back, and simply enjoyed her soft body. He\u2019d rather have a soft, satisfied woman in his lap than a purring cat any day.</p><p>Rainie appeared, set the drinks on the end table, and moved it to the exact spot where he could reach them easily.</p><p>He nodded at her. \u201cGood job, girl. You do the trainees proud.\u201d</p><p>Before she moved away, the flush of delight in her face made him smile. He\u2019d been unconvinced of her suitability when Z had proposed her for the trainee spot, but as always, Z recognized a good submissive sooner than anyone.</p><p>Sam jiggled Linda, waited until her attention fixed on him, then held the hot chocolate to her lips.</p><p>One sip. Two. He chuckled at her blissful sigh. \u201cWarm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, baby.\u201d He studied her face. The tiny muscles around her eyes and mouth had relaxed. The tenseness of her neck and shoulders was gone. Floggers and fucking\u2014a surefire cure for what ails you.</p><p>Still partly in Domspace, he got off on the fact that he\u2019d done that for her.</p><p>Her brows drew together, and he had a moment of worry before her big brown eyes lifted. \u201cThat so-called interview... You were trying to tell me something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was.\u201d After living with a woman who was downright stupid, he valued one who was not.

You\u2019re supposed to like obedience.\u201d She handed him her chocolate, and he set it on the table.</p><p>\u201cI do. But surrender should come from the heart, not from habit, especially at first.\u201d Hell, how could he explain this? \u201cYou went straight from your preacher family to a conservative marriage.

Lot of programming there, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her mouth tightened.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your homework. Think about what you\u2019re doing. Are you offering your submission or just being a good girl? Who do you submit to and why? Who controls your behavior, you or your past?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes as his own words hit home with even more impact than Z\u2019s directive. His past controlled him. Had programmed him.</p><p>To hell with that. No more.</p> <p>\u201cHomework, huh?\u201d A tiny dimple appeared in her cheek. \u201cThank you for the lesson, Master Sam. And the reward.\u201d</p><p>He combed his fingers through her hair. Damp at the temples. Silky smooth. \u201cLinda.\u201d The words wouldn\u2019t come.

Her hand opened and pressed to his cheek. \u201cI love you, Sam.\u201d</p><p>He felt as if he\u2019d been dragged behind the plow. For years. Her palm was still on his face; he put his hand over hers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. About last week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I understand.\u201d She asked gently, \u201cNicole. Did she...? Why didn\u2019t you...?\u201d</p><p>Get a divorce sooner. He filled in the rest of the sentence. Little mama with her big heart, worrying about his daughter. \u201cI\u2019d told Nancy I was a sadist. We never played, but she knew. Because of that, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get sole custody.\u201d He felt the frustration flood his system. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave Nicole with her\u2014not even part-time\u2014so we...hung on until my lawyer had enough to sway the judge and Nicole was old enough they\u2019d listen to her wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey.\u201d She had the softest velvety-brown eyes he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still around. Takes me a while to get past the memories when I see her. Give me time if it happens again.\u201d</p><p>Her head cocked, and her eyebrows rose. \u201cI will. As long as you realize that I\u2019ll bitch slap you if you give me that \u2018you\u2019re better off without me\u2019 bullshit.\u201d</p><p>His laugh eased a knot in his chest he hadn\u2019t realized was there.</p><p>A flicker of movement caught his attention. Uzuri stood in almost the same place as Rainie had.</p><p>\u201cUzuri,\u201d Sam acknowledged with a sigh. He\u2019d actually forgotten he was in charge of the trainees.</p> <p>\u201cSally wants permission to play with Jake, and I\u2019d like help negotiating with a new Dom.\u201d</p><p>He shifted Linda in his arms and pulled his mind back to reality. They were good girls to remember to check in with him first. But... He studied Uzuri long enough to make her shift her weight nervously.</p><p>She needed to learn to negotiate on her own\u2014to ask for what she wanted. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you both at the bar in a couple of minutes. Then you\u2019ll practice telling me what you want out of a scene before you discuss it with the Dom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-but\u2014\u201d</p><p>After giving her a warning look that sent her hastening back to the bar, he grinned. The girl was shy, timid with strangers\u2014especially strange Doms\u2014but once she knew someone, all bets were off.</p><p>He\u2019d smacked her ass a couple of times for saucy talk. The next night, in the Master\u2019s area, he\u2019d opened his toy bag and found it had been emptied and filled with real toys. A miniature whip. Plastic handcuffs. A six-inch flogger made of fluffy yarn. A teddy bear in rope bondage. Its ball gag made of string and a grape had set off the entire roomful of Doms. Probably heard their laughter in Tampa.</p><p>After Nolan tied her to a bar stool as punishment for something, she\u2019d filled all the Dos Equis bottles with cranberry juice and somehow put the tops back on. Nolan had spit the sweet stuff all over the well-polished bar, and Cullen had cursed up a blue streak.</p><p>Cullen\u2019s misstep with the little trainee had resulted in a naked Barbie doll tied to one of his \u201cbar ornament\u201d rings.</p><p>Yep, the Dom who won the little brat\u2019s surrender would be in for a surprise.</p><p>Seemed that life was full of surprises. Sam looked down at the submissive in his lap, feeling as if he\u2019d been in a battle and returned home, safe and sound. \u201cHow are you doing, girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d She slid off his lap and onto her feet. Her legs were steady, but he regretted the loss of her sweet body already. \u201cI need to get to work. Listening.\u201d Her face scrunched up. \u201cI\u2019m so, so glad I didn\u2019t hear anything while...\u201d</p><p>During their scene? Did she think he\u2019d chosen a closed theme room and shut the windows by accident? Damn, he hated having her at risk. \u201cBe careful. As trainer, I say no more scenes for you tonight. Spend the rest of it waiting on tables. If someone wants you, you tell them just that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did I mention that you\u2019re coming home with me tonight?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Linda sipped a root beer and studied the papers Marcus had spread over the coffee table in his living room.</p><p>In the kitchen, Gabi and Beth were rattling dishes and laughing as they carried lunch out to the patio. \u201cHurry up, you two. It\u2019s time to eat,\u201d Gabi called.</p><p>Better stop worrying and make a decision. Kicking off her flip-flops, Linda rubbed her feet against the cool tile floor. Decide. \u201cSo you think the newspaper will settle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely, darlin\u2019.\u201d Sprawled in a chair beside the couch, Marcus gave her a flashing smile. \u201cThey won\u2019t risk the negative publicity of a lawsuit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She pulled in a breath. Decision made. She tapped the name of the lawyer Marcus had recommended. \u201cI\u2019ll call the lawyer on Monday and get things started.\u201d She didn\u2019t want publicity any more than the paper did, but it wasn\u2019t right what Dwayne had done, and she wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d suffered. Her anger roused, remembering the tears her babies had shed. \u201cThank you, Marcus. I really wasn\u2019t sure how to handle any of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do wish I could take them on for you, but I\u2019m glad I could help.\u201d He rose and pulled her to her feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go get us some food.\u201d</p><p>He guided her through the kitchen door to a screen-caged pool-and-patio area. Linda took a deep breath of the warm, flower-scented air.</p><p>Beth and Gabi sat at the large marble-topped table. Beside Beth, Nolan was drinking a beer and watching a giant inflatable swan that floated in the pool.</p><p>Marcus pulled out a chair for Linda and seated himself beside Gabi. \u201cThe food looks good, sugar,\u201d he said. \u201cBest you eat up, since you\u2019ll need energy for tonight.\u201d</p><p>Gabi grinned. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d She glanced up at the sky where clouds were filming over the blue. \u201cI was hoping Master Z would open the Capture Gardens, but doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p><p>Nolan shook his head. \u201cForecast is for rain and wind starting around sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, damn.\u201d Gabi wrinkled her nose. \u201cSo what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>Marcus gave her long, slow stare. \u201cI might could figure something out that\u2019ll keep you occupied.\u201d The lazy power in his voice gave Linda a twinge\u2014made her wish for Sam.</p><p>\u201cI just bet you could.\u201d Gabi leaned against his arm and gave him a look of such trust that Linda\u2019s heart squeezed.</p><p>Marcus jerked his chin up at Nolan. \u201cYou\u2019re not working today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo point in being boss if I can\u2019t take a day off now and then,\u201d the rough contractor said, and his grin flashed briefly. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d have more time off than a fancy lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat just doesn\u2019t seem right, does it?\u201d Marcus snagged himself one of the sandwiches.</p><p>Beth frowned. \u201cHe took the time off because I have a landscaping job downtown, and he won\u2019t let me be there without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with that half-pint crew of yours.\u201d Nolan looked at Marcus. \u201cDan told me about those murdered prostitutes. Not comfortable with her being near downtown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably wise,\u201d Marcus agreed.</p><p>Linda frowned. The papers had reported something about the murderer. Sounded bad.</p><p>\u201cIs the district attorney\u2019s office getting any information?\u201d Nolan asked.</p><p>Marcus\u2019s jaw tightened. Linda had never seen him so grim. \u201cNot much evidence left behind. The murderer overpowers the victims and ties them up\u2014far too competently. Then he takes his time. The deaths are ugly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabi gave Marcus a concerned look, then scowled at Nolan. \u201cNo business at mealtime.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Marcus. \u201cGot a gag in the truck if you need one.\u201d</p><p>Marcus\u2019s expression cleared, and he grinned. \u201cLoan it to me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d Nolan ignored Gabi\u2019s glare and gave Linda an evaluating look. \u201cAnything happen last night?\u201d</p> <p>Why did he ask that? Had he seen her and Sam in the office room? Her cheeks turned warm, and then she realized he was talking about the spotter. Way to have your mind in the gutter. \u201cNo interesting voices,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice color you got there, darlin\u2019,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cGot yourself up to something else last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard Master Sam was in charge of the trainees last night.\u201d Beth pointed at Linda with a carrot stick. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a trainee now, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam did supervise us, yes,\u201d Linda said primly. Ignoring the laughter, she concentrated on choosing a sandwich. To her relief, the conversation moved on to discussing the high schoolers Beth hired part-time.</p><p>As she relaxed back into her chair, Gabi leaned over. \u201cAre you and Sam back together then?\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>Linda had a feeling she was glowing. After he\u2019d put her in his bed, he\u2019d been...well, Sam, but with a disconcerting new sweetness. It was as if trying to say the words was so difficult that he\u2019d wanted to show her instead.</p><p>When she let out a happy sigh, Gabi echoed it. \u201cI\u2019m glad for you...although he scares me a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Odd, but that had never been a problem. Well, except for when he deliberately got her anxious, and he was damn good at that. But even then, she felt safe with him.</p><p>\u201cWill you be at the Shadowlands tonight?\u201d Nolan asked her.</p><p>She lifted her chin, despite the chill that climbed up her spine and made her shiver. \u201cI\u2019ll be listening all night.\u201d</p><p>Sam stood beside his daughter, looking at the new stable.</p> <p>\u201cLooks good,\u201d Nicole said, hands in her jeans pockets. \u201cWill you breed Galadriel this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Sam glanced down at his girl. Prettiest sight in the world. Smart and sweet and talented. Z\u2019s words came back to him. \u201cHow about your daughter? Do you discuss your worries about the farm? Or tell her what she means to you?\u201d</p><p>Linda needed those words. Did Nicole? \u201cYou doing all right in school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d she said. \u201cAll A\u2019s except for chemistry.\u201d She scowled. \u201cLike I\u2019m ever going to want to dump a bunch of chemicals together in my future career.\u201d</p><p>Sam grinned, then tried a harder question. \u201cDo you ever miss your mom?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a startled look and bent to pet Connagher. After a second of sending the dog into happy wiggles, she answered, head still bent. \u201cKinda. Not her. Not how she is. But I wish...I wish she\u2019d been... I wish I\u2019d had a mom. She never was.\u201d</p><p>He ached for the sadness in her voice. Felt like hell that he hadn\u2019t done a better job, hadn\u2019t been able to divorce the woman and get sole custody much, much earlier. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and started to walk, his girl\u2019s usual response to being upset. Walk somewhere\u2014anywhere. When she was a teen, she\u2019d disappear completely. One of the reasons he\u2019d trained Conn to find her.</p> <p>He fell into step as she headed for the pond.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. Hell, you did a lot\u2014more than I realized\u2014at keeping her from messing up my life.\u201d She kicked some gravel into the bushes. \u201cSome of my friends had it worse. Like if your mom does drugs, but your dad isn\u2019t there to defend you. You were always there, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>He felt some of the tightness in his shoulders ease. He hadn\u2019t totally messed up. He had a momentary thought of how easily Linda would take to mothering his girl; she wouldn\u2019t even know she was doing it. Caring was just part of who his woman was.</p><p>His woman. Yeah.</p><p>But he had his own battles still to fight, and damn, it came hard. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Nicole.\u201d</p><p>The startled glance she gave him sent his gut to clenching. Yeah, he\u2019d screwed up badly, that she hadn\u2019t heard that from him before. The path was before him. Did he have the guts to continue?</p><p>\u201cGot out of the habit of saying anything,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She gave him an understanding nod. \u201cMother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d The words stuck in his throat again. Too many times his ex had begged for him to say he loved her. He\u2019d done so at first but had stopped when the words were such a lie that he couldn\u2019t force them out. Z had been right, damn him.</p><p>But Sam wasn\u2019t a coward. \u201cLove you, baby.\u201d The words came out rough.</p><p>The way she threw herself in his arms said she\u2019d understood them anyway.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Linda walked through the Shadowlands feeling as if she\u2019d entered a Halloween horror house. Every nerve jangled in fear that something would jump out at her.</p><p>The Feds weren\u2019t present. Cullen said the FBI agents had flown to New York. One of the Harvest Association\u2019s \u201cwarehouses\u201d had been found.</p><p>Even worse, Sam wasn\u2019t there to relieve her fears. Master Z had inspected the trainees for him and said he had problems at the farm. She hadn\u2019t realized how much safer she\u2019d felt with him around. Tonight she felt far, far too alone.</p><p>Her head tilted at the snap of a whip. Due to the storm warnings, the attendance was down. Master Z had given the Doms a treat and rearranged equipment to clear two huge spaces for the whip aficionados.</p><p>In a roped-off area, Raoul was using a long single-tail on Kim. Having seen the damage a whip could inflict, Linda could only stare as the end flicked lightly over Kim\u2019s back, over and over, never leaving a mark.</p><p>Kim was giggling so hard that her Master snorted, then made the whip crack over his head before swirling it back to snap on Kim\u2019s butt. This time it was hard enough to make her jump. And giggle some more.</p><p>Linda shook her head. Who would have thought the ex-slave would have fun when her Master used a whip? The cracking sound still made Linda freeze.</p><p>Beth came up beside Linda and wrapped an arm around her waist. \u201cHe never goes much harder than that, at least not with the whip,\u201d she whispered. \u201cKim enjoys a sexy flogging and even a paddle, but not the whip. He gave her a few stripes when he collared her, and it was so beautiful.\u201d Beth sighed. \u201cShe proved she trusted him to give her pain, that their relationship and her submission meant enough that she\u2019d risk her worst fears. He proved to her he could hurt her without going crazy and slicing her to pieces.\u201d</p><p>Linda realized Jessica was on her other side. \u201cYeah. Raoul loves playing with that whip. The first few times, Kim was stiff and scared, but...look at her. She\u2019s going to earn herself a few lines just because she won\u2019t shut up.\u201d</p><p>Raoul walked over and redid the ankle straps, widening Kim\u2019s legs. She couldn\u2019t wiggle anymore, and her pussy was...awfully exposed.</p><p>Linda bit her lip, remembering how Sam had caned her, moving up her inner thigh to hit her labia. What would Raoul do? \u201cIs he going to get mad at her?\u201d</p><p>Jessica shook her head. \u201cWatch.\u201d</p><p>Kim sassed him again. Linda realized he\u2019d moved so Kim couldn\u2019t see his flashing grin, and his stern voice didn\u2019t convey his amusement. \u201cChiquita, you are begging me for some pain, yes?\u201d</p><p>Raoul had a great voice, Linda thought. Smooth and deep and with that tiny accent.</p><p>But she preferred gravel. Harsh with an edge of mean sometimes.</p><p>Raoul\u2019s next lash made Kim squeak but left only a tiny pink mark.</p><p>\u201cDamn, he\u2019s good,\u201d Linda whispered.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2019s Sam.\u201d Beth squeezed her hand. \u201cHe and Raoul were showing off out at Cullen\u2019s once. I couldn\u2019t figure out which one was better.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI still don\u2019t like whips.\u201d</p><p>Linda shivered, remembering the first time Sam had whipped her. It had been at the auction with some triangular leather thing called a dragon\u2019s tongue. He\u2019d sure known what he was doing with that. Then again, he also seemed just fine with big and little canes. And his hand. Linda swallowed, feeling heat wash through her. Darn the man, just thinking about him got her all hot and bothered.</p><p>As a gust of wind rattled the windows, rain hit the glass panes like a drumroll. The storm was picking up.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to drive in this stuff.\u201d Jessica glanced at Linda. \u201cZ\u2019s going to keep the place open all night and let people sleep in the second-floor rooms if they want. But if...ah...you don\u2019t want company, you can use our guest bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Company. Linda\u2019s lips curved. She kind of liked that room they\u2019d used on the second floor so long ago. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d You got it bad, girl. \u201cWhere\u2019s your man?\u201d she asked Beth.</p><p>Beth turned toward the bar. Although Nolan was talking with Cullen, his gaze never left Beth for more than a second.</p><p>\u201cHe really keeps an eye on you.\u201d</p><p>Beth grinned. \u201cHe says I disappeared on him once and it\u2019s not going to happen again.\u201d She deepened her voice. \u201c\u2018Not on my watch.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSheesh, I\u2019m surprised he let you come.\u201d</p><p>Beth glanced at Jessica. \u201cAll the Masters showed up tonight. Because.\u201d</p><p>Because of Linda and her hunt. Some of her fear ebbed.</p><p>Jessica put her arm around Linda. \u201cWe\u2019re here for you too.\u201d</p><p>When Linda grinned\u2014the little blonde was all of five feet two and didn\u2019t look as if she could down a fly\u2014Jessica sniffed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to attack anyone. Our job is just to keep an eye on you. The guys can\u2019t follow you around, but no one notices us subs.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cThank you,\u201d Linda whispered, warmth spreading through her. She glanced over at the bar, caught the bartender\u2019s frown, and winced. \u201cI need to get to work. Master Cullen looks like he\u2019s going to have a hot-guy hissy fit.\u201d</p><p>To the sound of laughter, Linda headed for her assigned area.</p><p>As time went on, she checked on drinks and took orders and listened. Nothing. Nothing. And more nothing.</p><p>Exasperated, she returned to the bar with her drink orders, then had to wait for Cullen.</p><p>The giant bartender was whistling along with the music as he poured a glass of wine for a Domme. Finally he wandered down to her. \u201cGot some orders for me, pet?\u201d he asked, leaning a forearm on the bar top.</p><p>She handed over her tickets. Some of the trainees could remember who ordered what, but she sure wasn\u2019t one of them. Old age, maybe, only\u2014she huffed a laugh\u2014she\u2019d never had a good memory.</p><p>Cullen flipped through the notes and turned toward his submissive. \u201cAndrea.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t notice. Dressed in a catsuit that had more parts missing than were present, with cute white ears and a long white tail, Andrea remained intent on the beer she was drawing.</p><p>Cullen snorted, then leaned over and grabbed her tail.</p><p>Linda winced when she realized the tail wasn\u2019t attached to the costume, but to a butt plug instead.</p><p>Using the tail as a leash, Cullen pulled his submissive backward. Grinning at the spatter of Spanish profanity from her, he said, \u201cIf that plug comes out, love, I\u2019ll use a bigger one.\u201d</p><p>Linda\u2019s backside tightened in sympathy.</p><p>Andrea backpedaled more quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhen you finish that beer, set up the drinks for these, please, pet.\u201d Cullen handed some of the tickets to Andrea before looking back at Linda. \u201cRun along and take more orders. By the time you get back, we\u2019ll have these ready.\u201d</p><p>Clever Dom, keeping her moving. But as a roll of thunder went through the room, Linda frowned. Between the pounding music and the storm outside, she was having trouble hearing. She leaned forward. \u201cWhat did you say? The music\u2019s too loud. I can\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>Cullen hesitated, then even as he repeated himself, he nodded his understanding. Exchanging insults and jokes with the people seated around the bar, he moved toward where Master Z sat at the end.</p><p>Before Linda reached the back of the room, the music had changed to something quieter.</p><p>Damn neighbor shouldn\u2019t keep a bull if he couldn\u2019t keep him penned up. Still grumbling, Sam turned into the long driveway to the Shadowlands.</p> <p>Z had promised to watch over Linda when Sam called, but hell. Every minute that passed had increased the tightness in his gut.</p><p>And he was late for nothing. Capturing a horny bull in the rainy night had proven impossible. Looked like he\u2019d have a couple of calves he hadn\u2019t anticipated.</p><p>To top things off, he\u2019d had to bring Conn along to make sure the damn dog didn\u2019t try to run the bull off, which was how Sam had discovered the downed fence in the first place.</p><p>\u201cYou got a death wish, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked the muddy mutt curled up on a horse blanket beside him.</p><p>Conn gave a happy whine. Dog loved riding in the truck, and tonight he\u2019d contentedly nap in the cab until Sam had time to let him out for a run. From the sound of it, the storm wouldn\u2019t let up anytime soon, and Z would encourage the members to sack out in the upstairs rooms.</p><p>With luck\u2014and he\u2019d damn well make that luck\u2014he\u2019d talk Linda into one.</p><p>Maybe after Conn got a walk. The soft-hearted woman would undoubtedly want to come out and pet Conn. And she\u2019d get soaked.</p><p>A good Dom would order her to strip out of her wet clothes.</p><p>A good Dom would spank her if she hesitated.</p><p>A good sadist would redden her ass even if she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Sam parked his truck at the entrance\u2014hell with the parking lot. No one else would be arriving at this point. After a dash to the front, Sam pounded on the heavy door. Locked, as he figured. Ben opened the door and stepped back. \u201cZ said you\u2019d be along. Surprised you came out in this mess.\u201d</p><p>Like he\u2019d leave Linda here without him? \u201cSurprised anyone did.\u201d</p><p>Ben took his seat behind the desk. \u201cMost came before it started raining heavy.\u201d He frowned. \u201cThe lights have flickered a couple of times. We might end up without power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t that be fun?\u201d Sam shook his head, spattering the floor with drops. The emergency lighting wasn\u2019t bright enough for safe scening. Last time the power had gone out, everyone gave up and sat around the bar, Ben included. \u201cYou might end up with a drink tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d Ben\u2019s ugly face split in a grin. \u201cI\u2019m not into the action, but those corsets? Oh yeah.\u201d</p><p>Sam snorted in amusement, then entered the clubroom. Cullen and Andrea still manned the bar, although someone would relieve them soon so they could play the last few hours. A lot of the equipment had been shoved into the corners, so Z must have rearranged for some reason.</p><p>As Sam walked through the room, he assessed the happenings. A couple of new members were using the spiderweb; rough old Smith and his sub were on the nearest St. Andrew\u2019s cross; screams came from the bondage table area where electroplay was happening. Mistress Anne had not one, but two submissives at her feet, one man in a frilly apron with a lacy maid\u2019s cap. Would have been better if the guy had shaved first. The other had been locked into an elaborate cock ring and looked near blastoff.</p><p>Finally he spotted Linda.</p><p>He\u2019d told her last night the trainees could wear the costumes kept upstairs. Apparently, she had. She was damn fuckable in all brown leather, from the bustier that pushed up his favorite assets to the laced-up leather skirt that gave glimpses of garters. Her only jewelry was the trainee cuffs.</p><p>Guess he\u2019d better see about putting some ribbons on those cuffs, although he wasn\u2019t real happy about that thought.</p><p>When he reached her and turned her around, her eyes lit with relief. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you.\u201d She put her hand on his. \u201cI feel safer with you here.\u201d</p><p>The feeling of being needed was a heady one. \u201cThat the only reason?\u201d</p><p>She leaned into him, brushing her breasts over his chest, and murmured, \u201cPerhaps not.\u201d</p><p>Hell, yes. He pulled her in for a long, hot kiss and let his hands roam over her gorgeous curves. Her pussy was bare under the skirt, and he couldn\u2019t resist filling his palms with her soft, round ass cheeks. \u201cGirl,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She actually giggled. Putting her hands on each side of his face, she held him an inch from her lips and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re the only person I know who can say \u2018girl\u2019 and mean \u2018I love you and want to fuck you.\u2019\u201d She kissed him lightly. \u201cI love you, Sam.\u201d</p><p>Damn effective how she could turn a man\u2019s brain to mush. He smiled down into her pretty eyes. \u201cGet to work, trainee.\u201d</p><p>As she laughed and walked toward the bar, he turned to watch. Yeah, the view was even better from the rear. She\u2019d laced the skirt tight enough that it hugged her round ass. Be fun to inch it up to her waist so he could enjoy what was under.</p><p>Hell, now he had a hard-on to match the ones Anne\u2019s subs sported.</p><p>As he moved to where Cullen was mixing a drink, he heard the distinctive crack of a bullwhip. What the hell? \u201cWho\u2019s using a whip? And how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone who wants.\u201d Cullen grinned. \u201cZ roped off a couple of areas for single-tails.\u201d</p><p>Well, damn, the evening was looking up. Sam pulled his favorite bullwhip from his bag, adjusted the coil, and clipped it to his belt. \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Z hoped you\u2019d give a demo and lesson for the newer Doms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d His favorite kind of lessons. \u201cTrainees okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine.\u201d Cullen jerked his chin to the left. \u201cUzuri\u2019s staring at one of the new Doms.\u201d</p><p>Sam turned. He\u2019d seen the guy before. Multiethnic, like Uzuri\u2014maybe African-American and Asian. As a farmer, Sam had learned hybridizing made for stronger plants and animals. Made damned fine humans as well.</p><p>Uzuri didn\u2019t care about a man\u2019s race though; she just wanted a man who was gentle and dominant. But Sam had noticed the new Dom had a decided preference for darker women.</p><p>After taking the man\u2019s order, Uzuri walked back to the bar, hips swaying in a way that no man could mistake.</p><p>\u201cWant that one?\u201d Sam asked as she set her tray on the bar top.</p><p>Her eyes rounded. \u201cOh. I\u2014\u201d Her dark skin darkened further. Glancing over her shoulder, she let out a sigh. \u201cHe\u2019s even better looking than Denzel Washington. But he could have anyone here, so why would he want me?\u201d</p><p>Marcus had walked up in time to hear her words. He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty as peach pie, Uzuri. Sweet. Lively. Smart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAny Dom you\u2019ve been with requests you again, missy,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her face lit up. \u201cThey like me?\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s gaze met Marcus\u2019s. Yeah, they\u2019d be working on her sense of self-worth in the next few scenes. He\u2019d have to pick Doms who could handle that. He turned to study the new guy. Needed to talk to him.</p><p>\u201cBut, don\u2019t...don\u2019t bother that one. I still\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sam gave her a look that shut her up. The little mite had worked her way into his affections. He\u2019d damn well be sure she was safe. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to say about it. I\u2019ll be talking to him. See if he\u2019s worthy of you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. Then she shocked him spitless with a hug before dancing down to where Andrea was setting up drinks.</p><p>Sam heard Cullen\u2019s sub whisper, \u201cYou hugged Master Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy reputation\u2019s going to hell,\u201d Sam grumbled, giving Linda a quick check before turning away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best go beat on someone,\u201d Marcus agreed.</p><p>At the bar, the spotter watched the older redhead\u2014the ex-slave\u2014serve drinks. Yes, that was a slave he\u2019d like to break. To shove his cock in every orifice. Then his knife. Make her bleed.</p><p>Aaron shifted on the bar stool as he hardened, and his head began to buzz. It had been a couple of weeks since he\u2019d had any real fun. At one time, he\u2019d been able to wait months between kills, but then he\u2019d linked up with the Harvest Association. His price for targeting potential slaves had been to fuck the unpurchased ones. To kill the damaged ones.</p><p>Fine times.</p><p>Didn\u2019t look as if the redhead would be available anytime soon. He\u2019d heard Davies tell another Dom she was being evaluated and wouldn\u2019t be released to play with anyone for a week or so.</p><p>Even when she was, Aaron would have to be careful. Sam seemed to have a special interest in the trainee.</p><p>In the meantime...perhaps he\u2019d take a trip to Miami and pick up a whore. Indulgently, he watched the ex-slave as she picked up empties from a nearby coffee table, filling her small serving tray. She looked tense.</p><p>\u201cHey, Aaron, got a joke for you.\u201d</p><p>He turned his attention to the Doms standing nearby. He\u2019d played poker with two of them; a couple he didn\u2019t know. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>The man grinned and started, \u201cIn a mental institute, there\u2019s a sadist, a masochist, a murderer, a necrophile, a zoophile, and a pyromaniac. They\u2019re sitting on a bench, bored out of their gourds, looking for something to do.</p><p>\u201c\u2018How about having sex with a cat?\u2019 asks the zoophile.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Let\u2019s have sex with the cat and then torture it,\u2019 says the sadist.</p><p>\u201cThe murderer perks right up. \u2018Yeah. Let\u2019s have sex with the cat, torture it, and then kill it.\u2019</p><p>\u201c\u2018No, no, let\u2019s have sex with the cat, torture it, kill it, and then have sex with it again,\u2019 suggests the necrophile.</p><p>\u201cThe pyromaniac bounces up and down. \u2018Let\u2019s have sex with the cat, torture it, kill it, have sex with it again, and then burn it.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThey sit in silence. After a minute, the masochist speaks. \u2018Meow.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Along with the other Doms, Aaron roared with laughter, and the redhead stiffened as if someone had pinched her. As if she\u2019d heard something she recognized.</p><p>Fuck. Fuck! Aaron spun back to his drink. Before she could turn, he\u2019d set his elbow on the bar and was intently watching Cullen\u2019s big-titted submissive. Anyone looking would see he wasn\u2019t part of the group of Doms. A glance showed her attention had focused on the men who were still laughing.</p><p>His gut turned to lead. Maybe she hadn\u2019t seen him on the slave boat, but she\u2019d recognized his voice. His mouth thinned. The other night in the dungeon, had she heard him? Was that why Davies\u2019s scene had gone sour? No wonder she was tense tonight.</p><p>Was she just afraid, worried she\u2019d heard someone that sounded like a slaver, or was she actually trying to ID him? Fat chance. Too many men sounded alike.</p><p>He relaxed slightly. No, if she had been certain, Z would have lined up the entire membership for her. He wouldn\u2019t fuck around.</p><p>So Aaron had time. He could just go home. Not return until she was gone.</p><p>But if the slut told Z now and pointed to the Doms who\u2019d been laughing, one would remember Aaron had been part of the group. A similarity of voice might not be admissible in court, but an investigation would turn something up.</p><p>And a search of his apartment would recover the hanks of hair in his bedside table. Souvenirs to liven up his memories as he jacked off. He\u2019d watched enough CSI to know that even disposal and a thorough cleaning might not work.</p><p>He took a slow sip of his drink as his options decreased.</p><p>He\u2019d just have to make sure she never had a chance to hear him speak. No slut was going to disrupt his life. And he\u2019d have to do it tonight.</p><p>Tilting his head, he listened to the wind wailing around the building. Easy-peasy to sneak up on her in a rainy parking lot.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to play with her. Now he wouldn\u2019t have to wait.</p><p>God, it was him! The slaver\u2019s voice\u2014his laugh. Linda\u2019s stomach churned as if she\u2019d chugged a bottle of cheap tequila, and for a second she was afraid she\u2019d vomit. Taking shallow breaths, she forced her body to relax as she looked around. A couple of Doms sat at the bar, sipping their drinks. Not talking with anyone. Not them. Just behind them, four Doms were trading stories and laughing. So...one of the four. But which one?</p><p>A trickle of sweat ran down her back. What should she do now? She spotted Sam near the back, instructing a Dom on how to throw a single-tail. Master Z was monitoring a wax play scene that looked as if it wasn\u2019t going well.</p><p>Cullen was her best bet.</p><p>She made her way to the bar, smiling and trying to look carefree, finding a section of the bar that held no one close. She stood, heart hammering, waiting for Cullen.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, pet?\u201d His appraising gaze ran over her. He\u2019d obviously picked up her distress, although she could swear she looked normal.</p><p>\u201cJust a little stressed,\u201d she said discreetly. \u201cThere are so many people to keep track of.\u201d She let her gaze rest on the huddle of Doms.</p><p>He glanced at them, and she could see him memorizing their faces and names.</p><p>She let her gaze wander over the group, then past. Don\u2019t stare. Instead, she caught the gaze of a thin-lipped Dom sitting at the bar, sipping his drink.</p><p>With a smile, he tilted his head toward the St. Andrew\u2019s cross in an invitation to play. The idea of doing a scene right now\u2014knowing the slaver was in the room\u2014made her shudder. And...he was the Dom Sally said had slapped her.</p><p>After shaking her head to refuse, she turned to Cullen. \u201cAre my drinks ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the way.\u201d Cullen patted her hand, his huge one making hers disappear. \u201cYou can take a break, you know, love. Master Sam\u2019s strict, but he doesn\u2019t want you trainees dropping from exhaustion.\u201d</p><p>Strict. She wanted to be in Master Strict Sam\u2019s arms so badly she shivered. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She had to keep moving or she\u2019d flee. Had to figure out which of the men was the spotter. Had to keep him from hurting anyone else.</p><p>With a trayful of drinks, she headed toward the tables, almost tripping when the lights flickered, disappeared for a second, then resumed. After a slow breath, she was okay. She had only four to watch now, rather than the entire membership. If she circled around them, eventually she\u2019d figure out which man it was.</p><p>The next time she looked, she saw Cullen talking to Master Z. Her tension eased. They\u2019d watch those four Doms. Whichever one of them the slaver was, he wouldn\u2019t have a chance to escape. In fact, Z might just line them up for her to talk with. Her stomach went cold.</p><p>To her dismay, the group of Doms broke up. Two headed toward the back. One picked up a submissive, and the other asked someone to dance. Most of the stools around the bar were empty now. Probably people wanted to get a chance to play before the power went off.</p><p>Oh heavens, now what?</p><p>Sam was still in the bullwhip area. Even as he talked to the observers, he looked up and scanned the room. For her, she knew. His gaze hit her like a warm splash of rain, and then his eyes narrowed.</p><p>Needing him and his strength more badly than she could bear, she started toward him. A third of the way across the room, she froze as lightning crackled so close she heard the sizzle. The lights flickered and went off. Completely. At least three people screamed, and she heard a shout.</p><p>And then the battery-powered, dim emergency lighting came on, marking the doors and along the walls. It didn\u2019t help. She still felt as if she were going to jump out of her skin. Go to Sam.</p><p>As she skirted a couch, the thin-lipped man from the bar blocked her path. He was punching buttons on his cell phone, not watching where he was going.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said, looking up into his face.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNo. Excuse me, cunt.\u201d</p><p>The voice. His voice. God! As she tried to run, he jammed his cell phone against her side.</p><p>Agonizing pain blasted through her, spasming every muscle in her body, turning the world black.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>The rain hit Linda\u2019s face, cold and harsh. Hurt, hurt, hurt. She tried to move. Her muscles didn\u2019t work. Her head flopped. Her arms were pulled behind her back; her cuffs had been clipped together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blinking hard, she realized she was facedown...because she lay over someone\u2019s shoulder. And outside.</p><p>The slaver...the slaver had her. Everything in her wanted to panic, but her body wasn\u2019t hers. Limp and stupid.</p><p>How had he gotten outside with her? Past the guard?</p><p>As rain streamed down her face, she saw that the ground was grass, not concrete. They weren\u2019t in the parking lot. Not in front of the building. She managed to turn her head. Tall hedges, glimpses of a fence. Fountains. They were in the Capture Gardens that Master Z kept closed off except for special times. It was an alarmed fire door. And the alarm...wouldn\u2019t work with the power off. Oh God.</p> <p>Thunder rumbled across the sky, the flashes of lightning almost constant. Small solar lights lined the paths. She groaned, tried to move. Can\u2019t let him get away. Can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWaking up, bitch?\u201d The man rolled her off his shoulder, dumping her on the ground.</p><p>Everything jolted. Her head throbbed like someone had used a mallet on her skull.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re heavy.\u201d He rotated his shoulder, his breathing harsh.</p><p>She stared up at him. Not one of the four Doms. This man had been at the bar behind those Doms. Her tongue felt fat, sluggish, and her \u201cWhy?\u201d came out sounding like mush.</p> <p>\u201cSaw you listening. Figured it out.\u201d He smirked. \u201cI like redheads. Oh yeah. And older bitches. We\u2019ll have fun in a minute.\u201d He straightened and turned in a circle. \u201cThere\u2019s a gazebo back here somewhere if I can find it. Got time. With the place blacked out, nobody will notice you\u2019re missing until way too late for you. Such a pity.\u201d</p><p>A second later, she understood. Because he\u2019d taken her out the side door, no one would realize they were in the Gardens. Panic demolished her thoughts until she could only shake. She tried to move, screaming inside her head at her sluggish body. Try, try! Couldn\u2019t do anything. Closing her eyes against his smug expression, she fought her way free of the fear. Gripped her emotions and held them. She\u2019d lived through this before. Gotten free before.</p><p>She forced her hands open. Closed. Again. She had to get her body to work. Pain sizzled through her, too much like the lightning in the sky. The wind whipped the trees overhead. Rain hit her face like hammers, but cold spatter returned a bit of feeling to her body.</p><p>\u201cYeah. The gazebo must be that way.\u201d He yanked her to her feet, held her up when her knees buckled.</p><p>She tried to jerk away.</p><p>\u201cGive me trouble, and I\u2019ll zap you again,\u201d he said coldly. He patted the cell phone clipped on his belt. \u201cCute, huh? They make stun guns in all disguises these days.\u201d</p> <p>The cell phone was a stun gun. She closed her eyes, concentrated on breathing, and getting her strength back.</p><p>Humming under his breath, he half carried her down the grassy path, past shadowy nooks, arbors and fountains, a swing. A beautiful place and horrible, horrible right now.</p><p>\u201cGonna rip you to pieces, slut. You\u2019ll bleed so much even the rain won\u2019t wash it away.\u201d He squeezed her breast. \u201cCan\u2019t wait till Davies sees what I leave of you.\u201d</p><p>Tears of anger and fear joined the rain on her face. She couldn\u2019t bear this. Not again.</p><p>No! No panicking. They\u2019d look for her. Sam was there. He wouldn\u2019t give up. Neither would she.</p><p>When the lights went out, Sam ran toward where he\u2019d seen Linda.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d The high, hysterical scream stopped him. A woman in suspension was panicking and thrashing so hard her Dom couldn\u2019t cut her free. Sam grabbed her and held her still as the man snipped through the ropes. One rope. Two.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby, take it easy,\u201d the Dom was murmuring. Around the room, other submissives were being set loose. Yells and calls for assistance spread through the room.</p> <p>Sally appeared in the dim light. \u201cWhere\u2019s Linda? I can\u2019t find Linda!\u201d</p><p>Son of a bitch! He couldn\u2019t just drop the submissive in his arms. \u201cSally.\u201d</p><p>The sub stopped, panting and looking around with terrified eyes.</p><p>Fear knotted his gut, and he snapped out, \u201cFind Z and tell him, girl.\u201d</p><p>Sally ran.</p><p>\u201cLast one,\u201d the Dom said.</p><p>The ropes dropped off, and Sam took the weight of the submissive. As she cried, he set her onto a couch. Her Dom dropped down beside her.</p><p>Done. When he turned, he spotted Nolan in the shadowy light with Beth tucked under his arm.</p><p>Sam motioned him over. \u201cFind Linda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Nolan muttered, his expression darkening.</p><p>Sam headed for where he\u2019d last seen her. No one in that spot. No Linda in sight. Hell with this. He hauled in a breath. \u201cLinda! Answer me now!\u201d</p><p>The room quieted, the command in his voice shutting everyone down. No answer. \u201cLinda. Answer me!\u201d</p><p>Sharp glass seemed to fill his gut. Where the hell was she? He started for the front entrance.</p><p>Z appeared at his side, carrying a heavy-duty flashlight. He handed Sam another. \u201cCullen said she\u2019d pointed out four Doms, but they\u2019re all in the room. Ben says no one came out, and he won\u2019t let anyone leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the Masters searching.\u201d</p><p>A shout came across the room. Marcus\u2019s voice. \u201cRestrooms empty.\u201d</p><p>Raoul\u2019s voice. \u201cTheme rooms clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot upstairs,\u201d Dan yelled.</p><p>Cullen yelled, \u201cNot danceside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the back,\u201d Anne yelled.</p><p>\u201cHe got her out. Somehow.\u201d Sam considered. \u201cYour private exit to your yard is locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The only other way out would be\u2014\u201d Z turned toward the side of the room. The Capture Garden door stood slightly ajar.</p><p>\u201cHell. No power. No alarm.\u201d Sam\u2019s jaw clenched. The huge Gardens were designed for hide-and-seek games with hedges and hidden nooks. In the dark and rain, it could take hours to find her. If the spotter had her, she didn\u2019t have hours.</p><p>Conn was in the truck, which Sam had parked right in front. \u201cStart the search. I\u2019m getting my dog.\u201d</p><p>Linda couldn\u2019t stop shivering. Her skin was drenched. Her hair hung in cold tangles on her shoulders. She couldn\u2019t stand on her own, let alone run.</p><p>The slaver\u2014Aaron, he\u2019d said his name was\u2014dropped her onto a bench in the gazebo.</p><p>Her hope of rescue was sinking. A tall cedar fence marked the back wall of the garden. \u201cThey\u2019ll catch you. You should run while you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGonna do you first.\u201d He grinned. \u201cThen I\u2019ll cut your hair off for something to remember you by and toss your body over the fence.\u201d He tried to yank off her bustier but couldn\u2019t work the tiny wet hooks with his wet hands. When he pulled a hunting knife from the sheath at his hip, her breathing stopped.</p><p>God, please, no.</p><p>But he slipped it under the leather and sliced upward between her breasts. The bustier dropped open. \u201cMuch better.\u201d</p><p>His hands were on her, squeezing roughly. She kicked at him frantically, knocking him back. He grunted in pain, but her bare feet hadn\u2019t done enough damage.</p><p>Stepping forward, he slapped her legs aside, grabbed her throat. Then his head lifted. Running sounds. A dog baying. \u201cFuck, they\u2019re out here already.\u201d</p><p>She knew that dog. Conn was here. Exultation filled her. Scream. She pulled in a quick breath and\u2014</p><p>He grabbed her hair, and his knife pricked her throat. \u201cScream and you\u2019re just meat cooling in the rain.\u201d</p><p>She choked back the sound, her hands clenching. Here. I\u2019m here! Please...</p><p>\u201cToo damn fast. Were they watching you, slut?\u201d He slapped her cruelly, the pain sudden and startling, then yanked her to her feet. Before she could recover, the knife was back at her throat. He answered for himself. \u201cI knew you were listening. But you\u2019d already told Z, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He considered the fence, then shook his head as footsteps advanced directly toward them. \u201cToo late. Bet they have someone guarding the parking lot by now.\u201d</p><p>Hurry, Sam. Hurry.</p><p>Aaron stared down at her with cold eyes. \u201cGuess it\u2019s the hostage game. Don\u2019t fuck up or I\u2019ll slit your throat in front of them all.\u201d</p><p>He would anyway. She knew it, saw her death in his gaze. He turned as Conn appeared, the dog brought to a sudden halt by the leash Sam held. Z and Nolan were directly behind him. Others followed.</p><p>Her hope of being freed was dying fast, but oh, she wouldn\u2019t be left alone with this man. Gratitude for that mercy made her eyes water.</p><p>In the wet light from the nearby fountain, Sam\u2019s pale gaze fastened on her. Fury made his gaze almost glow. \u201cLet her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d The spotter gave a short laugh. \u201cBack off, way off, or I slit her throat and you watch her bleed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t that stupid.\u201d Z\u2019s mild voice belied the rigidity of his jaw. \u201cKilling her won\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe satisfying though.\u201d The knife pricked her skin.</p><p>She felt blood trickle down her throat, hot against the chilled skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to jail. I heard about the Overseer\u2014getting reamed like a cunt,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cEither I get away clean, or I take her with me before I die.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s growl and Conn\u2019s snarl sounded in the silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The guy laughed. \u201cI never liked you, Davies, but you\u2019ve got good taste in sluts. Now back off.\u201d The knife pricked her harder.</p><p>She gritted her teeth. He wouldn\u2019t get a noise from her. Wouldn\u2019t get anything. Never, ever again. She met Sam\u2019s gaze and spoke directly to him. \u201cI\u2019d rather die than let him take me. My choice. My body.\u201d Know that I mean this, my love.</p><p>Sam\u2019s face blanked of all expression.</p><p>\u201cShut that yap.\u201d Aaron put his hand over her face\u2014her nose and mouth. She couldn\u2019t breathe. As she struggled, Aaron yelled at Z, \u201cBack the fuck up. Now.\u201d</p> <p>Blackness danced in her head. But as the men retreated, almost disappearing in the darkness, Aaron removed his hand from her face.</p><p>Air. She heaved in a breath, another.</p><p>As Aaron dragged her beside him, she turned her head. Everything in her wanted one last look at her Sam. Just one.</p><p>At the edge of the clearing, Sam handed Conn\u2019s leash to Anne. As the Mistress dragged the dog away, Sam stood alone.</p><p>Linda looked at him. I love you. Regret swept over her, colder than the dying wind. The rain had stopped, but water dripped from the trees and palms. What might they have had together? Why had she let Sam retreat from her? Now those few days had been wasted, precious jewels of time tossed away.</p> <p>And her hope of more time with him was fading so, so quickly. Her lips tightened. If the slaver got her to the parking lot, then\u2014but only then\u2014she\u2019d give up. She\u2019d jam her neck on the knife herself. I\u2019m sorry, my babies. Sam. I hope you\u2019ll forgive me someday.</p><p>But never, never, never again would she be a slave.</p><p>SAM\u2019S RAGE HAD disappeared, driven down to a hard ball in his gut, waiting to explode. As his mind frantically turned over plan after plan, his heart slowed, his blood turned to ice.</p><p>Linda walked on Aaron\u2019s right, his right hand curled around her left upper arm, holding her in place. His left hand held the blade against the left side of her throat. The bastard was fully a head taller than Linda was.</p><p>There was no surefire plan. None. No time to get weapons, which Z undoubtedly had upstairs. Aaron had made it clear he was willing to die\u2014and kill Linda first.</p><p>Sam wanted to wait. Surely there\u2019d be a way to get her free that wouldn\u2019t risk her life. She just had to hang in there.</p> <p>\u201cMy body. My choice.\u201d She\u2019d spoken clearly. Bluntly. She\u2019d rather die.</p><p>He saw only one slim chance to free her. He pulled in a breath against rigid lungs. If his actions killed her...he\u2019d slaughter the bastard and follow. Damned if he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Once back in the shadows, Sam slipped over to Z. He\u2019d need space and darkness. But the approach to the mansion\u2019s side door was lit with solar lamps. No way to shut them off.</p><p>However, the lighting for the front of the Shadowlands was electrical. Without power, there were no lights.</p><p>Z\u2019s eyes were black in the dim lighting. \u201cIf he\u2019s willing to die, there\u2019s no good way to take him out before he kills her. We can try, but I doubt she\u2019d survive. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to take him just past the fence.\u201d Sam considered the areas of light and dark. \u201cYou make him use the side gate. Follow him. Noisy. Keep his attention on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Sam unsnapped the bullwhip from his belt.</p> <p>EVEN KNOWING HER cuffs were clipped together, Linda fought the restraints. She needed\u2014needed\u2014to push the knife away. With every step, she felt the cold metal scrape against the left side of her neck.</p><p>She\u2019d lunged to the side to escape his hold, but his hand was big and his grip on her arm was unbreakable. He\u2019d cut her again, whether by accident or anger, and now his grip squeezed her upper arm so tightly the flesh grated against her bone.</p><p>Helpless. Her jaw clenched against the screams desperate to escape.</p><p>But she\u2019d fight until her options were gone. She let her weight sag and dragged her feet to make the slaver work for every inch of ground.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to die. She felt the tremor of the knife on her neck. But she\u2019d heard the spiteful resolve in his voice. He\u2019d kill them both if the men trapped him.</p><p>Trembling shook her body. I don\u2019t want to die either. But she would. Oh yes. Even knowing what her death would do to Sam. He\u2019d forgive her. Eventually. The slaver had no intentions of letting her go free; the only question would be when she\u2019d die.</p><p>And she\u2019d be the one to decide when. She wouldn\u2019t get into a car with him. If he made it to the parking lot... Well, at that point, she\u2019d make sure the only body he\u2019d get would be a dead one.</p><p>\u201cFucking cunt, move your legs.\u201d He gripped her upper arm, dragging her forward. The knife never moved from her throat. Her lips twisted in a bitter grimace. Maybe he\u2019d trip and kill her by accident.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll open the side gate for you,\u201d Master Z\u2019s voice came from behind as they neared the mansion.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Aaron grunted, turning away from the door into the clubroom.</p><p>Z moved ahead and held the tall wooden gate open.</p><p>As Aaron pulled Linda through, leaving the solar lights in the Capture Gardens behind, darkness surrounded them. The wrought-iron sconces along the building walls had gone out with the power.</p><p>Footsteps sounded from behind. The Masters hadn\u2019t stayed back but were following. Noisily. Nolan\u2019s rough curses. Anne\u2019s whispered threats. But no gravelly voice. Wanting one last glimpse of Sam more than she wanted breath, Linda tried to turn her head.</p><p>Aaron yanked her closer. \u201cYou fucking slut, keep your\u2014\u201d</p><p>She heard a whistling sound, then a snap. Hot wetness splattered across her face and shoulders. The grip on her arm loosened.</p><p>Now, now, now. She threw herself sideways, away from the blade.</p><p>Unable to catch herself, she landed heavily on her shoulder and frantically rolled.</p><p>Over the pounding of her pulse, she heard choking and screaming, the sounds so ghastly that chills raced over her skin.</p><p>She was grabbed, and she screamed. Pulled and kicked and fought the ruthless grip. \u201cNo. Not again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy there, missy.\u201d</p><p>At the growl in her ear, she froze. Sam. His hands were on her. He had her. Panting and shaking, she went limp.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms, holding her painfully tight, his face against her hair. His voice a low rumble of curses. \u201cThat cock-sucking fuckheaded piece of shit. I\u2019m going to fucking destroy the goddamn motherfucking son of a whore.\u201d</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cYou goddamned scared the shit out of me, girl.\u201d And he actually gave her a shake before yanking her into his arms again. His cheek rested against the top of her head as his barely audible chant continued: \u201cI\u2019ll rip the fucking asshole\u2019s dick off and stuff it down his douche-bag throat. Take my whip and cornhole the bastard peckerheaded fuckwad till his ass whistles \u2018The Star-Spangled Banner.\u2019 Then I\u2019ll break the dried-up piece of jackwad\u2019s leg off and shove it up his ass.\u201d After a minute, Linda untangled the curses and threats, all given in a voice that sounded like a badly tuned gravel truck\u2014the most beautiful sound she\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>A man was screaming, close...Aaron. She recognized voices. The Masters were there, she thought, the number increasing as others streamed out of the mansion.</p><p>Flashlights flickered. Someone retched.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s barely got a face left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet an ambulance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019ve never seen so much blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me not to piss Davies off.\u201d</p><p>Aaron screeched louder.</p><p>Marcus\u2019s low laugh. \u201cAnne, I do believe that\u2019s overkill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fucking asshole doesn\u2019t deserve to keep those balls.\u201d Anne\u2019s hard voice. \u201cWho\u2019s got cuffs?\u201d</p><p>Over. It was over.</p><p>Sam\u2019s arms didn\u2019t loosen.</p><p>She didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d stay right there for an eternity.</p><p>Cullen detached himself from the crowd. He smacked Sam on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re going to break your woman.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s growl sounded as if it came from two directions. Conn stood behind the big Dom, fangs exposed.</p><p>Without moving, Cullen said, \u201cDavies. Call off your damn hound so I can get her hands free.\u201d</p><p>The arms around Linda loosened slightly as Sam\u2019s chest moved with a long inhalation. \u201cConn. Stand down.\u201d</p><p>The dog skirted Cullen and lunged into Linda\u2019s lap, whining his worry. Wet fur. Warm, solid body.</p><p>Master Z appeared. He bent, shining a light so Cullen could see what he was doing. The cuffs were unclipped.</p><p>As the men moved her arms forward, her shoulders grated like rusty metal hinges. But she was free. And alive. Her body caught up suddenly, and she started shuddering so hard her bones shook. Everything hurt. Grabbing Sam\u2019s shirt, she burrowed, trying to get closer. Closer.</p><p>Master Z moved to her side and set a hand on her arm. \u201cRaise your chin, little one.\u201d</p><p>Cheek against Sam\u2019s chest, hands fisting his shirt, she couldn\u2019t make herself obey.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Sam muttered. \u201cAnne, take Conn for me again.\u201d</p><p>As the dog was pulled away, Sam tried to shift her.</p><p>Ignoring the grinding complaint of her shoulders, Linda wrapped her arms around him. Never, ever going to let him go.</p><p>Master Z gave a huff of exasperation. \u201cThat didn\u2019t help. Samuel, we need to see what that knife did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The chest under her cheek turned rigid, and a merciless grip on her arms moved her back.</p><p>More flashlights beamed down on them.</p><p>Sam\u2019s eyes were pure ice in the increasing light. \u201cLet\u2019s see, girl.\u201d The anger in his voice reverberated like the bass turned up as he cupped her chin and lifted.</p><p>The movement pulled at the burning lines across her neck.</p> <p>Z touched her neck, then smiled. \u201cAll superficial. You did well, Samuel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too old for this goddamned active-duty crap.\u201d Sam put an arm under her knees and lifted her. \u201cLet\u2019s get you bandaged, baby.\u201d</p><p>Above the Shadowlands in Z\u2019s third-floor home, Sam held Linda in his arms, where she the hell belonged, he thought. Her face remained as white as the fluffy blanket he\u2019d wrapped around her. Her hair held the only color, much like the brightness she\u2019d brought into his life.</p><p>He\u2019d almost lost her. Leaning against the arm of the couch, he pulled her closer. Her legs had tangled with his; her cheek rested against his chest. Her breath created a warm spot on his shoulder, a tactile proof she was alive.</p><p>So damn close.</p> <p>Aaron could have slit her throat. Although the cops had been shocked at what the bullwhip had done to Aaron\u2019s face, Sam had been\u2014was still\u2014shaking at how close the bastard had come to killing her.</p><p>And she wouldn\u2019t have been the first. When she\u2019d told the cops that Aaron had planned to cut off her hair, they\u2019d gone quiet. A call had gone out.</p><p>A while later, Marcus and Dan had come upstairs to share what the detectives found at Aaron\u2019s apartment. Mementos from the women he\u2019d raped and killed.</p><p>She stirred as if detecting his thoughts, then pushed back to look up at him. The bruising on her face made him want to find the bastard and deal out more punishment. \u201cDid I remember to say thank you?\u201d she asked, her dark brown eyes the color of the chocolate she liked so well. He\u2019d need to stock up.</p><p>\u201cFor what, baby?\u201d He brushed his hand over her hair.</p><p>\u201cThe rescue.\u201d She pulled in a breath. \u201cFor letting the choice be mine.\u201d</p> <p>The fabric of the blanket was soft under his fingers as he squeezed her shoulder. Too thin. She\u2019d lost weight in the last week. Since he\u2019d been such an ass. \u201cThe choice is always yours.\u201d He closed his eyes for a second. \u201cI could have got you killed.\u201d He foresaw having nightmares for years about that knife against her throat, the dark trickle of blood on her pale neck.</p><p>She flattened her palm on his cheek. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. And I wouldn\u2019t have let him take me. I wasn\u2019t going to go farther than the parking lot.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d known, goddammit. How could so much courage come packed in someone so soft and sweet? He kissed the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cI wondered...\u201d Her forehead furrowed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wrap the whip around his arm and pull the knife away?\u201d</p><p>The cops had asked the same question. Seemed they all watched too many Indiana Jones movies.</p><p>Sam picked up her arm and bent it, duplicating the position in which Aaron had held the knife. \u201cNeed space around the target to wrap a whip. And got to wrap the leather a couple times so it will hold when I pull.\u201d He used a corner of the blanket to make a few turns around her wrist, then opened it to show her the length. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough room. The tail would have hit your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cYou knew what you\u2019d do to his...face when you hit him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He tucked the blanket back over her shoulder, hating that she\u2019d gone paler. He\u2019d hoped she wouldn\u2019t see Aaron, but of course, she\u2019d looked. \u201cIn a scene, a single-tail is used...lightly...even when you intend to draw some blood. With Aaron, I didn\u2019t hold back.\u201d</p> <p>Her shiver reminded him that her friend, Holly, had been whipped to death.</p><p>\u201cIt was a bad gamble, baby. Get surprised by a punch to the face and you\u2019re stunned. Paralyzed for a split second. Only a second. But when the whip hit him, it wouldn\u2019t have worked if you hadn\u2019t jumped away.\u201d</p><p>Brave, brave woman.</p><p>She squeezed his hand and looked at him in a way that made his heart melt. \u201cThank you for hearing me. And for saving my life.\u201d When she took her hand away, he missed her warmth. \u201cI\u2019d better get moving. Will you walk me to my car?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched hard enough to bust his molars. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam. We can\u2019t sit in Master Z\u2019s living room all night. It\u2019s time to go. I can drive now.\u201d</p><p>And when she had a belated reaction on the road? When she drove into a ditch, leaving him alone? No damned way. \u201cI\u2019ll drive. And you\u2019ll come home with me.\u201d</p><p>Her big eyes widened. Her chin came up. When he saw the bandage, a small circle of red staining the center, his throat loosened so more words came forth. \u201cI want you in my house. Living with me. In my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d The words came easier each time. He curled her closer into him. She was so damned precious. Fragile and strong.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t answer, he had an uncomfortable reminder of how his silence must have hurt her. He gave her an impatient jostle. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to say it back, girl. There are rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRules?\u201d Her lips tipped up. \u201cMy sergeant.\u201d Her eyes warmed in the way he\u2019d needed to see, and she whispered, \u201cI love you, Sam. I really, really do.\u201d</p><p>As he buried his face in her hair, he swore to himself that she\u2019d hear the words from him every single damned day.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Two weeks later</p><p>As Linda checked the chicken in the slow cooker for after-church dinner, she smiled at the sound of the children\u2019s laughter coming from the dining area.</p><p>Nicole was teasing Charles about continuing with his cafeteria job despite the settlement from the newspaper.</p><p>\u201cI decided to save the money. It\u2019s not that bad, putting a few hours in,\u201d answered Charles.</p><p>Brenna snickered. \u201cAnd you get all the girls lined up in a row to flirt with, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery true.\u201d</p><p>Charles. Linda laughed under her breath. Her son definitely had a way about him. Girls had flocked to him even in kindergarten.</p><p>As an arm wrapped around her waist, she heard Sam\u2019s gruff morning voice. \u201cGood thing I have farm chores, missy, or your cooking would give me a big gut.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, turning in his embrace to receive her kiss. \u201cGood morning. The kids got here early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d He really did growl like her neighbor\u2019s dog, Bruno, although a corner of his mouth tipped up, showing he was pleased.</p><p>Linda tilted her head at noise from outside. \u201cIs that a car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like.\u201d His brows drew together. \u201cConstruction\u2019s done. Kids are here. No deliveries are scheduled.\u201d</p><p>Linda and the children followed him out to the front porch.</p><p>A car drew to a stop in the circular drive in front of the house. Blue paint, scraped and faded, a headlight shattered, the passenger door bashed in. A stick-figure blonde emerged.</p><p>\u201cNancy,\u201d Sam muttered.</p><p>That was Sam\u2019s ex? Linda turned to look at Sam. His expression was icy cold...growing more remote by the second. Fear washed over Linda. No. Not again. She took a step toward him.</p><p>\u201cMother.\u201d Nicole sounded as if she was winded.</p><p>Seeing the fear and anger and sheer misery on Nicole\u2019s face, Linda felt fury boiling in her veins. No child should look like that. Ever. Last Sunday, the children had flipped through Nicole\u2019s baby book. A true mess. Apparently Sam had slapped the pictures in with no attempt at artistry. But he\u2019d tried.</p><p>Far too many of the pictures showed a girl with haunted eyes\u2014the same look as she had in her eyes now.</p><p>No more. This stopped right now.</p><p>Sam started toward the steps.</p><p>Linda slapped a hand to his chest, halting him. \u201cStay here. I\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d She glanced at her son. \u201cCharles, keep them here.\u201d</p><p>As she ran down the steps, she heard Sam\u2019s rough, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cDon\u2019t mess with Mom when she gets pissed off. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>Linda stalked across the drive.</p><p>The blonde scowled, then attempted a smile. \u201cHey. I\u2019m here to see Sam. Tell him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Linda crossed her arms over her chest. Tweaker skinny, teeth rotten, dyed-blonde hair with roots showing, attired in skanky clothing. Poor Nicole. \u201cI live here now, Nancy. You\u2019ll deal with me\u2014for about thirty seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Shock and anger twisted Nancy\u2019s face. She had sweat on her forehead. Hands trembling.</p><p>Yes, she was here to hit Sam up for money. Again. \u201cListen up,\u201d Linda said sharply. \u201cThis is my family now, and you\u2019ve screwed up their lives enough. Sam might not have the heart to call the cops, but I certainly will. Leave now. Don\u2019t come back. Or I\u2019ll dump your ass in jail and press charges.\u201d She gave the woman a merciless stare. \u201cYou can go through withdrawal behind bars.\u201d</p><p>SAM STARED DOWN at the two women. \u201cWhat the hell is she saying?\u201d</p><p>Facing him as one unit, Charles and Brenna blocked the steps. He wasn\u2019t quite ready to knock Linda\u2019s children on their asses. But letting his woman confront his ex... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To his surprise, Nancy wilted under whatever Linda was saying.</p><p>Nicole slid up against his side. \u201cShe\u2019s taking on Mother?\u201d</p><p>As Sam put an arm around his daughter, Brenna glanced over her shoulder at the confrontation, then grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s scary when she goes into Medusa Mama mode.\u201d She grinned at her brother. \u201cRemember how the principal begged her forgiveness for giving a detention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr how she took on that old fart down the block who perved on the kids.\u201d Charles glanced at Sam. \u201cAn \u2018I got candy for you, little girl\u2019 jerk. He spoke to Brenna once, Mom had a \u2018chat\u2019 with him, and he put his house up for sale the next day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut she\u2019s so sweet,\u201d Nicole whispered. \u201cMother will hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sam stared as Nancy retreated from Linda so fast her back banged into her car. She jumped in and slammed the door.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s sweet right up to the point where you mess with her kids. Then, look out. Everyone in Foggy Shores knows that.\u201d Brenna took Nicole\u2019s hand. \u201cFrom that smackdown, I\u2019d say you just got adopted.\u201d</p><p>Nicole\u2019s eyes filled with tears.</p><p>As Sam pulled her closer, the ice of frustrated anger that had filled his veins melted, and warmth spread from his heart outward. He could only watch as Nancy drove...away.</p> <p>Hands on hips, Linda waited until the car peeled through the gate. She gave a short nod\u2014task done\u2014and walked back to the porch.</p><p>With big grins, her children parted to let her through.</p><p>She patted their arms. \u201cThank you, darlings.\u201d Then without speaking, she took Nicole from Sam and wrapped her in a Linda hug, probably the warmest, most caring embrace found on the planet.</p><p>Sam\u2019s eyes burned, and he looked away.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, you can\u2019t help but feel bad, I know,\u201d Linda murmured to his girl. \u201cI\u2019ve lost friends to drugs. It\u2019s like cancer. Some can fight back and win. Others\u2014for whatever reason\u2014can\u2019t. If she ever turns her life around, then you can see what kind of a person she really is. Until then, I hope you\u2019ll let me stand in for her.\u201d</p><p>When Nicole burst into tears, Sam closed his eyes, hearing the release of years of misery. Of wanting a mother and not having one.</p> <p>He jerked his head at Brenna and Charles and took them to the stables to introduce them to farm chores. They might as well get used to helping, since their mother wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>A while later, he released the two kids to play with Conn while he went to the chicken coop. Hard workers, those two. The boy had talked about majoring in criminology\u2014apparently his goal in life had changed over the past year. Well, when he graduated, there were enough Masters in the various law enforcement areas to give him a hand up.</p><p>Sam shook his head. When Kouros and Buchanan had driven out to the farm to talk with Linda, they\u2019d obviously felt guilty. Although she\u2019d tried to reassure them, Kouros had still looked haunted when they left. A rough occupation. Maybe Charles should switch his major to agriculture.</p><p>Broken fences, unexpected droughts, and foaling were a hell of a lot easier on a man.</p><p>Guilt wasn\u2019t confined to cops either. When Sally had visited, she\u2019d apologized over and over for suggesting that Linda should be a trainee.</p><p>As Sam finished filling the feeders, he heard Linda and his daughter coming toward the chicken coop.</p><p>Sounded as if Nicole had returned to normal. She was explaining how she\u2019d learned the facts of life. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Daddy could turn so red.\u201d She grinned at Sam as she walked into the barn. Her face was puffy from crying, but her eyes were clear. Happy. His girl would be fine.</p> <p>He sent a look of gratitude to Linda.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind seeing him turn red,\u201d Linda said. \u201cBut did he manage to explain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cOne of his friends\u2014Anne\u2014took me out for a slushie and told me all about that stuff.\u201d Nicole grinned. \u201cWithout blushing once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne? The Anne I know?\u201d From the horrified expression on Linda\u2019s face, she\u2019d met Mistress Anne.</p><p>He gave her a bland look. \u201cShe knows male anatomy. Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoooh.\u201d Her eyes sparked. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>As silence filled the house, Sam carried dishes to the kitchen with Conn trailing eagerly after him. Linda was spoiling the hound, slipping him tidbits. Hard to call her on it, since Nicole had been doing the same for years.</p><p>A few minutes before, they\u2019d sent the children off, back to their college. Their dinner had been late, but he had to admit, he enjoyed having them all at the table.</p><p>Brenna loved to argue but had a lively sense of humor to go with it, and her laughter was as full-bodied as her mother\u2019s.</p><p>Charles had a protective streak that rivaled Sam\u2019s. When Nicole had mentioned walking home from the library in the dark, the boy had scolded her about safety before Sam could get a word in.</p><p>Linda had done well with her children. Their idiotic teenager brains might have led them to give her grief, but they were even faster with their affection, with hugs and love you\u2019s.</p><p>Like a dry plant, Nicole had soaked it up.</p><p>Sam had as well. Linda wanted to continue her family\u2019s traditional after-church dinners. The idea suited him to a tee.</p><p>As he entered the kitchen, Linda was singing the Beatles\u2019 bouncy \u201cWhen I\u2019m Sixty-Four\u201d as she put some oranges in a colorful basket on the counter. He shook his head. Nothing kept his woman down for long.</p><p>Coming up behind her, he squeezed her shoulder. \u201cNot sure how to thank you. For Nicole. And Nancy.\u201d</p><p>Her dimple appeared. \u201cYou could give me more of what I had last night. I\u2019m a masochist, you know.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed on her hopeful face. He\u2019d created a monster. Last night, after using a cane on her, he\u2019d fucked her until around two a.m.</p><p>After a second of thought, he smiled slowly. \u201cBe my pleasure. Before you leave, find your favorite toy. Use lube, insert it, wear it this afternoon while you\u2019re gone. You\u2019ll be stretched and ready for me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Delightful anxiety bloomed in her eyes. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Maybe he\u2019d haul her to bed early.</p><p>Linda picked up a piece of bacon. \u201cGot a treat for you, Conn.\u201d She bent to give it to the dog and winced.</p><p>Sam grinned. \u201cSomeone have a sore ass today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a sadist. And yes, you left bruises.\u201d</p><p>He knew he had. Earlier in the bathroom, she had been examining a purple spot on her bottom with the half-fascinated, half-pleased look of many submissive-masochists.</p><p>He ran his finger down her pretty cheek. \u201cI like leaving marks here and there.\u201d Liked knowing she had a few sore spots to remind her of him. A kind of branding.</p><p>Unable to resist, he wrapped an arm tightly around her waist and squeezed her soft ass.</p><p>She eeped, then groaned as he squeezed harder. Hurting her so nicely. She sagged against him. \u201cDamn you.\u201d Her pupils had dilated, and pink swept into her cheeks. \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArouse you? It\u2019s not hard.\u201d He leaned in and pinned her against the counter with his weight. Her hair had grown long enough for him to get a good grip, and he tugged her head back. After kissing up her neck, he nipped her earlobe, enjoying her sharp inhalation at the bite of pain.</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d Running his hand down her front, he explored the V between her legs, then traced over her clit. He could feel it harden despite her tight jeans. And then he let her go.</p><p>When she swayed toward him, he took a step back.</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cYou\u2019re stopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to leave for work in a few minutes, remember? You said you\u2019re the only person there this afternoon.\u201d And now she could work behind the counter while aching for him.</p><p>Her lower lip poked out in a sweet pout. \u201cYou want me to suffer all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He pressed his erection against her soft stomach. Even sadists had to hurt sometimes. \u201cWe both will. And once you\u2019re home, I\u2019m going to take your cunt first and then your pretty ass. Yep. I\u2019ll fuck you senseless.\u201d He pushed against her body again and smiled down into her big brown eyes. \u201cBefore that, I\u2019ll put you over my knee and turn your ass red.\u201d The welts\u2014and anal plug\u2014should make that even more fun. Maybe they\u2019d work on that begging problem she had.</p><p>Despite the glare she gave him, her voice came out husky with arousal. \u201cThanks, Master Sadist. That really will make my day easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, missy.\u201d Then he leaned forward and gave her the words that erased the glare from her face, the words that came easier every time he said them. \u201cI love you, Linda.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
