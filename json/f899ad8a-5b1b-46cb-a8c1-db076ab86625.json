The mildly warm day and clear skies could change in a helluva hurry on the high plains of Wyoming and she shivered at an odd sense of foreboding.</p><p>Each steady clip brought the man closer, but she couldn\u2019t see his face. A long sheepskin coat brushed the thighs of faded Wranglers, drawing attention to the championship belt buckle centered between trim hips. Leather gloves covered fingers curled around the strap of a camouflage duffel bag. This man wasn\u2019t one of those young, green city boys looking for \u201creal\u201d ranch work and a wild Western adventure. This guy was one hundred percent cowboy, from the tips of his scuffed Tony Lamas to the brim of his dusty black Resistol.</p> <p>Chassie probably looked like a rube, or worse that unkempt woman from American Gothic, standing in front of their old wooden barn holding a pitchfork. She resisted fussing with her hair and called out, \u201cSomething I can help you with?\u201d</p><p>When he lifted his head, Chassie\u2019s breath caught. Good Lord. He was easily the most dazzling man she\u2019d ever set eyes on. Thick black hair, tawny brown eyes fringed with dark eyelashes, and razor-sharp cheekbones that flared into a blocky jaw. Coppery-colored lips stretched wide and full below a thin blade of a nose. His smooth skin glowed the color of rich coffee liberally laced with cream. At first glance, his body appeared whipcord lean, but she suspected beneath those clothes was a muscular force to be reckoned with.</p><p>The duffel bag hit the icy gravel. He pushed his hat back slightly and held out his gloved hand. \u201cHello. I\u2019m Edgard Mancuso.\u201d</p><p>When his voice rumbled out tinged with a foreign drawl, she bit back a feminine sigh. \u201cHowdy, Edgard. I\u2019m Chassie Glanzer. And forgive my bluntness, but what the hell are you doin\u2019 wanderin\u2019 around in the middle of winter? It\u2019s a good way to wind up coyote food.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, all brilliant white teeth, and her knees damn near collapsed. \u201cYou\u2019re a feisty one, eh? Bet he loves that. I\u2019m looking for Trevor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Does he owe you money?\u201d At the man\u2019s stark expression, Chassie said,</p><p>\u201cKidding. How do you know my husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe...we\u2019re old friends.\u201d</p><p>Huh. If that were true, why wasn\u2019t the man\u2019s name familiar?</p><p>Edgard carefully removed his gloves. \u201cI guess he didn\u2019t tell you about me. We used to be ropin\u2019 partners on the Mountains and Plains Circuit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? He might\u2019ve mentioned it in passing, but he hasn\u2019t been rodeoin\u2019 professionally for a couple of years. Where are you from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrazil. This is the first time I\u2019ve been in the U.S. since my run of luck with Trevor ended a few years back.\u201d</p><p>Chassie gave him another once-over. \u201cIf you were on that circuit, did you know my brother, Dag West?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I roped with him several times. Talented heeler and a good guy. I heard what happened. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Chassie wrapped her fingers around the pitchfork handle and hefted it out of the straw. \u201cYou wanna come up to the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Trevor expecting you?\u201d</p><p>Edgard released a strangled laugh. \u201cAh. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you\u2019d surprise him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on then. I\u2019m about due for a break anyway.\u201d</p><p>The crunch of boots on the ground was the only sound as she and Edgard trekked the long driveway to the old farmhouse.</p><p>Was this old friend of Trevor\u2019s comparing the humble West homeplace to the Glanzer showplace she\u2019d heard about but had never seen?</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. The house she\u2019d grown up in looked better now than it had in fifteen years. After Chassie\u2019s mother died, her father wouldn\u2019t \u201cwaste\u201d money fixing the problems, preferring to let the place fall into ruin. He hadn\u2019t had the knowledge or the drive to do the basic home maintenance himself. Yet he was too proud to hire his nephews, Chet and Remy West\u2014owners of a construction company\u2014even after they\u2019d offered to do the work at cost.</p><p>Between running the ranch and doing all the household chores, Chassie\u2019s exhaustion at the end of the day hadn\u2019t allowed for worries about peeling paint or figuring out what\u2019d caused the leak in the living room ceiling. Or to discover why the front porch sagged in the right corner.</p><p>Chassie had refused to squabble with her father about household issues or anything else. She\u2019d suffered enough traumas listening to Dad and Dag snapping and snarling at each other like rabid dogs over the dumbest things. To what end? Bitterness, regret, stupidity, and pride had killed both father and son.</p><p>But as soon as Trevor Glanzer hired on for shit wages, things\u2019d begun to change.</p><p>He\u2019d cajoled Harland into springing for new paint and spruced up the crappy siding. He\u2019d harassed the old man into buying shingles so Trevor could put on a new roof. Trevor resealed windows, fixed the furnace and installed a new water heater. Chassie helped him restore the house and often wondered if that\u2019s why she\u2019d fallen for him.</p><p>Right. His work ethic coupled with his smokin\u2019 hot physique...she hadn\u2019t stood a chance. Her immediate lust upon seeing golden-haired, golden-skinned Trevor whip off his shirt and climb on the roof half-naked had been an epiphany of sorts. Watching his tanned muscles straining, his buff body dripping with sweat as he hammered shingles, Chassie fantasized about having Trevor hammering into her.</p><p>Because of Trevor\u2019s reputation with the ladies and purported outrageous sexual appetites, she\u2019d figured he wouldn\u2019t look at her twice\u2014a petite, flat-chested, poor ethnic cowgirl was not the type of woman bad boy rodeo stud Trevor Glanzer pursued. Even if he\u2019d overlooked those details, she was his friend\u2019s little sister and sort of his boss.</p><p>But Trevor had noticed her. Even...wooed her, country style with every ounce of his cowboy charm. Accompanying her on horseback as they\u2019d checked cattle. Picking wildflowers and winding the colorful blossoms through her braided hair. Taking her dancing at local honky-tonks. Stealing kisses while washing dishes after supper.</p><p>Eventually sneaking into her room and loving her in the creaky, antique iron-framed bed. Rolling around with her in the warm sunshine in the hayloft for a steamy bout of fun sex. Staking his claim by fucking her mindless over a sawhorse in the machine shed. His secret sweetness was as much a part of him as his unmistakable sexual fire. Lust bloomed into love for both of them pretty damn fast.</p><p>Trevor stayed rock solid through the unexpected deaths of her brother and father.</p><p>Their mutual love of the land, the Western lifestyle and determination to rebuild the ranch, despite the odds, strengthened their bond. The day Trevor climbed up on the roof, shouted his love for her and asked her to marry him, she\u2019d never been so sure of anything in her life.</p><p>So a year after they\u2019d repeated those solemn vows in front of a judge, Chassie\u2019s heart still skipped a beat when she saw her hunky husband. Trevor was crouched over a makeshift plywood table in front of the porch, wrenching on the motor for the backup generator. He muttered to himself and swore, so he hadn\u2019t heard their approach.</p><p>\u201cTrev, there\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d Metal grinding on metal screeched in the cold air. Then, \u201cMotherfuckin\u2019 piece of shit.\u201d</p><p>Chassie glanced at Edgard who\u2019d gone completely still.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way to talk in front of company, hon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d Trevor spun around and froze.</p><p>A beat passed. Then Edgard said softly, \u201cHello, Trevor.\u201d</p><p>No one spoke; no one moved.</p><p>Trevor roared, \u201cYou motherfuckin\u2019 piece of shit.\u201d He threw the wrench and bulled toward Edgard.</p><p>Crap. Maybe they weren\u2019t friends after all.</p><p>Instead of tackling the man and pounding him into the ground, Trevor slapped Edgard on the back. Clasping him in a bear hug, lifting him in the air, practically swinging him in a circle.</p><p>Whoa. She\u2019d never seen her husband so...exuberant. From seeing an old friend she\u2019d never even heard of? Chassie\u2019s eyes met Trevor\u2019s in confusion and he hastily set Edgard down.</p><p>\u201cAh. Sorry, man. It\u2019s just...\u201d Trevor turned away.</p><p>As he composed himself, Chassie fired a sardonic look at Edgard. \u201cWell, I reckon he\u2019s happy to see you after all.\u201d</p><p>For Christsake, Edgard was here. Standing in his goddamn front yard.</p><p>Next to his wife.</p><p>How was he supposed to deal with this situation? At least he\u2019d stopped himself from laying a big, wet kiss on him.</p><p>Kissing another man. In front of his wife.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Chassie wasn\u2019t aware of his relationship with Edgard. Hell, he\u2019d barely mentioned the years they\u2019d team roped and traveled together because he didn\u2019t know if he could keep the truth about that intimate relationship hidden from her\u2014the woman had an uncanny emotional sense. So Chassie must be wondering about the male stranger her husband hugged like a long lost love.</p><p>Not a long lost love. Just a former rodeo pal. Keep it light. Friendly.</p><p>Trevor spun back around and grinned. \u201cShocked the shit out of me, Ed, to see you on American soil again. What\u2019re you doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>The tensed lines around Edgard\u2019s mouth diminished. \u201cJust passing through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your vehicle?\u201d Chassie asked.</p><p>\u201cIt broke down outside of Sundance. The mechanic said it\u2019d be a week before they can get the parts to fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich repair shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...D&amp;F?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll treat you right. My dad used to work there. I\u2019ll warn ya. They are slow as molasses in February. If they say a week it\u2019ll be at least two.\u201d</p><p>Edgard groaned.</p><p>\u201cMeantime, where are you stayin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chassie was so selfless Trevor wasn\u2019t surprised when she offered, \u201cAny friend of Trev\u2019s is a friend of mine. You\u2019re welcome to stay here as long as you want. We have plenty of room.\u201d</p><p>Say no, Edgard. For both our sakes say no.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very generous, Chassie. I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p> <p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. You wanna come in and get settled? Have a cup of coffee to warm up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>Chassie brushed past Trevor and started up the porch steps.</p><p>He could handle his former lover under his roof for a couple of days. No sweat, right?</p> <p>But when Trevor\u2019s eyes caught Edgard\u2019s, the punch of lust whomped him as sharply as a hoof to the belly, making him just as breathless.</p><p>Dammit, don\u2019t look at me that way, Ed. Please.</p><p>Edgard banked the hunger in those topaz-colored eyes and Trevor silently breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The blank stare was a reaction they\u2019d both mastered during the years they\u2019d spent together on the road. If sponsors, promoters or fans caught wind of his and Edgard\u2019s nocturnal proclivities they would\u2019ve been blackballed. Or would\u2019ve been beat to shit on a regular basis if the other rodeo cowboys suspected he and Edgard weren\u2019t merely traveling partners. There\u2019d been no choice but to become discreet.</p><p>Nothing discreet about the way Edgard had eyeballed him.</p><p>\u201cTrev, hon, you comin\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo on. I\u2019ll be right in after I take care of this motor.\u201d He retreated to the barn, needing to find his balance after being knocked sideways.</p><p>Edgard was here. Trevor\u2019s gut clenched remembering the last time he\u2019d seen the man. Remembering the misery on Edgard\u2019s face, knowing his face reflected the same desolation when they\u2019d said goodbye three and a half years ago.</p><p>Crippled by pain, fear, and loss, Trevor hadn\u2019t had the balls to wrap Edgard in his arms one last time. He\u2019d snapped off some dumbass comment and done nothing but sit on his ass in the horse trailer like a lump of moldy shit and watched him go.</p><p>No. Let him go.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten drunk that night. And every night after for damn near six months. He\u2019d fucked every woman who\u2019d crossed his path. Sex and booze did nothing to chase away the sense he\u2019d made a huge mistake. Or on the really bad nights, his all-too smug relief that he\u2019d never really felt \u201cthat way\u201d about Edgard and he was glad the too-tempting bastard was gone for good.</p><p>Yes, not only had Trevor mastered the outward lie, he was a master at lying to himself.</p><p>Watching his friends pair up, marry, and start families only emphasized Trevor\u2019s unhappiness. Every part of his life seemed meaningless. Chasing that elusive gold buckle.</p><p>For what? To instill a sense of family pride, even when Trevor knew nothing he accomplished would be good enough for his father, former world champion Tater Glanzer?</p> <p>The final straw occurred after the threesome with his buddy Cash Big Crow and Cash\u2019s then-girlfriend, Gemma Jansen. It wasn\u2019t an odd thing for Cash to call him and ask for help in giving Gemma an experience she\u2019d never forget: fucking two men at the same time. Trevor\u2019d always held a secret attraction to the bawdy Gemma, so he\u2019d shown up, more than willing to oblige.</p><p>But during the course of that sexual encounter, what\u2019d started out a fun, sexy and raunchy romp became awkward\u2014and very apparent three was a crowd.</p><p>It\u2019d never bothered Trevor to be considered the sweet-talking bad boy of the rodeo circuit. But the cavalier attitude toward sex came home to roost that summer night, when he realized that\u2019s all he was to his so-called friends. Good time Trevor; he\u2019ll fuck your women, drink your booze and back you in a bar fight. But don\u2019t call him for anything important because he\u2019s just another horny, drunken cowboy who\u2019ll be gone chasing eight and the gate at dawn.</p><p>The next day, Trevor swore off women, sex, booze and rodeo.</p><p>That summer also marked the breaking point with his family. For years he\u2019d suffered infighting with his siblings about who\u2019d take over the sizeable Glanzer ranch. Trevor hated how his dad played his kids against each other, especially when everyone in five counties snickered that Tater Glanzer had no intention of passing on the ranch until he was dead. Not only was his old man too mean to die, at age sixty-one it\u2019d be a helluva long time before they\u2019d need to build a pine box for the ornery SOB.</p><p>So two years ago, Trevor loaded up his horse, his measly belongings and cut himself off from his entire family. He hadn\u2019t regretted it. Next to marrying Chassie West, it was the best thing he\u2019d ever done.</p><p>Chassie.</p><p>Just the whisper of her name in his head brought a smile to his face and calmness to his soul. She\u2019d made him feel like a real man, a worthy man, for the first time in his thirty-year existence. Treating him like a rancher, not another good-for-nothin\u2019 washed-up rodeo cowboy. Listening to him when no one else would. Understanding him when he scarcely understood himself.</p><p>His sweet, loving, funny and stubborn wife embodied everything beautiful, good, honest and true in the world. She was every damn thing he\u2019d ever wanted in a life partner and never thought he\u2019d find or that he deserved. Trevor hadn\u2019t believed in love at first sight until he\u2019d met Chassie West.</p><p>You believed in it with Edgard.</p><p>Had he?</p><p>Yes. No. Maybe.</p><p>Shit. Trevor scrubbed his hands over his face. No, it wasn\u2019t love right off the bat with Edgard, even when he\u2019d suspected that was what it\u2019d become, even when he\u2019d refused to admit those feelings to Edgard or to himself. He\u2019d fought his damn attraction to Ed, mostly because it pissed him off to be attracted to a man.</p><p>It\u2019d been hard as hell to comprehend. He\u2019d never so much looked at another guy the way he looked at Edgard. Not once, in all his sexual escapades starting when he was a green lad of fifteen, had Trevor fantasized about fucking another man...until he\u2019d hooked up with the quiet, intense, sloe-eyed Brazilian.</p><p>No one besides their traveling partner, Colby McKay, ever knew the true nature of their relationship. As additional cover, Edgard participated in the wild sexual exploits on the road to rodeo glory. With a bevy of buckle bunnies following the three of them, the other male rodeo contestants lumped Edgard in with Trevor and Colby as players in musical bed partners.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s preference for men wasn\u2019t obvious to anyone. Except Trevor. Edgard never touched him suggestively. Nor did he come right out and state his desire to throw Trevor in his bed and fuck him like an animal.</p><p>After months of hot looks and evocative comments getting him nowhere, Trevor figured he\u2019d have to make the first move. It\u2019d taken him a pint of Jim Beam to act on the attraction and even then he\u2019d made a clumsy pass at Edgard. Kissing him sloppily.</p><p>Groping him between the legs.</p><p>But Edgard refused his advances, saying he wouldn\u2019t let alcohol be an excuse for them becoming lovers. Trevor would either come to Edgard completely sober or not at all.</p><p>So Trevor swallowed his pride, his fear, and practically begged. Edgard remained leery. Until that first explosive touch. In the two and a half years they were together, the heat between them never cooled, yet Trevor wondered if the urgency and secrecy contributed to the appeal.</p><p>Is that why Edgard was here? To rekindle that flame? To tempt Trevor away from Chassie? Or had Edgard found a new love and needed to prove there was nothing left between them but molten memories and deep regret?</p><p>Only one way to find out.</p><p>Trevor trudged from the barn and headed for the house.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>By the time Trevor finished scrubbing the machine oil from his hands, Chassie and Edgard had returned to the kitchen.</p><p>Chassie said, \u201cWho wants coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great, Chass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s cookies, unless Trev ate them all. The man has a serious sweet tooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I oughta munch on you, darlin\u2019, since you\u2019re so durn sweet.\u201d Trevor nibbled the side of her jaw and Chassie squealed. He reached above her head for the coffee cups on the pegs.</p><p>Trevor turned and saw Edgard staring at them. Not with jealousy, but with longing.</p><p>Simple affectionate moments had been rare between them and Trevor remembered it was one of the things Edgard had needed that Trevor hadn\u2019t been able to offer him. Why did he feel just as guilty about that shortcoming now as he had back then?</p><p>Chassie poured the coffee. Trevor automatically grabbed the milk jug from the fridge and set it next to Edgard. He snagged a spoon from the dish rack, passing it and the sugar canister to Edgard, ignoring Chassie\u2019s questioning stare.</p><p>Didn\u2019t mean a damn thing he remembered exactly how Edgard liked his coffee. Not a damn thing.</p><p>\u201cSo, Edgard, what are you doin\u2019 in our neck of the woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReliving some old memories. I drove past my grandparents\u2019 place yesterday. With the shabby way it\u2019s looking I\u2019m wishing I would\u2019ve bought it when I had the chance.\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cI\u2019m kicking myself for letting another thing slip through my fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandparents?\u201d Chassie repeated, not noticing Trevor\u2019s rigid posture after Edgard\u2019s comment. \u201cYou from around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And no.\u201d Edgard relayed the story about his mother. Getting pregnant as a foreign exchange student, giving birth to Edgard before his biological father, a young cowboy, died in an accident. She\u2019d returned home to Brazil and married Edgard\u2019s stepfather.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. That\u2019s kind of soap-operaish, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d Edgard blew across his coffee. \u201cBut it does make me an American citizen so I can come and go as I please in the good ol\u2019 U.S. of A.\u201d</p><p>Trevor listened as Chassie asked a million questions about Edgard\u2019s life and Brazil.</p><p>They finished off the pot of coffee and the time passed pleasantly. He even managed to meet Edgard\u2019s gaze a couple of times.</p><p>The phone rang and Chassie excused herself to answer it.</p><p>Silence hung between them as heavy as snow clouds in a winter sky.</p><p>Eventually, Edgard said, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know anything about me. Not even that we were roping partners. Not that we were...\u201d He looked at Trevor expectantly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Trevor quickly glanced at the living room where Chassie was chattering away.</p><p>\u201cYou surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that she isn\u2019t aware of our official association as roping partners. There was no shame in that. We were damn good together, Trev.\u201d</p><p>The word shame echoed like a slap. As good as they were together, it\u2019d never been enough, in an official capacity or behind closed doors. \u201cWhat are you really doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>Edgard didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Feeling restless. Had the urge to travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWyoming ain\u2019t exactly an exotic port of call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t realize that? You think I wouldn\u2019t rather be someplace else? But something...\u201d Edgard lowered his voice. \u201cAh, fuck it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant the truth? Or would you rather I lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth between us? That\u2019s refreshing.\u201d Edgard\u2019s gaze trapped his. \u201cI\u2019m here because of you.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s heart alternately stopped and soared, even when his answer was an indiscernible growl. \u201cFor Christsake, Ed. What the hell am I supposed to say to that?</p><p>With my wife in the next room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a big deal out of this. She thinks we\u2019re friends, which ain\u2019t a lie. We were partners before we were...\u201d Edgard gestured distractedly. \u201cIf she gets the wrong idea, it won\u2019t be from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m gettin\u2019 the wrong idea. The last thing you said to me when you fuckin\u2019 left me was that you weren\u2019t ever comin\u2019 back. And you made it goddamn clear you didn\u2019t want to be my friend. So why are you here?\u201d</p><p>Pause. He traced the rim of his coffee cup with a shaking fingertip. \u201cI heard about you gettin\u2019 married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat happened over a year ago and you came all the way from Brazil to congratulate me in person? Now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Edgard didn\u2019t seem to know what to do with his hands. He raked his fingers through his hair. His voice was barely audible. \u201cWill it piss you off if I admit I was curious about whether you\u2019re really happy, meu amore?\u201d</p><p>My love. My ass. Trevor snapped, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re pissed off? Or yes, you\u2019re happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen this is gonna piss you off even more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears and miles haven\u2019t changed anything between us and you goddamn well know it.\u201d</p><p>Trevor looked up; Edgard\u2019s golden eyes were laser beams slicing him open. \u201cIt don\u2019t matter. If you can\u2019t be my friend while you\u2019re in my house, walk out the fuckin\u2019 door. I will not allow either one of us to hurt my wife. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And I\u2019m done talkin\u2019 about this shit so don\u2019t bring it up again. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Chassie bounded back into the kitchen. If she sensed the tension she didn\u2019t remark on it. \u201cMy coffee break is over. Gotta get back to the grind. What\u2019re you guys gonna do?\u201d</p><p>Trevor gathered the cups and dumped them in the sink. \u201cI\u2019ll help you finish up outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. You stay and catch up with Edgard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, it ain\u2019t every day I offer to let you boss me around,\u201d Trevor pointed out with a teasing smile.</p><p>Edgard stood. \u201cIf it\u2019s all right, I might stretch out. I\u2019m bushed. Been a long morning and a long walk this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Trevor stared at him. Edgard had walked the twenty-five miles from town? In the cold?</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re hungry later, help yourself to whatever you can find. I already showed you where the towels and stuff are in the bathroom so make yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Chassie, you are very kind.\u201d Edgard headed for the stairs.</p><p>When he was gone, Chassie hooked her fingers in Trevor\u2019s belt loop. \u201cCome on, you\u2019re my slave for the next couple hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I like the sound of that.\u201d He lowered his head, teasing her lips before plunging his tongue inside her sweet, warm mouth. Kissing her until her heart raced beneath his palm and her body swayed closer. Trevor pulled back so they were a breath apart. \u201cBut I get my shot at bein\u2019 the master to your slave later, right?\u201d</p><p>Her soft moan smacked of sexual need and instantly stiffened his cock. \u201cNo ropes this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t no fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither is disinfecting the birthing equipment in the barn.\u201d</p><p>Trevor groaned. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doin\u2019 today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Has to be done when it\u2019s not sub-zero outside and you volunteered, bucko.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLead on, master.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. After she turned around, Trevor whacked her on the ass hard enough to elicit a yelp and she ran away from him, laughing.</p><p>Damn. He loved being married to this woman. He\u2019d be wise to remember that.</p><p>Two hours later Chassie peeled the sodden clothes from her body. Her T-shirt was halfway over her head when the bedroom door creaked open.</p><p>Before she unstuck the wet cotton from her arms, Trevor\u2019s big hands landed on her bare hips. She jumped and lost her balance, allowing Trevor to pick her up and lay her across the bed on her back.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, who do we have here?\u201d He crawled up her body, keeping her arms tangled up in the shirt so she couldn\u2019t see. He squeezed her legs together with his powerful thighs. \u201cA half-naked woman. Is it my half-naked woman? Can\u2019t tell by lookin\u2019 since your face is covered, so I\u2019ll have to find another way to figure it out.\u201d</p><p>The first flicker of Trevor\u2019s warm tongue over her cold nipple had her bowing off the bed. Chassie\u2019s arms and legs were immobilized\u2014not that she tried to scramble away when Trevor started suckling the puckered tip.</p><p>\u201cSure tastes like my woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>He grazed her nipple with his teeth and she gasped.</p><p>\u201cI recognize that gasp. You are my woman.\u201d Trevor swamped her with the sensual attack of his mouth. Lapping. Licking. Nibbling. His hands came into play, the callused pad of this thumb sweeping the underswell of her breast, then his fingertips drawing ever-smaller circles around her beaded flesh. Plucking and twisting one nipple while his mouth suckled its twin.</p><p>Chassie\u2019s face heated, her breathing escalated and the wet shirt molded to her face, making it difficult to draw a lungful of air. \u201cTrevor. Get this shirt off me. I\u2019m suffocating.\u201d</p><p>One fast yank and the shirt hit the carpet. She opened her eyes. Trevor\u2019s face was flushed. His pupils were dilated so no color remained. Need pulsed off him and thickened the air.</p><p>\u201cWant you, Chass. Want you bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuckily you have me.\u201d She reached for him.</p><p>\u201cUh-uh. Keep your hands above your head or I\u2019ll get the ropes out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t wanna be bossed around today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough. You\u2019ll take whatever I dish out.\u201d</p><p>Lord. He was in a mood.</p><p>He pushed off the bed, whipped his wet Wranglers and his pearl-snap shirt in a pile.</p><p>His beautiful naked body was back on top before she\u2019d taken two breaths. His mouth crushed hers in a drugging kiss. He skimmed his rough-skinned hand across her belly and between her legs. Upon finding the inside of her thighs soaked, he dragged his lips free, growling, \u201cYou\u2019re always so wet for me. That\u2019s one of the things I love about you, Chass. I\u2019m absolutely fuckin\u2019 lovesick with everything you give to me, everything you are to me. In bed and out.\u201d</p><p>His sweet, but reluctant confession surprised her.</p><p>Trevor wiggled two fingers into her pussy and swirled them in her slick cream. He withdrew and plunged deeper, grinding the bony heel of his hand on her clit as he dove back in for another thorough taste of her mouth.</p><p>As Chassie rocked her pelvis, Trevor\u2019s cock left a slick trail on her hip. She wanted to circle her fist around that velvety male hardness, stroking until his ejaculate exploded on her stomach. She wanted to clamp her hands on his ass and force his cock to replace his fingers.</p><p>Trevor wasn\u2019t swayed by her pleading whimpers. He maintained complete control, building her to the pinnacle.</p><p>Every pulse point hummed on a different frequency. Chassie squeezed his fingers with her internal muscles.</p><p>He feathered openmouthed kisses to the base of her neck. \u201cCome on, baby. You\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen use your mouth. Suck on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater. You\u2019re gonna come like this now.\u201d Trevor rotated his hand, added a third finger and circled his thumb over her swollen clit, stroking and rubbing the spots in tandem.</p><p>The change from random to deliberate concentration sent her careening into a double-whammy orgasm. Her pussy throbbed around his fingers, sucking them deeper with each spasm, while her clit pulsed beneath his thumb. When Trevor bit down on her right nipple, Chassie flat-out screamed.</p><p>Trevor scattered kisses across her breasts. Followed by a lazy sweep of his tongue up her neck. His rapid exhalations stirred the hair by her ear when he murmured, \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Always better when you touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Roll over. I want your ass.\u201d</p><p>His words sent dark excitement zipping through her again. He\u2019d warned her from the start he was sexually demanding. If they became lovers, no part of her body was off limits to him. Ever. He\u2019d fuck her pussy, her mouth, her tits and her ass, whenever, wherever and as often as he pleased.</p><p>Chassie\u2019s limited sexual experiences had in no way prepared her for Trevor Glanzer ruling her in bed. His concession to easing her into anal sex consisted of fucking her first with his fingers, then with a rubber dildo. Finally in a hard, fast, primitive manner that proved his complete possession.</p><p>It was heady stuff to be the focus of total sexual energy from a man such as Trevor; wickedly gorgeous, wickedly experienced and wickedly virile. Trevor pushed her boundaries and she trusted he\u2019d never hurt her in his quest to bring her complete sexual satisfaction. Sometimes Chassie wondered what Trevor considered kinky. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on, baby, roll over. Keep them arms above your head.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Chassie was on her belly, Trevor hiked her hips into the air and kneed her stance wider. Then all that burning, brawny male flesh brushed the inside of her thighs.</p><p>His thumb swept across her hole, over and over, bringing those sensitive nerve endings alive. Making her want. Tingles shot up her spine until she trembled.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sexy. This ain\u2019t gonna be gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m used to that by now.\u201d</p><p>He flattened his tongue on her tailbone and licked straight up to the hairline.</p><p>\u201cComplainin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d</p> <p>His chuckle pealed in her ear, danced like electricity across her skin. Trevor spread cool, wet lubrication over the pucker, easing one finger in. The sound of his rapid breathing as his free hand slicked more lube on his cock was beyond sexy.</p><p>Trevor\u2019s finger slipped out. His plump cockhead circled her anus before he pushed it past the tight ring of muscle and all the way into her ass on a single glide. He hissed. He withdrew slowly, even when she sensed his entire body vibrating with the need to pound into her. \u201cNever get used to how hot and tight you are. Never.\u201d With her ass cheeks in his hands, spreading her completely open to his cock and his hungry gaze, he rammed her with enough force the headboard smacked into the wall.</p><p>Chassie\u2019s world boiled down to the basics. Male heat surrounding her and the burning friction from his powerful thrusts. The scent of his sweat and the underlying hint of her own musk. The continual bang bang bang of the headboard. The loud slap of skin on skin. Trevor\u2019s rhythmic squeezing on her butt cheeks. Her fingers curled into the cotton sheets as he fucked her into oblivion.</p><p>His heavy breathing turned into grunts. \u201cSo fuckin\u2019 close. Bear down. That\u2019s it. So goddamn good.\u201d He shouted her name as he started to come, his pelvis slamming into her backside. Every thrust was punctuated with a loud groan, more animal than human.</p><p>Liquid heat burst inside her.</p><p>She loved every second of making this man lose control. Her hand slid between her legs. She stroked her swollen clit as her ass muscles milked his cock and it wasn\u2019t long before she was coming again. Trevor knew when her orgasm hit. When she cried out so did he. One last hoarse shout, and he quit moving.</p> <p>She collapsed to the mattress with a sigh.</p><p>He layered his damp chest over her back and kissed the slope of her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know being my cleaning slave turned you on so much.\u201d</p><p>Trevor nipped her ear. \u201cYou turn me on. In every way imaginable.\u201d</p><p>Time spent outside in the cold air always made her husband extra frisky. But it\u2019d been different today. A sharper edge to his lust. A more desperate need. \u201cSomething definitely got into you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething?\u201d He rolled his hips and his semi-soft dick twitched inside her. \u201cWho\u2019s in who right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off me, you brute.\u201d She sucked in a quick breath, even when he eased out with painstaking care. \u201cI think you broke the headboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas worth it. You oughta be talkin\u2019. One of them shrieks rattled the damn light fixtures. If Edgard was sleepin\u2019, he wasn\u2019t after that.\u201d</p> <p>Damn. She\u2019d completely forgotten about their houseguest. Chassie wondered if Trevor had forgotten too.</p><p>Or was that the reason for his overly amorous behavior? To prove to his buddy that marriage hadn\u2019t tamed him? He was still a wild man between the sheets?</p><p>A ripple of anxiety surfaced again and it wasn\u2019t as easy for her to shrug off this time.</p><p>After Trevor returned from the bathroom he flipped her on her back. \u201cNow I\u2019m ready to taste that sweet spot.\u201d</p><p>Definitely in a mood.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Thump thump thump.</p><p>Edgard sprawled on the bed in the guestroom next to Trevor and Chassie\u2019s bedroom, staring at the ceiling fan, listening to them having sex.</p><p>For the second time.</p><p>Which was pure torture.</p><p>No doubt in Edgard\u2019s mind that Trevor was fucking his hot little wife just to prove a point: Trevor didn\u2019t want him. Trevor didn\u2019t need him. Trevor knew full well that Edgard heard every squeak of the bedsprings, every deep male groan, every feminine plea, every collective gasp and pleasured scream through the paper-thin walls. Every telltale bang of the headboard.</p><p>Thump thump thump.</p><p>How fucked up would it be if Edgard unzipped his jeans and started whacking off to the sounds of their passion?</p><p>Seriously fucked up. Pathetically fucked up. Perverted.</p><p>\u201cWhat you do with other men is perverted and wrong. You disgust me. You disgust all of us. You should be ashamed.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Great timing for that ugly memory to pop up.</p><p>With the life altering events he\u2019d suffered recently, Edgard wondered if he\u2019d ever be happy again. Through his haze of melancholy his mother\u2019s lilting voice reminded him,</p><p>\u201cYou find happiness where you least expect it. When in doubt, go back to the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Thump thump thump.</p><p>Was it sheer idiocy that Edgard considered Trevor a beginning? When Edgard was the one who\u2019d ended things between them? Yet here he was, wishing for things he couldn\u2019t have. Creating more miserable memories to drown in.</p><p>Thump thump thump.</p><p>Then silence. No squeaking. No groaning.</p><p>Was Trevor indulging in his softer side with his wife? Kissing her sweetly and cuddling her to that amazingly hard, sweat-covered body? Giving Chassie the intimate connection in the aftermath of loving that Edgard used to revel in? That rare affection he\u2019d been so desperate to have?</p><p>Feminine giggles followed by male laughter echoed against the wall and put an ache in Edgard\u2019s soul.</p><p>Enough.</p><p>Edgard pushed to his feet, adjusted his throbbing cock and headed downstairs. The burning need to tuck tail and run was riding him hard as he slipped outside, but once again he was reminded he had nowhere else to go.</p><p>Later, when they\u2019d sat down to supper, Chassie said, \u201cSo, Edgard, you feelin\u2019 up to a little honky-tonkin\u2019 tonight? There\u2019s a great band playin\u2019 at the Rusty Spur.\u201d</p><p>Startled, Edgard peered up from his bowl of stew. \u201cIs there a special occasion for going out dancing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why would you ask that?\u201d</p><p>Edgard shrugged. \u201cBecause if I remember correctly, Trevor wasn\u2019t all that crazy about dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t.\u201d Chassie grinned at him. \u201cBut he convinced me he loved two-steppin\u2019 when we were dating. So I figure him tryin\u2019 to skip out on it now that we\u2019re married is cheatin\u2019 at best, false advertising at worst.\u201d</p><p>Trevor snorted.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I refuse to let us turn into one of those married couples who are old before their time. Don\u2019t do anything fun, don\u2019t try anything new, just work or become homebodies watchin\u2019 the boob tube as entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You just wanna flaunt your hot little ass at all those horny ranch hands who didn\u2019t pay attention to you when you were single,\u201d Trevor said dryly.</p><p>\u201cCan you blame me? It\u2019s such sweet revenge to see them trippin\u2019 over their boots and tongues when they see me shakin\u2019 my groove thang.\u201d Chassie snagged a dinner roll.</p><p>\u201cPlease make my whole night, Ed. Tell me you love to dance and you were Brazilian national tango champion or something.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back, absolutely charmed by Trevor\u2019s wife. \u201cI can\u2019t claim champion status, but I know my way around a dance floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay! I take it you and Trevor went dancin\u2019 once or twice when you were traveling together?\u201d</p><p>Chassie didn\u2019t mean he and Trevor danced together as partners, but it did remind Edgard of the few times he\u2019d convinced Trevor to dance with him when they\u2019d been alone. It\u2019d been disastrous. The man had two left feet. \u201cAh. Yeah. We went out to the rodeo or community dances sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, dish the details on my husband\u2019s bad behavior on the circuit.\u201d</p><p>Another loaded question. Edgard countered, \u201cYou trying to get me in trouble, Miz Chassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019d like to hear an insider\u2019s point of view since Colby won\u2019t tell me nothin\u2019 either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because your cousin is a smart man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPooh. It\u2019s not fair. You guys all stick together and keep your dirty little secrets.</p><p>That stuff happened a long time ago. What\u2019s the harm in telling me now?\u201d</p><p>Trevor and Edgard made a point of not looking at each other.</p><p>\u201cJust one little teeny-tiny thing?\u201d Chassie pleaded, \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Trevor who shrugged indifferently.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Must\u2019ve been five years ago, at a rodeo dance down south someplace, this pesky woman wouldn\u2019t leave Trev alone. Just to get rid of her, Trev agrees and she leads him out on the floor. Trev spins them around, stops, and acts like he\u2019s gonna barf. She freaks out and dumps him off with her friend, who Trevor had the hots for in the first place. So Trev\u2019s pulling this, \u2018I\u2019m so woozy\u2019 line of crap, convinces the little bunny he needs to lay down\u2014\u201d</p><p>Chassie rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and being the good Samaritan, the woman escorts him back to the living quarters in the horse trailer, where Trevor had a miraculous recovery. They ended up dancing after all.\u201d Edgard shook his head and sent Chassie a sly look. \u201c\u2019Cept it was mattress dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrev, you dog,\u201d Chassie said, slapping his arm.</p><p>Trevor howled, \u201cOw ow ow,\u201d and they all laughed.</p><p>\u201cThis is gonna be fun tonight with you two wild boys. Finally I\u2019m gonna have some sort of reputation to rival my cousin Keely\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Edgard wasn\u2019t convinced the three of them together out on the town was the best idea. \u201cYou sure you want me to come along, Chassie? I don\u2019t wanna be a third wheel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrev is relieved to be off the dancin\u2019 hook, aren\u2019t you, hon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019ll be more\u2019n happy to hold down a barstool and guard the beer while you\u2019re two-steppin\u2019.\u201d Trevor gave Edgard a genuine grin. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re in for, Ed. Chassie can go all night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the lucky man to test your stamina?

That uppity Brandy Martinson is so gonna eat her heart out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s used to no one noticing her when you\u2019re in the room, sweetheart,\u201d</p> <p>Edgard drawled.</p><p>\u201cEd, stop flirtin\u2019 with my wife.\u201d Trevor pointed at Chassie. \u201cAnd you better behave, missy. I ain\u2019t opposed to puttin\u2019 you over my knee and paddlin\u2019 that badonkadonk if the situation warrants it.\u201d</p><p>She stood and started stacking plates. \u201cYou threaten to spank me but you never follow through.\u201d She paused, looking thoughtfully at Edgard. \u201cSince I\u2019m not Trevor\u2019s usual type\u2014a big boobed blonde\u2014I wondered if Trevor\u2019s claim is true or if he\u2019s feedin\u2019 me a cowboy line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat line would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he\u2019s always had a thing for asses and it\u2019s the first body part he notices.\u201d</p> <p>Right. How could he answer that? Edgard\u2019s eyes darted to the clock on the microwave. \u201cWow, look at the time. Need help cleaning up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken,\u201d Chassie taunted. \u201cI will get to the bottom of all these secrets you two have.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s face read, I hope not.</p><p>\u201cLet me finish them supper dishes, sassy woman.\u201d Trevor snapped the air by her butt with a dishtowel. \u201cGet yourself gussied up and remember, we ain\u2019t got all night.\u201d</p><p>The bowls crashed in the sink. \u201cTrevor Glanzer. Are you implying I\u2019d need all night to make myself presentable?\u201d</p><p>Edgard grabbed the spatula in Chassie\u2019s hand and stepped between them, effortlessly herding her toward the stairs. \u201cNo, he\u2019s reminding you to hurry up because he\u2019s anxious to show you off. I imagine Trev gets a kick at seeing those poor suckers drooling over you, knowing you\u2019re gonna be mattress dancing with him at the end of the night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuch sweet bullshit, but I\u2019ll take every bit of flattery fallin\u2019 from those sugar lips, sugar.\u201d Chassie left a loud, smacking kiss on Edgard\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Edgard experienced a beat of utter pleasure, even when a sound resembling a jealous growl drifted from the sink.</p><p>\u201cI like him, Trev. He can stay as long as he wants.\u201d She darted an arch look over her shoulder at her husband. \u201cHowever, you might be sleepin\u2019 in the barn.\u201d</p><p>The band started off the first set with a cover of Dierks Bentley\u2019s \u201cLot of Leavin\u2019 Left to Do\u201d and the dance floor filled.</p><p>Chassie parked herself between Trevor and Edgard and thoroughly enjoyed the questioning glances sent their way. With his swarthy good looks, it was pretty obvious Edgard wasn\u2019t from around here.</p><p>\u201cI wanna dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChass, can you wait until I finish my beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I love this song.\u201d When the chorus kicked in, she joined in, \u201cBefore you go and turn me on...make sure that you can turn me loose.\u201d</p> <p>Both men stiffened.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t like my singing?\u201d</p><p>No answer from either one.</p><p>\u201cWell too bad,\u201d and she sang along a little louder.</p><p>\u201cChrist. You\u2019re in a feisty mood,\u201d Trevor grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Guess that counters the bad mood you\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to bicker.\u201d Edgard set down his bottle. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll dance with you until your feet blister and the cows come home.\u201d</p><p>The bass line started for Jason Aldean\u2019s \u201cHicktown\u201d and Edgard swung her into position.</p><p>Oh he was smooth. He glided them from one edge of the dance floor to the other, never missing a beat, never stepping on her toes, never once checking out any of the other female dancers. His focus was solely on her.</p><p>When the song segued into Kenny Chesney\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Blink\u201d Edgard smiled down at her. \u201cGo again? Or would you like to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I knew you\u2019d say that.\u201d He pulled her body closer to his and they swayed to the slower tempo.</p><p>While Chassie was squeezed against Edgard, she couldn\u2019t help but notice how good he smelled, a subtle scent that intensified when her nose brushed the gap between his shirt collar and his skin. She inhaled several times and wondered if the dizziness was just from the spinning.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head back. \u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were sniffling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sniffling, sniffing. I hope you don\u2019t think it sounds dorky, but man, you smell great. Really great.\u201d</p><p>Edgard actually blushed. \u201cAh. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to embarrass you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not used to such genuine compliments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019d think you\u2019d be immune, considering the way you look, because you probably get them all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much lately.\u201d</p><p>Chassie peered into his face. \u201cI might be totally off base, but you seem kinda unhappy. On guard. Like you\u2019re waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so? How can you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt times your pretty smile doesn\u2019t quite reach your pretty eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a flirt, Missus Glanzer.\u201d He smiled softly. \u201cBut you are a perceptive little thing.\u201d</p><p>She bumped him with her hip. \u201cHey. Who you callin\u2019 little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. What are you, about five foot nothin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah! I\u2019m five foot two and a quarter. Bein\u2019 small in stature doesn\u2019t mean I haven\u2019t been filled to the brim with my share of sadness, that\u2019s for damn sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why you\u2019re so good at recognizing it in others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I wish I wasn\u2019t. I wish I could just be a happy-go-lucky bubblehead with nothin\u2019 on my mind. It\u2019d be easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be easier for me too, sweetheart.\u201d Edgard urged her to move a bit faster as his polite way of ending the discussion.</p><p>When the song finished, Chassie latched onto his shirt as she stood on the tips of her boots. \u201cAny time you need to talk, track me down. I may be a lousy singer, but I\u2019m a good listener.\u201d</p><p>His warm lips brushed her forehead. Twice. Then he pressed a kiss to her mouth.</p><p>Twice. \u201cYou are beyond sweet. Thank you. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Back at the table, she released his hand and grabbed her purse, booking it to the ladies room. Didn\u2019t it just figure the next woman to walk in the bathroom was none other than Brandy Martinson? Chassie plastered on a fake smile when Brandy sidled up to her.</p><p>\u201cChassie! I was just looking for you. Who is that good-lookin\u2019 guy you were dancin\u2019 with?\u201d Brandy applied a coat of shiny orange lipstick, and smacked her lips together in a self-kiss before smiling cagily at Chassie in the mirror. \u201cBecause you were awful familiar with him.\u201d</p><p>Chassie jerked a paper towel from the dispenser. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you two look so much alike with your darker skin tones and dark hair I figured he had to be a relative.\u201d</p><p>A relative? Chassie patted Brandy\u2019s shoulder in a false show of comfort. \u201cAw, honey, you oughta wear your glasses all the time so you don\u2019t get so confused.\u201d</p><p>Brandy retorted, \u201cYou tellin\u2019 me the gorgeous guy you were cozied up to ain\u2019t your kin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord.\u201d Brandy\u2019s smooth white hand stopped mid hair fluff. \u201cAnd Trevor didn\u2019t mind you slow dancin\u2019 so suggestively with another man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor encouraged it actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he encourage that man to kiss you too?\u201d</p><p>Damn. Chassie didn\u2019t have near the experience with the female game of cat and mouse as the catty Brandy did. She tried a breezy laugh. \u201cOh that? It didn\u2019t bother Trevor in the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very...interesting.\u201d Brandy leaned into the mirror to check the concealer under her eyes. \u201cSo who is this mystery man who\u2019s allowed to kiss you in public?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend of Trevor\u2019s. They used to be ropin\u2019 partners on the circuit a few years back.\u201d</p><p>Done with her hair and face, Brandy spritzed on perfume. \u201cHe\u2019s just visiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now. But I don\u2019t mind tellin\u2019 you I hope he sticks around. He\u2019s really good with his hands.\u201d When Brandy froze mid-thirty-ninth spritz, Chassie bit her cheek to keep from laughing. She amended, \u201cI mean, he\u2019s a good hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d A malicious spark flared in Brandy\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised he\u2019s the wayward type. You seem to have a thing for picking up, ah, stray former rodeo cowboys.\u201d</p><p>Brandy might as well have sneered washed-up rodeo cowboys. Chassie allowed another smug grin. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a terrible chore watchin\u2019 all those big muscles bulging as my strays are workin\u2019 up a sweat. I especially hate the way they strut around in old, tight-fittin\u2019, faded Wranglers as they\u2019re loadin\u2019 haybales or bent over machinery. It does get tiresome, them constantly tryin\u2019 to take care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can see how the orphaned country girl scenario might be appealing to men like that\u2014for a while. But we both know how easily cowboys get bored and move on.\u201d</p><p>Chassie nodded. \u201cThat is the sad truth. Which reminds me, didn\u2019t your boyfriend Stevo go back to his pregnant wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-wife,\u201d she spit. \u201cAnd for your information, I ended it before he crawled back to that low-class breeder bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. Nice chattin\u2019, Brandy. See ya around.\u201d Chassie made a beeline for the door before things deteriorated.</p><p>Chassie didn\u2019t hate many people, but snotty Brandy Martinson topped the list. From the first day they\u2019d wound up in the same first grade class, Brandy had turned her pert, freckled nose up at Chassie. Brandy was a pampered town girl; Chassie a poor rural girl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brandy\u2019s natural blonde hair and big blue eyes were the ideal, whereas Chassie\u2019s mixed ethnicity meant looks of pity rather than jealousy. As she matured, Chassie accepted her heritage both as an Indian and a rancher, while Brandy maintained her air of superiority for being born pretty, white, and privileged. Years later Brandy still relished putting Chassie in her place, since she considered Chassie far beneath her social status.</p><p>A mental snort sounded in Chassie\u2019s head. As if Wyoming was the pinnacle of high society. As if being a \u201cnail technician specialist\u201d meant something besides Brandy filed fake claws and gossiped all day while drinking Diet Coke.</p><p>But she hated Brandy still had the power to make her feel like a dirty little rez reject.</p> <p>Chassie wasn\u2019t paying attention as she shuffled down the darkened hallway. She glanced up from her seen-better-days turquoise ropers into her husband\u2019s smiling face.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, darlin\u2019? You been gone a long time. I was gettin\u2019 worried.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around Trevor\u2019s waist, melting into him. \u201cI\u2019m better now that you\u2019re here. God, Trevor, I love you. Thank you for marrying me.\u201d</p><p>Trevor tipped her head back so he could look in her eyes. \u201cBaby? What\u2019s really goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>Crisis of faith. Sometimes when faced with the type of woman Trevor used to date and could\u2019ve married, she wondered why he\u2019d chosen her. \u201cNothin\u2019 that dancin\u2019 with you won\u2019t cure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe a pleasure to put a smile back on this pretty face I love so much.\u201d He guided her to the dance floor and held her closely through four songs. After the last note of the steel slide twanged, she stepped back. \u201cThanks, handsome.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her square on the mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. But you\u2019re gonna hafta block my lower half until we get to the table, \u2019cause dirty dancin\u2019 with you like that always gives me a hard-on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed. That\u2019s sweet, Trev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet?\u201d he growled. \u201cI ain\u2019t feelin\u2019 sweet. Not. At. All.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can show me your not-so-sweet side when we get home. But I am feelin\u2019 guilty for abandoning Edgard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a big boy. He can take care of himself.\u201d</p> <p>Once the crowd parted, she caught a glimpse of Edgard. He wasn\u2019t alone, but he didn\u2019t appear too pleased about his visitor.</p><p>Chassie\u2019s eyes narrowed at a puffy blonde head atop a narrow set of shoulders.</p><p>Brandy.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand the sudden burst of jealousy nor her need to act on it. She spun around right into Trevor. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Chassie skirted the table and snuck in behind Edgard, sliding her hands down his chest until their faces were side-by-side. \u201cHey, sugar pie. Didja miss me?\u201d She feathered her lips over his neck and flattened her palms against that rock-hard abdomen.</p><p>Edgard sucked in a quick breath. \u201cI, ah, yeah, I did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought so. Hope you weren\u2019t too bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, keep it PG in public, okay?\u201d Trevor jerked the stool next to Edgard and parked himself, as if he didn\u2019t mind his wife openly touching another man.</p><p>Thank you for playing along, Trev.</p><p>Trevor said, \u201cBrandy.\u201d No hello, how are you, or inane small talk.</p><p>In a fit of dating confessions, Chassie spilled her guts to him about how poorly Brandy treated her over the years. In a show of camaraderie, Trevor gave Brandy the cold shoulder whenever they crossed paths.</p><p>Edgard picked up on the vibe. He plucked her hand from his stomach and kissed her knuckles one at a time, tossing off Portuguese phrases.</p><p>The display was for show, but Chassie\u2019s knees went weak anyway. Edgard might\u2019ve been reciting a damn grocery list in that sexy-assed accent, but frankly, she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She could listen to those honeyed masculine tones all damn night.</p><p>Brandy stood abruptly and snapped, \u201cI have to go,\u201d before she flounced off.</p><p>Trevor and Edgard exchanged a devilish look.</p><p>When Chassie tried to snag a barstool, Trevor tugged her onto his lap. \u201cLeast you can do is show me a little affection after actin\u2019 so shameless with my best buddy, you brazen hussy.\u201d He nipped her earlobe and chills raced down her neck.</p><p>\u201cI take it she wasn\u2019t a friend of yours?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I know it was petty and third-gradish, but I\u2019m so sick of her smarmy little comments that I wanted to prove...\u201d Her gaze zoomed to Edgard and guilt punched a hole in her bubble of one-upsmanship. \u201cCrap. I\u2019m sorry. Were you seriously tryin\u2019 to hook up with her?\u201d</p><p>A horrified expression distorted Edgard\u2019s face. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not your type?\u201d</p><p>Another strange look passed between her husband and his friend. \u201cNot my type at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because she\u2019s a total bitch. Do you know what she asked me in the bathroom? If Edgard and I were related because we looked so much alike.\u201d</p><p>Trevor choked on his beer.</p><p>She angled her head to look at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think we look alike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides the fact you\u2019re a foot shorter than Ed, your hair is reddish brown where his is black? Not to mention your eyes are hazel, Edgard\u2019s are gold? You\u2019re part Indian, he\u2019s Brazilian, you have tits and he has a big cock? Yeah. You two are so much alike you could almost be goddamn twins.\u201d</p><p>Chassie laughed. \u201cSee? Brandy refused to believe that a man as hot lookin\u2019 as Edgard could possibly be with me voluntarily. So I don\u2019t care if she thinks we\u2019re havin\u2019 a threesome every damn night, it serves her nosy ass right.\u201d</p><p>A sputtering sound came from Edgard, then from Trevor.</p><p>Her gaze flicked between the two men. \u201cWhat is up with you guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, didja ever think that Brandy is gonna take great pleasure in tellin\u2019 everyone in the county that you\u2019re bangin\u2019 your husband and his friend? And it won\u2019t be disputed because half the damn county is in this bar right now, watchin\u2019 you feelin\u2019 him up.</p><p>Watchin\u2019 me let you feel him up.\u201d Trevor took another drink of his beer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lyin\u2019 when I say I don\u2019t care. Let \u2019em think what they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Chass, baby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Trevor, what is wrong with you? They\u2019ll think what they want anyway, especially if we start denying it, claiming it was all a joke. Screw \u2019em. We might as well have fun with it.\u201d Chassie upended Trevor\u2019s beer. \u201cWhat say you, Edgard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say I think it\u2019s time to hit the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Trevor removed Chassie from his lap and stood.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are no fun, I swear.\u201d Her eyes twinkled. \u201cMaybe the three of us should hold hands on the way to the truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely time to go.\u201d Trevor dragged her out of the bar.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>A few days later, the three amigos, as Chassie secretly called them, stood outside, drinking mugs of coffee. The morning started out typically chilly for February but Chassie knew the forecast for afternoon predicted a balmy fifty degrees.</p><p>Edgard hung back while Trevor and Chassie discussed the day\u2019s schedule. Checking cattle was their priority, twice every day, rain, snow, sleet, or heat. Chassie took the early morning shift while Trevor tended the herd in the evening. Rarely did they do the check together; it was a waste of manpower in their small operation.</p><p>Before he retreated to the barn, Trevor discouraged Edgard from helping with chores again\u2014a reaction Chassie didn\u2019t understand. Every damn day there was more work to be done around the ranch than time to do it. The fact Edgard had volunteered filled Chassie with relief. The fact Trevor discounted it filled Chassie with resentment.</p><p>She frowned as she backed the truck underneath the feed hopper. Something was up with Trevor. But whenever she asked him what was wrong, he wouldn\u2019t talk. Rationally, she knew most men were like that, especially cowboys, keeping concerns to themselves.</p><p>But she\u2019d believed Trevor was different. No, he had been different, which was why his about-face bugged her so much. Her husband was keeping secrets and she had a pretty decent idea what about.</p><p>Money.</p><p>The end of last summer they\u2019d crunched numbers and figured out pretty quickly in order to stay competitive in the cattle market, they\u2019d have to increase the size of their herd. Which they did. But it left them at absolute capacity for grazing areas. Land leases from the state or individual ranchers were few and far between. Bottom line: they needed more land.</p><p>As luck would have it, their neighbor to the south, Gus Dutton, was kicking around the idea of selling his acreage. Gus gave them a heads-up\u2014it was an unwritten rancher\u2019s creed to offer neighbors with bordering ranches a shot at purchasing the land before offering it to strangers. Not only had Gus approved of Chassie and Trevor\u2019s improvements to the West homeplace, he understood the struggle of trying to get ahead when developers and \u201chobby\u201d ranchers were swallowing up land all around you.</p><p>So, giddy at their apparent good fortune, Trevor and Chassie had scheduled an appointment with the family banker to discuss their options. But the banker\u2019s news wasn\u2019t good. Although Chassie owned the West ranch land outright, she had no credit history. Same went for Trevor because he\u2019d spent years living hand-to-mouth on the rodeo circuit.</p><p>The banker did present an option. Because they were otherwise debt free, if they could come up with ten percent of the purchase price as a cash down payment, the bank would be willing to lend them the remainder.</p><p>Not the answer they\u2019d hoped for, but one which showed the banker\u2019s faith in their ability to procure the funds. A totally misplaced faith since the couple was strapped for cash and living on next to nothing as it was.</p><p>If they didn\u2019t assure Gus Dutton they could meet his price, Gus would offer the parcel to the other neighbors whose land bordered his on his south end\u2014the McKays. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her cousins already owned most of four Wyoming counties. For the first time in her life she understood her father\u2019s resentment toward the ranching family. If the McKays got their hands on Dutton\u2019s land it\u2019d feel like encroachment, whereas if she and Trevor bought Dutton\u2019s land, it would feel like progress, despite either way they ended up with the McKays as neighbors.</p><p>Neither she nor Trevor owned anything worth anything. No antiques, or jewelry or heirlooms. Their pickups were running on baling twine and prayers. The farm equipment was ancient. They could sell off a couple bulls, a couple horses and it still wouldn\u2019t put a dent in the kind of cash they needed to come up with.</p><p>The financial situation weighed on Trevor, making him feel like he couldn\u2019t provide for her. He\u2019d considered asking his dad to loan them money, but Chassie would rather lose out on the land than have Trevor beholden in any way to his father.</p> <p>Which put them back at square one; dreams without the resources to realize them. So when that pensive look settled on her husband\u2019s handsome face, she didn\u2019t push.</p><p>The passenger\u2019s door slammed and Edgard climbed in, startling Chassie out of her brooding, as \u201ccake\u201d\u2014feed pellets for the cattle\u2014filled the metal bin in the truck bed.</p><p>\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you supposed to be checkin\u2019 on the repair status of your truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. It\u2019s not done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Does Trevor know you aren\u2019t in the house twiddling your thumbs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I beat feet past the machine shed where he\u2019s wrenching on some piece of metal and cussing like a truck driver. I\u2019m here, I might as well help out. I like helping out.</p><p>Actually, I miss doin\u2019 the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider yourself the official gate-opener again,\u201d Chassie said, shifting the truck into first gear. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to have your company.\u201d As Trevor had all but ignored Edgard in the last few days, Edgard had taken to riding along with her in the morning and hanging out with her in the house in the afternoons. They\u2019d had some damn interesting conversations.</p><p>After they\u2019d passed through the first gate and pasture, she said, \u201cTell me more about your ranch in Brazil. Is it a family operation?\u201d</p><p>Edgard pushed his hat back with a gloved hand. \u201cNo. I bought it with my rodeo earnings. It was close to my mother and stepfather\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs. Translation error.\u201d</p><p>The truth? Or just a way to cover up the slip?</p><p>\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s small compared to the wide open spaces in Wyoming, only about two hundred acres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many cattle can you run on a spread that size?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had three hundred head.\u201d</p><p>Again with the past tense. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of cattle on not a huge acreage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of rain, which means a lot of vegetation, so there\u2019s plenty of feed. I\u2019ll admit our cows are smaller and leaner than the ones I see here.\u201d</p><p>The herd swarmed the truck, recognizing the sound of food. Chassie pulled the cord on the hopper and the cake dropped to the ground beneath them as they putzed along.</p> <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s crass to ask, but how many head are you and Trevor running?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour hundred. We got an eighty percent pregnancy rate with breeding in early summer, so we\u2019re crossing our fingers for the birth survival rate to be around that same percentage. Even counting the heifers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUniversal truth that they\u2019re notoriously paranoid first time mothers, eh?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cMust be. So bein\u2019 so far south, do you calve around the same time of year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you aren\u2019t there to help out?\u201d</p><p>He angled his head toward the window. \u201cThis place is beautiful. So different from the jungle.\u201d</p><p>Chassie let the blatant subject change pass as they bumped over the rutted tracks. Her gaze caught on a moving object three hundred feet down the fence line. She snagged the binoculars from the middle of the seat and focused on the sagebrush. Not more than thirty seconds passed and she saw it move again.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA goddamn coyote.\u201d She eased the truck into a half circle for a better view. She shoved the stick into neutral and pushed the emergency brake to the floor. Carefully, she reached for her \u201cvarmint rifle\u201d on the gun rack behind her. No need to dig for ammo because it was already fully loaded.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna shoot it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Chassie didn\u2019t bother to look at Edgard when she said, \u201cGot a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We have our share of predators in Brazil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Wiley Coyote, Bambi lovin\u2019, PETA members don\u2019t understand why I\u2019d wanna kill a cute, fluffy little animal who\u2019s only actin\u2019 on instinct. After livin\u2019 on this land my entire life, I know those beasts are licking their chops for a cow to fall behind so they can attack it. Gets worse when we start calvin\u2019. If it comes down to my livelihood or a coyote\u2019s, it\u2019s my instinct to remind those scavengers I\u2019m at the top of the food chain for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t argue with that logic.\u201d</p><p>With the window rolled down, she poked the barrel out the window and trained her sight on the bushes. \u201cCome on out,\u201d she taunted. \u201cIt\u2019ll only hurt a little bit.\u201d</p><p>Edgard chuckled.</p><p>A reddish-gold face broke through the underbrush and Chassie fired. The animal jerked and ran. She ignored the slight ringing in her ears and fired again. The coyote dropped beyond the rise. \u201cHah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidja get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComes from lots of practice, on all sorts of guns, with all sorts of prey.\u201d</p><p>Edgard muttered, \u201cRemind me not to piss you off.\u201d</p><p>Holding the rifle across her lap, she popped the emergency brake and slammed the truck into gear.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do with it if it\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019. Leave it as crow bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t skin it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Isn\u2019t there money in skins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hide and tail should be worth cash, but you\u2019ll see why the majority of coyotes around here are worthless.\u201d</p><p>After Chassie crested the rise, she slowed, seeing the form lying on the grayish-white snow. Once they were within ten feet of the carcass, she stopped the truck.</p><p>They both hopped out and met at the hood.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit that\u2019s nasty,\u201d Edgard said.</p><p>The male coyote was scrawny, emaciated to the point each rib showed. The front and back legs were stick-thin and covered in oozing sores. The animal\u2019s fur was matted in places; bald spots dotted the rest of the skeletal body. Only four teeth were visible from the slackened jaw.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScabies. It\u2019s an epidemic. It doesn\u2019t matter, young, old, male, female, the disease thrives in the dens. Lucky thing this one is out of the gene pool before mating season starts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He looks like he\u2019s had some good luck all right.\u201d</p><p>Chassie couldn\u2019t resist teasing, \u201cHey, there\u2019s a hacksaw under the seat. We could chop off the paws and convince folks that coyote feet are much luckier than rabbit feet.</p><p>Bet we could make a pile of cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a seriously sick sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>She smacked a kiss on his baby smooth cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re so sweet. You ready for lunch?\u201d</p><p>Edgard gave a mock shudder. \u201cI take it back. You are plain evil.\u201d</p><p>Since they were already out and about, Chassie took Edgard on an extended tour of the ranch. She pointed out the river valley and the summer grazing lands beyond it.</p><p>\u201cYou really love this chunk of earth, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s cheeks flamed. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m a little enthusiastic even after twenty-five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never lived anywhere else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever wanted to.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to consider that. \u201cSo are you just content to stay here carrying on the family tradition, living on land, doing the same types of agricultural things that haven\u2019t changed for three generations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. There\u2019s been a few changes since Trevor and I took over. Things my dad wouldn\u2019t consider but were necessary. There are lots of new avenues I\u2019d like to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor instance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to raise goats.\u201d</p><p>Edgard laughed.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Trevor know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019d never convince him it\u2019s an animal we need. So it\u2019s pointless to ask him for a llama too.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI miss the old dairy cow we had before my mom got sick, so it\u2019d be fun to have goats to milk. Heck, I\u2019d even try my hand at makin\u2019 goat cheese.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled again. \u201cChassie the goat-herder. There\u2019s a fantasy worth visiting. I\u2019m getting an image of you wearing a skimpy X-rated Little Bo-Peep type costume with black vinyl fuck-me boots and a leather whip instead of a staff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinky. You sound exactly like Trevor.\u201d And why did the idea that Edgard found her fantasy material please her so much?</p><p>They chatted easily, as if they\u2019d been friends for years, which was odd, considering Edgard and Trevor were the ones who supposedly had the long-term friendship. Odder yet was the fact Chassie hadn\u2019t seen any sign of that close friendship.</p><p>By the time they returned to the ranch, a couple of hours had passed, during which they\u2019d discovered a mutual love of horror flicks, card games, and 1970s soul music.</p><p>But if Trevor\u2019s angry expression was any indication of his mood, she doubted he\u2019d be thrilled to learn of the interests she and Edgard shared. The second she\u2019d parked the truck, he stalked over and threw open the door. \u201cWhere the hell have you guys been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeedin\u2019 cattle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take three fuckin\u2019 hours to feed the cows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had extra time so I took Ed on a tour of the ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDurin\u2019 this private tour with Ed, did it occur to you that you hadn\u2019t taken your goddamn cell phone along? And maybe I worried that you\u2019d gotten stuck or something?\u201d</p> <p>Stung by his sharp tone, she retorted, \u201cIf you were so worried you could\u2019ve tracked me down on one of the four-wheelers.\u201d</p><p>Trevor growled.</p><p>Sugar worked better than vinegar with her grumpy\u2014jealous?\u2014husband. Chassie jumped into his arms and he staggered backward. Before he started another diatribe, she peppered his scowling face with kisses. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to give you more gray hairs, darlin\u2019. Let me make it up to you. However you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d Trevor whacked her ass twice before setting her down.</p><p>Edgard stopped in front of the truck. Trevor took a step back from Chassie and from Edgard and they didn\u2019t so much as look at each other.</p> <p>Weird. \u201cYou guys hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s at least an hour until lunchtime,\u201d Trevor pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWe on a shed-jewel now?\u201d</p><p>Her snooty pronunciation of schedule always amused him. He gave her his dazzling cowboy grin and her stomach flipped. Lord, she loved being married to this man.</p><p>Trevor bent down and kissed her. \u201cLunch later. I wancha to look at something in the barn first.\u201d</p><p>Edgard said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it. I\u2019m going up to the house for a bit.\u201d</p> <p>Chassie followed Trevor into the metal barn. Stalls covered half of one side. Tractor parts littered the walking space on the other side. She stepped over the makeshift partition and saw Trevor stopping in front of the farthest stall.</p><p>She sidled up beside him, needing to stand on the lowest rung of the gate to see over the top. Meridian, the beautiful quarter horse they\u2019d purchased the first month they\u2019d married, stared back. \u201cIs it time already?\u201d Chassie asked Trevor.</p><p>\u201cEither that or there\u2019s a big storm comin\u2019 \u2019cause she is mighty restless. She don\u2019t wanna eat, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, girl.\u201d Chassie held out her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Come on. Come over here.\u201d</p><p>Meridian didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Normally whenever Chassie showed up, Meridian pranced right up to her. Not so today. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now. We\u2019ll have to see. That\u2019s why I brought her in. I didn\u2019t trust that she wouldn\u2019t run off to that grove of trees she\u2019s so partial to.\u201d</p><p>No amount of coaxing would bring Meridian any closer.</p> <p>\u201cForget her. I have something else I wanna show you.\u201d Trevor snagged her hand and half-dragged her to the tack room. \u201cTa-da.\u201d</p><p>A big mound of tangled ropes and reins were piled in the middle of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI finally cleaned out the horse trailer. Lookit what I found. Hell, I forgot I even had half this stuff.\u201d</p><p>Lined up alongside the snake-like pile were saddles, spurs, spurs and more spurs.</p><p>Saddle blankets. Flank straps. Bits. Bridles. Brushes. Halters. Lead ropes. It looked like they\u2019d opened a Western tack store.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you gonna do with all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeparate it out. See what\u2019s worth keepin\u2019, what\u2019s worth sellin\u2019 and what needs hauled to the burnin\u2019 barrel.\u201d</p><p>Chassie glanced over at him. \u201cIs this a project that requires my help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Just tryin\u2019 to tie up a few loose ends. Been a pigsty and I needed to reorganize it because I won\u2019t get a chance when calvin\u2019 starts.\u201d Then Trevor stepped in front of her, forcing her to look up at him. \u201cI found something else you\u2019ll like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a candy bar? \u2019Cause, I\u2019m jonesin\u2019 for a big chunk of chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He snatched a braided purple rope from the slats. \u201cFeel this. Isn\u2019t it soft?</p><p>You\u2019ll appreciate that, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it won\u2019t mark your skin.\u201d Trevor eliminated the short distance between them. \u201cNow\u2019s the time for you to make it up to me for playin\u2019 hooky with another man.</p><p>Put your hands behind your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can use one of the scratchier ropes to tie you up if you\u2019d prefer?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cGood. Wrists together, behind your back.\u201d</p><p>Chassie complied. Might not be politically correct, but she was secretly thrilled when he demanded her sexual obedience.</p><p>Trevor moved behind her and wound the rope tight\u2014but not too tight. \u201cLet\u2019s go out in the main room, where there\u2019s a little more hay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHay for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a cushion for your knees.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Trevor hooked a finger in Chassie\u2019s front belt loop and led her to two rectangular haybales stacked together. He tossed his Carhartt jacket on the ground and faced her with a devilish smile. \u201cWhatcha waitin\u2019 for, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna suck you off right here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d His fingers went to his belt and he slid the leather strap from the belt loop, yanking the buckle away.</p><p>She seemed mesmerized by the jerky, impatient action.</p><p>\u201cChassie,\u201d he said sharply.</p><p>Obediently she dropped to her knees right in front of him with her back to the door.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>The heavy silver buckle dangled on one side, the finished end of the buffalo skin on the other side. He popped the button on the waistband, watching her face as he worked the zipper. With the fabric sides separated, Trevor tugged the jeans down past his hips, groin and thighs to his knees, leaving him in navy blue boxer briefs.</p><p>The patches of shadow in the building made her hazel eyes appear enormously large.</p><p>Trevor ran his right index finger over her strong jawline. \u201cSo obedient.\u201d He rotated his right hand and cupped her jaw. His left hand positioned his cock in front of her mouth.</p><p>Those pale lips opened. Chassie looked up at him for direction.</p><p>\u201cSuck the head.\u201d The shock of that warm, wet heat enclosing the sensitive skin caused his dick to jerk against her top teeth. He hissed.</p><p>Chassie kissed the small nick before she licked the thick rim. First with just the tip of her tongue, barely there whips of heated velvet intensified by her shallow breaths drifting over the wetness.</p><p>Chills raced from the nape of his neck to his tight balls. Trevor heard a noise and looked away from the sexy sight of his wife sucking his cock. It\u2019d be easy to miss the outline of a man in the darkened corner by the door, but Trevor was attuned to him.</p><p>Edgard shifted to the side and stared straight into Trevor\u2019s eyes.</p><p>There it was, that challenge. Show me.</p><p>It\u2019d always driven Edgard crazy to see a woman blowing Trevor. Sometimes Edgard demanded Trevor bring one of the buckle bunnies into their sex games, just to watch Trevor\u2019s body move as he fucked the woman. Edgard participated on occasion, but normally he\u2019d whack off while Trevor had his cock in the woman\u2019s throat. Or in her pussy. Then as soon as the woman left, Trevor was either on his knees servicing his demanding male lover, or spread-eagled on the bed while Edgard reamed his ass.</p><p>Golden eyes glowed feral as a cat\u2019s in the darkness as Edgard slid his hand down his own chest, to the crotch of his jeans. His palm drew circles over the bulge beneath the zipper and his breath puffed out in clouds of steam.</p><p>Don\u2019t let him in this moment between you and your wife.</p><p>But the reality of Edgard watching them had Trevor\u2019s cock rivaling concrete for hardness. He glanced down at Chassie. Shoulders thrown back, eyes closed, lips stretched around his prick. So beautiful. So willing. He wrapped her thick braid around his palm and pulled. \u201cFaster.\u201d</p><p>Chassie increased the rhythm without hesitation.</p><p>Trevor clutched her head and snapped his hips, driving his cock all the way in her saliva-slick mouth. Her lips tightened as he pulled out. She increased the suction, knowing exactly how he liked it\u2014tight and wet. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d Trevor\u2019s heart thundered, droplets of sweat forming on his forehead, even in the cold.</p><p>The harder he pumped into Chassie\u2019s mouth, the faster Edgard\u2019s hand stroked.</p><p>A tingle began in his spine and zoomed to his balls like a zip line. He loved this part.</p><p>The buildup. When every muscle in his body went rigid with anticipation.</p><p>Trevor didn\u2019t bother to hide the thoughts as he returned Edgard\u2019s stare. Don\u2019t you wish it was you on your knees in front of me? Pulling these guttural moans from my throat? Sucking down the taste of me?</p><p>A soft, affirmative noise echoed back to him.</p><p>He refocused on his wife\u2019s face. \u201cChass. Oh, baby, that\u2019s it.\u201d He seized her bobbing head, ceasing movement as the base of his spine heated. His cock swelled, lifting off her tongue before he exploded, come jetting out fast like a rocket booster. \u201cUh. Uh. Uh.</p><p>Yeah!\u201d</p><p>She swallowed steadily as every part of his body throbbed.</p><p>Trevor floated back to reality from that white space where nothing existed but physical awareness. He looked at the desire burning in Chassie\u2019s eyes as his cock slipped free from her mouth. He helped her to her feet and crushed her against his chest. \u201cYou...</p><p>Damn, woman, I can\u2019t even think straight.\u201d</p><p>Chassie trailed kisses up his neck. \u201cPlease, my turn now. I\u2019m dyin\u2019. Touch me. Untie my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need your hands for me to touch you, darlin\u2019.\u201d He curled his fingers around her shoulders, holding her steady for his hungry kiss.</p><p>A little squeaking moan burst in his mouth at the dueling play of tongues, the quick nip of teeth, the soft, wet slide of lips on lips and he smiled. He loved that noise, like his kiss was a welcome surprise.</p><p>Chassie broke away. \u201cFuck me, like this, right now. Keep my hands tied, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on, I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d He made short work of her belt. Unbuttoned and unzipped her jeans, loving the way her warm skin felt so soft beneath his rough fingertips as he shimmied the stiff fabric and her silky underwear below her knees. Trevor leaned over and picked up his coat. He tossed it over the haybale and whispered, \u201cSpin around and bend over.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chassie\u2019s whole body shook. Partially because she was so turned on, partially from the shock of having her ass hanging out in the cold winter air.</p><p>Trevor pressed behind her; his thighs cool, his thick sex still hot as it brushed over her bound wrists. Meaty hands squeezed her hips, then one slid between her hipbones and the coarse texture of his palm caused her belly to flutter. The fingers followed the cleft of her sex, straight through the curls to where she was sticky and aching.</p><p>He growled, \u201cBaby, you\u2019re already wet.\u201d</p><p>She pumped her pelvis. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>Trevor dipped his middle finger into the wetness and stroked her clit lightly, creating a slippery, tingly sensation. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaster.\u201d He started a rub/swirl combo and Chassie knew she wouldn\u2019t last long.</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Without missing a stroke, he placed his mouth on her ear and sucked the air clean out.</p><p>It sent her over the brink, as he knew it would. A dizzy, whirling sensation fogged her brain; a continual pulsing cinched her pussy muscles, her ass cheeks, her nipples into one synchronized throb. She bowed back into the curve of Trevor\u2019s neck and gasped at every delicious pulsation.</p><p>\u201cPut your feet on my boots.\u201d</p><p>Neither could adjust much, constricted by jeans shoved to their knees, but Chassie managed it.</p><p>Trevor swore. \u201cLooks like I\u2019m gonna hafta untie your hands after all. Brace yourself on that haybale, darlin\u2019, \u2019cause I could fuck you right through it.\u201d</p><p>The second the ropes were off, he maneuvered her over his coat, tilting her ass higher. Chassie placed her palms on the haybale and Trevor thrust hard and deep.</p><p>With her legs tightly trapped between his, he couldn\u2019t pull all the way out. Trevor\u2019s fingers found their way between her legs again. \u201cOne more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, even when it feels\u2014GOD, what was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething new.\u201d Trevor tapped her puffed up clit during a longer stroke. \u201cI call it Trevor\u2019s tantalizin\u2019 tantric trick.\u201d Two shallow thrusts, then a deep stroke as he tapped her clit.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cYou\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen savin\u2019 this secret love technique for a special occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>Thrust, thrust, stroke\u2014tap.

She squinted at the dimness and saw him.</p><p>Edgard.</p><p>Heat suffused her face. How long had Edgard been there? Since she\u2019d given Trevor a blowjob? Had it embarrassed him so he didn\u2019t want to call attention to his presence?</p><p>Or had it turned him on so much that he didn\u2019t want to leave?</p><p>Thrust, thrust, stroke\u2014tap. Thrust, thrust, stroke\u2014tap. Thrust, thrust, stroke\u2014tap.</p><p>Or maybe Edgard hoped to join in? Chassie knew her husband was no stranger to threesomes. She\u2019d never experienced that type of kink, never been curious about trying it...until now. What would it feel like to have both men touching her body? Two sets of hands, two mouths, two cocks competing to make her scream with pleasure?</p><p>Thrust, thrust, stroke\u2014tap. Thrust, thrust, stroke\u2014tap. Thrust, thrust, stroke\u2014tap.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to Edgard\u2019s midsection. Even in the muted light she saw his silver belt buckle hanging by his thigh and his jeans were undone. His right arm moved.</p><p>Thrust, thrust, stroke\u2014tap. Thrust, thrust, stroke\u2014tap. Thrust, thrust, stoke\u2014tap.</p><p>Holy shit. Edgard was jerking off. Jerking off right in front of her. Jerking off to the rhythm Trevor had set.</p><p>Chassie couldn\u2019t see Edgard\u2019s face, just the lower half of his body. She realized he had a perfect view of Trevor\u2019s hand between her legs and Trevor\u2019s ass pumping against hers as he fucked her. A shiver rolled from her neck to her belly.</p><p>Thrust, thrust, stroke\u2014tap. Thrust, thrust, stroke\u2014tap. Thrust, thrust, stroke\u2014tap.</p><p>Trevor growled, \u201cI wanna take your ass like this. Pumpin\u2019 into that tight little hole, drivin\u2019 you crazy, bringin\u2019 you off with my hand as I come deep inside you, feelin\u2019 your muscles squeezin\u2019 every drop from my cock.\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s eyes wandered to the shadow in the corner when she heard a soft half gasp/half groan. Edgard\u2019s fist made a slap slap slap sound and then stilled as ropes of come jetted out of the end of his cock and splatted to the dirt floor.</p><p>Trevor abandoned the tantric trick and pushed her at a deeper angle over the haybale as he fucked her like an animal and came with a roar.</p><p>The altered pace unleashed vibrations in her clit, her pussy, her nipples, and her anus. She literally sobbed, unable to breathe, to think, to move, wanting the sensations to stop. Wanting them never to stop.</p><p>Trevor murmured sweet words in her hair. He pulled out of her body and semen trickling down the inside of her leg brought her back to sanity.</p><p>When Chassie opened her eyes and looked to the shadows, Edgard was gone.</p><p>But he was far from forgotten.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Trevor was standing by the fence, untangling a pile of ropes he\u2019d unearthed in the horse trailer, when he heard the gate to the corral squeak open. He didn\u2019t bother to turn around because he sensed who\u2019d tracked him down.</p><p>Edgard.</p><p>Big surprise. How he\u2019d managed not to be alone with the man for the last two weeks was a minor miracle. He automatically tensed when the plodding footsteps stopped behind him. \u201cSomething wrong with Meridian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen whatcha need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d</p><p>Trevor didn\u2019t rise to the bait, as he hadn\u2019t for the last several days. Calmly, he asked,</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Edgard threw the pristine, custom-made saddle on the ground within Trevor\u2019s peripheral view.</p><p>Shit. How had Edgard found it? And why in the hell had that bastard gone snooping around instead of figuring out what was wrong with Meridian like he\u2019d promised?</p><p>\u201cTrev? I asked you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know damn good and well what it is, Ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you would\u2019ve gotten rid of it by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Edgard practically growled, \u201cThat don\u2019t tell me why you still have it. That don\u2019t tell me nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Trevor turned his face toward the opposite fence to gaze across to the mountains. His reasons for keeping the saddle seemed sentimental, sloppy and stupid now, but he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d share those reasons with anyone, least of all Edgard, the man responsible for those feelings.</p><p>Bootsteps made a sucking sound in the muck of the corral as Edgard closed the short distance between them. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna drop it. Answer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You said I could do whatever I wanted with it. So I kept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t use it at all, did you?\u201d</p><p>Trevor shook his head, keeping his eyes averted.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have plenty of other saddles, saddles I like better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a piss-poor excuse. Try again.\u201d</p><p>He stayed mum, wishing the damn mud would open up and swallow him like a sinkhole.</p><p>\u201cWere you hoping if you kept it I\u2019d come back?\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s heart said yes but his mouth stayed tight as a rusty hinge.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the fucking question, Trevor.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s arrogant streak snapped Trevor\u2019s forced patience. \u201cWhat do you want me to say? It\u2019s obvious I saved the goddamn saddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it reminded me of you, all right?\u201d He kicked a chunk of mud and stalked away. \u201cFuck this and fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Edgard rattled off something in Portuguese, something Trevor vaguely remembered as being a plea. Or was it a threat?</p><p>Dammit. His feet stopped. Trevor\u2019s gaze zeroed in on Edgard, who\u2019d circled him until they were standing less than a foot apart.</p><p>\u201cTell me why.\u201d</p><p>Be cruel, that\u2019ll nip this in the bud once and for all.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t keep the fuckin\u2019 thing because I had some girlish goddamn hope you\u2019d come back lookin\u2019 for it like Cinderella\u2019s lost glass slipper, and we\u2019d pick up where we left off after you left me.\u201d He locked his eyes to the liquid heat in Edgard\u2019s, not allowing the man to look away. \u201cEspecially after you made it crystal clear you weren\u2019t ever comin\u2019 back.\u201d</p><p>Angry puffs of breath distorted the air between them.</p><p>Several beats passed before Edgard retorted, \u201cBut I am here now, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Am I supposed to be flippin\u2019 cartwheels about that fact? I don\u2019t know what you want from me, Ed. Take the saddle back if that\u2019ll make you happy. I\u2019ve got no use for it. I never did.\u201d Angry, disgusted with himself, Edgard, and the whole uncomfortable situation, Trevor spun and walked toward the barn.</p><p>Edgard laughed\u2014the taunting, soft laughter that was guaranteed to raise Trevor\u2019s hackles and his ire. \u201cIt\u2019s that easy for you? To get pissed off and walk away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. You\u2019ve got no right to act so goddamned surprised since it\u2019s a trick I learned from you, amigo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not two seconds later, the air left Trevor\u2019s lungs as Edgard tackled him to the ground. Trevor rolled to dislodge the man from his back; Edgard countered, took a swing and missed. Trevor bucked and twisted his shoulders, but Edgard anticipated the move and used the momentum against Trevor to try and shove Trevor\u2019s face against the fence.</p><p>Before Edgard cornered him and held him down completely to land a punch, Trevor rolled again and pushed to his feet. A noise echoed behind him, but he ignored it as he fisted his hands in Edgard\u2019s shearling coat, dragging him upright until they were nose to nose.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell has gotten into you?\u201d</p> <p>Edgard attempted to jerk back. Trevor held tight.</p><p>\u201cThis is why you came here?\u201d he yelled in Edgard\u2019s face. \u201cTo sucker punch me and knock me in the fuckin\u2019 dirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>Edgard didn\u2019t move. He just breathed hard and stared hard at Trevor without flinching.</p> <p>Trevor\u2019s rapid breaths sliced the cold air but couldn\u2019t cut through the icy tension.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, goddammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came here for this,\u201d Edgard said angrily, wrapping a hand around Trevor\u2019s neck and smashing their mouths together.</p><p>The shock of Edgard\u2019s insistent lips caused Trevor to open his mouth in protest, which played perfectly into Edgard\u2019s plans as he jammed his tongue right into Trevor\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Damn damn damn. His token resistance was just that\u2014a momentary struggle with guilt as his body reminded him it\u2019d been an eternity, a fucking lifetime, since he\u2019d lost himself in Edgard\u2019s hungry kiss. Trevor\u2019s willpower vanished as the velvety smoothness of Edgard\u2019s lips slid against his, coaxing, teasing, demanding a reaction.</p><p>Trevor gave him one; a hot, deep, wet mating of lips, teeth and tongue as he thoroughly devoured what he\u2019d been denied, what he\u2019d secretly craved these last three years.</p> <p>When Edgard groaned in Trevor\u2019s mouth, the vibration traveled down Trevor\u2019s throat straight to his cock. His immediate hard-on was the invitation Edgard sought and Edgard ratcheted the kiss up another level.</p><p>Trevor instinctively matched his exhalations to Edgard\u2019s broken breaths, countered the bold strokes of Edgard\u2019s tongue with soft suction, found that familiar old lover\u2019s rhythm until even the beats of their hearts seemed synchronized. The sensual assault filled something in Trevor that he hated to admit had been empty.</p><p>Warning signs went unheeded as the ferocious kisses continued, kicking Trevor\u2019s need into high gear. But the unfamiliar prickle of Edgard\u2019s beard on his cheek began to rouse him from that dark desire. Coupled with the low-pitched masculine moans\u2014not Chassie\u2019s feminine sighs\u2014and Trevor broke away, knocking Edgard\u2019s hands free.</p><p>\u201cStop. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Edgard grabbed Trevor\u2019s shirt. \u201cThis is why I\u2019m here. Because it\u2019s still there, Trevor. This need didn\u2019t go away just because I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt don\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should. God. Please let it matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEd\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Just...don\u2019t.\u201d Edgard gently rested his forehead against Trevor\u2019s and retreated into silence.</p><p>The heat of their bodies, the cold air, the confusion, the passion, the anger, the guilt, all swirled in Trevor\u2019s head until he didn\u2019t know which way was up. Unable to squirm either closer or away, damn near unable to breathe, Trevor squeezed his eyes shut and gave in, leaning against Edgard, just for a moment.</p><p>Finally he dredged up a semblance of sanity. \u201cI love her, Ed. I\u2019m not with her because she was my second choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Why do you think it hurts me so bad, meu amore?\u201d</p><p>My love. That single, familiar endearment could prove to be his undoing. Another pause lingered before Trevor said, \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I swear to fucking God I cannot do this again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Trevor shook his head.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit. Look. At. Me.\u201d</p><p>Heart thumping crazily, Trevor pulled back and caught the golden gaze that\u2019d haunted his dreams since the day they\u2019d gone from friends to something more.</p><p>Edgard curled one hand around Trevor\u2019s face, keeping the other fisted in his shirt.</p><p>\u201cTell me how to fix this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t and talkin\u2019 about it ain\u2019t gonna change nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were always better at fucking away our problems rather than talking them out, eh?\u201d</p><p>No hint of a smile graced either of their faces.</p><p>\u201cNeither one of those is an option now.\u201d Trevor angled his head and impulsively kissed Edgard\u2019s rough palm before stepping back. But he\u2019d forgotten Edgard\u2019s sheer strength as the man halted his retreat.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember how good we were together? Our pricks rubbing together as we rolled on the bed until we exploded? You don\u2019t remember how wet and eager my mouth felt sucking every drop of spunk from your cock? You don\u2019t think about how deep I reamed that tight asshole of yours as you bucked and begged me for more?\u201d</p><p>Flashes of their past encounters made it impossible for Trevor to move away.</p><p>\u201cThe bondage games, your ass, cock, and balls spread for my taking. Jacking each other off in the silence of the horse trailer because we couldn\u2019t wait another second to be together. That burning need for a fuck or a suck or a handjob from a man who knows exactly how you like it\u2014is any of that ringing a bell? Or is it making you hard as a fencepost, Trev? Because I remember how hot you burned when I talked dirty as I was fucking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to stop, you stupid, stubborn bastard.\u201d Edgard snarled and devoured Trevor\u2019s mouth in another possessive, bruising kiss.</p><p>Before Trevor could break free from the temptation, a distressed gasp somewhere to the left speeded up the process. Trevor shoved Edgard away. He spun so fast he lost his balance. But the damage had been done.</p><p>Chassie stood in the shadows in absolute shock.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Not happening. Not happening. Not happening.</p><p>Her body, her will, her consciousness appeared to be floating in another dimension, as this one shifted and twisted into the surreal. She couldn\u2019t believe her eyes.</p><p>Not happening. Not happening. Not happening.</p><p>She had not witnessed her husband in the arms of another man. She had not seen him kissing another man like he was everything in his world. She had not heard the details of how they\u2019d been together, what they\u2019d been together. She had not imagined how badly they wanted to be together now.</p><p>Not happening. Not happening. Not happening.</p><p>The mantra she\u2019d used during her childhood to vanquish nightmares wasn\u2019t working this time.</p><p>It was happening and she\u2019d been a party to it all. From the corner of the chute where she\u2019d been an unwilling voyeur in the details of her husband\u2019s past life. She\u2019d watched Edgard approach and accuse. She\u2019d heard the angry longing and denial in Trevor\u2019s words and posture. She\u2019d observed the mating ritual\u2014the banter, the fight, the manifestation of desire resulting in pure physical passion.</p><p>Chassie couldn\u2019t process it. Not even when Trevor said, \u201cChassie, baby, let me explain.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak. Not even when she wanted to scream.</p><p>But when Trevor started toward her, she found the will to move. And so she did. She turned and ran.</p><p>\u201cNo! Chassie, wait! Don\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>Tears blurred her vision. Instead of running into the barn, she raced for the open field beyond the fence. Before she\u2019d reached the gate and her freedom, two strong arms banded her upper body, lifting her off the ground.</p><p>Her flight instinct fled and her fight instinct was in full gear. She kicked and thrashed and when she had enough air in her lungs, she began to holler. \u201cDon\u2019t you touch me!\u201d</p><p>Trevor flinched.</p><p>\u201cI mean it. Let me go! Let go of me right now, you cheating goddamn bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cChass. Calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down? Fuck that and fuck you.\u201d Chassie jerked her body sideways.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, so stop fightin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop touching me when I said to get your goddamn hands off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want that, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>A frustrated scream tore from her throat. \u201cYes I do. Let me go right fucking now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lying son of a bitch and I want you to let...me...go!\u201d she shrieked, hating the way he\u2019d immobilized her. Chassie drummed her bootheels into his shins, trying to bruise his body as badly as he\u2019d bruised her heart. She\u2019d twisted so violently against his iron hold that her hair had come loose from her ponytail and swirled around her head. A few strands stuck to her tear-stained face.</p><p>\u201cFuck, that hurts, you little hellcat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Anger renewed her determination to inflict pain on him. As she screamed and cried and kicked she knew she was completely out of control. But fighting back was her only option. Her mind and body relived the absolute desolation she\u2019d felt upon seeing the man she loved with another, seeing the longing and apparently long-denied need as Trevor had kissed Edgard like he was everything Trevor had ever wanted, everything he\u2019d ever needed, and she was just a second-rate substitute.</p><p>\u201cChassie. Please. Stop. I\u2019m beggin\u2019 you, baby, seein\u2019 you like this is breakin\u2019 me into a million fuckin\u2019 pieces and I...\u201d He paused. \u201cPlease. I need you to understand.\u201d</p><p>The raw pain in his voice gave her pause. She quit struggling. After a minute or so, Trevor sighed and gentled his hold, even as it seemed to strengthen him.</p><p>Neither one said a word.</p><p>Her rapid exhalations stirred her hair. Her blood pulsed angrily and her skin actually hurt. Her eyes smarted from hot tears. Her skull pounded like she\u2019d taken a 2X4 to the head. But that was nothing, nothing compared to the ache spreading inside her, leaving her both heavy-limbed and strangely hollow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Trevor whispered against her crown.</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I do will you talk to me? Give me a chance to explain?\u201d</p> <p>Chassie managed a pitiful laugh. \u201cWhat\u2019s to explain? You married me when you were in love with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, it\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to think. I know what I saw.\u201d</p><p>The silence was broken by Edgard\u2019s approach. Trevor\u2019s whole body tensed.</p><p>But Chassie wasn\u2019t about to back down. She wasn\u2019t in the wrong. She blew the hair out of her eyes and met Edgard\u2019s baleful stare dead on.</p> <p>Edgard said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did happen and if you want him so goddamn bad, you can have him. I\u2019m done with him. For good.\u201d</p><p>Rather than snap off a nasty comment, Edgard did the unexpected: he cupped Chassie\u2019s face in his hands and wiped her tears. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that, Chassie. You\u2019re angry. You should be. But you need to listen to Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t heard the important part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what part would that be, Edgard?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe part that concerns you.\u201d</p><p>Her scathing comeback dried up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t throw away everything because of a stupid mistake. Or your pride.\u201d Edgard smoothed his cold thumbs over her hot cheeks. \u201cNothin\u2019 happened between Trev and me besides some angry words and some frustrated kisses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted something to happen.\u201d</p><p>Edgard nodded. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Chassie searched his eyes for a sign of regret or smugness but all she saw was pain.</p><p>\u201cTalk to him, Chassie. Don\u2019t walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d she half-whispered.</p> <p>\u201cBecause if you do, you\u2019ll give me exactly what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for Trevor to dispute the statement, Edgard hefted the saddle on his shoulder and disappeared into the barn.</p><p>And without asking, Trevor released her.</p><p>It took every ounce of Chassie\u2019s nerve not to crumple into a pile and weep. She started toward the house, not caring if Trevor followed, even when she knew he would.</p><p>Her fingers fumbled as she removed her boots, coat and gloves, numb in body, soul and spirit.</p><p>In the kitchen she went straight for the liquor cabinet. After downing two shots of whiskey and nursing a third, she faced her husband.</p><p>A ghostly pallor replaced Trevor\u2019s usual rosy glow. He snagged the decanter, swigging the alcohol directly from the bottle. One. Two. Three solid mouthfuls.</p><p>A million questions tumbled in Chassie\u2019s head but one pushed front and center. \u201cAre you gay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I not just see you in a lip lock with your former male ropin\u2019 partner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Before you ask, I ain\u2019t bi either. It\u2019s just...\u201d He gestured helplessly. \u201cIt\u2019s just Edgard.\u201d</p><p>Chassie couldn\u2019t look at him, his mouth swollen from Edgard\u2019s kisses, his cheeks reddened from razor stubble, the agony burning in his eyes. She needed to remain in control and keep the gut-wrenching emotions in check. She spun back to the window, but focused on the amber liquid in her shot glass.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tune me out, Chass. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m just tryin\u2019 to figure out a way to ask if you ever had sex with Dag.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a harsh, surprised breath. \u201cGod, no.\u201d</p><p>Once again Chassie had that overwhelming sense of betrayal. \u201cDoes everybody suspect the truth about you and Edgard? Am I a laughingstock in the whole rodeo community? Everyone knew you took pity on poor Chassie West and married her because she was na\u00efve and no one else wanted her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, it ain\u2019t like that. Not at all.\u201d Trevor made a rough sound, a cross between a frustrated sigh and a snort. \u201cYou know how goddamned hard it is to keep a secret in that community. So if there\u2019d have been rumors about me\u2019n Ed, you\u2019d\u2019ve heard \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>True. There\u2019d been whispers about Dag\u2019s sexual preferences for years, but she\u2019d suspected her brother\u2019s proclivities before she\u2019d heard the gossip. \u201cHow long were you and Edgard...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor two and a half years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd during that time no one suspected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they? Edgard and I were together because we were travelin\u2019 and ropin\u2019 partners. And it wasn\u2019t like all of a sudden I stopped chasin\u2019 women. There were always plenty of women around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just another great visual I needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew a lot stuff about me before we got married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I wanna talk about this, Chass? You think I wanna relive all that past shit with my wife? You can\u2019t believe I get off hurtin\u2019 you. And I know this big mess is hurtin\u2019 you bad.\u201d She heard the slosh of alcohol as Trevor tipped the bottle and drank again. His voice was whiskey rough. \u201cHurtin\u2019 you, when I love you so goddamn much is killin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>That much wasn\u2019t a lie. Which was probably why this situation tore her guts out.</p><p>Even now she didn\u2019t doubt Trevor\u2019s feelings for her. From the moment they\u2019d slipped on their wedding rings and repeated their vows, Chassie hadn\u2019t worried he\u2019d cheat on her with another woman.</p><p>The idea of him cheating on her with another man had never crossed her mind.</p><p>Trevor interrupted her thoughts by saying, \u201cI take that back. One person did know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby. Only because he was our other travelin\u2019 partner and he ah...came in at a bad time one night. He didn\u2019t understand, but me\u2019n him have been friends forever. Colby is of the \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 mindset and Channing found out when she followed the circuit with us. Then Colby got injured and Ed went back to Brazil.\u201d</p><p>A burst of anger ripped through Chassie. Her cousin Colby hadn\u2019t warned her about marrying a man who was in love with another man? \u201cWhy did Edgard go back to Brazil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblems with his ranch down there. Problems with me because I couldn\u2019t give him what he wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA monogamous relationship. I couldn\u2019t be...\u201d Trevor paced behind her. \u201cEdgard is the only man I\u2019d ever felt like that about and it freaked me out. Christ. I didn\u2019t want to want him that way, but I did. Even after we started havin\u2019 sex, I never quit bein\u2019 with women. It wasn\u2019t because I was in denial of bein\u2019 gay or bi or any such shit. Edgard knew I wouldn\u2019t give them up and he didn\u2019t ask me to. That wasn\u2019t fair to him. Hell, even if women had stopped appealin\u2019 to me and I woulda been free to be only with him, I still wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI woulda lost everything. I know them kinda relationships are acceptable in a big city, but we both know that ain\u2019t so out here.\u201d</p><p>Chassie thought of her brother and the years he\u2019d fought to hide what he was. That struggle led Dag to douse his bitterness with alcohol, causing him to make bad decisions and the combination had eventually killed him. \u201cWas your time with Edgard just some kind of man-lust experiment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who am I supposed to ask, huh?\u201d The smartass response tumbled out before she could stop it.</p><p>\u201cI deserved that.\u201d Clothing shifted. Liquor slopped against the bottle. \u201cAll I know, all I\u2019ve ever known, all I ever wanted to be was a Wyoming rancher. Yeah, I chased the gold buckle due to family pressure, with my pa bein\u2019 world champ and all. I fooled myself tryin\u2019 to buy his pride by followin\u2019 in his footsteps. Truth was, I hid on the circuit. I didn\u2019t wanna go home and ranch with him because the thought of spendin\u2019 every day of the rest of my life at my pa\u2019s beck and call was the worst kinda punishment. Can you imagine how cruel my family\u2014and everyone in the community\u2014would\u2019ve treated me if they\u2019d known how I felt about Edgard?\u201d</p><p>She froze. \u201cHow did you feel about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChassie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love him?\u201d Do you still love him?</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d Trevor urged Chassie to face him. \u201cIt\u2019s been three and a half years since I\u2019ve seen or talked to Edgard, Chassie. I\u2019m in love with you. You\u2019re my wife. You\u2019re everything I ever wanted. You\u2019re the one I chose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I believe that you didn\u2019t settle for me because you didn\u2019t have the balls to choose Edgard? Now he\u2019s here. You\u2019ve broken with your family. This could be your chance to finally be with him. You don\u2019t have to settle for your second choice.\u201d</p><p>Trevor trapped Chassie\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cListen to me. You weren\u2019t sloppy seconds or the goddamned consolation prize. From the moment we met, you were it for me, you understand? I fell madly, crazily in love with you. Just you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to cry, but dammit, the tears started falling again.</p><p>\u201cChassie, baby, you weren\u2019t my last choice; you were my first choice. My only choice. I wanted to give you everything that I\u2019d never given another human being: my loyalty, my faithfulness, my love, and my name. I cannot imagine my life without you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened on her scalp. \u201cI\u2019ll send Edgard away. He never should\u2019ve come here and I shouldn\u2019t have let him stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me about him\u2014who he was to you\u2014from the start. I knew you weren\u2019t a saint when I married you, Trevor. I could give a shit who you\u2019d bedded before we met. Dammit, we\u2019ve talked about some of the women you fucked, the women I know personally, and your preference for threesomes. Honestly, those didn\u2019t bother me. But you not tellin\u2019 me about your relationship with Edgard? That bothers me. You\u2019ve assigned significance to him by keepin\u2019 your past relationship with him hidden.\u201d She scrutinized his too-blank face and felt as if a brick wall had sprouted between them. \u201cHe was very important to you, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally Trevor nodded.</p><p>Her stomach sank as if she\u2019d swallowed a spur. \u201cI can\u2019t handle you keepin\u2019 things like this from me. I lived in that world of half-truths and secrets for years, and I won\u2019t ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I. Which is why I didn\u2019t tell you about him.\u201d</p> <p>They stared at each other for several excruciating minutes, at an absolute stalemate.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I need some time to sort it out. And you and Edgard need to talk. Not only about what happened in the corral today, but about your unresolved issues from the past and why he tracked you down now.\u201d Chassie removed Trevor\u2019s hands from her face.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be with you until that\u2019s settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo buts. I\u2019m goin\u2019 to Wheatland to Zoey\u2019s bridal shower. I\u2019ll clear out for a day or so, just like I\u2019d planned.\u201d</p><p>A stark look darkened his blue eyes. \u201cNo. Baby, don\u2019t leave me. We can work on it here, together\u2014\u201d</p><p>Chassie placed her fingers over his lips. \u201cTrevor, I love you, but I\u2019d be lyin\u2019 to both of us if I didn\u2019t admit I hate you a little bit right now.\u201d</p><p>His whole posture slumped and his eyes were shiny with unshed tears.</p><p>She steeled herself against her need to soothe him. \u201cGive me some space. Stay here, take care of the ranch, and talk to Edgard. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Trevor frowned. He paced to the door. He returned and got right in her face. \u201cOkay.</p> <p>But if you don\u2019t come home to me within two days, I\u2019m comin\u2019 after you, Chassie.</p><p>You\u2019re mine. And I ain\u2019t ever lettin\u2019 you go.\u201d</p><p>Might make her a pathetic fool, but Chassie needed to be held by the only man who\u2019d ever held her heart. She wrapped her arms around his waist, pressing her face into his chest, listening to the rapid thump of his heartbeat. \u201cPromise me one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything, baby, anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t turn to Edgard when I\u2019m gone. Don\u2019t touch him, don\u2019t kiss him and don\u2019t fuck him. Please, promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>She backed away without looking at him. \u201cI have to finish packing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about this, Chass? Sure that leavin\u2019 is the best way to handle it?\u201d</p> <p>No. \u201cI\u2019ll have my cell with me, but please don\u2019t call. I need some time to think. I deserve that much.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d started for the stairs when Trevor called out, \u201cI love you. I\u2019ve never said that to anyone else in my life. Think on that.\u201d The outer door slammed.</p><p>Chassie loaded her lone suitcase in the truck and climbed in. As she headed down the driveway, she glanced in her rearview and saw Trevor standing alone in the middle of the road, his hands jammed in his pockets, watching her leave.</p><p>Hit the brakes. Don\u2019t go.</p><p>It was almost as if she heard Trevor\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>With a renewed burst of determination, she hit the gas and the open road.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Edgard stayed in the barn and closed his eyes, wondering why\u2019d he\u2019d given in to his masochistic tendencies. Was he that much of a prick he\u2019d hoped to come to Wyoming and find Trevor miserable? Married to a shrew? Longing for him? Filled with regret? Did Edgard expect Trevor would secretly beg Edgard to take him back?</p><p>Hell, Edgard didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do even if that warped fantasy came true, especially after meeting Chassie.</p><p>Trevor\u2019s wife was nothing like Edgard expected. In the years Edgard traveled with Trevor, Trevor\u2019s taste in women could be described as trashy, trashier and trashiest. Easy girly-girls with a \u201cdo me, cowboy\u201d gleam in their eyes and notches in their fancy rhinestone belts. Buckle bunnies with dyed hair, fake boobs, fake tans, fake nails, sporting expensive high-heeled fashion boots, low-cut shirts and low intellect. Real live cowgirls need not apply for a spot in Trevor\u2019s stable.</p><p>Those loose women\u2014young and old\u2014knew the score. One night as a no-holds-barred sexual plaything, not only for Trevor, but for whichever cowboy buddy Trevor invited along. Usually Colby volunteered as the third player. Occasionally Edgard bucked up for the fun and games. Adventurous women took on all three men at once. Their reputations as bad boys of the circuit were well earned. Partners and the positions might\u2019ve changed, but the rules never did: get off, get out, and get moving to the next town.</p><p>Even back then Edgard realized Trevor chose only horny, shallow women who didn\u2019t allow him emotional attachment, because every sexual encounter was temporary until Trevor found the woman who shared his longtime dream for home, hearth and a family of his own.</p><p>Chassie West fit the bill.</p><p>She was one hundred percent Wyoming cowgirl. Inquisitive, stubborn, knowledgeable about everything from livestock to environmental issues to up-to-date technology. Upon first glance, her pint-sized frame made her appear far younger than her twenty-five years. Up close she carried herself like a gunslinger, shoulders back, chin out, venom in her eye, ready to take on anything or anyone that crossed her in any way.</p><p>Chassie\u2019s sunny personality and genuinely helpful nature were completely guileless, yet those shrewd brown eyes missed nothing. From the first time he\u2019d looked into those soulful depths, he\u2019d seen her sadness and knew she recognized the same in him. Even when Edgard doubted her sorrow could be attributed to her feelings for Trevor, like part of his unhappiness was. Yet, her unspoken sense of failure, disappointments and guilt had been a bond of sorts between them, as much as the way they both felt about Trevor was an odd connection.</p><p>But was it the hidden glimpses of her waif-like stature that had drawn Trevor in?</p><p>Chassie wasn\u2019t beautiful in the traditional sense. No artfully applied makeup masked the ethnicity of her sharp facial features. Her long mane was stick straight, usually braided, not teased and shellacked into a perfect helmet. Her work-roughened hands hadn\u2019t ever seen the inside of a manicure studio. Her curves were in her hips and in her smile, not on her chest.</p><p>All in all, Chassie West Glanzer was something very special.</p><p>And that sucked because she deserved better than the treatment she\u2019d received this morning. When Edgard realized she\u2019d witnessed the encounter between him and Trevor, he experienced guilt on a level he\u2019d never imagined. Upon seeing the horror and pain on her sweet face, Edgard had the overwhelming desire to race to Chassie and wipe her tears, hold her close and murmur platitudes, which was damn stupid, since his damn stupid actions and words caused her distress in the first place.</p><p>What a fucked up mess.</p><p>How could he make this right? For Chassie? For Trevor? And for himself?</p><p>Leaving wasn\u2019t an option. Much as he liked Chassie, if the woman was foolish enough to walk away from Trevor for good, so be it. He\u2019d be around to pick up the pieces. Besides, it wasn\u2019t as if Edgard hadn\u2019t warned her of his intentions.</p><p>So why did he still feel guilty?</p><p>Because he was. He\u2019d done a stupid thing, which wasn\u2019t really new when it came to his dealings with anything or anyone involving Trevor.</p><p>The far barn door slid open and Edgard tensed. Chassie\u2019s truck had roared up the driveway not ten minutes ago. Knowing Trevor, he\u2019d fly in, spewing accusations at him, tossing off hurtful remarks, doing his level best to goad Edgard into a physical confrontation.</p><p>Isn\u2019t that what you did today? Pushed Trevor to see how far he\u2019d go with you?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Fuck, he was a selfish bastard. He and Trevor were used to each other\u2019s antagonistic behavior, poor Chassie wasn\u2019t privy to how they\u2019d normally settled their differences. Nor was she aware that Edgard and Trevor had ended up in dozens of knockdown, drag-out fistfights in their years together.</p><p>The last time they\u2019d fought, Trevor\u2019s need to win had been particularly vicious.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s surrender consisted of allowing himself to be tied naked to the slats in the horse trailer, standing, his ass level with Trevor\u2019s erect cock. Trevor had fucked him hard; hard enough bruises striped Edgard\u2019s thighs. Trevor fucked him twice like that, not letting Edgard come, making him beg. Then Trevor released the ropes and sucked Edgard off to the most explosive orgasm he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>Thinking about Trevor sucking you off isn\u2019t helping you stay neutral about this situation.</p><p>Edgard willed his dick to quit pulsing, determined not to give into Trevor\u2019s need to provoke him.</p><p>Sex would be off-the-charts fantastic, a little voice prodded him.</p><p>No. The aftermath would suck. Not only would Trevor blame him for them fucking like dogs, but the person it\u2019d hurt the most was Chassie. And they\u2019d both hurt her enough already.</p><p>But Trevor didn\u2019t swagger in, full of fire. He merely walked to the far side of the stall, several feet away from Edgard and draped his arms over the top of the wooden partition.</p><p>Meridian was restless. She ignored her owner and flicked her tail in annoyance at nothing.</p><p>They didn\u2019t talk; they didn\u2019t fight. They didn\u2019t fill the void with chatter; they didn\u2019t hurl accusations back and forth. They just stared at the hay-strewn stall and skittish horse in hellish silence.</p><p>A solid twenty minutes passed. Edgard timed it in fifteen-second intervals so it stretched out like twenty hours.</p><p>When Trevor ran the back of his hand across his cheek where Edgard\u2019s beard had abraded the skin, another punch of guilt tightened Edgard\u2019s gut. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Edgard let the moment linger. \u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Chassie left for a day or two. Said she needs time. Can\u2019t say as I blame her. This whole thing is majorly fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she is comin\u2019 back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Trevor finally looked at him. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me, Ed. I ain\u2019t gotta lotta patience left today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Edgard shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cLook, honest to God, Trev, I didn\u2019t plan for that to happen. I just...\u201d This was one of those times when translation was a bitch. He knew what he wanted to say, but couldn\u2019t find the words for it. \u201cGiven all the shitty things we used to do to each other, I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trevor spit tobacco juice on the ground. \u201cKnow the strange thing?

You still do it when you\u2019re agitated. I remember you used to do it a lot around me.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. It killed him that Trevor hadn\u2019t been as aloof as he\u2019d pretended. Or maybe Edgard had been so self-centered that he\u2019d been aloof to Trevor\u2019s perceptiveness.</p><p>\u201cSo spill it since we\u2019re already hip deep in shit.\u201d</p><p>Edgard caught himself touching his hair and dropped his hand. \u201cI want you like fucking crazy, Trev. That hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut do you know that I\u2019m not gonna do anything about it?\u201d</p> <p>Trevor\u2019s suspicious gaze snared his.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be making moves on you while Chassie\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>That blue-eyed stare narrowed further.</p><p>\u201cBetcha think that\u2019s contrary to my behavior today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a touch.\u201d</p><p>Edgard laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemme see if this washed-up rodeo cowboy has this right. You want me. You came all the way to Wyoming from Brazil so you could have me. Now that my wife knows what we used to be to each other, and she\u2019s gone...you\u2019re sittin\u2019 on your hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m gonna ask why, but why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d actually hoped to feel nothin\u2019 when I saw you again. You are everything I remembered you to be, better actually, probably as a result of marrying Chassie. She is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs what?\u201d Trevor asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cSweet. She doesn\u2019t deserve this. I never want to see that horrified look on her face again.\u201d</p><p>That comment sent Trevor back into full retreat.</p><p>Great.</p><p>After a while, Trevor said, \u201cKnow something funny? Chassie wants us to talk. She thinks it\u2019ll help if we get everything out in the open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she doesn\u2019t realize that was our issue? That we couldn\u2019t be open?\u201d</p><p>Trevor frowned. \u201cFirst time you\u2019ve said \u2018we\u2019 in that old argument, Ed. You always blamed me for us not holdin\u2019 hands and shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned the hard way maybe you were right about the kinda baggage other people hide when they\u2019re showing a different face to the world.\u201d</p><p>When Edgard didn\u2019t elaborate, Trevor demanded, \u201cYou gonna explain that comment? Or you gonna sit there with that smug-ass look and make me guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to explain it when you\u2019re in a piss-poor mood would be a waste of breath.\u201d</p><p>Edgard gave Trevor a cool once-over. \u201cAnd for the record, I\u2019m not acting smug. I\u2019m just as screwed up about all this with Chassie as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re happy as shit.\u201d</p><p>Seething, Edgard snapped, \u201cYou never had the balls to tell me how you felt when we were together every goddamn day, so don\u2019t you ever fucking presume to tell me anything about the way I feel now when you haven\u2019t seen me for three and a half fucking years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did, so just drop it. Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he retorted.</p><p>Meridian grunted and her tail slapped the wall again.</p><p>Time dragged on, yet there was no place Edgard would rather be than right there, even if they both were angry, frustrated and not speaking. Hell, it was practically normal for them.</p><p>Casually, Trevor remarked, \u201cYou\u2019re playin\u2019 with your hair again.\u201d</p><p>Edgard lowered his hand. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. Long as we\u2019re bein\u2019 honest and chattin\u2019, all friendly like, I wanna know if you stabled a corral full of young studs durin\u2019 the last few years? Or did you just pick one stallion to ride?\u201d</p><p>For claiming to be a plainspoken man, sometimes Trevor\u2019s verbiage confounded him. \u201cA few one-nighters here and there. Guy named Reynaldo stuck around longer than most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>Edgard shrugged. \u201cLess than a year. I wasn\u2019t sorry it ended, just the way it did.\u201d</p><p>Rey\u2019s outburst, \u201cI won\u2019t spend my life in the middle of a fuckin\u2019 jungle with a dirt-covered rancher\u201d , and Edgard had been glad to see the ass end of him.</p><p>\u201cBad break up with Reynaldo send you scurryin\u2019 back to the States?\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s tone smacked of conceit and Edgard sought to shatter his cool. \u201cNo. Rey was a great fuck. Nothin\u2019 that boy wouldn\u2019t do in bed. He wanted a sugar daddy, a citified papi with deep pockets. When Rey realized it wasn\u2019t gonna be a free ride, he bailed to richer pastures. He never was worth a shit with the livestock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll bet he was a pretty boy, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Thought I\u2019d try since that type ain\u2019t ever been my taste.\u201d</p><p>Trevor grimaced. \u201cAnd yet, somehow I\u2019m offended by that statement when I got no right to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to burst your bubble, Trev, but you ain\u2019t been pretty a day in your life. You\u2019re hot as shit in that, don\u2019t-fuck-with-me-I\u2019m-totally-hetero way, but definitely not pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis conversation is deteriorating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurnabout is fair play. How many bunnies hopped on you in that same time frame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay too many. I could lie and say I was such a fucktard because I\u2019d been drinkin\u2019, but mostly I was stone cold sober after the first six months after you left.\u201d Trevor picked at a chunk of wood in the gate top. \u201cI was miserable drunk and miserable sober.\u201d</p><p>Edgard lived that existence too. \u201cDamn good thing I barged my way back into your life and livened things up, eh?\u201d</p><p>Trevor laughed. \u201cAsshole. You always could make me laugh. Especially at shit that ain\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>How pathetic did it make him that Edgard lived for those moments of Trevor\u2019s unrestrained laughter?</p><p>\u201cWe had some good times, Ed. Easy to forget we were friends first. Even when we were nailin\u2019 each other at every chance, we were still friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I miss that constant companionship more than the sex.\u201d</p><p>Trevor appeared to be weighing his response\u2014probably disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeakin\u2019 of missin\u2019 companionship...she ain\u2019t been gone an hour and I already miss her. We haven\u2019t spent a single night apart since I moved in.\u201d</p><p>Be petty to point out after Trevor and Edgard became lovers they hadn\u2019t spent many nights apart either.</p><p>\u201cThink that\u2019s sappy? Think I\u2019m pussy-whipped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m jealous as hell. But if you get too lonely, remember, you can always crawl in bed with me. I\u2019ll warm the cock-les of your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, you\u2019re offerin\u2019 to polish my pole after all that \u2018I ain\u2019t touchin\u2019 you\u2019 line of bullshit...\u201d Trevor\u2019s voice trailed off when he noticed Edgard\u2019s big grin. \u201cReal funny. You\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 riot, Mancuso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust trying to lighten things up. I know this is serious stuff, but I\u2019m tired of standing around doing nothin\u2019. Don\u2019t you have fence post holes to dig or some menial, backbreaking, punishing shit work?\u201d</p><p>Trevor rolled his eyes. \u201cWhat part of livin\u2019 in the tundra is confusin\u2019 to you, jungle boy? The ground is frozen solid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s gotta be other chores that need done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, there\u2019s plenty to do around here, especially with Chass gone.\u201d</p><p>Meridian neighed loudly and flopped to the ground.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Trevor opened the door to the stall. \u201cThis\u2019s been goin\u2019 on for days. I have no idea what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to call the vet?\u201d</p><p>Trevor tossed off, \u201cCan\u2019t afford it. You\u2019re way better with horses. You wanna give me a hand? Maybe between the two of us we can figure something out.\u201d</p><p>For the next few hours they worked side by side. Without sexual tension. Without covert looks. Without accidental touches. Just two ranchers doing a job that\u2019d been a normal part of their lives, separately, but never together.</p><p>And for Edgard, it was enough. For now.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Chassie was such a basket case that she drove around for over an hour without remembering her destination.</p><p>Wheatland. For her friend Zoey\u2019s bridal shower.</p><p>Right. Like Chassie had any business passing out marital advice.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t go home, not after she\u2019d made such a point about needing time to sort things out. She could check into a motel. Hole up in misery and anonymity. Or she could drive to Denver and pour her heart out to her cousin Keely.</p><p>Damn humbling to realize she didn\u2019t have any place to go and few people in her life she could really talk to. Even if she claimed a dozen close girlfriends, the my-husband-is-in-love-with-another-man scenario smacked of an episode of Jerry Springer and wasn\u2019t a topic she felt comfortable discussing with anyone. She suspected whoever she told would tell someone else\u2014in complete confidence of course\u2014and that person would tell another person, and so on. The gossip, which Trevor and Edgard had managed to avoid for years, would run rampant.</p><p>Not to mention people would gape at her with pity. She\u2019d grown up being the brunt of those soft-eyed expressions. First because she was mixed race, unclaimed by her mother\u2019s tribe and shunned by most of her father\u2019s relatives. Didn\u2019t help that Chassie\u2019s family history included her father, who\u2019d built a reputation as a real asshole, her mother\u2019s status as a doormat, and the rumors about Dag before and after his tragic death. Chassie was the little half-breed with the weird name who\u2019d worked herself damn near to death to keep a ranch her lazy father had never wanted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yeah, this situation would be the real kicker.</p><p>Gossip had run amok when Trevor Glanzer married her. Now that Chassie really thought about it, why had Trevor pursued her with such zeal? Because he couldn\u2019t be with Edgard? So he\u2019d settled for her? Or because Trevor broke ties with his family and wanted a ranch to call his own? What would be an easier way to get quick land ownership than to charm the plain, simple daughter of a drunken fool? A lonely young woman who was set to inherit a ranch? A rundown ranch, to be sure, but it\u2019d be a perfect place to start.</p><p>That possibility filled her with such nausea that she pulled along the side of the road and dry heaved. Chassie left the truck running and pressed her forehead into the steering wheel. Wouldn\u2019t solve anything to bang her head against the molded plastic as she repeated dumb, dumb, dumb to the empty cab but she wanted to do it anyway.</p> <p>\u201cI love you. I\u2019ve never said that to another person. Think on that.\u201d</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s what hurt the most. Chassie believed Trevor really did love her. She\u2019d hoped for once in her life she alone would be enough to make someone happy.</p><p>But even on the best days, didn\u2019t you sense that pocket of emptiness inside Trevor?</p><p>Chassie had chalked up those niggling doubts to them living in an isolated location away from his friends and Trevor\u2019s estrangement from his family. She\u2019d never imagined he\u2019d be pining for a lover. A lover he\u2019d convinced himself he could not have.</p><p>A semi whizzed past, rocking her truck with a whoosh of cold air. She lifted her head and stared at the snow lining the ditches. Dread sat in her chest like a lump of coal as the drive to Wheatland loomed. She felt too raw to face party games, shiny new pans and the shiny new hope in Zoey\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>Chassie dialed Zoey\u2019s number, apologizing about missing the bridal shower as she spontaneously concocted a lie about Trevor being sick. It put her back to square one.</p><p>Nowhere to go and still wanting to talk to someone she could trust.</p><p>It hit her. Trevor said Colby knew the truth. She could talk to him. Dammit, he owed her after keeping this secret.</p><p>The line rang several times before Colby\u2019s wife Channing picked up with a breathless, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanning, it\u2019s Chassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. No, honey, I\u2019m not going anywhere. Dang it, hang on a second.\u201d A cry, then the scratchy noise of a receiver being shifted. \u201cSorry. Gib is cranky and insists I hold him all the time. So what\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs Colby around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He won\u2019t be back until later tonight. He went to an equipment auction with Cord and Colt and his dad. What did you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could try him on his cell.\u201d</p><p>Chassie fought the urge to cry. \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChassie? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>A sob was all she could get out through the tight feeling in her throat.</p><p>\u201cDid something happen to Trevor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear Lord, what?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t cry. Be strong.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cEdgard came back.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about them?\u201d</p><p>Gib started to cry. Channing said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come over and we\u2019ll talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Not nearly enough time to formulate all the questions she had, but it was a start.</p><p>Channing and Colby McKay\u2019s log house was as enchanting and homey and perfect as a cabin from a fairy tale. A fire burned in the slate fireplace. The scent of sugar cookies and coffee wafted from the kitchen. Toys\u2014trucks and horses mostly\u2014littered the living room.</p><p>Chassie sank into the oversized chenille loveseat. Western art decorated the log walls, as well as a few pieces she recognized as her cousin Carter McKay\u2019s artwork.</p><p>Hand knitted blankets in earth tones hung off the arms of the couch and the antique rocking chair. Children\u2019s books were stacked on the sturdy pine coffee table next to a box of crayons, a pad of paper, a plate of smashed up animal crackers and a half-eaten banana.</p><p>Channing came around the corner and paused. \u201cMore coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right back.\u201d A minute later Channing plopped on the couch directly across from Chassie and adjusted her shirt over her pregnant belly. She propped her feet up on the coffee table with a big sigh. \u201cMuch better.\u201d</p><p>Chassie had spent time around Channing at various family events over the last few years. Her cousin\u2019s wife was sweet, thoughtful and almost too nice to be true. Colby worshipped her. So Chassie was struggling with how this woman would view the situation between her, Trevor and Edgard.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get right to it. Tell me what happened after Edgard showed up.\u201d</p><p>While Chassie talked, and talked some more, Channing refilled her coffee cup.</p><p>Twice. Chassie realized Channing\u2019s up and down movement wasn\u2019t because the subject matter bothered her; rather it was as close as she could get to pacing without actually pacing.</p><p>After Chassie finished speaking, Channing handed her a tissue. \u201cThanks. I didn\u2019t mean to cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think it was odd if you weren\u2019t crying.\u201d</p><p>Chassie looked up. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone warn me about Trevor\u2019s past with Edgard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone meaning Colby or I?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cBecause, sweetie, and this may be hard to hear, but the details about that past relationship isn\u2019t our right to share with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find out?\u201d Chassie demanded.</p><p>Channing met her angry glare head on. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything you want to know on two conditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise that what we discuss is never repeated outside this room. And you keep an open mind about what you hear and don\u2019t pass judgment on anyone involved until you\u2019ve had time to think about it. Thoroughly.\u201d</p><p>Chassie figured that\u2019d be the most difficult promise to keep. But she wanted to know so badly...no, she wanted to understand so badly that she agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou asked how I found out about Trevor and Edgard? I walked in on them having sex.\u201d Channing appeared to wait for Chassie\u2019s gasp of outrage, and when she didn\u2019t hear it she continued. \u201cLong story short: Four years ago this summer, I wanted a wild Western adventure with a real cowboy. Colby said I could travel the circuit with them for ten days if I agreed to be their personal buckle bunny for all three men. Sometimes at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cYou...and...Trevor...did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And me and Trevor and Colby. And me and Trevor and Edgard. And me and Trevor alone. And me and Colby alone. Obviously I clicked with Colby from the start.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNo regrets because it was about experiencing all the sexual situations I\u2019d fantasized about.\u201d</p><p>Chassie reached for her coffee cup on the table and took a big drink to wet her dry mouth.</p><p>\u201cShocked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah.\u201d The true jolt of it would probably sink in later. Or would it be absorbed by the first, more brutal shock she\u2019d had earlier?</p><p>\u201cYou are aware of Trevor\u2019s past sexcapades?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I honestly didn\u2019t care about who he was with before me.\u201d Chassie paused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not upset Trevor was with you, Channing. But I am shocked he wasn\u2019t only with women but also with men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d Channing gently chided. \u201cTrevor hasn\u2019t been with any other man besides Edgard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Chassie gently chided right back. \u201cBeen damn near four years. How do you know Trevor hasn\u2019t been with another guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked in his eyes when he told me about falling for Edgard and I\u2019ve never seen such confusion and raw anguish. What he felt for Edgard went against everything he\u2019d ever known. Trevor couldn\u2019t give Edgard what Edgard needed, even when Edgard filled something in Trevor that Trevor needed. And Edgard couldn\u2019t stomach not being enough for Trevor, so Edgard returned to Brazil. Trevor wandered for a year or so. Made some tough decisions that\u2019d been weighing on him for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe situation with his family,\u201d Chassie said.</p><p>\u201cYes. Then he met you.\u201d Channing leaned forward but Chassie didn\u2019t have the guts to look her in the eye. \u201cTrevor loves you, Chassie, don\u2019t doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can\u2019t I?\u201d Chassie wiped her tears. \u201cGod. This is so fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sweetie, it is.\u201d Channing stood and returned to the kitchen.</p><p>Grateful that Channing had given her time to collect her thoughts, Chassie straightened her slumped shoulders, letting her head fall back onto the puffy couch cushion. She heard Channing return and settle across from her.</p><p>\u201cChanning, can I ask you something that might sound a little stupid and paranoid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Trevor married me because he felt sorry for me after my family died?</p><p>Or do you think he married me because I inherited the ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither. Did back-to-back funerals spur Trevor to pop the question faster?</p><p>Probably. Not out of pity, but because he loved you, he wanted to be with you and he didn\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Chassie lifted her head and looked at Channing for the first time since they\u2019d begun this conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to believe.\u201d</p><p>Channing didn\u2019t offer an opinion, she just waited.</p><p>\u201cI love him. He\u2019s everything to me. So how can I go home knowin\u2019 he\u2019s always been pining for someone he can\u2019t have? Someone he didn\u2019t even have the balls to tell me he wanted? Now that he\u2019s broken with his family, there is a much better chance he\u2019d consider it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll repeat it. Trevor loves you. He\u2019s chosen to make a life and a home with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Doubts plagued her\u2014was it really a choice he\u2019d freely made? Even now as a do-the-right-thing cowboy, Trevor would stick with her out of guilt or out of loyalty.</p><p>Did Chassie want that? Would she take Trevor any way she could get him? Even if it meant Trevor was miserable?</p><p>She blurted, \u201cWhat did you do when you walked in on Trevor and Edgard havin\u2019 sex?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith both those glorious men naked? As I was gorging myself on all sorts of sexual experiences I watched them finish what they\u2019d started. It was beautiful. Powerful. The hard bodies. The harder kisses. Strong and fast and a little mean.\u201d She frowned. \u201cIt surprised me that Edgard was dominant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Chassie breathed. \u201cBut Trevor is so...forceful.\u201d</p><p>Channing rubbed circles on her baby bump. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie. Seeing them together, lost in passion, was hot as hell. But it broke my damn heart to see how much affection they had for each other afterward. How they only dared express it when they were alone. I couldn\u2019t imagine not being able to touch or kiss or tease Colby whenever I wanted. I realized not everyone gets a happily ever after and it made me more determined to get one for myself.\u201d</p><p>Quiet pervaded as each woman was lost in her own thoughts.</p><p>Chassie drained her cold coffee. \u201cI was half-afraid to leave them alone together today. Even after Trevor promised me he wouldn\u2019t touch Edgard while I was gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you believe him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrangely enough, yes. But I have a sneakin\u2019 suspicion Edgard can be pretty damn persuasive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but I don\u2019t think Trevor will cheat on you.\u201d</p><p>She shot Channing a dark look. \u201cHe cheated on Edgard all the time.\u201d</p><p>Channing wagged a finger at her. \u201cAh-ah. Not true. Trevor was always up front with Edgard about wanting to be with women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Edgard with women too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Not like Trevor and Colby, but Edgard played his share of bedroom games with the women who took all three of them on.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she hadn\u2019t imagined Edgard flirting with her. Or was his attention just a ploy to make Trevor jealous?</p><p>\u201cOne time he told me...\u201d Channing shook her head. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re beyond never mind.\u201d</p><p>Channing\u2019s eyes were clouded with thought. \u201cOnce Edgard told me he wasn\u2019t bisexual. Insisted on it, actually. But I think if he was truly one hundred percent gay, he never would\u2019ve been with women, no matter what Trevor wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t men think about sex differently than women? A hole is a hole and any old hole to put their dicks in will do at the time?\u201d</p><p>A snorting laugh. \u201cI suppose. I\u2019ve known a few gay men who get all pissy when talk turns to bi men. It\u2019s the norm for them to diss \u2018switch hitters\u2019 wanting to have it both ways. But I\u2019m more inclined to believe there are few pure gays out there. I believe you fall in love with the person, not their sexual organs. And sometimes it\u2019s not what is expected.\u201d</p><p>Channing\u2019s pause burned through Chassie\u2019s patience. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think about Edgard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first thing that pops into my mind?\u201d Chassie paused and admitted, \u201cI\u2019m jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf their past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. Mostly it\u2019s because Edgard has a part of Trevor I\u2019ll never have. A part that was so special to Trevor he couldn\u2019t even tell me about it. And the flipside of that paranoid feeling is smugness, because I know if I demand Trevor send Edgard away, Trevor would do it. He probably wouldn\u2019t be happy. He\u2019d secretly resent the hell out of me, but Trevor would do it.\u201d Frustrated, Chassie smacked the pillow. \u201cDammit. I wish I could just hate Edgard. It\u2019d be easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides the fact he wants to fuck my husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. The man is flat-out beautiful. That sexy Portuguese accent is hot enough to melt the polar ice caps. He\u2019s sweet. Lord, he\u2019s so damn sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always liked that about him,\u201d Channing murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a damn hard worker. He\u2019s quiet, but it\u2019s a quiet strength, which is something neither Trev nor I have. He\u2019s refereed a couple of arguments between me and Trev, so he\u2019s got a diplomatic streak we\u2019re lacking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdgard used to get pissed off if he thought Colby was being mean, or if either Trevor or Colby were putting me in a traditional role as cook, cleaner, and laundress.\u201d</p><p>Chassie drummed her fingers on the cushion. \u201cYou know, that reminds me...Edgard was the one who calmed me down after I saw them kissing today. He\u2019s the one who urged me to stay and listen to Trevor when I tried to bolt.\u201d</p><p>Channing\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cHe was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hell, he even apologized. Said he wouldn\u2019t do anything to hurt me.\u201d Chassie fell silent as all the questions without answers spun around in her head. \u201cAnd it might sound stupid as shit, because it\u2019s in complete opposition to everything I\u2019ve just said, but how can I ignore the fact that Edgard loved Trevor so much? And Edgard walked away from Trevor\u2014even when it wasn\u2019t what Edgard wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. You shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdgard loved Trevor enough to let him go.\u201d That idea sank in, low, seeping into the marrow of her bones and she shivered with raw fear. \u201cGod, Channing, I don\u2019t know if I could do that. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if Trevor decides he made a mistake marryin\u2019 me and wants to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWants to what? Leave you and run off with Edgard?\u201d</p><p>Chassie nodded and wiped her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t try and convince you that\u2019s an irrational fear. But I will ask what you\u2019d be willing to do to keep that from happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d She repeated vehemently, \u201cI\u2019d do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe more specific. What would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean like go to counseling or something?\u201d</p><p>Channing shook her head. \u201cI mean would you really do whatever it takes to keep Trevor happy and with you? Even if the option he chooses isn\u2019t the easiest one for you?</p><p>Or Edgard? Even if the solution is the best one for Trevor? Even if it\u2019s an unconventional solution?\u201d</p><p>Chassie frowned, not following Channing\u2019s train of thought.</p><p>\u201cThink of it in the terms of that old saying \u2018my friend\u2019s enemies are my enemies\u2019, not that you and Edgard are enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re suggestin\u2019 something like...my lover\u2019s lover is my lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flicked to Channing. \u201cWhoa. All three of us? Living together in a...m\u00e9nage?\u201d</p><p>Channing nodded. \u201cThe French word m\u00e9nage a trois originally meant household of three, and it didn\u2019t just refer to sex as a threesome, but three people living together under one roof, so that...lifestyle choice has been around for a long time. It\u2019s nothing new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s new to me! I\u2019m supposed to consider welcoming my husband\u2019s former male lover into our life? And into our home? And into our bed? Sharing Trevor with Edgard?</p><p>Just to make Trevor happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStranger things have happened in the name of love, Chass. And you already told me you\u2019d do anything. If you are serious then you\u2019d better not discount the possibility because that is a reasonable, fair and possible solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I can\u2019t fathom how much more complicated that\u2019d make...well, everything.\u201d</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t it? Wouldn\u2019t that be harder?</p><p>Not harder than losing Trevor for good.</p><p>A cry sounded from the baby monitor, startling Chassie.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my boy. Think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt I\u2019ll be able to think of anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Be right back.\u201d Channing disappeared down the hallway.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Crazy thoughts spun in Chassie\u2019s head. How would a three-way relationship succeed for the long term? Dealing with sexual situations? And jealousy? Sleeping arrangements?</p><p>Financial responsibilities? Raising a family with one mother and two fathers in a part of the country that shunned anything out of the norm?</p><p>From the monitor came, \u201cMama, Mama,\u201d and bouncing squeaks Chassie imagined were from Gib jumping in his crib at the joy of seeing his mother. Channing murmured and the boy giggled.</p><p>That sweet sound made her smile. Chassie definitely wanted children someday and she knew Trevor did too. Did Edgard? Or did he have that sneering \u201cbreeder\u201d mindset so many same-sex couples had?</p><p>Thump thump thump. A little ball of energy barreled around the corner and ran straight at Chassie. Gib hit the soft couch cushion belly first, grabbed hold of the fabric in his fists and hoisted himself up. The boy didn\u2019t sit; he bounced. One, two, three times and the last bounce he landed on his diapered butt.</p><p>Chassie gasped and he giggled.</p><p>\u201cGib. No bouncing. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>He blinked innocently at his mother. \u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>Channing sighed. \u201cDaddy\u2019s gone, so you\u2019re out of luck with his \u2018boys will be boys\u2019 parenting philosophy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis darlin\u2019 face is impossible to resist, Channing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Channing straightened Gib\u2019s shirt. \u201cCan you say hi to Chassie?\u201d</p><p>Gib stared. No doubt the kid was all McKay. No doubt he\u2019d be hell on wheels, a serious heartbreaker with those deep dimples, mass of unruly black curls and enormous blue eyes. When Gib said, \u201cHi,\u201d and crawled in her lap, Chassie melted...for the thirty seconds the kid actually sat still. He heaved himself to the floor and was off again.</p><p>\u201cHow old is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen months. And yes, he\u2019s always like this. Busy from sunup to sundown.\u201d</p><p>Chassie glanced at Channing\u2019s belly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m five months along. When Gib was nine months old, I thought how much harder can one more kid be?\u201d She smiled ruefully. \u201cThen he started walking and getting into everything under the sun. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll learn how to climb out of his crib next because it\u2019s the only place I can keep him corralled.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gib ripped around the corner of the couch and stopped in front of Channing. He patted her stomach with both hands. \u201cBaby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, honey, that\u2019s the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine baby.\u201d</p> <p>Her smile softened and she lovingly brushed the curls from his face. \u201cYep, he\u2019s your baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know the sex of that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if the ultrasound hadn\u2019t confirmed it, I\u2019d be pretty safe in planning for another boy.

He gets it from his father.\u201d She stood and planted Gib on her hip. \u201cLet\u2019s have a snack, hmm?\u201d</p><p>For the remainder of the afternoon and early evening, Chassie was glad for the distraction of the rambunctious boy.</p><p>Chassie could tell Channing was tired and she felt guilty the pregnant mother elected to stay up with her after Gib finally conked out.</p> <p>\u201cColby should be home any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should go to bed. I\u2019ll be fine waiting up alone. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will. But I\u2019d like to see my husband while I\u2019m still conscious.\u201d</p><p>Channing closed her eyes and leaned her head back. \u201cDid you call Trevor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know where you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks I\u2019m in Wheatland at a bridal shower.\u201d Chassie braced herself for Channing to gently suggest she call him, but Channing didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>Chassie stared at the fire, trying not to think about how much her life had changed in one short day.</p> <p>Tick. Tick. Tick. The minute hand on the clock clicked and the bell dinged. Yippee.</p><p>She\u2019d managed to kill thirty minutes.</p><p>She was sure Channing had fallen asleep, so she was surprised when Channing murmured, \u201cYou really should watch them together. When they\u2019re naked in body and soul. It\u2019s as heartbreaking as it is beautiful. Then you\u2019ll understand. Then you\u2019ll do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>Watch who? Understand what?</p><p>The front door opened. Boots hit the tile and Colby strolled into the living room.</p><p>Channing\u2019s eyes blinked open. She appeared sleep-dazed for a second until she saw Colby. Then she smiled widely and pushed to her feet.</p><p>\u201cHey, shug, no need to get up. But since you are...\u201d Colby leaned down and kissed her. Thoroughly. \u201cMmm. Missed you today, darlin\u2019. How you feelin\u2019?\u201d He placed his big hands on her belly.</p><p>\u201cTired. This baby\u2019s been twisting like he\u2019s on a bull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Mama, cookin\u2019 up another wild cowboy.\u201d Colby rubbed circles on the baby bump. \u201cGib in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t happy you weren\u2019t here to tuck him in and play horsy. But he settled for Chassie reading to him.\u201d</p><p>Colby finally looked at her. \u201cHey, Chass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off to bed so you two can talk.\u201d Channing gave Chassie a wan smile. \u201cTry to get some sleep tonight, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try. Thanks for lettin\u2019 me just barge in and cry on your shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. That\u2019s what family is for.\u201d</p><p>Family. Maybe for the first time she really thought of Channing as her family too.</p><p>Colby said to Chassie, \u201cHang tight. I could use a beer, you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get them while I tuck my wife in. I\u2019ll be back in a bit.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later Colby returned. He tossed another log on the fire before he flopped across from her. He knocked back a drink of beer and sighed.</p><p>\u201cLong day?\u201d Chassie noticed Colby looked unusually exhausted.</p><p>\u201cI hate bein\u2019 away from Channing because I know she\u2019s doin\u2019 stuff she ain\u2019t supposed to when I ain\u2019t keepin\u2019 an eye on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay with the pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>Colby swigged his beer. \u201cShe\u2019s already had some contractions. Some spotting. She\u2019s not even supposed to be liftin\u2019 Gib, and that\u2019s the hardest thing for her not to do. She says it\u2019s normal, but I worry.\u201d</p><p>Shame swamped Chassie for busting in on Channing without warning and monopolizing her time. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I wouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you were here. Havin\u2019 company is a treat for her. Chan\u2019s been housebound with this pregnancy and Gib can be a real pistol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe definitely has energy to spare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my boy.\u201d Colby\u2019s grin was there and gone.</p><p>The logs in the fireplace crackled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m whupped, so let\u2019s get to it. When did Edgard show up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks ago.\u201d Chassie purposely droned on so this retelling had less tears, figuring Colby wouldn\u2019t appreciate them. Truth be told, she hated to cry. It was so damn pointless, it changed nothing.</p><p>After she finished, Colby grabbed two more beers. He appeared to be in a mental tug of war as he slowly peeled the label from the bottle.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Channing already explained, since she and I are on the same page. But I\u2019ll say it again.\u201d Colby looked at her. \u201cIt\u2019s not my secret to share. I imagine you feel a little betrayed by me too.\u201d</p><p>Chassie nodded.</p><p>\u201cTrevor and I\u2019ve been best friends since kindiegarten. We weathered some rough shit together. I have four brothers, and they\u2019re great, but Trevor\u2019s like the brother...I chose.</p><p>And it\u2019s the same for him, bein\u2019s that everyone in his family is a complete dickhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about his family but I haven\u2019t met them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider yourself lucky,\u201d he said derisively. \u201cIf it threw me for a goddamn loop when I figured out him and Edgard were more than ropin\u2019 partners, I can\u2019t imagine how them assholes in his family woulda reacted. I didn\u2019t pass judgment, mostly because I didn\u2019t understand. That said, I still covered for them on the circuit and no one ever found out.\u201d</p><p>It pained Chassie to ask, but she did anyway. \u201cDo you think Trevor and Edgard were in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh hell, Chass, how am I supposed to answer that?\u201d Colby downed half his beer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dyin\u2019 here. I found out the man I love, the man I married for Christsake, had a long time love affair with another man that I knew nothin\u2019 about.\u201d</p><p>Colby brooded for a bit. \u201cLemme ask you something. Would it\u2019ve been better or worse if a woman showed up knockin\u2019 on your door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse,\u201d she said automatically.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Edgard, I suspect it isn\u2019t the same type of love Trevor has given me. It\u2019s completely different. Separate. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the way Trevor loves me.\u201d</p><p>The truth of that statement hit her hard as a hammer to the head. Was it possible she wasn\u2019t jealous about Edgard, just hurt because she hadn\u2019t known about him? Chassie met Colby\u2019s stare.</p><p>\u201cThink on that statement very carefully before you make any rash decisions.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth. Closed it. She couldn\u2019t argue with that.</p><p>\u201cHow long\u2019s Ed here for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s been evasive whenever I\u2019ve asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d The beer stopped midair. \u201cHe and Trev haven\u2019t talked at all about Ed\u2019s place in Brazil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I thought it was kinda strange that Trev was avoidin\u2019 bein\u2019 alone with him and avoidin\u2019 personal conversation. Now I know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are things goin\u2019 with you and Trev at your homeplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I guess. Takin\u2019 it day by day.\u201d</p><p>He picked at the beer label. \u201cYou heard anything about Gus Dutton sellin\u2019 his place south of yours?\u201d</p><p>Chassie was a horrible liar. She settled for hedging. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat his kids and grandkids never visit and he\u2019s tired of bein\u2019 alone since his wife died. He ain\u2019t run any cattle for a few years.\u201d Colby pinned her with a shrewd look. \u201cYou leasin\u2019 his grazin\u2019 land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did this past summer. Why?\u201d</p><p>Colby shrugged. \u201cCurious. Sweet piece of dirt with all that creek frontage. Me\u2019n Cord have been eyein\u2019 it the last coupla years, and Dad for a while before that. We\u2019d be mighty interested in givin\u2019 old Gus a little better than fair market value for it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll bet you would.</p><p>She stood and studied the orange flames reflected in the glass fireplace panes.</p><p>\u201cThanks for talkin\u2019 to me. I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about this. I\u2019d never hurt Trevor.</p><p>Even as I\u2019m standing here practically bleeding inside, I would protect him at all costs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you would. I know he feels the same way, even though it probably don\u2019t seem like it.\u201d Colby reached for her hand and squeezed. \u201cGood night, little cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night.\u201d</p><p>Chassie crawled between the flannel sheets. Channing\u2019s rambling, \u201cYou really should watch them together when they\u2019re naked in body and soul. Then you\u2019ll understand, then you\u2019ll do the right thing,\u201d ricocheted in her head, mixing with the other gut-wrenching images she couldn\u2019t erase.</p><p>The desperation in their kiss. The anguished longing as they\u2019d stood pressed forehead to forehead in the corral. The murmured words. Their guilt. Their sadness.</p><p>As Chassie drifted into the realm between asleep and awake, she knew what she\u2019d have to do. She just hoped she\u2019d have the courage to ask and the guts to survive it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colby was dead tired. He\u2019d spent all day worrying about leaving Channing alone as he faced another McKay family situation. Lying to his wife didn\u2019t sit well with him.</p><p>She\u2019d been mighty upset regarding Edgard\u2019s surprise reappearance in Wyoming and Chassie\u2019s not-so-surprising impromptu visit. He had an aversion to upsetting Channing with more bad news.</p><p>All that coupled with ten hours spent with his brothers, staring at each other like a bunch of idiots as they waited for word. Compared to stressful days like this, it\u2019d been easy getting thrown off the back of a bronc or a bull.</p> <p>Stay out of it. It ain\u2019t your concern.</p><p>Like hell. He\u2019d always felt guilty about Chassie. She was a sweet, hardworking woman who\u2019d lived with family drama and disappointment. The gossip of her brother\u2019s not-so-secret preferences was partially what\u2019d justified Colby to keep the truth about Trevor and Edgard under his hat. He\u2019d seen what a few missteps and rumors had done to Dag\u2019s career. When Dag started losing, then Dag started drinking. It\u2019d spiraled from there.</p><p>Dag\u2019s fatal accident sent Uncle Harland to an early grave. But had the crises sent Chassie into the arms of the first man who noticed her?</p><p>No, Trevor hadn\u2019t taken advantage of Chassie. Trevor was a decent, honest, hardworking guy. A good guy.</p><p>A good guy who\u2019s been mooning for another man for years.</p> <p>Fuck. Colby couldn\u2019t let it slide. Not this time.</p><p>He propped his feet on the coffee table and hit speed dial number four on his cell phone. It rang once.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doin\u2019 callin\u2019 me at eleven at night, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got some stuff to say to you. Stuff that can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kinda stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to do with your wife.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Trevor\u2019s grip increased on his phone. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your wife, Trev?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know.</p><p>When he hadn\u2019t heard from Chassie, he\u2019d panicked and looked up her friend Zoey\u2019s number in Wheatland. She\u2019d informed Trevor that Chassie had called with her regrets earlier in the day. So Trevor looked like a fool for not knowing the whereabouts of his own wife.</p><p>Trevor admitted he and Chassie had a tiff before she\u2019d left and she wasn\u2019t answering her cell. He\u2019d jokingly offered the soon-to-be newlywed advice: never drive away mad. It seemed to allay Zoey\u2019s concerns.</p><p>But not Trevor\u2019s.</p><p>He\u2019d paced all damn afternoon, troubled something might\u2019ve happened to her.</p> <p>Edgard suggested they check her favorite local haunts and the silent drive through the snow-covered county roads proved fruitless, as did the scan of the diner, the feed store, all three of the town\u2019s honky-tonks. Trevor was half-afraid Chassie\u2019d hit the interstate for Denver and the comfort of her cousin Keely McKay.</p><p>As much as Trevor liked Keely, she was the dead last person he trusted with the secret of his past with Edgard. He suspected hotheaded Keely would suggest Chassie dump Trevor and move on. Then Trevor realized if Chassie hadn\u2019t gone to Keely, his phone call would tip Keely off something was up between them.</p><p>So he did nothing. Worried sick about his wife, he\u2019d tried not to punch holes in the wall to mark his hourly frustration.</p><p>\u201cTrevor? You still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He stalked to the window and glared into the inky darkness. \u201cTo be honest I don\u2019t know where the hell Chassie is. I\u2019m goin\u2019 fuckin\u2019 crazy, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath, buddy. She\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s heart rate doubled. \u201cChass is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Channing said she\u2019d been here most of the day, talkin\u2019 to her and playin\u2019 with my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, that\u2019s good news.\u201d He pressed his forehead to the cold glass and closed his eyes. \u201cThank God she\u2019s okay.\u201d His stomach pitched. \u201cShe is okay, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. She\u2019s seriously fucked up about you and Edgard.\u201d</p><p>His sick feeling intensified. \u201cShe told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else was she gonna go to? Chassie\u2019s hurtin\u2019 big time. Why the fuck didn\u2019t you come clean with her when Ed first showed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Liar. You didn\u2019t tell her because you were afraid this\u2019d happen; she\u2019d leave you. \u201cI thought maybe...\u201d</p><p>Colby snarled, \u201cMaybe? I\u2019m pretty goddamn sure you knew exactly what\u2019d happen with you and Ed, no maybe about it. It sucks that Channing and I had to fill in the blanks about personal shit that should\u2019ve come from you. Should\u2019ve come from you a helluva long time before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t fuckin\u2019 know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think you don\u2019t know which way is up when you get within a foot of that Brazilian, not to mention not havin\u2019 a fuckin\u2019 clue as to what to do about this situation with your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what I should do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan up.\u201d</p><p>Trevor snorted. \u201cMan up? For Christsake, what kind of bullshit advice is that, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it plain as day. Forget about livin\u2019 up to anyone\u2019s expectations or ideals but your own. Do the right thing for the first time in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggestin\u2019 I...let her go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just sayin\u2019 it\u2019s an option if you ain\u2019t got the balls to admit what you really want to her or to Ed. I\u2019d rather see her heartbroken and able to move on, than miserable, livin\u2019 a fuckin\u2019 lie. Your lie, not hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothin\u2019. I\u2019m done talkin\u2019. She\u2019s comin\u2019 home tomorrow. You\u2019d better be ready to deal with this, \u2019cause we both know it\u2019s been hangin\u2019 over your head for years.\u201d Colby hung up.</p><p>With deliberate care Trevor closed the phone. He didn\u2019t move, just watched his hot breath leave jagged patches of steam on the cold windowpane. He sensed Edgard behind him, even when Edgard didn\u2019t utter a sound.</p><p>Finally Trevor turned around.</p><p>Edgard retreated, keeping a healthy space between them, his gaze somber. \u201cShe\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and saw Edgard\u2019s posture relax.</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess she asked Channing a buncha questions. Played with Gib all day.\u201d He smiled faintly. \u201cChass does love babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe mentioned wanting a brood of her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did she tell you that?\u201d</p><p>Edgard shrugged. \u201cBefore you get bent out of shape, I\u2019ll remind you I\u2019ve hung out with Chassie a lot in the last two weeks. Way more than I have with you.\u201d His gaze searched Trevor\u2019s face. \u201cWhat else did Colby say about...?\u201d</p><p>Trevor narrowed his eyes. \u201cAbout us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, about the situation, because it hasn\u2019t been about \u2018us\u2019 since you met Chassie, regardless if I was here or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are here now. And I hope you ain\u2019t suggestin\u2019 that your showin\u2019 up out of the blue had nothin\u2019 to do with Chassie takin\u2019 off today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want, Trevor? For me to admit fault?\u201d</p><p>Dammit all to hell, he\u2019d gotten trapped by the pain in Edgard\u2019s eyes once again. He shook his head.</p><p>Edgard sighed. \u201cIf I would\u2019ve stayed in Brazil this wouldn\u2019t have happened. But you cannot stand there and tell me that this situation is one-sided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kissed me, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDistinctly.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s cheeks heated. \u201cWhat was I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPush me back with disgust. Knock me on my ass. Scream that I\u2019m a perverted fucker.\u201d Edgard threw up his hands. \u201cJesus. You should\u2019ve threatened me. Become enraged by the insult that I imagined even for the slightest moment you might like fucking me. Demanded I get the hell away from you and never come back. But you didn\u2019t do any of those things.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t. God help me, I didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cWould you have acted angry and offended if you\u2019d known your wife was watching us?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cAre you sorry I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know.</p><p>Edgard rubbed the heel of his hand on his forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t answer. I don\u2019t know if I could stand it if the answer was yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me you were prepared for my rejection from the minute you showed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Trevor wanted to shake the answers out of him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d already lost everything in my life that mattered to me, so I stupidly thought I had nothin\u2019 else to lose by coming here.\u201d Those golden eyes flickered. \u201cI was wrong. So very, very wrong. Pointless to discuss now. I\u2019m goin\u2019 to bed though I doubt I\u2019ll get a lick of sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ed. you can\u2019t drop that on me and walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d Edgard ducked through the kitchen doorway. The stairs creaked without pause and his bedroom door locked with a click of finality.</p><p>The house was silent. Trevor had never felt more confused or alone.</p><p>The sun\u2019s pinkish rays lit the horizon, ending Trevor\u2019s night of tossing and turning.</p><p>No need to dress since he\u2019d slept in his clothes. Half a pot of coffee later, he headed out to do chores.</p><p>When he returned to the house, Edgard sat at the kitchen table. The man always looked damn fine in the morning, freshly showered, wearing clean, crisply ironed clothes, his cheeks and jaw shaved smooth as a baby\u2019s butt, a spring in his step and a sparkle in his eye. Annoying, really.</p><p>But today Edgard looked a little worse for the wear. Dark circles emphasized his tired eyes, stubble coated his angular face, and he wore the same clothes as yesterday. He mumbled into his coffee cup. Edgard\u2019s usual chipper self must\u2019ve slept in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s Meridian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need done this morning?\u201d Edgard blasted Trevor with a warning look.</p> <p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t say nothin\u2019. It\u2019d be an insult to Chassie because I know she works her ass off before noon.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? Ed was being protective of his wife? \u201cI already fed the cattle.\u201d</p><p>Edgard lifted a brow. \u201cThis early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChassie didn\u2019t call?\u201d</p> <p>Trevor shook his head. \u201cThought I\u2019d get all my shit done early so we\u2019d have time to talk when she comes home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan. Where were you off to?\u201d</p><p>To pine over another thing I can\u2019t have in my life.</p><p>Jesus. That sounded pathetic. Trevor twisted a version of the truth. \u201cOur neighbor to the south is thinkin\u2019 about sellin\u2019 his place. He\u2019s given us first shot at it. Still hush-hush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it there are other folks who\u2019d want that piece of land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few. Kind of an Old West code, if you like your neighbors, you offer it to them first. But it ain\u2019t like we\u2019d get it cut rate. Gus\u2019s usin\u2019 the money to live off for the rest of his life, so I got no interest in screwin\u2019 him out of a fair deal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if Chass and I can afford the down payment, say nothin\u2019 of the buyout price.\u201d Embarrassed, Trevor scowled. \u201cThought I\u2019d head over and see how he\u2019s doin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>Edgard smiled. \u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so hard.\u201d</p><p>Rather than step in another nest of snakes, Trevor snagged his coat and headed outside.</p><p>Once they were in the truck, Edgard asked, \u201cWho\u2019re the other neighbors who could meet the asking price?\u201d</p><p>Trevor threw it in reverse and gunned the engine. \u201cThat\u2019s what sucks. Gus\u2019s neighbors on his south end are the McKays.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cColby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcKay is McKay around here. Their massive ranch crosses the borders of several counties and employs the sons and cousins and a half dozen or so ranch hands. Buyin\u2019 that acreage is a fart in a windstorm for them. But for Chass and me, it\u2019d be a way to guarantee we can make a go of it.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>He could feel Edgard\u2019s gaze burning into him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow soon does Gus need a guarantee you have the funds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m aimin\u2019 to find out today.\u201d</p><p>Edgard nodded and went silent again.</p><p>Gus Dutton\u2019s place had gone to seed in the years since his wife passed on and his offspring decided they were too good to ranch in Wyoming. Still, Trevor couldn\u2019t imagine why Gus\u2019d move to the desert to be with those ingrates.</p><p>Gus ambled onto the sagging porch and hobbled down the steps. \u201cMornin\u2019, Trevor.</p><p>Where\u2019s the missus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeddin\u2019 shower in Wheatland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity. She\u2019s a mite easier on the eyes than you are.\u201d He jerked a thumb to Edgard.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my old ropin\u2019 partner, Ed Mancuso. Ed, this is the orneriest coot in the county. Which was why he and Harland West were such good buds.\u201d</p><p>Edgard thrust out his hand. \u201cNice to meetcha, Gus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA roper, eh? You any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed to be. I ain\u2019t competing any more. But them rope skills do come in handy on the range.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear ya,\u201d Gus said. \u201cSo what brings ya by, Trevor?\u201d He rubbed his gnarled hands together in exaggerated glee. \u201cGot earnest money for me?\u201d</p><p>Trevor grinned even when his face felt encased in plastic. \u201cCome on, Gus. You were married for a helluva lot longer than me. Chassie\u2019s the one with the checkbook.\u201d</p><p>Gus grinned at him. \u201cAlways knew that pretty little gal was the smartest of the West lot.\u201d Gus focused his rheumy eyes on Edgard. \u201cYou a rancher around these parts too, now that you ain\u2019t travelin\u2019 the circuit no more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>Gus squinted suspiciously at Edgard. \u201cWhere\u2019d you say you was from again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say, but Ed\u2019s been livin\u2019 on his ranch in Brazil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrazil, as in South America?\u201d</p><p>Edgard scowled. \u201cWell, more specifically\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014specifically he was born right here in Wyoming,\u201d Trevor interjected and relayed the sad tale of Edgard\u2019s mother and father and his family connection.</p><p>02</p><p>Gus was appropriately wide-eyed. \u201cHell, boy, why didn\u2019t you say you was related to the Bordens out by Cloud Peak? I knew your grandpa and your grandma. Good people.</p><p>Your last name ain\u2019t Borden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. My stepfather adopted me when he and my mother had their first child, so I\u2019d have the same name as my siblings. My middle name is Borden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough. Now you fellas wanna take a look around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it wouldn\u2019t be too much trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo trouble a\u2019tall. We\u2019ll take your rig, Trevor, that way I can point out the interestin\u2019 stuff to Ed.\u201d</p><p>The tension mounted in Trevor\u2019s truck when Edgard slid into the middle of the cab, right next to him, with Gus on the outside. To make matters worse, the stick shift was centered on the floor so Edgard had to straddle it, putting one foot on Trevor\u2019s side and one on the passenger\u2019s side.</p><p>Edgard scooted in, leaving about a foot between them.</p><p>\u201cMove in,\u201d Gus instructed. \u201cI need a little extra room to stretch my bum leg out.\u201d</p><p>The truck bounced as Gus hoisted himself in and Edgard\u2019s left thigh pressed Trevor\u2019s right leg.</p><p>\u201cAh. Much better, huh?\u201d</p><p>Trevor turned his head the same time Edgard did. His eyes locked on those full lips.</p><p>Dammit. Edgard\u2019s mouth was so close he could smell his sweet-coffee breath. His gaze traveled up the line of Edgard\u2019s nose and connected with yellow-brown eyes.</p><p>There it was. That jolt of something deeper than lust.</p><p>\u201cWe goin\u2019 or what?\u201d Gus demanded.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re goin\u2019,\u201d Trevor said, breaking the moment. Putting the stick shift in gear, right between Edgard\u2019s legs, Trevor\u2019s fingers brushed close enough to feel the heat drifting from the crotch of Edgard\u2019s jeans.</p><p>They were going all right. Straight into the mouth of temptation. And just Trevor\u2019s luck; this time he was in the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>Don\u2019t get a hard-on. Don\u2019t get a hard-on.</p><p>But with Trevor\u2019s muscular thigh rubbing against his, and the almost constant necessity for Trevor to shift, Edgard fought a losing battle. His cock was so sensitive he feared Trevor\u2019s palm on his crotch would send him over the edge.</p><p>\u201cSee that?\u201d Gus said. \u201cUsed to be a stock dam. So dry the whole damn thing dried up.\u201d He chuckled at his own joke.</p><p>\u201cWhere else do you have water?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cMiller\u2019s Creek. Snakes through the canyon, but there\u2019s a couple flat places the cattle can get to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the same creek run through Chassie\u2019s and your place?\u201d</p><p>Trevor shook his head. \u201cOur stock dams are about in the same sad shape. We do have a natural spring, which means we don\u2019t hafta haul as much water, but no creek frontage.\u201d</p><p>An additional water source would be worth the price of the land. Edgard knew out in the high plains desert, access to fresh water was a higher commodity than gold. No wonder the McKays were so hot to have it.</p><p>\u201cHey, swing by the old homeplace, would ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown that embankment. Whoa. Right. Hard right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Hang on.\u201d Trevor cranked the wheel, which sent Edgard crashing into him with enough force he had to brace his hand on Trevor\u2019s thigh.</p><p>Gus was too busy laughing to notice Trevor\u2019s surprised gasp.</p><p>Don\u2019t squeeze that firm thigh. Don\u2019t do it.</p><p>Edgard briefly let his fingers trace the inside crease of Trevor\u2019s jeans as he pushed off to return to his own space.</p><p>The simple move seemed to rattle Trevor.</p><p>But Gus was running off at the mouth again so the moment was short lived.</p><p>For the next two hours the trio bumped across the frozen ground. Each directional shift sent them careening into each other, and if Edgard could believe his eyes, the zipper on Trevor\u2019s jeans bulged more than normal.</p><p>As much as Edgard would love to pretend the feel of half of Trevor\u2019s body rubbing against his, whether accidental or on purpose, was foreplay, it wasn\u2019t. And he\u2019d do his part to keep Trevor\u2019s promise to Chassie even if it damn near killed him.</p><p>\u201cSo whatcha think of my place, Ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I say I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d wanna live anywhere else, Trevor and Chassie would both shoot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t an answer,\u201d Gus pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Edgard grinned. \u201cBut it\u2019s the best you\u2019re gonna get outta me, Gus.\u201d</p><p>Back at the ranch, while Trevor used the bathroom, Edgard finagled the answers he needed from Gus on a couple of things.</p><p>Then they were off, on their way home.</p><p>Finally Trevor said, \u201cGus is old school. But I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t ask you more questions about your operation in Brazil. He lives for shit like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t as interesting as it sounds. Ranching is pretty much the same world over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you two talkin\u2019 about when I came back outside?\u201d</p><p>Edgard shrugged, not willing to divulge anything yet. \u201cJust shooting the breeze. He has an opinion on everything and needed to share it with me. I figure he\u2019s pretty lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reckon. He and Agnes were married for sixty years, so I can\u2019t fathom why he\u2019d leave this place and never look back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems his decision will work out good for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trevor snorted. \u201cIf we can convince the banker we\u2019re a good risk.\u201d</p><p>Edgard drummed his fingers on his knee. \u201cWould you consider asking your family for the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no. I ain\u2019t gonna be beholden to my pa for nothin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven if it means letting the McKays have the land?\u201d</p><p>Trevor brooded. Fiddled with the radio station. Messed with the heating system vents. Finally he sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Askin\u2019 Tater would be a last resort. It sucks ass.\u201d</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be a last resort for me. I\u2019d love to suck your ass.</p><p>Great. He\u2019d finally managed to get rid of his hard-on only to stir it up again with that debauched visual. He shifted uncomfortably. \u201cWho\u2019s helping run your dad\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother Brent. Such a kiss up. I never liked him. Pa knew it, which was why he put Brent in charge when I threatened to leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThreatened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld bastard didn\u2019t think I\u2019d do it. When he pulled that \u2018I\u2019m cuttin\u2019 you out of the co-op\u2019 threat, I called his bluff. Told him to do whatever he wanted. Brent took over, so I left.\u201d The corners of his mouth twitched. \u201cBut not before I knocked that pussy on his fat ass.\u201d</p><p>Edgard laughed.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t been back since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo contact with anyone at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinimal. My other brother is on the circuit. Brent will do whatever Dad tells him to do. My sisters and their freeloadin\u2019 husbands are just as bad. So I figure I ain\u2019t out much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey know Chassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout her? Yeah. Met her yet? Hell no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I ain\u2019t a big fan of your family, but that seems...odd.\u201d</p><p>The muscle in Trevor\u2019s jaw bulged. \u201cMy asshole father called me, drunk as shit, and announced I\u2019d dropped to the bottom of the peckin\u2019 order, except he called it the \u2018totem pole\u2019, when I married a red-skinned...shit, I can\u2019t even repeat it.\u201d His hands curled around the steering wheel. \u201cChassie heard.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s stomach dropped. \u201cOh, Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTater Glanzer can be a dickhead to me all he wants, \u2019cause I\u2019m used to his meanness. But when he brought my sweet wife into it? He went too far. Even if he was drunk off his ass and probably don\u2019t remember nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand why you\u2019d stay away from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you? I thought your family was all rainbows and butterflies and I\u2019m-okay-you\u2019re-okay happy shit.\u201d</p> <p>Trevor turned off the main road and they started up the long driveway.</p><p>\u201cMaybe at one time. Things change.\u201d Sadness, anger and grief spun in Edgard\u2019s head. Here was his chance to come clean with Trevor about what\u2019d gone down in his life in the last year. \u201cSometimes things change one helluva lot. Sometimes leaving is the only option.\u201d</p><p>He braced himself for Trevor\u2019s questions, but the man kept his eyes forward and he knew why Trevor hadn\u2019t responded. Chassie\u2019s truck was parked in front of the house.</p><p>Trevor barely put it in park before he jumped out of the truck and barreled up the steps into the house.</p><p>Edgard stared at the aluminum screen door and listened to the engine clicking as the motor cooled. \u201cSometimes leaving is the only option,\u201d he repeated, knowing saying it out loud didn\u2019t make it any easier to do.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>The door banged open. Chassie turned just in time to see Trevor running\u2014 running\u2014</p><p>toward her.</p><p>He swept her into his arms, peppered her face with kisses, muttering, \u201cThank God you\u2019re home. I missed you. Baby, I missed you so damn much. Don\u2019t ever leave me again.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped herself around him and held on. Breathing him in. Listening to his heart thundering beneath her ear. Renewing her vow to do whatever it took to keep this man she loved in her life forever.</p><p>Trevor said not one word; his actions spoke volumes. His palms smoothed over her hair and down her neck. Hands followed the contours of her shoulders, her spine, the curve of her hips and the globes of her ass, then his fingers trailed back up, starting the process all over again. Feelings of love, reverence, hope, possession, apology, passion, fear, need...all there solely in his touch.</p><p>A shuddering wiggle of her body caused Trevor to drop his arms as if he feared he\u2019d been crowding her.</p><p>Chassie rose up on her tiptoes and brushed kisses on the sexy cleft in his chin. Once.</p><p>Twice. Three times. Her lips meandered up to his mouth, where she whispered, \u201cI missed you too,\u201d and she devoured him in a bruising kiss.</p><p>Trevor let her lead for a change and it felt damn good. She dragged hot, openmouthed kisses down the strong column of his throat, loving the way he tasted there, loving the scent of his sweat and really loving his soft, helpless groan when her tongue touched a sweet spot at the base of his neck.</p><p>\u201cChassie, we need to\u2014ouch!\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved into a smile after she\u2019d bitten him.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him innocently. \u201cWhat? That little love bite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle? Christ, woman, I think you drew blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby.\u201d Chassie kissed the red mark. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019ll happen every time you try to talk. I don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened. She half-expected Trevor to jump back (with guilt?) but he didn\u2019t move. She pressed her lips to the other mark before she spun around.</p><p>Edgard paused on the rug.</p><p>What was he waiting for?</p><p>For you to prove you don\u2019t have a gun aimed at his head for being in love with your husband. Make the first move.</p><p>\u201cHey, Edgard.\u201d</p><p>His smile was warm, lighting up his entire face. When the glow reached his eyes, the hazel tones were transformed into a mellow gold. \u201cHey, Chass.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but return that beautiful smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>Trevor didn\u2019t speak. He appeared to have quit breathing.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d Edgard looked at Trevor. \u201cMight I borrow the truck for a little while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you goin\u2019?\u201d Chassie asked as Trevor tossed the keys over.</p><p>\u201cI want to check on my pickup in person and light a fire under them to get going on repairs.\u201d He shifted his stance. \u201cThere are a couple other things I need to do before I leave town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave?\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s gaze zipped to Trevor, but Trevor kept his focus on Chassie. \u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we need to sit down and talk tonight. All three of us, before there\u2019s any serious talk of leavin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>After a long pause, Edgard nodded. The door shut with a soft click.</p><p>Without another word, Chassie hooked her finger in Trevor\u2019s belt loop and towed him upstairs to their bedroom. She locked the door and leaned against it.</p><p>Her take-charge husband stood in the middle of the room like he was facing a firing squad.Trevor\u2019s pale blue eyes were wary, his normally full lips flattened in a thin line.</p><p>Jaw clenched, neck muscles tight, even Trevor\u2019s broad shoulders were hunched almost to his ears. He jammed his hands in the front pockets of the dirty jeans he wore. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrip.\u201d</p><p>Trevor opened his mouth, reconsidered and snapped it shut. He doffed his clothes quickly.</p><p>\u201cLie on the bed. On your back. Close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>He rolled down her grandmother\u2019s star quilt. The bed creaked and a buck-ass nekkid Trevor stretched out on the sheets without complaint.</p><p>Chassie undressed and crawled on top of Trevor so they were skin-to-skin. Back to basics, nothing between them but breath and bones. Shuddering heat rolled off him, not solely from desire, but from relief. She rested her head on his chest, situating herself so the sharper planes of her body wouldn\u2019t injure any of his vital parts.</p><p>After a minute, he circled his arms around her. She didn\u2019t chide him for his presumption; she took comfort in the feel of his body against hers from head to toe.</p><p>Despite their combined body heat, her skin cooled quickly. When she shivered, Trevor shifted and pulled the quilt up over both of them. Even beneath the covers his fingers lightly stroked her back. Like he couldn\u2019t touch her enough.</p><p>Chassie\u2019s eyes drifted shut. She floated into sleep; his muted whispers in her hair a sweet lullaby.</p><p>She awoke disoriented. The shadows and light in her bedroom indicated afternoon, not morning. Had she overslept?</p><p>Callused fingertips skated up her arm.</p><p>Chassie lifted her head and stared into Trevor\u2019s sleepy blue eyes. \u201cWhoa. Time warp. How long was I asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I drifted off right after you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been awake?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cLong enough to come up with a plan to seduce my very sexy wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what they say about the best laid plans...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaid bein\u2019 the word I can work with, bein\u2019s we\u2019re both nekkid.\u201d</p><p>She trapped his hips between her knees and dangled on all fours above him. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want your seduction.\u201d</p><p>The pulse in his neck jumped. \u201cAh. Okay. I\u2019m willin\u2019 to wait until you\u2019re ready...to talk or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because you were startin\u2019 to piss me off, Trev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Chassie lowered her face until their lips were a hair apart. \u201cMaybe there ain\u2019t any seduction involved. Maybe I just wanna be a little mean. Maybe I want sex on my terms.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s loud groan disappeared as she thrust her tongue into his warm mouth, licking at every inch until that\u2019s all she could taste\u2014Trevor on her lips, rolling over her tongue, flowing down the back of her throat, filling her up.</p><p>When his arms moved, she expected he\u2019d latch onto her shoulders and flip her to her back. She anticipated fighting him. Being forceful and more than a little harsh appealed immensely, but those strong hands gently cradled her face and Chassie was lost in his tenderness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yet, Trevor wasn\u2019t completely passive. His cock bumped against her belly, leaving a slick, intimate kiss. The muscles on his body\u2019s lower half were tensed, primed and ready for action. She did the unexpected and rubbed her toes down the outside of his calves.</p><p>His upper body bowed off the bed. Trevor\u2019s breathing was decidedly ragged as his lust-filled blue gaze caught hers.</p><p>Chassie pressed a moist kiss to the vulnerable spot below his ear. When goose bumps broke out across his flesh, she did it again. And again. Breathing on the spot until Trevor could scarcely lay still. She zigzagged her tongue over the curve and hollows, stopping to nibble on corded tendons.</p> <p>Still hanging above him, she shimmied backward and kissed the dark blond trail arrowing the way to her destination. She didn\u2019t detour to tease his nipples. She didn\u2019t plunge the tip of her tongue into his belly button. Or nip the tender skin between his hipbones; she kept a southward progression.</p><p>\u201cChassie. Baby. You don\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>She angled her head, placed her teeth on the inside of his left thigh, and bit. Hard.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do a matching one on the other side if you wanna keep talkin\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cGood. Watch me.\u201d</p><p>Chassie licked up the length of his shaft.</p><p>He hissed.</p><p>She poised her lips at the weeping tip. Her tongue darted out and circled the plump head. She felt the slick pre-come on her tongue, but didn\u2019t taste it. Just let the wetness build\u2014hers, his\u2014until her mouth was watering. Then she swallowed his cock in one smooth, deep gulp.</p><p>Trevor\u2019s hands fisted into the sheets and he bit his lip to stop from crying out. Or from swearing like a sailor, as she sucked and deep throated him exactly as he liked it.</p> <p>Having his cock in her mouth always made her wet and ready. Although this foreplay was minimal, she didn\u2019t want to wait. Chassie scooted up, aligned her sex to his and sheathed his cock to the root.</p><p>\u201cUh, ah,\u201d burst from his mouth instead of words.</p><p>Her palms were flat on the mattress by his head and his hands were still clenched in the sheets. She put her lips on his ear. \u201cTrevor. Touch me.\u201d</p><p>Immediately those working-man hands she loved were on her shoulders and sliding down her back.</p><p>A shiver of desire prompted her to move on him, a gradual push until that stiff organ was buried deep. A side-to-side grind teased her clit perfectly, a slow slide as that male hardness eased out.</p><p>He said gruffly, \u201cKiss me while you\u2019re lovin\u2019 on me, Chass. Please.\u201d</p><p>She rocked on him slow and easy; the kiss was languid and sweet. They were adrift in the pleasure of the friction of damp bodies, the gentle creaking of the old bed, the familiar scent of skin and sex and body-warmed cotton sheets.</p><p>When Trevor\u2019s body tightened beneath hers, he broke the kiss. She gloried in hearing her name repeated on his lips as his pelvis arched, bathing her insides with heat. As she bore down, prolonging his orgasm, prolonging the moment when he belonged only to her, her own release tumbled her straight into the abyss with him.</p> <p>Keeping their intimate connection, she nestled against him and closed her eyes.</p><p>They might\u2019ve dozed. They might\u2019ve fallen into the blank space where lover\u2019s time is static.</p><p>Trevor kissed the top of her head. \u201cYou warmed up now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>He whispered huskily, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>Chassie lifted her head from the warm haven of Trevor\u2019s chest. \u201cYes, I do. You loving me is not the issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured.\u201d Trevor tugged on her braid, wrapping the thickness around his palm. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep much last night. I wandered up here and went right back downstairs to crash on the couch.\u201d He smooched her wrinkled brow. \u201cAlone. I couldn\u2019t stand that you weren\u2019t here. It was like part of me was gone. I\u2019ve never been so goddamn happy to see your piece of shit truck as I was when we pulled up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet talker. Where were you guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe headed over to Gus\u2019s to take another look. Don\u2019t know why the hell I torture myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told Edgard about us wanting to expand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Asked his opinion. Come to find out Gus knew Ed\u2019s grandparents.\u201d</p><p>Chassie kept her expression neutral. The bit about Wyoming being rife with coincidence and everyone knowing everyone else wasn\u2019t as unusual as closed-mouthed Trevor discussing their private business with Edgard. \u201cWhat was Edgard\u2019s take on the land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind any way to buy it. Even if it means borrowin\u2019 from my pa.\u201d Trevor scowled. \u201cI doubt the old man would consider a short-term loan, even when I know damn good and well he\u2019s lent my siblings money to build their places. I\u2019m almost scared if I tell Pa what the money is for, he\u2019ll suck up to Gus and buy it right out from under me, just so he can fuck up my life.\u201d</p><p>That statement wasn\u2019t Trevor being paranoid. From what he\u2019d told her, Chassie wouldn\u2019t put any dirty, nasty trick past Tater Glanzer when it came to getting the upper hand on his offspring.</p><p>\u201cBut, it don\u2019t matter none, \u2019cause unless you\u2019ve hidden a winnin\u2019 lottery ticket someplace, we\u2019re fucked. Ain\u2019t no way we can come up with the down payment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrev. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it ain\u2019t.\u201d A bitter snort stirred her hair. \u201cI\u2019m some great catch, ain\u2019t I? Never made enough from rodeoin\u2019 to buy more\u2019n a lousy horse trailer. I\u2019m livin\u2019 on your ranch.</p><p>I can\u2019t find the money to buy Gus\u2019s acreage. And my former partner\u2014no less than a male lover\u2014shows up and you realize I\u2019ve kept a pretty goddamn big secret from you. Hell, Chass, maybe Colby was right. Maybe you are better off without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in so many words.\u201d</p><p>Chassie placed her hand over his mouth. \u201cThis ranch isn\u2019t mine; it\u2019s ours. You\u2019ve cared more in the last two years than either Dag or Dad did in the last twenty years. This is our home, where we get to make the rules. Yeah, I\u2019d like to have Gus\u2019s land, but if we don\u2019t get it, then we weren\u2019t meant to have it. All things happen for a reason.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a considering look. \u201cDo you really believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Just think, if you hadn\u2019t filled in on the circuit as Dag\u2019s partner, we wouldn\u2019t have met. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep the ranch by myself after Dag and Dad both died. So after we got married this place became ours. And havin\u2019 you in my life is worth way more than any piece of land.\u201d</p><p>Trevor kissed her. \u201cAnd you wonder why I love you so damn much.\u201d His eyes flickered to the window. \u201cAnd what about Edgard showin\u2019 up? You think that happened for a reason? You haven\u2019t changed your mind about my worth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna lie, it knocked me for a loop.\u201d She managed a small smile. \u201cMight sound stupid, but yeah, there is some cosmic reason Ed showed up now. I\u2019m workin\u2019 on understandin\u2019, Trev. I really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I can ask.\u201d He kissed her again, and gently separated their bodies. He sat on the edge of the bed and looked over his shoulder. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you laze in bed a bit longer? Get some shut-eye and I\u2019ll finish a couple things.\u201d He dressed and slipped out of the room.</p><p>Chassie snuggled beneath the covers and was glad to be home, even if everything in her life, all her perceptions and misconceptions about love were about to change dramatically, whether she was ready for it or not.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>A spicy aroma greeted her as she entered the kitchen. \u201cThat smells great.\u201d</p><p>Edgard turned. \u201cHope you don\u2019t mind me taking over your kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind? I hope you don\u2019t mind if I lay a big, wet, sloppy kiss on you for fixin\u2019 supper.\u201d</p><p>A strangely hopeful look flickered in his eyes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind that at all.\u201d</p><p>Before she lost her nerve, she walked over to him and kissed his cheek. \u201cThank you.</p><p>Trevor has a lot of great qualities, but cookin\u2019 ain\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he wow you with his chili? Or his recipe for cowboy beans, which actually is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChili,\u201d they said in unison, and then laughed in unison.</p><p>\u201cNeedless to say I do all the cookin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Why?\u201d</p><p>Edgard shrugged. \u201cBecause in this day and age lots of men cook. I like to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you always cooked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother made sure I knew the basics and I took it from there. I lived by myself and it was either learn to cook, or I\u2019d be eating spaghetti, chili and frozen burritos forever.\u201d He shot her a considering look. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer the norm around here? Sticking to those old gender roles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. See, it\u2019s not that Trev and I are stickin\u2019 to traditional roles in this marriage, but I\u2019m better in the kitchen than he is. I don\u2019t mind, since I can\u2019t fix machinery worth a damn.\u201d Chassie peered at the pan on the stove. \u201cBut if you tell me that\u2019s a pot of chili, I\u2019m gonna brain you with the lid.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s not. It\u2019s Brazilian style stew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is, it smells damn good. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Trevor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad to help Gus with something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Chassie glanced at the clock. Her nap had lasted longer than she\u2019d expected because it was almost five o\u2019clock. \u201cWould you like a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re having one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Chassie planned on having a whole lotta beer. She definitely needed alcohol to get the conversation started and probably an entire case to follow through with her plan. She took two bottles of Bud Light from the door and passed one to him. Snick, hiss, pop echoed, as the lids were untwisted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Edgard\u2019s backside rested against one counter; hers on the one across from him. She gulped her beer, cautioning herself to be tactful and calm, but what burst forth from her mouth was, \u201cAre you in love with my husband?\u201d</p><p>He visibly paled. And knocked back an equally big swallow of Budweiser in lieu of answering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard Trevor\u2019s side. I talked to Channing and to Colby. So that leaves you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if I say yes, Chassie? What then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally thinkin\u2019 we have a gunfight in the street to determine who\u2019s tough enough to win Trevor\u2019s affections,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>That brought a slight smile. \u201cYou are a smartass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are avoidin\u2019 the question, amigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, do you know how hard it is to look at you and answer that question?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo harder than it is to look you in the eye and ask it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d Edgard picked at the label. \u201cDo I love him? That\u2019s what I came here to figure out. Or if I\u2019d given so much importance to the memory of him\u2014to the memory of us\u2014that I wasn\u2019t able to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019d somehow...glorified your past?\u201d</p><p>Edgard nodded. \u201cI seemed to remember only the good times. And because we weren\u2019t public about our relationship, there were plenty of bad times.\u201d</p><p>Chassie inhaled a slow breath. \u201cThis ain\u2019t me bein\u2019 cruel, but I hafta ask. Did you honestly believe he\u2019d take you home to meet his folks and you\u2019d settle down on a little ranch, just the two of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Edgard let the bottle dangle between his fingers and repeated, \u201cNo. Never.</p> <p>That\u2019s one of the reasons I left. I realized Trevor could never be for me what I needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that another reason why you\u2019re here? To see if I\u2019m enough for him??\u201d</p><p>Those honey-brown eyes met hers. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you come to a conclusion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even fucking close. I\u2019m more confused than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d</p><p>Silence stretched as they pretended to drink their beer.</p><p>Finally Chassie broke. \u201cI told Channing it\u2019d be easier if I hated you.\u201d</p> <p>Edgard studied her. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t hate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Are you shocked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually like you.\u201d She swigged from the bottle. \u201cAin\u2019t that a kick in the ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re even on that account, because there\u2019s something mighty likeable about you, little Chassie.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cLittle.\u201d Then she drained her beer and slammed the empty on the table, avoiding his gaze. \u201cJesus, it sounds stupid in my head, and it\u2019ll sound even dumber when I say it out loud. But I can see why Trevor was drawn to you.\u201d</p><p>Edgard stiffened up.</p><p>His defensive posture made her blurt out, \u201cIt ain\u2019t only that GQ cover model face and smokin\u2019 hot body you\u2019ve got goin\u2019 on. You are like him in so many ways. Yet so different. You complement him. Not in the same way I do. And that doesn\u2019t seem like such a bad thing. And I can\u2019t believe I even think that, let alone said it.\u201d</p><p>The air crackled with tension.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t helping clear up my confusion, Chassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a flying fig if it is or not. It needed to be said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot anything else that needs to be said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen spit it out.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. She didn\u2019t know if she could.</p><p>The dryer buzzed in the cellar.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Chassie shook her head, hating how the demand wrapped within his silken command caused her heart to pound faster.</p><p>Then Edgard was in her space. His hand cupped her jaw, forcing her head up. \u201cYou do not get to drop that bomb and then pretend you didn\u2019t light the fuse as you\u2019re standing there holding the match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat fits, because I feel like I\u2019m walking through a goddamn minefield when it comes to this. None of this makes sense. You\u2019re in love with my husband and despite those warning signs I could actually lose him, I\u2019m...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sorry you came.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s gentle grip increased. \u201cAre you messing with my head to get back at me because of my past with Trevor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to believe that all of a sudden you just accept...\u201d His eyes burned with suspicion. \u201cI see the lie in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you see is insecurity and determination to see this conversation through, but not a goddamn lie because I\u2019m bein\u2019 completely honest with you. And myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with Trevor? Does he know you intended to start this conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Didn\u2019t it come up during pillow talk after you spent all afternoon fucking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d she taunted softly.</p><p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t fucking believe.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in her eyes. \u201cStop. You\u2019re hurting me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s hand dropped like it\u2019d become dead weight.</p><p>Chassie wilted against the counter. Blood pulsing. Vision blurring. Confusion screaming in her head.</p><p>Several brutal seconds passed.</p><p>His eyes focused on where her fingers rubbed on her jawline. \u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me see it.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her hand.</p><p>He winced. \u201cShit. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Jesus. Looks like Trevor ain\u2019t the only one with a mean streak. You\u2019ve been nothin\u2019 but sweet and thoughtful to me since the minute I arrived. And how do I repay you when you have the cajones to confront me about all this confusing shit?\u201d His rough finger traced the hot, sore spot. \u201cBy manhandling you.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach flipped at his gentle touch.</p><p>Edgard murmured, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, querida, so very, very sorry. Sometimes I can be a total ass. I\u2019d say I learned it from Trevor, but I think he learned it from me.\u201d His warm lips skated over her jawbone in a teasing, soft kiss meant to soothe, meant as a sweet apology.</p><p>If it was just an apologetic kiss, why did her skin tingle? Why did her pulse beat like a trapped bird\u2019s? Why did she consider angling her throat, urging him to explore every ridge and hollow with those beautifully full lips?</p><p>Why in the hell didn\u2019t he stop?</p><p>And then he did. Edgard practically jumped backward.</p><p>They stared at each other in absolute uncertainty without speaking.</p><p>That\u2019s when Trevor walked in.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>Chassie snatched the empty beer bottle from the table and took it to the garbage can.</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019s goin\u2019 on.\u201d</p><p>Trevor turned to Edgard...who blinked at him innocently.</p><p>It\u2019d looked like the two of them had been about to come to blows. Over what? Him?</p><p>Maybe you\u2019re imagining it.</p><p>No. There was tension crackling between Chassie and Edgard. But if neither one would come clean, then he wasn\u2019t about to push the issue. Enough issues lingered between them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s for supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdgard cooked.\u201d She paused. \u201cChili, I think.\u201d</p><p>Chassie and Edgard exchanged a look, then burst out laughing.</p><p>Weird.</p><p>Edgard said, \u201cIt\u2019s Brazilian stew.\u201d</p><p>Trevor frowned at Ed. \u201cWhat the hell is in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever is leftover in the fridge and a can of stewed tomatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. You guys ready to eat?\u201d</p><p>Chassie pointed at the sink. \u201cSoon as you wash up. You want a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Water\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater is fine for me too.\u201d</p><p>Once the food had been dished up, they gathered around the table and ate in silence.</p><p>Trevor peeked at Chassie out of the corner of his eye. She was on her third beer, which was damn strange since she rarely drank more than one.</p><p>Edgard shoved his empty bowl to the middle of the table. \u201cI talked to the mechanic this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Trevor paused mid-bite. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be good to go day after tomorrow,\u201d Edgard said, fiddling with his napkin.</p><p>Trevor almost demanded, \u201cAlready?\u201d but he cautioned himself to stay cool. \u201cThey say how much the repairs\u2019ll run ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive hundred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><p>They talked specifics on the repairs, delving into the minute details neither of them gave a shit about, just to keep the conversation going. Just to avoid discussing what Edgard\u2019s leaving really meant.</p><p>After five or so minutes of senseless car chatter, Chassie slapped her hands on the table, startling both men. \u201cEnough. There\u2019s been enough goddamn secrets, lies, and skirting the goddamn truth. No more. We\u2019re gonna talk this through, startin\u2019 right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChass, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want Edgard to go?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Trevor\u2019s gut clenched at the thought of Ed leaving again. But how could he admit that? Out loud? To his wife? He studied the checkered tablecloth.</p><p>\u201cFine. If you can\u2019t be honest, maybe he can.\u201d Chassie focused on Edgard. \u201cDo you want to leave here? And I\u2019m not talkin\u2019 about Wyoming. I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about our home.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s gaze zipped from Chassie to Trevor and back to Chassie before he shook his head.</p><p>The tightness in Trevor\u2019s body faded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Trevor doesn\u2019t want you to go. But this conversation is over if he doesn\u2019t have the balls to admit it to you or to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Their gazes burned through him, incinerating his damn pride.

The sticky silence went on.</p><p>The furnace kicked on, breaking the still, heated air.</p><p>\u201cBizarre as it might sound, it was what I wanted to hear.\u201d Chassie finished her beer in one greedy gulp and reached for another. \u201cLet\u2019s get to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know . It.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019ve been hittin\u2019 the Bud a little hard\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?

I wanna watch you two touchin\u2019 each other. Bein\u2019 together like you used to be. As lovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d burst from Trevor\u2019s mouth before he curbed it.</p><p>\u201cChanning told me how beautiful it was watchin\u2019 you guys. I need to see it for myself. Maybe then I\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>Trevor swallowed his disbelief as he reached for Chassie\u2019s hand. He didn\u2019t speak for a bit.</p><p>A disgruntled, \u201cWhat?\u201d tumbled from her pursed lips.</p><p>\u201cYou were ready to kick me out yesterday after just seein\u2019 Ed kissin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yeah. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt made you jealous. So you think you can handle seein\u2019 what we are when we\u2019re really together? Sexually? As lovers?\u201d</p><p>Chassie looked straight at him. \u201cI want to try.\u201d</p> <p>He considered her.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t believe me, do you?\u201d</p><p>Trevor shrugged. \u201cHell, if you remember, you offered me to Ed at one point yesterday, sayin\u2019 you were done with me.\u201d</p><p>Edgard snorted softly.</p><p>A feeble smile appeared on Chassie\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThen you asked me not to be with Ed while you were gone. Which I respected.\u201d His eyes cut to Edgard. \u201cWhich we both respected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that too, Trev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how am I supposed to believe you want me to be with him now? How can I believe you ain\u2019t gonna change your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said things out of anger because I was hurt. Because it was such a shock that I didn\u2019t know anything about him or how you felt then or now.\u201d She tried to dislodge his hand but he held tight. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be a shock. You could\u2019ve told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Chassie. Telling you would\u2019ve served no purpose,\u201d Edgard said.</p><p>After Edgard spoke, her gaze zoomed to him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Trevor couldn\u2019t admit how he felt about me to me, or even to himself, what chance did he have of explaining it to you so you understood? Especially when he knew how much that declaration would hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve hurt no matter what. With all the confusing thoughts runnin\u2019 through my mind, one thing stuck out, one thing haunted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was what, baby?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cLonging. I saw it on your face. I saw it on Ed\u2019s face. I didn\u2019t understand it. But I had seen it before. Off and on since the first time we met.\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cMade me think of my brother because I\u2019d seen it on his face too goddamn many times to mention. I never knew what it meant when he\u2019d get that far off look. Now I think I do. If Dag would\u2019ve trusted me, if he would\u2019ve trusted one person in his life, one person that he didn\u2019t have to lie to, one person who would try to understand, one person who loved him no matter what he did, or who he loved, would it have made a difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but you can\u2019t beat yourself up about that, Chass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late, even when I can\u2019t go back and change the past. Not Dag\u2019s past, not the past you two shared, but I can go forward. We all can go forward. Start fresh.\u201d</p><p>Chassie opened her eyes. \u201cNeither of you used my absence last night as an excuse to be together like you both longed to.\u201d Her laugh was soft and sob-like. \u201cIt sounds crazy, but I know neither of you want to hurt me, you\u2019d rather hurt yourselves again and I can\u2019t live with that either. So seeing you two together is what I\u2019ve come up with to start. If either of you has a better idea, I\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>Edgard snatched her free hand. \u201cSo if Trevor and I are together tonight, what does that mean for tomorrow night? And the nights after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I wish I could guarantee I won\u2019t have a screaming, hissy jealous fit at seein\u2019 your hands on him, Ed. But the only thing I can promise is that for tonight, it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about you two. What you bring to each other. I won\u2019t stand in your way, I won\u2019t pass judgment. I won\u2019t participate, I\u2019ll try like hell not to interrupt. I\u2019ll just be there watching.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s eye caught Trevor\u2019s and the pure heat caused his desire to escalate and his cock to harden.</p><p>Still, Trevor held that split-second of doubt. Was Chassie doing something that\u2019d hurt her in the long run just because she knew it was what he wanted now?</p><p>The greedy part of his brain screamed, Why are you questioning her motives when she\u2019s given you a goddamn green light\u2014go go go!</p><p>\u201cYou understand if I start touchin\u2019 him tonight, I won\u2019t be able to stop.\u201d</p><p>Chassie nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Edgard softly kissed Chassie\u2019s hand and set it on the table. He stood. Before he even turned toward Trevor, Trevor was out of his chair and on him.</p><p>Their mouths met in a furious kiss. Trevor trapped Edgard\u2019s face in his hands. He inhaled Ed\u2019s whole mouth like a sumptuous feast, making up for the mere crumbs he\u2019d tasted the day before.</p><p>For the longest time they remained plastered body-to-body in a deep lip lock.</p><p>Reacquainting themselves with the urgency of long denied desire and endless, unstoppable kisses.</p><p>Edgard pulled away with a gasp, resting his forehead to Trevor\u2019s. His entire body shook. He clutched Trevor\u2019s arms as the breath sawed in and out of his lungs.</p><p>Trevor smoothed his hands over Edgard\u2019s silken hair, repeating, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted...I needed...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...I can\u2019t believe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes.\u201d He traced the shell of Edgard\u2019s ear with his thumb. \u201cI\u2019m here. We\u2019re both here.\u201d</p><p>Edgard seemed to regain control. He lifted his head and pressed his mouth to Trevor\u2019s. \u201cLet me have you first.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s belly muscles tensed with anticipation and his cock jerked against his zipper.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d Clasping their hands together, Edgard led them out of the kitchen and into the living room.</p><p>The fluorescent bulb in the ceiling bathed the room in bright white, making Trevor feel as if he\u2019d stepped from the darkness into another reality.</p><p>They stopped in the center of the room in front of the couch. Trevor heard the springs squeak a second later, but when he turned to see if Chassie had followed them, Edgard\u2019s fingers on his jaw kept him facing forward, facing only Edgard.</p><p>His gut clenched. It was impossible to look away from Edgard\u2019s triumphant eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how many times I jacked off to this fantasy? Trying to decide what I\u2019d do to you first if I ever had the chance again?\u201d</p><p>Trevor shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I rip your shirt open, sucking your nipples while I give you a handjob.\u201d</p><p>Edgard placed his lips on the side of Trevor\u2019s neck. \u201cSometimes I get your jeans down around your knees, then rub our cocks together until we both shoot on your belly. But the one I wanna fulfill now? Having your cock in my mouth.\u201d Edgard\u2019s breath drifted hot and damp over the collar of Trevor\u2019s shirt before he stepped back. \u201cClothes off.\u201d</p><p>The plain white T-shirt sailed over Trevor\u2019s head. He managed to unbuckle his belt.</p><p>His knit boxers hit the floor the same time as his jeans and he kicked them away. Last thing to go were his socks. Then Trevor stood naked in front of Edgard, his cock erect, his face flushed, waiting and wanting.</p><p>\u201cRanch work agrees with you.\u201d Edgard flattened his palms on Trevor\u2019s pecs and held them there for a second before slowly sliding his hands to Trevor\u2019s ribs, landing solidly on his hips. Amidst openmouthed kisses Edgard murmured, \u201cI wanna keep kissing you. I wanna keep touching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good with that.\u201d Trevor felt rough-tipped fingers roving down the outside of his leg and his cock twitched when Edgard dropped to his knees in front of him.</p><p>Firm male lips tickled the coarse hair on his thighs, back and forth in an erotic arc until Trevor trembled. \u201cYou like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I do.\u201d Trevor grabbed his cock with his right hand and Edgard\u2019s hair with his left, forcing Edgard to look up. Brushing the sticky cockhead over Edgard\u2019s parted lips, he said, \u201cYou wanna suck it, you\u2019re gonna suck all of it.\u201d He cupped Edgard\u2019s jaw, pushing his chin down and slid his shaft in halfway.</p><p>A moan reverberated up the length of his dick. While Edgard sucked, he slipped one hand between Trevor\u2019s legs.</p><p>Trevor withdrew, warning, \u201cNo ass play. No strokin\u2019 my balls. Mouth on my cock, hands on my thighs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen wide.\u201d His hips snapped and he was buried balls deep in that blistering wet heat. Trevor didn\u2019t move, he gave himself permission to feel. Edgard\u2019s lips stretched around the base of his cock and his tongue stroked the underside of his shaft. The warmth of Edgard\u2019s body radiating from beneath his clothes. The need to create that explosive friction had Trevor pulling back with the intention of slamming deep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Edgard wasn\u2019t ready to release him. He sank his teeth into the hard flesh just enough to keep Trevor\u2019s cock in place, digging his fingers into the tops of Trevor\u2019s thighs.</p><p>Trevor growled. He absorbed the sensations, the liquid heat surrounding his cock increased as Edgard\u2019s mouth filled with saliva.</p><p>Finally Edgard swallowed. The movement constricted the muscles around the head of his cock at the back of Edgard\u2019s throat and sent a shockwave to his balls.</p><p>\u201cChrist. Like that. Again.\u201d Trevor held perfectly still, allowing for that mouthwatering buildup as his cock throbbed.</p><p>This time Edgard swallowed with more gusto.</p><p>Trevor groaned, sliding his hand down Edgard\u2019s face, sweeping his thumb across the hollowed section of Edgard\u2019s cheek. \u201cNo more teasin\u2019 me.\u201d When Edgard\u2019s eyes glittered with that same overriding need, Trevor whispered, \u201cNot a power thing. Because I\u2019m dyin\u2019 for my turn.\u201d He pulled out slowly, prolonging the light scrape of teeth on the underside of his shaft.</p><p>\u201cHard. Hard and fast,\u201d Edgard panted. \u201cLike you used to, like you want to.\u201d</p><p>Curling his hands around Edgard\u2019s head, he yielded to lust. Every rapid, wet stroke brought him to the point of detonation. When his legs wobbled, Edgard steadied him even as that clever mouth destroyed him. His balls nearly disappeared they drew up so high and tight.</p><p>\u201cClose. Jesus. Ed. Please. God. Now.\u201d Trevor realized he had a death grip on Edgard\u2019s head and let his left hand fall to his side.</p><p>Edgard never missed a beat as he reached for Trevor\u2019s hand and threaded their fingers together, resting their joined hands on Trevor\u2019s thigh.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the raw suctioning power of Ed\u2019s eager mouth, or the wickedly accurate tongue that sent Trevor over the edge, but the understanding, the acknowledgment, the simple touch of Edgard\u2019s rough-skinned hand in his.</p><p>Trevor came in hot spurts, the sensations so intense he could only verbalize his enjoyment in a series of grunts. Edgard sucked in time to every pulse of his cock, prolonging the pleasure until Trevor\u2019s entire body quaked.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cJesus, Ed. Stop.\u201d His spent cock slipped free from Edgard\u2019s mouth, shiny, damp and red. Sated.</p><p>Edgard nuzzled the crease between Trevor\u2019s crotch and thigh, trying to catch his breath.</p><p>With the fingers of his free hand twisted in Ed\u2019s silky, dark hair, Trevor allowed the quiet moment to soothe him.</p><p>\u201cTrev.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down and Edgard clasped his forearm and rolled to his feet. Edgard\u2019s compact, powerful body was right in front of him, their hands still clasped together.</p><p>The gold disappeared from Edgard\u2019s eyes and they darkened to black. His lips, always temptingly full, were ripe and lush and trembling. Trevor softly said, \u201cHey,\u201d and angled forward. He nibbled and teased Edgard\u2019s mouth before diving in for a full-out, tongue-tangling kiss.</p><p>Trevor tasted himself on Edgard\u2019s tongue. It was a darker flavor than Chassie\u2019s mouth after she sucked him off.</p><p>Chassie. Guilt swamped him. First time he\u2019d thought of his wife since he\u2019d touched Edgard.</p><p>He broke the kiss in small increments. \u201cYour turn. Strip.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p> <p>As Edgard yanked off his T-shirt and pants, he wondered how far he could push Trevor in front of Chassie. In the past Trevor had been content to let Edgard lead, especially at the beginning of their sexual relationship. He\u2019d watched Trevor fuck enough women to know Trevor preferred to be dominant. After what he\u2019d seen in the barn between Trevor and Chassie, that preference still held true.</p><p>Part of Edgard\u2019s dominance had been an attempt to win Trevor over. To convince the stubborn man what they had inside and outside the bedroom was worth keeping. Now with Trevor married to Chassie, had his need for control changed?</p><p>Dismissing his brooding as pointless, Edgard glanced over at Trevor. Those pale blue eyes filled with appreciation and heat. Those strong, callused hands were clenched in fists by his naked flanks. When Trevor allowed his gaze to travel the full length of Edgard\u2019s body, Edgard forced himself to stay still, even as he willed Trevor to make the first move.</p><p>Trevor did. He ran a single blunt fingertip from the middle of Edgard\u2019s throat in a line straight down to the tip of his cock and back up. Slowly. Then he slid his palm down to Edgard\u2019s sternum and spread his fingers out like a starfish. \u201cI forgot how your chest hair felt against my skin,\u201d he murmured, almost to himself.</p><p>I didn\u2019t. Touch me. Put your goddamn hands all over me.</p><p>Edgard might\u2019ve voiced those demands in the past. Not now. Now he needed Trevor to show him the pace he could handle. So as Edgard\u2019s breathing grew more labored and his cock grew harder, he waited.</p><p>And Trevor sensed Edgard\u2019s restraint. He sidled forward. \u201cSo in your dirty fantasies, Ed, what\u2019m I doin\u2019 first? Fallin\u2019 to my knees?\u201d Trevor\u2019s hand skimmed Edgard\u2019s torso as he spoke. \u201cOr am I jackin\u2019 you off?\u201d Then that strong hand closed around Edgard\u2019s cock and tugged. \u201cOr do you just bend me over the couch from the get-go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre those my options?\u201d</p><p>Trevor chuckled against Edgard\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMaybe we oughta start out with option number two and work our way around the wish list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. That\u2019d be\u2014\u201d Edgard gasped when Trevor\u2019s work-roughened fingers stroked his balls, while firm lips traced the arc of his collarbone. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you handin\u2019 me the reins, partner?\u201d</p><p>Edgard angled his head as Trevor\u2019s lips traveled up the slope of his neck, letting the feel, the scent, the nearness of Trevor consume him.</p><p>\u201cYou afraid Chassie can\u2019t handle seein\u2019 me takin\u2019 what you love to dish out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt crossed my mind, sweet Jesus, I like having your mouth on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Trevor nipped Edgard\u2019s earlobe hard and growled, \u201cI ain\u2019t hidin\u2019 anything of what we do from my wife. Like you said, we\u2019ve come this far, ain\u2019t no sense in turnin\u2019 back now and pretendin\u2019 it ain\u2019t what it is. Tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, domineering Edgard reappeared. \u201cSuck my nipples while you\u2019re jacking me off.\u201d Edgard fisted his hand in Trevor\u2019s hair and pushed Trevor\u2019s face to where he wanted that eager mouth on his chest.</p><p>A thick growl escaped as Trevor licked the flat disk.</p><p>Edgard couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from the contrast of Trevor\u2019s pink tongue against the darker tones of his nipple. The sound of Trevor\u2019s contentment when he rubbed his cheek on the furred mat covering Edgard\u2019s chest burned into Edgard\u2019s ears like his favorite song.</p><p>Then Trevor stopped worrying the nipple with his teeth and switched to the other side.</p><p>\u201cI want your mouth,\u201d Edgard said.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Trevor lifted his head.</p><p>\u201cOn mine.\u201d He and Trevor were nearly the same height, which made the change easy as Trevor continued the handjob.</p><p>The kiss wasn\u2019t as frantic as earlier. But it was long and slow and deep. Edgard hungrily ran his hands over every section of Trevor\u2019s skin he could reach. Edgard had dreamed of this day so many times he didn\u2019t expect he could stop himself from coming fast. And it boggled his mind how quickly they\u2019d picked up that old rhythm\u2014as if they hadn\u2019t been apart. That idea spiraled Edgard\u2019s need higher.</p><p>But it was Trevor who dissolved the kiss. \u201cYou\u2019re close, Ed. Come on. Give it to me.</p><p>Let go. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d Without warning, Edgard removed Trevor\u2019s hand from his cock and shoved Trevor to his knees.</p><p>Trevor grabbed Edgard\u2019s hips. He swallowed Edgard\u2019s cock an inch at a time, letting the wetness work him clear to the root.</p><p>It was pure, sweet heaven seeing his prick buried in Trevor\u2019s mouth. The fringe of dark lashes fluttering as he closed his eyes. The high color on those high cheekbones. His nostrils flaring as he attempted to regulate his breathing.</p><p>No, Trevor hadn\u2019t forgotten how to make Edgard lose his mind. Edgard sampled other men who had the cock sucking technique down to an art, but Trevor\u2019s raw enthusiasm turned him inside out.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d Edgard said. \u201cI need more.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s head bobbed faster in shallow strokes. His tongue and lips worked Edgard\u2019s cock while Trevor\u2019s hand worked his balls. His saliva-slick middle finger rubbed the sensitive ridge of skin leading to Edgard\u2019s hole.</p><p>A tingle rocketed down Edgard\u2019s spine, gathering steam between his legs and shot straight out the end of his cock like supercharged jet fuel. He pumped his pelvis, wanting to feel the entire length of his cock enclosed by that wet heat.</p><p>But Trevor clamped his hands on Edgard\u2019s hipbones, keeping him in place. He wrapped his lips halfway up his shaft, sucking every spurt, then tonguing the tip of Edgard\u2019s twitching cock.</p><p>Blood rushed to Edgard\u2019s head; his vision dimmed as black and white spots danced beneath his lids. His limbs felt heavy, his body woozy. In the back of his mind, he wondered if Chassie would think him less-than-manly if he passed out in the face of such pleasure.</p><p>Pleasure provided to him by her husband.</p><p>Edgard opened his eyes and noticed his fingers were gripping Trevor\u2019s hair. The soft strands were a dozen diverse shades of blond, giving Trevor an angelic look. Coupled with Trevor\u2019s devilish grin...and Edgard had been a goner from the first smile.</p><p>A smile Edgard saw immediately after his cock slipped free from that smirking mouth. \u201cGood, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, meu amore.\u201d</p><p>The sound of Chassie shifting restlessly on the couch behind them brought Edgard out of his orgasmic stupor. He slid his fingertips down the outside of Trevor\u2019s face. His thumbs tenderly stroked Trevor\u2019s strong jawline.</p><p>Trevor pushed to his feet. Edgard expected him to back away, so it shocked the hell out of him when Trevor circled his arms around him and buried his damp face in Edgard\u2019s neck. His admission, \u201cJesus, I missed you,\u201d was nearly inaudible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But it was loud enough to lodge in Edgard\u2019s heart and his soul.</p><p>As much as he craved the affectionate side of this man, Edgard lifted Trevor\u2019s face and pecked him on the mouth. \u201cSame goes. But Chassie needs you. Go to her now.\u201d</p><p>Another quick kiss and Edgard retreated, snatching up his clothes and heading upstairs without looking back.</p> <p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s he goin\u2019?\u201d Chassie said just to break the awkward silence.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s givin\u2019 us some time.\u201d Trevor crouched in front of her. His eyes searched hers, the pale blue irises clouded with concern. \u201cTalk to me, baby.\u201d</p><p>When Chassie didn\u2019t respond, Trevor curled his hands around her hips, jerking her forward. His quick movement surprised her so much she flinched. Dammit. She hadn\u2019t meant to do that.</p><p>The muscle in Trevor\u2019s jaw rippled, a sign he\u2019d clenched his teeth together.</p> <p>She reached for him, the need to soothe automatic. She took time to glide her hand up his arm, wanting the contact of his skin on hers. \u201cTrevor, you startled me, that was all.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t recoiling from your touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Trevor\u2019s scrutiny was the most intense he\u2019d ever given her. \u201cI don\u2019t want no secrets between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. It was...\u201d Were there words to describe how she\u2019d felt at seeing her husband\u2019s unadulterated joy at being with another man?</p><p>\u201cWas what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot what I expected.\u201d</p> <p>Trevor\u2019s face inched closer. \u201cExplain that right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d hate it. Before, in the kitchen? When we were just talkin\u2019? I figured I\u2019d probably jump in and put a stop to it if it was more than I could handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t stop us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Part of me was relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause now I know it isn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>He squinted at her. \u201cWhat wasn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Chassie focused on the continual stroke of her thumb over the cut of muscle in Trevor\u2019s biceps. \u201cYou have a voracious sexual appetite, Trev. I understood that when we hooked up. And I...well, I told you I wasn\u2019t overly sexually experienced.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat never bothered me, just like it didn\u2019t bother you that I\u2019d been with more\u2019n my fair share of women. Even some women you\u2019re good friends with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s just sometimes, right after we\u2019d made love or had sex or whatever, you\u2019d get this far off look in your eye. You didn\u2019t realize you even did it. Bein\u2019 paranoid, I had it in my mind that I hadn\u2019t measured up and you were disappointed in me in bed and didn\u2019t want to say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChassie, baby, you know that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish.\u201d Chassie mustered the courage to look in Trevor\u2019s eyes. \u201cToday, after seein\u2019 this, I realize that was wrong. You weren\u2019t critiquing my performance. You weren\u2019t even thinkin\u2019 about me, were you?\u201d</p><p>He briefly squeezed his eyes shut and blinked them open. \u201cFuck. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. Like I said, I\u2019m more relieved than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelieved? That I was thinkin\u2019 about another...man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy female logic, right? It hurts, yeah, but it probably makes no sense when I admit I\u2019d be even more freaked out if it were a woman lodged so deeply in your thoughts.\u201d</p><p>A scowl distorted his face. \u201cBut now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut after seein\u2019 you and Edgard together, I understand you get something from bein\u2019 with him, something I can\u2019t give you, even if I become the perfect lover. You do the same for him. There\u2019s a need. There\u2019s a connection. I saw it and it felt a lot more like love than experimental man-lust from your past.\u201d When Trevor\u2019s eyes darted away, she demanded, \u201cI\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou askin\u2019 me if I love him?\u201d</p><p>Chassie shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 you I\u2019d understand if you did.\u201d</p><p>A heavy pause lingered before Trevor met her eyes.</p><p>Her stomach lurched at the raw emotion he didn\u2019t bother to hide. \u201cJesus, Chass.</p><p>What did I ever do to deserve you?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d suffered enough emotional turmoil with no clear solution, so she strove to lighten things up. \u201cMaybe the question oughta be what should you do to keep me? I need reassurance you find me as enthralling as the Brazilian. Because, darlin\u2019, he is one smokin\u2019 hot specimen of man flesh.\u201d</p><p>Trevor frowned.</p><p>Chassie wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that All-American boy next door look, tall, built and handsome, with your tousled blond hair, blazin\u2019 blue eyes and shit-eatin\u2019 grin.</p><p>Then there\u2019s this jaw that seems made of granite and the sexy dimple in your chin.\u201d She let her fingers trace the delineated lines of his triceps, biceps and forearms. \u201cYou\u2019re all hard muscled shoulders, chest and pecs, ripped abs. This set of pipes are highly lickable.\u201d</p><p>She bent her head, her tongue following the path her hand forged. \u201cAnd don\u2019t get me started on your lower half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I sensin\u2019 another \u2018but\u2019 here, wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But I\u2019d totally be lyin\u2019 if I didn\u2019t admit feelin\u2019 a bit lightheaded when faced with Edgard\u2019s dark good looks, slumberous eyes, killer smile and sexy accent. All those yummy extras wrapped up in a lean athletic body that knows its way around ropin\u2019, ridin\u2019 and ranchin\u2019? Mmm. He fills out a pair of Wranglers like nobody\u2019s business. But when Ed stripped to nothin\u2019? And I caught my first look at his big, long\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trevor smashed his mouth to hers. When their tongues twined, she was slightly shocked at Trevor\u2019s altered taste\u2014she detected a hint of Edgard\u2019s mouth as well as a hint of semen. This close, she could smell Edgard\u2019s scent on Trevor\u2019s skin. Just then Trevor seemed to remember Edgard had come in his mouth not ten minutes past and he stiffened.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t mind,\u201d Chassie said against his lips and took the kiss to the hungry, needy pace she craved.</p><p>Before too long Trevor\u2019s hands started to wander. Thumbing her nipples through her shirt, squeezing her breasts. Impatiently unsnapping the buttons on her blouse and releasing the front clasp on her bra.</p><p>She loved the way his callused fingers rasped against her hot skin and gooseflesh broke out across her chest and arms as a result of his touch.</p><p>His hand spanned her belly and eased over her waistband. He tapped her knees, a signal for her to spread herself open. When he stroked the seam of her jeans and found them damp, he abruptly ended the kiss. \u201cChrist. You\u2019re ready. From watchin\u2019 me and Ed together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trevor made a snarling noise, pushing Chassie until her shoulders bounced on the cushions. Then his face was inches from hers. \u201cIt drives me fuckin\u2019 crazy that you\u2019re turned on. Take off the pants. Now.\u201d</p><p>No surprise her demanding husband reappeared and hadn\u2019t been permanently cowed by Edgard\u2019s aggressiveness. She smiled slyly and shimmied out of her jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you still wearin\u2019 panties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you said to take my pants off. Which I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019ll do it my way.\u201d Trevor clamped his hands on her hips, scooting her down until her lower half hung off the couch as he rolled her plain white panties to her ankles. Once he had them off her body, he slingshotted them across the room.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpread \u2019em. I wanna see every inch of that sweet pink pussy.\u201d</p><p>Chassie stretched her legs wide and Trevor\u2019s hands flexed on her butt as he lifted her to his mouth.</p><p>He inhaled before he did anything else and a shudder rolled through him. \u201cGoddamn I love the way you smell. I like tastin\u2019 you even better.\u201d He deftly licked at the slick spots dotting the inside of her thighs.</p><p>Every time he repositioned his head, either his prickly beard brushed across her hot tissues, or the soft strands of his hair teased her clit. Then the middle of her thigh. The curve of her knee.</p><p>Chassie shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed by how fast she heated up, but at times she wondered if it were normal.</p><p>You went beyond normal when you demanded your husband and his male lover perform for you live like some gay burlesque show.</p><p>Yet, her voyeurism hadn\u2019t bothered either Edgard or Trevor. So maybe the only shame in their exhibition was in the feeling there should\u2019ve been shame when there was none.</p><p>Then Trevor\u2019s mouth was sucking on her sex, returning her focus to how much he loved giving her pleasure and she thought of nothing else.</p><p>Lapping at the syrup that coated her folds, he said, \u201cMmm. Mmm. Mmm.\u201d That humming noise sounded again right before Trevor jammed his tongue deep into her channel. He flicked faster inside her walls, tasting her from the inside out.</p><p>Her hands landed on his head and she tried to direct him to where she wanted his mouth.</p><p>Trevor lifted his face and looked at her. \u201cI\u2019m inclined to make you wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say. You already got yours, gave Edgard his and I had to sit there and do nothin\u2019 but watch.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cYou didn\u2019t touch yourself at all when Ed and I...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and it was hard not to because, God, it was really something to see. Trevor, I ache.\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped to the bit of flesh poking out from between her pussy lips. He murmured, \u201cCan\u2019t have that.\u201d Then Trevor fastened his mouth to her clit and began sucking. The impact caused her to arch into his mouth hard enough she felt the bite of his teeth on her pubic bone.</p><p>Between his concentrated attention and the live porn as foreplay, her blood pooled in that nerve-rich tissue and coiled like a hot snake hissing to be unleashed. The licking, throbbing sensations coalesced and the climax ripped through her so quickly she couldn\u2019t moan, she couldn\u2019t speak and she was fairly sure she stopped breathing. Chassie clutched handfuls of Trevor\u2019s hair as she rode out the orgasm on his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trevor continued to nuzzle and kiss her mound, as she came down from such sharp, sweet pleasure. After she peeled her eyes open, she smoothed his wild hairdo back into place and sighed. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>His smile lit up her world, reminding her he was her world. And she\u2019d do anything in the world to keep him. \u201cYeah. That was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough.\u201d Trevor grabbed her, flipped her on her back on the floor and levered his body over hers. \u201cNever enough when it comes to you.\u201d His hand shook as he pushed a section of hair behind her ear. \u201cChassie, I love you. You know that, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She turned her head and kissed his palm. \u201cForget everything else and show me.\u201d</p><p>The unhurried pace, a dreamy reconnection of bodies and hearts and souls was exactly what they both needed. Yet even after they climbed into their marriage bed, curled around each other, offering lovers\u2019 words of reassurance and devotion in the darkness of the night, Chassie knew everything had changed, and she wasn\u2019t sure if either of them were fully ready to deal with the emotional backlash.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>There was no time the next morning for awkward moments or uncomfortable lags in the conversation. Edgard knocked on their door at five a.m. after he\u2019d found a problem when checking on Meridian.</p><p>Trevor dressed and raced out with Edgard while Chassie started a pot of coffee. It was damn cold out\u2014the thermometer read a frigid twelve degrees\u2014and they\u2019d need to warm up after they dealt with whatever ailed the horse. She pulled her hoodie more tightly around her head as she buttoned her coat.</p> <p>As she crossed the yard, her breath puffed out in a white cloud, freezing her nose.</p><p>She slid the barn door open and snuck inside.</p><p>No grunting animal sounds or encouraging human voices. By the time she saw the grayish light of the stall door open to the outside corral, she knew it was too late.</p><p>Wordlessly, Edgard and Trevor backed away so Chassie could climb up and peer over the slats.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to look. But she did.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m sorry. I know how much she meant to you.\u201d</p> <p>Tears welled as she stared at the beautiful dead mare outside in the small pen. Her foal was dead, half in/half out of the birth canal. \u201cHow\u2019d Meridian get outside?\u201d</p><p>Edgard said, \u201cShe was restless when I first got here. I opened the door, thinking she might calm down if she could move better. She wouldn\u2019t let me near her, it was dark and I didn\u2019t realize where the foal was until it was too late.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d seen her share of livestock deaths and animal stillbirths, but this one hit her hard. \u201cOh, damn, girl. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Strong hands squeezed her shoulders.</p><p>Chassie found her voice. \u201cIf I would\u2019ve checked on her in the middle of the night like I was supposed to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t matter. Nothin\u2019 even the vet could\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat don\u2019t make me feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change the facts, Chass, regardless of how it makes you feel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo kiddin\u2019.\u201d She hated this cold, tough side of Trevor that reminded her of her father. She hopped down and faced her husband. \u201cWhat happens now? We can\u2019t afford\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know we just lost three grand overnight, not includin\u2019 what that foal woulda brung? You think I don\u2019t know we can\u2019t afford to replace her?\u201d Trevor spun around as if to punch the wooden slat. \u201cJesus, Chassie, I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>She slapped her hand over her mouth to keep from berating him for his jerkish behavior.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not helping,\u201d Edgard snapped.</p><p>\u201cKnow what will help, Ed? Find me a goddamn place to put Meridian\u2019s carcass that ain\u2019t by the herd and where the ground ain\u2019t frozen solid. Least that stubborn mare had the good sense to die outside so I can get to her with the farmhand and I don\u2019t have to use the machine to tear apart the damn barn.\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s tears fell on the cold hay-strewn floor as Trevor fumed and paced and muttered.</p><p>\u201cKnow what else\u2019d help, Trev?\u201d Edgard\u2019s tone was measured. \u201cIf you\u2019d shut the hell up and walk it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Harsh, cold silence lingered.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s gentle hands boosted Chassie\u2019s chin and wiped the wetness from her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Meridian.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. Some hard-as-spurs ranch wife she\u2019d become. While her husband and his best friend sniped at each other, trying to find a solution to the problem of disposing of the dead horse, all she could do was stand like a statue and weep in silence.</p><p>Her father\u2019s voice boomed in her head, \u201cYou\u2019re too emotional, Chassie. Too easily swayed by people and animals. That\u2019s why it takes a man to run a ranch. A man don\u2019t let emotions get in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m such a crybaby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak around the lump in her throat. Beneath his reserved manner Edgard was calming and compassionate. She was half-tempted to throw herself into his arms for comfort since her husband was being such a jackass.</p><p>\u201cChass, sweetheart, why don\u2019t you let me deal with this?\u201d</p><p>By the look in Edgard\u2019s eyes she knew \u201cthis\u201d meant the disposal of the animal and Trevor\u2019s mood. She swallowed hard. \u201cWhy? Because I\u2019m a weepy woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because the same thing happened to me on my ranch last year.\u201d As he paused, appearing to weigh the rest of his answer, his thumb kept feathering over her jawline.</p><p>Softly. Sweetly. A light touch that aroused rather than reassured. \u201cI wished to heaven I\u2019d had someone to take care of it, or help me, or hell even to cry with, but I ended up doing everything all by myself and it sucked big time.\u201d</p><p>His constant caress sent goose bumps cascading down her neck. She shivered, wondering how she could possibly feel anything but sorrow. Wondering how she could possibly be contemplating the press of Edgard\u2019s full, soft-looking lips against hers in the ultimate show of comfort.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s eyes narrowed. Again, she feared he knew the direction her thoughts had taken. Her face heated. But he didn\u2019t stop touching her. And she didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>Trevor barked, \u201cChassie. You goin\u2019 back to the house? Or doin\u2019 the mornin\u2019 feedin\u2019?</p><p>\u2019Cause it\u2019s too goddamn cold out here to be standin\u2019 around cryin\u2019 about a dead horse while lettin\u2019 the cattle starve.\u201d He stomped to the tack room and slammed the door.</p><p>\u201cI see he\u2019s still a total asshole when he\u2019s upset, huh?\u201d Edgard muttered.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always been that way when something happens that he can\u2019t control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured. He was probably an asshole to you a lot, huh?\u201d</p><p>Edgard shrugged. \u201cI got used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that makes one of us \u2019cause I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t put up with it.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cLuckily it doesn\u2019t happen often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019d hate to have to kick his sorry ass for being mean to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a heartbeat, darlin\u2019,\u201d he drawled, mimicking Trevor.</p><p>Chassie smiled. Edgard smiled back.</p><p>\u201cGet your chores done, Chass, and I might have a surprise for you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because.\u201d Then he leaned forward and placed his warm, damp lips on her cold forehead, letting the less-than-platonic kiss linger before he entered the stall.</p><p>Three hours later Trevor and Edgard disposed of the horse, a nasty, depressing job every rancher hated doing but was a natural part of life on a ranch. Stock deaths never got easier\u2014Edgard knew that held true not only for him, but for all folks who made their living from the land and were entrusted with the care of animals.</p><p>They rode in the truck after fixing the heat pump that\u2019d frozen overnight in the stock tank in the north pasture and Trevor was brooding.</p><p>Edgard preferred moody Trevor to standoffish Trevor. He\u2019d been involved with Trevor long enough to know the events of last night were not a topic for discussion. He knew better than to offer Trevor a show of physical comfort.</p><p>That\u2019d been another issue between them, Edgard\u2019s need for casual affection and Trevor\u2019s refusal to give it to him outside the bedroom. Edgard hadn\u2019t been looking for deep kisses, or walking arm in arm as they\u2019d sauntered down the sidewalk, just an occasional touch when they were alone.</p><p>It\u2019d taken him a year to realize the only time they\u2019d truly been alone were those nights on the road after they\u2019d checked into a motel. Colby, while not necessarily homophobic, only agreed to stay on\u2014after he\u2019d literally caught them with their pants down\u2014if they kept their relationship strictly professional in front of him. At all times.</p><p>Edgard also knew Trevor\u2019s reluctance to even simply hold Edgard\u2019s hand was practical: if they became accustomed to touching in semi-private spaces such as the truck, or the horse trailer when they were getting ready to compete, it\u2019d be easy to slip up and touch in public.</p><p>So rather than strike a balance, Trevor instituted a strict \u201chands off\u201d policy. A policy Edgard hated and mocked at every opportunity, but it was a policy Trevor didn\u2019t bend on.</p><p>Trevor\u2019s private affection had been worth it.</p><p>For a while anyway.</p><p>Dwight Yoakam droning in the background didn\u2019t mask the edgy stillness hanging in the air. Edgard took a sip of his coffee as Trevor hit a bump and warm liquid sloshed everywhere. He muttered and stripped off his leather glove with his teeth, mopping up the spot on his jeans.</p><p>\u201cShit. Sorry. Didn\u2019t mean to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He drained the rest and shoved the cup in the cup holder. \u201cBeen drinking coffee since the crack of nothin\u2019 anyway. Probably had enough.\u201d</p><p>Trevor shot him a look. \u201cWhy\u2019d you get up so early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d Edgard didn\u2019t elaborate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It surprised him when Trevor admitted, \u201cI wasn\u2019t sleepin\u2019 either. I heard you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Now I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 if I would\u2019ve gotten up when you did maybe we coulda saved that damn horse.\u201d</p> <p>Edgard frowned. \u201cBut you told Chassie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Chassie what she needed to hear so she didn\u2019t feel guilty,\u201d Trevor said irritably. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s gonna be takin\u2019 on the brunt of the guilt around here, it\u2019s gonna be me, not her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is noble, Trev, but you didn\u2019t have to be so cruel to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tellin\u2019 me how to handle my wife, Ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m telling you after what she\u2019s been through in the last couple of days you should\u2019ve expected she\u2019d be an emotional train wreck. You should\u2019ve been more sympathetic to her losing the horse, not less.\u201d Edgard mentally braced himself for Trevor\u2019s temper to explode.</p> <p>But it didn\u2019t, he just nodded. \u201cI know. Even as that mean shit was runnin\u2019 out of my mouth like I\u2019d developed a case of scour, I couldn\u2019t stop it.\u201d Trevor hit the brakes and threw the truck in park. His hands gripped the steering wheel below where he\u2019d placed his forehead. \u201cAh fuck. I can\u2019t believe what a prick I am sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s shoulders rose and fell quickly. Was Trevor crying? Or hyperventilating?</p><p>Either way, Trevor wouldn\u2019t accept his comfort, so Edgard stayed immobile, aching for the chance to pacify the man in mind or body. To ease him in some way, because seeing Trevor hurting was still like a knife in his gut.</p><p>Finally, Trevor sighed. \u201cI never wanna be like him. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe like who?\u201d Edgard asked, even when he knew.</p><p>\u201cLike my father.\u201d</p> <p>Edgard didn\u2019t offer him any false words of comfort.</p><p>\u201cIt scares the hell out of me. Chassie don\u2019t know what a bastard my dad was. Still is.</p><p>I didn\u2019t tell her about some of the shit he\u2019d pulled because I...goddammit, I worried she wouldn\u2019t marry me because she\u2019d be afraid I\u2019d turn out like him.</p><p>\u201cNow I can\u2019t tell her because I\u2019m afraid with all the other stuff that\u2019s happened, she\u2019ll kick me to the fence. Seems I can\u2019t tell her nothin\u2019 without fear of losin\u2019 her.\u201d His short bark of laughter rivaled the cold for bitterness. \u201cI suck at this spillin\u2019 my guts stuff.</p><p>I always have. You know that probably better\u2019n anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s a lousy excuse. It always has been.\u201d</p><p>Trevor slowly lifted his head and gave Edgard an incredulous look. \u201cHow is that smartass answer supposed to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so now you want my help?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell yeah, since it\u2019s obvious I fucked up and it\u2019s obvious you think you know how to fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Edgard pointed to the cell phone clipped on the dash. \u201cCall her. Say, \u2018Baby, I\u2019m sorry I was an asshole. I love you\u2019, but for Christsake don\u2019t qualify it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQualify it, meanin\u2019 what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tack on, \u2018I was an asshole because I\u2019m under stress\u2019, just apologize. Period.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes the smallest gestures have the biggest impact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be that easy,\u201d Trevor muttered, snatching the phone. He faced out the driver\u2019s side window but didn\u2019t lower his voice.</p><p>\u201cHey, Chass. No. Nothin\u2019s wrong. I just wanted to say...I\u2019m sorry. You know, for earlier today. In the barn. I was a jerk.\u201d When Trevor started to tack on, \u201cBecause...\u201d</p><p>Edgard reached over and smacked him on the arm. Trevor whirled back around. \u201cJesus, Mancuso. What the fuck?\u201d</p><p>Edgard shook his head and mouthed, \u201cNo excuses.\u201d</p><p>Still glaring at Edgard, Trevor said, \u201cNo, nothin\u2019 happened. Ed spilled his coffee all over himself. Yeah. He\u2019s fine, even when he\u2019s graceful as a bear.\u201d Trevor mouthed,</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d at Edgard. Pause. \u201cSure. Sounds good. We\u2019ll be home for lunch in a bit. Love you too, baby.\u201d</p><p>After he snapped the phone shut, he stabbed the antennae at Edgard and warned,</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t allowed to gloat, amigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise not to start humming the Mexican hat dance and clacking my castanets in victory,\u201d he said wryly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hilarious.\u201d Trevor put the truck in drive and they were bumping across the uneven terrain.</p><p>Edgard squinted at the unfamiliar stark scenery outside his window. Dirt-covered snow stretched across miles of flat prairie; dead clumps of brownish grass poked through the thin layer of white. Wind stripped the moisture away from the ground in places, leaving patches of red dirt. Skeletal trees, rocks, tumbleweeds scattered along the fenceline added to the vastness and the loneliness of the scene.</p><p>Isolation. Desperation. It fit Edgard\u2019s mood, not only today, but for the last year.</p><p>Gruffly, Trevor said, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the truck cab. So many things had been left unsaid. Again. Maybe they were doomed to be stuck at that impasse. Unable to go back; unwilling to move forward.</p><p>The events of last night seemed so far away, in that surreal state where Edgard questioned whether it\u2019d really happened.</p><p>A few minutes later, out of the blue, Trevor spoke again. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed, Ed. You always were quiet, that strong silent type of guy, especially in public, but you\u2019re even more so these days. What gives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo glad you noticed,\u201d Edgard muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed lots of things.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s head whipped around at the silky resonance in Trevor\u2019s tone. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But mostly I notice how you get a little prissy when I bring up something you don\u2019t wanna discuss.\u201d</p><p>His mouth dropped open. \u201cPrissy? For Christsake, I\u2019ve never been prissy a day in my life.\u201d</p><p>Trevor grinned. \u201cSee? That right there was prissy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sayin\u2019...\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s you-know-you-love-me grin had always been Edgard\u2019s downfall. He smiled back. \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you gonna tell me why you don\u2019t wanna talk about what happened to you in the last few years?\u201d</p><p>Edgard didn\u2019t respond. Didn\u2019t know where or how to start, actually. He focused his attention out the window, absentmindedly pinching the tips of his wet leather glove between his fingers and thumb. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>A warm, dry hand covered his, stopping his restless fingers, and damn near stopping his heart. Edgard didn\u2019t move. He was frozen in that place between hope and fear.</p><p>\u201cIt matters to me,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>Edgard waited for Trevor to realize they were still touching and jerk his hand back.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t, he kept holding on. And yeah, maybe it did make Edgard prissy, but the urge to weep overwhelmed him. He cleared his throat. \u201cWhat happened is my mother died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit, buddy, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Trevor squeezed Edgard\u2019s hand. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a year and a half ago. Car accident. A shitload of bad stuff happened afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It sucked. Big time. I still can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence. Of acceptance. \u201cLemme know if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Edgard nodded and Trevor didn\u2019t pester him further.</p><p>But Trevor continued holding Edgard\u2019s hand in silence until they returned to the house, proving the smallest gestures did have the biggest impact.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Trevor spent the hours after lunch in the office catching up on paperwork. Maybe he\u2019d find a way to come up with the money to pay Gus.</p><p>Right. Might as well wish for a pot of gold.</p><p>Country music played in the background while Chassie did laundry and scurried around the house cleaning. A peppery aroma wafted in and he sniffed with appreciation.</p><p>Swiss steak. One of his favorites.</p><p>Edgard had borrowed his truck, but hadn\u2019t been forthcoming about his destination.</p><p>Truthfully, Trevor needed the break from both his wife and his former roping partner.</p><p>His life was one fucked up, confusing mess. Being with Edgard last night hadn\u2019t cleared up his inner turmoil, just added more fuel to the fire. Trevor loved his wife with an all-consuming passion. But if it was all consuming, what the hell was he doing thinking about...doing Edgard again?</p><p>He shoved his office chair to the wall and propped his feet up on the small desk. It was more than sex. He and Edgard had been good friends before becoming lovers, sharing everything, from their love of playing practical jokes, to ways to stave off boredom on the range. Although their life stories were vastly different, they\u2019d clicked.</p><p>After spending eight years on the circuit surrounded my men, Trevor admitted to himself that he needed male companionship. Chassie was great, but he missed that macho bullshit and competitiveness he\u2019d gotten from his rodeo buddies.</p><p>After he\u2019d moved on, from both his family and the circuit, he\u2019d been so busy scrambling to make a living he hadn\u2019t thought much about friendship. Colby had been his best friend for years, both on and off the circuit. Naturally things\u2019d changed after Colby\u2019s injury and Colby settled down with Channing.</p><p>But before that, their friendship changed when Colby discovered Trevor and Edgard were together, because Trevor confided in Colby less and Edgard more. They\u2019d still participated in threesomes, foursomes with whatever chicks tripped their triggers, but when the romp ended, more often than not, Trevor crawled in bed with Edgard. Which left Colby alone most nights.</p><p>The last year on the circuit tempers were short, even after Colby started winning consistently. Being a selfish bastard, Trevor hadn\u2019t noticed Colby\u2019s loneliness until Channing joined them on the road. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After Colby\u2019s injury, Edgard left and Trevor hadn\u2019t gotten close to anyone again until Chassie. Much as he loved everything about her, moving onto her homeplace meant he hadn\u2019t met many of the locals besides Gus and Chassie\u2019s assorted West and McKay relatives. Chassie wasn\u2019t overly social, but she\u2019d grown up outside of Sundance and, whenever they went to town, it was obvious she knew everyone.</p><p>He\u2019d liked having Edgard to tool around with in the truck. Fixing equipment, doing shit work that Chassie shouldn\u2019t have to deal with\u2014though she\u2019d pop him upside the head for hinting she had less guts than any man. Lord. He\u2019d really missed that \u201cbuddy\u201d</p><p>part of his relationship with Edgard and it\u2019d be worse once Edgard left.</p> <p>So where did that leave them? Despite the comment his truck was ready, Edgard hadn\u2019t indicated he\u2019d be moving on soon. Chassie hadn\u2019t been chomping at the bit to kick him out either\u2014even after last night. It boggled Trevor\u2019s mind that not only had Edgard sought out Chassie to soothe her after the business with Meridian, he\u2019d exerted a calming influence on her that day she\u2019d caught them together, an easy solace that Trevor hadn\u2019t managed after being married to the woman for a year.</p><p>In reality, Chassie had spent more time with Edgard in the last two weeks than he had. Edgard had accompanied Chassie on the morning cattle checks. She\u2019d taken him to town for supplies. They cooked supper together. Hell, that flirtatious Brazilian had been teaching Chassie Portuguese and how to tango.</p><p>If Edgard stuck around would Trevor be jealous if Chassie and Edgard became close in a way that had nothing to do with him? Even when Trevor didn\u2019t have a right to be?</p><p>Would Chassie be jealous? Or would she roll with it like she\u2019d rolled with everything else?</p><p>She knocked on the door and poked her head in. \u201cHey, hon. Edgard\u2019s back. There\u2019s something he wants to show me in the barn.\u201d</p> <p>Trevor grinned. \u201cChass, baby, a country girl like you oughten be fallin\u2019 for that tired old line. For shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a tired line if it don\u2019t work. Obviously it\u2019s worked on me, since I\u2019ll be in the barn with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come? Or is this a private showin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cAfter what I was shown last night, I think that</p><p>\u2018privacy\u2019 ship has sailed for all three of us, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>No coy bullshit. \u201cI\u2019m damn glad you\u2019re always so straightforward. It\u2019s one of my very favorite things about you.\u201d</p> <p>Chassie blushed. \u201cThank you. But your sweet-talkin\u2019 ain\u2019t keepin\u2019 me away from my present.\u201d</p><p>Trevor lifted both brows. \u201cEdgard bought you a gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis I gotta see.\u201d He slipped on his coat as Chassie nearly skipped ahead of him to the barn.</p><p>Inside the dark space, she yelled, \u201cEd? Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack here, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Sweetheart?</p><p>Chassie raced to the corner stall and stopped at the open door. \u201cOmigod. Are you serious? Is that really for me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. She\u2019s all yours. Nothin\u2019 to be scared of. She\u2019s friendly. Really friendly. See?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdgard, you sweetie-pie, I could just kiss you!\u201d</p><p>Talk about being friendly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a mighty big temptation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at her. She\u2019s darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Trevor muttered. He\u2019d kill Edgard if he\u2019d bought Chassie a horse. Kill him.</p><p>The stall had been cleaned since this morning and a fresh layer of straw spread out.</p><p>Chassie was on her knees. Edgard was right beside her. Close beside her. Practically on top of her.</p><p>The next sound he heard wasn\u2019t a whinny, but a baaa-baaa. Chassie laughed and leaned against Edgard, allowing Trevor to see the animal.</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell did you buy her...Jesus, is that a goat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. Nope. The furry creature was still right there. \u201cWhy did you buy my wife a goat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she wanted one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Since when have you wanted a goat, Chass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince always,\u201d Chassie retorted. She returned her focus to Edgard. \u201cDo you think she\u2019ll be lonely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d Edgard said with a big smile.</p><p>\u201cAlways?\u201d Trevor repeated. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t know everything about me, Trevor. A girl\u2019s gotta have some secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? If it\u2019s such a great big secret then how did Edgard hear about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChassie told me one of the first days we were out doing chores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you remembered. We\u2019ve talked about a lot of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some stuff, not so much, eh, querida?\u201d</p><p>Trevor ground his teeth together. \u201cWhat kind of stuff?\u201d</p><p>But Chassie ignored him as she was too busy rubbing her fingers on the top of the goat\u2019s head. \u201cOoh, feel right here. She\u2019s so soft.\u201d She placed Edgard\u2019s hand under hers and they stroked the grayish-white coat together.</p><p>A goat. Chassie wanted a goat? What else didn\u2019t he know about his wife?</p><p>Probably nothing as earth shattering as your love affair with a man.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fuckin\u2019 believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Is Edgard buyin\u2019 me a goat what gets your goat, Trev?\u201d Chassie teased.</p><p>Edgard busted out in deep belly laughter and he high-fived Chassie.</p><p>\u201cVery funny, Chass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d She cooed, \u201cIsn\u2019t she sweet?\u201d at the animal.</p><p>Edgard kept grinning at Chassie with a very pleased look on his face. \u201cNot as sweet as you.\u201d</p><p>Chassie bumped him with her hip. \u201cDo I need to get a bucket to catch the honey drippin\u2019 from your mouth today?\u201d</p><p>A low-pitched chuckle. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Trevor stood there dumbfounded, feeling as if he\u2019d materialized in another dimension.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about my new pet. What\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreta. Marlin said this little gal has a great disposition and she didn\u2019t have any problems giving birth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant?\u201d Chassie squealed.</p><p>\u201cAt least her name ain\u2019t Billy.\u201d Trevor trip-trapped into the stall. He dropped to his knees to get a closer look at the creature, which was trying to eat a balled up piece of leather. Familiar leather. His eyes narrowed. \u201cHey. Is that my glove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOopsie.\u201d Chassie gently tugged it out of Greta\u2019s mouth, chastising, \u201cBad girl, Greta.\u201d</p><p>The nanny goat lowered her head in apparent shame and let out a mournful baaa-baaa.</p><p>Edgard and Chassie both laughed.</p><p>\u201cDid you feed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably needs a drink first. I\u2019ll get a bucket of water.\u201d Chassie was off like a bullet.</p><p>Greta butted Edgard in the chest until he scratched behind her ear. She butted him again and he shifted sideways until he and Trevor were hip-to-hip.</p><p>Just as Trevor was about to open his mouth, Edgard said, \u201cBefore you chew me out, Chassie needed something to cheer her up today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. How\u2019d you find a goat seller when you\u2019ve only been here two weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Gus. He told me about Marlin Jones who lives out by Devil\u2019s Tower. I\u2019d planned to wait and take Chassie with me so she could pick one herself, but like I said, after losing Meridian this morning, she needed a pick-me-up.\u201d</p><p>As they petted Greta, Trevor grumbled, \u201cAt least you didn\u2019t buy her a damn horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now that you brought it up, there\u2019s something else I need to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s head swiveled toward that silky voice. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d Edgard\u2019s brilliant smile and mischievous eyes caused Trevor\u2019s stomach to flip. Talk about pure sexual power. \u201cYou are so easy, Trev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha. Asshole. Buyin\u2019 my wife gifts. I oughta kick your butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just pissed you didn\u2019t think of it first. Besides, if I wasn\u2019t allowed to gloat earlier, then you ain\u2019t allowed to pout now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t poutin\u2019. Why would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that lower lip of yours is sticking out. Then again it always has.\u201d Edgard\u2019s slumberous gaze dropped to Trevor\u2019s mouth.</p><p>That seesaw sensation jumped in his gut again.</p><p>\u201cDamn, your mouth is tempting, way too tempting.\u201d Edgard lowered his head.</p><p>Trevor remained motionless, one hand buried in the goat\u2019s pelt. The sweet, soft tease of Edgard\u2019s firm lips, the sharp scrape of teeth and a bristly beard, the erratic bursts of warm breath morphed into a gentle kiss. Trevor didn\u2019t pull back; he just closed his eyes and let it happen.</p><p>Their bodies didn\u2019t touch, but the palpable heat between them expanded. The subtle movements and wet glide of mouth on mouth was calming and tender and unexpectedly erotic. But necessary. Lord. As his heart rate picked up and Edgard\u2019s taste danced on his tongue, Trevor realized just how necessary this kiss was.</p><p>An hour\u2014a day\u2014a week later, Chassie cleared her throat behind them.</p><p>Neither man jerked away guiltily. But knowing his lips were shiny and wet from Edgard\u2019s, it was hard for Trevor to meet his wife\u2019s curious gaze.</p><p>But oddly enough, her eyes were on the slyly grinning Brazilian. She set the water bucket down. \u201cSo, Edgard, was that kiss Trevor\u2019s way of thankin\u2019 you for buyin\u2019 me a goat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Although...it\u2019s got me wondering how he might\u2019ve thanked me if I\u2019d\u2019ve bought you a horse.\u201d</p><p>Chassie laughed. Not a forced polite chuckle, her real, honest laughter. \u201cYou know, I was wondering the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? You could tell me your idea. Whisper it in my ear, soft and low, like this,\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Edgard\u2019s voice dropped to a sexy bass rumble. \u201cThen we could compare ideas to see whose is the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so bad, Edgard, usin\u2019 that sexy Portuguese drawl against me,\u201d she taunted.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder Trevor can\u2019t resist you. You tryin\u2019 to put us both under your spell?\u201d</p> <p>Good Lord. They were flirting. Right in front of him. Trevor couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>Especially not after his cock had taken notice of their sexy, playful banter.</p><p>\u201cIs it workin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Depends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn whether I\u2019ll be watchin\u2019 again or participating in your magic act tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely participating. Would that sweeten the offer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if we find out just how sweet it can be after supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d Edgard jumped to his feet. \u201cLet\u2019s eat. Right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starved,\u201d Trevor added.</p><p>Chassie laughed. \u201cYou guys are insatiable.\u201d</p> <p>As the implications of this next step and the possibilities stretched before them, Trevor figured this\u2019d be the shortest meal ever.</p><p>But he hoped it\u2019d be the longest night of his life.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>They\u2019d made an effort to keep the conversation low-key while they ate, discussing normal, everyday ranch issues. Upcoming calving, Greta. The sad situation with Meridian. The weather report.</p><p>An electric hum crackled in the air and Chassie was going to jump out of her skin.</p><p>She cleared the plates and stored the leftovers in Tupperware. Wiped down the counters and ran water in the sink with a hefty squirt of soap.</p><p>A warm body moved in behind her. Hot breath tickled her ear. \u201cLeave \u2019em, Chass.</p><p>Come upstairs. I want you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts, baby. This was your idea.\u201d Trevor spun her into his arms. He kissed the top of her head, then tilted her chin up to look into her eyes. \u201cYou were flirtin\u2019 with Edgard. I don\u2019t know whether I oughta punish you or reward you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurned on beyond belief. And...\u201d Trevor aimed his gaze out the window.</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d Chassie flicked the deep dimple in his chin, trying to get him to look at her.</p><p>\u201cTruthfully, I\u2019m a little nervous.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d expected him to say jealous. \u201cWhy nervous? Isn\u2019t a threesome old news for you and Edgard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the same old threesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re involved and it makes me psycho to imagine any man besides me touchin\u2019 you. Ed and I haven\u2019t ever been together...as lovers, in a threesome. Before it was me with the woman and him watchin\u2019 or both of us with her, but not he and I together...ah hell, it\u2019s just different, okay?\u201d</p><p>Oddly enough, Trevor\u2019s nerves calmed Chassie\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m glad. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m gettin\u2019 a part of each of you that no other woman has had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo other woman has ever had my heart.\u201d</p><p>As true as she believed that statement to be, Chassie knew Edgard owned a piece of Trevor\u2019s heart long before Trevor had given the rest to her. For the first time since she\u2019d found out about them, since she\u2019d seen them together as lovers, she didn\u2019t feel threatened. \u201cWhere is Edgard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpstairs in our room. Let\u2019s not keep him waitin\u2019.\u201d Trevor clasped her hand and kept hold of it until they reached their bedroom.</p><p>In their large bedroom, Chassie shifted from foot to foot, antsy, scared and unsure if she should strip or what. \u201cMaybe we\u2014\u201d Then Trevor started kissing her in that sweet, sure way of his. Kisses so slow and hot and deep she melted inside. Her body became as pliant as silly putty.</p><p>He unbuttoned her blouse, taking his time sliding it off. Next he unfastened her jeans, his mouth scattered kisses across her belly and he tugged the denim free from her legs. She was down to her bra and panties, enjoying more of those drugging kisses when unfamiliar hands landed on her hips.</p><p>She gasped, whipping around to look at Edgard.</p><p>A stark naked Edgard. A fully aroused, stark naked Edgard.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. You\u2019re umm...you\u2019re all...\u201d Why? Trevor still was fully clothed.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were all right with this?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cI-I.\u201d Stop babbling. \u201cI guess. I just...\u201d</p><p>Edgard caressed her cheek, like he had earlier in the barn. And like earlier, her pulse took off like a runaway horse. \u201cYou just what, Chass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you liked\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen?\u201d</p><p>Chassie nodded.</p><p>\u201cI like you. You\u2019re a woman.\u201d</p><p>She blurted, \u201cWhy? Because I\u2019m flat-chested and I look like a guy?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, not gently but with utter male heat. \u201cOh, there ain\u2019t a guy-like thing about you, sweetheart, and trust me, that ain\u2019t a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d In for a penny; in for a pound. \u201cSo you aren\u2019t here for Trevor\u2019s sake? Takin\u2019 one for the team?\u201d</p><p>Trevor snickered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Wyoming because of Trevor. I\u2019m in this bedroom because of you and Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Her gaze dropped to his hard cock.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She managed to drag her eyes away from the rosy, uncircumcised length of maleness. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it stands to reason that if you\u2019re attracted to Trevor, and I\u2019m attracted to Trevor, and he\u2019s attracted to both of us, that you and I might be attracted to each other a little?\u201d</p><p>Of all the crazy thoughts ricocheting in her head, that one, the most logical one, hadn\u2019t occurred to her.</p><p>But hadn\u2019t she and Edgard been flirting and testing the boundaries since the moment the sexy Brazilian sauntered down the driveway? Slow dancing? Doing chores? Cooking together? Hadn\u2019t it turned her on knowing Edgard had whacked off as he watched and listened to her and Trevor fucking in the barn?</p><p>She\u2019d assumed they\u2019d both gone out of their way to forge a relationship because of a need to please Trevor. But maybe they\u2019d tried for a relationship out of a need to please themselves. And wouldn\u2019t it make sense that the relationship that was an offshoot of their individual relationships with Trevor would be sexual in nature too?</p><p>It made perfect sense and no sense at all.</p><p>Chassie scrutinized Edgard\u2019s gorgeous face and didn\u2019t see confusion. Just desire. He wasn\u2019t eyeballing Trevor; he was looking straight at her. So that molten desire was for her.</p><p>Impatiently, Trevor said, \u201cWe gonna stand here all night and talk? Or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Chassie angled her head and gently bit the fleshy outer part of Edgard\u2019s thumb.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s eyes flashed fire.</p><p>Chassie smiled gleefully and spun toward her\u2014whoa\u2014now totally naked husband.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here, guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuckily we do. Relax and let it happen,\u201d Trevor said. \u201cKeep kissin\u2019 me as we\u2019re both touchin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>At first it felt unnerving with Trevor\u2019s hands caressing her face and another set skimming her bare shoulders. Edgard unhooked her bra and took it off, allowing her breasts to brush Trevor\u2019s hot, muscled chest.</p><p>The situation changed from unsettling to promising when Edgard\u2019s tongue traced her spine down to the waistband of her panties. His warm hands slipped beneath the fabric and her underwear slithered to the floor. Then those same slow-moving hands smoothed up her calves, the backs of her knees, her thighs to the curve of her ass.</p><p>Between Edgard\u2019s constant feathery strokes and Trevor\u2019s endless hungry kisses Chassie was dizzy with want.</p><p>Trevor growled, \u201cBed. Now.\u201d</p><p>The quilt had been stripped back to the sheets. She hopped into the middle of the mattress and awaited further instructions from her large-and-in-charge husband.</p><p>But Edgard eased in behind Trevor, resting his chin on Trevor\u2019s shoulder as they both stared at her. Curiously. Eagerly.</p><p>Chassie watched the men, fascinated by the physical and emotional contrasts.</p><p>Trevor\u2019s fair hair and chiseled Nordic features against Edgard\u2019s caramelly skin and exotic, dark good looks. Their body language spoke volumes, one stoic and one persistent. Edgard bulled his way into Trevor\u2019s space entirely, silently demanding\u2014and receiving\u2014Trevor\u2019s attention.</p><p>Almost on cue, Trevor relaxed, nuzzling the side of his face into Edgard\u2019s\u2014a surprisingly shy move. Part of her ached for him and how much he must\u2019ve missed Edgard\u2019s affection, even when he\u2019d only had it in private.</p><p>\u201cYour call, Trev. What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s chest rose and fell rapidly. \u201cI want to make her come with my mouth. Then I want to fuck her. And while I\u2019m fucking her, I want you to fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s sex clenched with want.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so long, Ed. It\u2019s been...since you...since that last time in Cheyenne.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cAnd I need...Jesus, do I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>A noise, growl-like in ferocity, ripped from Edgard; he took Trevor\u2019s mouth in a short, brutal kiss.</p><p>Their unrestrained behavior unleashed hers and she moaned.</p><p>Instantly Trevor was swarming her, all predatory male. \u201cI recognize that sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll please you, all right. Spread \u2019em wide, Chass, you know how I like it.\u201d</p><p>Her thighs parted and she arched her pelvis, letting him see the glistening wetness there.</p><p>\u201cAnd me?\u201d Edgard asked, somewhere off to the right.</p><p>Trevor\u2019s hot gaze never strayed from Chassie\u2019s. \u201cYou get to watch me lickin\u2019 the sweetest pussy in the world.\u201d He bent his head. One long lick. Followed by another. And another. Each lap of his tongue became shorter. More precise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She teetered so close to the edge of orgasm that Chassie clutched Trevor\u2019s hair in her fists, desperate for that headlong rush into pleasure.</p><p>He looked up. \u201cNo hands. Ed make sure her hands stay outta my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist.\u201d Edgard circled both her wrists in one strong hand, pinning them above her head. His face was inches from hers. \u201cLeave them so I can touch you. There will be consequences if you disobey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of consequences?\u201d</p> <p>Edgard didn\u2019t respond. His exhalations ruffled the damp skin of her neck as he placed his lips in the hollow of her throat.</p><p>Right then Trevor sucked on her clit.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d Her pelvis pushed forward to force additional contact with that sucking mouth.</p><p>But Edgard\u2019s hand slid down her belly and the activity on her clit stopped.</p><p>She lifted her head and saw silent communication pass between them. Trevor fluttered just his tongue over that throbbing bit of flesh.</p> <p>A wet lash on the very tip of her nipple made her cry out. It happened again. And again. Delicate licks interspersed with gentle, fleeting sucks. It was heaven. It was hell.</p><p>The dual tongue flicks on separate needy areas were like nothing she\u2019d ever experienced. Wet heat swirled from her chest to her crotch until the pulses synchronized, and she came, gasping, writhing, and damn near screaming. Her whole body throbbed.</p><p>Throbbed. Not just her pussy, not just her nipples, every single inch of her skin buzzed.</p><p>As she struggled for air, soft lips brushed her mouth in a passing kiss. Once. Twice.</p><p>Three times.</p><p>Chassie blinked her eyes and Edgard kept his gaze on hers. He murmured in Portuguese and nuzzled her jawline before straightening up.</p> <p>Trevor rested on his knees and kept a grip on the top of each of her thighs. He grinned and licked his lips with great gusto. \u201cMmm. Mmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a taste.\u201d</p><p>Both Trevor and Chassie looked at Edgard as he angled forward and kissed Trevor.</p><p>Edgard broke free and challenged, \u201cMaybe next time I can get it directly from the source.\u201d</p><p>An odd sensation unfurled in her belly when Edgard came closer. He did that seductive nuzzle again, all warm breath and teasing caress of hot skin. He pressed his mouth to her ear and whispered, \u201cSweet Chassie. I want to fuck your husband. And then I want to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Edgard wanted to pounce on Trevor. Bend him over the mattress and pound into that tight little ass so hard Trevor would be walking bowlegged for days.</p><p>\u201cChass,\u201d he whispered loud enough for Trevor to hear, \u201cdo you have a strap-on dildo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Oh God, I like your lips right there, Ed.\u201d</p><p>Edgard smiled and sucked a little harder on the tendon straining in her neck. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have any sex toys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell yeah. A couple of different vibrators. Flavored lube. Handcuffs. Rope. A velvet mask. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you so curious?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>He straightened up. \u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s cheekbones were flushed with color, his pale blue eyes intent as he nodded.</p><p>Want want want kept echoing in Edgard\u2019s head whenever he was near the man.</p><p>Edgard inhaled and exhaled slowly before answering. \u201cI wondered if Chassie ever used a strap-on on you.\u201d</p><p>Something dark and unidentifiable quickened in Trevor\u2019s eyes. \u201cNo. Not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the only thing I\u2019ve ever wanted, or ever had up my ass, is your cock, Ed. It was you or nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Edgard couldn\u2019t stop from reaching for him. Touching those strong arms and that vulnerable face. \u201cNext time I wanna look in your eyes while I\u2019m fucking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr when it\u2019s my turn to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>A heated pause filled the air. Edgard nodded. \u201cRight now I believe hands and knees will be best for everyone.\u201d</p><p>Chassie lifted halfway and reclined on her elbows. \u201cDo you want me just to watch this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Edgard and Trevor said simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cGood. Although, I\u2019m probably gonna wish we were in front of a mirror so I can see the looks on both your faces as you\u2019re together again.\u201d Another one of those mysterious expressions crossed her pretty face before her gaze skittered away.</p><p>Trevor was highly intuitive when it came to his wife, because he immediately crawled across the bed until he hung over Chassie\u2019s prone body. \u201cBaby? What\u2019s goin\u2019 on? Tell me. No more secrets, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you still want to be with me? After you\u2019re with Edgard? After he gives you what you really want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now. I\u2019ve had what I wanted the minute you agreed to become my wife.\u201d</p><p>Edgard tried not to intrude. He didn\u2019t want to be hurt by Trevor\u2019s declaration, even when it was the truth, but it sliced clear to the bone.</p><p>\u201cThis is all so confusing,\u201d Chassie whispered. \u201cI love you, Trevor. I don\u2019t wanna lose you. I\u2019ll do anything to make you happy. Anything. I can\u2019t expect you not to feel something for him when you so obviously do. And I don\u2019t think what I\u2019m feelin\u2019 is jealousy at seein\u2019 you with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust plain old fear I\u2019ll come up lacking again when he and I are compared.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Damn. Damn. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop. I\u2019ll go,\u201d Edgard said softly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working for you, Chassie, and I won\u2019t hurt you again. Not ever. Not for anything. Not even for a shot at\u201d\u2014the only man I\u2019ve loved\u2014\u201cbeing with Trevor.\u201d</p><p>Chassie shook her head and grabbed Edgard\u2019s hand. \u201cSee? This isn\u2019t what I wanted either. I won\u2019t cast you out like some soap opera diva, even though I\u2019m feelin\u2019 like one, laying here dissecting this situation when I should just go with it.\u201d</p><p>He studied Chassie, flat-out amazed by her. By her generosity, by her caring and concern not for herself, but for Trevor. For him. For what they\u2019d lost.</p><p>Trevor hadn\u2019t moved. He hadn\u2019t taken his eyes off his wife. \u201cEd is right. We can stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She squeezed Edgard\u2019s hand. \u201cI won\u2019t do that to any of us. God, I\u2019m thrilled you\u2019re wantin\u2019 me to be a part of it and not sneakin\u2019 off to the barn when I\u2019ve got my back turned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChassie, darlin\u2019, we\u2019d never do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that? Don\u2019t you think I know how damn... noble you both are? Don\u2019t you think that makes me feel like shit for stopping this before you even get started? When I know it\u2019s killin\u2019 both of you?\u201d</p><p>Edgard attempted a different approach. \u201cWhile noble is hardly the word I\u2019d use to describe anything happening in a barn...I will ask if you were having fun with both of us before, when we were both touching you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t think beyond that right now.\u201d Edgard brushed his mouth across her knuckles. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do. Live in the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me after I\u2019ve gotten what I\u2019ve been dreaming of for the last three and a half years. Ask me when I walk down that hallway and go to bed alone and he\u2019s in your arms all night.\u201d</p><p>Another weighty pause hung; no one budged, no one seemed to breathe.</p><p>Chassie\u2019s lips curled into a watery smile as she touched Edgard\u2019s face. \u201cSounds like we oughta be pissed off at Trevor for makin\u2019 both of us love him. The jerk is gettin\u2019 the best of both worlds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a bit of a bastard,\u201d Edgard said with mock sternness.</p><p>\u201cHey, I can\u2019t help that I\u2019m such a damn loveable bastard.\u201d Trevor kissed Chassie\u2019s forehead and rubbed his cheek against Edgard\u2019s. \u201cI have an idea. If you still wanna do this.\u201d</p><p>Edgard made himself nod rather than shout out, Fuck yeah we\u2019re still doing this.</p><p>\u201cFlat on your back, Chass. Let\u2019s prop your hips under a bunch of pillows. So I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 her like this and you\u2019re behind me. That way she can see my face and yours, Ed.\u201d</p><p>He refocused on Chassie. \u201cWill that work, baby? So it ain\u2019t like we\u2019re pullin\u2019 train on you and you\u2019re in the lead car with no idea what\u2019s goin\u2019 on in the caboose? So you can look in my eyes and I can look in yours while we\u2019re all lovin\u2019 each other?\u201d</p><p>Again, Edgard realized Trevor\u2019s instincts were dead on when it came to his wife.</p><p>What had Trevor understood about him that he\u2019d never bothered to share? What else had he assumed about this man but had never taken the time to verify? Edgard\u2019s tendency to blame everything on Trevor had been part of the problem, a problem he hadn\u2019t acknowledged until right now.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds way better than a mirror,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab the pillows from my room.\u201d Edgard needed a second to clear his head. He paced, letting his conflicting emotions wash through him before he had to don the mask of casualness.</p><p>He returned to see Trevor\u2019s face buried between Chassie\u2019s thighs again, but he was on his knees, not flat on his belly. Edgard clutched the pillows to his chest until Chassie quit giggling and they both noticed him.</p><p>Talk about awkward. \u201cMaybe I should...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab the stuff outta the nightstand while I finish proppin\u2019 up this pretty pussy.\u201d</p><p>Trevor snatched the pillows.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s anticipation was waning. Until he saw the brand of lubricant he and Trevor had always used. Strange, that a squeeze bottle of lube would bolster his spirits, but it did.</p><p>He turned around and Trevor was right in his face.</p><p>Trevor spread his hands over Edgard\u2019s chest, digging his fingertips into the springy hair. \u201cWe seemed to have lost our momentum. Maybe this\u2019ll get it back.\u201d Trevor\u2019s mouth ate at his as he rubbed their cocks together.</p><p>The swollen heads were bumping and sliding, mixing the slick beads of pre-come on bare bellies until Edgard couldn\u2019t stand it. He wanted to bury his cock in Trevor\u2019s heat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Feel Trevor\u2019s body clamping around him. Hear the surprised moans rumbling from Trevor\u2019s chest every time he nailed that gland as he rode him.</p><p>When Edgard began to grind with more force, Trevor broke away. His eyes said everything his mouth couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be gentle, meu amore.\u201d Edgard brushed his lips over the shell of Trevor\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cAt least until you beg me not to be.\u201d</p> <p>Trevor shuddered.</p><p>Edgard wouldn\u2019t be denied this bit of foreplay. He tugged on Trevor\u2019s earlobe with his teeth, not bothering to hide his ragged breathing. \u201cGet in position so I can touch you.\u201d</p><p>Trevor levered his body over Chassie. He stole a kiss and her slender fingers curled into his shoulders as he pushed inside her.</p><p>While Chassie and Trevor rocked together, Edgard knelt in the space between Trevor\u2019s calves and rolled on a condom. He squirted lube on his fingers and coated his cock.</p><p>Trevor\u2019s beautiful, strong back, ridged with muscles, was stretched out before him like a feast. Edgard rubbed his stubbled cheek and chin over the arched section of Trevor\u2019s lower spine, reacquainting himself with the feel and the scent of Trevor\u2019s skin.</p> <p>He slowly ran his tongue up Trevor\u2019s backbone, refreshing his memory of the taste of Trevor\u2019s sweat. In the years they were together, he always wanted to fuck Trevor before Trevor washed off the grime of rodeo, loving that distinctive dusty, salty, leathery tang.</p><p>Ignoring his own pounding heart, Edgard nipped the tips of Chassie\u2019s fingers, still clutching Trevor\u2019s shoulders. He traced the path of Trevor\u2019s spine down, not stopping at the cleft of his ass, but zeroing in on that puckered hole.</p><p>Even as Trevor automatically clenched, he tipped his hips up, wanting more. Edgard swept his finger over the most sensitive portion of the outer ring of muscle. When he felt that pucker relax, he slipped just one finger in.</p><p>Trevor lifted his head from Chassie\u2019s neck and groaned.</p><p>Didn\u2019t take long before one finger became two. It also didn\u2019t long for Trevor to start thrusting back instead of forward.</p><p>He removed his fingers and kissed the scars on Trevor\u2019s back. The one from Tulsa.</p> <p>The one from Cheyenne. When Edgard reached the one he\u2019d given Trevor in Denver, courtesy of a broken beer bottle and his temper, he dragged his mouth over it several times. Edgard pushed back to his knees and, without warning, grabbed a butt cheek in each hand, pulled them apart and fit himself into Trevor\u2019s ass in a single smooth glide.</p><p>They both hissed.</p><p>When Edgard began to thrust, he followed the rhythm Trevor had set with Chassie, long and slow. Too slow.</p><p>Chassie gasped, \u201cTrevor, move faster.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Edgard knew to cut loose. His strokes grew deeper. He curled his hand on Trevor\u2019s hips for leverage. Needing a deeper angle, he slid his left palm up to Trevor\u2019s shoulders only to encounter another hand. Chassie\u2019s.</p><p>Their passion-fueled gazes clashed and she laced their fingers together and they held on to the man they loved. Edgard\u2019s head spun at the eroticism of fucking Trevor while holding Chassie\u2019s hand and looking into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShit. More. Ed. Come on. I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 close.\u201d</p><p>Edgard pulled all the way out of that clenching channel and slammed in. Once.</p> <p>Twice. Thrice. Four deep strokes. Trevor\u2019s anal muscles became vise-like, clamping down on Edgard\u2019s cock as he pumped into Chassie.</p><p>Chassie arched beneath Trevor, grinding her sex side-to-side until she came with a surprised gasp.</p><p>The visual and physical stimulation was too much and Edgard came in a long groan of satisfaction, his cock motionless inside Trevor as those tight muscles did all the work, milking every hot spurt. Edgard rested his head in the space below Trevor\u2019s neck, rubbing his cheek over the damp skin, letting that salty scent coat his face. When his breathing leveled out, he licked Trevor\u2019s hairline, placing a kiss below his ear. \u201cStill good as ever,\u201d he murmured and slowly pulled out of that molten heat.</p><p>Trevor tossed all the pillows to the floor and stretched out on top of Chassie, burying his face in her neck.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Chassie didn\u2019t appear to mind Trevor\u2019s full weight on her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t appear either noticed when he left them and snuck back to his room alone.</p><p>Chassie didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d fare facing Edgard, if things would be awkward or what. She took care of Greta early the next morning. She made a list of supplies and sat down at the kitchen table with her first cup of coffee when Edgard entered the kitchen.</p><p>Good Lord was the man magnificent. He rarely sported a scruffy morning beard, preferring to be freshly shaven and cleaned up, but not in a fussy, prissy way. She smiled.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019. Would you like coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d When she started to get up, he waved her back. \u201cNo need to wait on me. I\u2019m used to fending for myself.\u201d Edgard took a cup off the dishrack, filled it and grabbed the milk from the fridge before he sat across from her.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know after I\u2019m fully awake.\u201d Once he\u2019d doctored his coffee to his liking, he drank half in one gulp. \u201cAh. Better.\u201d His golden eyes focused on her. \u201cHow is Greta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. She is the oddest little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s curious as a kitten. Gets remorseful when your tone is stern. She\u2019s playful and affectionate.\u201d</p><p>Edgard grinned. \u201cI did good in picking her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. I can\u2019t believe I actually have a goat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you checked cattle yet?\u201d</p><p>Chassie shook her head and stood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to help since I don\u2019t have anything else to do.\u201d</p><p>She reached for the coffee pot, refilling both their cups. She stopped behind him and studied the sweep of his dark hair. Edgard\u2019s words from last night had haunted her after she\u2019d woken up in Trevor\u2019s arms and found Edgard gone. On impulse, she set her chin on his head, wrapping her arms around his neck. Damn he smelled good. Felt good too.</p><p>\u201cLast night was great. Thank you for...\u201d</p><p>Shoot. Were there words to explain? Thank you for offering reassurance you weren\u2019t trying to steal my man? Thank you for fucking my husband right in front of me and not behind my back? Thank you for making me feel sexy and like you really wanted me there and I wasn\u2019t an annoying byproduct of getting it on with Trevor?</p><p>\u201cThank you for what, Chassie?\u201d he asked hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cThank you for everything. Especially when you were so sweet when I was worried, you know, me having a personal crisis, freaking out last night...\u201d Take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cDammit. I\u2019m so bad at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I oughta be thanking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we oughta talk about something else.\u201d Chassie kissed his crown and squeezed his body one last time before she returned to her own seat. \u201cSo you goin\u2019 into town to see if your truck is done?\u201d</p><p>His coffee cup stopped midair. When Edgard looked at her she realized he\u2019d misunderstood. She covered his hand on the table with hers, which had clenched into a fist at her thoughtless blathering. \u201cI\u2019m not tryin\u2019 to get rid of you, Ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, in fact, I\u2019d like it if you stuck around for a while. Trevor never wants to admit we need help, but with calvin\u2019 startin\u2019 in the next couple weeks, and we can\u2019t afford to hire a hand, even temporarily...well, we\u2019d\u2014 I\u2019d\u2014like it if you stayed.\u201d It clicked he had a ranch of his own to run half a world away and she amended, \u201cUnless of course you can\u2019t and you need to get back to Brazil.\u201d</p><p>Edgard drained his coffee. \u201cNo place I need to be, so if you want me to stick around, I will.\u201d He scrambled to his feet, giving her his back. \u201cDoes Trevor know you asked me to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But do you really think he\u2019s gonna complain after last night?\u201d</p><p>He spun and gave her a smug smile. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019d let the ritual of pouring coffee settle the unease between them, Chassie said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you slept alone.\u201d</p><p>Edgard shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven when you were traveling with Trevor?\u201d</p><p>He expelled an exasperated sigh. \u201cChassie, is this something you really wanna hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something I need to hear if you\u2019re in our life.\u201d</p><p>Our life seemed to jar him. \u201cYou are just as damn curious as Greta, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse. And I\u2019ll warn you I\u2019m stubborn as a mule and tenacious as a bulldog. I\u2019ll keep pesterin\u2019 you until your answers suit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve got nothin\u2019 to lose if I ask these questions and everything to lose if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>A considering look crossed Edgard\u2019s face. \u201cYou are wise beyond your years, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel much older than twenty-five, that\u2019s for damn sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet, you don\u2019t look a day over eighteen,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Chassie rolled her eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t need extra sugar in your coffee this mornin\u2019, your mouth is already so damn sweet, so start spillin\u2019 your guts.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cMost nights on the road, after Trevor and I hooked up, Trevor and I slept in the same bed. Unless he and Colby were out or if they were entertaining buckle bunnies in our motel room. Then I crashed in the horse trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you jealous? When he was with women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d Edgard dumped another spoonful of sugar in his coffee. \u201cMostly I was accustomed to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever, oh, go fuck another guy and rub it in his face afterward?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem surprised by the question. \u201cOnce.\u201d</p><p>When Edgard didn\u2019t elaborate, Chassie waved her hand in front of his face to snag his attention. \u201cCome on, Ed. This is juicy stuff. You can\u2019t stop now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe were at the Denver Stock Show. Somehow I ended up going to dinner with Trevor and his family. His brother Brent started talking shit about a hired hand who\u2019d recently come out. Brent spewed all these dumb gay jokes. Normally, I ignore that kinda behavior, consider the source and all that. But Trevor drank too much\u2014like he always does when he\u2019s forced to deal with his family\u2014and he joined in, acting like a homophobic prick because that\u2019s what his family expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could I do? I was beyond pissed off. Trevor not telling anyone about us was always a big issue between us. I understood his reasons and never pushed it. But when he made fun of guys who had the balls to come out of the closet? That was a line he shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve crossed. I hated he\u2019d done it in front of me.\u201d Edgard shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cAfter dinner, the whole family loaded up and went to the big rodeo dance. I declined.</p> <p>\u201cI burned my bootheels getting to the gay cowboy bar in Denver and hooked up with a dentist who was in town for the rodeo. I spent the night in his hotel room and didn\u2019t see Trevor until the following afternoon when we had to compete.\u201d</p><p>Chassie figured she wouldn\u2019t much care for Trevor\u2019s jealous reaction, but she wouldn\u2019t be surprised by it.</p><p>\u201cWe sucked in the arena. Lost our chance for points or purse. Soon as we were alone he lit into me. We fought. Not with words. With our fists. We beat the shit out of each other, Chass. It was ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d it happen? Since you were always so discreet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the living quarters of the horse trailer. Trev said something. I said something back. He took the first punch. I landed the last. Christ, we were rolling around on the floor, bleeding\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhoa\u2014bleeding?\u201d</p><p>Edgard closed his eyes. \u201cWhen we were shoving each other some beer bottles got broken and we just kept going, stomping all over them. Trevor slipped and fell and I didn\u2019t help him up, I just kept beating on him. So he has a cut on his back and I have a gash on my arm as a memento.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t comment since she couldn\u2019t imagine the frustration they\u2019d been dealing with before Edgard stepped out on Trevor.</p><p>\u201cColby damn near had to break down the door. He threatened to find new traveling partners if we didn\u2019t get a handle on the situation. Somehow we reassured him we\u2019d deal with it, but that was the beginning of the end for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor wanted to be with me only on his terms. I was tired of the secret life and the lies it took to maintain it. At the time...I couldn\u2019t see past my self-righteous streak that I wasn\u2019t gonna hide who I was from anyone any more.\u201d</p> <p>At the time? Strange way to phrase it. \u201cThe dentist reminded you of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe reminded me lots of men live together openly. Did I engage in a one-night stand to hurt Trevor? Probably. But it ended up hurting me too because it gave me a taste of what I could never have. At least not with Trevor. I\u2019d never been into the multiple partner, circle jerk, meaningless fast encounters in the clubs or bathrooms. I\u2019ve always been...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChoosy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s just not the norm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDag was so far in the closet he suffocated in there,\u201d Chassie said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what normal is. I\u2019d rather be hurt by upfront honesty than hurt by a long-standing lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to think that too.\u201d Edgard picked at the plastic seam in the tablecloth.</p> <p>Finally Chassie\u2019s nerves couldn\u2019t stand whatever he was hiding. She covered his hand with hers. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Dag that night I was in the gay bar in Denver.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach swirled her coffee into a frothy latte. \u201cWho was he with? Shit. No, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d She inhaled. \u201cYes. Tell me. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA skinny, young Goth looking kid. No one I knew. No one from the circuit. No one I\u2019d ever seen, which wasn\u2019t surprising. They were dancing...and dammit, Chassie. I don\u2019t wanna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me. He\u2019s dead and I realized too late that I barely knew him or his life outside of here.\u201d</p><p>Edgard locked his gaze to hers. \u201cDag looked happier than I\u2019d ever seen him.</p><p>Comfortable in his own skin. After seeing him smiling and relaxed with that twinkie, I knew why he\u2019d been so damn combative on the circuit.\u201d</p><p>Hot tears sparked in her eyes. \u201cThe last year he was so angry. And drunk. God. He was always drunk and when he was home he and Daddy were always at each other\u2019s throats. I\u2019d\u2019ve given anything to see him happy just one time. Did he recognize you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Dag didn\u2019t see me. And I was used to dealing with Trevor and his secrecy and denial so I never let on I saw him.\u201d He sighed. \u201cHell. I never even told Trevor I saw Dag, Chass. But it stuck in my head and eight months later I returned to Brazil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s been no one since Trevor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Edgard hedged. \u201cI tried a couple random encounters in Sao Paulo and I felt...worse than when I was obsessed with getting laid. I met a guy, Reynaldo, who did some remodeling for me. We hooked up, we were out, but it was casual. Six months into it I took Rey home to meet my mother and the rest of my family. He knew my heart wasn\u2019t in it, even when I never mentioned Trevor to him.\u201d</p><p>Chassie frowned. \u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>Edgard shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened when you took him home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother didn\u2019t like him.\u201d His humor vanished. \u201cThen she died and everything went to hell. Reynaldo...\u201d He scrubbed his hands on his scalp. \u201cChassie, can we stop talking about this now? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s probably smart,\u201d Trevor said as he sidled into the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your ma, Ed. I know how close you were to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Trevor poured the last of the coffee in his mug and shut off the pot. \u201cCattle been fed yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But Greta has.\u201d</p><p>He scowled, but it was playful, not mean. \u201cDamn goat\u2019s probably eatin\u2019 better than us.\u201d Trevor put his hand on Edgard\u2019s shoulder; more loverly than friendly. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the cattle. You comin\u2019 along to help me?\u201d</p><p>Edgard beamed from Trevor\u2019s simple affectionate gesture. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>They belong together. You can\u2019t come between them.</p><p>Chassie\u2019s inner vixen offered her jealous side a seductive dare, Oh yeah? Stick around and watch me because I plan on being between them a lot.</p><p>Yes, it was shaping up to be a very promising day.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>True to her mental promise, a couple hours after supper, as the three of them were watching TV, Chassie said casually, \u201cAnyone hungry?\u201d</p><p>She paused, waiting for them to look at her. When they did, she vamped, \u201cFor a Chassie sandwich?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Trevor said, \u201cI\u2019m famished. How about you, Ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could eat again.\u201d</p><p>The next thing Chassie knew, Trevor whooped, plucked her up and raced upstairs to the bedroom with Edgard hot on their heels.</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t gonna be a leisurely meal,\u201d Trevor said as he set her down.</p><p>Edgard added, \u201cMore like fast food.\u201d He whipped off his shirt, then went to work on his buckle.</p><p>Chassie noticed Trevor\u2019s socks balled up and his jeans undone.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha waitin\u2019 for, darlin\u2019? Strip.\u201d</p><p>Her fine motor skills suffered when faced with the reality of these two hot, naked men. Her face heated. Her heart pounded. She just...froze. Yeah. Big talker. Taunting them and acting like petrified wood as she realized both those big cocks would be buried inside her.</p><p>\u201cLemme help.\u201d Edgard unbuttoned her blouse, kissing each inch of skin he bared.</p><p>When he reached the last button, he fell to his knees and worked on her jeans.</p><p>Trevor moved in behind her and slid her shirt off. His lips trailed across the slope of her shoulder as he unhooked her bra, dragging the straps down her arms. Edgard tugged until the denim pooled around her ankles.</p><p>Then three of them were buck-ass nekkid. Chassie was feeling unsure when Trevor spun her around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the condiments,\u201d Edgard said, causing Trevor\u2019s sharp bark of laugher.</p><p>\u201cSexy as it is to see you bitin\u2019 your lip, I know it\u2019s a sign of nerves. You changin\u2019 your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thinking about it is one thing; doing it is another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019ll give you something else to think about.\u201d Trevor\u2019s mouth came down on hers.</p><p>The fiery kiss and Trevor\u2019s hands on her breasts spiked her desire, chasing away her anxiety. She arched closer and almost forgot about Edgard until she felt his hands caressing her ass and his moist breath on the back of her neck.</p><p>They were relentless in building her need quickly. She couldn\u2019t think beyond roving hands and hot mouths and the sudden gush of wetness between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cBaby, let us have you, just like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStanding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. Put your foot up on the bed so Ed can getcha as ready in the back as you are in the front.\u201d</p><p>Slippery coolness brushed across her rectum as Edgard inserted a finger. With his left hand gripping her left hip, he methodically swept his thumb across the dimple above her butt causing goose bumps to tingle up and down her spine.</p><p>And Trevor kissed her in that single-minded manner that made it seem he was kissing her entire body, not just her mouth.</p><p>\u201cOne more, Chassie, don\u2019t tighten up,\u201d Edgard spoke near her ear and added another finger to her ass.</p><p>With four fingers stretching her, Chassie nipped Trevor\u2019s bottom lip as she retreated from the kiss. \u201cThen I\u2019m ready for my drive-thru special.\u201d</p><p>Both men chuckled against her, making her whole body vibrate anew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEd? You suited up?\u201d Trevor asked without breaking eye contact with Chassie.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Trevor scooped her up and placed her legs around his waist. \u201cFor this first time we\u2019ll go in separately. Next time, I wanna see your face as we ram into you together.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t doubt there\u2019d be a next time and she couldn\u2019t wait to experience every bit of pleasure these two men could offer her. She lowered onto Trevor\u2019s cock and tipped her head back with a heartfelt moan. \u201cDamn. That\u2019s always so good.\u201d</p><p>Trevor pulled her butt cheeks apart so Edgard could line his cock up. \u201cRock your hips back a little, baby. Good. Like that.\u201d Just the cockhead popped in through the tight ring of muscles and she tensed.</p><p>\u201cRelax, naughty girl. Ain\u2019t no shame in admitting you like taking it up the ass.\u201d</p><p>Edgard sank his teeth into her nape and pushed past her resistance until he was completely in.</p><p>Chassie gasped at the full, hot sensation. She squeezed her muscles and both men groaned.</p><p>\u201cBaby, is it okay for us to move?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, even when she wanted the time to wallow in every pulse and throb of their cocks filling her. She needed hours to writhe between the two sweaty, hard male chests.</p><p>Trevor pulled out. When he thrust back in to the halfway point, Edgard withdrew.</p><p>Slowly. And Chassie knew they could feel the head of each other\u2019s cocks between the thin walls of tissue as they thrust into her body oh-so-slowly.</p><p>She wrapped one arm around Trevor\u2019s neck as the pace quickened. He kissed her, swallowing her surprised humming moans. When Trevor\u2019s lips slid to the side of her throat and Edgard\u2019s mouth was there too, they closed the gap so their mouths could connect. The kiss was pacifying, not what she\u2019d expected. A primal, powerful feeling overtook her at seeing these two strong, controlled men, together with such abandon.</p><p>Fucking her with abandon.</p><p>\u201cLike that. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>A teasing side-to-side grind had Trevor\u2019s pubic hair rasping over her distended clit.</p><p>Chassie couldn\u2019t hold off. The small orgasm expanded into a breath-stealing, blood-throbbing climax when Edgard yanked her hair, fully exposing the sweet spot of her throat for Trevor to suck on as Edgard nipped at the curve where her shoulder met her neck. They plunged in tandem. Hard. Deep. Perfectly timed.</p><p>Her world boiled down to gripping hands and hungry mouths and the push/pull of all that male hardness stretching her as every inch between her hips and her thighs pulsed.</p><p>The rapid clenching of her interior muscles brought impatient masculine growls and pistoning hips. No words were spoken as they came simultaneously. Trevor\u2019s seed bathed her insides. Edgard\u2019s movements stilled; his cock twitched against the snug channel of her ass. She wished he wasn\u2019t wearing a condom so she feel that same molten heat coating the walls of her anal passage.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s sweaty forehead landed on her nape and Trevor buried his nose in her neck.</p><p>Their labored breathing drifted across her skin, creating a fresh set of goose bumps through the warmth radiating from their bodies.</p><p>Trevor followed the line of her throat up to her mouth and kissed her. \u201cDidja like your sandwich, baby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm. It appears my bread is gettin\u2019 wilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho you callin\u2019 wilty?\u201d Trevor mock-growled and thrust his hips a couple times.</p><p>Shoot, her head was muzzy. She\u2019d meant to say lettuce was getting wilty, meaning her.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s too polite to tell us she really wants a double-stacker,\u201d Edgard said silkily as he snapped his pelvis. \u201cWe\u2019re more than happy to oblige your appetites, Chass.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Chassie noticed neither cock inside her had softened completely. \u201cDid you guys take Viagra or something?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her, Trevor said, \u201cYou\u2019re on the bottom this time, buddy.\u201d He captured Chassie\u2019s gasp in his mouth as Edgard pulled out.</p><p>Still keeping her wrapped around his torso, still kissing her, still touching her with tender reverence, Trevor backed them toward the bed. The sound of running water echoed from the bathroom and a minute later Edgard emerged.</p><p>He reached for another condom. But Trevor snatched it and set Chassie on her feet.</p><p>\u201cI wanna see her puttin\u2019 that on you.\u201d Trevor flashed her a wicked grin. \u201cWith her mouth.\u201d</p><p>Gently pressing on Chassie\u2019s shoulder, Trevor watched her drop to her knees. After she was between them, he said, \u201cSuck on him, baby. I wanna see what you can do to Ed\u2019s cock.\u201d</p><p>She eyed the foreskin.</p><p>\u201cJust pull it back and hold it at the base to get to the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should give me an up close and personal demonstration,\u201d Chassie challenged.</p><p>Trevor crouched beside her. He circled his fingers around the tip of Edgard\u2019s cock and pushed the skin back, exposing the plump purple head. \u201cSee? Like that.\u201d</p><p>Chassie tickled the slit with the very tip of her pink tongue. When Trevor tried to stand, Chassie clamped her hand on his wrist. \u201cMaybe you should help me.\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah. Two hot, wet tongues on his prick would drive Edgard wild. Trevor loved to get the upper hand with the domineering man, and getting to kiss his wife at the same time they teased their lover? What a bonus. He whispered, \u201cWatch,\u201d and sucked Edgard to the root.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s entire body twitched.</p><p>Right after Trevor released every glorious inch of that uncut cock, Chassie took her turn, drawing Edgard\u2019s length to the back of the throat. She swallowed and retreated.</p><p>They alternated twice more, but when Trevor\u2019s lips opened to receive the head again, Chassie placed her mouth on the other side and tangled her tongue with Trevor\u2019s in an openmouthed kiss.</p><p>Kissing each other and the tip of Edgard\u2019s cock at the same time was one of the most erotic things Trevor had ever done.</p><p>\u201cSweet mother of God,\u201d Edgard groaned.</p><p>So they tortured him with wet tongue flicks, soft sucking and nips from two sets of teeth. All the while looking in each other\u2019s eyes, competing to see who could wring a louder moan from the Brazilian. Working his cock and balls together, sneaking kisses until Edgard clutched their hair in his hands and jerked them away.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he croaked. \u201cPut the goddamn condom on.\u201d</p><p>Ripping open the package, Trevor held the circle of latex in front of Chassie\u2019s lips and she rolled it down Edgard\u2019s dick with her mouth. Trevor couldn\u2019t fathom getting any harder than he was right at that moment.</p><p>With a sound akin to a growl, Edgard latched onto Chassie\u2019s hips and they fell back on the bed with him on the bottom and his legs dangling on the side of the mattress.</p><p>She spun and pinned Edgard\u2019s hands above his head. \u201cLeave \u2019em there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. So you think you get to be the boss now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Chassie impaled herself and pressed her tits to his chest, rubbing on him like a cat. \u201cI love the way your chest hair feels on my nipples.\u201d</p><p>Trevor watched the muscles in Edgard\u2019s throat tighten as he arched his neck, lost in the nipple play he loved. Coating himself with lubrication, Trevor stopped Chassie\u2019s rocking motion. He aligned his slicked-up cock to her sweet little rosebud, gritting his teeth at the pleasure as he breached the resistance and slid into her tight passage to the hilt.</p><p>Savor it, warred with, she\u2019s loose and ready, fuck her like there\u2019s no tomorrow.</p><p>Trevor held his breath, not sure which action would win out.</p><p>But she was too busy tormenting Edgard to give him a cue, so he waited, watched and ground his molars into dust.</p><p>\u201cCan I move now, Trev?\u201d Chassie asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. However you want, baby. You\u2019re in charge. I\u2019m just along for the ride.\u201d</p><p>Edgard said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell her that. She\u2019ll torture us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best way to torture you, Mr. Dirty Talk, is to not let you be in charge,\u201d Chassie retorted.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already got your number, Ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it sixty-nine?\u201d</p><p>Chassie laughed. \u201cJust for that smartass answer. I\u2019m gonna go slow. Real slow. Not-let-you-come-for-a-long-time kind of slow.\u201d</p><p>True to her word, his wife kept the pace slow enough Trevor had ample time to lube up his fingers. He reached down and slipped both into Edgard\u2019s ass.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s eyes flew open. Trevor\u2019s heart melted at the blatant love he saw in those tawny depths. This was so perfect, so right, the three of them loving on each other. And for once Trevor didn\u2019t hide his face or his emotions from Edgard either. He let them shine through.</p><p>That\u2019s all it took. Edgard whispered his name, bucked his hips, bore down on Trevor\u2019s fingers and came with a hissing moan. Trevor and Chassie weren\u2019t far behind.</p><p>Edgard took his time using the small master bathroom after Trevor and Chassie finished their turns. He tossed the condom, washed his hands and face, and managed to avoid looking at himself in the mirror.</p><p>When he returned to the bedroom, the lights were off, save for the low wattage lamp glowing on the far nightstand. Trevor and Chassie were already in bed. Dammit. How was he supposed to find his clothes in the dark?</p><p>He\u2019d tried being quiet as he searched for his briefs, but Chassie heard him rummaging around and sat up. He whispered, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Can you turn off the light before you come to bed?\u201d</p><p>Come to bed? Surely she didn\u2019t mean...?</p><p>Edgard didn\u2019t budge until Chassie held out her hand to him. \u201cYes, with us. Might be a tight fit.\u201d Her smile lit up the room even in the near darkness and sparked something deep inside him he was half-afraid might actually be hope.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would. Before you ask, the invite is for all nights, not just tonight.</p><p>Don\u2019t think for a second this is asked out of pity.\u201d She looked over at her snoring husband. \u201cWe both want you here. Some of us are just better at putting it into words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s workin\u2019 on it,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cHe\u2019ll get there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know that too, querida. And I\u2019m also aware I have you to thank for getting him this far.\u201d</p><p>After clicking off the light, Edgard climbed in beside Trevor. He closed his eyes at the familiar feel of Trevor\u2019s warm body and the unfamiliar feel of Chassie\u2019s hand enclosed in his.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Edgard.\u201d</p> <p>He choked out, \u201c\u2019Night,\u201d over the lump in his throat and wondered if they\u2019d notice the tear stains on his pillowcase come morning.</p><p>A raging hard-on and Trevor\u2019s lips brushing his nipples woke Edgard from a deep sleep. He cracked his eyes open, expecting it to be another damn dream.</p><p>Nope. Trevor looked down at him and said huskily, \u201cWant you. Want you bad.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s gaze landed on Chassie curled up on Trevor\u2019s other side. \u201cIs she...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleepin\u2019? Yep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould she be okay with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s ask.\u201d Trevor ran his hand down the outside line of her naked body. \u201cChass?</p><p>Baby, you awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if Edgard and I screw around a little bit this mornin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She mumbled, \u201cNo. Just don\u2019t bounce me off the bed.\u201d</p> <p>Trevor rolled on top of Edgard so they touched from head to toe and everywhere in between.</p><p>The everywhere in between caused the contraction in Edgard\u2019s groin. He traced the bend in Trevor\u2019s waist and canted his hips, his hands clutching Trevor\u2019s ass as Trevor began to move slowly.</p><p>\u201cJust like this,\u201d Trevor growled, rubbing their cocks together in a sweet glide. \u201cLike the first time. You made me do all the work.\u201d</p><p>Edgard pressed his mouth against Trevor\u2019s throat, licking at the throbbing pulse. \u201cI needed to be sure you wanted me so you couldn\u2019t claim afterward it was something I did to you.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s response was a soft snarl and he tipped his head to reach Edgard\u2019s mouth.</p><p>The hungry kiss belied the slow, methodical slide and grind of Trevor\u2019s cock against his. Edgard let the reality wash over him. He was really here with Trevor, skin-to-skin, making love in the predawn hours.</p><p>With Trevor\u2019s wife asleep in bed next to them.</p><p>Before his sleep-addled brain wrapped around that bizarre statement, the rubbing strokes became faster. Shaft-to-shaft, the friction of cockhead over cockhead, the intense kisses, the welcome weight of Trevor gyrating on top of him and Edgard groaned, shuddering at the punch of need he always felt for Trevor. Of rightness whenever they touched. As close as he was to orgasm, he didn\u2019t want this encounter to end.</p> <p>Trevor trilled his lips over Edgard\u2019s jaw to his ear. \u201cCome for me. Come on me.</p><p>Show me you like what I\u2019m doin\u2019 to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like everything you do to me. I always have. Since that first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen look at me. See what you do to me.\u201d</p><p>Edgard watched Trevor\u2019s eyes go opaque and his mouth slacken as he climaxed, leaving a blast of wet heat on Edgard\u2019s stomach.</p><p>Trevor kept rocking through the slickness, through his own orgasm, and buried his face in his favorite spot on Edgard\u2019s neck with a soft sigh.</p><p>Only then did Edgard let go, every heated pulse poignant as he wondered how he\u2019d ever walk away from this man again.</p><p>Three nights later, nestled between two hard male bodies, Chassie groaned. \u201cI swear to God I oughta be hearin\u2019 circus music we\u2019ve done it so many different ways.\u201d</p><p>Both Trevor and Edgard laughed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I am not complaining.\u201d She turned and kissed each man on the shoulder. \u201cThis has been hot and sexy and fun as hell. I never imagined the many, many, many positions we\u2019ve tried even existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Edgard prompted.</p><p>Chassie propped her chin on Trevor\u2019s damp chest, making room for Edgard to scoot in and tangle his legs with theirs. \u201cBut can we crash now? I\u2019m tired. We have to run errands in town tomorrow and I\u2019d rather not be walkin\u2019 funny and covered in love bites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I believe Ed and I are both sportin\u2019 your love bites, darlin\u2019.\u201d Trevor dragged his finger between Edgard\u2019s hipbones, stopping at the big red mark she\u2019d gifted Edgard with during a particularly frantic moment last night. \u201cIn fact, I think we both owe you a coupla love bites to even things up.\u201d</p><p>She muttered, \u201cI had to go and open my big mouth.\u201d</p><p>Edgard leaned over and bit her earlobe. \u201cWhat a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insatiable. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, you don\u2019t know the half of it. Now why don\u2019t you lay back and close your eyes? This won\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch,\u201d Edgard said and each sank their mouths into a different part of her body.</p><p>She screamed, but it wasn\u2019t in pain.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>\u201cMedium rare, basted, wheat toast, extra hash browns.\u201d Trevor closed the menu, handing it to the waitress with a smile.</p><p>Edgard said, \u201cGive me the same.\u201d</p><p>Chassie had already ordered and was scrutinizing the newspaper.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s new,\u201d Trevor said after the waitress disappeared. \u201cWonder where she\u2019s from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith that accent I\u2019d guess some place in the Ukraine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s unusually pretty with them icy white-blue eyes and dark skin. Think she\u2019s a natural blonde?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pervert,\u201d Chassie said without looking up.</p><p>\u201cJust tryin\u2019 to get your attention, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou both gave me plenty of attention last night.\u201d Chassie harrumphed and flipped the page.</p><p>Trevor grinned, knew it looked cocky and didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cThis is a cool place,\u201d Edgard commented as he checked out the restaurant.</p><p>Dewey\u2019s Delish Dish definitely embodied the diner atmosphere. Vinyl covered stools surrounded the curved counter, booths lined the walls, and an old-fashioned glass pie case packed with sweets rotated by the cash register. The colors weren\u2019t traditional black, red and chrome; instead Macie McKay redecorated in shades of brown, green with a splash of bronze. It was a classy joint while retaining the hometown feel. Trevor figured business must be booming if it was half-full at ten in the morning on a weekday.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cNot bad. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m rarin\u2019 to go.\u201d Ed reached for another packet of sugar on Trevor\u2019s side of the table, his voice dropped. \u201cYou sore?\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met. Trevor smirked at the sexy Brazilian. \u201cNope. I\u2019m rarin\u2019 to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex maniacs. Neither of you asked me if I\u2019m tired. Or if I\u2019m sore,\u201d Chassie grumbled with good humor.</p><p>Edgard leaned into her direct line of vision. \u201cChassie, sweetheart, are you tired?\u201d</p><p>Trevor followed suit and scooted closer. \u201cChassie, baby, are you sore?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twitched. \u201cIf I admit I am who\u2019s gonna kiss it and make it all better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d they said simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should draw straws to see who goes first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should let us take turns,\u201d Edgard offered.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe you should take both of us on at once and see if this go around we can both make you sore and tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSore in all the right spots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, she won\u2019t be able to get out of bed for days,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>Chassie\u2019s gaze went from Edgard\u2019s face to Trevor\u2019s. \u201cYou guys bet on how fast you can heat me up? Knowin\u2019 I\u2019ll shovel in my breakfast in record time because I\u2019m dyin\u2019 for you to create a Chassie sandwich when we get home?\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s cock went from interested to fully erect in about ten seconds. \u201cScrew eatin\u2019, I\u2019d rather screw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew that, I\u2019m starved.\u201d She sipped her coffee. \u201cBesides, anticipation is good for you\u2014Mr. Harder-Faster-Now. Don\u2019t you agree, Ed?\u201d</p><p>His shoulder hitch was noncommittal.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Ed and I oughta give you a front row seat on exactly how sore Ed can make me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Chass, knock it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys started it.\u201d She aimed a challenging smile at Edgard and dropped her voice so they strained to hear her. \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re off the hook. So, Mr. Dirty Talk, which way you wanna take me first? I\u2019m gonna take a wild guess and say that an ass man such as yourself\u2014\u201d</p><p>Edgard hissed, \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna pound into my ass while suckin\u2019 his cock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t taunt him \u2019cause he will make you pay for it,\u201d Trevor warned.</p><p>Chassie ignored him. \u201cOr do you want me suckin\u2019 your cock as Trev\u2019s givin\u2019 you the high hard one? Can\u2019t you feel it? Can\u2019t you see shootin\u2019 your load on my chest as Trevor\u2019s pumping his into you?\u201d</p><p>Just like that, Chassie pushed Edgard over the edge.</p><p>\u201cBig talk. You just earned yourself double trouble. Be prepared to face the consequences, querida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Bring it. Serves you both right. Thinkin\u2019 you can tease me any time you want and I can\u2019t turn the tables even once? Besides, we\u2019ve planned too much running around today to be screwin\u2019 around so we\u2019ll save my \u2018consequences\u2019 for after supper.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s response was silk encased in steel. \u201cWrong. You no longer get to make those decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I ever did.\u201d</p><p>A deep voice said, \u201cChassie?\u201d</p><p>Three sets of eyes zoomed to the edge of the booth. A man dressed in a black Carhartt coat held a baby girl wearing a bright pink cap and a tiny purple coat trimmed with pink fur.</p><p>\u201cKade!\u201d Chassie hopped up and hugged him, then cooed, \u201cAnd Princess Eliza.</p><p>Lookit you, girlie, you\u2019re gettin\u2019 so big.\u201d Chassie pointed to the open booth space beside Edgard. \u201cCan you join us?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust for a minute.\u201d Kade sat. Immediately Eliza clenched both hands in the newspaper and jerked it toward her as she squealed with glee. Kade distracted her by yanking off her hat and shoving the crumpled paper back at Chassie. \u201cWatch out for Little Miss Grabby Hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d Cups, silverware and napkins were relocated against the back wall.</p><p>Kade seemed to notice the others at the table. \u201cShit\u2014I mean shoot, Trevor, didn\u2019t see you there. How you doin\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. I don\u2019t hafta ask how you\u2019re doin\u2019, seein\u2019 the smile on your face is a mile wide whenever you look at this sweet thing.\u201d</p><p>Eliza whapped Kade in the face with the tassel on her hat. He patiently lowered the furry pink cap. \u201cTrue. I\u2019ve never been better.\u201d Kade\u2019s gaze zeroed in on Edgard.</p><p>\u201cThis is my old ropin\u2019 partner, Edgard.\u201d</p><p>Kade gave Edgard a quick nod. \u201cNice to meetcha. I\u2019m Kade McKay. Forgive me if I don\u2019t shake your hand, I don\u2019t have enough hands these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d Edgard said, smiling at Eliza, who\u2019d whipped the hat in his direction, batting her long eyelashes at him with a soft goo. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful. How old is she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s nine months and luckily she takes after her mama in the looks department.\u201d</p><p>Trevor bit back a laugh. He\u2019d been around the McKay family his whole life and that little doll was all McKay.</p><p>\u201cWhere you from?\u201d Kade asked.</p><p>\u201cBrazil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a trek. What\u2019re you doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatching up, goofing off. Visiting old rodeo pals. Trevor and I team roped on the M&amp;P circuit. I went back to my ranch right after Colby\u2019s accident in Cheyenne and figured out me\u2019n Trev weren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d Edgard added hastily, \u201cI meant, not making any progress in the standings. Been a few years since I\u2019d hit the States and since I had downtime I thought I\u2019d do a little sightseeing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I recognized your name, you traveled with Colby. So you must\u2019ve known Dag while you were on the circuit?\u201d</p><p>Edgard nodded. \u201cI roped with him once or twice. Sad situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s worked out in some ways.\u201d He looked from Trevor to Chassie. \u201cSo, when you two gonna add to the family cradle rolls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a while. Is she walkin\u2019 yet?\u201d Chassie asked, changing the subject.</p><p>Kade shuddered. \u201cNo, thank God. Although, she crawls as fast as a June bug and she\u2019s hard enough to keep track of.\u201d</p><p>Eliza bounced on his leg. \u201cDah! Dah, dah, dah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatcha need, sugar?\u201d Kade kissed the top of Eliza\u2019s dark head and slid the hat back to her. \u201cThis?\u201d</p><p>Happy gurgling baby sounds followed.</p> <p>Despite Chassie\u2019s deflection about the baby comment, Trevor noticed Chassie\u2019s expression soften at seeing her cousin so enamored with his child.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in Sundance for ages. You\u2019re still livin\u2019 outside of Moorcroft, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Normally I\u2019m on the ranch this time of day, but we\u2019re Mama\u2019s errand runners this mornin\u2019 so we hadta come inta town. Droppin\u2019 off stuff at the store next door for Aunt Indy before we head back home, ain\u2019t we, baby girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMamamamamamamama!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re seein\u2019 your mama soon.\u201d Kade smiled at his daughter\u2019s outburst and smooched Eliza\u2019s forehead again.</p><p>A surge of jealousy hit Trevor at Kade\u2019s casual, easy affection with Eliza. He wanted a baby\u2014boy, girl, didn\u2019t matter. He wanted to see that soft, sweet expression on Chassie\u2019s face as she looked upon their child.</p><p>\u201cSo Skylar isn\u2019t with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sky\u2019s slavin\u2019 at the factory, gearin\u2019 up for the launch of the herbal ointment line. She\u2019ll be sorry she missed seein\u2019 you, Chass. So you\u2019d better fill me in on what you\u2019ve been up to lately, \u2019cause you know she\u2019s gonna grill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. Workin\u2019. More workin\u2019. What about you? Besides hangin\u2019 out with two gorgeous girls day and night?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout the same. Hit a slow patch.\u201d He caught the hat before Eliza flung it off the table. She shrieked her displeasure.</p><p>\u201cWaitin\u2019 on calvin\u2019 ain\u2019t fun.\u201d</p><p>Kade\u2019s gaze flipped to Trevor. \u201cAin\u2019t that the way it goes? Hurry up and wait. Then it seems like you never have enough time or help. I ain\u2019t lookin\u2019 forward to a month of no sleep.\u201d He glanced down at Eliza, who was happily smacking her hands on the table.</p><p>\u201cThough I\u2019ll probably be more prepared this year after spendin\u2019 most nights up with Little Miss Insomnia here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re hopin\u2019 Ed will stick around and help out,\u201d Chassie said.</p><p>Edgard looked up. \u201cLike I said earlier, I got nothin\u2019 else going on. I\u2019ll stay as long as you want me.\u201d His meaning was clear, if only to Trevor.</p><p>\u201cHey, Chass, have you heard from Keely lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p>Kade shrugged. \u201cYou been keepin\u2019 in touch with anyone else from that side of the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She said, \u201cI take that back. I stayed overnight with Colby and Channing a couple days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd everything seemed fine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides Channing bein\u2019 pregnant and housebound with a rambunctious fifteen month old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Colby around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot during the day. When he came home late, he was worried about leaving Channing alone because she\u2019s doin\u2019 too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Colby say where he\u2019d been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEquipment auction with Cord and Colt and Uncle Carson. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the damndest thing. Normally I keep in touch with Cord and Colt regularly, but in the last few days? Nothin\u2019. It\u2019s like they\u2019re all on vacation together. Carter and Macie are in Eagle River and she\u2019s due to pop any day so I doubt Carter knows what\u2019s goin\u2019 on back here. Dad even tried goin\u2019 over to see Carson when Ma freaked out because Aunt Carolyn wasn\u2019t returnin\u2019 any of her calls.\u201d</p><p>Chassie frowned. \u201cAny? Aunt Kimi and Aunt Carolyn are on the phone like twice a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, that\u2019s why Ma was concerned \u2019cause it\u2019d been three days since they\u2019d spoken. Uncle C met Dad at the door and wouldn\u2019t let him in the house, tellin\u2019 him Aunt C was feelin\u2019 poorly and might be contagious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d explain it, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Kade paused when Eliza fussed and squirmed. He turned her around, tucking his forearm under her butt as she snuggled her face against his chest. Eliza\u2019s big blue eyes were losing focus as Kade rubbed her back. It surprised Trevor how fast the baby girl ran out of steam.</p><p>As he waited for Kade to answer, Trevor wondered if he\u2019d be a good father. A natural like Colby and Kade. God knew his kids would suffer if he reverted to Tater and Starla Glanzer\u2019s lousy childrearing skills.</p><p>Wrong. He\u2019d never pit his kids against each other. Never belittle them in public or private. Never give them impossible standards to live up to. Never make his children feel they needed to earn his love. He\u2019d give his love freely. Frequently. Just like he\u2019d learned with Chassie.</p><p>Like you\u2019re beginning to do with Edgard?</p><p>Before his thoughts wandered down that slippery slope, Kade started talking again, more softly this time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think if Aunt C were so contagious then Colby, Cord, and Colt\u2019s trucks wouldn\u2019t have been parked out front, would you?\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s eyes narrowed on Kade. \u201cWhat day was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive, six days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could\u2019ve been one of the days I was at Colby\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if Aunt C is contagious, then no way would Colby take a chance on draggin\u2019 a flu bug or whatever back to his pregnant wife,\u201d Kade pointed out.</p><p>\u201cDammit. He lied to me. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. If Aunt C is sick, with something like cancer, wouldn\u2019t she want family around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKade, much as I love my McKay cousins, we both know Carson and Carolyn deal with their immediate family stuff in private. They always have. They always will. It\u2019s one of the reasons my dad was so upset when both his sisters married into the McKays. They take care of their own to the exclusion of everyone else.\u201d</p><p>Kade sighed. \u201cI know. My ma claims she ain\u2019t like that, but really, ain\u2019t we all that way? Closin\u2019 ranks? Makin\u2019 sure we\u2019re protectin\u2019 what\u2019s important to us in our own house even if we\u2019ve gotta shut everybody else out of it?\u201d</p><p>Trevor, Chassie and Edgard exchanged a quick look. Could they keep everyone out of their business? Immediately Trevor quashed that hope. Nothing was ever that simple.</p><p>Was it?</p><p>\u201cWhat about your brother? Don\u2019t he and Colt still live together?\u201d Chassie demanded.</p><p>\u201cYeah. But accordin\u2019 to Buck, Colt bailed around that same time. Given Colt\u2019s past, we weren\u2019t too sure he hadn\u2019t gone off on a bender, as much as it pains me to think it, let alone say it. So me\u2019n Buck were mighty relieved to hear Colt was accounted for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think is goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have a clue. That\u2019s why I asked you. I\u2019d appreciate you givin\u2019 me a call if you hear anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes.\u201d</p><p>The food arrived. The waitress said, \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Kade said, \u201cWould you mind packagin\u2019 up a couple of them pierogi Sky likes so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d The waitress smiled at a sleepy Eliza. \u201cI\u2019ll put in a slice of chocolate cake and toss in one of those soft sugar cookies for sweet baby too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a pierogi?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cMeaty, potatoey goodness wrapped up in chewy crust. Domini here, makes the best pierogis this side of Budapest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Domini blushed prettily. \u201cMr. McKay. You flatter me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times have I told you to stop callin\u2019 me that?\u201d He gestured to the trio in the booth. \u201cHave you met my cousin and her husband? Domini, this is Chassie and Trevor Glanzer. They live on Chassie\u2019s family\u2019s homeplace out west of town. This is their friend Edgard...didn\u2019t catch your last name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMancuso.\u201d Edgard reached for Domini\u2019s hand. \u201cPleasure to meet you, Domini.</p> <p>Forgive me for being so blunt, but where are you from?\u201d</p><p>Domini blushed harder.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Why don\u2019t you wrap us up about half a dozen of the pierogis?\u201d Edgard winked at Chassie. \u201cBe all right if I cook tonight, sweetheart? I\u2019m looking forward to an easy, fast supper because we\u2019ve got some issues to deal with afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll come up with something warm, sticky and sweet for dessert,\u201d Chassie cooed.</p><p>Trevor choked on his hash browns. The cheeky bastard was flirting with his wife.</p> <p>And she was flirting back? In front of her cousin?</p><p>Domini blurted, \u201cI\u2019ll throw in a couple of sugar cookies for you too,\u201d and practically sprinted away.</p><p>\u201cYou rodeo guys are horn dogs. I swear to God Eliza ain\u2019t ever datin\u2019 a cowboy.\u201d</p><p>His hold tightened on the sleeping baby.</p><p>\u201cWhat goes around comes around, cuz.\u201d Chassie chomped a bite of toast and her eyes twinkled at the Brazilian. \u201cSo tell me about Domini, Kade. She new around here? I think Edgard\u2019s interested.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s fork froze halfway to his mouth and Trevor hid his smile behind his napkin.</p> <p>Lord, that woman was just plain ornery. But the joke was on her because Edgard had such...inventive ways to discipline ornery.</p><p>\u201cYou know Macie\u2019s friend Kat?\u201d Chassie nodded. \u201cKat brought Domini here from Denver last fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a helluva cook, always in the kitchen, which is too bad \u2019cause she\u2019s mighty easy on the eyes, ain\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Edgard didn\u2019t answer, even when Kade addressed the last part of the question to him.</p><p>Kade brushed his lips over Eliza\u2019s head. \u201cAnyway, Kat is in Eagle River while Macie is on maternity leave and Velma is wintering in Phoenix. Kat put Domini in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini doesn\u2019t act like she wants to be in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s shy. But I think that\u2019s more from her circumstances than her personality.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Bosnian refugee, immigrated four years ago and has only been speakin\u2019 English that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how is it you know so much about the beautiful, mysterious, shy Domini?\u201d</p><p>Trevor teased. \u201cDoes Skylar approve of you tastin\u2019 her pu...rogue-ees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fuckin\u2019 hilarious, Glanzer. I know her because she and Nadia, another Bosnian woman who works for Sky, are sharin\u2019 a house since Nadia\u2019s divorce. And my nosy sister-in-law has taken a special interest in Domini. Which means the potential for Domini turnin\u2019 into a mouthy, tattooed pain in the ass has skyrocketed.\u201d</p><p>Kade hadn\u2019t noticed India enter the restaurant, nor that she stood right behind him.</p><p>Chassie and Trevor kept a straight face when India said, \u201cYou\u2019re sliding, Kade. You didn\u2019t mention I\u2019ve corrupted sweet, innocent Domini into getting pierced in some interestingly intimate places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, India. Why the fuck are you always sneakin\u2019 up on me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can. And I\u2019m telling my sister you\u2019re still swearing in front of the baby.\u201d</p><p>India stepped forward and propped her hand on her hip. \u201cOr maybe I won\u2019t tattle because I\u2019d totally pay to see the look on Sky\u2019s face when Eliza\u2019s first word is cocksucker. And by pay, I mean see you pay. For years, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha, you wish. Eliza\u2019s already said her first word.\u201d He beamed at Chassie. \u201cIt was Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures,\u201d Chassie muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt was doo doo and you extrapolated from there, daddy-o,\u201d India inserted.</p><p>Trevor grinned. India was as funny and rude as he\u2019d heard. Lord, he\u2019d be afraid to be in a room with her and Keely McKay.</p><p>Kade stood and shifted sleeping Eliza, turning his shoulder when India tried to sneak in and steal the baby from him. \u201cHuh-uh, this girl is all mine today. We\u2019ll go before India ruins your meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat seein\u2019 you guys. Keep in touch.\u201d Kade managed to slip Eliza\u2019s hat on with one hand without waking her. \u201cIndy, would you go up to the register and grab the to-go package for Sky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pay for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He winked and strode out.</p><p>\u201cCheap bastard,\u201d she shot at his back.</p><p>\u201cAre they always like that?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. Don\u2019t let their sniping fool you. They\u2019re crazy about each other. Kade has always wanted an annoying little sister and India is more\u2019n happy to oblige.\u201d A wistful look crossed her face. \u201cI\u2019m jealous actually. Trev\u2019s fallin\u2019 out with his family means I\u2019ve lost my chance for any sisters-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t such a great loss,\u201d Trevor mumbled.</p><p>After they\u2019d finished and requested another coffee refill, Chassie grabbed the newspaper. \u201cGuess what? There\u2019s a rodeo in Gillette this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? There\u2019s a rodeo every weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this one has a guaranteed purse of ten grand. Plus, the entry fee is like next to nothin\u2019.\u201d Her gaze flicked between him and Edgard. \u201cYou guys bein\u2019 former ropin\u2019 pros could win it.\u201d</p><p>Edgard laughed.</p><p>\u201cSeriously. You guys could walk away with a pocketful of cash and we\u2019d be closer to the down payment we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d still be short and it\u2019d just piss me off.\u201d Goddamn, it rankled he couldn\u2019t get a handle on that situation. Time was running out, too.</p><p>\u201cThink about it.\u201d Chassie scooted out of the booth. \u201cI\u2019m hittin\u2019 the ladies room. I\u2019ll meetcha out front.\u201d</p><p>He and Edgard were lost in their own thoughts. Trevor studied the people in the diner going about their daily business. Running errands, waiting for calving season to start, worried about money, dealing with relationship issues. His gaze landed on a pair of older ranchers, heads bent together, deep in discussion. He wouldn\u2019t assume they were anything but good friends. So who was to say those old gents hadn\u2019t been fucking each other silly at every opportunity for the last forty years?</p><p>And who really cares?</p><p>It was arrogant to assume people would gawk at him and Edgard sitting together sipping coffee and judge them to be longtime lovers.</p><p>Besides, lots of guys maintained close friendships and shared a place to hang their hats. Buck, Colt and Kade McKay had bunked together for half a dozen years before Kade got married. Hell, Chassie\u2019s cousins Remy and Chet West even built a house together. No one thought it odd.</p><p>A doubtful voice reminded him those examples were family. If Edgard moved in with him and Chassie permanently it\u2019d be a topic of gossip all over the county.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t it? Especially if Edgard ignored the come-ons from local women who\u2019d believe he was unattached? Or would the backlash come down on Chassie?</p><p>\u201cTrev?\u201d Edgard prompted. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Trevor watched Edgard\u2019s scarred fingers smoothing the folds in his paper napkin. He tried not to imagine those same fingers smoothing the zipper marks on Trevor\u2019s cock, which was getting harder by the second.</p><p>\u201cChass has gone out of her way to push our buttons all morning, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Trevor glanced up and a warning pinged in his head. \u201cYeah, but I\u2019ll admit that look in your eye scares me a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s confident smile glinted as dark and dangerous as a shark\u2019s. \u201cPush back.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>Edgard waited until they\u2019d loaded up at the grocery store and the feed store before he broached the issue of Little Mis-behavin\u2019.</p><p>Chassie chattered between them in the truck, oblivious to the wicked looks Trevor and Edgard were exchanging behind her back. When she realized no one had spoken, she stopped talking. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Trevor removed his hand from Chassie\u2019s thigh and placed it on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember me warnin\u2019 you about teasin\u2019 us in public?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me telling you there\u2019d be consequences in private?\u201d Edgard added. \u201cTime for your first disciplinary lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No way. I thought you were kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, Edgard never jokes about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. If you ain\u2019t figured it out yet, he\u2019s dominant.\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s eyebrows drew together. \u201cYou mean he\u2019s a top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Trev and I switch off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m about to define dominant with a hands-on demonstration\u2014using your hands.\u201d Edgard cupped Chassie\u2019s chin and forced her to look at him. \u201cUndo Trevor\u2019s jeans, then undo mine. You\u2019re gonna give us both handjobs. At the same time.\u201d His thumb swept across her bottom lip when her mouth opened. \u201cThat ain\u2019t a request.\u201d</p><p>She attempted to turn her head toward Trevor, probably hoping he\u2019d dispute Edgard\u2019s command, but Trevor merely grabbed her left hand and placed it on his crotch.</p><p>\u201cBeen lookin\u2019 forward to this since breakfast, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys planned this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis and more.\u201d</p><p>She choked, \u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Edgard angled sideways and put his mouth on her ear. \u201cShow me whatcha can do. Make us fly apart at your touch. May seem like I\u2019m the one in charge, but you\u2019re the one with all the power.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A little breathy moan burst from her lungs.</p><p>Chassie unhooked buckles, unzipped and peeled their jeans open, making sure the zipper teeth weren\u2019t anywhere near the delicate skin. When she had a cock in each hand she stroked steadily, from base to head.</p><p>\u201cGet us wet with your mouth first.\u201d</p><p>Chassie buried her face in Trevor\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes, that\u2019s it,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>\u201cNow me.\u201d</p><p>Chassie swiveled and sucked Edgard\u2019s cock, letting her saliva coat the length.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cBoth of us.\u201d</p><p>Again those strong fingers palmed his dick. Her thumb brushed the wetness on the crown with every pass and she used the pearly drops seeping from the tip for additional lubrication.</p><p>The sounds of her hands moving, skin slapping on skin, echoed in the cab. Tendrils of hair stirred around Chassie\u2019s head as the heater vent blew directly on her face. Her eyes were closed, cheeks rosy, lips parted and thighs clamped together tight as she worked them over.</p><p>Edgard glanced over to see Trevor white knuckling the steering wheel. It was sexy as hell watching Chassie\u2019s hand jacking Trevor off in the same rhythm Edgard felt on his own cock. \u201cDid you teach her how to do this, Trev? Or is she just a goddamn natural?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaught her,\u201d Trevor panted. \u201cBut Chassie picked up some tricks on her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you\u2019re good at that, querida.\u201d</p><p>Chassie made an affirmative noise, never faltering in her stroking motion.</p><p>\u201cHow close are you?\u201d Edgard asked, starting to bump his hips, wanting, needing that explosive rush.</p><p>\u201cReal close. Goddamn close. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d Edgard lifted his hand to Chassie\u2019s mouth, tracing her lips. \u201cSuck my finger. Suck it like it\u2019s my cock.\u201d</p><p>Trevor did the same. \u201cThat\u2019s it, baby. Suck \u2019em both together. Gives me an idea.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t that be something, Ed? Having both our dicks in her mouth at the same time?\u201d</p><p>Edgard growled at the visual and how amazing that would feel.</p><p>The feel of Chassie\u2019s warm, moist mouth, her rough tongue and Trevor\u2019s thick finger rubbing alongside his inside that wet heat had Edgard\u2019s balls drawing up.</p><p>He and Trevor said, \u201cFaster,\u201d at the same time. Her pace increased. Trevor groaned.</p> <p>That sweet familiar sound of Trevor\u2019s release and Edgard started coming, fucking Chassie\u2019s tight fist, watching as his come coated her fingers. His free hand gripped her thigh and he held his breath until he damn near passed out.</p><p>The truck swerved and he looked over at Trevor. \u201cJesus. Please tell me that you didn\u2019t close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>A sheepish grin appeared. \u201cJust for a second.\u201d</p><p>Chassie gave both their dicks one last squeeze to twin groans. \u201cPerfect timing. We\u2019re almost home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we ain\u2019t close to done.\u201d</p><p>After they put away the groceries, Trevor snagged Chassie by the hips and pulled her into his embrace for a long, steamy kiss.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d she asked when they finally broke apart.</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you. I love you like crazy.\u201d</p><p>She nuzzled his neck, breathing his scent into her lungs.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re game to try something...new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t we tried just about everything? Twice?\u201d</p><p>Trevor leaned back and looked at her. \u201cNot everything.\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s heart skipped a beat at his challenging expression. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Edgard pressed his front to her back, stringing hot openmouthed kisses down her neck, making her shiver. \u201cLike spanking.\u201d</p><p>Her heart threatened to beat right out of her chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a great ass,\u201d Trevor said, scraping his teeth up the other side of her throat. \u201cI wanna see it nice and pink while Edgard fucks it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um. Well. I-I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t really hurt you,\u201d Edgard murmured behind her. \u201cWe just wanna play with you a little rough.\u201d</p><p>She peeked over her shoulder at Edgard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been bad today. Sassing us with that mouth will just cause us to find more inventive uses for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d Trevor asked, \u201cYou find what you were lookin\u2019 for, Ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>The exquisite attention to both sides of her neck sent delicious vibrations straight to her pussy. \u201cI take it you\u2019ve done this sort of thing before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Trevor chuckled, then sank his teeth into her earlobe. \u201cBeen awhile so I\u2019m anxious for you to get them britches off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Where we doing this, Trev?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here in the living room. Drop them drawers, baby.\u201d</p><p>She moved back and began to undress.</p><p>\u201cShirt comes off too,\u201d Edgard piped in. \u201cAnd watch us while you\u2019re getting ready for us.\u201d He stepped into the space she\u2019d vacated and kissed Trevor. Not with his usual ravenous appetite, but pure seduction. Edgard nibbled and licked Trevor\u2019s lips, never quite delving inside his mouth. Trevor\u2019s low growls didn\u2019t spur Edgard to give in. If anything it primed him to back off.</p><p>Chassie had no problem doffing her jeans, but her fingers fumbled with the buttons on her shirt as she watched Edgard tormenting her husband.</p><p>\u201cTouch me, dammit,\u201d Trevor said, arching closer, angling his head for a more complete kiss.</p><p>Edgard latched onto Trevor\u2019s ass and rolled their hips together. Side to side. Up and down. Tiny circles. Every time he retreated, Trevor\u2019s body sought more contact. Edgard teased with his mouth and his body, controlled every movement and countermovement, literally making Trevor sweat.</p><p>It was erotic as hell.</p><p>Then Edgard backed off and faced Chassie, giving her an appreciative once-over.</p><p>\u201cBrace your hands on the wall.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the small bit of fear and did as Edgard instructed, keeping her body at a right angle as her palms pressed against the paneled wall. She heard clothing being removed, the jingle of belt buckles and coins. The pop pop pop of snaps coming undone.</p><p>She\u2019d focused so completely on sound, she jumped when rough hands caressed the globes of her ass. Over and over. Whisper soft. Her stomach muscles quivered with anticipation and clenched when that first sharp blow finally landed. She gasped, \u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Chassie cranked her head and met her husband\u2019s glittering eyes as his hand swatted her ass cheeks again. This time it wasn\u2019t her stomach that clenched, but her pussy. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Edgard stepped into her peripheral view and tipped her chin up. \u201cNot another sound.</p><p>Take your licks like a good girl, understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. Eyes forward. Keep goin\u2019, Trev.\u201d</p><p>Her husband peppered her ass until every inch of it stung. Every inch of it burned with erotic fire. About halfway through it\u2019d stopped being punishment and became...pleasure. The heart-pounding wait for the connection of his hand. The stinging slap. The excruciating delay, then the delicious payout as the sound of flesh meeting flesh reverberated around her, up her spine, hardening her nipples as her skin burned.</p><p>Trevor said, \u201cI can smell those sweet, sweet pussy juices.\u201d His fingers slid down the crack of her ass, stopping when they encountered wetness. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely drippin\u2019 wet, Chass. You like this.\u201d He pumped two fingers inside her.</p><p>She arched and bumped her hips back for more. Oh God. She was so close.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Edgard demanded. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t get to come yet.\u201d</p><p>Chassie whimpered.</p><p>Four hard spanks, harder than before, landed low, down by her thighs. Then Edgard\u2019s voice, dark and dangerous, was in her ear. \u201cThought I told you no sounds.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m being cruel for not letting you come?\u201d</p><p>Chassie nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut, querida,\u201d he crooned in that impossibly sexy accent, \u201cthe build-up is the best part. When we\u2019re done you\u2019re gonna come so hard you\u2019ll be begging for us to spank you again.\u201d Edgard licked the shell of her ear. \u201cAnd again.\u201d</p><p>Everything\u2014her burning ass, her wet pussy, the tingles racing down her spine from Edgard\u2019s seductive whispers\u2014felt so good Chassie was on sensory overload. She\u2019d chomped her bottom lip with such force she tasted blood.</p><p>\u201cThree more. Each side. Down low,\u201d Edgard instructed. \u201cThen get what we need.\u201d</p><p>Trevor hummed his approval and she heard the wet sucking sounds of them kissing.</p><p>The blows came fast and hard. Her legs and arms shook. Fingers traced her crack again, delved inside her cunt again. Three fingers this time, pushing deep. In. Out. In.</p><p>Out. Almost there, please. Don\u2019t stop.</p><p>A slower withdrawal as her own juices were painted up to her tailbone.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Not Trevor\u2019s voice. Edgard\u2019s.</p><p>Again Chassie twisted to look over her shoulder.</p><p>Edgard lowered into a crouch, his tongue licked a line from her clit, through her swollen pussy lips, stopping to swirl around the entrance to her sex, then lapping at her hole and following the split between her butt cheeks up to her tailbone. He stood and smacked his lips.</p><p>Chassie couldn\u2019t help but groan as her head dropped helplessly between her arms.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop the scream when her burning backside was doused with ice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Now let us hear you, baby.\u201d</p><p>Hot. Cold. Wet. Hands on her. Fingers in her. Too much sensation. She started to collapse from the effort to keep herself upright.</p><p>Trevor scooped her up and perched her on the couch. \u201cSpread \u2019em wide.\u201d</p><p>Somehow her brain processed the command as the scratchy couch material abraded her bare back. Two mouths kissed up the inside of her thighs and met in the middle of her twitching sex. She screamed when those two tongues began their assault. One hot. One cold. Licking her clit, then stopping to tangle as Edgard and Trevor shared an intimate kiss at the intimate heart of her. She grabbed two handfuls of hair, canting her pelvis, whimpering, wanting, needing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A finger speared her ass; another speared her pussy. When Trevor sucked her clitoris, Chassie came unglued.</p><p>Every muscle in her body contracted and she sobbed through every pulsing, gyrating, wet, throbbing second of the most intensive orgasm of her life.</p><p>Soft, sweet kisses on her belly roused her and she shivered, opening her eyes.</p><p>Both men wore mighty pleased expressions, but the hunger in their eyes meant one thing: that was the appetizer.</p><p>Lord. She\u2019d never survive the main course.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>Trevor pursed his lips around Chassie\u2019s right nipple and suckled softly, releasing the strawberry-colored tip with a loud pop. Jesus, she was sexy. Willing. Giving.</p><p>Adventurous. Accepting of his and Edgard\u2019s harsher edges. Her skin was flushed so prettily, the inside of her thighs were soaked from excitement. His hair actually hurt, she\u2019d pulled it so hard during her climax. \u201cChass? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I think so.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWe\u2019re switchin\u2019 places, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause we ain\u2019t done. On your hands and knees on the floor facin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta warn you, my brain ain\u2019t firing on all cylinders yet.\u201d</p><p>Edgard tweaked her left nipple, then suckled the sting. \u201cWe want you so bad we\u2019ll take you with the dazed look. You blow my mind.\u201d He kissed circles around her breast, nuzzling her in the sweet, comforting way she preferred. \u201cYou are hotter than the sun, and if I don\u2019t have you right now, I might actually burn up.\u201d She snorted her disbelief and he helped her to the floor, still muttering nonsensical phrases.</p><p>Trevor slid into position on the couch, his cock at the level of Chassie\u2019s mouth as Edgard spun her into place.</p><p>Then Edgard stood and rolled on a condom. Keeping his eyes on Trevor\u2019s, he greased up his cock and grabbed the mini-vibrator.</p><p>Just like that, every bit of urgency returned.</p><p>He looked at his wife and stroked her face. \u201cI wanna be like that sweet-talkin\u2019 Brazilian and spend hours tellin\u2019 you how fantastic you are, but Jesus, I wanna be buried balls deep in this mouth. I wanna see Ed\u2019s cock reamin\u2019 your ass. I wanna do it now, no waitin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Chassie whispered, \u201cI want that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWiden your stance and hold still,\u201d Edgard said.</p><p>As soon as she\u2019d moved, Edgard turned on the compact vibrator and pushed it in her cunt. She gasped, fully opening her mouth, and Trevor shoved his cock in to the root.</p><p>\u201cBreathe. \u2019Cause once we get goin\u2019, darlin\u2019, this is gonna be a wild ride.\u201d</p> <p>Edgard squirted lube on two fingers. Trevor began to rock in and out of Chassie\u2019s mouth, curling his hands around her ears, letting her know he was in control.</p><p>She sucked greedily, moaning as Edgard\u2019s fingers breached her ass.</p><p>\u201cChassie, you\u2019re so damn hot and tight around my fingers, I wanna feel that same heat surrounding my cock.\u201d Edgard aligned his cock to the pinkish pucker, pulling Chassie\u2019s cheeks apart and canting her hips.</p><p>\u201cGo slow at first,\u201d Trevor gritted out. \u201cI wanna see every fuckin\u2019 inch of your cock disappearin\u2019 into her ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen look now \u2019cause I ain\u2019t waiting.\u201d The fat purple head popped in past the ring of muscle.</p><p>Chassie tensed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t clench. There\u2019s a good girl.\u201d</p><p>Trevor watched that length of uncut meat pushing deeper until Edgard\u2019s hips were snugged against Chassie\u2019s ass. \u201cWish we had a mirror, so you could see how sexy you look book-ended between us with your ass nice and pink.\u201d As Trevor said it, Edgard smoothed a hand over from the curve of Chassie\u2019s hip to her thigh and back up, teasing her hot skin with just the tips of his cool fingers.</p><p>She shuddered and used her teeth down his shaft and tongued the tip before releasing it. \u201cPlease, I\u2019m on the verge of another\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby, we\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>They pulled back simultaneously, thrust simultaneously.</p><p>Trevor concentrated on the perfect wet seal Chassie had created with her mouth as he fucked it hard and fast. Almost there. Almost...</p><p>Edgard\u2019s pelvis pistoned a half-dozen times and he stopped, throwing back his head as he came.</p><p>Chassie bucked and groaned, the vibrating sound just the push Trevor needed to send him over the edge.</p><p>Light, sound, air, nothing existed but the series of hot pulses and rhythmic sucking.</p><p>When his spent cock popped from her mouth, he opened his eyes. Edgard had already pulled out and was kissing up Chassie\u2019s spine, murmuring in Portuguese as he removed the vibrator. He stood and went to take care of the condom.</p><p>Trevor lifted his wife into his arms. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeelin\u2019 all used up\u2014in a good way.\u201d Chassie yawned. \u201cI\u2019m toast. You guys wore me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna go upstairs and lay down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Wanna be with you and Ed down here, \u2019cause I know neither of you are tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, baby, you can\u2019t keep your eyes open.\u201d</p><p>Edgard returned. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s exhausted. Help me pull out the foldout bed.\u201d Trevor set Chassie in the recliner and he and Edgard made up the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take her to your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants to stay down here for some reason.\u201d Trevor swept her up amidst her sleepy protests and deposited her between the sheets.</p><p>\u201cThis bed is bigger than ours. Plus, I like it when we\u2019re all snuggled close together in a big messy pile of naked bodies.\u201d Chassie purred, curling up next to Edgard after he slid in beside her. \u201cYou\u2019re so warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure are a cuddly little kitten, Miz Chassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother you I\u2019m a friendly sleeper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I like it.\u201d Edgard playfully tugged on her braid. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard me complaining the last couple nights, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, and I\u2019m glad, \u2019cause macho Trevor doesn\u2019t wanna snuggle up nearly as much as I like to. He needs his space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware of that,\u201d Edgard said dryly.</p><p>Trevor rolled his eyes. \u201cYou two done insultin\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>Chassie said, \u201cIt\u2019s not an insult if it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Edgard laughed.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, woman. And you\u201d\u2014he pointed at Edgard\u2014\u201cquit encouragin\u2019 her.\u201d</p><p>Trevor grabbed the remote and tossed a couple of pillows on the bed, adding another blanket before he crawled in on Chassie\u2019s other side. He turned on the TV.</p><p>\u201cComfy?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Glad we did chores early \u2019cause I sure as hell don\u2019t feel like gettin\u2019 dressed and goin\u2019 back outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither. I forgot how damn breath-stealing the cold can be up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it. Next winter you won\u2019t even notice.\u201d</p><p>Edgard turned and looked at him. \u201cYou askin\u2019 me if I\u2019ll be around next year?\u201d</p><p>That assumption just slipped out and Trevor had no way to backtrack.</p><p>You don\u2019t want to take it back. You want him here. Man up and tell him the truth.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all I ever wanted.\u201d</p><p>The warmth filling Trevor\u2019s body owed nothing to the blankets.</p><p>Chassie was already asleep, one hand resting on Edgard\u2019s bare chest; the other on Trevor\u2019s abdomen. Trevor and Edgard were propped up against the back of the couch.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s whupped.\u201d Trevor brushed a hank of hair from her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWe were pretty demanding.\u201d</p><p>Trevor grinned. \u201cAnd she loved every minute of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. So did I. You tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. You?\u201d</p><p>Edgard shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m wired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna see what\u2019s on ESPN2?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Haven\u2019t seen a good football game in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFootball season is over. The Superbowl was last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou Americans. Everyone else in the world calls it football and yet you insist on calling it soccer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t matter \u2019cause I ain\u2019t watchin\u2019 soccer,\u201d Trevor scoffed. He flipped channels until he landed on one that interested him. \u201cSee? Now this is a real sport.\u201d</p><p>Edgard snorted. \u201cI ain\u2019t watchin\u2019 a mixed martial arts marathon. Guys beating the shit out of each other? Just like Saturday night in a damn cowboy bar except they ain\u2019t yelling insults about the other guys\u2019 mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this guy fightin\u2019 is a master of Brazilian jujitsu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care. Just \u2019cause Brazil is in the name of something don\u2019t mean shit. And for the record, I don\u2019t like Brazil nuts either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like \u2019em just fine,\u201d Trevor said slyly.</p><p>\u201cSmartass. Why is it you never let me have the goddamn remote?\u201d Edgard snapped,</p><p>\u201cGive it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Trevor passed it over and threaded his fingers through Edgard\u2019s, setting their joined hands on the pillow above Chassie\u2019s head. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Trevor knew it didn\u2019t have a damn thing to do with Edgard finally getting control of the remote.</p><p>A few hours later, they were still lounging in bed, eating popcorn and watching Cops reruns, when Chassie said, \u201cWhy are so many people on this show always naked? No one wanders around naked in real life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoken by a woman who is totally buck-ass nekkid between not one, but two buck-ass nekkid men,\u201d Trevor pointed out.</p><p>The phone rang, cutting off her response.</p><p>Trevor snagged the receiver off the coffee table and answered, \u201cHello?\u201d He frowned.</p><p>\u201cMa? Why\u2019re you...No.\u201d Pause. \u201cWhat?\u201d He sprang up. \u201cWhen?\u201d Pause. \u201cAnd you\u2019re just callin\u2019 me now?\u201d Pause. \u201cThat\u2019s a lousy fuckin\u2019 excuse and you know it.\u201d Trevor inhaled and exhaled slowly, trying to stay calm. \u201cSorry. No. That\u2019s fine.\u201d Longer pause as he paced. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what the hell he wants but, yeah, I\u2019ll leave first thing in the mornin\u2019. Yeah. Noon, probably. See ya then.\u201d He clicked the off button. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrevor? Honey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Trevor looked at Chassie. \u201cMy father had a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no. When?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA fuckin\u2019 week ago.\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAnd they\u2019re just calling you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently. Jesus. I can\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s out of the hospital and recovering at home.\u201d</p><p>Edgard said, \u201cHow serious is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerious enough that the old man\u2019s requested my presence right away.\u201d A bitter laugh escaped. \u201cOr what he considers right away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat does he want to see you about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue. I hafta go tomorrow. Don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be gone.\u201d He looked from Chassie to Edgard. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here to help her. Be just our luck if calves started droppin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...don\u2019t you want me to come with you?\u201d Chassie asked.</p><p>Trevor sat next to her and took her hand. \u201cWithout soundin\u2019 like a dick, you don\u2019t wanna meet my family under these circumstances. Hell, I really don\u2019t want you to meet them under any circumstances.\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cChass, baby, they\u2019re not nice people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can that be? You\u2019re nice.\u201d</p><p>He grunted.</p> <p>\u201cYou are.\u201d Her warm fingers brushed his face. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have to deal with them alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I just...dammit, I don\u2019t wanna have to deal with them at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Come back to bed and let me and Ed love you up tonight. We\u2019ll give you a happy memory to take with you.\u201d</p><p>Trevor crawled between them, unprepared for the blitz on his emotions and his body.</p><p>Edgard and Chassie worked in tandem. Kissing him until he couldn\u2019t discern Edgard\u2019s taste from Chassie\u2019s. Touching him, driving him to the breaking point with dual sensations of rough and soft hands caressing his slick skin. Two mouths sucking and licking. One big hand firmly jacking his cock while tiny fingers delicately rolled his balls.</p><p>Chassie and Edgard switched things up as if they\u2019d choreographed this erotic dance a hundred times. She tongued his nipples while Edgard fucked his mouth. Ed came quickly in a molten rush down Trevor\u2019s throat. Even as he was still swallowing, Edgard scooted Trevor\u2019s ass off the end of the bed. Chassie straddled his head, grinding her sweet, wet pussy against his face as she slipped into sixty-nine position. Edgard was on his knees on the floor, scraping his fingers up and down Trevor\u2019s trembling legs and toyed with his balls and prepped his hole as Chassie\u2019s tongue continued to keep him on the ragged edge.</p><p>Trevor arched when Edgard impaled him. Fast and hard disappeared as he fucked Trevor thoroughly, but with absolute leisure. Chassie bumped her hips and her clit throbbed beneath his flickering tongue; she lifted her mouth off his dick and gasped as he sucked every last pulse from that swollen pearl.</p><p>After she\u2019d caught her sanity, Edgard said, \u201cUse your hand on him so I can fuck him harder and not worry about your teeth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want him to see what we\u2019re doin\u2019?\u201d she asked as she lay alongside Trevor\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we both know how much he likes to watch.\u201d Edgard\u2019s thrusts were hard and deep and hit Trevor\u2019s gland on every stroke. Trevor pumped into Chassie\u2019s tight fist, feeling the pace Edgard set in his head, his heart, his cock and his ass. For one breathtaking second he dangled on the precipice of bliss, then he soared over. He watched as milky white spurts arced out of his cockhead onto Chassie\u2019s chest and his anal muscles flexed around Edgard\u2019s prick, immediately sending Edgard into a shuddering climax.</p><p>\u201cHoly hell,\u201d Trevor panted. His gaze focused on Edgard and Chassie, who hadn\u2019t moved at all. Who weren\u2019t paying attention to him at all.</p><p>With a sound resembling a growl, Edgard brought Chassie close to him, bent his head and licked the opaque droplets from Chassie\u2019s chest with long sweeps of his tongue.</p><p>Chassie\u2019s head fell back and she moaned seductively as Edgard cleaned up every rivulet, save for a thick spot on the tip of Chassie\u2019s nipple. That one he wiped off with the pad of his thumb, bringing it to her mouth so she could suck it clean.</p><p>The pure joy displayed between these two people he loved had tears springing to his eyes. He finally had exactly what he wanted and he couldn\u2019t bear to let either one go, not for a single night, let alone a lifetime.</p><p>But didn\u2019t he owe his family a second chance? Part of him screamed no; part of him looked over at Edgard and was thankful for second chances.</p><p>No surprise his sleep was troubled as he wrestled with the unknown.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>The second Trevor pulled up to the place he used to call home, he damn near slammed his old truck in reverse and peeled rubber in an effort to escape.</p><p>Nothing had changed outside the house; he suspected nothing had changed inside either.</p><p>Trevor parked and took off his University of Wyoming ball cap, running his hands through his hair, unconsciously mimicking Edgard\u2019s nervous gesture. He stared at the barns\u2014seven in all\u2014and the gigantic corral surrounded by brand new white metal fencing. Four horse trailers were lined in symmetrical rows along the far left side of the chutes.</p><p>Two tractors were parked next to the towering stacks of hay. Must\u2019ve been a good year if that much remained this late in the season. Then again, his dad could\u2019ve bought the damn piles of hay. Money had never been an issue for Tater Glanzer. It was both a carrot and a stick\u2014not just for members of his family.</p><p>He knocked back a long drink from the bottle of water, wishing it were whiskey.</p><p>After placing the plastic bottle back in the cup holder, Trevor jammed his hands through his hair again.</p><p>You\u2019re stalling.</p><p>No shit. And how fucking stupid was it that he was cowering in his truck, scared of a sixty-year-old man? He grabbed his duffel bag and ambled up the sidewalk.</p><p>Before Trevor decided whether to knock or to walk in, the door opened. His younger brother Brent sneered at him. \u201cDon\u2019t be hopin\u2019 Pa\u2019s heart attack has softened him up.</p><p>He\u2019s still a mean SOB and you\u2019re still on his shit list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to see you too, Brent.\u201d Trevor sidestepped him and paused in the entryway beside the ostentatious curved staircase that would\u2019ve had a southern plantation owner weeping with envy.</p><p>\u201cHello, Trevor.\u201d</p><p>He focused on his mother sprawled on the long chaise, a cigarette dangling between her lips. The explosion of flowers on the couch clashed with the floral robe she wore. At noon. On a weekday.</p><p>Nothing new there either.</p><p>Starla Glanzer still played the part of a rodeo queen, despite the passing of three and a half decades. Her hair was dyed a shiny blonde and teased into an unnatural cloud around her pudgy face. Her eyes were bloodshot from the booze she sucked down like milk, not from bawling over her husband\u2019s current health crisis, Trevor thought cynically.</p><p>No loving embrace from his mother. Starla loved one thing: money. Her five children ranked below expensive things and her husband ranked even lower.</p><p>She exhaled a blue cloud. Her botoxed face remained a mask of boredom as if it\u2019d been two hours since she\u2019d seen her oldest son, not two years. \u201cSo you did show up. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2019d you call me and ask me to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTater told me to. Wouldn\u2019t want it to get out that I denied a dyin\u2019 man his last wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ain\u2019t close to dead, Ma,\u201d Brent said. \u201cMight as well go back to whatever hole you crawled out of, Trevor. It was a wasted trip.\u201d</p><p>Trevor grinned carelessly, rather than fighting back, knowing it pissed his brother off. \u201cI\u2019m here. Might as well pay my respects to the old man.\u201d</p><p>His mother snorted and choked on a lungful of smoke.</p><p>\u201cMa? You okay?\u201d A very pregnant woman waddled in from the kitchen. She stopped suddenly and her eyes darted from Trevor to Brent to Starla. \u201cWhat is he doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLianna,\u201d Trevor drawled, \u201cyou\u2019re lookin\u2019 as lovely as ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the shit, Trevor. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think he wants?\u201d Brent snapped.</p><p>Lianna whirled on Brent, the brother who stood between them in distance and age.</p><p>\u201cWhen I want your opinion, I\u2019ll ask Ma or your wife for it.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. Less than five fucking minutes and he was in the midst of the same old pointless bickering and bullshit. Trevor addressed his mother. \u201cWhich room am I stayin\u2019 in? I wanna dump my stuff before I see Pa.\u201d</p><p>Brent and Lianna said simultaneously, \u201cHe\u2019s stayin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he is.\u201d His mother flashed a smile at him, ignoring his siblings. \u201cTrevor is family. Where else would he stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the bunkhouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did I hear you say you wanted him to stay at your house, Lianna, darlin\u2019?\u201d Starla cooed in a saccharine tone. \u201cBecause I could arrange that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so. Besides, we\u2019re havin\u2019 a family dinner tonight. You three, Molly, and Tanner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTanner is here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe quit the competition the minute he heard about your father being in the hospital.</p><p>He drove straight through the night to be at his father\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>Her meaning\u2014Tanner did his duty and you didn\u2019t\u2014was crystal clear. It\u2019d be futile to point out that no one had told him until a week after the incident happened.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Tanner now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleepin\u2019 off a drunk in the new horse trailer with some skanky bar maid,\u201d Lianna said.</p><p>Starla glared at Lianna. \u201cAnyway, everyone will be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone except your wife, Trevor. Why didn\u2019t she come with you?\u201d</p><p>Because I\u2019m keeping that sweet woman away from this nest of vipers as long as possible. He forced a curt, \u201cShe\u2019s busy. She sends her regrets.\u201d Trevor\u2019s hand tensed on the duffel bag strap and he glanced at his mother, perched like a Marlboro rodeo queen among her admiring peasants. \u201cWhich room?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSame as last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get settled in. Is Pa up in his bedroom?\u201d His parents hadn\u2019t shared a bed for years\u2014a fact they were both mighty proud of\u2014a fact he couldn\u2019t fathom since he shared his bed with both Chassie and Edgard in recent days.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t climb stairs yet so he\u2019s set up in the den,\u201d Lianna said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s sleepin\u2019 right now. I ain\u2019t about to let you just bull your way in there and wake him up. The man had a heart attack. He needs his rest.\u201d</p> <p>Just then a cowbell clanked from the vicinity of the den.</p><p>Everyone froze.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t anyone hear this goddamn bell?\u201d the old man yelled and proceeded to ring the cowbell as if the den had morphed into his own personal bell tower.</p><p>\u201cJesus. I hate that cowbell and it\u2019s your fault for givin\u2019 it to him, Lianna,\u201d his mother snapped and stalked toward the mad ringing.</p><p>Trevor didn\u2019t jab Lianna for her lie. Instead, he started up the stairs.</p> <p>In the bedroom at the end of the hall, he tossed his bag on the floor next to the old wooden rocking horse his grandfather had hand carved. Stuck in the trophy room again.</p><p>A shrine to his father, the great Tater Glanzer, and the man\u2019s impact on the sport of rodeo.</p><p>Saddles, spurs, belt buckles, trophies, framed newspaper articles, framed magazine covers, more trophies. Trevor knew his mother picked this room in an effort to make Trevor feel inferior in the face of all his father\u2019s accomplishments. It didn\u2019t work. Not anymore. All it did was remind him how much of his life he\u2019d wasted trying to live up to expectations that weren\u2019t his own.</p><p>If only he\u2019d been working, not rodeoing, not chasing someone else\u2019s dream, then he\u2019d have the money he and Chassie needed to buy Gus\u2019s land.</p><p>\u201cStop beating yourself up.\u201d Chassie\u2019s gentle voice drifted into Trevor\u2019s mind like a refreshing breeze, washing away his frustration, if only temporarily. She had that calming effect.</p><p>So did Edgard.</p> <p>He wondered how the two of them were faring without him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about goat births?\u201d</p><p>Edgard had joined Chassie and they were draped across the top of Greta\u2019s stall in the barn.</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cCan\u2019t be much different than foals or calves, can it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reckon they\u2019re the same. That\u2019s why I think Greta is in labor.\u201d Chassie squinted at the nanny goat chomping on a pile of hay.</p><p>\u201cHate to break it to you, but Greta looks too bored to be in labor. She hasn\u2019t lost her appetite a bit, which is a damn shame \u2019cause she\u2019s gonna eat us out of house and home.</p><p>No wonder he was so anxious to get rid of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all females of the species bleat and moan and flop on the ground when their time comes, Ed. Some give birth with quiet dignity.\u201d</p> <p>Edgard\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cMy mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why I think Greta\u2019s behavior is mighty suspect. She hasn\u2019t shown her hiney in the last half hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Edgard muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably swollen.\u201d Chassie gave Edgard an arch look. \u201cI know how that goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sympathy from me. Maybe next time you\u2019ll heed our warnings and save your poor hiney.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t remember signing on for gettin\u2019 my ass smacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComes with the territory\u2014and two territorial males.\u201d Edgard offered her a sunny smile. \u201cNo extra charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe next time I\u2019ll spank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I\u2019d consider it if you\u2019ll kiss it and make it better afterward.\u201d</p><p>Her face burned when she remembered how erotic it\u2019d been having two mouths and two sets of rough male hands caressing her flaming skin. She hopped down from the fence. \u201cI\u2019m gonna check her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s not such a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you mean I\u2019m concerned about your well-being, querida, then I\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can handle one little goat.\u201d</p><p>Greta lifted her head and baaed a greeting when Chassie entered the stall. Then she returned to mowing hay, allowing Chassie an opportunity to run her hand down the side of Greta\u2019s rotund belly. Didn\u2019t feel like it was pulling and heaving with labor pains.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell. Need a better look back here.\u201d Chassie kept stroking Greta\u2019s rear right flank as she dropped to her knees.</p><p>\u201cChass, that\u2019s not such a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop bein\u2019 such a worry wart. Look how full her udders are.\u201d Greta stilled when Chassie\u2019s fingers brushed the closest teat. \u201cYou\u2019re ready to be a mama, aren\u2019t you, pretty girl?\u201d</p><p>Greta baaed loudly.</p><p>\u201cLemme see how close we are. Okay?\u201d Chassie inched sideways. The second she placed her hand on Greta\u2019s rump, Greta panicked.</p><p>Her back end flew up, her legs flying high, and her hoof connected with Chassie\u2019s forehead.</p><p>Chassie literally saw stars as she hit the dirt.</p><p>A thud sounded as Edgard jumped the fence, sending hay dust swirling around Chassie\u2019s head. \u201cChassie?\u201d</p><p>She forced her eyes open and Edgard\u2019s face swam into view.</p><p>\u201cOh damn, baby, your forehead is really bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Her vision was blurry and she had a vicious headache.</p><p>\u201cJesus. Hold still.\u201d He stripped off his glove with his teeth and pressed it to where her pulse pounded up by her hairline.</p><p>\u201cJesus fucking Christ would you stop, that hurts!\u201d So much for acting tough.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but you hafta keep pressure on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. Hang on.\u201d Edgard slipped one arm under her knees and the other under her neck as he lifted her.</p><p>\u201cI can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d Edgard kicked the stall door shut and carried her into the house. When Chassie tried to sit up on the couch, he pushed her back down. \u201cDon\u2019t move and let me look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably just a scratch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me be the judge of that, okay?\u201d He sucked in a harsh breath when he gently pulled the glove away. \u201cI think it needs stitches. She sliced you open good.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Chassie started to cry. \u201cI don\u2019t want stitches. I\u2019ll have horrible scars and I\u2019m already not rodeo queen material and I\u2019ll end up lookin\u2019 worse than I do right now, probably like Frankenstein.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChassie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we can\u2019t afford a trip to the doctor\u2019s office,\u201d she practically wailed. \u201cMaybe you should just take me to the veterinarian\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh.\u201d Edgard wiped her tears and dabbed at the blood. \u201cCalm down. I\u2019m taking you to a real doctor. We\u2019ll get you fixed up. And there\u2019s no way you could ever look like Frankenstein.\u201d</p><p>Pain throbbed in her head. \u201cI hate doctors. Hospitals. All that medical shit.\u201d</p><p>After a minute or so of silence, he asked, \u201cBecause of your mother?\u201d</p><p>Images of claustrophobic rooms and the stench of antiseptics caused her stomach to pitch. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never talk about her. You said she was sick. You sort of seemed embarrassed about it.\u201d</p><p>Chassie nodded. \u201cShe was sick for a long time before she died. Most my life, actually. Because she was Native we ended up at the Indian Health Services hospital. No one cared whether she got better, except me. It was like we were both invisible and unwanted. I hated roaming the hospital corridors wondering if I\u2019d return to her room and find her...gone. The worst part was I figured no one would notice when she passed on, and that\u2019s exactly what happened the day she finally died. She was dead for an hour before I could get anyone to come into her room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>More tears leaked out even when Edgard\u2019s touch soothed her. \u201cYou\u2019re really gonna make me do this, aren\u2019t you? Go to the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart, I am. But I\u2019ll hold your hand the entire time. I won\u2019t leave your side. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. You\u2019re so sweet, you probably think I\u2019m such a crybaby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. I don\u2019t think any such thing. It\u2019s okay to lean on me.\u201d He smoothed the hair from her cheek. \u201cI want you to be able to count on me, Chassie, for whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d In a rush, Chassie said, \u201cBut you can\u2019t tell Trevor what happened when he calls.\u201d</p><p>Frown lines appeared on Edgard\u2019s forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. He\u2019ll freak out and there\u2019s nothin\u2019 he can do. He needs to stay and sort things out with his family. We both know he\u2019ll come racing home if we give him a reason to.\u201d</p><p>Edgard studied her. He bent down to kiss her cheek. \u201cI disagree, but we\u2019ve got more important things to do than argue. Stay put. I\u2019ll pull the truck up and then we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>Trevor killed an hour in his room, alternating between staring out the window and scowling at the rodeo trophies. When he deemed his temper able to handle not only his father, but the rest of his family, he ventured downstairs.</p><p>They\u2019d moved out of the doublewide trailer in Crook County and into this testament to Tater Glanzer\u2019s ego the year Trevor turned thirteen. Hadn\u2019t mattered to his father, uprooting his oldest son at the start of Trevor\u2019s high school rodeo career, with one of the most respected high school rodeo teams in the state. Hadn\u2019t mattered to his father that Trevor left behind his best friend and the family he\u2019d wished he\u2019d been born into.</p><p>Between Tater\u2019s rodeo earnings, the untimely death of Starla\u2019s father\u2014who\u2019d left every penny of his Wyoming oil money to his only daughter\u2014they set to building the most flamboyant, gaudy house this side of the Big Horn mountains. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tater demanded their new home be decorated country cabin style, with exotic and domestic animal heads from his various hunting expeditions mounted on the walls and the space littered with his collection of mostly tacky Western art.</p><p>Starla ignored Tater\u2019s demands and decorated the house in the style of an English country manor, with chintz-covered chairs, plaid and floral couches, lace doilies, ruffles and bows.</p><p>The result was pretty hideous, an interior decorator\u2019s worst nightmare\u2014Laura Ashley meets Conan the Barbarian. The horse scenes painted on velvet clashed with the velvet draperies. The rusted barbed wire folk art sculptures did not complement the classic Greek marble figurines. The grizzly bear skin rug clashed with the Oriental carpets. Trevor and Chassie were on the same page for how they wanted their home to look. Hard to be picky when money was an issue. After they\u2019d first gotten married, she\u2019d jokingly suggested they decorate in the theme of cowboy versus Indian to keep with their heritages.</p> <p>What Brazilian pieces would Edgard add to their eclectic mix? Had he even brought any of his personal stuff over from Brazil?</p><p>While he was lost in thought, pondering the changes he wanted to make in his life even as he wondered if he had the guts to follow through with it, his mother had somehow snuck up behind him. \u201cYou always were a damn daydreamer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly way to escape from the shitty reality in this family. Besides, I always got my chores done on time. Can\u2019t say the same for anyone else.\u201d Trevor turned around. \u201cI\u2019m ready to see Pa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? He ain\u2019t his old piss and vinegar self.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d An emotion close to worry briefly appeared in Starla\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow serious is this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSerious enough for him to call you home.\u201d She sniffed with disdain. \u201cI\u2019ll let you judge for yourself.\u201d Cigarette in hand, she pushed open the door to the den without knocking. \u201cGet up, you old bastard, Trevor is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ma.\u201d Trevor brushed past her. The room was dark except for a lamp in the corner and the glow of the big screen TV mounted on the far wall.</p><p>Tater Glanzer was in bed. Trevor didn\u2019t remember ever seeing his dad in bed past eight in the morning. Tater wore plaid pajamas, his face was pale and his yellowed hair stuck up like sections of straw.</p><p>At one time everyone commented on the resemblance between Trevor and Tater. As years passed and his father packed on weight, the likeness was less pronounced. But for Trevor, the only differences that mattered were those on the inside.</p><p>\u201cTrevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPa.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome in, boy. Starla, shut the goddamn door behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I leave I ain\u2019t comin\u2019 back in here to wait on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter thirty-six years you think that\u2019s a big surprise to me? Send Lianna in here after a bit. Make sure she knocks first.\u201d</p><p>The door shut hard enough to rattle the DVDs on the end table. His parents\u2019 sniping and the door slamming barely registered. Trevor pulled up a folding chair, spun it around and straddled it, propping his arms across the back. \u201cSo I\u2019m here. What do you want?</p><p>Now that I can plainly see you ain\u2019t gonna die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t got much sympathy for me, do ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes. I\u2019m your father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s something you said embarrassed you on a daily basis, so try again.\u201d</p><p>Tater looked away. \u201cWe\u2019ve all said and done things we ain\u2019t proud of, son.\u201d</p><p>That admission was the closest he\u2019d ever get to an apology, but it didn\u2019t soften Trevor toward the ornery SOB one iota.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of...why didn\u2019t your wife come with you? Ain\u2019t none of us met her yet.</p><p>Makes me wonder if you\u2019re ashamed of her.\u201d</p><p>Rage erupted inside him, precisely the reaction his father goaded him into, so Trevor refused to grant it to him. \u201cLeave Chassie out of this. You spewed a buncha racist bullshit about her once and you ain\u2019t ever doin\u2019 it again. So if you can\u2019t be civil when you speak of my wife, I\u2019ll walk out the fuckin\u2019 door right now, old man, understand?\u201d</p><p>The outburst appeared to have pleased Tater. \u201cSee? That\u2019s why you\u2019n me didn\u2019t get along. You don\u2019t have no problem speakin\u2019 your mind.\u201d</p><p>Trevor laughed bitterly. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean I ain\u2019t never had a problem talkin\u2019 back to you? And if I recall, my face met the back of your hand every goddamn time I was stupid enough to speak my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t do no good. You\u2019ve still got that same smart mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI piss you off, you piss me off, old news. If you called me here because you needed someone new to fight with, I\u2019ll be hittin\u2019 the road. I\u2019ve got lots of stuff goin\u2019 on at home that I\u2019d rather be doin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>His father considered him in silence.</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d Trevor stood.</p><p>\u201cSit your ass back down. Now.\u201d</p><p>Trevor sat.</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019re right. I ain\u2019t ready to lay down and die. But this little spell has shown that I\u2019ve been short-sighted in decidin\u2019 the future for the Glanzer Ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, I ain\u2019t a lawyer. What does this have to do with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple. I\u2019m askin\u2019 you to move back here and take over. For real. No bullshit. No head games. I\u2019d put you in charge one hundred percent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn writin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>His dad squirmed, but he nodded. \u201cIn writing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re the only one with guts. Brent has no initiative. He\u2019s no better\u2019n a trained monkey; he\u2019ll do whatever your mother or I tell him to do. Same with Lianna, though she\u2019d like to tell us off, she don\u2019t have the balls. And Molly and her husband are both dumb as damn posts so they ain\u2019t any help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Tanner? I thought he raced back here to prove his loyalty, abidin\u2019 love and concern for you.\u201d Trevor couldn\u2019t stop the sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019d like everyone\u2014includin\u2019 me\u2014to think. Truth is, he sucks in the arena, he\u2019s pissed away any chance to compete in nationals yet again, and he thinks I\u2019m so damn dumb I don\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich tells me why you didn\u2019t pick Tanner, but it don\u2019t tell me why after I\u2019ve been considered a fuck-up my whole life, that all of a sudden you\u2019re offerin\u2019 this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you grew up, boy. No more whorin\u2019, drinkin\u2019, chasin\u2019 the rodeo dream.</p><p>You\u2019ve shown you can be responsible. By makin\u2019 your own way you\u2019ve shown I can trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo by me leavin\u2019 here...now you\u2019re offerin\u2019 me everything I ever wanted?\u201d Why did that scenario seem familiar? Because his situation with Edgard had gone along those same lines?</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo catch. I\u2019m serious. As a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>Trevor didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. He stood and paced. \u201cWho else knows about your change of heart attack?\u201d</p><p>His dad\u2019s rusty chuckle pieced the air. \u201cI ain\u2019t told no one, not even your ma. But I\u2019m sure Lianna and Brent suspect. Tanner thinks by suckin\u2019 up, I\u2019ll be swayed by his so-called charms.\u201d Tater harrumphed. \u201cGoddamn idiot. He knocked up another chick in Oklahoma right before Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother?\u201d Trevor scowled. \u201cHow many is that now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour. Three bastard grandbabies spread from California to Florida. Tanner ain\u2019t got a pot to piss in after he gets done payin\u2019 child support every month. And he could give a shit about any of them kids. The mothers don\u2019t want nothin\u2019 to do with him so the closest me\u2019n Starla come to seein\u2019 them is in pictures.\u201d</p><p>And yet Trevor didn\u2019t feel sorry for Tater. He\u2019d paid no attention to his own kids unless he was whipping them, so Trevor didn\u2019t know how Tanner was supposed to have turned out any differently as a father with Tater as a role model.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m also hopin\u2019 when you and Cassie start havin\u2019 babies you\u2019ll be close by so we can get to know \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife\u2019s name is Chassie, not Cassie, Pa,\u201d Trevor said tersely.</p><p>Tater waved him off. \u201cDon\u2019t matter just as long as them kids have the Glanzer last name.\u201d</p><p>His father started to cough. He kept coughing. Trevor handed him a glass of water and his dad choked on it. Just as he was starting to panic, the door flew open and Lianna raced in. She yelled, \u201cMove,\u201d and Trevor did.</p><p>Lianna rolled their dad to his side and slipped an oxygen mask over his face.</p><p>Immediately, Tater calmed down and closed his eyes. \u201cSlow and deep, Daddy. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She jerked her head toward the door as a sign for Trevor to leave.</p><p>His sister stormed to the dining room and spun around so fast she clipped him with her big belly. \u201cDo you see now? How he pretends to be fine but he\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I see. What\u2019s the coughing from?\u201d</p><p>Lianna rested her hands on her protruding stomach. \u201cEmphysema.\u201d</p><p>Trevor lifted both brows. \u201cAnd yet Ma is still smokin\u2019 around him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that oughta surprise you. She\u2019ll damn well smoke in her own goddamn house if she wants to.\u201d Lianna looked over his shoulder. \u201cMa\u2019s words not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe puffs away while she\u2019s takin\u2019 care of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe don\u2019t take care of him. Guess who gets stuck takin\u2019 care of him? Me. Tanner\u2019s gone most the time. Molly is a coupla bricks short of a load and Brent wouldn\u2019t rock the boat for nothin\u2019. I\u2019m not supposed to be doin\u2019 half this shit anyway.\u201d</p><p>Lianna practically invented martyrdom, but it was her own damn fault. \u201cThen why are you doin\u2019 it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see any other able-bodied family members lining up?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. But it ain\u2019t like Ma and Pa don\u2019t have the cash to hire a full-time nurse.\u201d Trevor looked Lianna straight in the eyes. \u201cYou know why you\u2019re stuck doin\u2019 this? Because you don\u2019t have the balls to stand up to them both and flat-out refuse.\u201d</p><p>Lianna\u2019s mouth opened. Snapped shut.</p><p>\u201cI know I ain\u2019t been around, so feel free to tell me to blow it out my ass, but if you don\u2019t take a stand, your only function will be takin\u2019 care of him while Ma smokes in the living room and does word searches all damn day. Is that the contribution you wanna have to the ranch? Think about it.\u201d Trevor snagged his coat and wandered outside. Damn cold. He stamped his boots and had no idea why he\u2019d left the warm comfort of the house.</p> <p>Comfort. Right. Not a word he\u2019d ever associate with the Glanzer abode.</p><p>He noticed Tanner\u2019s horse trailer and ambled over, beating his fist on the door to the living quarters until a thump sounded inside and the door swung open.</p><p>A shirtless Tanner squinted at him. \u201cWhat the fuck, Trevor? I was sleepin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s four in the afternoon. Why ain\u2019t you helpin\u2019 Brent with evenin\u2019 chores?\u201d</p><p>Tanner laughed. \u201cRight.\u201d Then he yawned in Trevor\u2019s face and scratched his ass.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m up. You might as well come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks.\u201d Trevor set an empty cardboard thirty-pack of Keystone Light on the floor so he could squeeze into the bench seat of the dinette table.</p><p>\u201cWanna beer?\u201d Tanner asked, cracking open the mini-fridge.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle wifey gotcha on a tight leash these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p> <p>Tanner popped a top. Then a shit-eating grin broke out across his face. \u201cYeah right.</p><p>The day you let anyone control you\u2014least of all a woman\u2014is the day I eat my hat.\u201d</p><p>Trevor studied his brother. Tanner\u2019s dark hair stuck up every which way. Dark stubble covered his jaw. Hickeys dotted his neck. Tanner\u2019s body frame was slight, and Trevor, at four inches taller, had always outweighed his brother. Not these days. Tanner packed on some serious poundage. His beer gut hung over the unbuttoned waistband of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cSo the old man called you back here.\u201d Tanner plopped on the other end of the bench seat.</p><p>\u201cWoulda been nice to know about Pa\u2019s heart attack right after it\u2019d happened, not a week later.\u201d</p><p>Tanner shrugged his thin shoulders. \u201cMaybe if you called to check in once in a while you\u2019d\u2019ve known.\u201d</p><p>His brother\u2019s attitude was another reminder on why Trevor had chosen to stay away.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, we all know why you\u2019re here.\u201d Tanner chugged the beer. \u201cPa\u2019s offerin\u2019 you full control of the place, ain\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>Trevor didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been his favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you babblin\u2019 about? Favorite. Right.\u201d Trevor snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s why I ain\u2019t been home in years. Because I\u2019m his favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ain\u2019t puttin\u2019 Brent in charge, or neither of the girls. So it leaves you and me as front runners.\u201d Tanner twisted the metal tab off the beer can and flicked it at the garbage, yelling, \u201cScore!\u201d and pumping his arms in the air when it pinged into the can. \u201cSo I propose a compromise. We tell Pa we\u2019re a package deal and we\u2019ll both run it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your rodeo career?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m havin\u2019 a bad go of it. Truth is, if it wasn\u2019t for all the free pussy I probably wouldn\u2019t be doin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t seem like the pussy is so free if you\u2019re knockin\u2019 up women all across the country and payin\u2019 child support,\u201d Trevor said slyly.</p><p>Tanner\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThat ornery fucker told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Four women? You think you\u2019d know what caused that condition by now, Tanner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was drunk. What can you do? Besides, I\u2019m tired of livin\u2019 on the pittance Pa gives me every month.\u201d</p><p>Trevor froze, even as his heart rate spiked. \u201cPa is payin\u2019 your way on the circuit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Didn\u2019t he pay yours?\u201d</p><p>Some favorite son. All the years he\u2019d scraped by, living on next to nothing, and his father had basically given Brent a blank check? That went beyond unfair to plain damn sadistic. \u201cHell no. If I didn\u2019t have enough money to pay the entry fees I didn\u2019t compete.</p><p>Which made it important for me to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t win.\u201d Meanness glinted in Tanner\u2019s bloodshot eyes. \u201cYou never brought home that all important World Championship belt buckle, didja?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made it a lot further than you ever did.\u201d</p><p>Tanner shrugged again. \u201cAlmost don\u2019t cut it. Might as well be at the bottom of the heap rather than stuck in second place.\u201d</p><p>Trevor stared at his brother. Surprised...yet not.</p><p>\u201cThat don\u2019t have nothin\u2019 to do with us runnin\u2019 the ranch.\u201d</p><p>It had everything to do with runnin\u2019 the ranch.</p><p>The whole scenario unfolded in Trevor\u2019s mind like a nightmare. He and Chassie would sell her family home and move here. He\u2019d do all the work. Brent would continue to be lazy, continue to lie, continue to think his charm made up for his lack of a work ethic. Brent would resent the hell out of him so he wouldn\u2019t do shit either. Neither his mother nor his sisters would welcome his wife into their inner circle so Chassie would be alone. After a few kids their marriage would end up like his parents\u2019 marriage and her parents\u2019 marriage.</p><p>Chassie wouldn\u2019t stick around if she was miserable. All these cheery scenarios were before Trevor considered Edgard couldn\u2019t be part of his life and the thought of losing either of them made him ill.</p><p>\u201c...told him I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Trevor refocused on his younger brother, chattering away, oblivious to Trevor\u2019s silent ruminations. He slid out of the bench seat and stood. \u201cI gotta call Chassie before supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeelin\u2019 the weight of that old ball and chain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d Trevor felt the weight of her absence like an iron ball in his heart and he bailed before Tanner subjected him to more of his so-called Wyoming charm.</p><p>Trevor tried Chassie\u2019s cell phone. No answer. He tried the house phone. No answer.</p><p>He paced in his room. Forcing himself to wait five minutes before he dialed again.</p><p>Finally after thirty minutes of beating a path in the carpet, Chassie picked up the house phone on the twelfth ring.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cChassie? Baby, you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you been? I\u2019ve been tryin\u2019 to call and you didn\u2019t answer your cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Umm. Edgard and I were in the barn and I must\u2019ve forgot it. We just walked in the house.\u201d</p><p>A rustling noise, like a hand clapped over the receiver.</p><p>\u201cChass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Shit. Hang on a second.\u201d Mumbled voices. Chassie snapping, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.</p><p>Don\u2019t even think about it. No!\u201d The receiver crashed and she shouted, \u201cGive it back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Trev, what\u2019s up?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell is goin\u2019 on there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019. How are things going with your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShitty.\u201d Trevor heard angry whispering.</p><p>Edgard said, \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Trevor stared at the phone in his hand. \u201cGood that things are goin\u2019 shitty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. No. Sorry, Chassie was yammering at me and I didn\u2019t hear what you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s washing her hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive her the goddamn phone. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Trevor heard them arguing although he couldn\u2019t make out the actual words, just the tone.</p><p>\u201cSo when you comin\u2019 home?\u201d In the background he heard Edgard say, \u201cTell him.\u201d</p><p>Trevor frowned. \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Tell you how much we miss you.\u201d</p><p>Edgard snorted so loudly Trevor heard him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happenin\u2019 with your family?\u201d Chassie asked.</p><p>\u201cMy dad offered me full responsibility for runnin\u2019 the ranch. Permanently. He\u2019ll put it in writin\u2019 and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Chassie sputtered, \u201cB-but you aren\u2019t actually considering it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. It could be a great opportunity for us.\u201d He was such a fucking liar.</p><p>One lousy day around his family and he gave into the urge to be mean to the people he loved just because he could. Just because he was confused and pissed off they weren\u2019t telling him something, and dammit he missed them. Missed being a part of them. Missed who he was when he was with them.</p><p>Silence. Then fierce whispers. Then a sniffle.</p><p>Jesus. Chassie wasn\u2019t crying? \u201cChass? Baby, you okay?\u201d</p><p>Edgard snatched the phone. \u201cNo, she\u2019s not okay. Don\u2019t do this, Trev. Please. Not to her. Not to me, and not to yourself. I\u2019m asking you to wait before making a rash decision.\u201d</p><p>The phone crashed again. Sounded like they were wrestling for it. In a rush, Chassie said, \u201cI love you, Trevor. I know you think you have to figure this out on your own, but you don\u2019t. You have us\u2014both me and Edgard\u2014to help you. Come home to us and we\u2019ll talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Two raps echoed on his door. \u201cTrevor?\u201d Lianna said. \u201cWe\u2019re takin\u2019 Dad into the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChassie. I hafta go. I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d He hung up.</p><p>The rest of the evening was a cluster-fuck of epic proportions. By the time Trevor returned to his room, it was past midnight. Too late to call. Or was he too much of a chickenshit to call because he owed them both an apology?</p><p>Either way, he\u2019d make that request for forgiveness in person. He\u2019d grovel if he had to...without qualifications. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>Chassie sat in the same place at the kitchen table an hour later when Edgard returned to the house. He snagged a beer from the fridge and straddled the chair opposite hers.</p><p>Finally she looked up. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill Greta, did you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Her reprieve might be short-lived though when Trevor catches wind of it.\u201d</p><p>Edgard took a long, slow drink and eyed the bandage on her forehead. \u201cYou should\u2019ve told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it be, Edgard.\u201d</p><p>Edgard sighed. Not that he blamed her, but Chassie\u2019d been extremely grouchy all day. Hadn\u2019t helped matters hearing Trevor snap off the news he was considering his father\u2019s offer to run the Glanzer Ranch on a permanent basis. Not that Edgard believed Trevor would follow through. It reminded Edgard that sometimes Trevor could be thoughtless and a little mean to those he loved just because he didn\u2019t know better.</p><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s just...\u201d Chassie sipped her warm milk, scowling when she realized it\u2019d gone cold. \u201cTrev didn\u2019t seem the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrevor is different when he\u2019s around them. Breaking free from his family was the best thing he ever did. I can\u2019t imagine why he\u2019d jump back in that cesspool when he\u2019s created utopia here with you.\u201d</p><p>Chassie offered a wan smile. \u201cYou\u2019re so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d He scrutinized her face and glanced at the clock. \u201cYou take your meds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hungry? Want me to fix you some supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m tired. I really just wanna lay down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me help you upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Stop fussin\u2019 at me, Ed. I\u2019ll just crash on the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like fussin\u2019 at you, so tough up.\u201d Edgard stood. \u201cWill you at least let me tuck you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d Chassie pushed to her feet and grabbed the cordless receiver. \u201cAnd if it\u2019ll make you happy, I\u2019ll tell Trevor about the rodeo tattoo Greta\u2019s hoof left on my forehead if he calls back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He kissed the area around the bandage and herded her into the living room. After covering her with a blanket, he headed upstairs to shower.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, the receiver nearly dropped from Chassie\u2019s nerveless fingers.</p><p>Her whole body had gone numb and she blinked with disbelief, all thoughts of sleep forgotten.</p><p>\u201cChass? Who was that on the phone? Trevor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. It was Keely McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>The words stuck in her throat.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re scaring me, what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin Cameron McKay is missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Chassie swallowed. Her mouth still felt dry as dust. \u201cThe army sent notification to the family that Cam and two other guys were left behind on patrol in Iraq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Remember when Kade mentioned it was as if that whole family had gone on vacation together? That\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. How long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not sure. A bomb exploded, knocking out the first two vehicles in a caravan. Cam and his guys got out of their vehicle to help the injured when two more IEDs were detonated. People scattered and took cover. In the mass confusion of smoke, casualties and gunfire, the vehicles remaining in the caravan were ordered to retreat. The brass didn\u2019t realize they\u2019d left Cam and the other guys behind until they\u2019d returned to camp.\u201d</p><p>Edgard didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cThe army sent search parties out. Found nothin\u2019 so far.\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut, but it didn\u2019t block out the horrors filling her brain. \u201cThey may never find him or a trace of him. Or the others. How do you deal with that? At least with Dag...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, now. Take a deep breath. I\u2019m not gonna tell you everything is gonna be sunshiny rainbows, but sometimes no news is good news.\u201d</p><p>Chassie folded her arms over her chest. \u201cKnow what I hate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat your aunt and uncle and cousins kept this information to themselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s damn near impossible in a close-knit family to know where to draw the line. Carolyn and Carson elected to keep their immediate offspring in the loop. It is their right. I can\u2019t imagine that was a painless decision with the way the McKays seem to live in each other\u2019s back pockets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re defending them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, querida, I\u2019m trying to give you a different perspective on how different people deal with a difficult family situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about difficult family issues, Ed? Trevor told me your family was all sunshiny rainbows\u201d\u2014she tossed his words back at him\u2014\u201cabout you bein\u2019 gay.</p><p>That you had complete acceptance and their support of your lifestyle. How can you possibly understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Edgard stormed from the room.</p><p>Chassie was flabbergasted he\u2019d taken off mid-sentence, so she followed him to give him a piece of her mind. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t walk away as I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to you, Edgard. It\u2019s rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what else is rude? To make assumptions when you don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about. Only hearing what you wanna hear and tuning everything else out.</p><p>My life ain\u2019t ever been sunshiny rainbows, so don\u2019t tell me...\u201d Edgard rattled off a long phrase in Portuguese. \u201cFuck this. Forget it.\u201d</p><p>A bad feeling persisted that had nothing to do with Cam. \u201cWhat kind of assumptions have I made?\u201d</p><p>He flapped his hand in the air, waving her off.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d She racked her brain, backtracking on conversations that might\u2019ve held clues she missed. His deflection of answering questions about his ranch. He\u2019d talked of his last relationship and how he\u2019d taken the man to meet his mother. His mother. Whoa. Then she remembered. \u201cWhat happened after your mother died, Edgard?\u201d</p><p>Edgard whirled around and his face was as cold and hard as an icicle. \u201cMy family disowned me.\u201d</p><p>Chassie automatically stepped back in the face of his rage. \u201cHow can they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently my mother was the only one who didn\u2019t have an issue with my so-called perversion. Evidently she\u2019d kept my stepfather and my brothers and sister in line. So I\u2019d lived years with the lie of complete acceptance about my sexuality. The only reason my family\u201d\u2014he spit the word as if it tasted bad\u2014\u201ctolerated me was because of my mother\u2019s threats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of threats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinancial threats. See, my grandparents\u2014my mother\u2019s parents\u2014were rich. She became their only child after my uncle Ramon was murdered when I was eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ed, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it gets worse. Turned into a big ugly political deal, no one knew if my uncle\u2019s murder was a botched kidnapping and extortion attempt. My mother sent me to the U.S. to live with my real father\u2019s parents for the summer in some misguided attempt at protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d kept in contact with me. Luckily my English was excellent. After I passed the Wyoming test as a real cowboy adept at ridin\u2019 and ropin\u2019, they took me to a rodeo. I was hooked. Especially after I began to win.\u201d A ghostly smile appeared. \u201cI stuck around for three months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they know you were gay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you...you know...figure it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst time with a girl was at sixteen. First time with a boy was at eighteen. When I turned nineteen I told my mother which I preferred. She saw no reason to keep it a dirty secret and blabbed to my entire family. Everyone acted supportive. Or so I thought,\u201d he added bitterly.</p><p>Her thoughts drifted momentarily to Dag. No one in their family would\u2019ve granted him that false sense of security, even temporarily.</p><p>\u201cI returned to the States when I was twenty-two to make a name for myself in U.S.</p><p>rodeo. Figured out PDQ how \u2018real\u2019 cowboys feel about gays so I stayed in the closet. Had a few random encounters in bigger cities. Was lonely as hell but making enough money to buy my own place in Brazil. I stuck it out for two years before I thought about going home.</p><p>\u201cThen I met Trevor. Instantly fell hard, but somehow managed to keep that from him. I was just goddamn happy to be around him all the time. We traveled together as partners, relied on each other for everything until one day he began to look at me differently. And I knew he\u2019d picked up on how I felt about him. I also knew it fucked him up. By the end of the first year of our partnership we were lovers.</p><p>\u201cAnd yeah, I harbored romantic delusions about him pulling up stakes and moving with me to Brazil. After another two years passed of us being together, but not really being together, I left him because I wanted his public acknowledgement of our relationship. Having it in private wasn\u2019t good enough for me.\u201d</p><p>Chassie bit her lip to keep from crying at the unfiltered anguish in his voice.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, I was so childish and needy about proving to everyone that he belonged to me. So stupidly self-righteous and so very, very wrong that I threw it away on a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA total fucking lie.\u201d Edgard punched the couch cushion, shocking Chassie and himself with his angry gesture. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just... About a year and a half after I returned home, my mother died in a car accident. In addition to losing the only person who\u2019d understood me, my father\u2014 stepfather\u2014told me his true feelings; he didn\u2019t accept me as a gay man, never had, never would. I was perverted, an embarrassment to his name, his family, to God and the church. He expected me to leave and never return. Problem was, as the oldest male child I was set to inherit everything of my mother\u2019s, which meant cutting out his children.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour brothers and sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.

That\u2019s why Edgard had come back.</p><p>Not to steal Trevor away, but to remind himself of something that\u2019d been good in his life.</p><p>Or maybe he\u2019d come back to cement his disillusionment that his time with Trevor hadn\u2019t been the sunshiny rainbows he\u2019d remembered?</p><p>Poor Edgard. Still grasping at straws, even when he knew them to be hollow. God. It wasn\u2019t fair. Why did everything have to be so damn hard? Chassie placed her hands over her face and sobbed.</p><p>Strong arms wrapped around her. It took a while for the warmth and heat to offer any solace and she felt guilty for taking from Edgard when she should\u2019ve been giving to him.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s so not fair. Why does bad shit always seem to happen to good people?\u201d</p><p>Breathy kisses dotted the crown of her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Cam, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her face from his wet shirtfront and blinked at him. \u201cYou think that\u2019s why I\u2019m cryin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Leeriness entered his eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not cryin\u2019 about Cam, you big dummy. I\u2019m cryin\u2019 about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cMy heart is busted clean apart after hearin\u2019 what you\u2019ve been through. Alone.</p><p>You\u2019re hurtin\u2019 so bad and I just wanna fix it. Goddammit, I\u2019d hoped we\u2019d gotten past these secrets and you\u2019ve been keepin\u2019 a big one from me and I\u2019ll bet Trevor too, huh?</p> <p>He nodded warily.</p><p>\u201cI wanna punch you and I wanna hug you, you big stupid jerk.\u201d Chassie mashed her face into Edgard\u2019s chest as more tears poured out in hiccupping stutters.</p><p>She tried to squirm away after she\u2019d calmed down. \u201cSorry about blubbering all over you and swearin\u2019 at you.\u201d</p><p>Edgard tipped her chin up. His eyes were wet and shone pure gold. \u201cDo you realize you\u2019re the first person who\u2019s cried for me? It is very humbling. Very sweet, and so very...you, Chassie. You\u2019ve a soft heart and an iron will. It is a potent combination.\u201d</p><p>A funny tickle started low in her belly. \u201cAh. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s eyes zeroed in on her mouth. Their bodies were still locked together. \u201cCan you smile for me? So I can taste the happiness on your lips when I kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finally gonna kiss me?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all the sexual gymnastics we\u2019ve tried, the one thing you haven\u2019t done is give me a real kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that is, querida?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because you prefer a mustache on the upper lip of the person you\u2019re smooching?\u201d</p><p>Edgard laughed softly. \u201cTrevor doesn\u2019t have a mustache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you just prefer Trevor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be. But how will I know I don\u2019t prefer your kisses if I don\u2019t give you a fair shot, hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds logical.\u201d Chassie moistened her lips in expectation.</p><p>He bent his head, his gaze solely focused on her lips. Then a soft press of his mouth to hers. He retreated a fraction of an inch, letting his breath fan over hers, letting her anticipation build.</p><p>And build.</p><p>Her nervous habit of biting her lower lip had him growling. He nibbled the fleshy inside rim. His tongue dipped in, delicately tracing the seam, back and forth. Each wet stroke delved a little deeper. But never all the way.</p><p>A whimper escaped.</p><p>Then Edgard\u2019s hands were on her head and he kissed her voraciously. Thrusting his tongue past her teeth, tasting every inch of her mouth as thoroughly as he pleased.</p><p>The change from exploratory to conquering made her wet and weak-kneed. She clung to him, lost, craving every single sensation this complex man could offer her.</p><p>He backed off to whisper across her lips, \u201cNo need to grow a mustache, darlin\u2019. You kiss just fine. Much better than fine.\u201d</p><p>She smiled against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I was gonna ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were gonna ask if you can pin me against the wall and fuck me, \u2019cause you\u2019re feelin\u2019 all close to me and stuff now that you\u2019ve spilled your guts, and stopped bein\u2019 the strong silent type of tough guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmartass.\u201d Edgard dropped another kiss on her jaw. \u201cBut yes, that was it. I want you, Chassie.\u201d He dragged his mouth down her throat. \u201cI wanna bury myself in your sweet heat. Lose myself in the softness that is you inside and out.\u201d</p><p>Chassie rolled her hips into his, getting a heady sense of satisfaction that Edgard was already hard. For her.</p><p>\u201cPants off,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cRace you.\u201d She stepped out of her jeans and panties.</p><p>He ditched his jeans, snagged a condom from his pocket and rolled it on. Before Chassie doffed her remaining clothes, Edgard picked her up and pinned her upper body to the wall with his muscular torso. He spread her knees wide and slipped inside her.</p><p>\u201cOh. Wow. That\u2019s...\u201d Chassie braced herself for a hard, fast fuck, knowing his preference for rough, dominant sex.</p><p>But Edgard stilled. He caressed the tops of her thighs and rotated his hands to cup her ass. Then he rocked his pelvis, pulling out of her wet cunt completely, pausing, and easing back inside on a slow glide until he couldn\u2019t go any deeper. \u201cYou like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Edgard\u2019s kisses were as unhurried as his thrusts and she was totally undone at his gentleness.</p><p>Her body coiled with eagerness, yet was loose limbed with pleasure. When she realized she\u2019d been wallowing in sexual gratification and not reciprocating, she slid her hands from his wide shoulders, across his collarbones and stopped at the hollow of his throat.</p><p>Chassie unbuttoned his shirt, seeking contact with his skin. She loved touching every ridge of his pectorals as her fingers sought the tight male nipples hidden in the hair on his chest.</p><p>Edgard groaned. \u201cPinch them harder.\u201d</p><p>As she alternated pinching and rasping her thumbs over the hardened nubs, she playfully used her teeth on the strong line of his jaw. That bristly section of his beard scraped her lips and tongue. The valley between his ear and his jawbone seemed to be the source for his intoxicating male scent. She rubbed her mouth, her cheek, her nose in that secret spot, steeping her senses in him, in Edgard, this man who\u2019d gone from her friend to her rival to her lover.</p><p>\u201cArch your neck so I can taste you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>His mouth connected unerringly with sensitive spots to send her flesh tingling and her head buzzing. She moaned with complete abandon.</p><p>His focus on every nuance of her pleasure was absolute. Wasn\u2019t long before her climax swirled through her, not in a sudden burst, but drawn-out twinges that sated her body and filled her soul with an impression of rightness.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s rhythm accelerated. He plunged deep and his cock jerked, bathing her clenching channel with heat she felt through the latex.</p><p>When he whispered, \u201cChassie,\u201d in her hair, her world tilted, her emotions shifted, becoming clearer. She cared about him, not because of Trevor, but because he brought something different to her, something just for her. Edgard was as much a part of Trevor as she was and Edgard was rapidly becoming part of her too.</p><p>Chassie let the silence linger while they each caught their breath, leery of ruining the moment.</p><p>Edgard sighed and nuzzled her cheek. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty stunned, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStunned that you enjoyed it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. How many times do I have to tell you I\u2019ve loved every second of touching you and being with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m a woman. Isn\u2019t that like against the gay guys\u2019 creed?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her ass. \u201cDammit, that reminds me, I forgot to check the gay man\u2019s handbook. And nailing a real chick\u2014not a man in drag\u2014against the wall, probably will get me permanently kicked out of the club. Then again, a smart cookie like you knows I wouldn\u2019t have considered fucking you at all if it hadn\u2019t been for our separate relationships with Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet, this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve done this, Ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is the first time we\u2019ve made love alone without Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Is that why it is so stunning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m stunned by the way you make me feel, Chass.\u201d He pressed his mouth to hers. \u201cWorthy.\u201d A soft brush of his lips. \u201cSafe.\u201d Another kiss. \u201cThat I have value to you beyond what we both feel for Trevor.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Don\u2019t cry.</p><p>Her head thunked back and tears trickled down.</p><p>\u201cNo, querida, don\u2019t. Please.\u201d Edgard kissed away her tears, murmuring Portuguese sweet-nothings until her cheeks were dry.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so goddamned gentlemanly and sweet to me all the time?\u201d Chassie asked half-gruffly, secretly basking in the tender way he soothed her.</p><p>Edgard leaned back to gaze in her eyes. \u201cBecause you let me. Because I can be softer with you and you don\u2019t think any less of me, don\u2019t consider me less of a man. You bring out a side in me I\u2019d nearly forgotten and your acceptance of it is one of my favorite things about you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad something is appealing, since I don\u2019t have the appendage you prefer.\u201d</p><p>He smiled gently. \u201cJoke all you want. But I understand now, maybe more than I ever did, Trevor\u2019s confusion when he started having feelings for me. I have those same confusing moments with you, Chass. You\u2019re not my type, yet I realize for the first time that you really don\u2019t fall for a person\u2019s gender or appendage so much as you fall for the person. And I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m not falling for you, Chassie West Glanzer.\u201d</p><p>In that instant everything between them changed.</p> <p>\u201cI love him,\u201d Chassie said softly.</p><p>\u201cI know. I love him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do if he really wants to make a go of it with his family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any idea.\u201d</p><p>Silence descended as they stared at each other helplessly.</p> <p>Edgard withdrew and set her back on her feet. He kept his back to her as he pulled on his jeans and buttoned his shirt. \u201cWhat are your plans for the rest of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d She snatched her jeans but didn\u2019t bother putting them on. \u201cPretend I\u2019m not worryin\u2019 about Trevor walkin\u2019 away from both of us for a bigger piece of goddamn dirt. Pretend I\u2019m not worryin\u2019 about what my McKay relatives are dealin\u2019 with.\u201d Pretend you didn\u2019t just turn me inside out.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you oughta hit the hay early since it\u2019s been a rough day. How\u2019s your head?\u201d</p><p>Chassie kissed his Adam\u2019s apple. \u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s sore, and I probably should lay down. But if you tell Trevor I like that you fuss at me I\u2019ll punch you in the stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart man. I will take your advice and change into my pajamas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to wear them on my account, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She swatted him on the arm. \u201cJust for that Trevor-ism, I\u2019ll be head to toe in granny flannel tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill won\u2019t deter me.\u201d He stole another kiss as he dodged another swat. \u201cI\u2019ll do the last check and be up in a bit.\u201d</p><p>Trevor woke up cranky and lonely. No one was up in the house yet, so he headed outside to help Brent with morning chores, only to learn Brent relied entirely on the three hired men to do everything.</p><p>Problem was the hired men did everything wrong and didn\u2019t seem to give a shit.</p><p>When Brent finally showed up around ten o\u2019clock, Trevor didn\u2019t hold back his anger.</p><p>\u201cGlad you could grace me with your presence. Those hired men are worthless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeast I have hired men.\u201d Brent permitted a mean smile. \u201cJealous?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf you still actin\u2019 all Lord of the Manor?\u201d Trevor spit tobacco on the ground by Brent\u2019s polished and pristine Lucchese boots. \u201cHell no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t understand what it takes to run an operation this size.</p><p>Bein\u2019s that your \u2018ranch\u2019\u201d\u2014Brent made exaggerated quotes marks in the air\u2014\u201cis the size of a postage stamp.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t take the bait.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your acreage?\u201d Brent taunted. \u201cYou even have a thousand acres?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t take the bait.</p><p>\u201cMy wife has a garden that size.\u201d</p><p>Somehow Trevor stopped himself from snapping off, \u201cYour wife needs that much room to move her fat ass around.\u201d Instead he started stacking feed buckets, keeping his back to his brother.</p><p>A sarcastic laugh sounded behind him. \u201cWell, well. You\u2019re not fightin\u2019 back. That must mean you are embarrassed and there is truth to the rumor. How far the mighty have fallen.\u201d</p><p>Clunk. Thud. Trevor focused on aligning the buckets biggest to smallest and not how much he wanted to pummel his brother\u2019s face into the ground.</p><p>\u201cPa ain\u2019t foolin\u2019 anyone. He just brought you here as a threat to keep me and Tanner in line. He\u2019ll never give you control, Trevor.\u201d</p><p>Tell him. Rub it in his face that it wasn\u2019t a threat but a reality. That Pa promised to put it in writing.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how much I\u2019m enjoyin\u2019 seein\u2019 you crawlin\u2019 back here,\u201d Brent hissed. \u201cKnowin\u2019 you got nothin\u2019. You might act like you don\u2019t give a shit, but if that\u2019s the case, why\u2019d you bother to show up at all, huh?\u201d</p><p>That observation gave Trevor pause. Why had he shown up? When he had everything he\u2019d ever wanted waiting for him at home? How long did have to pretend to show a sense of familial duty? How long did he have to suffer for his unfortunate birthright? And why in the hell was he listening to another family member berate and belittle him? When he hated the person he became every time he was around these people?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no different than the rest of us. Stuck, a suck-up, just like us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nothin\u2019 like you. Any of you.\u201d</p><p>It clicked. Once and for all. How true that statement was. How true it\u2019d always been.</p><p>After Trevor said it aloud, he finally believed it.</p><p>All he had to do was act on it. Not here, but at home, his real home, where he mattered. Where his heart was. Where he was the man he\u2019d always wanted to be. Where his declaration of intent, of love, of change wouldn\u2019t be sneered at, but embraced.</p><p>He practically burned the rubber off the soles of his boots getting to the house. He bounded up to his room to grab his duffel bag. He didn\u2019t stop to chat with his brothers, sisters, and mother gathered in the kitchen; he headed straight for the front door.</p><p>\u201cTrevor!\u201d his mother shouted. \u201cWait. Tater wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Trevor half-turned, keeping one hand on the doorknob. \u201cI\u2019ll pass. You tell him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t just leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can. I\u2019m goin\u2019 home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d He shut the heavy door behind him and didn\u2019t look back, and knew he never would again.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>After she and Edgard finished chores, Chassie couldn\u2019t justify staying away from her McKay relatives. She couldn\u2019t stand the idea of them hurting alone so she whipped up a batch of sugar cookies and left Edgard in charge.</p><p>She parked her rattletrap pickup alongside Keely\u2019s sporty car at the McKay house and tamped down envy. Although the McKays weren\u2019t wealthy, they exceeded their local rancher counterparts of being \u201cland rich and cash poor\u201d. During a drunken rant, her father had let it slip the McKays\u2019 spread was bigger than a couple European countries. Since sections of their land sat on coal and methane gas beds, they might be as ungodly rich as royalty someday.</p><p>The McKays\u2019 access to funds didn\u2019t bode well for her and Trevor. They\u2019d never scrape up the money to buy Gus\u2019s land and another part and parcel would be added to the McKays\u2019 vast holdings. Still, she wouldn\u2019t allow her jealousy of their success drive another wedge between them. Dag\u2019s funeral had ended the seven-decade-long feud involving the West and McKay families, and she intended to do her part to keep it that way.</p><p>Despite the years of infighting between her father and Carson McKay, Aunt Carolyn had always welcomed her into the McKay stronghold with open arms. Since Chassie, Keely and their cousin Ramona West were the only girls, Aunt C made doubly sure they spent time alone away from their wild boy cousins.</p><p>Chassie\u2019s thoughts flew to Cam. She couldn\u2019t comprehend not ever seeing his teasing smile again. Or being a victim of his practical jokes. Or watching him lace up his battered running shoes before he took off on his daily ten-mile run. Cam\u2019s life obsessions were working out and guns. No one had been particularly surprised when he\u2019d enlisted in the armed forces. But his family was shocked when he\u2019d made the military\u2014not the McKay Ranch\u2014his career.</p><p>She balanced the tin of cookies. She\u2019d barely climbed the steps when her cousin Colt stepped on the porch.</p><p>No smile adorned his lean face and the lines around his eyes were drawn with worry.</p><p>\u201cChassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt.\u201d</p><p>His gaze zoomed to the bandage on her face. \u201cGirl, what happened to your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun in with a goat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like she bested ya, darlin\u2019.\u201d He pointed at the tin. \u201cWhatcha got in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar cookies for Aunt Carolyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, it was real sweet of you to drive all the way over here. I\u2019m sure Ma will appreciate the goodies once she\u2019s feelin\u2019 better.\u201d Colt attempted to snatch the tin from her hands even as he blocked the door.</p><p>Chassie kept the cookies out of reach. \u201cI\u2019d rather give them to her in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019d love to see you too, Chass,\u201d he inserted with his usual charm, \u201cbut it\u2019d be better if you let her heal up first\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the shit, Colt. Keely called me and told me about Cam.\u201d Colt started to deny it but Chassie held up her hand. \u201cAunt C was a lifeline to normalcy after Dag and my dad died and I just wanna see if there\u2019s anything I can do for her, okay?\u201d</p><p>That comment stopped him cold.</p><p>Colt studied her, then led them into the house. The stone cold quiet house. The McKay household existed in a perpetual state of chaos and Chassie shivered at the eerie stillness.</p><p>She hung her winter jacket on the antique coat tree and dropped the cookies in the messy kitchen\u2014whoa, Carolyn\u2019s domain was never in disarray\u2014and hung a right into her aunt\u2019s sitting room.</p><p>The space, a merry mix of yellow and red, didn\u2019t offer the usual cheer. Chassie\u2019s heart hurt seeing her normally vibrant aunt subdued. Carolyn McKay always looked put together, whether she wore faded, dusty Wranglers and a Western shirt or a cocktail dress. Today was no exception.</p><p>But there was an edge Chassie hadn\u2019t seen before. A sense that one wrong word, one wrong move, one wrong look, and she\u2019d unravel like the skein of yarn in her lap.</p><p>Chassie watched Carolyn knitting feverishly. The result of her rapidly moving fingers was a pale blue lump piled beside her. Carolyn didn\u2019t glance up when she said, </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKeely shouldn\u2019t have told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad she did, Aunt C.\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p> <p>Chassie crossed the room, her sock feet silent on the wooden floor. She sat on Carolyn\u2019s left side. Click click click as the metal needles whipped the yarn into shape.</p><p>Neither one spoke for the longest time, which was fine by Chassie. She honestly didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>Aunt Carolyn babbled, \u201cI\u2019ve been putting off finishing this baby blanket for Carter and Macie\u2019s newest addition. You know she\u2019s due any day, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby is a boy. Always a boy in this family, so I have every color of blue yarn you could imagine. I wanted something different for each of my grandchildren. Thane\u2019s baby blanket is navy blue and Kyler\u2019s blanket is turquoise. It\u2019s so sweet Ky still needs that blanket every night before he can sleep even when he claims to be a big boy. Gib\u2019s blanket is robin\u2019s egg blue. Channing won\u2019t let him have it in his crib anymore because she\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll tie it around the slats and use it to climb out.\u201d</p> <p>Chassie smiled. That sounded like the little wild man.</p><p>\u201cI say what goes around comes around because Colby was my climber. Cord always stayed put, patiently waiting for me to lift him out. Colt persuaded Cord and Colby to break him out of his playpen soon as he could talk. Such a charmer at an early age and that hasn\u2019t changed. And Cam. Cam rattled the bars on his baby jail until I feared he\u2019d rip them out. When Carter was born I thought Cam would accidentally hurt him because Cam was such a big kid. But Cam was gentle with both Carter and Keely. And patient.</p><p>Lord, his size scared a lot of folks. Cam is strong and smart and he can\u2019t be...there\u2019s no way. No way. They\u2019re wrong. They\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>The clicking stopped. So did Chassie\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cOh God. I can\u2019t do this...I can\u2019t...he\u2019s not...not Cam...not one of mine. Not mine.\u201d</p><p>Chassie gently set the knitting aside and circled her arm around Carolyn\u2019s shoulder as she sobbed. Chassie cried silently right along with her, her emotions ripped into shreds.</p> <p>A cracking noise sounded, followed by a grunt as Carson crouched in front of Carolyn.</p><p>Her uncle\u2019s face wasn\u2019t the usual blank mask, but pinched and pale. Haggard. He paid no attention to Chassie; his sole focus was on his wife. Picking up Carolyn\u2019s hands from her lap, he kissed her fingertips. \u201cSugar?\u201d</p><p>Carolyn met his gaze. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ask me if I\u2019m all right or I swear to God I\u2019ll scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-o-okay,\u201d Carson said evenly. \u201cMaybe you oughta\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare suggest I go lay down either, Carson McKay, or so help me God I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d A great gasping sob erupted.</p><p>\u201cHey, now, hush.\u201d Carson tenderly kissed Carolyn\u2019s palms and the tips of her fingers, then rubbed her knuckles over his razor-stubbled cheeks like her skin was the finest silk. His actions seemed to calm them both a little.</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat were you gonna say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might wanna give your poor fingers a break for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve gotta get this done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. But grandbaby number four ain\u2019t gonna appreciate you bleedin\u2019 all over his blanket any more than I would.\u201d</p><p>Chassie should\u2019ve excused herself. But this sweet, solicitous side of her brusque uncle staggered her. She\u2019d never seen Carson McKay as an affectionate man, least of all with his wife. She hadn\u2019t thought him capable, given what Chassie\u2019s father said about Carson being the coldest, most calculating SOB he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>But how much of her father\u2019s perceptions were borne out of jealousy? Uncle Carson, while unfailingly polite to her, always made himself scarce when she\u2019d visited his home.</p><p>In truth, he may\u2019ve been all touchy-feely and she wouldn\u2019t have seen it.</p><p>\u201cMy fingers aren\u2019t bleeding, Carson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Caro, please give \u2019em a rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need something to do with my hands. I\u2019m goin\u2019 crazy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sugar, me too.\u201d Carson closed his eyes as Carolyn touched his face. The harshest, tightest lines around his mouth relaxed and he sighed as she rubbed his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re strung just as tight as me, McKay. Should I give AJ a call and see if she\u2019d swing by and give you a massage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d His steely blue eyes opened and held a hint of challenge. \u201cIf you do something for me first.\u201d</p><p>When Carolyn arched an eyebrow, Carson grinned. A flat-out bad boy grin, just like the one he\u2019d passed onto his sons. \u201cNot that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be a first,\u201d Carolyn murmured. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>Carson kissed Carolyn\u2019s knuckles. \u201cI thought you might say that. But Chassie brought cookies. It\u2019d be rude not to try \u2019em after she went to all that trouble to bake \u2019em fresh and bring \u2019em over here first thing this mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Chassie bit back a smile. Carson McKay was a sneaky man. Using Aunt Carolyn\u2019s innate politeness against her. It had the desired affect because Carolyn caved.</p><p>\u201cMaybe just one or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d Carson helped Carolyn to her feet. \u201cAnd some milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. You\u2019re too wired as it is. No coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, bossy man. Juice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>All at once Carolyn seemed to remember Chassie. \u201cKeely\u2019s up in her room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Carson curled his weathered hands over Carolyn\u2019s shoulders, keeping their bodies close as he directed her toward the kitchen.</p><p>The McKay house was large enough to have two sets of stairs\u2014a formal set in the front and a narrow set leading upstairs and into the cellar. Chassie took the front set and ambled down the long hallway, pausing to look at the pictures adorning the walls.</p><p>Everything from Carter\u2019s stunning paintings, to family photos dating back to the turn of the century, to Kyler\u2019s preschool handprints. She\u2019d always loved Aunt Carolyn\u2019s mixed-up, stylish yet personal, decorating style.</p><p>She passed several closed oak doors, knocking at one in the middle.</p><p>Keely flung open the door with spit in her eye. Her rigid posture relaxed when she realized it was Chassie. After a quick hug, she motioned Chassie into the room. \u201cThank God it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that nasty look wasn\u2019t meant for your mom or dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was for Colt.\u201d Keely frowned at her desk. \u201cSorry there\u2019s no other chairs in here. You\u2019re gonna hafta sit on the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be like old times.\u201d Chassie\u2019s gaze swept the girlish room. Ruffled white eyelet canopy above the bed. Bright pink Priscilla curtains hung at both windows. A vanity with a lighted mirror panel was shoved along one wall and piled with clothes, shoes and makeup. An overflowing bookcase opposite it crammed with romance novels. Posters of bull riders, bullfighters, PRCA bronc riders were plastered on the lavender walls. Official printouts for the Dodge pro rodeo final standings for the years Colby competed were tacked here and there. Chassie resisted the urge to search for Trevor\u2019s name, instead focusing on her cousin. \u201cReally like old times. Wow. This room is exactly the same.\u201d</p><p>Keely plopped in a wheeled office chair. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d She pointed to a bottle of Malibu rum on the dresser. \u201cBack then Daddy would\u2019ve confiscated that immediately.</p><p>But now that I\u2019m of age...\u201d She sighed. \u201cMaybe you should confiscate it. Been drinking way more than I should in the last few days.\u201d</p><p>Chassie hopped on the bed and let her legs dangle over the side. \u201cDare I ask if there\u2019s any more news on Cam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. Every time a goddamn car comes up the driveway, we panic, afraid it\u2019s an official army rep here to tell us...\u201d Tears spilled down Keely\u2019s cheeks. \u201cI can\u2019t say it.</p><p>And some really superstitious part of me thinks if I don\u2019t say it, it won\u2019t happen. Stupid, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot stupid. Hopeful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Keely wiped her nose. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I brought you into this, Chass. Last night I had a fight with Colt, then I got into the rum and called you. I just needed to vent to someone who wasn\u2019t in this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you called me. I\u2019ll also admit I\u2019m a little pissed off that you guys have been dealin\u2019 with this for over a week without tellin\u2019 anyone else in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly. I don\u2019t get why we have to keep it a secret.\u201d</p><p>Chassie plucked at a thread on the quilt. \u201cMaybe Aunt C is superstitious like you are.</p><p>If she doesn\u2019t tell people he\u2019s missin\u2019, it can\u2019t be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God. I never considered that.\u201d Keely drifted off for a minute.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you and Colt fightin\u2019 about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s bored. He wants to go home, but he can\u2019t because he\u2019ll tell Buck what\u2019s going on. Dad insists since Colt and I are the only unmarried kids we\u2019re here as support for Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long are you here for?\u201d Chassie pointed at the open laptop on the desk.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be in school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am in school. My instructors are letting me keep up online for now, but I\u2019m set to start clinicals in two weeks and that\u2019s something I can\u2019t miss.\u201d Keely twisted a section of her dark hair around her finger\u2014a rare nervous gesture. \u201cSo in between studying, I\u2019m trying to talk to Mom, but all she does is knit and drink coffee. Dad barks orders at Cord and Colby over the phone and paces when he\u2019s not obsessing over seeing my mother falling to pieces. Colt deals with all the chores around here and anyone who calls or stops by. He has the worst of it, but that doesn\u2019t give him the right to nag at me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNag at you about what?\u201d</p><p>Keely shrugged. \u201cMy plans after I get out of school. My love life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of your love life...how is Justin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cHe broke up with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Colt is nagging me about. I won\u2019t tell him, even when he offered to cut off that \u2018little bastard\u2019s prick and feed it to him\u2019.\u201d Keely\u2019s lips turned up, but it was a pale imitation of her usual bad girl grin. \u201cMuch as I love Colt\u2019s threatening swagger, I need to deal with this fallout on my own. I\u2019ve tried to talk to AJ, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a great listener, but she doesn\u2019t have a frame of reference for that sort of stuff.</p> <p>The only relationship she\u2019s ever been in is with Cord.\u201d She sighed. \u201cMacie and Channing are cool and I love them to death, but they\u2019re pregnant, hormonal, and I don\u2019t want them blabbing to my brothers because they\u2019d round up a damn posse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t got tons of experience when it comes to relationships, but you wanna tell me what went down?\u201d Chassie offered.</p><p>Keely stood and ducked into the extra closet her father converted into a half-bathroom during Keely\u2019s teen years. She returned with two Dixie cups and poured a generous slug of rum in each. She handed a cup to Chassie. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a couple three guys on a string at any given time. Never made any promises, I just wanna have a good time while I\u2019m still young and can.\u201d</p><p>That attitude sounded exactly like Keely\u2019s brothers\u2019.</p><p>\u201cAfter I met Justin, I thought I\u2019d try an actual relationship. We clicked on so many levels and the sex was spectacular. By Christmas I was convinced he was the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he feel the same way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought so. Remember I went home with him for a couple days during Christmas break?\u201d Chassie nodded. \u201cHis mother is awesome. So\u2019s his dad. However, Justin\u2019s brother Jack is the biggest fuckhead I\u2019ve ever met. Jesus. I can\u2019t believe Carter is such good friends with him.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, New Year\u2019s Eve we planned to go out with Justin\u2019s best friend Logan and Logan\u2019s girlfriend, Tiffany. We\u2019d rented a suite in downtown Denver, the whole shebang.</p><p>Long story short: Tiffany threw a hissy fit and ditched us. Justin didn\u2019t want Logan to spend New Year\u2019s alone so we headed back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Justin and Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Keely drained the contents of her glass and refilled it. \u201cWe\u2019re having a good time, drinking, bullshitting, listening to music, the usual. Logan tossed off some comment about how he and Justin both would be kissing me at midnight. I said something like</p><p>\u2018why wait\u2019 and the next thing I knew, Logan and I were kissing. Full body, with him-on-top-of-me type of kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin didn\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. In fact he was really into seeing me get it on with his best friend.\u201d</p> <p>Chassie swallowed hard at the conversational direction. \u201cWere you into it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith two hot, horny cowboys eatin\u2019 me up like I was fulfilling their ultimate fantasy? Hell yes. It was a raunchy, wild night of pure sexual debauchery. The next morning we laughed and teased each other like normal. I thought everything was fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first it was. The next day Justin went skiing with Jack-off. Then he went back on the road and didn\u2019t return to Colorado until the Denver Stock Show. When I saw him in person I knew something was up. He admitted he\u2019d had fun in the threesome with his buddy, but afterward he realized I was not the type of girl guys like him married. I was too free, too easy, great for wild sex but nothin\u2019 more. It stunned me because I\u2019d never pegged Justin as that type of judgmental guy.</p><p>\u201cI suspected he\u2019d told Jack-off the down and dirty details about our private New Year\u2019s bash. And Jack-off, being the self-serving, self-righteous prick, convinced him to break up with me. Initially I was so livid I thought about tracking Jack-off down in Chicago to rip him a new one. But as a couple days passed, I put the blame back where it belonged.\u201d</p><p>Please don\u2019t say on yourself, Keely. Please don\u2019t say it.</p><p>\u201cJustin is to blame. His hang-ups aren\u2019t my issue. I\u2019m comfortable with who I am.\u201d</p><p>Chassie exhaled with relief.</p><p>\u201cMaybe his repressed brother filled his head with bullshit, but Justin entertained enough doubts about me to let his opinion be swayed. Hard as it was to swallow, I realized I don\u2019t wanna be involved with a man who doesn\u2019t know his own mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart.\u201d She studied Keely\u2019s face. \u201cSo have you been mopin\u2019 around over Justin like a lovesick calf?\u201d</p><p>Keely grinned. \u201cHell no. I\u2019ve been dating Logan.\u201d</p><p>Chassie laughed, then clapped her hand over her mouth. \u201cSorry. For a minute there, I forgot why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Keely poured more rum in Chassie\u2019s cup. \u201cEnough about me. I wanna hear all about you and that hot-as-sin husband of yours. How are things going after a year of wedded bliss?\u201d</p><p>Chassie tipped the cup, watching the thick liquid stick to the waxy sides as she pondered her answer. \u201cHonestly? It\u2019s kind of...confusing right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cryptic, Chass. What gives?\u201d</p><p>Where should she start? When Edgard sauntered up the driveway? When she caught her husband kissing another man? After she watched them having sex? After all three of them started fucking on a regular basis? \u201cTrevor\u2019s dad had a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, neither did he. No one in his family told him until a week after it happened.\u201d</p><p>Keely whistled. \u201cDouble shit. Must seem like everyone is keeping family stuff from you guys. Is Trevor\u2019s dad okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d she hedged. \u201cTrevor\u2019s checked in a couple of times, but he\u2019s really distracted when he calls. I don\u2019t want to press him. He\u2019ll tell me when he comes home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing everything at the ranch by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have help. Good help, as it turns out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor\u2019s former ropin\u2019 partner. Edgard Mancuso. Know him?\u201d</p><p>Chassie heard the expression \u201cbug-eyed\u201d but she\u2019d never seen it on a person until Keely.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit. Know him? I\u2019ve lusted after him almost as long as I have Trevor. Edgard Mancuso. The hot Brazilian? Dark hair and golden eyes? With the ripped body, luminous smile and slow, sexy accent? Knows how to rope and ride like nobody\u2019s business? That Edgard Mancuso?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gets better.\u201d Chassie knocked back the booze in her cup. \u201cI\u2019m sleepin\u2019 with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d</p><p>Two goggle-eyed expressions from the usually unflappable Keely in one day. Not bad. \u201cYou heard me. I\u2019m sleepin\u2019 with him. And Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOmigod. Every detail. Right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis stays between us, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdgard showed up out of the blue. He and Trev hadn\u2019t seen each other since Colby\u2019s accident in Cheyenne. Since they\u2019d been partners for years things just clicked back into place easily\u201d\u2014 liar liar\u2014\u201cand Ed started helpin\u2019 out. Found out some bad things happened to him in Brazil and he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s ever goin\u2019 back. So he\u2019s stayin\u2019 with us indefinitely. Which is cool, \u2019cause I really like him and he and I hit it off like gangbusters.\u201d</p><p>Keely said slyly, \u201cMaybe you mean, you hit it off during a gang bang.\u201d</p><p>Chassie stuck her tongue out at her cousin. \u201cFunny, anyway, one night they\u2019re talkin\u2019 about all the crazy sex stuff they did on the road and it was the perfect opportunity to experience the raunchy threesome stuff I\u2019d been curious about. So I propositioned them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChassie West Glanzer...I\u2019m impressed!\u201d</p><p>She allowed a small smirk. \u201cTrevor is way into it, Edgard is way into it and I\u2019m in heaven, to put it mildly. I\u2019ve indulged in some of the hottest sex of my life and that\u2019s sayin\u2019 something with sex-god Trevor Glanzer as my husband.\u201d</p><p>Keely frowned. \u201cI sense a \u2018but\u2019 coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want it to be temporary, K. It might seem bizarre, but I want Trevor and Edgard in my bed and in my life for the long haul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what they want too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But it\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Keely countered. \u201cHow you live your life is your business, Chass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you forget we\u2019re livin\u2019 that life in Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worried what people will say down at the feed store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little. It\u2019s definitely not the norm.\u201d Chassie couldn\u2019t tell Keely how much out of the norm the situation really was.</p><p>A thoughtful expression crossed Keely\u2019s face. \u201cRemember old man Jacobs? He and his wife owned a place up by the reservation? Sold veggies and dried herbs?\u201d</p><p>Chassie nodded.</p><p>\u201cApparently Jacobs\u2019 brother\u2019s wife moved in with them after the brother died in some war and they\u2019d lived together for forty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, did it ever cross your mind something hinky might\u2019ve been going on with three people living together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A strange feeling\u2014hope? began to take root.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. No one thought anything of it. Maybe the old man screwed his sister-in-law and his wife every night and twice on Sundays. Maybe the two women were rug munchers and he was a cover. Maybe they didn\u2019t have sex ever and preferred to play pinochle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEww.

I\u2019ll bet you dollars to donuts once it\u2019s common knowledge that Edgard\u2019s moved in with you guys, everyone will think it\u2019s great Trevor\u2019s good buddy is there as a live-in ranch hand. The three of you will become entrenched in the minds of the community as a package deal. Honestly, Chass, no one will ever be the wiser that you are the middle of a Trevor and Edgard sandwich every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept I sorta hinted to that bratty Brandy Martinson we were havin\u2019 threesomes before any of this came to pass.

Be nice not to be a McKay for a change.\u201d Keely squeezed Chassie\u2019s hand. \u201cThere is no such thing as \u2018normal\u2019 even in Wyoming. You create your own family. Do what makes you, Trevor and Edgard happy in your own home. Besides, my mother always says the most meaningful relationships are those that don\u2019t have a public face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWise woman, your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if Cam was here he\u2019d command you to follow your bliss, say \u2018fuck you\u2019 to the world, and let the chips fall where they may.\u201d Keely smiled wistfully. \u201cGrab happiness whenever and wherever you can, Chass, \u2019cause you know how fleeting it is. It can be gone before you know it or ever get a chance to enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p>The cordless receiver on Keely\u2019s desk rang and she grabbed it, spinning it around to check the caller ID. The blood drained from her face.</p><p>Chassie\u2019s stomach dropped as if she\u2019d swallowed a stone. \u201cKeely. What\u2019s wrong?</p><p>Who is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cU.S. Government. Unlisted. Oh sweet Jesus.\u201d She raced out of the room and banged on Colt\u2019s door, yelling, \u201cColt, now,\u201d and Keely\u2019s footsteps thumped down the stairs, followed by her brother\u2019s.</p><p>Fifteen minutes passed. Didn\u2019t bode well that Keely hadn\u2019t burst back with the good news everything was all right. Chassie forced herself to go downstairs.</p><p>In the living room Colt stared out the window, his hands jammed in his back pockets.</p> <p>Carolyn sagged into the couch, crying silently as she stroked Keely\u2019s hair. Keely sat on the floor with her head in her mother\u2019s lap, arms wrapped around her mother\u2019s calves.</p><p>Her eyes were closed through the tears falling to the floor.</p><p>Carson\u2019s voice drifted from the dining room. Chassie leaned against the wall, waiting for the right moment to ask what\u2019d happened. Her heart ached. God. She wished Trevor and Edgard were with her.</p><p>Colt swore and turned around. When he noticed Chassie, he shot a questioning look at his mother, and she slowly nodded at him. \u201cThey found Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh thank God. Is he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s...fu\u2014screwed up. Bad. Seriously bad. Cam had surgery two days ago, right after they found him, barely alive. Somehow the army misplaced our number and were just now able to let us know what\u2019s goin\u2019 on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurgery? For what?\u201d</p><p>Colt swore again and balled his hands into fists at his sides. His jaw was clenched so tightly Chassie didn\u2019t know whether he\u2019d be able to speak.</p> <p>\u201cSurgery to amputate his mangled left leg. They cut it off below the knee. Evidently he lost the pinky finger on his left hand. He suffered from shrapnel wounds over the lower half of his body, burns to his chest and something...with his face, I didn\u2019t catch all of that part. Far as the doctors could tell, he\u2019d sustained no brain damage in the week he was MIA. Luckily none of his internal organs were hit.\u201d</p><p>She was as dismayed as she was relieved. At least he was alive. \u201cAre they sendin\u2019 him home?\u201d</p><p>Colt nodded. \u201cAs soon as he\u2019s stable they\u2019re transporting him to Walter Reed. He\u2019ll be there for some time before he\u2019s discharged. They don\u2019t know when.\u201d</p><p>Carson slipped back into the room and dropped next to Carolyn on the sofa. He put his big hand on Keely\u2019s head and stroked her hair. \u201cCarter sends his love. He can\u2019t come home with Macie set to go any time...\u201d</p><p>Carolyn patted his thigh. \u201cDid you tell him it\u2019s all right to stay there and focus on his wife? And Thane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Cord and AJ are on their way over. Same for Colby and Channing. And the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, sugar\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call Cal and Kimi?\u201d Carolyn interrupted. \u201cOr your other brothers? What about Kade? Kane?\u201d</p><p>Chassie wondered if they\u2019d remember to call the West side of the family, but chose not to point it out.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Colt said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it. It\u2019ll give me something to do besides think about gettin\u2019 drunk.\u201d</p><p>As much as Chassie wanted to go home to hear what\u2019d happened with Trevor and his family, she knew she\u2019d stay with the McKays. Someone needed to fix meals, wash dishes and watch Gib and Ky so the adults could talk without distractions or interruptions.</p><p>Chassie said, \u201cI\u2019ll see about fixin\u2019 some lunch,\u201d and disappeared into the kitchen to call home so Edgard knew not to expect her.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>Trevor was halfway home when Chassie called and told him about Cam McKay. Her subdued tone and distraction was a sign for him not to tell her what\u2019d gone down with his family. He owed her a full explanation, face-to-face, not another half-assed deflection of intent. Not another bald-faced lie.</p><p>It\u2019d been a shitty test to see how she\u2019d react to moving to the Glanzer ranch. Making her think he was considering it, even when he hadn\u2019t been. Because Trevor had passed his own test, and finally understood how perfect his life was. He\u2019d married a wonderful woman he loved with his whole heart. He was able to spend his daytime hours outside working land he owned and loved. He finally acknowledged that he could fill the empty part he\u2019d resigned to remaining empty. The part of him that\u2019d belonged to Edgard; the part of him that\u2019d always loved Edgard.</p><p>Even as the words repeated in his head he felt foolish. Loving another man. But he did. What Trevor felt for Edgard went beyond simple lust and sexual experimentation.</p><p>Friendship, companionship, shared interests, rockin\u2019 sex\u2014exactly what he and Chassie shared, which near as he could figure, was love.</p><p>Could Edgard live with Trevor\u2019s affection only in private? Could Chassie deal with sharing Trevor with Edgard? Could Trevor handle both Chassie and Edgard\u2019s demands?</p><p>Could he let a relationship develop between them without jealousy?</p><p>Most importantly, could he convince Edgard that it didn\u2019t matter if people outside their household knew they loved each other, just as long as they knew? It wasn\u2019t hiding the truth. It wasn\u2019t giving into outdated societal morals. What passed between the three of them was private. Not boasting near and far about their sexual preferences and dynamics wasn\u2019t unusual, it was normal.</p><p>Let it go. Your brain is fixin\u2019 to explode.</p><p>Soon as Chassie came home they\u2019d address the questions and concerns reasonably, like rational adults, because he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d let Edgard walk out of his life again.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s pickup was parked by the barn. The woodpile had been split and stacked.</p><p>The driveway cleared after a day\u2019s worth of snow. A light shone in the kitchen. Smoke curled against the purplish twilight sky, making the little farmhouse tucked among the trees postcard worthy.</p><p>He grabbed his duffel and headed inside, wondering what Edgard was doing after the last cattle check, wishing Chassie was here to meet him. Trevor hung up his coat and shed his boots, and noticed Edgard in the kitchen waiting for him instead. Automatically his heart lightened a bit.</p><p>\u201cHey. How were the roads?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cNo problems except outside of Lusk. But even that wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d Trevor rubbed his cold hands together. \u201cHear anything else from Chassie?\u201d</p><p>Edgard shook his head. \u201cNothin\u2019 new. Damn shame about that McKay brother.</p><p>Gonna be rough on the whole family. I\u2019d say he\u2019s lucky to be alive, but that sounds a little hollow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d Trevor tamped down his nerves and moved in front of Edgard, setting his hands on Edgard\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Before the wariness in Edgard\u2019s eyes scared him off completely, Trevor jerked the man into a full body hug. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>Edgard read Trevor\u2019s underlying meaning. Trevor hadn\u2019t meant missing him for the last day, but for the last three and a half years. Edgard returned the embrace with a murmured, \u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>They were content to hold each other for a good long while, just because they could.</p><p>Trevor pulled back and cupped Edgard\u2019s face\u2014that beautiful, familiar, smiling face.</p><p>He gloried in the pleasure shining in those topaz eyes. \u201cAh hell, Ed\u201d\u2014he cleared his throat\u2014\u201cI love you. I ain\u2019t ever said it to you, but that don\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t feel it then or now.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s long pause seemed to steal every bit of wind from Trevor\u2019s sails. Until that magnificent smile appeared. \u201cI could be a total dick and say it\u2019s about fuckin\u2019 time, but I won\u2019t. I\u2019ve changed too. I realize we\u2019re both in a different place than we were years ago.</p><p>I\u2019ll confess I like hearing it now, meu amore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you would.\u201d Trevor bent his head, letting their breath mingle but never breaking eye contact. \u201cI ain\u2019t ever gonna be ashamed of admittin\u2019 it to you. I don\u2019t care what anyone else thinks. I care what you think. Can you live with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, especially after living without it.\u201d</p><p>Trevor let his mouth deliver on the promise with an extensive, lazy, wet kiss. A full-body kiss, pelvis grinding on pelvis, cocks perfectly aligned. They were breathing hard when they broke apart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Edgard tasted Trevor\u2019s bottom lip with a measured sweep of his tongue. \u201cI want you.</p><p>Now. I don\u2019t care where, but it needs to be now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn right.\u201d Trevor\u2019s hands flew to Edgard\u2019s belt. Buckle undone, button undone, zipper undone, Trevor was damn near undone wanting to get his hands and mouth all over this man\u2019s tempting body. He sank to his knees as he tugged Edgard\u2019s jeans down his corded thighs and off, on to the floor. \u201cLeast you ain\u2019t wearin\u2019 boots,\u201d he said, rubbing his cheek against the hot, hard length and inhaling Edgard\u2019s unique scent.</p><p>\u201cTrevor, this isn\u2019t what I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He eased back. \u201cYou got a problem with me suckin\u2019 you off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen shut the fuck up.\u201d Trevor wrapped his hand around the base of Edgard\u2019s cock and stroked as his mouth went to work on the wet tip. He sucked, saturating his tongue with Ed\u2019s flavor, bathing that throbbing organ with his saliva. On every downstroke, his mouth went a little further.</p><p>Hands grasped his hair, forcing him deeper.</p><p>With the plump cockhead resting on his lips, Trevor warned, \u201cYour hands better be grippin\u2019 the counter. Don\u2019t make me tell you twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. All right.\u201d</p><p>He watched as Edgard\u2019s palms clamped around the counter\u2019s edge. \u201cMove your legs apart.\u201d Trevor\u2019s dick pressed painfully against his fly and he shifted his stance. His lips parted to take every hot inch of that rigid cock. Greedily. Hungrily. Using his teeth to tease. Flicking his tongue over the sweet spot below the purplish crown.</p><p>Edgard groaned. \u201cI love that, but oh man, I love it when you suck my balls.\u201d</p><p>Keeping Edgard\u2019s prick buried in his mouth, Trevor reached between Edgard\u2019s widespread thighs to fondle the tight sac. He rolled the balls over his fingertips, letting the saliva run down his chin to coat those tight, furry globes.</p><p>\u201cSweet mother of God.\u201d</p><p>Trevor released the shaft and held it aside, still jacking Edgard off, opening wide to suck both balls into his mouth.</p><p>Another enthusiastic moan rumbled from Edgard\u2019s chest.</p><p>He sucked on the taut globes, loving the pearls of pre-come sliding down Edgard\u2019s cock and dripping on his face. The wet balls slipped free from his mouth and he used his tongue to trace the thick, pulsing root back to that tempting pucker.</p><p>\u201cFuck. More. Please. Please.\u201d</p><p>Tickling the velvety hole proved difficult given the position of his head. Trevor licked as far back as he could, knowing the teasing sweep of wetness over the sensitive knot of nerves drove Edgard insane. \u201cCan\u2019t reach. My tongue ain\u2019t long enough at this angle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChassie\u2019s is,\u201d Edgard murmured. \u201cThat\u2019s something new we\u2019ll have to teach her.\u201d</p><p>Trevor purred his agreement, half-surprised how natural it was talking about teaching his wife new sex tricks while satisfying his male lover. He lapped and licked, sweeping his tongue over the drops leaking from the slit in the head.</p><p>\u201cFinish me,\u201d Edgard half-pleaded. His hands plowed through Trevor\u2019s hair and he plunged into Trevor\u2019s mouth with a growl. Back out. In. Out. In. Out. Without pause, an animalistic rhythm.</p> <p>Trevor loved to make the man lose control. Absolutely fucking loved it.</p><p>\u201cSuck harder. Christ, like that.\u201d</p><p>He dug his fingers into the tops of Edgard\u2019s solid thighs as those lean hips hammered into his face with absolute abandon.</p><p>Edgard rammed his dick to the hilt. Each stroke stretched Trevor\u2019s mouth wider, each stroke became harder, harsher, taking Ed to the point of detonation. Edgard slapped his hands on Trevor\u2019s cheeks, holding his face as he came with a hoarse shout.</p><p>Satisfaction surged as Edgard poured his salty, bitter heat down the back of Trevor\u2019s throat. When Edgard neared the end of his orgasm, Trevor let the shaft slip from his mouth until his teeth circled the flared rim of the crown. He focused on the cockhead, feeling the thick vein running on the underside of Edgard\u2019s dick still twitching beneath Trevor\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn.\u201d Edgard grunted and kept coming.</p><p>He kept right on tonguing him until he had nothing left.</p><p>Spent, Edgard released his grip on Trevor\u2019s hair. Acting somewhat weak-kneed, he braced one hand behind him on the counter ledge and lovingly caressed the contours of Trevor\u2019s cheek and jaw with his other hand. \u201cTrev. I\u2014don\u2019t...damn.\u201d</p><p>One last suckle of that still half-hard cock, one last nuzzle of the damp hair coated with Edgard\u2019s musk and Trevor eased off. He scrambled to his feet. \u201cGood. Because my dick is about to explode and I want it buried balls deep in your ass when it happens.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting Trevor grabbed Edgard\u2019s hand and led him upstairs to the bedroom he shared with Chassie. The sheets were rumpled. The quilt dangled off the end of the bed and a twinge of guilt surfaced.</p><p>Edgard sensed it. Wrapping his arms around Trevor\u2019s waist, he nestled his chin in the curve of Trevor\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI didn\u2019t make up the bed after Chassie left this morning.\u201d</p><p>He nipped Trevor\u2019s earlobe.</p><p>Electric tingles shot down Trevor\u2019s arm and distorted his already ragged breathing.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019ll make you feel less guilty about you and me bein\u2019 together, Chassie and I made love in that bed last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet and hot, but we missed you.\u201d</p><p>Trevor was actually turned on by the idea of watching Edgard and Chassie fucking alone\u2014with him jacking off and then joining in for round two.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Chassie will be hungry for details of our hot monkey sex when she comes home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019d better not disappoint her.\u201d</p><p>Shirts were stripped away. Same for T-shirts. Trevor\u2019s jeans, underwear and socks.</p><p>They faced each other. Reached for each other. Matched chest-to-chest, cock-to-cock, mouth-to-mouth. Even as Edgard tried to seduce him with teasing kisses, Trevor was strung tight, crazy for release.</p><p>Again, Edgard was tuned in to his signals. \u201cGet on the bed. Let me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna blowjob. I wanna fuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue. Do it.\u201d</p><p>Trevor crawled on the bed on his hands and knees. Just as he was about to roll over, Edgard\u2019s hands were on his ass, spreading his butt cheeks apart. Then a hot, wet tongue traced his crack.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d He stretched his arms above his head and pressed the side of his face to the mattress. The sheets smelled like Chassie. Like Edgard. Like them. Trevor breathed the enthralling scent deep into his lungs.</p><p>Light tongue flicks tantalized his hole, followed by hard-lipped nibbles and soft sucking.</p><p>Edgard was an expert at anal play and held nothing back. \u201cI am such a slut for that.</p><p>Been so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I love to do it.\u201d Another wet flicker of his tongue over the pucker. \u201cThis whips you into that wheezing-whimpering-impatient-to-fuck state.\u201d Edgard pierced his ass with one deep jab. He lapped at Trevor\u2019s hole, teasing, and then plunging that wicked tongue deep again.</p><p>Trevor clutched handfuls of the sheet, bumping his hips back to meet every searching thrust. Pressure built in his balls and he desperately wanted to come. And not to come.</p><p>Edgard knew when to back off. He rubbed his jaw over Trevor\u2019s cheeks and scattered kisses up the line of Trevor\u2019s spine. A gentle scrape of teeth on his shoulder blades set Trevor\u2019s body quaking. Hot breath in his ear. \u201cNext time I\u2019m gonna make you come like that. Right now, get the lube.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you look good all stretched out on my bed,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t such a hardship yourself.\u201d Trevor\u2019s muscle-bound body always fascinated Edgard. The pale blond hair on Trevor\u2019s brawny forearms was softer than the coarse hair covering his long legs. Yet, his upper torso was nearly hairless, with the exception of the golden trail leading to his crotch. Abs of steel, a result of Trevor\u2019s insistence on three hundred core-strengthening crunches every morning\u2014evidently a habit he\u2019d maintained after he\u2019d left the circuit. Old white scars stood out on his bronze skin like badges of honor or of shame. Freckles ranging in color from cinnamon to gold were scattered across his broad shoulders and down his broad back as testament to the sheer amount of hours Trevor spent in the sun.</p><p>The click of the cap of lubricant drew Edgard\u2019s attention to Trevor\u2019s face. He squirted gel on his palm and fisted his cock. Then he ran a line of gel down the seam of his index and middle fingers as he moved between Edgard\u2019s legs.</p><p>Edgard pulled his knees back, exposing his entrance for Trevor\u2019s pleasure. His cock had gone rigid with arousal again and slapped against his belly.</p><p>\u201cNo foreplay. I want you so bad it hurts.\u201d Trevor rubbed the cool gel on Edgard\u2019s hole and pushed one finger in, and pumped it in and out a few times before wiggling the second one in beside it.</p><p>As much as Edgard craved Trevor\u2019s tongue licking his nipples, it was a serious turn on witnessing the vein below Trevor\u2019s jawbone pop as his fingers repeatedly breached Edgard\u2019s body. His sharp cheekbones were flushed with arousal. His lips\u2014oh man, those pouty lips he\u2019d dreamed about\u2014were plumped and red from sucking Edgar\u2019s cock. He was beautiful. Trevor was everything. Not a passing fancy, not an unattainable dream, but the man Edgard wanted to spend his life with.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready, wanna feel you in me.\u201d Edgard reached for Trevor, looping his arms around Trevor\u2019s neck.</p><p>Trevor nailed Edgard\u2019s gland a couple times and grinned when Edgard moaned, arching into his intimate touch. \u201cJesus you\u2019re tight. Think you can take me hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you any way I can get you.\u201d</p><p>Then the fingers disappeared and Trevor levered his body over Edgard\u2019s. The thick head of Trevor\u2019s cock brushed Edgard\u2019s hole once before Trevor plowed in to the hilt.</p><p>Edgard hissed.</p><p>\u201cAh fuck.\u201d Trevor lowered his face against Edgard\u2019s neck. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna last. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blowin\u2019 you and then the way you used that talented tongue has done me in, Ed.\u201d He withdrew fully and plunged in, setting a rhythm that made it impossible to maintain a kiss.</p><p>Instead, Edgard settled for sucking the tendons in Trevor\u2019s neck while pinching his pebbled nipples. Trevor grunted his approval and slammed into Edgard harder.</p><p>\u201cNext time I\u2019m gonna take my time touchin\u2019 you and lovin\u2019 on you.\u201d He gritted his teeth, looking down to watch his thick cock tunneling in and out of Edgard\u2019s ass.</p><p>Feeling the slickness on his stomach from his own cock, tasting the sweat running down Trevor\u2019s straining throat made Edgard\u2019s blood pump hotter. Witnessing the ecstasy on Trevor\u2019s face had Edgard clamping down with his anal muscles every time Trevor\u2019s pistoning cock filled his ass. \u201cCome on, Trev. Don\u2019t hold back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. Not ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t gonna break me.\u201d</p><p>Trevor growled. \u201cChrist, I love fucking you.\u201d His palms landed on Edgard\u2019s kneecaps and he pushed Edgard flat as he let loose with all the raw power his body could offer. \u201cFucking.\u201d Thrust. \u201cLove.\u201d Thrust. \u201cYou.\u201d Thrust. Trevor tipped his head back; a moan burst from his mouth and his lips went slack. His eyes squeezed shut as his orgasm hit and he grunted and pounded harder, coating Edgard\u2019s channel with jets of his hot come.</p><p>It was too much. Edgard took himself in hand, beating off until he shot his load all over his belly, biting his lip to keep from crying out his pleasure as Trevor took his.</p><p>Broken breaths filled the humid, sex-scented air.</p><p>Soon as Trevor opened his pretty eyes, Edgard urged him forward. His mouth teased across Trevor\u2019s until his moist lips parted. Edgard swallowed his sweet breath, and his sweet words, indulging them both in a drawn-out, tongue-tangling kiss.</p><p>\u201cI missed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just everything about you. Goddamn, my memories don\u2019t come close to the reality of bein\u2019 with you. Not even fuckin\u2019 close.\u201d Trevor nuzzled Edgard\u2019s jaw, pressing wet kisses down the slope to his chin.</p><p>\u201cSame goes. I could get used to this sweet talkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? You always wanted them sappy kind of love words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they have more impact now, Trev, because you actually mean them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I do. So, what we doin\u2019 for our next monkey sex trick? I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 of a repeat of the one we did in Tulsa after we won first place, where you\u2019re layin\u2019 on your back, kinda spread-eagled. And I\u2019m sittin\u2019 on top of you, reverse cowgirl style as I\u2019m bouncin\u2019 on your pole.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s cock twitched between them and Trevor laughed.</p><p>\u201cOr a little sixty-nine action?\u201d The very tip of Trevor\u2019s tongue outlined the rim of Edgard\u2019s ear. \u201cOr maybe just with my head hangin\u2019 off the end of the bed so you can redefine deep throatin\u2019...\u2019course, you\u2019d be suckin\u2019 on me too.\u201d</p><p>Edgard squirmed at the goose bumps racing down his arms.</p><p>\u201cOr\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we could talk.\u201d</p> <p>Trevor lifted his head. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have a confession to make.\u201d</p><p>Those pale blue eyes narrowed.</p><p>Just say it. Straight up. \u201cI love you, man. I\u2019ve always loved you. But it appears I\u2019m also falling for your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun that by me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m crazy about that woman who\u2019s crazy enough to love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. From the second I met her I knew she was different\u2014not the same shallow type of pretty, cheap, easy bimbos you preferred to bed in the past.\u201d</p><p>Trevor grunted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Chassie is pretty. She\u2019s sweet as pie. She\u2019s unassuming, yet there\u2019s no doubt she is borne of grit and a whole lotta try. Not to mention she\u2019s funny.</p><p>And I swear, she\u2019s as raunchy as any man I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreachin\u2019 to the choir here, Ed,\u201d he said testily.</p><p>He closed his eyes and bucked his hips. \u201cFine. Forget it. Get off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell no.\u201d Trevor made his weight feel heavier. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be in you and on you when you tell me you ain\u2019t pullin\u2019 my leg when you confess you\u2019ve got the hots for Chassie, amigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t joke, especially not about this.\u201d</p><p>A pause filled the air. \u201cHey,\u201d Trevor intoned softly, but with a gruff edge. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Edgard blinked his eyes open with surprise.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Trevor smooched Edgard\u2019s nose. \u201cIt just caught me off guard, okay? Ain\u2019t every day your best friend tells you he\u2019s got a thing for your wife. Go ahead and finish.</p><p>I\u2019ll keep my trap shut for a change.\u201d</p><p>Edgard inhaled and exhaled slowly, amazed by how much Trevor had changed. How glad he was the changes didn\u2019t come at the expense of everything else he\u2019d liked about Trevor. \u201cChassie and I hung out and worked side-by-side after I first arrived here, since you didn\u2019t want anything to do with me. I got to know her. I genuinely liked her as a person before I figured out she really did make you happy. After I kissed you and Chassie left, I felt bad, but not bad enough that I\u2019d\u2019ve given you up if she didn\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. When she returned and worked so hard at understanding our relationship, then wanted to be a part of it, I thought if I could have you occasionally, I\u2019d put up with being in bed with Chassie too.\u201d</p><p>Trevor just stared at him.</p><p>\u201cBut see, there is no put up with. And I\u2019ve been as freaked out about my attraction to her as I imagine you were when you figured out you were attracted to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it just sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so at first. Strictly on a sexual level I love touching her. Having her touch me. Watching you two together. Having her watching you and me. And the three of us in bed is beyond explosive.\u201d</p><p>A smile tilted the corners of Trevor\u2019s mouth. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a personal level...it might sound lame, but Chassie lets me soothe her and she soothes me in a way no one else ever has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even me?\u201d</p><p>Edgard shook his head. \u201cNot even my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. That\u2019s some serious shit, Ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. There\u2019s a softness about her that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with her female parts. The other night, when I told her everything that\u2019d gone on in my life, things I never told anyone, not even you, she broke down and cried for me. Cried. For me. No one\u2019s ever cried for me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. After you went back to Brazil.\u201d Trevor scowled. \u201cBut I was really cryin\u2019 for myself, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tough cowboy like you really shed a tear? For me?\u201d When Trevor ducked his head, Edgard forced it back up. \u201cI\u2019m glad you told me. There was a time when you wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimes change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. Anyway, the morning after the first night we were all together? She showed honest-to-God genuine sorrow that I\u2019d slept alone. The next night and every night after that she welcomed me. Not only into your bed, but...into her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat woman has a mighty big, mighty soft heart. I kid her that her breasts are so small because her heart is so dang big,\u201d Trevor added with a chuckle. \u201cLong as we\u2019re spillin\u2019 our guts... Lemme ask you something.\u201d</p><p>Threading his fingers through the damp hair at Trevor\u2019s temple, Edgard let his thumb caress the hollow of Trevor\u2019s cheek and the man practically purred. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Chassie would be so acceptin\u2019 about us if it wasn\u2019t for Dag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s eyes were serious. \u201cMe neither. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe watched her brother, the first man she loved, wither up inside and die because he couldn\u2019t be who he wanted to be or live his life on his own terms. She doesn\u2019t want that to happen to her or to you, or now, even to me. Not when she has the power to change it. Not in a crusading way, trying to right old wrongs, but in accepting things change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt goes deeper than rollin\u2019 with the punches, don\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m amazed that Chassie loves unconditionally, which is why she\u2019s at her aunt and uncle\u2019s place helping out even when she\u2019s mad as hell at the whole lot of \u2019em.</p><p>Even when she\u2019d rather be here with you, hearing what happened with your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s enough of her sweet goodness to go around, does there?\u201d</p><p>Trevor said.</p><p>\u201cNo. She just...\u201d Edgard stared at Trevor helplessly, hoping he\u2019d fill in the blanks.</p><p>\u201cI know, buddy. Chassie is like... it, ain\u2019t she? I discovered that the very first time we spent time together. Made me goddamn glad no other bozos around these parts figured it out before I snapped her up as mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That pint-sized woman brings out the best in everyone, even degenerates like us. Bein\u2019 with her has made me a better man. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m able to accept how I feel about you because she accepts it. Encourages it.\u201d Trevor kissed his forehead.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I knew you were a goner for Miz Sassy Chassie when you bought her that goddamn goat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChass was kinda putty in my hands after that, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d Edgard mused.</p><p>Trevor laughed. Hard. His whole body shook atop Edgard\u2019s. \u201cPutty. Right. She\u2019s steel, not putty. My advice? She\u2019s a helluva shot too, so don\u2019t piss her off.\u201d</p><p>The dead coyote flashed in his mind and Edgard shuddered.</p><p>Trevor pulled his softened cock out and took his time melting Edgard with his sweet and hot brand of kisses.</p><p>Edgard sighed with absolute contentment as Trevor hopped off the bed, gifting him with another glimpse of the hottest ass he\u2019d ever had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou wanna shower?</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Trevor grinned and pointed at the interest stirring in Edgard\u2019s cock. \u201cAfter we have another round of monkey sex, we\u2019ll talk more about all this. In detail. I wanna make it work this time, Ed. Don\u2019t know how we\u2019re gonna go about it, but I figure we can come up with something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you always bolted when I attempted to talk about anything serious before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think us both bein\u2019 here together like this is proof contrary to that statement, doncha think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I do. Know what else I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>Edgard wanted to tell him of the conversation he\u2019d had with Gus, but something made him hold off. He smiled cockily. \u201cI think you\u2019d better plan on checkin\u2019 cattle with the four-wheelers in the morning and grab the lube \u2019cause it\u2019s gonna be one long damn night.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>After Colby and Cord\u2019s families left, Carson convinced Carolyn to go to bed.</p><p>Chassie couldn\u2019t sleep. She paced in the guest bedroom, wondering what Trevor and Edgard were up to even when she knew exactly what they were doing: each other. Odd, she didn\u2019t feel so much jealous as curious.</p><p>Keely locked herself in her bedroom on the pretext of studying, but Chassie suspected Keely wouldn\u2019t crack a single textbook. Keely freely shared graphic details about her sex life, but when it came to talking about her feelings she was as closed-mouthed as her brothers, maybe worse.</p><p>Chassie meandered downstairs into the dark kitchen. She poured a mug of milk and heated it up in the microwave. When she noticed the small lamp glowing from Aunt Carolyn\u2019s sitting room, she went to turn it off and saw Colt standing in front of the big windows, staring out into the darkness.</p><p>He said, \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep either, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Colt glanced over his shoulder at her and the mug in her hand. He smiled slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou still drinkin\u2019 warm milk at night?\u201d</p><p>Chassie froze. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDag. He told me he never understood how you preferred milk to whiskey, even when you were older and had the choice. Said he used to get up with you sometimes.</p><p>That way if Uncle Harland heard noise he\u2019d put the smackdown on Dag, not you.\u201d</p><p>A lump lodged in Chassie\u2019s throat, remembering those nights she couldn\u2019t sleep and she\u2019d tiptoe downstairs. Usually Dag would follow, grumbling she\u2019d made enough noise to wake the dead. They\u2019d sit in the sun porch\u2014winter or summer\u2014talking until she finished her \u201cgood girl toddy\u201d or until Dag admonished her for being chatty as a magpie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised Dag told you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDag told me a lot of things. Might sound sappy as shit, Chass, but he loved you.</p><p>Probably had a piss-poor way of showin\u2019 it, but he thought you were the greatest. He always wanted more for you than he wanted for himself. That\u2019s what made him such a great guy, in my mind anyway.\u201d Colt faced the windows again.</p><p>Tears filled her eyes and splashed into her cup. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if he cared about me, especially the last couple years. He was always so angry and bitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, there\u2019s quite a bit you didn\u2019t know about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots I did know about him that he wouldn\u2019t admit. Or more importantly, he didn\u2019t have the guts to face up to. With me or anyone else.\u201d</p><p>That comment caught Colt off-guard and he whirled around, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we really gonna tiptoe around the subject, Colt? Dag\u2019s dead and we can\u2019t even talk about this?\u201d</p><p>Colt didn\u2019t utter a sound.</p><p>\u201cI knew Dag was gay. Or bi. Or whatever. Did you?\u201d</p><p>After a healthy pause, he nodded. \u201cNot because he told me, because I stumbled across him and another guy at the Boars Nest. Not my thing but I didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass if it was his. I told him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he believe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve told him the same thing if given the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDag thought it was the booze talkin\u2019 when I tried to convince him no one would care who he fucked behind closed doors. Hell, that philosophy holds true for everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone except my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for him. And without soundin\u2019 like a prick I hope those fool-headed ideas died right along with him.\u201d Colt cocked his head with a quizzical look. \u201cUncle Harland would\u2019ve freaked about Dag. Disowned him and all that shit, right?\u201d</p><p>Talking about her dad always made Chassie uncomfortable. \u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the shitstorm would\u2019ve come down on you. Dag knew how much you already did around your place. Plus you were stuck takin\u2019 care of your old man, barely scrapin\u2019 by. He felt guilty he couldn\u2019t contribute more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve been worse if Dag hadn\u2019t sent us cash from his rodeo earnin\u2019s when he was on the circuit. It woulda pissed Daddy off if he knew, so I hid it in a separate account and he didn\u2019t find out.\u201d She shook her head. \u201c\u2019Course, there\u2019s none left now. Trevor and I used it to bulk up the herd last spring when the cattle prices were low. Doubled the size of the herd for about half of what it\u2019d normally cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart. You\u2019ve always had a sharp eye when it comes to livestock.\u201d</p><p>Chassie appreciated the compliment. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where\u2019d you end up grazin\u2019 all them extras?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge,\u201d she admitted. \u201cWe had grazin\u2019 rights to Forest Service land that we hadn\u2019t used for a couple of years because the amount of cattle we were runnin\u2019 decreased dramatically. Then we moved the bulls in with Junior Anderson\u2019s for the summer. No doubt we need more space or we\u2019re gonna hafta cut back and sell some off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard the rumors that Gus Dutton is lookin\u2019 to sell his place?\u201d Colt asked.</p><p>Chassie thought about lying but in the scheme of things the McKays would end up with the land anyway. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny truth to \u2019em?\u201d</p><p>Chassie measured him. Coolly. Honestly. Since Colt sobered up, he\u2019d shed twenty pounds. His handsome face was sharp angles again. No beer gut or flab distorted his sturdy frame. If anything he\u2019d bulked up, adding more muscle to his arms and chest. His eyes weren\u2019t bloodshot, but they held a wary edge. Not only was Colt the most resourceful of her McKay cousins, he\u2019d always been the best looking\u2014and that was saying something. Colt\u2019s cowboy charm also knew no bounds, so Colt\u2019s bad attitude had been the worst part of his slide into alcoholism. He\u2019d turned mean, cynical, nasty to his family. Just like Dag. But unlike Dag, he\u2019d overcome his demons.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna keep gawkin\u2019 at me, or you gonna answer the question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I...just noticed sobriety agrees with you, Colt. You look great.\u201d</p><p>Colt frowned. \u201cUh. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Gus is sellin\u2019. He approached us first since he knew Trevor and I were lookin\u2019 to expand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat chunk of land borders ours on our southwest end.\u201d</p><p>Chassie twisted her index finger around the cup handle. \u201cI know. Which is why he\u2019ll be contacting the McKays to see if you all are interested in addin\u2019 to your spread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Colt\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cDon\u2019t you want it? That place\u2019d be perfect to expand into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well. I-I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop stuttering and shut your mouth. Our family business ain\u2019t none of the McKays\u2019 business.\u201d</p><p>Lousy time for her dad\u2019s voice to interject an opinion. Chassie tried for nonchalance.</p><p>\u201cBecause we can\u2019t afford it. Hardly enough cash on hand for operating expenses, say nothin\u2019 of layin\u2019 out a chunk of change for more. We talked to the banker and he agreed to a loan if we came up with cash collateral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho you dealin\u2019 with at the bank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlim Jim Beal. He\u2019s been more than fair, but we can\u2019t come up with the ten percent down payment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat dollar amount did you agree on with Gus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuarter of a million.\u201d It hurt her stomach to even say a number that big.</p><p>Colt\u2019s eyes became accusatory. \u201cYou say anything about this to my dad?\u201d</p><p>Chassie shook her head.</p><p>\u201cCord? Colby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I probably should\u2019ve tonight when I had the chance. Right now, the twenty-five grand we need is as hard to come by as the two hundred thousand. We\u2019re just sick about it, but ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 we can do.\u201d Mortified by her admission, Chassie drained her milk.</p><p>\u201cThanks for keepin\u2019 me company. I\u2019m goin\u2019 to bed.\u201d</p><p>Colt merely stared at her and crossed his arms over his chest. The sleeve of his T-shirt lifted, revealing a brightly colored tattoo on his biceps.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019d you get that?\u201d She pointed at the tat.</p><p>He glanced down. \u201cLast year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the four horseman of the apocalypse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Colt rolled his sleeve to the top of his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. That\u2019s gorgeous. India did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s good, ain\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Chassie squinted at the flames that swirled around the horse\u2019s hooves. \u201cYep, although it don\u2019t seem like something you\u2019d pick, cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t.\u201d Colt grimaced. \u201cThis is what you get when you leave the choice in the hands of a smartass tattoo artist. Indy thought it\u2019d be hilarious tattooin\u2019 a horse on me when my name is Colt. That woman is seriously warped from havin\u2019 so many holes pierced in her head.\u201d His gruff attitude belied his oddly affectionate tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to have her design one for me one day when I can afford it. But you can be damn sure I ain\u2019t gonna let her tattoo a car chassis on me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colt rolled his sleeve back down. \u201cShe ain\u2019t that expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney\u2019s relative when you don\u2019t have any.\u201d She sighed. \u201cLook, I\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t say nothin\u2019 about me\u2019n Trevor havin\u2019 to pass on Gus\u2019s place. It\u2019s hard enough to know we\u2019re losin\u2019 out, and havin\u2019 the whole county gossiping about our financial troubles would just make it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Chass, I can keep my mouth shut and I\u2019d suggest you do the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMeanin\u2019 what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeepin\u2019 things to yourself is a damn fine way to get to keep the things you want to yourself, know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>No. She had no clue. Chassie half-wondered if he\u2019d overheard her conversation with Keely earlier this morning about having both Trevor and Edgard in her bed and in her life.</p><p>Colt did a curious thing. He leaned down and kissed the top of her head. \u201cSweet dreams, sweet little cuz. See you in the morning.\u201d Then Colt re-crossed his arms over his chest and turned back to the window, gazing into the night.</p><p>Feeling dismissed, Chassie crept back to her room, wondering how she could get to sleep without at least one warm body beside her.</p> <p>Chapter Thirty-one</p><p>Chassie left the McKays around nine the next morning. She\u2019d run a few errands for Aunt Carolyn, including driving to Moorcroft to talk to Kade and Skylar in person about Cam. Her cell phone died, which meant she hadn\u2019t spoken to Trevor for twenty-four hours. She missed her husband. She missed home. She missed Edgard. She missed her damn goat.</p><p>Her head throbbed, her heart hurt, her jaw was sore from clenching her teeth to keep from bawling. She was an emotional wreck when she considered the jumbled messes in her life: Trevor\u2019s status with his family, the situation with Edgard, losing out on Gus\u2019s land, and dealing with family tragedies. All Chassie wanted was to climb in bed for three solid days. She damn near wept when the old farmhouse came into view.</p><p>And tears did leak out when both her men ambled up to the truck right after she\u2019d parked.</p><p>\u201cMissed you, baby.\u201d Trevor pulled her into his arms and laid a big, wet kiss on her.</p><p>He frowned at her forehead. \u201cWhat the hell happened to your face?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knew I forgot to tell him something.\u201d Edgard gave Trevor the abbreviated version of the run-in with Greta, which didn\u2019t appease Trevor at all.</p><p>\u201cThat goddamn goat was a bad idea. We shoulda talked about buyin\u2019 it first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s always bitchin\u2019 about me talkin\u2019 stuff to death, Trev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is true,\u201d Edgard added.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Ed.\u201d Trevor traced the area around the bandage that looked a little worse for the wear. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yeah. I forgot my painkillers and antibiotics here because I didn\u2019t expect to be at the McKays\u2019 that long.\u201d Chassie nestled her face into Trevor\u2019s chest. \u201cI wanna shower and then I wanna crawl in bed.\u201d</p><p>Edgard grabbed her hand and rubbed his mouth over the inside of her wrist. \u201cMissed you. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re home and I won\u2019t let Trevor kill Greta. I\u2019ll make certain he treats her with kid gloves while you\u2019re resting up.\u201d</p><p>Trevor snorted.</p> <p>Tires crunched and a big white Dodge Dually crept up the driveway. It wasn\u2019t a vehicle Chassie recognized until she saw the big winch sticking out of the front. She muttered, \u201cShit,\u201d under her breath.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cColt McKay,\u201d Trevor answered. \u201cWhat the hell is he doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s not more bad news about Cam.\u201d</p><p>The truck bounced as Colt stepped off the chrome running board. He\u2019d taken to wearing ball caps rather than cowboy hats during the workday. Chassie thought Colt seemed more accessible, not a larger than life drop-dead gorgeous cowboy in his prime who hid his eyes and emotions under the brim of a big black hat.</p><p>Colt thrust out his hand to Edgard. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t the Brazilian. I heard you were around these parts. Nice seein\u2019 you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, Colt.\u201d</p><p>Edgard knew Colt? Then Chassie realized Edgard must\u2019ve met Colby\u2019s family members at various rodeo events in the years they traveled together.</p><p>After Colt shook Trevor\u2019s hand, he faced Ed again and asked, \u201cHow long you stayin\u2019, Edgard?\u201d</p><p>The moment of truth. A collective pause hung in the air as Chassie waited for someone\u2014anyone\u2014to answer.</p><p>Trevor clapped Edgard on the back. \u201cEd\u2019s decided to move here with us. Ain\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p>Relief so profound swept through Chassie she almost crumpled to the ground and wept.</p><p>\u201cSure is.\u201d Colt smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to seein\u2019 you around. I suppose with you partnerin\u2019 up with Trevor again there ain\u2019t a chance in hell that Kade and I will ever win the team ropin\u2019 championship at the Devil\u2019s Tower Rodeo, eh?\u201d</p><p>Edgard grinned back. \u201cYou can try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you can bank on.\u201d Colt turned to Chassie. \u201cThanks for comin\u2019 over yesterday.</p><p>I didn\u2019t get a chance to say thank you this mornin\u2019 with all the hullabaloo that\u2019s goin\u2019 on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. What\u2019s up? Something new with Cam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My folks are already workin\u2019 on gettin\u2019 Cam transferred to the VA hospital in Cheyenne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doin\u2019? Have you talked to him?\u201d</p><p>Colt frowned. \u201cNo. He ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 to nobody. Anyway, the good news is Macie had the baby about an hour ago. A boy named Parker. They\u2019re both fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you drove all the way out here to tell me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. No. Hell.\u201d He paused. \u201cThe other reason I\u2019m here is \u2019cause you left before I got to talk to you about something else.\u201d Alone was heavily implied.</p><p>Dammit, she didn\u2019t want to talk to Colt. She wanted to talk to Trevor and Edgard.</p><p>Trevor frowned. \u201cWill this take long? \u2019Cause Chassie\u2019s exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention she\u2019s injured and she needs to get some rest,\u201d Edgard said.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t take long at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back in about ten minutes, baby.\u201d The men headed to the machine shed.</p><p>\u201cTrevor\u2019s real protective of you, ain\u2019t he?\u201d Colt said.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2019s Edgard.\u201d</p><p>She squirmed, not sure how much she should reveal.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, Chass. Real good. You\u2019re lucky you\u2019ve got two good men watchin\u2019 out for you. You deserve it. Don\u2019t ever let nobody tell you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s stomach pitched in a mixture of fear, exhaustion and emotional turmoil.</p><p>\u201cColt, why are you here? What\u2019s really goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>Colt took off his hat, crumpled it in his hands and looked over Chassie\u2019s left shoulder. \u201cLast night when we were talkin\u2019 in Ma\u2019s sittin\u2019 room, something you said started to bug me.\u201d Colt ran his fingers through his hair before he settled his cap back on his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been eatin\u2019 me up all damn day, that\u2019s why I followed you out here. The only excuse I can give you for forgettin\u2019 is that...well, I was a drunk. There\u2019s a whole helluva lot I don\u2019t remember.\u201d Colt reached in his inside jacket pocket and shoved an envelope at her. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen it and I\u2019ll explain.\u201d Colt jammed his hands in his front pockets and rocked back on his heels.</p><p>Chassie loosened the flap, reaching inside the envelope for a piece of paper. She pulled it out, gaping at it before she glanced up at her cousin in complete shock. \u201cWhat the hell? This is a check for twenty-five thousand dollars!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s ah...yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine? What? It can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. The money belonged to Dag. Over the years he, ah, sent me some of his rodeo winnings too.\u201d</p><p>Skeptical, Chassie said, \u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Colt focused on the upper bedroom window above the porch\u2014anywhere besides her face. \u201cSee, Dag and I were gonna...start a bar when he retired from the circuit. He knew if he kept the money with him or in his bank account where he could access it, it\u2019d be gone in a New York minute. So he mailed it to me and I deposited it for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just remembered this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when you mentioned the bank account Uncle Harland didn\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about, I realized I probably was supposed to\u2019ve been puttin\u2019 the money in there. Instead I deposited it in my own account.\u201d Restless, Colt shifted his stance and studied the tips of his boots. \u201cAn honest oversight and one I\u2019m sincerely sorry about. So since Dag is dead, I figure the money is yours now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>Colt finally looked at her. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Chassie whapped him in the chest with the envelope. \u201cIs it a coincidence this just happens to be the exact amount of money we need to guarantee a bank loan for Gus\u2019s land? And isn\u2019t it another coincidence you just happened to remember my brother\u2014who never had two nickels to rub together\u2014gave you exactly the same amount of money to squirrel away for him?\u201d</p><p>At least Colt had the decency to look sheepish.</p><p>Pride caused Chassie to snap, \u201cI don\u2019t want charity. Especially not from the McKays.\u201d She stuffed the check in his outside coat pocket and spun on her heel, humiliation vibrating in every fiber of her body.</p><p>Lightning fast, Colt stepped in front of her. \u201cHey, now, wait a darn minute and listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I am so pissed off at you right now, Colt McKay, it isn\u2019t even funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear me out. Please.\u201d</p><p>Chassie glanced up at him. The last time she\u2019d seen him so distressed was after he\u2019d heard Dag died. Pain and regret and...tears? shimmered in Colt\u2019s bright blue eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dammit. She was such a sucker. \u201cFine. After you answer a question for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you honestly believe I\u2019d be that gullible? Just take the check and skip to the bank not questioning my sudden good fortune?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, actually, yeah, I had hoped that\u2019d be the case.\u201d</p><p>A growl-like snarl escaped and she sidestepped him.</p><p>\u201cBut I expected you\u2019d at least hear me out and not be as stubborn as your daddy.\u201d</p><p>Chassie whirled, tired, angry, frustrated and ready to pop him one square in the mouth.</p><p>Colt grinned at her. \u201cKnew that one\u2019d get your back up, Sassy Chassie.\u201d</p> <p>Her old nickname brought a smile. \u201cFunny, Colt the Dolt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that that\u2019s out of the way, will you at least listen to me?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst off. What I said wasn\u2019t a complete lie. At one time Dag did send me money. I don\u2019t recall how much. Coupla hundred bucks probably. Anyway, when I heard how badly you wanted Gus\u2019s place, but couldn\u2019t swing the down payment, I thought this was the least I could do to help you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could give you a bullshit answer and say because you\u2019re family. But the truth is, Dag and Uncle Harland died leavin\u2019 you holdin\u2019 an empty bag with no means to refill it and that don\u2019t seem fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour family\u2019s always had more money than us, Colt,\u201d she said tactfully. \u201cI don\u2019t begrudge you for it like my dad did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should. At least my ma squirreled away the money Granddad West left us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat money?\u201d</p><p>Colt\u2019s face was troubled. \u201cGranddad West left each grandkid ten thousand bucks.\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Ma deposited ours in the bank and wouldn\u2019t let us have it until we turned twenty-one. I told Dag when I got mine. So Dag asked Uncle Harland about his, and...\u201d</p><p>Ugly, thick pause.</p><p>\u201cDad spent it all, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>Colt nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Dag found out Uncle Harland blew every bit. My understandin\u2019 was that was the last straw between them. Dag didn\u2019t so much care about his inheritance, but yours was a different story.\u201d</p><p>She felt ill.</p><p>\u201cSee you were doomed to fail before you got outta the gate, Chass. It ain\u2019t your fault,\u201d Colt said hotly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to fail, \u2019cause I know all about failure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve felt like a failure most my adult life. Cord is the oldest and a natural born rancher. Colby is the rodeo star. Cam is the hero.\u201d Colt squeezed his eyes shut briefly.</p><p>\u201cCam is even more a hero now. Carter is the smart college boy. And Keely is the long-awaited girl. Which leaves me as the fuck-up, the ne\u2019er do well middle child, the charmer, the womanizer, the drunken fool. I lived up to that bad reputation because it was all I had. All I ever saw myself as.</p><p>\u201cMy brothers\u2019ve done noble things while I\u2019ve done nothin\u2019 worth mentionin\u2019 and done plenty of things I\u2019m ashamed of. Here\u2019s a chance to make things right for someone besides myself.\u201d His vivid blue eyes were beseeching. \u201cThis is something I wanna do, something that\u2019ll let me feel as if I\u2019m lookin\u2019 after you like Dag might\u2019ve wanted me to.</p><p>I\u2019m payin\u2019 off my debt to the past by helpin\u2019 you to secure the future you\u2019ve always deserved, Chass, is that so wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy givin\u2019 me your hard earned money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow else are you gonna buy Gus\u2019s land and increase the size of your operation?\u201d</p><p>Chassie frowned. \u201cBut I thought your family wanted that section?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck my family. Maybe it\u2019s time they realized they can\u2019t always get what they want just \u2019cause their last name is McKay.\u201d</p><p>His vehemence surprised her.</p><p>Colt paced. \u201cDo you really think we need another coupla thousand acres? No. But McKay Ranches would snap it up just because they could. That acreage won\u2019t take a nickel away from our livelihood, but it sure as hell will make a huge difference in yours and Trevor\u2019s. And honestly, I\u2019ve done enough shitty things to people I care about to last me a lifetime. Jesus, Chassie, you\u2019re one of the few that\u2019s not on the list of folks I\u2019ve wronged and I\u2019d like to keep it that way. Takin\u2019 this land out from under you feels wrong.\u201d</p><p>Chassie placed her hand on his arm, stopping his nervous activity. When Colt looked at her, Chassie finally understood this offer was about more than money. It wasn\u2019t about charity. It wasn\u2019t really about guilt. It was about Colt proving he\u2019d changed, probably when no one in his family believed he could. Proving that same streak of decency running through his brothers ran through him too, even if he and Chassie were the only ones who were aware he\u2019d acted on it.</p><p>Colt\u2019s problems with his family were not her issues, but a niggling voice pointed out by Colt coming to her, he\u2019d taken on the responsibility of helping her overcome her family issues\u2014chiefly financial, by bucking his own family\u2019s best interests.</p><p>\u201cIf I take the money, what will you want in return?\u201d</p><p>Colt blanched. \u201cNothin\u2019. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo unlimited grazin\u2019 rights? Water rights? Mineral rights? Huntin\u2019 rights?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>Seemed too good to be true. \u201cI\u2019ll have to clear it with Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d expect nothin\u2019 less. I wanted to talk to you first.\u201d</p><p>Chassie yelled, \u201cHey, guys, come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys? But\u2014\u201d</p><p>She locked her gaze to Colt\u2019s. \u201cEdgard is a permanent part of the operation and of our life now.\u201d</p><p>After a second, Colt nodded.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t so hard. She expected it\u2019d get even easier in time.</p><p>When Trevor and Edgard ambled over, Chassie and Colt explained the situation.</p><p>No surprise Trevor was adamantly opposed. \u201cAbsolutely not. Like you said, Chass, if we can\u2019t come up with the cash ourselves then ownin\u2019 that place wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d\u2019ve had no problem borrowin\u2019 the money from your dad,\u201d Chassie pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Colt demanded. \u201cA loan from family is a loan from family. I\u2019m Chassie\u2019s family, which makes you family too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re lendin\u2019 us the money?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cI sure as hell ain\u2019t givin\u2019 it to you.\u201d</p><p>A sharp bark of laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s a big relief.\u201d</p><p>Colt relaxed slightly. \u201cThink of it as a long-term investment.\u201d</p><p>Trevor studied him distrustfully, not because Colt was dishonest, but because in Trevor\u2019s mind, all dealings with family were suspect. \u201cIf you ain\u2019t gettin\u2019 interest on the loan, then what\u2019s in it for you short term?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d Colt scratched his cheek thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m lookin\u2019 to diversify my part of the herd. How about you gimme first pick of your male calves durin\u2019 brandin\u2019? They\u2019re worth about a thousand bucks at that age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want all twenty-five this spring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. One or two a year\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d</p><p>Chassie gawked at her cousin in disbelief. \u201cBut that\u2019ll take years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I told you, I\u2019m lookin\u2019 at long-term.\u201d That flash of shame appeared in his eyes again, but he soldiered on. \u201cAsk me where the money I\u2019m lendin\u2019 you came from, Chassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I would\u2019ve spent on booze and women in just the last year. It\u2019s sittin\u2019 there starin\u2019 me in the face like guilt and blood money. I wanna invest it in something I believe in, which is a family ranchin\u2019 operation.\u201d Colt looked across the field, but Chassie knew he was looking far beyond what she could see. \u201cSo many of my friends are gone to greener pastures. I couldn\u2019t stand it if you were another one of \u2019em to leave, and not out of choice.\u201d</p><p>Chassie was one of the few who knew Colt\u2019s life hadn\u2019t been as carefree as people assumed and he\u2019d had fewer choices than any of his siblings.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, when I build a house on the frontage between the creek and the bluff, we\u2019ll be even closer neighbors, so it makes sense we look out for each other\u2019s best interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a flesh and blood woman all picked out to settle down with in this phantom house you\u2019re describin\u2019?\u201d Trevor prompted with a wicked grin.</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d Colt shrugged. \u201cMostly I\u2019m tired of livin\u2019 at the Boars Nest. I want my own place. Chet and Remy drew up specs and we\u2019re just waitin\u2019 on the county to clear the permits.\u201d</p><p>That surprised her. Chassie wondered if his family was privy to his plans to move away from the McKay stronghold.</p><p>\u201cSo do we have a deal?\u201d Colt asked.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Chassie launched herself at Colt, hugging him tightly. \u201cThank you. You have no idea what this means to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, little cuz, I believe I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContrary to what you think, you are a good guy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cA credit to the McKay name. Dag would be proud of you and I\u2019ll try like hell to live up to your faith in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact you were one of the few who never lost faith in me is worth every damn penny.\u201d He hugged her and climbed in his truck without another word.</p><p>\u201cThat bastard stole my thunder,\u201d Edgard groused.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d planned on talkin\u2019 to you and Chass about me making the down payment for Gus\u2019s place with the money from selling my ranch in Brazil.\u201d</p><p>Trevor caught Edgard\u2019s golden gaze. \u201cYou serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerious enough I spoke to Gus yesterday and guaranteed you and Chassie had the cash and asked him not to contact the McKays.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trevor didn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cHell, you ain\u2019t mad, are you?\u201d Edgard twisted the toe of his boot into a pile of snow.</p><p>\u201cNot mad. Just wonderin\u2019 why you did it.\u201d Wondering why Ed hasn\u2019t said anything when they\u2019d talked last night.</p> <p>\u201cTime was running out. You were both preoccupied with family shit and I couldn\u2019t stand it if we lost out on something important to all of us because of pride or fear or mixed signals. I waited until Chassie got home to discuss it because it\u2019s her future too.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s heart damn near danced out of his chest. Everything he\u2019d ever wanted was within reach; he just had to grab it with both hands. He circled one arm around Chassie\u2019s shoulder and the other around Ed\u2019s. \u201cCome on inside. Too damn cold out here.\u201d</p><p>In the kitchen, Chassie said, \u201cTrev, what happened with your dad?\u201d</p><p>Trevor poured milk in Chassie\u2019s favorite cup and put it in the microwave. \u201cPa\u2019s fine.\u201d He relayed the trip, detailing events even when he\u2019d rather avoid discussing them.</p><p>\u201cHope you didn\u2019t have your heart set on cozyin\u2019 up to my family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re my family. You deserve better than the way they\u2019ve treated you and I\u2019m damn glad you didn\u2019t knuckle under.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen.\u201d Edgard gently swept a piece of Chassie\u2019s hair away from the bandage on her forehead. She smiled, showing her acceptance of Ed\u2019s easy affection. It also showed Trevor how badly Edgard needed to share that side of himself with someone who not only welcomed it, but appreciated it and reciprocated.</p><p>It brought a lump to Trevor\u2019s throat and a balm to his soul to think Chassie was the bridge that allowed him to connect to Edgard. Without her, he\u2019d be lost on so many levels. She\u2019d taught him he was worthy of love. She\u2019d showed him how to love without conditions. She\u2019d proven understanding and acceptance were not parts of love that could be parceled out, but real, honest love needed all those components to be successful, fulfilling and long lasting.</p><p>Without Chassie, Trevor never would\u2019ve reached the point that he could accept how he felt about Edgard, say nothing of flying in the face of conventionality and proposing what he was about to propose.</p><p>\u201cAs long as we\u2019re spilling family secrets, Ed, did you tell Trevor everything that happened the last year you lived in Brazil?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI shoulda told you both right away, but I didn\u2019t want you to feel sorry for me and realize I didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich brings us back to what we\u2019ve been talkin\u2019 about.\u201d Trevor focused on his wife. \u201cHow would you feel about all three of us livin\u2019 together like we\u2019ve been? On a permanent basis?\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s fingers relaxed around her cup and her gaze zipped between his and Edgard\u2019s faces. \u201cI thought that was a given.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you? Both of you? I mean, come on. After all we\u2019ve done, not just sexually, but emotionally? We\u2019ve already begun to form a weird sort of three amigos thing. I hated it when Trevor was gone and I imagine you two missed me. And I can\u2019t fathom Trevor and me standin\u2019 on the porch waving at Ed as he drives away for good.\u201d</p><p>The mental image of Edgard leaving brought back the acute ache Trevor never recovered from that day in Cheyenne\u2014until now.</p><p>Chassie set down her cup and covered his hand with hers. \u201cTrevor, as much as I loved our life before, havin\u2019 Edgard here makes it better because you\u2019re happier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith this many people involved, the three amigos\u2014as you\u2019ve called us\u2014decisions can\u2019t be based on just one person\u2019s happiness when that decision affects all of us. Does Edgard bein\u2019 here make you happier, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Not a bit of hesitation in her answer, which boggled Trevor\u2019s mind. \u201cWhy? I mean you\u2019ll be sharin\u2019 me on a permanent basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind sharing you, especially since he\u2019s brought to life the part of you that\u2019s always been missing, a part I never had in the first place. Edgard\u2019s given me a gift by letting me see all of you, not just the part you wanted me to see because you were ashamed of the rest.\u201d She winked at Edgard. \u201cPlus, Ed can cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you so damn much.\u201d Trevor lifted her hand and kissed her knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m so goddamn lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Edgard said and kissed her other hand.</p><p>\u201cI never want either of you to be ashamed of what you feel for each other, or feel like you have to hold back in front of me or in our home,\u201d Chassie said. \u201cWhat you had was private, but now it belongs to all three of us. Can you guys handle that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 this three-way relationship will work as long as we talk to each other, just like this. No secrets. No half-truths. Tackle issues head on. Take it one step at a time to ensure we get it right for everyone.\u201d Chassie bit her lip and looked at Edgard. \u201cI know we ended up together because of how we feel about Trev, but Lord, it\u2019s crazy scary what I\u2019m startin\u2019 to feel for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Edgard touched her face. \u201cI feel the same, querida.\u201d</p><p>The confession didn\u2019t bother Trevor, but it seemed too easy. \u201cRight now we\u2019re all pumped up and cocky with \u2018screw what the rest of the world thinks of us\u2019, but can you live with the don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell reality for the long term?\u201d Trevor watched the play of emotions on Edgard\u2019s face. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this on and off, Ed, so now\u2019s the time to speak up if it\u2019s gonna be a problem for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost you once due to that line of black and white thinking, so I\u2019m past it. I could give a rat\u2019s ass about anyone who ain\u2019t in this room right now.\u201d</p><p>A sneaky smile curled Chassie\u2019s lips. \u201cWell said. Just as it won\u2019t bother me for the local busybodies to believe I\u2019m so crazy for cock I\u2019ve gotta have two of \u2019em to keep me satisfied.\u201d</p><p>Edgard choked, \u201cJesus, Chassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please. My whole life I\u2019ve listened to the outrageous sexual exploits and preferences of my male McKay cousins. It\u2019ll be a hoot to set tongues a-waggin\u2019 in Crook County that the Wests can be just as wild. As long as you\u2019re not double-teaming me on the bar top at the Rusty Spur, I don\u2019t think anyone will muster the guts to ask how good our hired man is with his hands or who he prefers to put them on.\u201d</p><p>Trevor said, \u201cMy God, woman, you\u2019re actually enjoyin\u2019 this, ain\u2019t ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She batted her lashes at Edgard. \u201cAnd to sweeten the pot of revenge, I\u2019ll make it clear to Brandy or any other woman the Brazilian meat market is not open for monkey business and you both belong to me because our relationship goes beyond business. That oughta keep all the single women in town from angling for a piece of you.\u201d</p><p>Edgard smiled. \u201cWhich brings me to my other point. In the eyes of the law you two are married, but I ain\u2019t gonna be considered just a hired hand. I\u2019m not looking to prove anything to the community beyond we\u2019re in a committed partnership. Let them make of it what they will. I just want to prove to both of you I\u2019m as financially invested in the life we\u2019re building as I am physically and emotionally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuddy, if that\u2019ll make you happy and convince you we ain\u2019t kickin\u2019 you to the curb, then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019ll draw up the bank paperwork as a three-way partnership.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d He squeezed Trevor\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m beyond happy, meu amore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Jesus. I never thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, stop makin\u2019 goo goo eyes at each other at least until we\u2019ve discussed this thoroughly,\u201d Chassie gently scolded. \u201cI\u2019ve already come up with a way we can demonstrate the permanence of this relationship to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy gettin\u2019 matching tattoos.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cHell, woman, how much time have you spent with India and Colt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough. For design, I\u2019m leanin\u2019 toward searin\u2019 our cattle brand on our butts.\u201d</p><p>Edgard mock-whispered, \u201cIs she serious? Or has she been drinkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Chassie slapped his arm. \u201cAs far as us havin\u2019 babies? I want them. Bad. We\u2019ve all survived shitty family stuff, and there is potential for problems with any child we raise in an unorthodox household. Can you imagine how much that\u2019ll change the dynamic between the three of us? How hard it\u2019ll be if I have one blond-haired one and one dark-haired one, and what last name we\u2019ll give \u2019em\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll cross the baby bridge when we come to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? Ed brought up finances and you brushed him aside\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t just a woofin\u2019 about her talkin\u2019 something to death, were you, Trev?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Maybe we oughta gag her. There\u2019s a bandana in the dining room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRope too,\u201d Edgard said. \u201cLet\u2019s tie her hands so they\u2019re not flailing around makin\u2019 random tattoo designs.\u201d</p><p>She huffed out a breath. \u201cI\u2019m serious. This is serious stuff, guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is serious stuff. Life altering stuff.\u201d Trevor\u2019s strong fingers circled her wrist. \u201cBut there comes a point where you are beatin\u2019 a dead horse, and, darlin\u2019, you\u2019ve reached it.\u201d</p><p>Chassie looked to Edgard for support.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m of the \u2018less talk, more action\u2019 school of thought.\u201d</p><p>Nice sidestep, Ed. \u201cHow about we take the action upstairs to the bedroom and hammer out the rest of the details there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn fine idea, Trev. I think you nailed it.\u201d</p><p>They grinned at each other and Trevor thought it felt damn right and damn fine and was about damned time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cYou guys always gonna reroute every conversation around to sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d they said in unison.</p><p>Chassie sighed. \u201cNeither of you have asked what\u2019ll make me happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, baby?\u201d Trevor murmured.</p><p>\u201cA much bigger bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Trevor realized not every request would be so simple and easy to handle. There\u2019d be problems and adjustments. But as he looked at the two people who were his entire world, who owned his heart, who soothed his soul, and who\u2019d stand beside him no matter what, he knew he was finally ready for whatever rough challenges life threw at them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say a bigger bed is a damn fine place to start.\u201d </p>  </body></html>"]
