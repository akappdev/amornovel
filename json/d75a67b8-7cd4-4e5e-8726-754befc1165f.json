That\u2019s what she really wanted to write. Here was the truth:</p><p>\u201cNeedy, insecure, overweight twenty-six year old Business Analyst with three cats, a corporate job with pension and no debt seeks Mr. Impossible for way more than friendship and lots of ice cream. I\u2019m desperate for some physical affection and oral sex with a guy who doesn\u2019t view it as some sort of favor he\u2019s granting me, and then expects to be praised like he cleaned my toilet. One night stands are better than nothing as long as you brush your teeth. Call me!\u201d</p><p>Her best friend, Josie Mendham, punched her in the bicep. \u201cYou can\u2019t say either of those!\u201d Josie was Laura\u2019s opposite. Where Laura was 5\u20186\u201d, Josie was barely tall enough to ride roller coasters. Remove the 1 from Laura\u2019s size and you still had to go down to 2 to get Josie\u2019s. Where Laura had long, curly blonde hair and bright green eyes, Josie was chocolate all around. \u201cMutt and Jeff\u201d her mom had called them, and they\u2019d been besties since eighth grade.</p> <p>Which meant Josie knew Laura too well. \u201cYou are going to do this, damn it,\u201d she said, wagging a finger in front of Laura\u2019s face. \u201cNo trying to be perfect. Perfect is the enemy of good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even found Mr. Good Enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because the hundreds of Mr. Good Enoughs have walked past you, Laura, and you\u2019re blind to them.\u201d Josie nudged Laura aside and started typing, her long nails burning up the keyboard. How did she do that? Typing on the pads of her fingers seemed impossible, but Josie did it, keeping her manicure intact, little replicas of the famous grey necktie from Fifty Shades of Grey on each nail.</p><p>The two had been out at a club the night before and Josie spent the night, waking up chipper and springing this online dating thing on Laura before she\u2019d even had her first cup of coffee. As the machine gurgled and burbled, Laura willed it to hurry. Weighing out her entire dating future in a half-zombie state was not good.</p><p>Laura knew she had to lie, but how much was acceptable? Could she shave off a few sizes, or would she need to hack off an imaginary arm and leg to make herself seem \u201cfit\u201d and \u201cathletic\u201d? The drop-down box with its built in descriptors seemed like judgmental torment. No choices were there for \u201czaftig\u201d or \u201cjuicy\u201d or \u201cfull figure.\u201d</p> <p>Being a size 18 with size F breasts wasn\u2019t a crime, she knew; in real life she was fashionable and flowing, plump and pleasing, and could arm wrestle most guys into submission, but reducing her accomplishments, personality and, yes, body into a vocabulary designed by some Internet start-up team of nineteen-year-old dropouts from Stanford and Carnegie Mellon made her irrationally angry.</p><p>No \u2013 rationally angry.</p><p>Seeing little choice, she pointed to the boxes on the screen and told Josie, \u201cPick the word \u2018fit.\u2019 I can deadlift 105 pounds. Which is,\u201d she eyed Josie, \u201cmore than you weigh.\u201d</p><p>Josie pointedly ignored her, biting her lower lip and deep in concentration. \u201cVoila!\u201d she shouted, her hands spread wide in a grandiose gesture. \u201cThere\u2019s your ad.\u201d</p><p>She announced:</p><p>\u201cLuscious, curvy Business Analyst seeks friendship and more. Financially independent and self-assured, I\u2019m a fit woman who wants a man (or, more than one! YOLO!) for stimulating conversation...er, yeah. Conversation. Message me (or massage me!).\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t write that!\u201d Laura groaned. \u201cIt makes me look like I want an orgy!\u201d She squinted at the screen. \u201cAnd what the hell is \u2018YOLO\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want an orgy?\u201d Josie wiggled her eyebrows lasciviously and stuck out her tongue, waggling it like she was performing a very bad imitation of oral sex. \u201cAnd YOLO stands for \u2018you only live once.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut it out. You\u2019re turning me on. It\u2019s been that long since I got some ass, and the last guy used his tongue like he was a Roto Rooter man. Like that.\u201d She pointed at Josie\u2019s tongue and bent over, laughing.</p><p>And then Josie, with a flourish, pressed the \u201cSubmit\u201d button. \u201cThank you for joining \u2013 your profile is now live!\u201d the screen read.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit, Josie, did you just do that?\u201d Laura sputtered, spilling creamy coffee all over her sleeve as she grabbed the mouse. \u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Josie batted her eyelashes. \u201cLive a little. See who replies!\u201d She grabbed her heavy, over-full Vera Bradley purse that they had discovered at a local thrift shop for $3.99 and fingered her car keys. \u201cGotta go, Laura. And don\u2019t you dare delete that.\u201d</p><p>Laura laughed. \u201cYou know me too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Josie muttered. Her face turned serious. \u201cReally, Laura. You need to get out there. Some guy is being deprived of your awesomeness. And besides, your budget needs the break.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy budget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. What are you spending in batteries for Bob?\u201d</p><p>Confused, Laura shook her head. It was like Josie spoke a foreign language sometimes. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour battery-operated boyfriend. You know \u2013 BOB.\u201d And with that she snickered, running for the door as Laura threw a section of a fashion magazine at her. Josie\u2019s evil laughter filled the apartment as she ran down the hallway, the sound fading once she hit the stairwell. \u201cHave a good day at work!\u201d she hollered from the street.</p><p>The coffee machine gave its death-rattle gasp that signaled the pot was done, and Laura went to drink it greedily, needing sustenance to kick her brain into gear. Enough caffeine and she could date anyone. Hmm, maybe she should do a search for baristas on that site. Free lattes would be a nice perk.</p><p>Dylan Stanwyck couldn\u2019t quite believe what he saw when he logged into the online dating site. Four months of weeding through so many crappy profiles had jaded him. Finding the right woman would be like coming across the proverbial needle in a haystack, but in this case he didn\u2019t want to face any pricks.</p><p>And yes, women could be pricks. So far he had been inundated with requests to chat, and he knew exactly why. Being a firefighter who competed in weightlifting competitions for fun, along with the occasional mini triathlon, made his pictures look quite nice. The problem with the women who were responding to him was that they were also the type to be drawn to appearances only. It seemed so shallow of him to think it, but sometimes being built the way he was could be a curse.</p><p>Curse of the Jersey Shore chicks. Because that was the type who seemed to seek him out, like moths to a flame. A trashy, Snooki-like flame of ho-dom. When he would meet up with these women he found himself in some alternate universe, where they licked their lips and offered themselves up in the alley behind the nice tapas restaurant where he liked to take women. A few goat cheese stuffed dates and pitchers of sangria later and he was being humped up against a slimy brick wall next to the trash cans.</p><p>And when he turned them down...he still had scars from one woman\u2019s long, overdone nails raking his neck as she screeched, \u201cYou don\u2019t know me!\u201d over and over, requiring police assistance as passersby gawked, took pictures they probably uploaded to Reddit, and mercifully called 911 on his behalf.</p><p>So when this new profile for Laura appeared, he peered at the description and leaned back in his chair, taking a deep breath. Cute. But not too cute. A little sassy. He liked sassy. He ran a hand through his thick, wavy hair. Time to get a haircut, dude. You look like a survivalist. And smell like one, too, he thought as he studied her picture and caught a whiff of himself. His morning run was done, 3.8 miles logged on his online fitness program, and he reeked.</p><p>She looked like a 1940s pin up girl. A little plumper, with soft curves to her shoulders, a fuzzy, lime-green sweater accentuating her breasts. Her jaw line seemed firm and gentle all at once, and what appeared to be naturally-blonde hair was swept up off her face in a pony tail. His mom would call her a \u201ccorn-fed farm girl\u201d and those lips \u2013 lush and grinning a half smile that seemed to say \u201cKiss me, Dylan.\u201d</p><p>Smart, too. A business analyst? Sounded suitably bland and yet signaled she was smart enough to carry her own in a conversation about something other than Kim Kardashian or Fifty Shades of Grey (really \u2013 why? Why had every date for the past two months mentioned it?). A real woman. What a refreshing change.</p><p>So he continued reading:</p><p>\u201cLuscious, curvy Business Analyst seeks friendship and more. Financially independent and self-assured, I\u2019m a fit woman who wants a man (or, more than one! YOLO!) for stimulating conversation...er, yeah. Conversation. Message me (or massage me!).\u201d</p><p>Something fierce and hot inside him came to life. From that description it sounded like she...seriously? No way.</p><p>\u201cMike! Hey, Mike! Get in here!\u201d If there were a chance \u2013 any chance at all, here, then he had to act fast. Someone this amazing was about to get inundated by messages from needy weirdos.</p><p>And he needed to be the first.</p><p>His roommate wandered in. Where Dylan was all muscle and brawn, Mike Pine was tall and sleek, a marathoner\u2019s body of long, lean tissue. Dylan\u2019s dark, Italian, thick looks made him popular with women, but Mike was the golden boy, with blonde hair and blue eyes, the long distance runner with a soft heart, the guy women turned to and poured their hearts out, Mr. Sensitive to Dylan\u2019s Mr. Conquest.</p><p>Dylan tapped the screen. \u201cTake a look at her.\u201d He smiled smugly as Mike\u2019s eyes raced across the screen. They\u2019d been waiting for a long time. Too long. His roommate\u2019s expression told him everything he needed to know. Score! It might finally be time.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think that\u2019s some sort of code for being up for a threesome?\u201d Mike asked, eyebrows arched. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Dyl...I think it\u2019s just some sort of joke she\u2019s making. You know how nervous and weird people can be when they try to distill their entire life into a few sentences.\u201d</p><p>Dylan chewed on the inside of his cheek. Bad habit. \u201cGood point. Well, even if she isn\u2019t into a nice menage arrangement, she is one fine woman.\u201d A low whistle escaped from his lips. \u201cI have a project on my hands now, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded, peering at the screen, eyes lingering. \u201cYou are going to have a lot of competition.\u201d</p><p>Dylan snorted. \u201cLike I give a fuck. May the best man win.\u201d</p><p>Mike went silent, then grinned, his fresh-faced boy-next-door look morphing into a Wall Street trader\u2019s predatory smile that made Dylan suddenly uncomfortable for no reason he could pinpoint. \u201cYeah. I hope he does.\u201d</p><p>Ding! The little chat box on the online dating site lit up like a Christmas tree. Laura sucked the last mouthful of her coffee and gaped at the screen. You have got to be kidding me, Laura thought. Already? She clicked and read a message from \u201c9inluvr\u201d:</p><p>Hey, babe. I live in the city and so do you, so let\u2019s hook up for some FWB action. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She snorted. Oh, sure. Just like that. Yer a catch, Bud. A real romantic.</p><p>Ding! This one was from some guy named Dylan. Before she read the chat she looked at his profile.</p><p>Well hellooooo there, Mr. Firefighter. A thin line of drool formed at the corner of her mouth, an instant response to the picture before her. It was a professional picture, the guy wearing no shirt, a fireman\u2019s hat perched at a jaunty tilt. Like a stripper\u2019s picture in a firefighter\u2019s role. Oh, God. I can\u2019t date a stripper, she thought. He\u2019d have nicer g-strings than mine.</p><p>But no \u2013 he was a real firefighter. The picture, he explained in his profile, came from a charity bachelor auction he was in. Bachelor auction? How much had he gone for? As she studied the picture she figured it had to be a solid four figures. Hell, she was ready to empty her life savings for a night with this guy.</p> <p>On a whim she Googled \u201cDylan charity bachelor auction firefighter\u201d and her drool increased so much she would soon need a bucket.</p><p>Oh, holy hell. The image search showed the same man, whose name was Dylan Stanwyck, in firefighter\u2019s pants, boots, a fireman\u2019s hat and suspenders, perched on the floor of a fire station right next to the pole. He was leaning on one elbow and had smears of soot on him, with well-oiled muscles and a smug-ass grin. Whoever set up that photograph needed to be recruited for her company\u2019s marketing department because damn \u2013 she was ready to use up every available dollar on her credit cards to get a night with him.</p><p>Maybe she could save a bunch of money and just set herself on fire. Or her car. It probably wasn\u2019t worth much, but if she found out his schedule and whether he\u2019d be the one responding...</p><p>And he was pinging her on the dating site? She dropped her coffee and scrambled to write back in the chat room.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, all inspiration and creativity vanishing as the heat forming between her legs apparently melted her brain.</p> <p>Hi. I\u2019m Dylan. Nice to \u201cmeet\u201d you. :)</p><p>Think, Laura. Think. Man, where was Josie? Of all the times for that girl to be on time to go to work. She needed help figuring out something witty to say.</p><p>Hi. I\u2019m Laura. Nice to \u201cmeet\u201d you, too!</p><p>She wrote back. Then he answered:</p><p>You\u2019re probably on your way to work analyzing businesses, or businessing analysis, or whatever it is you do ;). I was hoping you might be interested in going out? We can do coffee, maybe? Or go to a nice tapas bar?</p><p>Tapas! Her favorite! But wait \u2013 Josie always said any guy who likes tapas must be gay. Laura checked the photo again. No way. And even if Dylan was gay, she would still sleep with him. Cute, polite, and loves tapas?</p> <p>Tapas sounds great! When?</p><p>Dammit! Now she sounded too eager. And then he waited. And waited. No reply. Shit! Maybe he was having second thoughts. Or she sounded like a moron. Or he realized he didn\u2019t like tapas after all. Or he really was gay. Or this was his cat impersonating him. She began to pace, willing the chat bar to ping. If she stared hard enough, maybe it would come \u2013 now! No, now! Or...now!</p><p>Finally:</p><p>Uh, this might seem too eager, but I don\u2019t care. I am free tonight. I work a 24 tomorrow, so this is my last chance for a few days. I don\u2019t mean to be rude, asking you on short notice, but...please tell me you\u2019re free tonight.</p><p>Yes! Yes, yes, yes, she wanted to write. But she needed to play that stupid game, the dance of meeting someone new. Her turn to wait. She reread his message. What was a 24? She puzzled over that one as she chewed on her nailbed, pulling on it until it bled. Brilliant! Screw up your manicure when you have a hot date tonight, Laura.</p><p>Might have. Might have. Don\u2019t put the cart before the horse.</p><p>I am free. Prince William is now taken and so I have an opening in my busy social schedule.</p><p>She hit \u201cSend\u201d before she could change her mind. Too cheesy?</p> <p>LOL. Sounds great. Meet me at Tempo Bistro after work. At 6?</p><p>Tempo Bistro? The most expensive, chi-chi restaurant in town? Not tapas, either \u2013 something she couldn\u2019t quite remember. Asian fusion? How on earth could a firefighter afford that? Not your problem, Laura. And she was making terrible assumptions. She needed to assume they were going dutch. Good thing she was a careful saver.</p><p>\u2018lo?</p><p>The chat window pinged. Geez, Laura. Get out of your head. She typed furiously:</p><p>Sounds even better. I\u2019ll see you there and you know what I look like.</p><p>And he replied,</p><p>Oh, yes. :P</p><p>What was that supposed to mean? Her eyes swept over the clock \u2013 now she had eight minutes to shower. Damn! Laura just shook her head and walked to the bathroom, stripping naked by the time she crossed the threshold and turned on the hot water.</p><p>Sliding under the spray was bliss, the beads of water trailing their way down her body, her hair wet and ropy within seconds, the curl relaxed and the strands stretching long enough to tickle the top of her sacrum. Eh \u2013 why not leave the ad up? Who knew. Maybe she\u2019d attract a better breed of guy. Or, at least, a different kind. She eyed the shower head \u2013 did she have time? Eight minutes?</p><p>More than enough for the last guy she dated.</p><p>Just enough time for some intimate attention from Mr. Showerhead, though. Josie was wrong. It wasn\u2019t her battery bill that was getting expensive. Her water bill, on the other hand...</p><p>Good thing her vibrator was waterproof. As she soaped up she was cognizant of the time, knowing she had minutes to finish. Pulling up the old standby fantasy always worked. Two men, luscious and thickly-muscled, both in the shower with her. Mmmm...</p><p>The extra tip of her vibrator slid along the soft, sensitive skin of her clit as she perched one foot on the tub, opening up for access to slide in her fantasy lover, who was soaping her body with his sculpted, large hands, hands that smoothed over her curves, cupping her ass to pull him toward her, sliding his enormous cock in her while the other nameless, faceless lover kissed her, hard, his tongue lashing against her and exploring as the spray rolled down in rivulets between them, gathering at her folds and adding to the tease on her clit.</p><p>Her passage tightened as she imagined him bending down, on his knees, his tongue now lapping where the vibrator\u2019s little antennae tweaked her, not her own hands moving the thick shaft in and out but the lovers\u2019, four hands at once on her as one mouth descended on her eager, red nub, the other man thrusting her up against the shower\u2019s wall, her body ready for more.</p><p>She tensed, knowing she was so close, craving all these hands, more than enough for two men who wanted and needed her, the familiar muscled cresting of her climax so innate she barely cried out, the release perfunctory but oh, so welcome.</p><p>And, now, the guilt. Because how could a \u201cnormal\u201d woman really want two men at once? As she absent-mindedly rushed through the rest of the shower, quickly washing off her trusty toy, a persistent voice said, You, Laura. You.</p><p>She really did. Some wishes were never meant to be, she sighed inwardly, drying her hair and rushing to get dressed.</p><p>Just a fantasy that got her off.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help that she felt like there was a huge discrepancy between what she saw in herself, and what she saw in the pictures of Dylan, and what she saw when she did a search for him online. This guy was a catch; not just a catch, but a catch. Like, the difference between catching a good size bass in a great lake versus catching a giant, enormous marlin. He was outstanding. There was no other term for it.</p><p>He looked like something that was sculpted by an artist and the more that she thought about it and the more that she mulled over it, the more that she was excited about it \u2013 the more it turned her into a quivering, uncharacteristically nervous pile of goo.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this, Josie,\u201d she said that night as she prepared for the actual date. Dylan had picked out a rather nice restaurant in a part of town that was above her pay grade, and she wondered how on earth he could afford it on a firefighter\u2019s salary. But she wasn\u2019t going to question it because maybe, just maybe, she had finally found somebody who was going to treat her properly. The way she had always dreamed of being treated, and not treated like a booty call or a person you\u2019d settle for when you want something more.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than ready and you know it, Laura. It\u2019s about time you found some guy who...\u201d Josie looked at the screen again. \u201cOh, dear, I don\u2019t think I remember what I was about to say because I\u2019m about to burst into flames if I look at that guy one more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mine,\u201d said Laura, baring her teeth in a fake show of territoriality. It wasn\u2019t that fake, though. Some part of her meant it.</p><p>\u201cI can look. I know I can\u2019t touch, but I know I can look,\u201d Josie joked.</p><p>Laura had picked out clothes, being as meticulous as possible today, trying so hard to cover what she felt were definitely deficits. Big enormous deficits. Calling her a fluffy woman would be a perfectly nice euphemism, if you didn\u2019t prefer the term fat. Not fat in a derogatory way. Just fat as a practical, pragmatic way of describing how she was. It\u2019s not like you get to be a size eighteen by meticulously eating 700 calories a day and never, ever doing anything wrong in terms of what you put in your mouth. She couldn\u2019t stand it when people would claim that they\u2019re fat because of your genes, they\u2019re fat because they have a thyroid problem, they\u2019re fat because because because because.</p><p>She owned it. She was fat because she put too much unhealthy stuff in their mouth and even of the healthy stuff she put in her mouth, she put in too much. And she didn\u2019t really mind it \u2013 she liked food. She really, really liked food. Enjoyed it. Savored it. Pleasured it. Found it to be a joy in her life.</p><p>And she paid the price with the extra pounds, the padding \u2013 what a lovely euphemism that was, too. She liked her curves; the curves made her feel normal, gentle, open, emotional, bare. You couldn\u2019t hide from a curve; you couldn\u2019t hide from a love handle or from a padded hip or from a booty that made enough men blush and drool. She knew it was an asset (pun intended) to some guys.</p><p>What she hoped \u2013 what she deeply hoped \u2013 was that with a guy like Dylan, maybe, just maybe, she could beat the odds and find someone like him who really valued someone like her. So far that hadn\u2019t been the case. Online dating had turned out to be a giant nightmare of electrons that didn\u2019t line up exactly the way that anybody had planned. She seemed to photograph well because she got an awful lot of come-ons and she figured, you know, maybe there was something to that.</p><p>She was blonde, she had a healthy glow in her face and a pretty decent smile with two dimples that appeared when she laughed hard enough. Her shoulders carried some of her weight, but it just made her look bosomy and big chested, and if she picked the right form-fitting sweater she could come across a good twenty pounds lighter than she really was. And that may have been part of the problem, because it was always that look that the guys gave her when she walked into the bar, the coffee shop, the plaza, the restaurant \u2013 whatever public place that they intended to meet.</p><p>It was that look, that fucking look.</p><p>It was a look of surprise \u2013 and not good surprise. It was the look of, oh, you\u2019re not what I was looking for. Oh, you\u2019re not what you look like in your picture. Oh, you\u2019re a fat chick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh.</p><p>Sometimes they had the decency to tell her the truth and to actually say those things. Yeah, really \u2013 the decency. Because it was better to hear it up front, to her face, in her face even, than to sit down with that type of guy, to try to read the signals, the tilt of the face, the grin, the look in his eyes, the lack of a look in his eyes if he glanced away. All of the little tells, the way he held his hand, the way he fidgeted, the way he reached for his phone for a text that didn\u2019t really exist. Those sights and sounds and smells and movements that added up to one thing.</p><p>Rejection.</p><p>And so far, she had had a few one night stands, a few guys who were willing to fuck the fat chick. But, you know, she didn\u2019t turn them down because the offers were few and far between. Most recently, like she had told Josie, she was sick of it. Just sick of it. So this last ditch attempt really was the final gasp.</p> <p>Dylan seemed too good to be true. Here she stood in front of Tempo Bistro at 6 p.m. sharp wearing a pencil skirt, really nice high heels, and a mohair sweater, the same one she had worn in the dating site picture, just so she could \u2013 in her own head, in her own internal thoughts \u2013 not consider herself to have been falsely advertising.</p><p>Her hair was pulled back in the same funny little ponytail and her eyes were sparkling with hope that she dredged up from deep, deep inside, and plunked down in front of him, ready to try once more.</p><p>Getting ready for this first date with Laura had turned out to be a hell of a lot more complicated than it had any right to be. First of all, it turned out he got his dates wrong. His 24-hour shift was actually that night. Tonight. So he had to change shifts with Murphy, and Murphy, who wasn\u2019t known for granting favors easily, not only extracted another 24-hour shift out of him, but also convinced him to give up his beloved Red Sox tickets for the next game. And Dylan reluctantly gave it up, hoping like hell that this date was really going to be worth it, really hating the sly grin on Murphy\u2019s face.</p><p>Hey, he was taking a chance that maybe it really was worth it. Four different clothing changes later, he finally settled on something that he resembled \u201cbusiness casual\u201d in the corporate world. She worked as a business analyst for some large nameless, faceless corporation and that meant that she probably had an expectation about what a guy would look like. Dylan\u2019s general preferred state of dress was some old concert t-shirt from the 90\u2019s, a pair of ripped up jeans and whatever pair of shoes were comfortable enough to pass muster.</p><p>Wearing business casual pants, a buttoned-down shirt, and \u2013 tie or no tie? He had finally settled on no tie. He felt like a fraud. If he just added some penny loafers and a loose cotton V-neck that showed the top of his chest he would look like something out of a Macy\u2019s ad, which actually would\u2019ve been possible ten years ago when he dipped his toe in the world of modeling before realizing that most of the people in that business were douche bags and he couldn\u2019t stand it.</p> <p>\u201cHey, who died? You look like you\u2019re going to a funeral, man,\u201d said Mike, walking into the room looking pretty natty himself in a similar outfit, just without the black pants. Mike was wearing khakis and some kind of boat shoes that Dylan thought had gone out of fashion back in the 80\u2019s, when he was a kid. The guy managed to make Superman look puny. He could have been a stunt man for The Avengers, minus the confidence. For whatever reason, Mike was a man without swagger. He just was, a steady presence that made Dylan feel complete.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, man?\u201d he challenged. \u201cWhy are you all dressed up? You got a hot date, too?\u201d He narrowed his eyes and peered at his roommate, wondering. Nah, no way. He didn\u2019t. Mike hadn\u2019t gone out in eighteen months, not since Jill died.</p><p>Mike grinned. \u201cI wish. Meeting at the ski resort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s July!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but we start getting ready now, believe it or not. Some people actually plan out processes and don\u2019t always fly by the seat of their pants.\u201d He muttered the last sentence under his breath but clearly meant for Dylan to hear every word.</p><p>Dylan just shook his head and said, \u201cI like being a pantser.\u201d Big grin. \u201cHave fun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be doing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mike replied, then paused, seeming to think over what he\u2019d just said.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Dylan laughed, grabbing his keys. \u201cDon\u2019t wait up for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying overnight at my cabin, so no worries. You have the place to yourself. I hope things work out with Laura. That,\u201d he paused, brow furrowed, \u201cthat could really benefit everybody, huh?\u201d Mike winked and the two hugged, Dylan forced to reach up to the only person in his life taller than him. And broader.</p><p>\u201cYeah, something like that,\u201d Dylan said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell her about the money?\u201d Mike\u2019s voice was more defiant than usual, as if challenging Dylan to some sort of battle he didn\u2019t even know was on the horizon. Dylan knew, though, that the tone in Mike\u2019s voice was as much about his own demons; neither had ever expected this kind of surprise from Jill\u2019s death. They would both gladly give it all up to have her back. Barring that, though, the money was certainly a welcome, if perplexing, change in their lives.</p><p>It meant nothing and it meant everything. Neither had said a word to anyone. Not a word to their friends or coworkers. Mike had quietly purchased the ski resort where he worked; it had been up for sale for a long time and was on the brink of financial collapse due, largely, to inept management and an owner who viewed it as a losing business. Mike would change that, Dylan knew. Having the money to buy the ski resort and one of the nicest cabins on the mountain had blown some life back into his partner. Too bad they didn\u2019t have the third who would complete them, taking a dull dyad and turning it into a robust triad.</p><p>Maybe Laura would...ah, who knew?</p><p>\u201cNo, of course I am not going to tell her about the money.\u201d Dylan turned away from Mike and finished pulling on his sweater. \u201cCan you imagine that scene? \u2018Oh, hi, I\u2019m Dylan and I am a billionaire.\u2019\u201d He choked on the word, his face flushing and going cold at once, the syllables so fake. So poseur. Like a little kid dressing up in Dad\u2019s dress shoes, or a teen trying on personalities to find the right fit. Except he had no choice here. Jill had left them this fortune and it was theirs. No trying anything on for size. This was serious money and Dylan and Mike had been catapulted from working class stiffs to billionaire bachelors.</p> <p>\u201cBillionaire.\u201d Mike lifted his chin, as if sniffing something. \u201cIt does roll off the tongue nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike Pine, billionaire,\u201d Dylan announced grandly, jumping on the bed and bouncing like a mad monkey. His hair flopped in his eyes and he watched Mike plant his hands on his hips, shaking his head, as if faced with a recalcitrant, hyperactive eight year old.</p><p>\u201cYou are such a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I am a wealthy child!\u201d Bounce bounce bounce \u2013 boom! Dylan jumped off the bed and bounded onto the floor next to Mike, like a superhero landing. Mike\u2019s eyes went from amused to pained, then his shoulders slumped forward. Dylan rubbed the soft spot between his shoulder blades and they both stared at a spot on the wall that seemed to contain everything they yearned for.</p><p>\u201cShe left us all this money, Dyl. We had no idea.\u201d Dylan shifted uncomfortably and said nothing. Mike picked up on his change, though, and turned to him with an accusing look. \u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>Dylan dropped his hand from Mike\u2019s back and sighed. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t know she was a billionaire! But I figured out pretty early on that she had money. We were in college, Mike. The dot com boom hadn\u2019t happened, and she claimed to make money off \u2018websites.\u2019 How do you think she could afford to spot us on all those trips we took?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe camped and kept it cheap, Dylan,\u201d Mike sputtered. \u201cShe didn\u2019t live like a crazy-rich person.\u201d Blinking hard, Mike started to say more but turned toward the dresser where Dylan kept a picture of Jill. The three of them on Cape Cod, at First Encounter Beach, the green marsh grasses so thick that hundreds of thousands of minnows lived in the shallow waters there, almost giving the water a viscosity of live, teeming fish. The ocean has been so perfect, the water warm though thrashing for a bay that day, and the three of them peered into the sun, some random stranger stopped and asked to take a pic.</p><p>A pic taken a month before they knew Jill had lymphoma. For the month after that trip she\u2019d been fatigued. Not herself. Quiet. Waving away their concerns, she had trudged on, working on her \u201cwebsites\u201d and going for long runs that turned into long walks and that, finally, turned into a leisurely stroll during which she\u2019d collapsed. Mike had been with her and carried her three city blocks to the emergency room of a hospital. The next few days were a blur Dylan couldn\u2019t let himself resurrect.</p><p>Not now. Not as he prepared to go out with someone new. Someone vibrant.</p><p>Someone alive.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jill kept a lot of secrets from us, Mike.\u201d His partner bristled; the wound was still too fresh.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s continue her legacy, then, and keep the money a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, sure. When the time\u2019s right, we can talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Mike ran a shaking hand through his hair and stared out the window at the city below. \u201cWhat a fucking curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a blessing.\u201d</p><p>Angry eyes met Dylan\u2019s as Mike spun around. \u201cCall it whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s both,\u201d Dylan conceded.</p><p>\u201cIt just is \u2013 you\u2019re right. It\u2019s both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get to save the resort. You know Jill would have been happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then why didn\u2019t she save it? Why, Dylan, didn\u2019t she tell us she had all this money? I mean, damn! It\u2019s not something you casually forget to mention. \u2018Oh! That\u2019s right! I\u2019m part of the richest point-whatever-oh-one percent in the world. While you were complaining about your ski mountain going under, did that slip my mind? Oops!\u2019\u201d The sneer in Mike\u2019s voice was utterly uncharacteristic and made Dylan recoil. Dude was pissed.</p><p>The anger, Dylan knew, was really a form of mourning.</p><p>\u201cTell it to Jill, Mike.\u201d The words took the winds out of the larger man\u2019s sails, his body literally shrinking before Dylan\u2019s eyes. Jill\u2019s ashes were on that very mountain Mike had just bought \u2013 a big reason for his purchase. Now he could have her forever, safe and sound and secure.</p><p>But still dead.</p><p>Mike bit his upper lip and nodded. \u201cYeah. I will.\u201d Dylan was running late for his date and slipped out the door quietly. He was ready to move forward, to move on, to continue past the past. Someday \u2013 soon \u2013 he hoped Mike could join him.</p><p>He looked at his smart phone. Shit, he was already running late. No way he was going to blow this by making her think he was standing her up. A quick look in the mirror again, a little bit more cologne. A final check of his smile in the mirror and he walked out of the apartment and into what he hoped would be a part of his future.</p><p>Mike could stew in the past.</p><p>Laura wasn\u2019t quite sure what to make of this as she paced a safe distance from the restaurant, trying to leave herself an out if she needed to save face and just disappear. A sink hole might have been better, but she couldn\u2019t conjure one at will. Running away in shame, though, she was familiar with \u2013 so she skulked three storefronts from the entrance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had said 6:00 and it was 6:07. Seven minutes normally meant nothing in terms of the wheel of life. But right now each second felt like torture and 420 tortures were adding up to one big ball of fear. And it all rested right in her gut where desire should be right now, where happiness should be right now, where joy and, well \u2013 not quite love, but at least lust should be residing.</p><p>Not this pit of despair.</p><p>It\u2019s only seven minutes Laura, it\u2019s only seven minutes Laura, she said to herself. The seconds ticked on until her smart phone clicked over and now it was eight minutes. It\u2019s only eight minutes Laura, it\u2019s only eight minutes Laura, it\u2019s only eight minutes. A thin bead of sweat burst under her lip, and on her cheeks, and in that valley between her breasts in a way that only the cold irrational anxiety of dating could bring out in her.</p><p>Oh, fuck this, she said to herself. I don\u2019t think I can do this anymore, even Mr. Hotty Hot Hot Firefighter isn\u2019t worth this. I\u2019m just going to go home and have a date with Ben and Jerry \u2013 that\u2019s my comfort zone, right there baby. Maybe the most dependable men on Earth because this, this is bullsh \u2013</p> <p>Zzzz, the phone buzzed suddenly. She had it on vibrate and she startled and it fell out of her hands, clattering to the ground.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she shouted, reaching down, scrambling after it and hoping that the screen hadn\u2019t broken. Luckily, she had a protective case on it, and grabbed it and slid her finger across the screen to answer the call.</p><p>\u201cHello? Hello?\u201d she said, trying desperately to keep her eagerness out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d a deep man\u2019s baritone greeted her, with a friendliness that he had no right to offer her right now \u2013 yet she was so glad he did. \u201cUh,\u201d he hesitated, \u201cis this Laura?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, it is,\u201d she answered brightly, her voice a little too high-pitched, her anxiety a little too intense right now, but she trudged on.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah, really?\u201d The voice stammered. \u201cYeah, this is Dylan. I am so sorry,\u201d he said, and she hoped that the sincerity was true. Hoped it was true, needed it to be true with a part of her that knew...that knew that there was no way of knowing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m running late. I am walking down Twelfth Avenue right now, and, in fact, I can see the entrance to the restaurant and, wait a minute, ooh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d A low wolf whistle. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What? What did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, there is this gorgeous woman just standing out there and, and I don\u2019t know, I mean, I think \u2013 let\u2019s see, she\u2019s wearing a fuzzy sweater and a damn fine gray pencil skirt and heels that make her legs go on forever. And, I don\u2019t know, you know, Laura \u2013 I may have to date her tonight instead of you.\u201d</p><p>She nearly dropped her phone again. Oh, my God, her brain burned, her internal voice screaming like a rat stuck in a cage with Napalm all over it and lit on fire. And then she got it, calming down instantly. Oh, oh, he was complimenting her. He was joking. He liked her. Who was this guy?</p><p>Now she could see him. Deep breaths, Laura, she told herself. He was joking around. Being playful. Not mean. He was a block and a half away, walking toward her with a swagger, with a confidence she didn\u2019t see in many men. One hand in his pocket, just marching down the street like he had all the time in the world. And boy, were his eyes eating her up. She could feel it from a block and a half, now a block and a quarter away.</p> <p>She was giving it right back.</p><p>Her heart was beating a million times a minute from the fear about his joke, and the anxiety that the joke had triggered. But now \u2013 but now it was like the electrons were playing between them. Molecules were flying millions and millions of miles a second between the two of them. She wasn\u2019t sure what she was going to do when they actually stood two feet from each other, because she was ready to take him right there, right then on the street, public indecency be damned.</p><p>Pretty soon, just seconds later, he was down to a block, half a block, and he took his hand out of his pocket, giving her a wave. And she realized that he had been talking to her the entire time and she had no idea what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cLaura? Laura? Hello, hello \u2013 are you there? I can see you and you\u2019re just standing there. I am waving at you right now... Laura, have I mistaken you for a human being or are you a really hot store mannequin?\u201d He heard her laugh. Aha. Keep going, Dylan told himself. Recover from the terrible joke.</p><p>\u201cOr part of some performance art thing like that guys like me don\u2019t understand? Were you Andy Warhol\u2019s protege? Or is this some sort of flash mob set-up and nineteen naked members of the Pirate Party are about to appear and don Mickey Mouse masks in some geopolitical protest?\u201d She suddenly folded and bent over laughing. He breathed a sigh of relief. Sweet!</p><p>That was it \u2013 she was forcing him to use every remaining brain cell in his body to process basic bodily functions as every red blood cell rushed to his groin. He couldn\u2019t stop raking her body with his eyes. He couldn\u2019t stop eating her with his retinas. She was some kind of Dylan magnet. Her entire appearance was luscious and her eyes \u2013 as he got closer he saw the kindness, the sweetness in them. There was a beauty, a full body, full-fledged gorgeousness about her that made him hard instantly.</p><p>\u201cStupid business casual,\u201d he muttered to himself, mouth tilted away from his phone. He was wearing the kind of pants where his arousal could become very obvious.</p><p>Now that he stood in front of her, no more than a foot and a half separating them, he felt like the biggest idiot on the planet for even joking about not dating her. She was stunning, all curves and woman and he wanted to smell her, bury his face in that sweet neck, feel her in his arms and listen to her breath as he made her happy.</p> <p>What did her cries of ecstasy sound like? Would she turn her face away? Bite the pillow? Rake lines of ownership into his back with those glossy nails?</p><p>Later. Later, he would find out. The same confidence that had always been there for him told him so. Like a second person living in his head, it just knew. She was his, and she didn\u2019t know it yet. But she would, and he had all the time in the world to teach her that.</p><p>With his tongue.</p><p>He just stood there and stared at her and didn\u2019t know what to say; he couldn\u2019t recite what went through his head as his eyes roamed over the perfect topography of her body. She stood there and stared at him and didn\u2019t seem to know what to say, either. This silent dance needed a better beat.</p><p>One he could drive home with his \u2013</p><p>Finally, she said, pointing to the door, \u201cThat is a great restaurant you picked.\u201d Her voice as breathless as he felt. Except she was actually talking and he was standing there looking like a fish out of water, his mouth practically opening and closing as he tried desperately to get something like a linear thought going.</p><p>Where the hell was that confidence now? He wasn\u2019t awkward or worried or any of those namby-pamby feelings Mike always described having. It was more that his brain had gone blank at the sight of her and everything but his arousal went into hibernate mode. She smiled and seemed to expect something intelligible to come out of his mouth, but first he had to dig his way out of the enormous, gaping hole of lust he\u2019d just tripped into.</p><p>How in the hell was she still single? Why hadn\u2019t someone snatched her up?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this whole Asian fusion thing. My friend told me it would be a good idea to bring a first date here and it might be a place to impress somebody. Not tapas, I know...\u201d And the food is supposed to be amazing, but that\u2019s secondary. She seemed so nervous, those glittering eyes wary, already on guard from his lame attempt at humor on the phone.</p><p>He felt like an ass, could sense he was losing her, and his charm system went into overdrive, not the shallow Dylan so used to getting a woman to step out of her pants within an hour of their first drink in a bar, but the slower burning Dylan who stumbled across Jill in college years ago and who felt sucker punched and euphoric all at once.</p><p>\u201cSo impressing me is more important than the food?\u201d Laura laughed and looked at him with an uncertain caution in her eyes, a caution that he actually did not like but that spoke of something he couldn\u2019t put his finger on.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, a slow grin stretching over his face, the word more a promise than an answer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to worry about someone like me,\u201d she replied, looking away with a bashful smile, her blond ponytail sliding down the side of her creamy neck as if guarding her, creating a safe barrier and holding her in place.</p><p>He cocked his head, looked her over again and wondered what on earth was she was talking about. Standing outside the restaurant babbling like an idiot wasn\u2019t exactly his idea of a good date, though, so he just motioned her toward the door and said, \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>As she walked past him impulse took over and he put one hand on the small of her back as the maitre d\u2019 held the door open. The feeling was so electrifying, his hand on her body, that he grew even harder. Impossible \u2013 she made his body defy the laws of physics. This was already more promising than he had ever expected.</p><p>Even if this dinner was going to cost him half of an entire paycheck, he did not care. He was not really relying on his paycheck anyhow these days, he reminded himself. Finances had changed radically eighteen months ago, a surprise that he and Mike still tried to assimilate. Stop it, Dylan. Stop thinking about Jill, he told himself. None of that should enter into the calculation of the emotional side of this. Tonight is about Laura.</p><p>As they were led to their table in a smoky-grey environment, with a giant twenty-foot golden Buddha lit up in the corner and a small fountain bubbling at its feet, all he could do was stare at her feet, trying to to figure out how not to sound like another one of those guys who was desperate enough to go on an online dating site and find somebody to fuck.</p><p>Neither one of them seemed to know what to say, so he figured, being the guy, he would take the lead. That\u2019s how it would work in bed...and then his mind went blank at the flash of a vision of his face buried between Laura\u2019s soft thighs, and he practically threw the folded napkin in his lap to hide what he thought must be the tallest raging hard on ever.</p><p>He coughed. \u201cYour profile said you\u2019re from Los Angeles, but you moved here to the east coast. Who do you work for?\u201d Just then, the waitress interrupted as if on cue and asked them if they wanted a drink. Laura ordered a sake.</p><p>\u201cMake it two,\u201d he added. If she was going to go for the hard stuff, so would he. Boy, this could end up being a much more interesting date than he ever expected.</p><p>She felt like she had lost her entire vocabulary all in the past three minutes. This guy was incredible. He had taken her to the hottest place in town. Granted, his friend has recommended it, but who cared if that was the main reason why? Already, this date exceeded her experience on every other date.</p><p>Dylan seemed to care, to take the time to make a good first impression, and she loved his sense of humor even if it did nearly lead to her early demise from a heart attack via misunderstanding. She had never been taken anywhere so nice. Of course she could never tell him that. Most of the guys who dated her took her to a restaurant that had 50 inch plasma televisions blasting five different sporting events all at once, and the most gourmet item on the menu was fried mozzarella sticks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She blanked when the waitress asked her what she wanted to drink, so she blurted out sake, because it was the one drink she had ever had in an Asian restaurant years ago, when her mother had taken her to a Hibachi restaurant for her twenty-first birthday. Well, hey, sake it was. She figured one shot would loosen her up. Then she could show more of herself. With Dylan joining her, she knew she\u2019d ordered appropriately for this type of restaurant and began to let herself unclench a little.</p><p>She glanced at the table and saw that she really was revealing more of herself already. Her sweater had dipped down a little too much to show the black lace of her bra and when she looked up, she found that she did not meet Dylan\u2019s eyes with her own, but that he, in fact, was staring at the same spot she had just been looking at.</p><p>Apparently, he was not enough of a gentleman to pretend that he was not \u2013 until he cut his eyes away abruptly, threw his napkin in his lap, looked down at the menu, and said, \u201cI have no idea what any of this stuff is.\u201d Then he turned and craned his head to watch one of the servers take a tray over to a nearby table. \u201cWhatever it is, though, it smells incredible.\u201d</p><p>That loosened her up more, her nervous laughter shifting into something more genuine. This incredibly pretentious, but really sophisticated and startling special few minutes felt like it already altered reality for her. Laura couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on it, but was trying very, very hard not to make more meaning out of these few perfect moments with Dylan.</p> <p>A giddiness, unfamiliar and not fleeting (to her utter shock), filled her skin and her thoughts as she shyly caught his eye and let it settle, not looking away. Their stare deepened into something more primal, more knowing, and her insecurity faded as they communicated without words.</p><p>Interrupted by the waitress, she pulled her eyes away with regret as she brought their drinks. Dylan held his up in a toast and said, \u201cTo...business analyzing!\u201d</p><p>She nodded acknowledgment, and answered, \u201cTo firefighting,\u201d clinking glasses before they put down the empty shot glasses. She fingered the rim of her glass and then they both leaned forward on the table with great expectation.</p><p>Finally, she realized he expected her to answer the question he had asked what felt like hours ago, and she said, \u201cOh, oh, I work for Stohlman Industries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStohlman?\u201d His expression showed he was impressed. That pleased Laura \u2013 it was impressive. Stohlman was known for being very, very competitive for jobs, and it had been hard to break in to the world\u2019s third largest media company.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019ve been there well, since I graduated college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What your degree then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIT \u2013 Information Technology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a business analyst?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I work with the tech side of things.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair, folded his arms, clearly making himself comfortable, and gave her a mirthful look. \u201cSo what do you do?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed, feeling her face relax, feeling her cheeks spread and match his mirth. \u201cDo you really want to know? \u2018Cause it\u2019s awfully technical.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward on his elbows, propped his chin in one hand and said, \u201cYeah, I do want to know.\u201d</p><p>She studied his eyes. He meant it \u2013 he really meant it. Oh, man, was this really the whole package? Did she really get a gorgeous, ripped firefighter who gave a shit about what she did for a living as a business analyst for some nameless, faceless, mega corporation? If so, she didn\u2019t want to pinch herself, \u2018cause this might be a dream. Then again, there were parts of her that she certainly wanted him to pinch.</p><p>Clear the mind. Whoa there, Laura.</p><p>\u201cWell, I work in healthcare IT, and what I do right now is work on a large project for one of the state governments, making sure that their old medical records program for children who get health insurance is compliant with new federal guidelines.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Made an expression with his mouth that indicated that it was interesting and then said, \u201cYou lost me at children\u2019s health insurance...\u201d and he grinned.</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cEnough about my job. What do you do? You\u2019re a firefighter, right? So you pretty much save damsels in distress from burning buildings and rescue cats out of trees? I don\u2019t have to really know more than that,\u201d she teased.</p><p>He laughed, bright teeth gleaming, straight and perfect, speaking to orthodontia many, many, decades ago. His eyes twinkled a bit as he fingered his empty sake glass and said \u201cIt\u2019s a little more complicated than that, but you got the gist of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, come on. Tell me more. How is it more complicated? Are there, like, different levels of fire fighting?\u201d The words came out of her mouth and she felt a slow, electric feeling creep up her spine as his fingers crossed the table and reached for hers, his fingers clasping hers, the warmth shaking her, going all the way up her neck, through her hips, into her belly.</p><p>Rendering her completely speechless once again.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, peering down at her hands and then looking at her with raised eyebrows that asked an obvious question. She grinned back. He softened and clinched her hand just slightly more, and the added pressure was like having her hand turn into one big, giant, throbbing clitoris.</p><p>\u201cI do plenty of shifts where I rescue cats from burning buildings and help damsels in distress out of trees,\u201d he joked, \u201cbut mostly, these days, I am in charge of fire management safety protocols for large corporations like yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. After 9/11, we had to really tighten up on how you empty out a thirty or forty floor building, especially in the face of a disaster, or in the face of massive, multi-level, widespread fires.\u201d</p><p>She could feel the blood drain out of her face. He has just, without knowing, dredged up her biggest fear. Something in his face said that he knew it. \u201cOh god, I am so sorry, really. I did not mean to upset you. Did you lose someone in 9/11?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, no, actually I, it\u2019s just that \u2013 \u201d She took a deep breath. In through the nose, out through the mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s one of my biggest fears. I\u2019ve always been afraid of a fire in my building, and I work on the thirty-second floor.\u201d</p><p>He took his hand away form hers and clamped it over his mouth, shaking his head now, saying, \u201cI pretty much just picked the worst possible thing I could bring up during a first date, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Her heart rate resumed a normal beat. She took a risk now and reached across the table to retrieve his hand and said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s OK, really. If nothing else, it\u2019s interesting that you managed to tap into that about me, after having only known me for \u2013\u201d she glanced at her smart phone \u201d \u2013 for fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing what Google will help you figure out.\u201d</p><p>If she had had a drink in her mouth, she would have spit it all over him. Oh, my God, did he Google her? It\u2019s only fair \u2013 she had Googled him. Did he know that she had Googled him? Oh god, was there some way he could have known?</p><p>\u201cLaura?\u201d He reached out and touched her chin, tipping it up to catch her eyes. \u201cThat was a joke.\u201d</p><p>By the time the waitress brought his meal, which was something that he could not only not pronounce properly, but, by the looks of it, couldn\u2019t even guess at about half the ingredients in it, he felt like he was losing her. Idiot, idiot, idiot! How could he have brought up the burning building scenario on a first date? Within fifteen minutes, no less? God, the look on her face! It was like something collapsed. There was more to it than she was telling; he could see that and it left him with too many questions, inquiries he couldn\u2019t make right now because he was being too stupid for words.</p><p>Yet here he was, babbling on about it like it was no big deal, and that\u2019s what he did for a living, and ha ha ha, and here she was, you know, in charge of saving little kids\u2019 health insurance policies.</p><p>She began to eat her food. He dug into his. Even though he didn\u2019t like it, he welcomed the silence, perplexed by the contradiction but lately his entire life seemed to be one big steaming pile of complexity. He watched her. He took the dinner as an opportunity to just keep an eye on her. To see what she was like. To see if she was...what her body language would give away.</p><p>She kept pulling on the shoulder of her sweater, correcting everything so that the edge of her black silk bra wouldn\u2019t show, and every time she did it, a little part of him tugged. Mostly in the crotch area. But also in his heart. Because, man, was he lovin\u2019 that little piece of black lace right now.</p><p>He forced a mouthful of something that he was afraid might still be half alive in between his teeth. And then, \u201cMmmm!\u201d he groaned. \u201cThis is incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, mine\u2019s luscious.\u201d</p><p>So are you, he thought, spearing a piece of fish and holding out his fork. \u201cDo you want a bite of mine?\u201d</p><p>He held the fork out for her and she looked at him in a certain way, eyes narrowing a bit while cocking her head, one little curl floating out of her ponytail as she tucked it behind her ear and leaned forward. Her lips enveloped the fork, her mouth tugging at the piece of food as he reluctantly pulled the fork away, those lips, those lips closing over the fork. Right now, he wanted part of him to be that fork. A very big, throbbing part of him that no napkin was covering.</p><p>Chewing, she groaned; it was the sound he wanted to hear later at night in his bed or in hers or on somebody\u2019s couch or hell, in the alley by the parking lot at this point. Dylan\u2019s cock strained against his trousers, more aroused then he ever imagined possible, just from watching her eat that scrumptious piece of God knows what.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it incredible?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfection. Where does it comes from?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He glanced over at the menu and replied, \u201cMalaysia and, apparently, Tibet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a Malaysian, Tibetan piece of perfection,\u201d she said, then crinkled her brow with a bemused look. \u201cFishing in Tibet?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThe monks have to do something.\u201d A diner at one table over frowned at them and Dylan just let it roll off.</p><p>Laura speared something else on her plate and lifted the fork to him. He took it, eagerly, greedily, eating something he didn\u2019t even understand, but, watching her, his eyes boring into hers, realizing that this meal was just the appetizer and he was going to have the main course later on.</p><p>Oh, holy cow, she\u2019d never been treated like this before in her entire life. In fact she was a bit concerned that she was leaving a wet spot on the upholstered bench and that she had soaked completely through not only her thong, but also her pencil skirt and pretty much through the outer layer of the bench\u2019s covering, the pad, and into whatever store was beneath this restaurant because this guy was not just hot, he was flaming and how appropriate that he was a firefighter.</p><p>She could see it in his eyes too. Whatever was going on, there was a kismet here that really shouldn\u2019t be happening. After they exchanged their bites, like a cross between \u201cLady and the Tramp\u201d and a porno movie, she realized that she was going to go home with this guy. Laura was going to sleep with him and she was going to like it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>From the look in his eyes, he was in the same place mentally, too. Hopefully physically. They both seemed to sort of hurry through their meal and the conversation finally resumed after they had finished eating.</p><p>\u201cDo you want another drink?\u201d he asked, reaching for her hand again, now that it was free from eating dinner.</p><p>She wiped her mouth with the napkin using her other hand, set it down, and said \u201cUm, I\u2019m still too full. Maybe we could go for a walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d he said, looking away, \u201cI had planned something else, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, really? What\u2019s that?\u201d Breakfast? She stifled the thought, terrified she had actually blurted that aloud.</p><p>\u201cTurns out there\u2019s a really a nice cruise here in town that I was hoping we could go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She looked at her watch, trying to hide her churning emotions. Oh, man, it was already late. A cruise. She did some quick mental math. A couple of hours on a cruise meant there was going to be no down time \u2013 she had to work, had to get up at 6:00 in the morning, and that meant blowing out the whole night. First date. Calm down Laura, don\u2019t be a slut, don\u2019t be a slut, don\u2019t be a slut, she told herself.</p><p>Don\u2019t sleep with him on the first date, don\u2019t sleep with him on the first date if you want a second date. OK, OK. OK. Josie\u2019s voice entered in her mind. \u2018Don\u2019t sleep with him, Laura. Don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it. Unless he\u2019s incredibly hot.\u2019</p><p>Oh, yeah he is. Oh, yeah he is.</p> <p>She had this entire conversation in the period of about three seconds with herself, with Dylan looking at her with a very puzzled expression. Angel Josie and Devil Laura argued inside her head until she realized she needed to respond to Dylan\u2019s comment.</p><p>\u201cOK, yeah, sure! A cruise sounds great. Did you already get tickets?\u201d</p><p>He squinted and furrowed his brow, confused. And then his face went neutral. \u201cOh, no, actually, not yet. I just figured we\u2019d go there, and, you know, climb on.\u201d</p><p>You can climb on me, she thought. Her eyes widened. Hopefully, those words hadn\u2019t actually come out of her mouth, because at this point, she didn\u2019t know the difference between thought and spoken word as she squirmed and straightened her shirt again. The black lace seemed to jumped pop out like an erection. Which, if she could have seen his package from across the table \u2013 she suspected that he had his own little version of the black lace pokin\u2019 out somewhere in his pants.</p><p>The waitress brought the check and she had that internal dialogue that all single women have when going out on new dates. Do I offer to pick up the check? Do I offer to go halfsies? Do I...</p><p>He didn\u2019t even give her a chance. He grabbed the check, handed a credit card to the woman, and waved it off. Turning to her, reaching for her hand, he said, \u201cThank you for a lovely date. Or, thank you for a lovely meal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, well, my goodness!\u201d she said, a little taken aback that she didn\u2019t even have an opportunity to fight for the check.\u201dWell, thank you so much! I mean, I, really, I, can I, I\u2019d like to offer to the...\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou can get the next date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Oh!\u201d she said, his words sinking in, finally. \u201cNext date.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t read her. It was driving him nuts. He just couldn\u2019t read her. Had he gone too far with the next date thing? Was she offended that he was suggesting she pay for the next date? Mike had suggested that there was a great way to handle women who tended to have good solid careers; you didn\u2019t know exactly how to handle the awkwardness of who paid for first dates. He had his own thing about paying.</p><p>When he took women on dates, he had more than enough money these days now that he had come into his trust fund, which he had always viewed as a bit of curse. Now he viewed the money as one hell of a blessing, because if it meant that he could treat a woman like Laura right, then maybe he and Mike could have the future that he had hoped for. Then it wasn\u2019t just a blessing.</p><p>It was everything.</p><p>Discomfort gnawed away at him. How he had come into his trust fund was an issue he had not begun to explore, he and Mike the recipients of an annual income equal to approximately 2.7 percent of the $2.2 billion in the massive trust, split in half. The trust manager had laid it out in such clinical terms that Dylan had nearly vomited on the spot, the words twenty-nine million and change per year for life, minus management fees, pinging around his skull like a racquetball that never stops.</p><p>And that was two months ago. He still drove the same car, still worked his full shifts, but splurged in little ways, the enormity of his new-found \u2013 literally! \u2013 fortune not quite sinking in.</p> <p>Mike had bought a cabin on the slopes. Cabin wasn\u2019t quite the right word. Haven was more like it, a four bedroom ski palace that he knew would keep Mike happy for the rest of his life. The ski resort, too \u2013 which had been almost an after thought. Oh, yeah, I can save the struggling ski mountain I love, because I have more money than God now. Well, almost.</p><p>As Dylan caught Laura stealing shy looks at him, his money problems (twenty nine million of them per year) faded and he started to wonder if she could keep them happy for the rest of their \u2013</p><p>\u201cDylan? Ready to go?\u201d The waitress had taken the check, cleared the table, and was practically pulling out the vacuum to clean their spot.</p><p>The meal paid for, they stood and he put his arm around her waist. She leaned into him just enough to finally send him a signal that told him, Oh, yeah, and off they went outside. He reached for her hand, intertwining his fingers in hers. As they walked toward the boardwalk, he realized they weren\u2019t going on that cruise.</p><p>God, her scent was intoxicating. He couldn\u2019t believe that her unique mixture of perfume, musk, and soap fused together to produce this. Even better \u2013 he knew that there were other scents, other tastes that would be more divine if he could get there tonight.</p><p>Dylan stopped, finally, bursting at the seams with his own internal dialogue, his own body\u2019s cravings, and just looked at her and decided that he needed to be as forthright with her as he had been with most people throughout his life, because these games weren\u2019t cutting it anymore.</p><p>Time to make his move.</p><p>He leaned down, caressed her jawline with his right hand, and brought his lips to hers. She responded, pressing her body against his until everything, from breast to hip, was his, pushed into him, and anything he felt for her was extremely obvious right now.</p><p>They definitely were not going on that cruise.</p><p>Cruise? What cruise? She had no intentions of going on a cruise. As his kiss deepened, lips parted, as their tongues danced, she found herself roiling in ecstasy inside, going so far as to be twisted into a cliche, one leg lifting up as she stood on her tiptoes, even in high heels needing to stand on tiptoes to match him in his kiss.</p><p>His hands roamed her back. She returned the motion, her fingers splayed across the broad, muscular expanse of his shoulders, his hands cupping her jaw now, pushing, needing, needing....</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, his voice gravely and thick with desire, \u201cCan we take a pass on that cruise?\u201d</p><p>She dipped her head down and laughed softly. \u201cGood thing you didn\u2019t buy those tickets after all.\u201d</p><p>Cocking his head, he looked at her with smoky eyes and asked, \u201cDo you have a car parked nearby?\u201d She knew what he was asking, his words code for Can I take you home and fuck you without worrying about your car getting ticketed or towed?</p><p>How sweet. Most guys didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cNo car. I took the train today.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, his smile widened. \u201cI drove, so let\u2019s take my car to my place? For drinks?\u201d</p><p>Whoo \u2013 eee. Laura swallowed hard, knowing that this was really it. He wanted to sleep with her, was inviting her back to his place for it, and she ran through her mental inventory. Clean lingerie? Yes. Shaved legs? Yes \u2013 she\u2019d been optimistic. No car? Yes.</p><p>Birth control?</p><p>Oh, shit. She was on the pill, but had forgotten to take it a few days ago. Missing one day shouldn\u2019t hurt, right?</p><p>Hopefully he had a condom.</p><p>His puzzled look told her she was taking too long to think. \u201cI would love a drink.\u201d And then he leaned in for another kiss, the move more certain now, his hands on her more demanding and visceral, claiming her and marking her arms, her neck, her lips and ass with his hands, his touch, his caress.</p><p>She was his tonight, and that had to be enough for her. He was hers for whatever he gave, and as the kiss heated she felt her core warm, clit throbbing and eager for what his tongue was promising right now, exploring her as his hands roamed her back and neck.</p><p>People were staring now; as she opened her eyes the onlookers tittered. She pulled back and wiped her mouth, embarrassed.</p><p>Dylan just grinned, leaned in and said, \u201cLet\u2019s stop giving the jealous bastards a show.\u201d Her laughter rang down the street to the parking lot where his Audi sat.</p><p>When she climbed in it smelled like a campfire.</p><p>Blasting the local 80s station on the radio, they rode back to his place in silence, his hand planted on her knee whenever he wasn\u2019t shifting, the fingers playing a melody of lust and creeping higher up her thigh until they arrived at his apartment complex. It was a skyscraper made of glass and steel and it screamed money.</p><p>How in the hell did a firefighter afford this? As if he heard her thoughts, Dylan muttered, \u201cI have a roommate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Disappointment flooded her. Maybe he really did just want to have drinks? No guy ever, ever invited her to his place to share some vodka and Coke, though. Not even the true assholes who beer goggled their way to fucking a fat chick they despised in the morning.</p><p>Relief took over her disappointment when he smiled a wicked grin and said, \u201cBut he\u2019s gone for the night.\u201d</p><p>Getting out of the car, walking up two flights of stairs and wandering down Dylan\u2019s hallway was a blur. Laura vaguely heard his keys rattling and then a fierce, hot mouth was on hers, Dylan\u2019s thick forearms scraping her shoulders as his hands slid up her jawline, behind her ears, fingers nestling in her hair and pulling her blond curls loose.</p><p>His tongue explored her mouth with such precision and his hips pressed into hers with intent. Gasping, she inhaled sharply as he pushed her up against his open door and took her mouth greedily.</p><p>Without a word he maneuvered their entangled bodies, closed the front door, tossed his keys on the floor and had her in his bedroom in seconds. No complaints here, Laura thought, and that was the last rational idea she had as he went straight for her clit.</p><p>No pretense, no artsy coyness.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you \u2013 ?\u201d she gasped. And then, oh wow, he went right for the center of her heat, the briefest of touches so profound she nearly came all over his lips, in an instant. Her thong slid down her legs as if an unseen force stripped it off and then \u2013</p><p>\u201cAhhhhhh,\u201d she groaned, practiced arms reaching under her hips, establishing his power. Using his forearms, he guided himself to her clit, freeing one hand to touch her there, slipping a finger into her pussy and caressing so that it set off unexpected waves of pleasure.</p><p>It was like a dream come true. She had resigned herself to guys who went down on her like their Novocaine was wearing off. Lips flapping and trying to do one thing but accomplishing nothing more than drooling. Who was this man? This? This was like being made love to by a silk mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her body flushed red and hot, the fire focused on her hot nub as he teased it, slowly growing the release within, entering and pulling back with two perfect fingers. Her thighs twitched and shook, and she knew she would come like a freight train soon. She buried her hands in his hair, sinking her hands into him, pushing his face in tandem with her need to strum her to the next level \u2013</p><p>\u201cOh, Dylan!\u201d she murmured, fucking his tongue, which licked her, hard, dead centered on her nub. His tongue opened up, hot flesh on hers as he gave her focused and expansive flesh play. Two different sensations tipped her completely over as every muscle tensed, her dripping hole clinging to his finger, riding his face like a stallion, his tongue working hard to keep her frenzy going.</p><p>\u201cThere! Right there,\u201d she groaned, hands curling into fists of orgasm, body flailing as she murmured over and over, \u201cOh, God! Oh, God!\u201d She was self-conscious; most guys didn\u2019t just do this. They might flirt a bit with the clit, but they didn\u2019t engage so fully. So, uh, deeply. He clearly enjoyed this. Reveled in it. And as he picked some perfect rhythm for making her come, she realized she was being played by a sex virtuoso.</p><p>Give in to it, Laura. Give in, she told herself, hoping he didn\u2019t care about her fleshy belly, her curvy ass. All worry faded as she orgasmed and realized she had never thought this was possible, had never been in the hands of a master like this. Keeping her pussy on his tongue, he maintained, tongue pushing and withdrawing, getting every last bit, as her muscles unclenched, her gasps subsiding, little sounds of exertion fading into pants of disbelief and awe.</p><p>He looked up and grinned, sliding his hands up her body, following her curves. One hot kiss full of her taste geared her up again, her clit and pussy clenching so hard she climaxed yet again simply from the kiss, her hips pushing into him, her juices in her mouth, his mouth, the scent so arousing that she was actually coming from a kiss.</p><p>The taste of Laura was so much more detectable than anything they had just eaten at dinner. Instinct drove him to kiss her again and just as he was ready to make his next move she surprised him by taking the lead. She reached for him with a familiarity she had no right to, the skin on his aching cock so soft and eager, rising up to meet her and loving her boldness. Laura deftly massaged his thigh with her other hand, cupping his balls, pressing against the base with her thumb, a deep groan growing out of him unbidden. Oh, man, did this woman know how to touch him.</p><p>She licked her lips with intent, boldly staring him in the eye, then looking down and drawing out the wait, making him hold his breath with the agony of anticipation.</p><p>She held the base of his cock with one hand and began licking him slowly, flicking the tip until he groaned again, hoping he could hold out until they were ready to make love, his body so ready to dive into her flesh, to grab those curves and to luxuriate in her lush presence.</p><p>Taking him in inch by inch, she tongued him until he twitched. Licking the front of his cock below the head and then gulping him even deeper into her mouth, flicking her tongue against him, she made him tighten and release his breath, hips shifting as he moaned at the feel of her mouth around his cock.</p><p>Her hand gently masturbated him while sliding her mouth up on his cock, making sure he felt the inside of her cheek, her tongue and her lips, not really sucking but milking him. Milking him. Oh, shit, at this rate he\u2019d come in her mouth, and as seconds passed that idea became increasingly appealing...</p><p>One of his hands touched her head, stroking her hair encouragingly even as he struggled inside, fighting the pleasure she was draining from him, torn between wanting immediate release and craving the feeling of being in her.</p><p>Building up the speed almost excruciatingly slowly, she played him like a damned instrument, and as his fingers tightened in her hair her silky locks felt like another layer of possibility, her hair casual and comforting and just right \u2013 like everything else this night. She gently touched his balls and he felt his juices begin to ooze out into her mouth, so that she gasped even with his pole in her mouth, the combination of moist heat and cold, rushing air too much.</p><p>The sound of her voice vibrated his cock in her throat, her lips kissing her own thumb and forefinger, wrapped like a cock ring, was Dylan completely enveloped by her. Nearly screaming, he sat up and grasped her head, grinding his hips in and out as she sucked hard, then let go, in rhythm to get him off. She completely enveloped his root with her lips. He panted, overtaken by this gem, his hands roaming over her gorgeous breasts, her hair falling in waves over her face as she mouth fucked him, and the better part of him stopped her, wanting to give her more.</p><p>But holy hell, she was a master at this.</p><p>Second date, Dylan, he told himself. Second date.</p><p>Am I really giving head on the first date? Laura wondered, her mouth working the magic she knew she possessed. She was good at this. Really good. A fleeting thought, pretty girls don\u2019t need to do that, shot through her mind and she willed it away. Giving a blow job wasn\u2019t about being pretty enough.</p><p>It was about control.</p><p>And until Dylan had stopped her, she had him completely in her spell. And liked it.</p><p>His fingers sought out her arousal, discovering her wetness. \u201cI want you, Laura. I need to be in you,\u201d he murmured, her eyelids fluttering shut and her brain bending into a pretzel, twisted by a sudden lust, a lushness to his words, their presence, this now that made her want to immerse herself in Dylan forever.</p><p>You would think she would be sated from what he had done with that skilled tongue, but a new wave renewed within. She wanted every inch of him, however he was willing to give it. Laura needed to impale herself on him, to ride that shaft, to feel his body on top, to have his hands on her, in her, over her \u2013 whatever her \u2013 and she wanted to exert control once again, to be controlled, to just \u2013</p><p>Have more.</p><p>Shoving him on the bed, she put her legs on either side of his hips, the rasp of leg hair and flesh like music to her ears, his mere touch connecting her to a confidence she enjoyed. Aiming him carefully, she hovered over him, savoring the seconds, his eyes locked with hers, the skin around them warm and inviting, and she plunged herself directly over his gloriously-thick shaft. He was eager and pulsing, and she groaned when he went all the way in.</p><p>What she wanted to say was something profound, the right words to match what her body was screaming. Instead, she sighed, \u201cOh, Dylan,\u201d for the feeling was indescribable, a denouement, emotional and psychological, all at once. Like a real hole being filled, finding a being so strong it could fill it.</p> <p>She stretched up to his tip, sliding up his pole a sweet sensation, moving toward a screaming orgasm more amazing than any before. He licked one hand and stroked her nipple; he was spasming her pussy. Moving slightly, changing everything, she slid enough to make him beg, tightened her cunt, then plunged down again.</p><p>\u201cLaura,\u201d he groaned. \u201cYou have a magic pussy. You are so, so tight, so warm,\u201d he convulsed. She sighed, the feeling too intense. She didn\u2019t have a mind, just an ass he grabbed and nerve endings and her fullness.</p><p>He took charge, both standing now, bending her over the bed, tummy down. So many guys liked to fuck her this way; was it because she was so big? Did they enjoy the view of her curvy ass? Or \u2013 she pushed the negative thoughts away, for his hands roamed over her, owning her, telling her she was most wanted. One hand slid him in as he took her doggie style, his other hand in her hair. She reached for her clit as he dove into her, face buried in the bed.</p><p>She thrust back against his cock, the pleasure so insane, the force of his tip against her cervix making her scream. She clenched the bedsheets, her fists tightening, her finger finding her clit a swollen, hot mess ready to explode.</p><p>\u201cAh, GOD!\u201d Laura screamed and screamed and rutted, an animal of need as wetness hit her, knew she was spurting, felt him jerk and jizz, filling her with his semen, her pussy one big fuck bucket, as he screamed.</p><p>\u201cAh, Laura! Fuck me!\u201d He couldn\u2019t speak any longer; she stopped thinking and her body tried so much to come as hard as it could, her flesh determined to work with the magnitude of climax.</p><p>He pounded and pounded, she thrust back, he stroked her belly and created a tiny pain, the pain all blending with the creaming and the cum to split her voice into something fierce and low, until all that was left was a drained feeling, all sex and candy and heaven.</p><p>They came down, little aftershocks from the remainders of their sex, Dylan still in her as he melted into her, trapping her, their wetness all she knew. She stopped thinking; her pussy was done, her body relaxed, all sated.</p><p>\u201cOh, man...\u201d he mumbled into her back, hot breath ticklish and sweet.</p><p>She turned around and pressed into him. \u201cAnd that is how it should be,\u201d she replied, a wicked grin plastered across her face as she kissed him.</p><p>How long had they been asleep? Laura wondered as she peered into the grey darkness, Dylan\u2019s arm covering her bare breasts, the sheets tangled between them.</p><p>The post-coital haze lessened and reality sunk in. She realized that they were here in his apartment, and then it was \u2013 Oh, no!</p><p>When she checked her smart phone it read 3:22 a.m. What was the right thing to do? Should she stay? She looked down at this tender, precious, hot, naked man who had just devoured her in every way possible, and felt a giant rippling sense of guilt.</p><p>He seemed to be into her in this whole one night-stand thing. She was frankly accustomed to bringing the guy back to her place and then having the guy leave right after everything was over. So, this was new territory for her and she wasn\u2019t sure. Should she stay? Wake up early and make him breakfast?</p><p>As she looked around his bedroom, she started to notice pictures. Pictures of Dylan with a woman on the beach holding surfboards, a woman in a stringed bikini, and then another picture of the same woman in a sport bikini playing beach volleyball. Then another of what looked like the same woman standing at the ski slope along with another man, the guy wearing goggles and a helmet. Yet another picture of the same woman on the snowboard doing some sort of flip in mid air.</p><p>What the fuck? Her heart started to pound. This was all wrong. He was definitely \u2013 this was just some one night-stand. Was that his wife? His girlfriend? Who? Every insecurity flooded her, everything poured into her, and here she stood completely naked in the moonlight, staring over this guy who had just given her the best four hours she had had in years.</p><p>It was all a lie. A big, fat lie.</p><p>She scrambled to find her thong, her skirt, her sweater, her bra \u2013 where was it? Found it somewhere across the room hanging off of a doorknob of a closet.</p><p>Had they really been that, uh, acrobatic? Apparently. As the feelings all merged into one big bundle of sheer fright, she found herself flooded with shame \u2013 shame and despair. And most of all a massive adrenaline rush that just kept screaming, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out now.</p><p>She tiptoed, holding on to the straps of her heels, making sure she had her purse, her scrunchie pulling her hair together quickly so she didn\u2019t look quite as ridiculous as she felt as she handled the walk of shame, clicking the door as quietly as possible.</p><p>The hallway was empty as she tiptoed down the stairs in her stocking feet and then finally found herself outside in the cool night air, the streetlamps illuminating, indeed, her walk of shame back home. Fortunately, there were cabs floating around at 3:30 in the morning hour now and she grabbed one, completely ignoring every comment that the cabbie made, hoping like hell he could read the fact that she had leaned back against the bend of the backseat and closed her eyes, wanting to be left alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alone was safer.</p><p>Laura used every spare molecule of energy and focus to still her heart, to calm it back down to where it belonged, in the normal, boring, slow pace she\u2019d experienced before the whirlwind of Dylan. She should have known it was too good to be true. Every damn moment of it. He just wanted a piece of meat on the side. A big piece of meat. A little variety was the spice of life, right? Her body was so different from his girlfriend\u2019s, a sleek, muscled, athletic sculpting she couldn\u2019t imagine.</p><p>Damn, damn, damn, \u2013 here came the tears. They weren\u2019t the great big heaving sobs that she felt after dating someone for months and then realizing that it just wasn\u2019t working. This was more of the scalding tears of reproachment, of the fact that she should have known better, and of a bit of giddiness that she\u2019d gotten something more than she\u2019d expected out of the evening.</p><p>Dinner and mind-blowing sex was great, but apparently what she had had with him was all she was going to have, because he was clearly involved with whoever that woman was and that woman had a bod that went on for miles. Damn, if she had ten percent body fat, she\u2019d be amazed. If that was his type, what was Laura? Just some cow he decided he\u2019d grab onto for the hell of it, trolling some dating site. Whatever.</p> <p>The screech of the cab\u2019s brakes told her it was time and then boom \u2013 she felt the car jerk to a stop. She handed the cabbie enough of a tip to make herself feel good and to make him grin, and to wish her a good night, a good morning, a good whatever. As she headed up to her apartment her shoes vibrated like a gong, click, click, click, her legs propelling her on on very weak heels, very tired calves, very tired everything. Mind, body and soul.</p><p>She peeled off her outfit, poured herself into her big oversized flannel pajamas, and just crawled into bed to sleep the sleep of the conflicted.</p><p>Dylan was accustomed to waking alone, Jill\u2019s side of the bed a cold place, a sexual Siberia, but he had hoped to find Laura there this morning. Making her breakfast and having her be his breakfast had been on his mind as he\u2019d faded off to sleep, cradling her in his arms.</p><p>Hopefully, she\u2019d left a note. Maybe she needed to rush off to work. He understood. It was hard to juggle shifts and bosses and \u2013</p><p>His eyes stopped as they landed on a picture of Jill. Hawaii. About seven years ago. Her skin glistened in her wet suit and she grinned a relaxed, happy smile as the sun kissed her nose, Mike standing next to her, turned toward her and showing the camera only his profile, face largely hidden. He was a good foot taller than petite Jill. Their hair had lightened so much on that vacation, though Dylan\u2019s dark locks had stayed the same. By the end of the week Jill and Mike were hooked on surfing, while Dylan...</p> <p>His thoughts faded as the enormity of Jill\u2019s death hit him. In some ways, her death was still striking blows. Good ones. $59 million blows a year.</p><p>He, unlike Laura, would never have to worry about getting to work on time again. Man, even letting himself think like that made him queasy. It was a sick, sick way to become rich \u2013 losing your soulmate \u2013 and he was still so angry at something \u2013 God? Cancer? Fate? His own helplessness? \u2013 that he just wouldn\u2019t quit the fire station, preferring to act like a working class slob because until two months ago, that\u2019s exactly what, and who, he had been.</p><p>The masquerade of normalcy was important. Necessary. Especially now that he was dating Laura. Until he knew she cared for him as the old Dylan \u2013 before trust fund \u2013 he needed to play it cool.</p><p>Sitting up, he stretched his arms over his head, willing blood to flow into his biceps, triceps, popping his elbows and slowly stretching out his neck. His hips ached just a little, the good kind of ache from a nice, deep, intense session of lovemaking. He grinned, the smell of her still on his sheets, her soft skin nearly still there, brushing against his chest. Laura was soft and sweet and sighed like it was all some kind of dream, as if his touch were new. He\u2019d been tender with her, but detected a little something extra, a naughty streak. He\u2019d been right and reveled in the discovery.</p><p>If he texted her now would that be seen as too pushy? Too stalkerish?</p><p>Who cares.</p> <p>Grabbing his phone, he dug out her number and texted.</p><p>So you went home and all I got was this morning boner. ;)</p><p>Silence. Give it five minutes, Dylan, he told himself. Standing, he let the sunlight stream in through the window and wash over him, his naked form tight with need. A bottle of lotion and a nice hot shower could kill off his arousal. Even better, though, would be a date tonight.</p><p>Nothing. He knew it seemed way too desperate, but he looked up her number and dialed. No answer. Not even a voice mail message. That was supremely weird, because the only reason you couldn\u2019t leave a voice mail on someone\u2019s phone was if they blocked you.</p><p>Cold rushed through his body, his flesh covered with goosebumps in seconds. Blocked? Why would she block him? He took a really good look around the room and let himself inhale, then exhale, a few times. Centered, he thought carefully through the last twenty-four hours.</p><p>He had found her online. Asked her out. Scheduled a dinner at the hottest restaurant in town. Found her attractive and the feeling mutual. Made a move, invited her over, hand mind-blowing sex (which he wanted more of) and had fallen sleep spooned with her in his bed.</p><p>Waking up, he was alone. He texted her. He called her \u2013 and now it appeared she had blocked him.</p><p>Blocked?</p> <p>That had to be a mistake. He called again. It rang twenty-eight times before he hung up. Where was Mike? Oh, that\u2019s right \u2013 at his cabin. He had decided to clear out so Dylan could have alone time with Laura. Except now Dylan had tons of alone time \u2013 with himself. Not the kind of private time he was hoping for.</p><p>He popped on the computer and opened a chat window at the dating site. She wasn\u2019t in his \u201cFavorites\u201d any more. Huh? He ran a search \u2013 now Laura Michaels. It was as if she had vanished.</p><p>Blocked?</p><p>And, in fact, she had.</p><p>Beep-beep-beep! She whammed her hand on the alarm button, but it was elusive; a little too far out of her grasp, but instead she whacked the heel of her hand on the corner of her end table and listened to her own yelp of protests.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d She opened her eyes, giving the machine a glare meant to melt circuits. 6:00 a.m. \u2013 time for work. Really \u2013 had she really only gotten two and a half hours of sleep? Shit.</p><p>She stood up, forced herself to stretch and then wondered why she felt so sore, so sticky, so \u2013</p><p>Oh. Dylan\u2019s tongue on her clit, lapping in circles as his finger slid in and out, her legs on his shoulders and \u2013 That\u2019s why. She closed her eyes and sighed heavily, letting emotion wash over her and just feeling it, knowing that blocking it out, denying it, or pushing it aside would do her no good.</p><p>Let it be and it would fade. Force it away and she\u2019d carry the pain forever.</p><p>What she had thought might have been just wasn\u2019t meant to be, and she had to accept that. Too good to be true, really \u2013 the night was some sort of magical, very authentic encounter with a hot guy way out of her league.</p><p>But that was OK. It was OK. It was a new day and she reached for her smart phone, confirming the time and then seeing that she had about twenty-seven texts from Josie, and she\u2019d have to answer those later. Josie would make her spill everything, tell all, and would congratulate her for refusing to accept second best.</p><p>Right now, though, Laura needed to wallow. And that, like so much else, was OK.</p><p>Her coffeemaker gurgled, the tell-take signs that the pot was just about finished. She had forgotten that before the date she\u2019d set it all up just like she always did, had come home from work and set up the coffee for the next day. She was grateful as she sloshed the coffee into her mug and sat down, booting up her computer to check email, today like any other morning, although, she knew deep inside it really wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan.</p><p>Laura popped into her email, ignored a bunch of ads, found nothing of real value in there until suddenly she noticed that the online dating site had sent her a message. \u201cYou have a new request to chat.\u201d Yep \u2013 boom, boom, boom, boom. A hugely full inbox.</p><p>She had seventeen new requests to chat. Yeah, right \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t be chat requests, but rather fuck requests. Thanks, guys, I\u2019m all chatted out and my fuck request meter is broken.</p><p>She knew it was fine, deep down \u2013 last night was all that she needed. That\u2019s what she wanted \u2013 she wanted more of last night. The magic. The thrill. Being charmed and charming someone back. Falling into that special knowing and feeling warm and safe and excited all at once, the heady passion of the new.</p><p>And then the image of the pictures all over Dylan\u2019s room filled her brain, that woman, his girlfriend, his wife, his whatever. He didn\u2019t wear a ring, but that didn\u2019t mean anything. She had learned that within her second or third date after college. The married men always lied and they tended to be the slickest \u2013 and this guy was pretty slick. Laura took a deep breath and \u2013 and it almost tasted like he was in her, as if his scent had permeated her lungs, as if it coated her trachea, as if \u2013</p><p>Inhale. Exhale. She breathed in, she breathed out \u2013 breathed in sadness, breathed out happiness, breathed in sorrow, breathed out joy. No matter how hard she tried, though, it wasn\u2019t cutting it. Caffeine would have to do what meditation could not, no matter what her yoga teacher said about the evils of coffee. You can pry my caffeine from my cold, dead, outstretched hand.</p><p>She sucked down the cup of coffee, poured herself another and thought what the hell and clicked on one of those chat messages in email. Hmmm. Hey there, Mike, she thought to herself. Some guy named Mike wanted to meet or wanted to chat with her. Mike \u2013 let\u2019s see, he\u2019s 32, 6\u20185\u201d, 180. Sounded like a runner. Online dating was devolving into ordering from a menu. Would you like fries with that?</p><p>There it was: \u201clikes to run marathons and works at a ski resort.\u201d Oh, dear \u2013 her idea of running was waving madly at the bus driver and sprinting when she was late for the morning bus, and skiing? Lodge. Hot toddy. Not snow.</p><p>Deleting his message would have been the easiest thing in the world, and her finger even hovered over the button, but something stopped her. If Josie had been there and asked, Laura couldn\u2019t have explained it. She just...stopped. Clicking to his profile, she read up on him. He looked kind of like the mirror opposite of Dylan. This guy had sandy blonde hair and Nordic features while Dylan was Italian and dark and swarthy. Mike looked long and lean in pictures of him riding a bike, shots of him crossing finish lines, and pictures of him camping.</p><p>Camping. She shuddered. Her idea of camping was no mint on the pillow. She wasn\u2019t sure this was going to work. And then she read his little intro about himself:</p><p>\u201cHi, my name is Mike Pine, I am 32 years old. I am really new to this online dating thing. I am very active and athletic, work at a ski resort, I teach skiing and also work on the first aid team. In my spare time, I like to run and camp and bike, and I\u2019m looking for friendship or more, whatever and would like to chat with other people who are interested in the same thing \u2013 \u201d</p><p>Beep-blip! A little chat window popped up and Laura splashed coffee on her hand in surprise at the unexpected sound. \u201cOw!\u201d she shouted, grabbing a kitchen towel and shaking it out. \u201cWhat the hell!?\u201d She peered at the now lit-up screen, a familiar chat window open in the right lower-hand corner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, geez,\u201d she sputtered, her words echoing through her empty apartment. Somehow he had figured out she was online, \u2018cause this was a chat from Marathon Mike himself.</p><p>\u201cHi, there. Are you on right now?\u201d he wrote. Oh, God, she still had the smell of Dylan on her and now she had some new guy coming after her? What a slut she was. She thought about that for a second. The word slut didn\u2019t really apply to her, ever. It was more that she was trying on new behaviors.</p><p>Let\u2019s try this one on for size, she thought.</p><p>She typed back, \u201cI\u2019m just drinking my coffee and getting ready for work and I logged in and saw your message, so hi!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, good morning! Yeah, I\u2019m not really functional without two or three cups of coffee myself,\u201d he wrote back with a little grin icon.</p><p>Hmph...yeah who isn\u2019t, she thought.</p><p>Laura chugged the rest of her mug\u2019s contents and typed, one-handed, \u201cSo I see you\u2019re like, Mr. Triathlon and ski dude, and my idea of exercise is walking across the room to get the remote.\u201d</p><p>He wrote back, \u201clolol, yeah don\u2019t be afraid, we could just go for a hike if you want. Oh, I think I just asked you out. Yeah I did,\u201d and then he ended it with a question mark.</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d she muttered. She stared at the glowing screen, dumbfounded, her empty coffee mug dangling precariously off her right index finger as she absorbed this. What was this? Did she hit the good-looking guy lottery? Out of the blue, she just \u2013 oh, she had just totally ditched Dylan in his bed last night, and now she had some guy who looked an awful lot like the lankier version of the actor who played Thor hitting on her, but deep inside she decided she was trying on this new act, and she would just go for it.</p> <p>Just go for it, Laura. What can it hurt? A swell of physical memory from last night made her warm between her legs, made her skin flush with the recall of Dylan\u2019s hands. She wanted more. And if she couldn\u2019t have more of him, she might as well have some of Mike.</p><p>\u201cA hike yeah, I\u2019d like that. That sounds really cool.\u201d And she breathed in opportunity, and breathed out rejection, breathed in despondence, and exhaled chance.</p><p>Chance favors the prepared. Laura was more than ready.</p><p>At least, that\u2019s what she told herself.</p><p>Continued in part 2, Her Second Billionaire..</p><p>A sample:</p> <p>SHE DREW A LINE WITH A ONE NIGHT STAND</p><p>When Laura Michaels got one hot firefighter pinging her for a date after joining a popular online dating service, she thought she had won the lottery. A night with Dylan Stanwyck, professional (firefighting) hunk and former model, had been too much. Fearful her curves would turn him off like so many other guys, her pleasant surprise turned to white-hot passion as she broke her own rule and slept with him on the first date.</p><p>That turned to regret when she awoke in the wee hours of the morning and found pictures of a hot, buff surfer-type woman with Dylan plastered all over his bedroom. Taking the hint, she made the walk of shame home, deleted him from her contacts and chalked it up to experience.</p><p>To her shock, within hours a new guy \u2013 Mike Pine, a ski instructor and marathon runner with a body and face like an actor in a superhero movie \u2013 messaged her and asked her out. Lightning struck twice in 24 hours! Laura was incredulous but, emboldened by encouragement from her best friend, Josie, she took the plunge and accepted the date.</p><p>HE WANTS TO BE LOVED ON HIS OWN</p><p>Mike likes simple things. Skiing. Running. Being outside. Uncomplicated love. Good food. For nearly ten years he, Dylan and Jill had a simple love that was achingly easy on the inside, and oh, so complicated from the outside. It worked, though, and made him whole \u2013 until Jill\u2019s lymphoma diagnosis and her early death.</p><p>Reeling, he and Dylan just took their lives day by day, and sometimes hour by hour, mourning their great love. Broken, Mike descended into a world of punishing athleticism, clocking 14-hour days on the slopes and 100+ miles of running a week, the pounding of his legs on pavement strong enough \u2013 he wished \u2013 to pound out his pain. What he and Dylan had never expected was what came more than a year after Jill\u2019s death: an inheritance. From her family\u2019s trust fund. More than $1 billion each, with a perpetual income that made everything go from simple to chaotic.</p><p>What Laura doesn\u2019t know is that Dylan and Mike are roommates. More than roommates. And they are looking for a third in their relationship. More than a third...but Mike has something to prove, first, and snagging this first date with her is just the beginning.</p> <p>Read on to sample Her Second Billionaire:</p><p>Had she really just made a date less than three hours after sneaking out of another guy\u2019s bed? She opened up one of the 17 texts from Josie which, as she scrolled through them, appeared to all be variations of, \u201cPlease tell me about the hot guy.\u201d</p><p>So she finally decided to put Josie out of her misery and typed out, \u201cHey. Awesome night. Will tell you the deets later,\u201d hit \u201cSend\u201d and almost instantly got back a response.</p><p>What do you mean later? Hell, no. I\u2019m coming over.</p><p>She wrote back:</p><p>Can\u2019t. I\u2019m late for work as it is. Let\u2019s just say I need a shower this morning.</p><p>and hit send.</p><p>Squeeeee</p><p>was Josie\u2019s reply. Do you have another date?</p><p>Do I have another date? Oh yeah Josie, I have another date. It\u2019s just not with the same guy. Ugh, how was she going to tell her this? God, she, she needed two showers. One to wash off Dylan and the other one to wash off her own skank.</p><p>This was getting ridiculous. She typed back:</p><p>There\u2019s a lot to this. Will write more later. Come over after work.</p><p>She hit \u201cSend\u201d and just turned her phone over, leaving Josie hanging, and padded into the shower. Indeed, it was time to wash off Dylan and her own... er... her own sense of ambiguity? Indecision? Disappointment?</p><p>Revelation? For she had learned so much these past few days, mostly about herself. In some ways, she was surprised to realize, it didn\u2019t matter that Dylan was with someone else. In the past, that would have crushed her, but now \u2013 now she felt a renewed sense of power. Of strength. Stripping down and turning up the temperature on the shower\u2019s spray, she felt her body melt into the hot water, the sting of the jets tearing her away from her looping thoughts, putting the focus back on her body. Rivulets of water streamed over her breasts, down her belly, with its gentle curves and lush skin, pooling at her V and sliding down her thighs, a familiar heat rushing into her womanhood.</p><p>It may have been only a few hours since she\u2019d left his bed, but his mark really was on her. Closing her eyes, she remembered his touch and felt an incongruous sense of guilt. Guilt? He\u2019s the one who had a girlfriend or wife? Yet here she was, scheduling a date with a stranger hours after having Dylan in her. On her. All over her.</p><p>The detachable shower head was about to earn its keep. She knew exactly where to aim it, her hands practiced when it came to masturbating. All her normal fantasies, though, weren\u2019t cutting it \u2013 not the dream about Jake Gyllenhaal, or Matt Bomer, or even Zach Braff. Instead, her mind drifted to Dylan. And Mike.</p><p>As she parted her labia and zeroed the jet spray on her clit, she fought the image of Dylan. And Mike! Both? Yet nothing made it go away. Her body responded to the mere idea of it, of both of them at once, of four hands, two mouths, two cocks all focused on her. Laura. On her needs, on her pleasure, on her discovery. Ahhhhh...</p><p>This was crazy! She hadn\u2019t even met Mike yet. Had crawled out of Dylan\u2019s bed just a few hours ago, resolved never to see him again. Why was she letting them dominate her fantasies? She still had Dylan\u2019s juices in her, his saliva dried on her, his kiss and skin and lips all \u2013 well, now that the water washed the night away, that wasn\u2019t really true, but her neck tightened as her breasts swelled, her hands holding the shower spray in one hand, centered straight on her clit now, her other hand parting her labia and two fingers slowly entering her, the balance hard to achieve but easier as she propped one foot up on the edge of the tub and leaned back against the shower wall.</p><p>Her fingers encountered slightly sore flesh, her mouth spreading with an unexpected grin as she recognized why it hurt a bit, why the water\u2019s sting was so bittersweet. Ah, Dylan \u2013 he had been thick and huge and gentle and rough all at once, knowing exactly how to press her skin, tweak her tight spots, play her body to perfect orgasm over and over with his tongue, his lips, his fingers, his hands, and that gorgeous, veined cock.</p><p>Now she had a face for her menage fantasies \u2013 Mike\u2019s. Why not? Live a little, Laura. No one knew what went on in the privacy of her own mind, her own shower, and as she sighed deeply, the pressure of everything vanquished, she felt a familiar heat and bliss rise up in her as the water pulsed its way into her soul, her clit crying out for more, her fingers sliding in and out of her tight pussy not in a heated rush but, instead, slowly, stroking that spot on the top that always made her clench just a tad harder, made her breath hitch, made her imagine it was Mike\u2019s fingers in her, Dylan\u2019s tongue strumming her clit, both men eager and ready to enter her at once.</p><p>\u201cMmmmm,\u201d Mike moaned in her ear, his thick, wiry runner\u2019s body sliding next to hers in the shower, beads of water darkening that blonde hair, toned arms lifting her up and plunging her down on his ready cock. And then \u2013 was that Dylan\u2019s mouth on her ass? Then gently parting her cheeks as Mike lifted her, had her straddle him across the waist as he effortlessly held her in place, strong legs bending slightly so Dylan could...</p><p>She snaked her pinkie finger down so it played with her puckered anus, the mere touch of her fingertip on her perineum enough to tip her over, imagining Dylan filling her, double entry almost too kinky to even let herself dream about.</p><p>\u201cAh, God, Laura, more,\u201d Dylan groaned behind her, his cock inching slowly inside her ass, Mike\u2019s tip pushing hard against her cervix, her body entombed between them as the water sprayed down. When Dylan\u2019s mouth found her earlobe she \u2013</p><p>Exploded. The shower head, her pinkie finger on her anus, her fingers exploring her g-spot, and her dream all combined to make her bend down and scream as a mad rush of orgasm pounded her instantly, no warning, no teasing, just a wall of everything that left her gaping, her mouth open and her throat hoarse as she let it all unleash, her shoulders twitching and bashing into the wall, her hands moving and milking this for everything she could find, her mind filled with images of Dylan and Mike simulfucking her, their faces strained and cumming, too, all from her. Her body, her presence \u2013 her.</p><p>And then \u2013 nothing. Like a switch flipped, she pulled her hands out of all her orifices, turned the shower head off, washed up fast and got ready for work. Sated, but not distracted, she shifted from horny, bewildered single on the dating scene to Business Analyst for the megacorporation.</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t last more than a few minutes, for she knew her mind would wander, soon. For now, though, it was a welcome and much-needed break.</p><p>Mike had no idea what he was supposed to say as he stared at the chat window. This was so out of his element and Laura seemed so out of his league, but he knew he needed to do something. He couldn\u2019t let Dylan be the one in charge of yet another woman. They were supposed to share her \u2013 that was the entire plan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So he typed, \u201clolol, yeah don\u2019t be afraid, we could just go for a hike if you want. Oh, I think I just asked you out. Yeah I did,\u201d and then he ended it with a question mark.</p><p>And when she typed \u201cYes,\u201d he couldn\u2019t believe it \u2013 and panicked. Now he actually had to step forward. Dylan had always gone out and found the women and had been the one to find Jill, and no matter how desperately they both missed Jill, Jill was gone and they had to accept that.</p><p>Laura was pretty much the opposite of Jill, but he could see what Dylan saw in her. That was a sweet smile. She seemed accomplished, and there was something Mike couldn\u2019t put his finger on, a genuineness and authenticity, but he and Dylan were not exactly the most conventional package.</p><p>So he worried that maybe a business analyst at Stohlman Industries wasn\u2019t going to make the cut \u2013 or maybe he was more worried that they wouldn\u2019t make the cut with her. The office cubicle type wasn\u2019t exactly eager to go out on the slopes or to even watch him at mile marker 20 during a marathon, in his experience.</p> <p>But Dylan was giving it a good try and Mike had to, too. The problem was that Mike had to do it in secret. He typed in a few more words, they scheduled the hike, and then she disappeared, off to whatever corporate job she had in whatever floor of whatever giant skyscraper downtown. That world was so alien to him; he worked at a ski resort, and in fact he was missing it already.</p><p>You don\u2019t work there anymore, a voice inside him said. You own it...</p><p>The season hadn\u2019t started yet, but he looked forward to it. He always did every year and when he wasn\u2019t skiing he was running. Between the two he kept his sanity somehow, for over the years he had learned that the endorphin kick that came from running and from the massive double diamond trails in the winter were what he needed most. Jill had fit in nicely with his life and with Dylan\u2019s life, spending time running with him. Man, was she an ace on the slopes, too.</p><p>She and Dylan had an affinity for action movies, for cooking and...he let himself get nostalgic, even let his eyes well up with tears. Letting the memories flood him was dangerous, his mind tipping over from nostalgia to deep grief, a mourning he\u2019d only recently been able to emerge from, the slam of Jill\u2019s inheritance making him ache all over again.</p><p>His body was consumed suddenly by grief at her loss. It hadn\u2019t been running, it hadn\u2019t been skiing, it hadn\u2019t been any of Dylan\u2019s crazy antics like sky diving or parasailing that had killed Jill.</p> <p>It had been one cell that mutated and mutated and mutated until finally it had taken over her body, the lymphoma wasting her away and neither of them had gotten over her death from eighteen months ago. In some ways Mike had gotten over Jill even faster than Dylan, though Dylan had been the first to go out and find somebody to sleep with. Mike hadn\u2019t \u2013 he just hadn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Eighteen months, though. It had been a long dry spell and he was getting frustrated. Now he finally felt emotionally ready to at least give this a try, and he was more than physically ready. Who knew what the hike would bring? All he knew was that he had to try, and he had to try on his own. He couldn\u2019t be the tag along with Dylan. That had complicated their relationship with Jill for far too long. And it wasn\u2019t until it was too late that Mike realized that it actually hadn\u2019t mattered. He had loved Jill. Jill had loved him and they both loved Dylan. And the three of them had made it work, somehow, in their own crazy way.</p><p>Now the question was, could the three of them \u2013 this time with Laura \u2013 make it work? He was getting ahead of himself. All that mattered was having one hike with the woman. He just needed to see if this could be his future \u2013 their future.</p><p>Huff, huff, huff. Laura was more out of shape then she\u2019d ever imagined. Her idea of exercise was lifting her hand from her mouth to the bag of Doritos or lifting the spoon out of the pint of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s. No, she chided herself, that wasn\u2019t really true. She took the stairs at work, and that wasn\u2019t a joke, considering the fact that she worked on the 32nd floor. And she and Josie power-walked around her neighborhood (Josie jokingly called it their Mugging Prevention Program), but this kind of sustained prolonged, effort that used muscles that involved the hard work of climbing actual inclines while hiking along the trails and the woods? This she wasn\u2019t used to.</p><p>And that was OK. Really. Mike was a sweetheart who slowed his pace down and who was absolutely, fantastically interesting. Talking about everything from books that Laura hadn\u2019t read since college, but had always loved, to movies \u2013 who knew he had a Christopher Guest obsession, too? She couldn\u2019t wait for a second date where they could sit and watch Best in Show, and she could enjoy having that someone finally who appreciated the humor.</p><p>She was getting ahead of herself.</p> <p>And she really liked that.</p><p>\u201cLaura, are you OK?\u201d Mike asked, a look of concern covering his face as she wheezed slightly while rounding a bend and staring at the tall hill leading to the summit.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she lied. \u201cJust not used to these tall hills. I\u2019m, you know, more accustomed to doing eleven street blocks downtown. I\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and stared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re a good sport, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be. I don\u2019t think I have the oxygen to run away.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed in unison and Laura felt a warmth spreading through her. She couldn\u2019t quite believe the way that the past two days had gone. First, she\u2019d had an absolutely amazing date with Dylan. She could still feel him on her skin, even though she had slunk out of his apartment doing a walk of shame like she wouldn\u2019t believe. Then again, it wasn\u2019t exactly her fault that he had pictures of his current girlfriend all over the place. And now here was this golden boy, smiling at her and standing there like Thor at the gates of Asgard, taking her on a hike.</p><p>Mike was about as opposite of Dylan as you could possibly get. Tall \u2013 if he was shorter than 6\u20185\u201d she\u2019d be surprised \u2013 blonde, maybe Danish, with piercing blue eyes and the lanky body of a thirty-something guy who walked like he was seventeen and still a little awkward. Just looking at his body told her he was a true athlete, and he had told her himself he was a ski instructor, so obviously he was coordinated. She, on the other hand, felt like a giant cotton ball right now. A sweaty, huffing cotton ball. Who wanted nothing more than to relax in a hammock with a pitcher of sangrias.</p><p>And an oxygen tank.</p> <p>Yet here she was, about a quarter mile from the summit of some crazy-ass hill that he wanted her to climb to the top of. She could expand her horizons. This was something new. He was sweet, quiet, kind of taciturn \u2013 but not in a bad way. Nothing was awkward. Nothing was uncomfortable. He was just was a man who didn\u2019t talk too much. He preferred, obviously, to act, to move \u2013 to move up that damn hill. Which she now stared at as if she were looking at the top of Mount Everest.</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re really going to climb up that?\u201d she asked, trying to keep the skepticism out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cYep, we really are!\u201d he grinned. \u201cBut,\u201d he patted the log next to him where he\u2019d sat down, stretching out his long legs. \u201cWe can take a short break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA short break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, a long break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d she said, collapsing on the log next to him, trying to suck in her belly at the same time as her hamstrings cried out in relief.</p><p>Laura suddenly felt like a complete ass. Not exactly experienced with dates like this, she\u2019d overdressed and now, many miles into this hike, she was dripping with sweat, her hair limp and plastered against the edges of her face, her body flushed with the heat and the exertion of this long hike of this crazy tall hill. She felt about as feminine as a wet tissue and yet that kernel of woman in her did have a spark of femininity, because she was responding to Mike in ways that shocked her.</p><p>Her body should have been spent from the night with Dylan. But rather than finding herself halting or tentative, it was as if what she had done with Dylan the night before had opened her up like a flower blossoming, giving permission to show its true colors and to spread itself in full glory and right now, Laura was ready to spread herself again.</p><p>Easy, girl, she told herself as she stole another look at Mike.</p><p>What was it about these two? Dylan was incredible last night and yet she\u2019d already crossed him off her mental list of eligible partners because the guy obviously had a girlfriend or wife. Who keeps the pictures of some gorgeous woman all over the place in their bedroom otherwise? So less than fifteen hours after sneaking out of Dylan\u2019s house and doing the walk of shame, she found herself with yet another incredibly hopeful relationship staring her in the face.</p><p>Literally. She looked up and realized that Mike was watching her, his head cocked to the side, a little half grin making him look boyish and absolutely adorable. \u201cWhat are you thinking, Laura?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d she stammered, completely unwilling to tell him what she was really thinking. \u201cOh, I was just marveling at how beautiful it is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s amazing isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you work here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, in the winter, but I just thought I\u2019d bring you up here on a hike right now, because the canyon looks so much better. Different \u2013 when it\u2019s not covered with snow and skiers. Actually it\u2019s kind of nice to be here when I\u2019m not on duty and worrying about some teenager who breaks a leg or some eight year old who can\u2019t grab the tow rope properly and gets dragged up the hill.\u201d He chuckled and she joined him. That was the most she had heard out of his mouth in one continuous stretch since she\u2019d met him.</p><p>He just seemed so good-natured, he didn\u2019t talk much, was kind of quiet and she liked that. It was really different from Dylan, who was so gregarious, open and extroverted. There was a quiet depth to Mike that she found refreshing. Most guys she\u2019d met on the dating site were either out for a piece of ass or out to just sit there on a date and talk themselves up. Nobody had ever asked her out on a hiking date and she was starting to realize that this guy was different, this guy was special, and she hoped she was special enough for him.</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d he said, grabbing her arm suddenly, the pressure of his fingers more urgent than arousing. \u201cLook!\u201d he hissed, pointing into the woods. She leaned into him, craning her head to see what he was pointing to. She could smell him this close and he smelled like pine and sweat and something more \u2013 a sporty musk that seemed to turn on her inner sensors, making her instantly flushed, a lump forming in her throat that told her that there was definitely a spark of chemistry here.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThere \u2013 do you see it?\u201d Two deer stood deep in the woods munching on the bark of a tree. The mother perked her head up, turned to her fawn, and looked back at Laura and Mike with a precision only animals could possess. The doe nudged her baby and the two ran off into the woods.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d Laura said. \u201cThat\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The pressure of his fingers lightened, shifting from a grab of urgency to a lingering touch that asked a question his mouth couldn\u2019t \u2013 or wouldn\u2019t \u2013 ask. Two seconds, Laura, she told herself, two seconds to just start to breathe before turning and looking at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>When she turned, body perked like the doe\u2019s, heightened by animal instinct, he saw it in his eyes, too, as Mike leaned down and took her lips with his. </p>  </body></html>"]
