Christmas in the city\u2014any city\u2014was the epitome of commercialism, and San Francisco was no exception. Here it was, barely December, and department-store windows had been filled with automated elves and tinsel-hung Christmas trees since before Thanksgiving!</p><p>Most annoying, in Greg\u2019s opinion, was the hustle and bustle of holiday shoppers, all of whom seemed to be unnaturally cheerful. That only made his own mood worse.</p> <p>He wouldn\u2019t be in the city at all if he wasn\u2019t desperately in need of a bank loan. Without it, he\u2019d be forced to lay off what remained of his crew by the end of the year. He\u2019d have to close the winery\u2019s doors. His vines\u2014and literally decades of work\u2014had been wiped out by fan leaf disease, devastating the future of his vineyard and crippling him financially.</p><p>He\u2019d spent the morning visiting one financial institution after another. Like a number of other growers, he\u2019d applied at the small-town banks in the Napa Valley and been unsuccessful. His wasn\u2019t the only vineyard destroyed by the disease\u2014although, for reasons no one really understood, certain vineyards had been spared the blight. For a while there\u2019d been talk of low-interest loans from the federal government, but they hadn\u2019t materialized. Apparently the ruin hadn\u2019t been thorough enough to warrant financial assistance. For Greg that news definitely fell into the category of cold comfort.</p><p>It left him in a dilemma. No loan\u2014no replanted vines. Without the vines there would be no grapes, without the grapes, no wine, and without the winery, no Gregory Bennett.</p><p>What he needed after a morning such as this, he decided, was a good stiff drink and the company of a charming female companion, someone who could help him forget his current troubles. He walked into the St. Francis, the elegant San Francisco hotel, and found himself facing a twenty-foot Christmas tree decorated with huge gold balls and plush red velvet bows. Disgusted, he looked away and hurried toward the bar.</p><p>The bartender seemed to sense his urgency. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d he asked promptly. He wore a name tag that identified him as Don.</p> <p>Greg sat down on a stool. \u201cGet me a martini,\u201d he said. If it hadn\u2019t been so early in the day, he would have asked for a double, but it was barely noon and he still had to drive home. He didn\u2019t feel any compelling reason to return. The house, along with everything else in his life, was empty. Oh, the furniture was all there\u2014Tess hadn\u2019t taken that\u2014but he was alone, more alone than he could ever remember being.</p><p>Tess, his third and greediest wife, had left him six months earlier. The attorneys were fighting out the details of their divorce, and at three hundred dollars an hour, neither lawyer had much incentive to rush into court.</p><p>Nevertheless, Tess was gone. He silently toasted eliminating her from his life and vowed not to make the mistake of marrying again. Three wives was surely sufficient evidence that he wasn\u2019t the stay-married kind.</p><p>Yet he missed Tess, he mused with some regret\u2014and surprise. Well, maybe not Tess exactly, but a warm body in his bed. By his side. Even at the time, he\u2019d known it was foolish to marry her. He certainly should have known, after the messy end of his second marriage. His first had lasted ten years, and he\u2019d split with Jacquie over... Hell if he could remember. Something stupid. It\u2019d always been something stupid.</p><p>\u201cYou out shopping?\u201d Don the bartender asked as he delivered a bowl of peanuts.</p><p>Greg snorted. \u201cNot on your life.\u201d</p> <p>The younger man smiled knowingly. \u201cAh, you\u2019re one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean someone who\u2019s got common sense. What is it with people and Christmas? Normal, sane human beings become sentimental idiots.\u201d A year ago, when he and Tess had been married less than eighteen months, she\u2019d made it clear she expected diamonds for Christmas. Lots of them. She\u2019d wanted him to make her the envy of her friends. That was what he got for marrying a woman nineteen years his junior. A pretty blonde with a figure that could stop traffic. Next time around he\u2019d simply move the woman into his house and send her packing when he grew bored with her. No more marriages\u2014not for him. He didn\u2019t need any more legal entanglements.</p><p>Just then a blond beauty entered the bar, and Greg did a double take. For half a heartbeat, he thought it was Tess. Thankfully he was wrong. Blond, beautiful and probably a bitch. The last part didn\u2019t bother him, though\u2014especially now, when he could use a little distraction. He\u2019d be sixty-one his next birthday, but he was trim and fit, and still had all his hair\u2014gone mostly gray, what people called \u201cdistinguished.\u201d In fact, he could easily pass for ten years younger. His good looks had taken him a long way in this world, and he\u2019d worked hard to maintain a youthful appearance.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d he greeted her, swerving around on his stool to give her his full attention.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>Her answering smile told him she wasn\u2019t averse to his company. Yes, she might well provide a distraction. If everything worked out, he might stay in town overnight. Considering the morning he\u2019d had, he deserved a little comfort. He wasn\u2019t interested in anything serious\u2014just a light flirtation to take his mind off his troubles, a dalliance to momentarily distract him.</p><p>\u201cAre you meeting someone?\u201d Greg asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she said, her voice sultry and deep.</p> <p>Greg noted the packages. \u201cBeen shopping, I see.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and when the bartender walked over to her table, Greg said, \u201cPut it on my tab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said in that same sultry voice. He was even more impressed when she asked for a glass of Bennett Wine. A pinot noir.</p><p>He slipped off the stool and approached her table. \u201cI\u2019m Greg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCherry Adams.\u201d</p><p>He liked her name; it suited her. \u201cDo you mind if I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. Why not?\u201d</p><p>The day was already looking brighter. He pulled out a chair and sat down. They made small talk for a few minutes, exchanged pleasantries. He didn\u2019t mention his last name because he didn\u2019t want her to make the connection and have their conversation weighed down by the problems at Bennett Wines. However, it soon became clear that she was knowledgeable about wine\u2014and very flattering about his 1996 pinot noir. Tess had been an idiot on the subject, despite being married to the owner of a winery. She didn\u2019t know the difference between chablis and chardonnay. And she never did understand why he couldn\u2019t call his own sparkling wine champagne, no matter how many times he told her the name could only be used for sparkling wines from the Champagne region of France.</p><p>After another glass of wine for her and a second martini for him, Greg suggested lunch. Cherry hesitated and gazed down at her hands. \u201cSorry, but I\u2019ve got a nail appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could cancel it,\u201d Greg suggested, trying to hint that they could find more entertaining ways to occupy themselves. He didn\u2019t want her to think he was being pushy. Later, after lunch, he\u2019d surprise her and announce who he really was. He was pleased\u2014no, delighted\u2014by her interest in him, particularly because she didn\u2019t know he was the man responsible for the wine she\u2019d described as \u201cexquisite.\u201d He grinned; wait till he told her. Cherry\u2019s interest proved what he\u2019d been telling himself ever since Tess had walked out on him. He was still young, still vital, still sexy.</p><p>That was when it happened.</p><p>The look that crossed Cherry\u2019s face conveyed her thoughts as clearly as if she\u2019d said them aloud. She wasn\u2019t interested. Oh, sure, he was good for a few drinks, especially since he was buying. Good for an hour of conversation. But that was all.</p><p>\u201cI really do have to go,\u201d Cherry said as she reached for her shopping bags. \u201cMy nails are a mess. Thanks for the, uh, company and the wine, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Greg muttered, watching her leave. He was still reeling from the blow to his pride.</p><p>Soon afterward, he left, too. He\u2019d never been one to take rejection well, mainly because he\u2019d had so little experience of it.</p><p>After two martinis he knew he wasn\u2019t in any condition to drive. So he left his car in the lot and started to walk. With no destination in mind, he wandered down the crowded street, trying to keep his distance from all those happy little shoppers. His stomach growled and his head hurt, but not nearly as much as his ego. Every time he thought about the look on Cherry\u2019s face, he cringed. Okay, okay, she\u2019d been too young. At a guess he\u2019d say she was no more than thirty.</p><p>However, Greg knew a dozen women her age who would leap at the opportunity to spend a day and a night with him. He was suave, sophisticated and rich. Not as rich as he\u2019d once been\u2014would be again, as soon as he got this latest mess straightened out. If he got it straightened out. The truth was, he stood on the brink of losing everything.</p><p>Desperate to escape his dark thoughts, he began to walk at a brisker pace. He made an effort not to think, not to acknowledge his fears and worries, concentrating, instead, on the movement of his feet, the rhythm of his breath. He turned corner after corner and eventually found himself on a side street dominated by an imposing brick church.</p><p>He paused in front of it. A church. Now that was a laugh. He remembered how his mother had dragged him and his brother, Phil, to service every Sunday. He\u2019d even attended services while he was in college. But he hadn\u2019t darkened the door of a church since...Catherine.</p><p>She\u2019d been his sweetheart, his lover, during college\u2014until he\u2019d broken it off. No, abandoned her. That was a more honest description of what he\u2019d done. The years had numbed his guilt, and he rarely thought of her anymore. Funny how a relationship that had ended more than thirty-five years ago could suddenly rise up to haunt him. He\u2019d been a senior the last time he\u2019d seen Catherine. They\u2019d been madly in love. Then she\u2019d told him she was pregnant and Greg had panicked. About to graduate, about to start his life, he\u2019d done what had seemed sensible at the time; he\u2019d fled.</p><p>Unable to face her, he\u2019d written Catherine a letter and told her he was leaving. She should do whatever she wanted about the baby. It\u2019d been cowardly of him, but he was just a kid back then; he\u2019d long since stopped berating himself over it. He\u2019d never heard from her again. He didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d done about the baby. Didn\u2019t want to know. Abortions hadn\u2019t been legal at the time, but there were ways of getting rid of an unwanted pregnancy even then. His mother hadn\u2019t ever learned why his relationship with Catherine had ended, but Phil knew. That was the beginning of the estrangement between Greg and his brother.</p><p>Almost without realizing it, Greg began to move up the church steps. He blamed it on the throng of shoppers crowding in around him. All he wanted was a few moments of peace and quiet. A chance to think.</p><p>He hesitated on the top step. He didn\u2019t belong in a church, not the way he\u2019d lived. And yet...</p><p>His life was empty and he was old enough to recognize that. But at sixty, it was a bit late. For most of his adult life, he\u2019d followed the path of least resistance, put his own interests above those of other people. He\u2019d believed that was the basis of prosperity, of success. Deserting Catherine was where it had started. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d been the first of his regrets. Matthias was the second. And then his mother...</p><p>Matthias Jamison was his father\u2019s cousin and an employee at the winery. Greg\u2019s parents had divorced when he was in high school, and he and Phil had spent summers with their father at the vineyard. Although the younger of the two, Greg was the one who\u2019d been drawn to the family business. He\u2019d spent hour after hour there, learning everything he could about wine and wine making.</p><p>Ten years his senior, Matthias had taken Greg under his wing. What John Bennett didn\u2019t teach Greg about wine making, Matthias did. His father had also insisted Greg get a business degree, and he\u2019d been right. Several years later, when he died, Greg bought out Phil\u2019s half to become sole owner and worked with Matthias operating the winery.</p><p>The wine had always been good. What the business needed was an aggressive advertising campaign. People couldn\u2019t order the Bennett label if they\u2019d never heard of it. The difficulty with Greg\u2019s ideas was the huge financial investment they demanded. Commissioning sophisticated full-page ads and placing them in upscale food magazines, attending wine expositions throughout the world\u2014it had all cost money. He\u2019d taken a gamble, which was just starting to pay off when Matthias came to him, needing a loan.</p> <p>Mary, Matthias\u2019s wife of many years, had developed a rare form of blood cancer. The experimental drug that might save her life wasn\u2019t covered by their health insurance. The cost of the medication was threatening to bankrupt Matthias; his savings were gone and no bank would lend him money. He\u2019d asked Greg for help. After everything the older man had done for him and for his family, Greg knew he owed Matthias that and more.</p><p>The decision had been agonizing. Bennett Wines was just beginning to gain recognition; sales had doubled and tripled. But Greg\u2019s plans were bigger than that. He\u2019d wanted to help Matthias, but there was no guarantee the treatment would be effective. So he\u2019d turned Matthias down. Mary had died a few months later, when conventional treatments failed, and a bitter Matthias had left Bennett Wines and moved to Washington state.</p><p>Generally Greg didn\u2019t encourage friendships. He tended to believe that friends took advantage of you, that they resented your success. It was every man for himself, in Greg\u2019s view. Still, Matthias had been the best friend he\u2019d ever had. Because of what happened, the two men hadn\u2019t spoken in fifteen years.</p><p>Greg could have used Matthias\u2019s expertise in dealing with the blight that had struck his vines, but he was too proud to give him the opportunity to slam the door in his face. To refuse him the way he\u2019d refused Matthias all those years ago.</p><p>No, Greg definitely wasn\u2019t church material. Whatever had possessed him to think he should go into this place, seek solace here, he couldn\u2019t fathom.</p> <p>He was about to turn away when he noticed that the church doors were wide open. Had they been open all this time? He supposed they must have been. It was almost as if he was being invited inside.... He shook his head, wondering where that ridiculous thought had come from. Nevertheless, he slowly walked in.</p><p>The interior was dim and his eyes took a moment to adjust. He saw that the sanctuary was huge, with two rows of pews facing a wide altar. Even the church was decorated for the holidays. Pots of red and white poinsettias were arranged on the altar, and a row of gaily decorated Christmas trees stood behind it. A large cross hung suspended from the ceiling.</p><p>An organ sat off to one side, along with a sectioned space for the choir. Greg hadn\u2019t stopped to notice which denomination this church was. Nor did he care.</p><p>Although his mother had been an ardent churchgoer, Greg had hated it, found it meaningless. But Phil seemed to eat this religious stuff up, just like their mother had.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Greg said aloud. None of this whispering business for him. \u201cThe door was open. I came inside. You want me to tell you I made a mess of my life? Fine, I screwed up. I could\u2019ve done better. Is that what you were waiting to hear? Is that what you wanted me to say? I said it. Are you happy now?\u201d</p><p>His words reverberated, causing him to retreat a step.</p> <p>And as he did, his life suddenly overwhelmed him. His failures, his shortcomings, his mistakes came roaring at him like an avalanche, jerking him off his feet. He seemed to tumble backward through the years. The force of it was too much and he slumped into a pew, the weight of his past impossible to bear. He leaned forward and buried his face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cCan you forgive me, Mama?\u201d he whispered brokenly. \u201cIs there any way I can make up for what I did\u2014not being there for you? When you needed me...\u201d</p><p>He deserved every rotten thing that was happening to him. If he couldn\u2019t get a loan, if he lost the winery, it would be what he deserved. All of it.</p><p>Greg wouldn\u2019t have recognized his words as a prayer. But, they wove their way upward, past the church altar, past the suspended crucifix, toward the bell tower and church steeple. Once free of the building, they flew heavenward, through the clouds and beyond the sky, landing with a crash on the cluttered desk of the Archangel Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d the archangel said, a little surprised and more than a little pleased. \u201cWhat do we have here?\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>The Archangel Gabriel arched his white brows as he reviewed Greg Bennett\u2019s file. A very thick file. \u201cWell, it\u2019s about time,\u201d he muttered, and dutifully recorded the prayer request.</p><p>\u201cI certainly agree with you there,\u201d a soft female voice murmured in response.</p> <p>Gabriel didn\u2019t have to look up to see who\u2019d joined him. That angelic voice was all too familiar. Shirley was visiting, and where Shirley was, Goodness and Mercy were sure to follow. His three favorite troublemakers\u2014heaven help him. Without having to ask, he knew what she wanted. The trio had been pestering him for three years about a return trip to earth.</p><p>\u201cHello, Shirley,\u201d Gabriel said without much enthusiasm. The truth was, he\u2019d always been partial to Shirley, Goodness and Mercy, although he dared not let it show. Their escapades on earth were notorious in the corridors of paradise and had created an uproar on more than one occasion.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve decided you seem frazzled,\u201d Goodness said, popping up next to her friend. She rested her arms on Gabriel\u2019s desk, studying him avidly.</p><p>\u201cOverworked,\u201d Mercy agreed, appearing beside the other two.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re here to help.\u201d Shirley walked around the front of his desk and gave him a pitying look.</p><p>\u201cWe feel your pain,\u201d Goodness told him.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t sounded so sincere, Gabriel would have laughed outright. He was still tempted to tell her to cut the psychobabble, but knew that wouldn\u2019t do any good. As it was, he sighed and leaned back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014what can we do to help?\u201d Mercy inquired with a serenity few would question.</p><p>\u201cHelp?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou can help me most by participating in the heavenly host again this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already done that for three years,\u201d Goodness complained with a slight pout, crossing her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s just no fun to be one in a cast of thousands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want to go back to earth,\u201d Shirley explained. Of the three, she was the most plain-spoken. Gabriel knew he could count on her to tell him the truth. She did her utmost to keep the other two in line, but could only hold out for so long before she succumbed to temptation herself.</p><p>\u201cI love humans,\u201d Goodness said, hands clasped as she gazed longingly toward earth.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Mercy was quick to add. \u201cWhere else in the universe would anyone assume God is dead and Elvis is alive?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel successfully hid a smile. \u201cEven with the best of intentions, you three have never been able to keep your wings to yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Shirley nodded in agreement. \u201cBut remember we\u2019re angels, not saints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to make you stay in heaven where you belong,\u201d Gabriel argued.</p><p>The objections came fast and furious.</p><p>\u201cBut you need us this year!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than ever, Gabriel. You\u2019ve got far more work than you can handle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overburdened!\u201d</p><p>True enough. As always, Christmas was his busiest time of year, and Gabriel\u2019s desk was flooded with thousands upon thousands of prayer requests. No denying it, human beings were the most difficult of God\u2019s subjects. Obtuse, demanding and contrary. Many of them flung prayer requests at heaven without once considering that humans played a role in solving their own problems. The hard part was getting them to recognize that they had lessons to learn before their prayer requests could be granted. God-directed solutions often came from within themselves. Gabriel\u2019s task, with the help of his other prayer ambassadors, was to show these proud stubborn creatures the way.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any requests from children?\u201d Shirley asked. As a former guardian angel, she enjoyed working with youngsters the most.</p><p>\u201cAnyone in need of a little Mercy?\u201d Mercy prodded.</p><p>\u201cAny good faithful souls who could use a bit of angelic guidance?\u201d Goodness asked.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Gabriel said abruptly as he shoved Greg Bennett\u2019s prayer request at them.</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t know what had possessed him. Frustration, perhaps. Then again, it could have been something far more powerful. It could have been the very hand of God. \u201cThis request will require all three of you. Read it over, do your homework and get back to me. You might decide that singing with the heavenly host doesn\u2019t sound so bad, after all.\u201d</p><p>He grinned sheepishly as they fluttered away, eager to discover everything they could about this sad human and the sorry mess he\u2019d made of his life.</p><p>In truth Gabriel half expected they\u2019d choose to return to the heavenly choir; if they did he wouldn\u2019t blame them. Greg Bennett\u2019s case would be a challenge for the most experienced prayer ambassadors\u2014let alone these three. Once Shirley, Goodness and Mercy had the opportunity to read his file, they were bound to see that.</p><p>The trio gathered around the file detailing the life of Greg Bennett. Shirley noted that their excited chatter had quickly died down as they read. The oldest and most mature, she could see through Gabriel\u2019s ploy. The archangel expected them to give up before they started. To tell him how right he was and scurry back to choir practice. In light of what she\u2019d learned about Greg Bennett, perhaps that would be for the best.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Goodness whispered. \u201cHe abandoned his college sweetheart when she was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeserted his best friend in his hour of need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook what he did to his own mother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo his mother?\u201d</p><p>Shirley nodded. \u201cGreg Bennett is a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScumbag,\u201d Mercy supplied.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s arrogant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd conceited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a whole bunch of miracles to whip this poor boy into shape.\u201d</p><p>Shirley had no argument there. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Greg Bennett is more than any of us could handle,\u201d she said sadly.</p><p>Goodness and Mercy glanced at each other. \u201cShe\u2019s joking, isn\u2019t she?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Shirley said on a disparaging note. \u201cYou read for yourself what kind of man he is. Frankly, I feel someone else, someone who\u2019s got more experience with humans and their frailties, would be better equipped to deal with the likes of Mr. Bennett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fiddlesticks!\u201d Goodness cried.</p><p>\u201cWe can do it,\u201d Mercy contended with considerably more confidence than the success of her earlier exploits might have warranted.</p><p>\u201cWe all know Gabriel did this on purpose,\u201d Goodness said. Apparently she hadn\u2019t been fooled, either. \u201cHe assumed that once we see what a mess Greg\u2019s made of his life, we\u2019ll figure it\u2019s hopeless and slink back to the choir. Well, I, for one, have no intention of spending another Christmas singing my lungs out over the fields of Bethlehem. To be so close to earth and yet so far...\u201d</p> <p>Mercy giggled but appeared to be in full agreement. \u201cCome on, Shirley, this is our one and only chance to return to earth. Okay, so you\u2019re right. Greg Bennett isn\u2019t exactly a believer in God\u2019s love, but God does love him. Heaven knows he needs help.\u201d</p><p>Shirley was adamant. \u201cMore than we can give him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be such a pessimist,\u201d Goodness chided. \u201cIf nothing else, we can steer him in the right direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSan Francisco,\u201d Mercy said, tapping her cheek. \u201cThere are ships in San Francisco, aren\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>Shirley could already see trouble brewing. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to promise to stay away from the shipyard,\u201d she said heatedly. It\u2019d taken them years to live down what had happened at the Bremerton Naval Shipyard in Washington state. The news crew that covered the repositioning of two aircraft carriers might as well have been reporting directly to heaven, what with all the attention the incident had received.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I promise, no shipyard,\u201d Mercy said. Shirley was appeased until she thought she saw her fellow angel wink at Goodness. Oh, my, if they took the Bennett case, then this was going to be some Christmas. On the other hand...</p><p>\u201cWhere are you headed?\u201d Goodness called out when Shirley broke away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to tell Gabriel we\u2019ll take the job. Just don\u2019t make me sorry I agreed to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould we do that?\u201d Mercy asked, the picture of angelic innocence.</p><p>Shirley had a very good reason for feeling skeptical, but an even better reason for tackling this stint on earth. She wanted out of the choir as much as her two friends did. A human, even one who happened to have more than his share of frailties, wasn\u2019t going to stop her.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad!\u201d Michael Thorpe bounded enthusiastically into the hospital clinic, his eyes sparkling.</p> <p>Dr. Edward Thorpe looked up from the chart he was reading and smiled at the sight of his son. His wife, Janice, five months pregnant, hurried to keep up with the energetic boy.</p><p>The six-year-old raced into his arms and Edward lifted him high above his head. Seeing his own healthy happy son was exactly what he needed. Much of his morning had been spent with another youngster, Tanner Westley, who was ten and suffering from a rare form of leukemia. Edward was an oncologist who specialized in childhood cancers; his work had recently garnered the interest of the San Francisco Herald. Just today, a reporter had interviewed him for a piece the paper was running on the urgent need for bone-marrow donors. The story would include a photograph of Tanner. Most members of the public didn\u2019t seem to understand that they had the opportunity to save lives by testing to become donors. The only thing required at this stage was a simple blood test. The article would make a strongly worded plea for bone-marrow donors to help children such as Tanner.</p><p>The reporter felt the timing was good. People seemed more generous with their time and money over the Christmas period. Edward hoped they\u2019d be equally giving about submitting to a blood test.</p><p>\u201cHello, darling,\u201d his wife said.</p><p>\u201cIs it lunchtime already?\u201d With the interview and Tanner Westley\u2019s additional tests, his morning had flown.</p><p>Janice glanced at her watch. \u201cActually, we\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom and I were shopping.\u201d Michael rolled his eyes as if to say how much that had bored him. Edward hid a smile. An intolerance for shopping was something he had in common with his son.</p><p>\u201cCan you still join us for lunch?\u201d Janice asked.</p> <p>Now it was Edward\u2019s turn to glance at his watch. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind eating in the cafeteria.\u201d He needed to be within a few minutes of Tanner, who was starting a new chemotherapy session today.</p><p>\u201cWe can eat in the cafeteria, can\u2019t we, Mom?\u201d Michael tugged at his mother\u2019s arm. \u201cTheir ice-cream machine is way cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2014I\u2019m convinced,\u201d Janice responded good-naturedly as the three of them headed toward the elevator.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here?\u201d Goodness demanded, her voice unnaturally high. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t like hospitals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring us here. Shirley did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you two stop it?\u201d Shirley sighed in exasperation. Goodness and Mercy were enough to try the patience of a saint, let alone another angel. \u201cThat\u2019s Greg Bennett\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cancer specialist,\u201d Shirley said, thinking it should have been obvious.</p><p>\u201cYou mean he\u2019s Catherine\u2019s child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d It was Gabriel who\u2019d directed her to the hospital, but she hadn\u2019t told the others that. As far as she was concerned, they would receive information strictly on a need-to-know basis. It was safer that way.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike his birth father,\u201d Goodness said under her breath.</p><p>Shirley agreed completely. \u201cGreg Bennett broke Catherine\u2019s heart, you know.\u201d The file had told her that, and ever since, she\u2019d found it a struggle to care in the slightest about Greg and his vineyard.</p><p>\u201cShe loved him deeply,\u201d Mercy added, shaking her head. \u201cWhen Greg turned his back on her, she was devastated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she gave birth to Edward and raised him on her own, and had trouble trusting men again for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t marry until Edward was nearly eight.\u201d Shirley recounted the facts as she remembered them. \u201cBut she\u2019s very happy now....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she have other children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA daughter, who\u2019s a child psychologist,\u201d Shirley supplied. \u201cThey meet every Friday for lunch on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s on the waterfront, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Mercy brightened.</p><p>Shirley cast her fellow angel a quelling look. She didn\u2019t want to say it, but Mercy\u2019s obsession with ships was beginning to bother her. Oh, my, she didn\u2019t know how she was going to get through this holiday season with Goodness and Mercy and still have any kind of effect on Greg Bennett. As much fun as it was to enjoy the things of this earth, they were on an important mission and didn\u2019t have time to get sidetracked.</p><p>\u201cMeanwhile, Greg has had three wives and each one of them looks exactly like Catherine,\u201d Goodness pointed out.</p><p>Shirley hadn\u2019t recognized that, but as soon as Goodness made the observation, she knew it was true. \u201cOnly he doesn\u2019t see there\u2019s a pattern here,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t opened his eyes wide enough to see it,\u201d Goodness said.</p><p>\u201cYet.\u201d Mercy crossed her arms in a determined way that seemed to suggest she\u2019d take great delight in telling him.</p><p>\u201cYet?\u201d Shirley raised her eyebrows in warning, but continued her summary of Greg\u2019s failings. \u201cHis only child, a son he deserted before he was born, grew up to become a noted cancer specialist, while Greg has squandered his life on wine and women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and while he was trying to pick up some blond babe in a fancy bar, Edward was treating a ten-year-old leukemia patient,\u201d Mercy said in a scornful voice.</p><p>Goodness grew quiet, which was always a dangerous sign.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Shirley asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about Catherine,\u201d Goodness confessed.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t seen her since college,\u201d Shirley put in.</p><p>\u201cBut it seems to me that Greg\u2019s been searching for her in every woman he\u2019s met,\u201d Goodness said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cCertainly every woman he marries,\u201d Mercy added, not concealing her disgust.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Shirley prodded. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point, Goodness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...perhaps we should do something to help make it happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if he\u2019s looking for Catherine, which he seems to be doing, we can make sure he finds her. He should see what she\u2019s done with her life, how happy she is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a good idea,\u201d Shirley protested. \u201cYou know the rules as well as I do, and we\u2019re not supposed to interfere in human lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about interfering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any rule against sending humans in a particular direction, is there?\u201d Mercy asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but...\u201d Shirley began. Goodness and Mercy, however, had disappeared before the words left her lips.</p><p>Oh, dear. Already it was starting. Already she\u2019d lost control.</p><p>Shirley raced after the other two, hoping she could stop them in time.</p><p>Three</p><p>Greg had remained in the church longer than he\u2019d intended. He felt a little foolish sitting there in that quiet darkened place all alone. It was almost as if...as if he was waiting for something to happen. Or for someone to appear and speak to him\u2014which, of course, was ridiculous. God was hardly going to drop down and have a heart-to-heart with someone like him.</p><p>Other than that unaccountable feeling of anticipation, nothing out of the ordinary had occurred during the time he\u2019d been in this church. Nevertheless, the experience had calmed him. For that half hour, Greg was able to set his troubles aside. He\u2019d never been one to dwell on the negatives; it was far easier to push his regrets and worries from his mind, pretend they didn\u2019t exist. Anyway, he\u2019d always managed to surmount his business problems, even when the vineyard had suffered from other disasters\u2014flooding or frost or even fire.</p><p>Only this time he had a gut feeling that there wasn\u2019t going to be any last-minute rescue. This one was different. If some kind of solution didn\u2019t turn up soon, he was going to lose everything.</p><p>At sixty he was too old to start over.</p><p>After he left the church, he began walking again, his thoughts heavy. It probably wasn\u2019t a good idea to drive yet, so he aimlessly wandered the streets. He considered the few options he had. He could declare bankruptcy. Or he could throw himself on his brother\u2019s mercy. Phil had become a vice president of Pacific Union, one of the largest banks in the state. He could certainly pull strings to help Greg secure a loan.</p><p>But they hadn\u2019t spoken since their mother\u2019s death. Greg didn\u2019t blame Phil for hating him, especially after what he\u2019d done. Another regret. Another person who\u2019d needed him\u2014another person he\u2019d failed. His own mother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A sick feeling settled over him. He increased his pace as if he could outdistance his guilt. His mother might have forgiven him, but his brother hadn\u2019t. Their quarrel following the funeral had ended any chance Greg might have had of receiving Phil\u2019s help now.</p><p>Although he wasn\u2019t hungry, Greg decided to find some lunch. With food in his stomach to cut the effects of the alcohol, he could safely drive, and empty though it was, home had begun to seem mighty appealing.</p><p>He could buy a cup of chowder or a seafood sandwich along Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, so he hurried downhill toward the waterfront, his pace filled with sudden purpose. The wind was cold and brisk, and he gathered his coat around him as he neared the wharf. What on earth were all these people doing here? No doubt spending their money on useless junk for Christmas. Grumbling, he wove his way through the crowds toward the closest fish bar.</p><p>\u201cThere she is,\u201d Goodness whispered, pressing her face against the restaurant window.</p> <p>\u201cYou found her?\u201d Mercy sounded incredulous as she peered in the window, too. \u201cOh, my, Catherine really is lovely.\u201d</p><p>Shirley couldn\u2019t resist. She cupped her hands about her face and gazed through the smudged glass, too.</p><p>\u201cHer daughter looks exactly like her,\u201d Mercy said.</p><p>Her friends were right, Shirley thought. Catherine was a classic beauty who carried herself with grace and elegance. Her daughter, whose name was Carrie, if she remembered correctly, strongly resembled her mother. It was like turning back the clock and seeing Catherine as the young college student who had loved and trusted Greg Bennett.</p><p>Shirley pinched her lips, disliking Greg Bennett more than ever. She wasn\u2019t one to suffer fools gladly.</p> <p>\u201cGreg Bennett needs a lot of help,\u201d she said, disheartened that their angelic talents were being wasted on a man who would neither acknowledge nor appreciate their endeavors.</p><p>Shirley figured that if the three of them stood directly in front of him in a full display of God\u2019s glory, Greg would turn around and head in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cI bet Catherine didn\u2019t think so at the time, but the fact that Greg Bennett walked out on her was probably the best thing that could\u2019ve happened. He\u2019s been a rotten husband to all three of his wives.\u201d Goodness shook her head in disgust. Apparently, she, too, was having difficulty finding him worthy of their assistance.</p><p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Mercy said, her expression thoughtful, \u201cis why Gabriel would assign us someone who\u2019s so...\u201d She floundered.</p><p>Goodness finished the sentence for her. \u201cImpossible,\u201d she said. \u201cGreg Bennett\u2019s impossible. And he doesn\u2019t care about God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut as we\u2019ve discussed before, God cares about him, and so does Gabriel. Greg Bennett is the reason we\u2019re here,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cThe reason we had an opportunity to return to earth. It\u2019s our duty to make sure this is a Christmas he\u2019ll remember.\u201d</p> <p>Both Goodness and Mercy stepped aside as Catherine and her daughter walked out of the restaurant, laughing and talking animatedly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Goodness agreed once mother and daughter had passed. \u201cI don\u2019t like Greg Bennett any more than either of you, but God loves him.\u201d She began to say something else, then stopped abruptly. Her deep blue eyes grew huge. \u201cOh\u2014look at that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt what?\u201d Shirley demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never guess who\u2019s here,\u201d Goodness said excitedly. \u201cRight now!\u201d</p><p>Shirley whirled about, almost afraid to look. It couldn\u2019t be\u2014but she knew it had to be. \u201cGreg Bennett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something,\u201d Mercy insisted. \u201cThink, everyone. We can\u2019t let an opportunity like this pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...no!\u201d Shirley cried, but Goodness and Mercy were already moving toward a table covered with steaming cooked crabs. \u201cNot the crabs,\u201d but it was too late.</p><p>These Friday luncheon dates with her daughter were a delightful part of Catherine Thorpe\u2019s week. The hour with Carrie always went by in a flash. Meeting her daughter gave her an excuse to linger in the downtown area, as well. San Francisco in December was a sight to behold, and she planned to finish up her afternoon with some holiday shopping. She loved spoiling her grandson, and with another grandchild due in April, her world was full.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you and Dad on Sunday, then,\u201d Carrie said as they strolled toward her office building.</p><p>\u201cBring Jason with you,\u201d Catherine urged. She knew her daughter well enough to recognize that her current boyfriend was someone special.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Carrie chided, \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She was interrupted by a terrible clang. For no apparent reason, a table full of freshly cooked crabs toppled over, scattering them in every direction. Most of the contents slid across the pavement toward a strikingly attractive older man who leaped out of the way with enviable dexterity.</p><p>Catherine recognized Greg instantly, but she soon discovered that his gaze was focused on Carrie. He frowned, as if confused.</p><p>\u201cCatherine?\u201d</p><p>Carrie turned toward her mother and Greg\u2019s gaze followed. Catherine looked him full in the face, was looking at him for the first time in thirty-five years. Her lungs felt frozen and for a moment she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>So this was Greg.</p><p>During the past decades Catherine had sometimes wondered how she\u2019d react if she ever saw him again. Now she knew. Her mouth went dry, and the remembered pain of what he\u2019d done made it difficult to swallow.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s voice sounded as if it was coming from a great distance.</p><p>Catherine had to make a concerted effort to pull her attention back to her daughter.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost,\u201d Carrie said worriedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Catherine assured her daughter, but in fact, she was seeing a ghost. The ghost of a man who had destroyed her ability to love and trust. Time had dulled her bitterness toward Greg Bennett, had changed her feelings, but even all these years couldn\u2019t minimize the shock of seeing him so unexpectedly.</p><p>Before she could decide if she should approach Greg or ignore him, he took a step toward her, then hesitated. Catherine remained still. He slowly came closer until they stood face-to-face.</p><p>A flurry of activity went on about them as several people scurried to pick up the spilled crabs, but Catherine barely noticed.</p><p>\u201cCatherine.\u201d Greg\u2019s voice was low, a little shaky.</p><p>\u201cYou know my mother?\u201d Carrie asked, taking Catherine\u2019s arm protectively.</p><p>\u201cGreg\u2019s an old friend,\u201d Catherine explained when it became apparent that Greg wasn\u2019t answering. She saw the way he stared at her daughter, and then she understood why. \u201cGreg, this is my twenty-five-year-old daughter, Carrie Thorpe.\u201d</p><p>He picked up her message quickly. This wasn\u2019t his child, his daughter, and to his credit his recovery was smooth. \u201cYou\u2019re just as beautiful as your mother. When I first saw you I thought you were your mother.\u201d</p><p>Carrie blushed at the praise. \u201cPeople tell me that all the time.\u201d She suddenly glanced at her watch. \u201cOh, no. I hope you\u2019ll forgive me, but I have to rush back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Greg said as Carrie turned away.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, darling,\u201d Catherine called after her. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you and Jason Sunday for dinner.\u201d</p><p>When she was gone, Catherine looked at Greg. She\u2019d always known this might happen, that she\u2019d encounter Greg again, but now that she had, she wasn\u2019t sure what to do or what to say.</p><p>Greg seemed equally flustered. \u201cIt\u2019s been...a lot of years.\u201d</p><p>She gave a quick nod.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to sit down?\u201d he asked, then offered her a shaky smile. \u201cFrankly, my knees feel like they\u2019re about to give out on me.\u201d</p><p>Catherine didn\u2019t feel much steadier herself. \u201cThat sounds like a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Greg led her to a sidewalk caf\u00e9, and when the waiter appeared, he ordered coffee for both of them. Although she normally drank her coffee black, Catherine added sugar to help her recover from the shock.</p><p>\u201cDoes Carrie have any older siblings?\u201d Greg asked after a moment of stilted silence.</p><p>\u201cA brother...I...had a boy seven months after you left,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou kept the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou raised him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>She merely nodded this time, her throat thickening with the memory of the hardships she\u2019d endured in those early years\u2014the long hours, the hard work, the sleepless nights. \u201cI...married when Edward was eight,\u201d she managed after a while, \u201cand a year later Larry adopted him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have a son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Catherine told him, but without malice. \u201cYou are the biological father of a child. A wonderful young man who matured without the opportunity of ever knowing you. Without your ever knowing him.\u201d</p><p>Greg stared down at his coffee. \u201cI was young. Stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid,\u201d Catherine added softly. \u201cWe both were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t the one who ran away.\u201d</p><p>Catherine\u2019s laugh was wry. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. I was the one carrying the baby.\u201d</p><p>Greg briefly closed his eyes. \u201cI regret what I did, Catherine. I wanted to know what happened, but was afraid to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her then, as if he found it difficult to believe what she was saying.</p><p>Catherine glanced away. \u201cIt happened a very long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He choked out the words, his voice raw with emotion.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His face revealed his doubt, his confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize, Greg. I forgave you years ago. You didn\u2019t realize it at the time and neither did I, but you gave me a beautiful gift in Edward. He was a wonderful child and a joy to my parents, who helped me raise him those first few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou moved back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil the baby was born. Then Mom watched him for me during the day while I finished college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have been difficult for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d Catherine wasn\u2019t going to minimize the sacrifices demanded of her as a single mother. Those years had been bleak.</p><p>\u201cEdward,\u201d Greg said. \u201cAfter your father.\u201d</p><p>Catherine nodded, surprised he\u2019d remembered her father\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cHow could you forgive me?\u201d Greg asked, sounding almost angry that she didn\u2019t harbor some deep resentment toward him. It was as if he expected her to punish him, to mete out her own form of justice right then and there.</p><p>\u201cI had to forgive you, Greg, before I could get on with my life. After a while, the bitterness was more than I could endure. I had to leave it behind, and once I did, I discovered a true freedom. Soon afterward, I met Larry. We\u2019ve been married for twenty-seven years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t deserve your forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not for me to say. But don\u2019t think forgiving you was easy, because it wasn\u2019t. When I first heard you\u2019d left, I refused to accept it. I read your letter over and over\u2014even though I couldn\u2019t take it in. I was convinced you\u2019d be back. All you needed was time to sort everything out. I told myself you\u2019d return to me and everything would be all right...but I had a rude awakening.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI...wasn\u2019t ready to be a father.

The physical resemblance is there, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Greg looked up and smiled faintly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s six-two and muscular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old? Thirty-four?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThirty-five,\u201d she told him. \u201cHis birthday was last month on the twenty-ninth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and he has a son himself and another baby on the way. Next spring.\u201d</p><p>Greg\u2019s smile grew wider.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Greg seemed to have trouble believing it.</p> <p>\u201cMy husband is, too.\u201d Perhaps it was time to remind Greg who Edward\u2019s father was. \u201cLarry raised Edward, helped make him the kind of man he is. Larry\u2019s his father.\u201d</p><p>Greg shook his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t interfere in his life.\u201d</p><p>It took a moment for his words to sink in\u2014and then it occurred to her what he\u2019d meant. \u201cAre you asking to meet Edward?\u201d</p><p>Greg didn\u2019t respond for a long time. His face pale and intent, he finally said, \u201cYes. Could I?\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>Matthias Jamison enjoyed puttering around in his greenhouse before breakfast. The mornings\u2014that was when he missed Mary the most. She\u2019d been gone fifteen years now, and not a day passed that he didn\u2019t think about the woman he\u2019d loved for more than thirty years. Some men he\u2019d known were quick to remarry after losing their wives. Not him. Mary had been the only woman for him, and no one else would ever fill the void left by her death.</p><p>The sunrise over the Cascade Mountains was glorious, the light creeping up over the horizon, then spilling across his western-Washington vineyard like the promise it was. The morning sun was a reassurance, the pledge of another day, another opportunity. Mary had been the one to teach him that, but he\u2019d never fully appreciated her enthusiasm for mornings until it was too late. He wished he\u2019d shared more sunrises with his beloved wife.</p><p>Their only grandson now suffered from the same rare form of leukemia that had claimed her prematurely. It looked as if Tanner, too, would die. Matthias\u2019s jaw tensed and he closed his eyes. How could a loving God let an innocent child suffer like this?</p> <p>What made an untenable situation even worse was the fact that his daughter bore the burden alone. Her ex had done nothing for her or the boy, making Matthias feel doubly responsible, but beyond phone calls and the occasional visit, there was little he could do to help her from where he lived.</p><p>The phone rang and Matthias hurried back to the house, hoping for good news. \u201cHello,\u201d he answered in his usual gruff voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Harry.\u201d</p><p>A longtime friend and vineyard owner from the Napa Valley. \u201cA little early for you to be phoning, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Matthias couldn\u2019t prevent his disappointment from showing. He\u2019d been hoping it was his daughter, Gloria, on the phone. He sighed heavily. It damn near killed Matthias that he was as powerless to help the boy as he\u2019d been with Mary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got news that\u2019ll cheer you right up,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cI could use some good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Greg Bennett.\u201d</p><p>Matthias stiffened at the sound of the name. He hated Greg Bennett with an intensity that had grown through the years. Bennett owed him. The success of the winery was largely due to Matthias\u2019s guiding hand. If it hadn\u2019t been for him, especially in those early years, Greg would have lost the vineyard ten times over.</p><p>The younger of the two Bennett boys had shown a talent for the business, but Matthias had been the one to teach him about grapes, about wine making, about operating an estate winery. Greg\u2019s father, John Bennett, had lived for the vineyard, to the point that it had destroyed his marriage. But he\u2019d been impatient with the boy, an ineffective teacher.</p><p>A few years after Greg had joined Bennett Wines, John had died, and Greg had taken over. From that point on, Matthias had advised Greg, guided him and helped him expand enough to buy out his brother\u2019s share. Matthias had treated Greg as he would have treated his own son, if he\u2019d had one. He\u2019d shared everything with Greg Bennett, his skills and ideas, his enthusiasm for viticulture and wine making, his friendship. That was what made the betrayal so painful, so devastating. Mary\u2019s illness was an almost intolerable blow, but Greg\u2019s refusal to help them\u2014that had been, in a way, an even greater blow.</p><p>Mary had loved Greg, too. Many nights she\u2019d insisted Greg join them for dinner. She\u2019d opened her home and her heart to Greg, and when she needed him, he\u2019d said no. Neither bonds of family nor friendship, neither obligation nor gratitude, had influenced his decision.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Greg?\u201d Matthias asked now.</p><p>\u201cHe was in San Francisco looking for a loan.\u201d</p><p>So Greg\u2019s vineyard had been hit by fan leaf disease. Matthias had suspected as much, but hadn\u2019t heard. \u201cDid he get one?\u201d</p><p>Harry paused for effect. \u201cNot a dime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d like hearing that.\u201d</p><p>Matthias did, but not nearly as much as he\u2019d hoped. All his energy was focused on doing what he could to help his daughter and grandson. For fifteen years his hatred of Greg Bennett had simmered, until it\u2019d burned a hole straight through his heart. He couldn\u2019t forgive or forget, but his hatred no longer dominated every waking moment.</p><p>\u201cYou always said time wounds all heels.\u201d</p><p>Matthias grinned. Actually, Mary had been the one to say that.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to lose everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what he deserves,\u201d Matthias said without emotion. The younger man had laid the foundation of his own troubles. If anything, Matthias was grateful he\u2019d lived long enough to witness Bennett\u2019s downfall.</p><p>\u201cI bet you think he should rot in hell,\u201d Harry said, and when Matthias didn\u2019t comment, his friend spoke again. \u201cHey, I hate the guy, too. Everyone does\u2014although not as much as you do.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cWell, I better get back to my morning coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to you later,\u201d Harry said. A moment later, the line was disconnected.</p><p>Matthias appreciated knowing of Greg\u2019s financial problems. Fan leaf, a virus, had indiscriminately infected a number of vineyards in both the Sonoma and Napa valleys. Owners had been forced to tear out formerly productive vines and start anew, a prospect that was both time-consuming and expensive. Many of the small and medium-sized wineries in the two valleys were in danger of going under, Greg\u2019s included.</p><p>Mostly retired, Matthias needed something to occupy his time. In recent years he\u2019d been working with local vineyard owners who were trying to grow vines resistant to the fan leaf virus before it had the same devastating results in Washington as in California.</p><p>Standing next to the phone, Matthias realized he should be dancing at the news about the disaster at Bennett Wines. A year ago, even six months ago, he would have been thrilled at the thought of Greg\u2019s troubles. Revenge was said to be a dish best eaten cold, and he\u2019d certainly waited long enough to have it served to him. But he experienced damn little of the pleasure he\u2019d anticipated. He\u2019d wanted Greg to suffer the same agony that had tormented him as he stood by his wife\u2019s bedside.</p><p>The vineyard was everything to Greg, just as Matthias\u2019s only grandchild had become everything to him. And this time, they were both going to lose what they loved most.</p><p>\u201cThat is so sad,\u201d Mercy said, sitting on the edge of the counter in Matthias\u2019s kitchen. \u201cJust look at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s worried sick about his grandson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to the boy?\u201d Both Goodness and Mercy turned to Shirley.</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I have a crystal ball?\u201d Shirley asked irritably.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you two.\u201d Goodness reclined on the long counter. \u201cBut I was hoping for something a little less stressful during this visit to earth. We\u2019re assigned to a guy who\u2019s a real jerk. Someone who couldn\u2019t care less about anyone except himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we\u2019re here on earth, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with you,\u201d Shirley said, cutting in while the opportunity presented itself, \u201cbut we can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun? We got a human with his head so far up his\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMercy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA self-centered human,\u201d she revised. \u201cYou know, I think I\u2019d feel better if Catherine had torn him to shreds. She should never have forgiven him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMercy! Just listen to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right,\u201d she muttered, but Shirley could see that Greg was taking a toll on her friend\u2019s compassion.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got too many problems for us to deal with,\u201d Goodness complained.</p><p>Shirley wasn\u2019t accustomed to such a defeatist attitude. \u201cThere\u2019s always his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about a brother?\u201d Goodness asked, suddenly attentive.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201d Shirley did a double take. At their blank stares she sighed and reminded them. \u201cPhil. You remember reading about Philip Bennett, don\u2019t you? He\u2019s a big muck-a-muck with Pacific Union Bank. Greg considered going to him for a loan, but couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Shirley sighed again. It would help considerably if Goodness and Mercy had finished their research.</p><p>\u201cRefresh my memory, would you?\u201d Goodness asked.</p><p>Shirley felt the burden of responsibility. \u201cYou didn\u2019t read the whole file, did you?\u201d she asked wearily.</p><p>\u201cAh...no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d It would do no good to lecture them now. \u201cGreg\u2019s mother was dying while he was in the middle of his second divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember reading about Bobbi,\u201d Mercy said triumphantly. \u201cHis second trophy wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis second attempt to find another Catherine, you mean,\u201d Goodness muttered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. What does Bobbi and their divorce have to do with Greg\u2019s mother?\u201d Mercy asked. Both angels were lying on their stomachs now, chins propped on their hands.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t finish reading the file, either?\u201d Shirley was dismayed.</p><p>Anything that was going to get accomplished on this mission would obviously be up to her.</p><p>\u201cIt was too depressing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the patience to cope with men like him,\u201d Goodness said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo on about his mother,\u201d Mercy urged, motioning with her hand for Shirley to continue.</p><p>\u201cGreg hid as much of his wealth as he could from Bobbi, mostly in stocks and bonds. Otherwise she\u2019d want her share in a divorce settlement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they married long enough for her to get much?\u201d</p><p>Like most angelic beings, neither Goodness nor Mercy fully understood the way such matters were handled on earth. \u201cDidn\u2019t matter,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cShe had a good attorney.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Apparently Goodness and Mercy were knowledgeable enough to know what that meant.</p><p>\u201cLydia Bennett was dying and asked to see Greg,\u201d Shirley continued. \u201cUnfortunately her request came the morning of his settlement hearing. Greg chose to go to court. I\u2019m sure that if he\u2019d known his mother would die before he got to the hospital, he would\u2019ve canceled the court date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Goodness whispered.</p><p>\u201cPhil never forgave him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. They haven\u2019t spoken in ten years.\u201d</p> <p>Goodness sat up and looked around. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can take much more of this. You two do what you want, but I need a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Shirley demanded. If her fellow angel got into any mischief, she\u2019d be the one held accountable. As usual.</p><p>\u201cOutside,\u201d Goodness called over her shoulder.</p><p>Without a word, Mercy followed Goodness.</p><p>\u201cMercy!\u201d Shirley shouted.</p><p>Flustered now, she raced after the pair and came to an abrupt halt when she saw the hot-air balloons. Their huge parachutes with the bright rainbow-colored panels brightened the sky. There must have been a dozen balloons in the lower Kent Valley. She knew that conditions in the early-morning hours were often ideal for ballooning.</p> <p>\u201cGoodness! Mercy! Don\u2019t even think\u2014\u201d She was too late. Shirley caught sight of them as they hopped into a wicker carriage already filled to capacity. The ground crew was about to release the giant balloon from its tether line.</p><p>\u201cGoodness!\u201d Shirley called, exasperated beyond measure. \u201cMercy! Get out of there!\u201d</p><p>Both pretended not to hear her. Shirley had to be careful. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for humans, especially young ones between the ages of one and five, to hear angels speak. Some older people possessed the ability, too. Inside the basket was an eighty-year-old grandmother who was taking the flight as a birthday gift from her grandchildren.</p><p>\u201cFor the love of heaven, will you two kindly\u2014\u201d Shirley froze, certain she was seeing things. The hot-air balloon had risen only about six feet off the ground, where it remained, hovering, even though the ropes that had bound the craft to earth had been set free.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d the old woman called to the ground crew, who\u2019d stepped aside, obviously waiting for the balloon to glide upward. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be going up?\u201d</p><p>Shirley groaned when she saw the problem. Just as she\u2019d ordered, Goodness and Mercy had indeed left the wicker basket, but had taken positions outside it, securing the dangling tether lines to the ground.</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d Shirley yelled.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s what you really want us to do?\u201d Goodness asked.</p> <p>Without waiting for a response, both Goodness and Mercy released their tether lines at the same time. The balloon shot into the sky like a rocket. A few seconds later, its speed became more sedate.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Shirley heard the grandmother shout, holding on to her protective helmet with one hand and gripping the basket with the other. \u201cCan we do that again?\u201d</p><p>Goodness stood next to Shirley, looking extremely pleased with herself.</p><p>\u201cThat felt wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve risked the entire mission,\u201d Shirley said coldly. \u201cGabriel is sure to hear about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at this,\u201d Mercy called as she joined them. She held a bottle of sparkling wine in one hand and dangled a trio of champagne flutes in the other.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get that?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>\u201cThey fell from the sky.\u201d She grinned broadly as she said it.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Shirl,\u201d Goodness cajoled, \u201chumans aren\u2019t the only ones who enjoy a glass of bubbly now and then.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>Greg had barely slept or eaten in five days. He hadn\u2019t recognized the gaunt beleaguered man who\u2019d stared back at him in the bathroom mirror that morning. For a long time he\u2019d studied his reflection, shocked into numbness. Anyone seeing him would assume his condition was due to either the stress of his vineyard being wiped out or the failure of his third marriage. Neither was true.</p><p>He had a son. Catherine had given birth to a boy, raised that child, loved him, guided him into adulthood. Now this child, the son Greg had rejected, was a doctor. His son was a father himself, which made Greg a grandfather. A grandfather! That knowledge was heady stuff for a man who\u2019d never...never been a real father and never would be. When he\u2019d abandoned Catherine and the child, Greg had assumed there\u2019d be plenty of time for a wife and family. He hadn\u2019t realized back then that this child of Catherine\u2019s was his only chance. In his cowardice he\u2019d thrown away the very life he\u2019d always expected to have.</p><p>The first emotion he\u2019d felt when Catherine told him about Edward had been undiluted joy. He had no right to feel anything\u2014he knew that without her having to say it\u2014but it\u2019d been impossible to hide his reaction. Catherine always did possess the uncanny ability to see through him. It was one reason he hadn\u2019t been able to face her after she\u2019d told him about the pregnancy. Evading responsibility, he\u2019d run and hadn\u2019t looked back\u2014but he\u2019d been looking back plenty these past five days. Every waking minute, to be precise.</p><p>Greg wouldn\u2019t have blamed Catherine if she\u2019d ranted at him, called him every ugly name her vocabulary would allow. But she hadn\u2019t. Instead, she\u2019d offered him a gracious forgiveness, of which he felt completely undeserving.</p><p>He could have accepted her anger far more easily than her generosity of spirit. As unbelievable as it seemed, she was the one who\u2019d made excuses for the shabby way he\u2019d treated her.</p><p>All Greg could do was torment himself by thinking of the opportunities he\u2019d missed when he walked out on Catherine. Since their meeting Friday afternoon, the sick feeling in the pit of his stomach had refused to go away. He didn\u2019t know what to do next, but one thing was clear: he had to do something.</p><p>Catherine had said she\u2019d get in touch with him about his meeting Edward. He could tell she wasn\u2019t keen on the idea; her pointed remark that Edward already had a father had hit its mark. She\u2019d said the decision would come after she\u2019d had a chance to talk it over with her husband, Larry, and with Edward himself. They\u2019d parted then, with Catherine promising to call soon.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t heard from her since, and the waiting was killing him.</p><p>By five that evening Greg had lost patience and decided to call Catherine. He hurried into his office and reached for the telephone, intent on dialing directory assistance. As he lifted the receiver, a week\u2019s worth of mail slipped off his desk and onto the carpet.</p><p>With money pressures the way they were, Greg had been ignoring the mail, which consisted mainly of past-due notices and dunning letters from his attorneys. He stooped to pick up the envelopes, and that was when he saw it.</p><p>A letter addressed to him in Catherine\u2019s flowing penmanship. Thirty-five years, and he still recognized her beautiful handwriting.</p><p>Without conscious thought, he replaced the receiver. He studied the envelope carefully, noting the postmark. She\u2019d mailed it the day after their meeting. He held it for a couple of minutes before he had the courage to open it.</p><p>The letter was brief.</p><p>Saturday, December 4</p><p>Dear Greg,</p><p>I\u2019m sure you were as shocked to see me yesterday as I was to see you. As I said, I always thought we\u2019d meet again one day, but I was still unprepared for actually running into you.</p><p>I should have anticipated that you\u2019d want to meet the son you fathered. It was shortsighted of me not to consider that before. I discussed it with Larry. My husband is both wise and generous, and he felt neither of us should be involved in making such an important decision. He thought I should leave it entirely up to Edward.</p><p>I was able to reach Edward yesterday evening. It wasn\u2019t an easy conversation. He had a number of questions\u2014ones I\u2019d been able to avoid until now. I answered him truthfully; perhaps because I did, he\u2019s decided against meeting you.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, Greg. I know this disappoints you.</p><p>Catherine</p><p>Greg read the letter a second time, then slumped in his chair, eyes closed, while sharp pangs of disappointment stabbed him. It didn\u2019t escape his notice that Catherine had used the same form of communication he\u2019d used when he deserted her. When he\u2019d seen her the previous week, he\u2019d given her his business card with his personal phone number. She could have put him out of his agony days earlier; instead, she\u2019d chosen to torment him. She\u2019d probably derived a great deal of satisfaction from turning him down, letting him know he wasn\u2019t wanted. No doubt, she\u2019d waited thirty-five years for the privilege.</p><p>In an outburst of anger he crumpled the letter and tossed it in the wastebasket. Still not satisfied, he swept his arm across the desktop, knocking everything onto the carpet. His chest heaving, he buried his face in both hands.</p><p>The Christmas spirit had infected Phil Bennett. He hummed along to \u201cSilent Night,\u201d which played on the bedroom radio, as he changed out of his business suit on Wednesday evening. Some people liked secular Christmas music the best, but Phil preferred the carols.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly seem to be in a good mood this evening,\u201d his wife remarked when he joined her in the kitchen for dinner. Sandy had grown a little thick through the waist over the past decade, but then, so had he. They\u2019d been married for more than thirty years and raised three daughters and now they were both looking forward to retiring. The previous year, Phil and Sandy had purchased property in Arizona and planned to build in a retirement community, together with their best friends. It wouldn\u2019t be long now before the only real commuting he\u2019d do would be on a par-three golf course.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so happy?\u201d Sandy asked as she brought a platter of meat loaf to the small kitchen table. With the children grown and on their own, Phil and Sandy had taken to eating their meals in the kitchen, instead of the dining room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Phil said, carrying over the tossed green salad. When she wasn\u2019t looking, he removed a sliced cucumber and munched on it.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019ve got the spirit of the season,\u201d Sandy said absently as she placed a bowl of steaming scalloped potatoes on a trivet.</p><p>\u201cI do indeed,\u201d Phil murmured, even though it wasn\u2019t Christmas that had made him so cheerful. Actually, Christmas had very little to do with it, but he wasn\u2019t telling his wife that.</p><p>Once Sandy found out that his glee was entirely because of what he\u2019d learned about his brother\u2019s financial woes, she was sure to lecture him. And Phil was in too fine a mood to be chastised. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Word had reached him that afternoon of Greg\u2019s numerous attempts to obtain financing for Bennett Wines. It did his heart good to learn that his ungrateful arrogant younger brother was about to receive the justice he so amply deserved.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to choir practice tonight, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Sandy asked as she pulled out the chair across from him and sat down.</p><p>Caught up in his own thoughts, Phil didn\u2019t hear her right away. \u201cChoir practice?\u201d he repeated as he helped himself to a warm-from-the-oven biscuit.</p><p>\u201cPhil!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed. \u201cGood. We need all the practice we can get.\u201d</p><p>Phil had recently joined the choir. It was his way of being part of the church community and contributing to the service.</p><p>So far, he knew only a few of the other choir members by name, but he\u2019d know them all soon enough, especially now that they were meeting three nights a week to prepare for the Christmas cantata.</p><p>Unlike his brother, Phil was personable and generous\u2014if he did say so himself. Plus, he had a reasonably pleasant singing voice. Greg didn\u2019t. Oh, his younger brother had certain talents, no question. He\u2019d made Bennett Wines a respected label, well-known to wine cognoscenti. He had a single-minded focus that had led to his success. He could be charming when it was to his advantage.</p> <p>And he was a ruthless bastard.</p><p>Phil had been waiting years for his brother to get what was coming to him. Years. The troubles currently plaguing California\u2019s wine industry had dominated the local news channels for weeks. Fan leaf virus was causing the ruin of many vineyards, and of course, Phil had wondered about Greg. But he hadn\u2019t heard anything definite until that very day. What he\u2019d learned made him eager to sing.</p><p>After all these years, it was payback time. Greg had deserted a woman in need; Phil hadn\u2019t known Catherine well, but he\u2019d liked her...and he\u2019d heard rumors about a pregnancy. Then, perhaps worst of all, Greg had ignored his own mother on her deathbed, and when Phil had confronted him, he hadn\u2019t shown any genuine remorse.</p><p>Naturally, because of his religious beliefs, Phil tried not to hate his brother. He was willing to admit, though, that he felt strongly antagonistic toward Greg, not to mention gleeful about his financial woes.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t missed the fact that the one place Greg hadn\u2019t come to apply for a loan was Pacific Union. A wise decision. Given the opportunity, Phil would have relished personally refusing his brother\u2019s application. More than that, he\u2019d done everything he could to make sure Greg didn\u2019t obtain funding. Actually, he\u2019d handled that situation in a pretty clever way. He\u2019d sent word through the banking community that when an application came to them from Bennett Wines, no one was to accept it. He\u2019d given the impression that he\u2019d be the one helping his brother.</p><p>If Sandy learned about this, she\u2019d be furious. She\u2019d accuse him of sabotaging Greg\u2019s business, but that wasn\u2019t how Phil viewed it. All he\u2019d done was make sure Greg didn\u2019t get anything he didn\u2019t deserve. It\u2019d probably be the first time, too. From childhood on, Greg had been the favored son. His fascination with that damned vineyard had guaranteed his special position with their father. And perhaps because he was the youngest, Greg had been coddled by their mother.</p> <p>Even when she was dying, she\u2019d made excuses for him. It was now ten years since they\u2019d buried their mother, and every time Phil thought about the funeral, the fury he still felt toward his brother threatened to consume him.</p><p>The grief Greg had shown was as phoney as a three-dollar bill. If he\u2019d cared even a little about their mother, he would have come to the hospital when she asked for him. They\u2019d known her illness was terminal! Nothing could have been more important; nothing should have kept him away. When Phil found out that Greg had chosen to attend the settlement hearing on his divorce case instead, he\u2019d completely lost his temper.</p><p>The two brothers had nearly come to blows at the wake. What irked Phil the most was the grieving-son act Greg had put on for family and friends.</p><p>Grieving? Yeah, right.</p><p>Phil had been appalled by the number of people who seemed to fall for Greg\u2019s act. Phil had been hurting, too, but he\u2019d disciplined himself not to show his emotions. Grief was private, after all. He\u2019d also grown accustomed to the reality of her death, because he\u2019d been there. His mother\u2019s illness had lasted several months, and Phil had been the one to sit at her bedside, to read to her and comfort her.</p><p>Sure, his brother had come to visit on occasion, but he always had a convenient excuse for not staying long. In the beginning it was because he was harvesting the grapes. That was followed by the wine-production period, which he said demanded constant supervision. During the last months of their mother\u2019s life, Greg had been involved in his divorce, too. His second divorce.</p><p>As far as Phil was concerned, his brother\u2019s marital problems were exactly what he deserved. The first wife, who\u2019d lasted ten years, was bad enough. The second one, who looked shockingly like the first, had stayed around three years, possibly four, he couldn\u2019t remember. Phil had heard that there was a third Mrs. Greg Bennett, and he couldn\u2019t help wondering if she\u2019d go the way of her predecessors.</p><p>\u201cPhil, hurry, or we\u2019re going to be late,\u201d Sandy called from the kitchen.</p> <p>They\u2019d finished dinner and washed their few dishes, and while Sandy was collecting the sheet music, Phil watched the last of the national news.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d he called back, turning off the TV. Preoccupied with thoughts of his brother, Phil hadn\u2019t heard a word of the newscast.</p><p>The church parking lot was only partially filled when they arrived. The choir director smiled in greeting, but didn\u2019t allow anyone to waste time. The Christmas cantata was only two weeks away, and there remained plenty of room for improvement.</p><p>The choir members gathered on the bleachers; as a tenor, Phil stood in the back row behind the women singing first soprano. It wasn\u2019t until they started the first song that he noticed the blonde standing directly in front of him. He\u2019d never heard anyone with a more spectacular voice. It was hard to remember his own part. The woman\u2019s clear strong voice was so stunning he was completely distracted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met,\u201d he said during the break.</p><p>She turned around and smiled. \u201cWe haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil Bennett,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I know quite a bit about you, Mr. Bennett.\u201d</p><p>This was something. Phil squared his shoulders a bit, feeling downright flattered by this lovely woman\u2019s interest.</p><p>The director was pleased with their performance and after an hour and a half, dismissed them for the night.</p><p>\u201cWe sounded quite good, didn\u2019t we?\u201d Sandy said on the drive home.</p><p>\u201cI thought so, too. By the way, who was the woman standing in front of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Hansen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the blonde.\u201d</p><p>His wife cast him a curious look. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any blonde standing in front of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there was. We spoke. You couldn\u2019t have missed her, Sandy. She had the most angelic voice. Really gifted.\u201d</p><p>Sandy laughed softly. \u201cAnd what was her name?\u201d</p><p>Phil hesitated, trying to remember. \u201cI don\u2019t believe she gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Although Sandy wasn\u2019t actually smiling, he heard the amusement in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you there was a blond woman standing in front of me, and she sang like no one I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, darling.\u201d</p><p>Women! If Sandy hadn\u2019t seen the blonde for herself, Phil couldn\u2019t make her believe she\u2019d been there. Next practice, he\u2019d be sure to introduce the woman to his wife. Then he\u2019d see what Sandy had to say.</p><p>Six</p><p>\u201cGoodness!\u201d Shirley waited until the church had emptied before chastising her fellow angel. She just didn\u2019t know how to handle Goodness and Mercy. Their antics were going to get them permanently expelled from earth. \u201cYou had to do it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>At least Goodness had the decency to look properly repentant. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I know you\u2019re right, but I couldn\u2019t stand the smug way Phil Bennett was acting. From the moment he heard about his brother\u2019s problems, he was beside himself with pleasure. All his talk about being a good Christian, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t here to deal with Phil Bennett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s part and parcel of what\u2019s happening to Greg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, and no...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry,\u201d Mercy told her. \u201cIf Gabriel\u2019s going to be upset with us, it\u2019ll be because of what happened with the hot-air balloon. Goodness singing in a church choir is minor compared to that.\u201d</p><p>Shirley had done her utmost to put the balloon episode out of her mind, and Mercy\u2019s reference did nothing to calm her already tattered nerves. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t remind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Gabriel didn\u2019t hear about that, then we don\u2019t need to\u2014\u201d Mercy stopped midsentence. A panic-stricken look came over her face, and she blinked several times before she said, \u201cOh...hello, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Gabriel,\u201d Goodness repeated, wide-eyed and subservient.</p><p>\u201cThe Archangel Gabriel to you,\u201d their boss said sternly.</p><p>Feeling slightly light-headed, Shirley turned around and swallowed nervously. She opened her mouth to offer a multitude of excuses and saw that it would do no good. Their chances of putting something over on the archangel were virtually nil.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for a progress report,\u201d he announced in the same controlled voice.</p><p>Goodness and Mercy both gazed pleadingly at Shirley, silently begging her to respond. She glared at them. When she tried to speak, her tongue seemed glued to the roof of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Gabriel muttered. \u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg talked to Catherine and he knows he fathered a son,\u201d Shirley blurted out.</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me that after thirty-five years, Greg just happened to stumble upon Catherine?\u201d Gabriel demanded.</p><p>Shirley was never sure how much Gabriel knew of their antics, but suspected he was aware of it all. The questions were most likely a test to see how much they\u2019d learned....</p><p>All three nodded in unison.</p><p>The archangel\u2019s frown darkened. \u201cThanks to a tableful of spilled crab, as I understand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that was only a means\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo an end,\u201d Gabriel completed for Mercy.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it worked very nicely, in my humble opinion,\u201d Goodness said in a bold rush. \u201cIt seemed a shame for the two of them to be in the same place after all those years and not know it. Really, all I did was point Greg out to Catherine. It was up to her to ignore or confront him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mercy agreed. \u201cGreg never did appreciate Catherine\u2019s strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019re telling me,\u201d Gabriel said thoughtfully, \u201cthat Catherine chose to face him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Again all three nodded as one.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s smile seemed involuntary. \u201cThe truth is, Catherine has Greg to thank for that inner strength. She gained it when he deserted her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might never have met again if it hadn\u2019t been for those spilled crabs.\u201d Goodness made her foolishness sound like an act of genius.</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t look pleased\u2014nor should he, Shirley reasoned. But that one antic had worked beautifully. She\u2019d admit it now, even though she hadn\u2019t approved at the time.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have anything else to report?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>The three glanced at one another and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been to visit Matthias in the Seattle area,\u201d Mercy told him in an offhand manner meant to suggest that Gabriel probably already knew about it. \u201cHe still hates Greg, but he\u2019s more concerned about his grandson\u2019s condition just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Gabriel said, frowning again. \u201cI\u2019ve heard something about that. Cancer, is it?\u201d</p><p>Shirley nodded. \u201cThe same form of leukemia that killed the boy\u2019s grandmother.\u201d Then, because she wanted to impress upon the archangel that their time on earth had been well spent, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been to see Greg\u2019s brother, as well. Phil Bennett. You remember him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Gabriel assured them. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize Goodness enjoyed singing in choirs as much as she does. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll volunteer to be part of the heavenly host next year\u2014is that correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Goodness waited desperately for Shirley to rescue her, but Shirley was in no mood to offer assistance. She might have leaped in to save her friend, if not for that escapade with the hot-air balloon. She felt mortified every time she thought about it. True, the sparkling wine had gone a long way toward tempering her anger, but...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to serve wherever assigned,\u201d Goodness stated with a woeful look in Shirley\u2019s direction.</p><p>Gabriel arched his brows as if to say her willingness surprised him. \u201cI find your attitude a refreshing change from when we last spoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSinging with the heavenly host isn\u2019t my favorite Christmas duty,\u201d Goodness was quick to add, \u201cbut I\u2019ll serve wherever you feel I\u2019d do best.\u201d</p><p>Once again Gabriel\u2019s expression implied that he was having trouble believing her. \u201cAnything else you\u2019d like to report?\u201d he finally asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot a thing,\u201d Shirley said, eager for him to be on his way.</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I can think of.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the three of them. \u201cAll right, then, carry on. Just remember there are less than three weeks until Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d they said in unison. They\u2019d made a lucky escape, Shirley felt. Gabriel hadn\u2019t even mentioned the hot-air balloon.</p><p>\u201cIt was very good of you to check up on us,\u201d Goodness said.</p><p>That was overdoing it, in Shirley\u2019s opinion. She resisted the urge to step on the other angel\u2019s foot.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Mercy chimed in. \u201cStop by again any time.\u201d For good measure, she added a small wave.</p> <p>Shirley sent both Goodness and Mercy looks potent enough to perm their hair.</p><p>Gabriel turned away, then abruptly turned back. \u201cI had no idea you three enjoyed wine.\u201d</p><p>Not one of them uttered a word. Shirley swallowed hard, certain they were going to be plucking harp strings on some cloud for the remainder of their careers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you happened to notice the label, did you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>No one answered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cIt was the Bennett label. Greg Bennett is a talented wine maker. It would be a pity for him to go out of business, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Not giving them the opportunity to respond, Gabriel whisked back to the realms of glory.</p><p>Greg Bennett had an aversion to the antiseptic smell that permeated hospitals. It nearly overpowered him the minute he walked through the large glass doors of San Francisco General. His dislike of hospitals was linked to his mother\u2019s long stay before her death, he supposed. That, and his own revulsion to needles and blood.</p><p>He paused at the information center.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d a much-too-perky candy striper asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhere might I find Dr. Edward Thorpe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re here about the article. That\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><p>Article? What article? Greg hadn\u2019t a clue, but he played along as if he did. His son had decided he didn\u2019t want to meet him, and that was his choice, but Greg wanted to see Edward. Needed to see him. He wasn\u2019t going to make an issue of it, wasn\u2019t going to announce who he was. He didn\u2019t plan to cause a scene or even call attention to himself. It was just that his curiosity had gotten the better of him....</p><p>Greg realized he\u2019d given up his parental rights years ago, but he couldn\u2019t leave matters as they were. Not now that he knew Catherine had borne the child.</p><p>Catherine had mentioned the physical resemblance between them, and Greg felt an urge to simply see his son. He doubted they\u2019d exchange a word. Without ever knowing him, without wanting to know him, Edward had rejected Greg.</p><p>Like father, like son.</p><p>\u201cTake the elevator to the fifth floor.\u201d The young woman at the information desk pointed toward the row of elevators on the opposite side of the lobby. \u201cTell the nurse at the desk that you\u2019re here for the blood test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Greg hesitated. Did she say blood? He was most definitely not interested in anything to do with blood.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful of you,\u201d she added with a sweetness that made him want to cringe.</p><p>Greg didn\u2019t feel wonderful. Furthermore, he had no intention of giving anyone a drop of his blood. Not without one hell of a fight first.</p><p>\u201cDr. Edward Thorpe\u2014you\u2019re sure he\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on the fifth floor,\u201d the woman assured him. \u201cJust ask for him at the nurses\u2019 station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, turning toward the bank of elevators.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she called after him.</p><p>Greg got off the elevator at the fifth floor and to his surprise walked into a corridor filled with people. As instructed, he headed for the nurses\u2019 station, but before he could say a word, he was handed a clipboard.</p><p>\u201cComplete the form, sign the bottom of the page and bring this back to me when you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>Greg stared at the woman. \u201cWhat\u2019s it for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need you to fill out the questionnaire and sign the release if we\u2019re going to take your blood.\u201d Unlike the perky candy striper, this one looked harassed and overworked.</p><p>\u201cI realize that, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust read the form. If you have any questions after that, I\u2019ll be happy to answer them.\u201d</p><p>That sounded fair enough. Greg joined the others, sat down and read the page. It was exactly what the nurse had said. Basically, San Francisco General was requesting permission to draw blood. Not that he\u2019d give it. Not in this lifetime.</p><p>As soon as he finished reading the form, he knew it was time to leave. He was about to pick himself up and discreetly disappear when a physician entered the room.</p><p>Conversation stopped as the man stood before the group and started to speak. Greg glanced up and froze. It was Edward. He recognized him immediately, long before he looked at the identification badge that hung around his neck.</p><p>\u201cHas everyone finished signing the waiver?\u201d Dr. Thorpe asked. \u201cIf you\u2019ve decided this isn\u2019t something that interests you, you can leave now. We appreciate your time. For those of you who wish to continue, we promise to make this as quick and painless as possible. Before you know it, you\u2019ll be on your way.\u201d</p><p>Three or four people left the room.</p><p>Greg could follow them or proceed with this. Swallowing his natural aversion, he quickly signed his name. Okay, so he had to give a little of his blood. No big deal. He\u2019d give a lot more if it meant he could spend a few minutes getting to know his son.</p><p>Catherine was right about one thing. Edward was tall and distinguished-looking, but as far as family resemblance went, Greg didn\u2019t see it. Still, he couldn\u2019t stop staring. This was his son. Edward looked good. Damn good. One glance had told Greg that his son was everything he wasn\u2019t. Dedicated. Compassionate. Smart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need that,\u201d the nurse said as Greg shuffled past.</p><p>He gave her the clipboard and walked down the corridor, along with the others.</p><p>\u201cBefore we go any farther,\u201d Edward said, \u201cI want to personally thank each of you for your generous response to the recent newspaper article. We didn\u2019t have this many volunteers in the entire month of November. I\u2019d like to think the Christmas spirit has touched us all. Does anyone have any questions?\u201d</p><p>A man with prematurely white hair raised his hand. \u201cWhat will happen if we\u2019re a match?\u201d</p><p>While Edward talked about obscure-sounding medical procedures, Greg leaned toward the woman standing ahead of him. \u201cA match for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBone marrow,\u201d she muttered out of the corner of her mouth, then turned to eye him. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re supposed to be here?\u201d</p><p>If ever a question needed answering, this was it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said more to himself than to her. He wasn\u2019t sure of anything. Curiosity had brought him to the hospital. A curiosity so deep it had consumed him for days. After thirty-five years of not knowing, not caring, he now felt an overwhelming desire to see his son.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d like to go first?\u201d</p><p>Before Greg could stop himself, he shot his hand into the air.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Follow me.\u201d Greg stepped out of the line and followed his son down the corridor to a cubicle.</p><p>\u201cThe nurse will be right in to draw blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to take it yourself?\u201d Greg asked. Already he could feel his panic level rise.</p><p>Edward shrugged lightly. \u201cWell...the nurse usually does this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer if you did it yourself. In fact, I insist on it.\u201d</p><p>Surprise showing in his eyes, Edward turned to face him. It seemed he was about to refuse, but for reasons Greg wouldn\u2019t question, silently led him to a chair and instructed him to sit down.</p><p>Greg sat, unbuttoned his shirtsleeve and rolled it up.</p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d Edward asked, studying him carefully.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Greg responded. \u201cDo I remind you of anyone?\u201d He was well aware that this was an unfair question.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I thought you might be a friend of my father\u2019s, Dr. Larry Thorpe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never met him.\u201d</p><p>Edward took a short piece of what looked like rubber tubing and tied it around Greg\u2019s upper arm. Next he gingerly tested the skin. \u201cNice blood vessels. We shouldn\u2019t have any problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Greg\u2019s mouth went dry at the sight of the needle, and closing his eyes, he looked away. This was even worse than the last time he\u2019d had blood tests. He felt the needle against his skin and braced himself for the small prick of pain. As a kid he\u2019d fainted in the doctor\u2019s office every time he received a shot or had blood drawn; he wasn\u2019t keen to relive the experience. That was years ago, but even now, as an adult, he generally avoided annual checkups if he could and\u2014The needle was the last thing he noticed until he heard Edward\u2019s voice, which seemed to boom at him like a foghorn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you awake?\u201d</p><p>Greg blinked and realized he was lying on the floor.

He would have fled, but the room had started to swim in the most disturbing fashion.</p><p>\u201cTake it slowly,\u201d Edward advised, then helped him stand up. \u201cI\u2019ve asked one of the nurses to take your blood pressure.

He wasn\u2019t fine and he hadn\u2019t eaten breakfast. \u201cI just don\u2019t happen to like needles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a brave thing you did, coming in here like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrave?\u201d Greg repeated with a short laugh. \u201cI\u2019m the biggest coward who ever lived.\u201d</p> <p>Seven</p><p>On Monday morning Greg recognized that he had no other options left to him. It wouldn\u2019t be easy to apply for a loan at Pacific Union Bank, but he had nowhere else to go. He\u2019d never been a person to beg. Never needed to beg until now, but if begging would help him hold on to Bennett Wines, he\u2019d do that and more.</p><p>The worst of it was that he\u2019d have to go begging to his own brother. Phil, who\u2019d like nothing better than to call him a failure. He wouldn\u2019t be far from wrong; Greg felt like a failure.</p><p>Despite his mood, Greg prepared carefully for the interview, wearing his best suit. He was about to head out the door when his phone rang. Caller ID told him it wasn\u2019t a creditor.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cHello, Greg.\u201d</p> <p>It was Tess, his almost ex-wife. Ex-wife number three. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you after another pound of flesh?\u201d he sneered. The last thing he needed right now was to deal with spoiled selfish Tess.</p><p>\u201cI heard about your money problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re gloating, too.\u201d</p><p>He heard her intake of breath. \u201cI don\u2019t wish you ill, Greg.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe her for a moment. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He was facing an unpleasant task that demanded all his attention, and he didn\u2019t want to be waylaid by an even more unpleasant one.</p><p>\u201cI called because I didn\u2019t realize the extent of your money problems until now and, well...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d told me earlier. If I\u2019d known, perhaps\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould it have made any difference?\u201d Their troubles had started long before the fan leaf virus had destroyed his vines. Long before he\u2019d been confronted with one financial crisis after another. He knew when he and Tess got married that they were probably making a mistake. Still, that hadn\u2019t stopped him. He\u2019d wanted her, and she\u2019d wanted the prestige of being married to him. True, they looked good together, but at the moment it seemed that was all they\u2019d had going for them.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like living alone, but he figured he\u2019d get used to it eventually.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer his probing question right away. \u201cIf I\u2019d known about your troubles, I like to think it would have changed things.\u201d</p><p>All women preferred to believe the best about themselves, he thought cynically. \u201cThink what you like,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cOh, Greg, do you hate me that much?\u201d</p><p>Her words caught him up short. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you at all,\u201d he said, and realized it was true. He was sorry to see the marriage end, but he hadn\u2019t been surprised and, in fact, had anticipated their divorce long before Tess moved out.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d She sounded surprised, but recovered quickly. \u201cGood, because I was thinking we should both do away with these attorneys and settle matters on our own. I can\u2019t afford three-hundred dollars an hour, and neither can you.\u201d</p><p>Greg wasn\u2019t sure he should put too much faith in this sudden change of heart. \u201cDo you mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, name a date and a time, and I\u2019ll be there.\u201d Greg hated the eagerness that crept into his voice, but he wanted the attorneys out of these divorce proceedings as much as Tess did. Without them\u2014stirring up animosities, asking for unreasonable concessions\u2014he and Tess had a chance of making this separation amicable.</p><p>\u201cHow about next Tuesday night?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>Greg noted the time and place and, with a farewell that verged on friendly, they ended the call.</p><p>Well, well. Life was full of surprises, and not all of them unpleasant.</p><p>The drive into the city, however, could only be called unpleasant. Traffic was heavy and Greg soon lost his patience, particularly when it took him nearly an hour to find parking, and that wasn\u2019t even close to the financial district. The cost of parking in San Francisco should be illegal, he grumbled to himself. This was his third trip into the city within ten days; he hadn\u2019t been to San Francisco three times in the entire previous year. Greg preferred his role as lord of the manor\u2014a role that was about to be permanently canceled if he couldn\u2019t secure a loan.</p><p>The sidewalks were crowded, since it was almost lunchtime. A brisk wind blew off the bay and he hunched his shoulders against it, ignoring the expensive-looking decorations on the bank buildings and the tasteful Christmas music floating out from well-appointed lobbies as doors were opened.</p><p>He sincerely hoped he wouldn\u2019t be forced to see Phil this early in the process, if at all. Knowing Phil as he did, Greg was keenly aware that his brother would take real pleasure in personally rejecting his application. Then again, he might exercise some modicum of mercy and leave it to someone else, a junior officer. But that wasn\u2019t something Greg needed to worry about just yet. Today was only the first step\u2014meeting with a loan officer and completing the lengthy application. Once he\u2019d finished the paperwork, he could leave. Walk out the doors of yet another bank, wait for yet another rejection.</p><p>He hated his own pessimistic attitude, but nothing had happened in the past week to give him any hope. His brother hated him\u2014it was that simple\u2014and Phil wasn\u2019t the kind of man to put their argument behind him. If he hadn\u2019t forgiven Greg in ten years, he wasn\u2019t likely to do it now.</p><p>Phil had always been somewhat jealous of him, Greg knew, something he\u2019d never really understood. Greg supposed his greatest sin was the fact that he\u2019d been born last. That, and sharing a passion for wine making with his father. Despite what Phil believed, Greg had loved their mother. Her death, although expected, had hit him hard.</p><p>He\u2019d had no way of knowing how critical her condition was. They\u2019d spoken briefly the night before, and while she\u2019d sounded weak, she\u2019d encouraged him to take care of his own business, to keep his appointment at court. So he\u2019d felt there was still plenty of time. She hadn\u2019t seemed that close to death.</p><p>His fight with Phil after the funeral had been the lowest point in his life. The truth was, Phil hadn\u2019t called him any name he hadn\u2019t called himself in the years since.</p><p>When Greg had finished with the loan application at Pacific Union, he walked back to the parking lot and paid the attendant what amounted to a ransom. But instead of heading for the St. Francis for a good stiff drink as was his custom, Greg drove to Viewcrest, the cemetery where his mother was buried.</p><p>He spent more than an hour wandering down long grassy rows in the biting wind before he located his mother\u2019s grave. He stood there, gazing down at the marker. Lydia Smith Bennett, 1930-1989 Beloved Mother. Phil had arranged for that stone. Phil had made all the arrangements.</p><p>This was Greg\u2019s first visit since they\u2019d buried her. He shook his head, brushing away tears, overwhelmed by all the things he\u2019d left unsaid. I loved you, Mom. I did. I do. I\u2019m sorry...</p><p>Eventually he squatted down, touched his fingers to his lips and pressed them to the marble gravestone. A long moment passed before he stood up again, shoulders bent, head bowed, and silently walked away.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone got a tissue?\u201d Mercy wailed, and when no one responded, she threw herself against Goodness, wiping her face on her friend\u2019s soft sleeve.</p><p>\u201cWould you kindly stop?\u201d</p><p>But Goodness sounded suspiciously tearful. Shirley, too, was having a hard time holding back her emotions. Seeing Greg like this, broken and defeated, was painful. She barely recognized him anymore. She didn\u2019t know when it had happened or how, but she\u2019d started to care about this man. Obviously Goodness and Mercy had also revised their feelings toward him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something to help Greg!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying,\u201d Shirley said.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s in bad shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling it\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d Shirley whispered, fearing the future.</p><p>\u201cSay it isn\u2019t so.\u201d Mercy wailed all the louder.</p><p>\u201cHis brother\u2019s going to reject the loan, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Shirley couldn\u2019t imagine Phil making any other decision and said as much.</p><p>\u201cNot if I have anything to say about it,\u201d Goodness cried. \u201cI think it\u2019s time I got ready for choir practice again, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if Gabriel sends me back to singing with the heavenly host or even gate-keeping. Phil Bennett is about to get a piece of my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Mercy gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Shirley began. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going, too.\u201d Mercy glanced at Shirley.</p><p>Shirley could see she had no choice. \u201cOh, all right, but we can\u2019t all three join the choir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Mercy asked, rushing to catch up with Goodness.</p><p>Shirley shook her head in wonder, sure they\u2019d be facing the wrath of Gabriel once again. She just hoped the sacrifice they were prepared to make on Greg Bennett\u2019s behalf would turn out to be worth it.</p><p>\u201cPhil, I swear you haven\u2019t heard a word I\u2019ve said all evening.\u201d</p><p>Phil lowered the evening newspaper and looked at his wife. \u201cWhat gives you that impression?\u201d</p><p>Sandy threw back her head with a frustrated groan and returned to the kitchen.</p><p>Reluctantly Phil followed her. He should have known better than to try bluffing his way out of this. After all these years of marriage, there wasn\u2019t much he could hide from Sandy. He was preoccupied, true. It had to do with his brother. His shiftless irresponsible no-good brother who\u2019d once been everyone\u2019s golden boy. Well, not anymore.</p><p>\u201cGreg was in the bank this afternoon,\u201d Phil told Sandy in a nonchalant voice, pouring himself a cup of coffee.</p><p>He had Sandy\u2019s full attention now. \u201cDid you talk to him?\u201d She knew as well as he did that they hadn\u2019t spoken since their mother\u2019s funeral.</p><p>\u201cNo-o-o.\u201d He shrugged and tried to look regretful. \u201cDave Hilaire was the one who dealt with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg\u2019s applying for a loan?\u201d</p><p>Phil replied with a somber nod, but he felt like jumping up and clicking his heels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been reading for weeks about the problems the wineries have been experiencing,\u201d Sandy said thoughtfully. \u201cIt must be terrible to have some virus wipe out generations of work. From what I read, some vineyards were more badly hurt than others.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGreg\u2019s vineyard is one of the worst hit,\u201d Phil explained in the same grave voice.</p><p>\u201cI wondered about Bennett Wines....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d He did his best to sound sympathetic.</p><p>Sandy studied him, her eyes narrowed, and Phil struggled to hide his true sentiments. This virus, or something like it, was exactly what he\u2019d been waiting for. Justice. Retribution. Revenge. Call it what you will. Phil had suspected that sometime or other, Greg would come crawling to him, asking for help. He\u2019d anticipated that day, longed for it.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to be able to get him the loan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know,\u201d Phil hedged. He could hardly admit that he\u2019d wear thong underwear in public before he\u2019d sign off on the money Greg needed.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll do what you can?\u201d Sandy gave him a hard look, and it was all he could do to meet her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, sounding as sincere as he could.</p><p>She sighed, then walked over to him and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cGood. I\u2019ve always hoped you two would put aside your differences.\u201d</p> <p>Phil hugged her rather than look her in the face. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all Greg has in the way of close family.\u201d</p><p>True, but that hadn\u2019t made any difference to his brother, and Phil didn\u2019t see why it should to him. Greg would come to him when he needed help and only because he needed help. So, any apology, any effort toward reconciliation, was tainted as far as Phil was concerned. Not that he intended to forgive his brother or had any interest in reconciling with him. It was too late for that. A just God would surely understand that some things were unforgivable. Wouldn\u2019t He?</p><p>\u201cPoor Greg,\u201d Sandy whispered.</p><p>Oh, yes, and Greg wouldn\u2019t know how truly poor he was until Phil had finished with him.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you weren\u2019t listening earlier,\u201d Sandy said, freeing herself from his embrace. \u201cYou had other things on your mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are going to help him, right?\u201d Sandy was obviously seeking reassurance.</p><p>He nodded, still without looking at her.</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019ll be busy with that, so let\u2019s skip the practice. I\u2019ll tell Evelyn we can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Evelyn was the choir director. \u201cCan\u2019t do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo caroling Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Phil said. \u201cWhy not? We don\u2019t have anything on the schedule, do we? None of the girls can come until Christmas morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you still want to?\u201d Sandy asked, sounding pleased.</p> <p>\u201cVery sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just hoping to see that blonde again, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she teased.</p><p>The blonde he\u2019d spoken with earlier in the week hadn\u2019t shown up for practice the last two times, and Phil was growing discouraged. She hadn\u2019t been a figment of his imagination, despite what Sandy claimed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I did just imagine her,\u201d he said to appease Sandy. \u201cI have to keep you on your toes, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be singing at the hospital Christmas Eve. San Francisco General.\u201d Sandy eyed him as though expecting Phil to change his mind.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d Not exactly his favorite place, but he could live with it.</p><p>Besides, singing carols for the sick was what Christmas was all about. This was the season of love and goodwill, and he had an abundant supply. Not for his brother, but that was Greg\u2019s own fault. \u201cAs a man sows, so shall he reap.\u201d That was somewhere in the Bible, and if anyone questioned his actions, Phil would happily quote it.</p><p>Oh, yes, his brother was getting exactly what he deserved.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Matthias stepped off the plane and walked through the long jetway to the terminal at San Francisco International Airport. He\u2019d come to spend Christmas with his grandson, fearing it would be the boy\u2019s last.</p><p>He spotted his daughter in the crowd and rushed toward her. \u201cGloria,\u201d he whispered, hugging her close. She\u2019d lost weight and looked pale and fragile. This was destroying her\u2014to watch her son dying, one day at a time. Matthias remembered how emotionally drained he\u2019d become when Mary had been so terribly ill. Gloria had suffered then, too\u2014and now she had to go through all this grief and pain again.... How could she bear it?</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy, I have wonderful news!\u201d his daughter exclaimed. \u201cA donor\u2019s been found.\u201d</p><p>The unexpected relief, the gratitude Matthias suddenly felt made him go weak. \u201cWhere?\u201d he asked hoarsely. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know his name. He\u2019s a stranger, someone who responded to the article in last week\u2019s newspaper about the need for volunteers. Dr. Thorpe says he\u2019s making the phone call this afternoon and the whole process should start before Christmas. Isn\u2019t that wonderful? Oh, Daddy, I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best Christmas gift anyone could have given me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Gloria\u2019s eyes shone with unshed tears. \u201cDr. Thorpe says the match is an especially good one. He sounded really hopeful, Dad. He didn\u2019t come right out and tell me this was going to save Tanner\u2019s life, but it is, I know it is. My heart tells me everything\u2019s going to be all right now.\u201d No longer did she struggle to hold back the tears. They fell unrestrained down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhen can I see this grandson of mine?\u201d Matthias asked, eager now to reach the hospital.</p><p>They chatted nonstop on the drive into the city. When they got to the hospital, they hurried to the eighth floor. Weak as he was, ten-year-old Tanner was sitting up in bed waiting for Matthias.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Grandpa.\u201d His pale face was wreathed in an extra-wide grin, although his eyes were sunken and shadowed.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Tanner.\u201d Matthias hugged his grandson, careful not to hurt the fragile little body. Seeing him like this was hard. So hard.</p><p>\u201cGrandpa, are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only because I\u2019m happy.\u201d Matthias glanced up and smiled apologetically at his daughter and the young nurse who stood beside her.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be all right now,\u201d Gloria assured him again, and Matthias believed her. Everything was going to be better.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Greg snapped into the small cellular phone. He\u2019d never enjoyed talking on the telephone and was particularly annoyed by these new-fangled cell things.</p><p>\u201cIs this Greg Bennett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Again his voice was as sharp and short-tempered as he could make it. He was walking between the rows of dead and dying grapevines, recognizing with final certainty that nothing was salvageable. No one could save what had taken fifty years to build.</p><p>\u201cThis is Dr. Edward Thorpe from San Francisco General.\u201d</p><p>Greg was so shocked he nearly dropped the phone. \u201cYes...Dr. Thorpe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you\u2019d be willing to come back to the hospital later this afternoon?\u201d His voice was pleasant, smooth, and if Greg wasn\u2019t mistaken, there was a hint of relief, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d Greg told him immediately.</p><p>\u201cI realize it\u2019s short notice and this is the Christmas season, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d Greg interrupted. \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs three o\u2019clock convenient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Then he couldn\u2019t resist asking, \u201cCan you tell me what this is about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer we discuss it once you get here.\u201d He ended the conversation by giving Greg detailed instructions on where and how to reach him at the hospital.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at three,\u201d Greg said, then slipped the phone back into his shirt pocket. He drew in a deep breath, releasing it slowly.</p><p>Somehow, some way, Edward had discovered the truth about their relationship. Apparently his son had experienced a change of heart and decided to meet his biological father, after all.</p><p>Although Greg could offer no excuse for what he\u2019d done to Catherine, he was grateful for Edward\u2019s decision. He did want Edward to know that he was proud to have fathered him, proud of the man he\u2019d become. Greg could claim no credit; Edward owed him nothing. He only hoped that one day his son would be able to forgive him. He\u2019d like a relationship with him, but wouldn\u2019t ask. That, like everything else, was up to Edward.</p><p>The drive into the city was becoming almost routine by now. Greg found he was nervous and at the same time excited. He parked where Edward had suggested and followed the directions he\u2019d been given. Not until he was in the elevator did he realize the hospital\u2019s antiseptic smell hadn\u2019t overpowered him. That, he decided, was a good sign.</p><p>Edward was waiting when he arrived and personally escorted him into his office. Greg noted with some satisfaction that Edward was as tidy and organized as he was himself. The physician\u2019s desktop held a pen-and-pencil set, a clock and a computer monitor. On the credenza behind him was a small collection of framed photographs. He recognized Catherine in one, beside a tall gray-haired man, obviously her husband.</p><p>\u201cYour wife?\u201d Greg asked, looking past him to the gold-framed photograph of a younger woman.</p><p>Edward nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been married three times,\u201d Greg blurted out, then wanted to kick himself.</p><p>His son had the good grace to ignore that comment. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ve guessed why I asked you to stop by the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Greg liked the fact that Edward was forthright enough to get to the point immediately. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, and seemed to relax. \u201cThat being the case, I\u2019d like to introduce you to someone very special.\u201d</p><p>Greg hesitated. \u201cNow?\u201d To his mind, there were several things they should discuss before he met anyone important in Edward\u2019s life, but he was willing to let his son chart their course.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Greg was simply grateful for this unexpected opportunity. His miserable attempt to see Edward earlier in the week had failed and humiliated him. Thankfully, Edward hadn\u2019t seen fit to remind him of what had happened at their last meeting.</p><p>Edward led him to the elevators and together they rode silently up several floors. They stopped at what appeared to be a children\u2019s ward. Greg frowned. Without asking any questions, he followed Edward to a room at the end of the corridor.</p><p>\u201cThis is Tanner Westley,\u201d Edward whispered, nodding toward the sleeping youngster.</p><p>From the tubes and other medical equipment linked to the emaciated body, Greg could tell the boy was gravely ill.</p><p>\u201cShould I know him?\u201d Greg asked, also in a whisper.</p><p>Edward shook his head. \u201cLet\u2019s return to my office and I\u2019ll explain the procedure.\u201d</p><p>Procedure? Greg wasn\u2019t sure he understood, but he accompanied Edward back to his office.</p><p>When they entered the room and resumed their seats, Edward said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how delighted I was that you proved to be a match for Tanner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBone-marrow match,\u201d he said, eyeing Greg closely. \u201cI assumed you understood the reason for my call.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. No way.\u201d Before he knew it, Greg was on his feet, emphatically shaking his head. \u201cYou want me to be a bone-marrow donor? This is a joke, right? You saw for yourself what happens any time I have blood taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did come into the hospital for the test. Surely you realized\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell you\u2019re going to get me to agree to this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, sit down.\u201d Edward motioned calmly to the chair.</p> <p>He made an effort to fight back his disappointment. This meeting had nothing to do with Edward wanting to know his birth father\u2014it was all about what he could do to help some stranger. Greg continued to shake his head. No amount of talk, even from his son, would convince him to let someone stick another needle in his arm. Or anyplace else, for that matter.</p><p>\u201cBefore you refuse, let me explain the procedure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of talking me into this,\u201d Greg felt obliged to tell him. He sat down, crossing his arms defensively.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks from now, Tanner will be placed in an aseptic room where all his bone-marrow cells, both the good ones and the bad ones, will be destroyed by high doses of chemicals and radiation. This is the only way we have of completely eradicating the malignant cells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc, listen\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me finish, please, and if you still feel the same way after that, then...well, then we can talk.\u201d</p><p>Greg groaned silently and saw that he had no choice but to listen. Once Edward was finished, he would make some excuse and leave by the fastest route possible.</p><p>\u201cThis will be a dangerous time for Tanner, when he\u2019s most susceptible to infection.</p><p>\u201cOn the day of the transplant, the bone marrow will be extracted from you and stored in a blood bag, then intravenously transfused into Tanner over the course of several hours.\u201d He paused and studied Greg, who sat quietly, without moving. \u201cDo you want to ask me about the pain or how the marrow is extracted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d He didn\u2019t need to know, didn\u2019t care to know, seeing that it wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>\u201cMost people are curious about the pain, and rightly so. I won\u2019t deny that there is some discomfort involved in this process, but I like to tell my donors that it never hurts to save a life.\u201d</p> <p>Apparently Edward hadn\u2019t heard him correctly the first time. Greg wasn\u2019t doing this. Couldn\u2019t do this.</p><p>\u201cI want to schedule the procedure as quickly as possible. As you can see, Tanner\u2019s health is failing.\u201d</p><p>Greg stared at him, wondering why Edward refused to understand. \u201cDon\u2019t schedule anything for me. You\u2019ll just have to find another donor.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Edward\u2019s turn to wear a shocked disbelieving look. \u201cYou really won\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t my life or your life you\u2019re sacrificing. It\u2019s that young boy\u2019s. He\u2019ll die without a bone-marrow transplant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find another donor.\u201d Greg stood, desperate to escape.</p><p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t.\u201d Edward stood, too. \u201cDo you think just anyone can supply the bone marrow for Tanner? If that was the case, I\u2019d give him my own\u2014but it\u2019s not. There has to be a match. You\u2019re that match.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t see how I can be,\u201d Greg said stubbornly. He wasn\u2019t any relation to the boy.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you sign the release and agree to have your blood tested if you weren\u2019t willing to be a donor?\u201d Edward raised his voice.</p><p>Greg dared not tell him the truth, dared not announce the real reason he\u2019d come to the hospital.</p><p>\u201cDid you take a good look at Tanner?\u201d Edward asked. \u201cHe\u2019s only ten. He could be your son or even mine, and he\u2019s only got a very small chance of living without your bone marrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with my marrow?\u201d Greg couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d even asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a much greater likelihood that he\u2019ll see another Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Greg slumped back in the chair and covered his eyes with the heels of his hands. He didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cIs he going to do it?\u201d Mercy cried, pacing the area directly behind Edward\u2019s desk. \u201cI can\u2019t stand not knowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush! I can\u2019t hear.\u201d Goodness waved a quieting arm at Mercy.</p><p>\u201cShirley, do you know?\u201d Mercy asked.</p><p>Shirley shook her head.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to refuse?\u201d Mercy collapsed against a bookcase. \u201cHas the man no heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you kindly stop that noise?\u201d Goodness warned a second time. \u201cI can\u2019t hear a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re arguing,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cAnd poor Greg has no way of knowing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Tanner is Matthias\u2019s grandson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not just that,\u201d Shirley said sadly. The irony here had God\u2019s fingerprints all over it.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Goodness paused to look in Shirley\u2019s direction, clearly puzzled.</p><p>\u201cWhat Greg doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Shirley told her two friends, \u201cis that the boy is more than Matthias\u2019s grandson. He\u2019s Greg\u2019s chance for redemption.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>Phil and Sandy Bennett arrived five minutes late for choir practice. Weaving his way between choir members, Phil climbed into his position on the riser, frazzled and irritated with his wife. Sandy might not have intended to make him feel guilty about Greg\u2014but somehow he did. Well, not guilty exactly. A little uncomfortable, perhaps.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he opened the sheet music and started singing along with the others that he heard her. The blonde who sang first soprano was back! Gradually the tension between his shoulder blades relaxed. He knew it; she hadn\u2019t been imaginary at all. He waited until the last notes had died down, then casually leaned forward to speak to her.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d he asked her, unable to disguise his excitement. Before she could answer, he asked another question. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d It would have helped if he\u2019d had a name to give Sandy. She knew a lot more of the choir members than he did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a member of the choir, though, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Her hair was so blond it was almost white, and her singing voice... Phil had never known anyone who could sing quite like this woman. Her voice had a power and beauty that was almost unearthly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to introduce you to my wife,\u201d he said while they shuffled through their sheet music, preparing for the next carol.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your brother?\u201d she asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to introduce me to him, too?\u201d</p><p>The music started before Phil had a chance to recover. \u201cYou know my brother?\u201d he asked as soon as the last notes had died away.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I know a lot about you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d He didn\u2019t like the turn their conversation was taking.</p><p>\u201cA friend.\u201d</p><p>Phil was beginning to wonder about that.</p><p>\u201cYou have Greg\u2019s loan application on your desk, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>How she knew that, he wouldn\u2019t ask. He\u2019d been reading it that very afternoon just before he\u2019d left the office, but only one person in the entire loans department was aware of it. He narrowed his gaze and studied this woman, who seemed to know more about him than she should.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t forgiven him for what he did to your mother, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it might surprise you to learn that he hasn\u2019t forgiven himself, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPigs will fly before I believe he has one iota of remorse.\u201d</p><p>Frieda Barney turned around and glared at Phil. Someone else indicated her displeasure with his talking by pressing her finger to her lips. From the opposite end of the riser he could feel his wife\u2019s look burn right through him.</p><p>The music started again and Phil did his best to remain focused on it. The warmth he\u2019d felt toward the beautiful willowy blonde had evaporated. By some corrupt means, his brother had finagled this...this spy into the church choir one week before Christmas. Greg always had been a good manipulator.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t spoken to him in all these years.\u201d A second voice came from beside him. This woman was slightly taller than the other. A second blonde? And one who sang? That didn\u2019t make sense. He closed his eyes, then opened them again, thinking he was losing his mind.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded in an angry whisper.</p><p>\u201cThe more appropriate question would be who are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d the second woman asked. \u201cDo you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always thought of yourself as the good brother,\u201d the first soprano chided.</p><p>\u201cThe churchgoer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe choir member.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet all the while you\u2019ve been plotting your brother\u2019s downfall, relishing it. You can hardly wait to see him suffer.\u201d</p><p>Female voices were coming at him from every direction. Not one voice, not even two, but three distinct voices. He thought he\u2019d go mad if he heard another word. \u201cWould you kindly shut up.\u201d</p><p>The room abruptly went silent. Everyone turned to stare at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Phil mumbled. He could feel the heat rush into his face as he returned his attention to his music. He didn\u2019t know what had come over him.</p><p>Evelyn, the choir director, looked at him sternly. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>The director asked the altos to go over a particularly tricky piece of music while the others waited. They\u2019d just sung the first line when the blondes started in on him again. \u201cIt\u2019s the season of brotherly love,\u201d the one beside him said. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to wonder if you know what that means.\u201d</p><p>Phil ignored her, refusing to let his gaze waver from Evelyn. At last the choir director motioned for the other sections to join in. These spies of Greg\u2019s could say and do what they wished, Phil thought, but he wasn\u2019t going to listen.</p><p>\u201cYou hide behind a cloak of decency all the while plotting your brother\u2019s downfall,\u201d the first blonde sang, the words fitting the music perfectly.</p><p>Phil\u2019s breath caught. He sincerely hoped no one else could hear these ridiculous lyrics.</p><p>\u201cThe good brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe churchgoer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe choir member.\u201d</p><p>These three lines were sung as solos. The words seemed to linger in the air long after they\u2019d been sung. Phil was convinced everyone knew the taunts were meant for him. Angry and embarrassed, he was about to get down off the riser and escape when he noticed the blonde beside him had vanished. He looked toward the row of first sopranos and saw that the other one was gone, as well. He\u2019d never even seen where the third one had stood. How they\u2019d left he didn\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t care. Good riddance. His relief was almost palpable.</p><p>Sandy began to berate him the minute they were in the car. \u201cYour behavior tonight was appalling,\u201d she said angrily. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing.\u201d The car engine roared to life and he drove out of the church parking lot, eager to put the entire episode behind him.</p><p>\u201cTelling Evelyn to shut up was probably the rudest thing you\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to Evelyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf not Evelyn, then who?\u201d</p> <p>Phil exhaled sharply. \u201cThe blonde.\u201d</p><p>Sandy was quiet for a long moment\u2014unfortunately not long enough to suit Phil. \u201cWhat blonde?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one standing in front of me. Actually, there were two blondes. No, three, only I didn\u2019t see the third, only heard her.\u201d</p><p>Once more his wife grew quiet. \u201cPhil, there wasn\u2019t any blonde standing in front of you,\u201d she finally said. \u201cNo blonde singing first soprano.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there was.\u201d He didn\u2019t know how Sandy could be so blind. Did she honestly think he\u2019d make up something like this? \u201cGreg sent them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreg? Your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else would do anything so underhanded?\u201d</p><p>Silence again. Sandy didn\u2019t seem to believe him, which irritated Phil even more. Of course Greg was behind this. He\u2019d put those women up to mocking him in front of his wife and all these other people\u2014and then disappearing. This was exactly the type of stunt his brother would pull, but Phil wasn\u2019t going to stand for it. Oh, no. If Greg was planning to make trouble for him, he\u2019d be ready.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Greg have to do with any of this?\u201d Sandy asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s paid them to spy on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Phil, that\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey had to be spies to know the things they did. Only someone who\u2019s been watching me would know I have Greg\u2019s loan application on my desk. Furthermore these women seemed to know how much I\u2019m looking forward to turning him down.\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant to say all of that, but it was too late now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re rejecting Greg\u2019s loan application.\u201d The accusation in his wife\u2019s voice stung.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a bad credit risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, this is your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy selfish arrogant brother.\u201d Apparently his wife needed to be reminded of that. \u201cEven at the end of her life, Mom was making excuses for him. Don\u2019t you start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous, aren\u2019t you? Both your parents are long dead, and you still think they loved your brother more than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did.\u201d It was a fact he\u2019d lived with his entire life.</p><p>\u201cGreg has come to you looking for help. It couldn\u2019t have been easy for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to get any easier, either,\u201d Phil snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou sound...happy about it.\u201d</p><p>Phil entered the ramp leading to the freeway with a burst of speed, pushing the accelerator all the way to the floor.</p><p>Sandy waited until they were moving smoothly along with the traffic. \u201cGreg\u2019s your brother,\u201d she said again. \u201cAnd you have the power to help him.\u201d</p><p>Phil tightened his hands on the steering wheel. \u201cYou\u2019re beginning to sound just like those blondes, singing their solos, humiliating me in front of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blondes sang?\u201d Sandy sounded worried.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say you didn\u2019t hear them, either?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sandy said. \u201cShould I have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...no.\u201d Maybe it wasn\u2019t as bad as he\u2019d first thought. \u201cYou\u2019re not just saying that, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaying what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you didn\u2019t hear them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Sandy assured him. \u201cBut I still want to know what they said.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAccording to them, I like to think of myself as the good son and I wear a cloak of decency while plotting against my brother. Something like that.\u201d Phil checked the speedometer and realized he was speeding. As he slowed the car, he glanced at his wife, only to discover that she was staring intently at him. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me my own wife agrees with them!\u201d</p><p>Sandy didn\u2019t answer, but her silence said it all.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and be angry,\u201d he said, and noted he was speeding again. He seemed in an all-fired hurry to get home and he wasn\u2019t sure why. If anything, this argument was bound to escalate once they got there.</p><p>\u201cI can only imagine how difficult it must have been for Greg to come to Pacific Union,\u201d Sandy said not for the first time. \u201cEspecially when he knew that you\u2019d be the one who\u2019d ultimately accept or reject his loan application.\u201d</p><p>Phil refused to dignify her comments with a response.</p><p>\u201cGreg is coming to you for help.\u201d</p><p>Despite himself, Phil snorted with laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh, Phil, how could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d</p><p>Right after Christmas he intended to call Greg into the bank. He\u2019d leave him to wait and wonder during the holidays. When his brother arrived at the bank, Phil would have him escorted into his office. It would be the first time they\u2019d been face-to-face since their mother\u2019s funeral.</p><p>Then he was going to personally deliver the news.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Christmas Eve Matthias stopped at the hospital following his grandson\u2019s bone-marrow procedure. Gloria had spent the day with Tanner and called to tell Matthias that the transplant had gone well. Tanner was in an aseptic room Matthias couldn\u2019t enter. Only Tanner\u2019s mother was allowed to visit, and even then the boy was kept behind a protective plastic barrier. Despite that, Matthias couldn\u2019t think of anyplace in the world he\u2019d rather celebrate Christmas.</p><p>Because of the unknown bone-marrow donor, they actually had something to celebrate. The change in Gloria since the donor had been located was dramatic. The edge of fear was gone from her voice, and color had returned to her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Gloria waved to attract his attention when he walked into the hospital lobby.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, sweetheart.\u201d He kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cDad, Tanner\u2019s donor is still here. Everything went as expected, but when he stood up to leave, he blacked out and fell against the hospital bed. He\u2019s got quite a gash on his head.\u201d</p><p>The donor had asked to remain anonymous and had given up today\u2014Christmas Eve\u2014for Tanner\u2019s sake. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. Is he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. Said he felt foolish for causing all this fuss. He\u2019s in the emergency room, waiting for his wife to pick him up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to thank him personally,\u201d Matthias said. \u201cDo you think he\u2019d mind?\u201d This stranger, who\u2019d responded to a newspaper article, had given his grandson a second chance at life. The only reward he\u2019d received for his effort had been a cut on the head\u2014and the grateful appreciation of Tanner\u2019s family. The least Matthias could do was sit with him until his wife got there.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll go and talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll go up to Tanner again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Matthias said. He followed the sign that pointed to the emergency room; it led him to a large waiting area. Groups of people were scattered about. A lone man sat in a shadowy corner, his forehead bandaged. That had to be him.</p><p>He walked over. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Matthias Jamison, Tanner Westley\u2019s grandfather, and I\u2014\u201d Matthias didn\u2019t finish. He couldn\u2019t finish. All he could do was gape at the man he\u2019d hated for fifteen years.</p><p>\u201cMatthias, is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg?\u201d</p><p>In shock, they stared at each other for the better part of a minute.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Tanner\u2019s grandfather?\u201d Greg finally asked.</p><p>Matthias nodded.</p><p>Apparently Greg hadn\u2019t known of the connection between him and Tanner. The anger and hatred Matthias had lived with all these years flared back to life, racing through his blood like a shot of adrenaline. But to his surprise, it died a quick and sudden death.</p><p>Matthias claimed the chair across from Greg, astonished that he couldn\u2019t think of a single word to say.</p><p>\u201cThat explains it,\u201d Greg said, slowly shaking his head.</p><p>Matthias had no idea what he was talking about.</p><p>\u201cNow I understand why I was a match for Tanner. It\u2019s because you and I are second cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you really didn\u2019t know? That Tanner\u2019s my grandson?\u201d Matthias had to ask.</p><p>Greg smiled wryly. \u201cNot a clue. You\u2019re telling me that was Gloria I talked to a few minutes ago? Your Gloria...and Mary\u2019s?\u201d As soon as he spoke, he seemed to regret bringing up Mary\u2019s name. \u201cShe\u2019s certainly changed from the little girl who used to race up and down the vineyard rows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d</p><p>Greg nodded. He splayed his fingers through his hair and winced when he touched the bandaged gash. His hair was almost completely gray now, but it looked good on him. \u201cShe isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve both changed,\u201d Matthias murmured, and leaned forward to rest his elbows on his knees.</p><p>\u201cAbout Mary,\u201d Greg whispered. \u201cI...I was wrong. I\u2019ve thought of Mary, of you, so often...\u201d He seemed unable to continue.</p><p>Emotion blocked Matthias\u2019s throat. It\u2019d been so long since he\u2019d cried that when the tears filled his eyes, they burned and stung like acid. Embarrassed, he blinked hard and looked away. \u201cShe died fifteen years ago and I still miss her. Doesn\u2019t seem right not having Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you forgive me?\u201d Greg\u2019s voice was raw with pain.</p><p>\u201cThe Lord takes away, but He also gives. Mary\u2019s gone, but because of you, young Tanner\u2019s got a real chance at beating the same cancer that killed his grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Bennett.\u201d Tanner\u2019s doctor joined them. Judging by the way he was dressed, he was about to leave. Not that Matthias begrudged him that, seeing as it was Christmas Eve. Edward, like everyone else, wanted to be with his family. \u201cI just heard about your accident and I came to tell you how sorry I am.\u201d</p><p>Matthias, for one, was grateful for the distraction. It gave him a moment to compose himself.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry,\u201d Greg said, as if the stitches in his head were of little significance. \u201cIt\u2019ll be healed in no time. Besides, I should\u2019ve known better than to stand up without the nurse there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did warn you not to be in too much of a hurry.\u201d The doctor smiled, then glanced at Matthias. \u201cI see you two have met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re old friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCousins, actually,\u201d Greg added, and because they needed an excuse to laugh they both did.</p><p>\u201cI see...\u201d the doctor said. \u201cYou have a ride coming for you?\u201d he asked Greg next.</p><p>\u201cYes. My wife will be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything else I can do for you, don\u2019t hesitate to let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Greg promised.</p><p>Dr. Thorpe nodded. \u201cI probably won\u2019t be seeing you again, Mr. Bennett, but I want you to know that I think you did a brave thing. A selfless thing. Thank you.\u201d With that he held out his hand. Greg stood and clasped it firmly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he returned.</p><p>Greg slumped back into his chair, eyes on the retreating physician. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine young man, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Matthias heard a catch in his voice. \u201cOne of the best cancer specialists around.\u201d Gloria had repeatedly told him of the wonderful caring physician who\u2019d been so good to Tanner and to her.</p><p>Greg\u2019s gaze lingered on Dr. Thorpe and his expression was oddly pained.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Matthias asked.</p><p>Greg\u2019s nod was slow in coming. \u201cI will be.\u201d</p><p>Not understanding, Matthias frowned. \u201cYou want to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps someday,\u201d Greg mumbled.</p><p>The tension was broken by the sound of carolers. \u201cJoy to the World\u201d drifted toward them, the music festive and lively, a dramatic contrast to their current mood.</p> <p>\u201cIs it close to Christmas?\u201d Greg asked, seemingly unaware.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve,\u201d Matthias told him.</p><p>Greg\u2019s eyes widened with surprise. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize...\u201d</p><p>The music made for a pleasant background as the two men continued to talk, mostly about Tanner and Gloria. Several minutes later Matthias brought up the subject of the vineyard. \u201cI read about the fan leaf problems in your area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wiped me out,\u201d Greg said.</p><p>That accounted for his cousin\u2019s haggardness and his beleaguered look, Matthias thought.</p> <p>\u201cA lifetime of work destroyed in a single season,\u201d Greg murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re replanting of course.\u201d</p><p>Greg shook his head. \u201cTakes capital, more capital than I can muster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a loan. That\u2019s what banks are for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I haven\u2019t tried?\u201d Greg\u2019s voice rose. \u201cI\u2019m not a poor risk, at least not on paper, but money\u2019s tight. Tighter than I realized. Despite everything, I haven\u2019t been able to convince a single bank to give me a loan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working with Columbia Wines up in Washington. The vines there are stronger, more resilient. Say the word and I can arrange for you to replant with those.\u201d</p><p>Greg shook his head again. \u201cHell, I\u2019m sixty. Too damn old to start over now. Lately I\u2019ve been thinking of selling out completely and hiring on with one of the other wineries.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the answer, as Matthias was well aware. \u201cYou never could tolerate working for others. You like being your own boss too much. Besides, you\u2019re still young. I\u2019m damn near seventy and I don\u2019t think of myself as old.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t get the financing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Phil? He works for a bank, doesn\u2019t he? He should be able to help you.\u201d</p><p>Greg shook his head. \u201cHe has as much reason to hate me as you do.\u201d</p><p>The carolers drew closer, drowning out any chance of further conversation. Matthias could only imagine what had caused such a rift between the two brothers.</p><p>Memory told him that Phil had always resented Greg\u2019s good looks, his social skills and sense of purpose. Whatever happened had been building for years. Matthias didn\u2019t doubt that Greg had played a role\u2014but Phil had already been holding a grudge. Looking for a reason to justify his resentment.</p><p>Then, without warning, Greg rose slowly to his feet, almost as if he was being drawn upward against his will.</p><p>Matthias looked up and then he knew.</p><p>Phil saw his brother and Matthias at the same time as Greg saw him. His first reaction was shock, followed by unexpected compassion. Greg\u2014head bandaged, features pale and drawn\u2014stood beside Matthias Jamison, of all people.</p><p>Hardly conscious of what he was doing, Phil stopped singing. Sandy did, too. Slowly, involuntarily, he separated himself from the band of carolers. Almost before he realized his intent, he stood silently before his brother. They stared at each other, eye to eye.</p><p>Neither man spoke. For his part Phil couldn\u2019t find the words. This was what he\u2019d wanted, what he\u2019d dreamed about\u2014seeing his brother, his sophisticated suave rich brother, broken and humbled. Greg was certainly humbled, but to his own amazement, Phil experienced no glee at the sight.</p><p>He was incapable of speaking. His mind had emptied, but his heart had grown suddenly full. His eyes filled with tears, and he struggled to hold everything inside.</p><p>Then, wordlessly, compulsively, the two brothers strained toward each other and hugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Phil asked when they broke apart. He was looking at his brother\u2019s bandage.</p><p>As if he\u2019d forgotten, Greg touched his head. \u201cNothing much. It\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatthias,\u201d Phil said, glancing toward his cousin, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you still lived in California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I came to see my family\u2014and to thank Greg. He was the bone-marrow donor for my grandson.\u201d</p><p>Greg had voluntarily given his bone marrow? Phil remembered his brother\u2019s aversion to needles\u2014the way he\u2019d always fainted in the doctor\u2019s office whenever he had to get a shot.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Clearly Greg was flustered. \u201cI was a match for the boy. Matthias is our dad\u2019s cousin, remember?\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Matthias asked.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Phil told him, and the two exchanged hearty handshakes.</p><p>\u201cYou still work for Pacific Union, don\u2019t you?\u201d Matthias asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Phil already knew what his cousin was about to ask.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you help Greg get the financing he needs to replant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to answer him?\u201d Sandy whispered, slipping her hand into the crook of his arm. Phil was sure the two men hadn\u2019t heard. He was reminded of other voices he\u2019d heard that apparently no one else had. You hide behind a cloak of decency...The good brother...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it that you get your loan,\u201d Phil said, looking directly at Greg. \u201cDrop in after the holidays to sign the paperwork, and I\u2019ll arrange for the transfer of funds.\u201d</p><p>Greg just stared at him. \u201cPhil,\u201d he began hesitantly, \u201cyou\u2019d do that for me after...\u201d Words failed him.</p><p>\u201cIt seems we both had a lot of growing up to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Greg said, his voice choked and low.</p><p>\u201cGreg!\u201d cried a female voice from across the room.</p><p>Phil turned and saw a stunningly beautiful woman at least twenty years his brother\u2019s junior come racing across the emergency-room waiting area. \u201cOh, darling, just look at you.\u201d</p><p>Greg smiled as the woman ran one hand down the side of his face and inspected the damage to his head. \u201cHow did this happen? Omigosh, you can\u2019t imagine what I thought when the nurse phoned.\u201d</p><p>Not answering, Greg placed his arm around the woman and turned to Matthias, Phil and Sandy. \u201cThis is Tess, my wife,\u201d he said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cHello, Tess,\u201d Sandy said, and in that warm welcoming way of hers, extended an invitation to Christmas dinner. Matthias and Gloria were included, too; Gloria would be with Tanner for part of the day, but Matthias thought she could join them for a few hours.</p><p>\u201cCan we, darling?\u201d Tess opened her eyes wide. \u201cYou know how much I hate to cook. Besides, it\u2019s time I met your family, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Greg nodded, still smiling.</p><p>The women started talking, and soon it was impossible to get a word in, but Phil didn\u2019t mind. And from the looks of it, neither did Greg or Matthias.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the most incredible sight you\u2019ve ever seen?\u201d Goodness said from her perch atop the hospital light fixture. Shirley and Mercy sat with her, nudging each other as they jostled for space.</p><p>Seeing Greg with his brother, his cousin and his wife was heady stuff, indeed. Shirley couldn\u2019t have wished for more. Despite their antics, everything had worked out beautifully, and this hadn\u2019t been an easy case. Gabriel had made sure of that.</p><p>\u201cI see you three are mighty pleased with yourselves,\u201d the archangel said as he appeared beside them.</p><p>\u201cWe did it,\u201d Mercy told him with more than a hint of pride.</p><p>\u201cAnd all without involving the FBI or the National Guard,\u201d Goodness was pleased to report.</p><p>\u201cThere was that one minor incident with a hot-air balloon, though,\u201d Gabriel reminded her. \u201cThe Federal Aviation Administration is still looking into it.\u201d</p><p>Shirley noticed that her friends had suddenly gone quiet. \u201cAll in all, it\u2019s been a challenge.\u201d They\u2019d brought the case to a successful conclusion, but Shirley was convinced it had taken more than a little heavenly intervention. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to Greg?\u201d she asked, curious to learn what the future held for the man she\u2019d once thought of as despicable. In time she\u2019d actually come to like him and wish him well. He wasn\u2019t as bad as he\u2019d seemed at first glance, and she wondered if this was the real lesson Gabriel had been hoping to teach them.</p><p>\u201cWell, as you can see he\u2019s mending fences with Tess,\u201d Gabriel said. Greg had his arm around his wife as they stood and talked to Matthias, Phil and Sandy.</p><p>\u201cSo their settlement meeting went well,\u201d Shirley murmured.</p><p>\u201cReally well,\u201d Mercy said, grinning widely. \u201cOkay, okay, so I joined them for a few minutes. Trust me, the meeting went better than either of them expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting back together,\u201d Gabriel continued, \u201cand are determined to make a real effort to give their marriage another chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith ups and downs over the next few years, but they always manage to work things out. They both decide that love, like most everything else in life, is a decision and they\u2019ve decided to stay together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the winery?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>\u201cGreg does replant with the vines Matthias sells him, and in a few years Bennett Wines will once again be known as some of the area\u2019s best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatthias and his grandson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boy makes a full recovery and Matthias takes frequent trips to California. When the grapes mature, Greg gives Matthias a percentage of the profits as a means of thanking him for his forgiveness and for his help through the early years. That small percentage is enough for Matthias to retire completely. And Gloria meets a good man, a new assistant winemaker hired by Greg. They eventually get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Mercy said. \u201cFor all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Greg and Edward?\u201d Goodness asked. \u201cDoes he ever find out that Greg\u2019s his biological father?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shook his head. \u201cEdward doesn\u2019t change his mind about not wanting to know him, and Greg respects his decision. However, he is deeply grateful for the opportunity to have met the son he fathered.\u201d</p><p>Mercy smiled sadly as the carolers began singing \u201cWhat Child Is This?\u201d Shirley nodded in understanding.</p><p>\u201cNow, are you three ready to return to heaven?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>Goodness and Mercy agreed, but with obvious reluctance.</p><p>\u201cCan we come back next year?\u201d Goodness asked as they drifted upward.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see,\u201d Gabriel told her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Shirley linked hands with her two friends. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see who needs our help most,\u201d she whispered to Goodness and Mercy. </p>  </body></html>"]
