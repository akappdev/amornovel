If you can knit, purl, knit two together and put the yarn over your needle to form a new stitch, you CAN knit lace.\u201d</p><p>Myrna A.I. Stahman, Rocking Chair Press, designer, author and publisher of Stahman\u2019s Shawls and Scarves\u2014Lace Faroese-Shaped Shawls From The Neck Down and Seamen\u2019s Scarves, and the soon to be published The Versatility of Lace Knitting\u2014Variations on a Theme</p><p>Lydia Goetz</p> <p>I love A Good Yarn, and I\u2019m grateful for every minute I spend in my shop on Blossom Street. I love looking at the skeins of yarn in all their colors and feeling the different textures. I love my knitting classes and the friends I\u2019ve made here. I love studying the pattern books. I love gazing out my front window onto the energy and activity of downtown Seattle. In fact, I love everything about this life I\u2019ve found, this world I\u2019ve built.</p><p>Knitting was my salvation. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve said often, I know, but it\u2019s simply the truth. Even now, after nearly ten years of living cancer-free, knitting dominates my life. Because of my yarn store, I\u2019ve become part of a community of knitters and friends.</p><p>I\u2019m also married now, to Brad Goetz. A Good Yarn was my first real chance at life and Brad was my first chance at love. Together, Brad and I are raising our nine-year-old son. I say Cody\u2019s our son, and he is, in all the ways that matter. I consider him as much my child as Brad\u2019s; I couldn\u2019t love Cody more if I\u2019d given birth to him. It\u2019s true he has a mother, and I know Janice does care about him. But Brad\u2019s ex-wife is...well, I hesitate to say it, but selfish is the word that inevitably comes to mind. Janice appears intermittently in Cody\u2019s life, whenever the mood strikes her or she happens to find it convenient\u2014despite the parenting plan she signed when she and Brad divorced. Sadly, she only sees her son once or twice a year. I can tell that the lack of communication bothers Cody. And Janice\u2019s cavalier attitude toward motherhood angers me, but like my son, I don\u2019t mention the hurt. Cody doesn\u2019t need me to defend or malign Janice; he\u2019s capable of forming his own opinions. For a kid, he\u2019s remarkably resilient and insightful.</p><p>On a February morning, my store with all its warmth and color was a cozy place to be. The timer on the microwave went off; I removed the boiling water and poured it into my teapot after dropping in a couple of tea bags. The rain was falling from brooding, gray skies as it often does in winter. I decided it was time to start another knitting class. I maintain several ongoing classes and charity knitting groups, and I usually begin a new session four or five times a year.</p><p>As I considered my new class, I was also thinking about my mother, who\u2019s adjusted to life in the assisted-living complex reasonably well. In some ways, I suspect that moving her was even more difficult for my sister, Margaret, and me than it was for Mom. Although Mom hated giving up her independence, she seemed relieved not to have the worry about the house and yard anymore. I wept the day the house was sold, and while she never allowed me to see her tears, I believe Margaret did, too. Selling the house meant letting go of our childhood and all the reminders of growing up there. It was the end of an era for us both, just as it was for our mother.</p> <p>While I drank my tea, I flipped through the new patterns that had arrived the day before. The first one to catch my eye was a prayer shawl. Lately, I\u2019d seen several patterns for these shawls, some more complex than others. I could easily envision knitting this one for Mom.</p><p>Prayer shawls have become popular in the last few years\u2014and not only for prayer. They offer comfort and warmth, emotional, as well as physical. I\u2019d received several inquiries about them and thought perhaps one of these shawls would make for an interesting class. I decided to discuss it with my sister, Margaret, who has a keen business sense and a good feel for which class I should offer next. I didn\u2019t appreciate that about her until after she\u2019d come to join me at the shop. Margaret worked for me part-time, which has now turned into full-time. She\u2019s not as good with people as I am, but she knows yarn and, surprisingly, has become an excellent employee. She\u2019s also my friend. Not so long ago, I couldn\u2019t have said that; we might be sisters, but the tension between us was unbearable at times. Our relationship changed for the better, and I thank A Good Yarn for that.</p><p>Margaret wouldn\u2019t arrive for another thirty minutes, since the shop officially opened at ten. Any number of tasks awaited my attention, things I should be doing, like paying bills and ordering new yarn. Instead, I sat at my desk, with my teacup between my hands. I felt so incredibly blessed.</p><p>Needless to say, I didn\u2019t always feel this tranquil. When I was in my early twenties, a second bout of cancer struck with a viciousness that had me reeling. I survived, but my father didn\u2019t. You see, he fought so hard for me, and when it seemed I\u2019d make it after all, he died, suddenly and unexpectedly, of a heart attack. It was almost as though my recovery meant he could leave me now.</p><p>Before I lost Dad, I tended to approach my life tentatively, afraid of happiness, fearing the future. It was a void that loomed hopelessly before me and filled me with dread. Dad was the one who gave me strength. With him gone, I knew I was responsible for my own life. I had a decision to make and I boldly chose...independence. I chose to become part of the world I\u2019d retreated from years before.</p><p>The ceiling above me creaked and I knew Colette was up. Colette Blake rented the small apartment over the shop. For the first two years, that tiny apartment was my home, my very first home away from family.</p> <p>After I married Brad, I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do with the apartment. It stood empty for a while. Then I met Colette, and I\u2019d known instantly that she\u2019d be the perfect tenant. The apartment would console her, give her a place to regain her emotional balance. A bonus\u2014for me\u2014is that she looks after Whiskers on my days off. My cat is a much-loved feature in my store, which he considers his home. I\u2019ve had customers stop by just to visit him. He often sleeps in the front window, curling up in the afternoon sun. Whiskers generates lots of comments\u2014and smiles. Pets have a way of connecting people to life\u2019s uncomplicated joys.</p><p>Colette reminds me of myself three years ago, when I first opened the store. I met her shortly before Christmas, when Susannah Nelson, who owns the flower shop next door, brought her over to meet me. It wasn\u2019t cancer that shook her world, though. It was death. Colette is a thirty-one-year-old widow. Her husband, Derek, a Seattle policeman, died a little over a year ago. When I mention that, people usually assume Derek was killed in the line of duty. Not so. Following a Seattle downpour, he climbed on the roof to repair a leak. No one knows exactly how it happened but apparently Derek slipped and fell. He died two days later of massive head injuries.</p><p>In the weeks since she\u2019d moved here, Colette had only referred to the accident once, as if even talking about her husband was difficult. I\u2019ve learned that she\u2019s an easygoing person who laughs readily and yet at times her grief seemed palpable. Overwhelming. I understood how she felt. I remembered all too well that sense of anguish, that terror of what might happen tomorrow or the next day. Colette approached life fearfully, just the way I once did. I longed to reassure her, and I hoped my friendship provided some pleasure and solace. Friends like Jacqueline and Alix had done the same for me.</p><p>The apartment has an outside entrance, as well as the one leading into the store. Susannah Nelson had hired Colette soon after Susannah purchased what used to be known as Fanny\u2019s Floral. Colette\u2019s mother once owned a flower shop, and Colette had worked there as a high-school student. Her house sold practically the day it was listed, and Colette needed to move quickly. My tiny apartment was vacant, so we struck a deal. I assumed she wouldn\u2019t be there long. Most of her belongings were in storage and she was taking the next few months to decide where she\u2019d live and what she\u2019d do.</p><p>The stairs creaked as she ventured down. Since Colette became my tenant, we sometimes shared a pot of tea in the mornings. She was always respectful of my time and I enjoyed our leisurely chats.</p><p>\u201cTea\u2019s ready.\u201d I reached for a clean cup. Without asking, I filled it and held it out.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Colette smiled as she took the tea.</p><p>She was thin\u2014too thin, really. Her clothes were a bit loose, but with her aptitude for style she cleverly disguised it. I noticed, though, as someone who\u2019s done the same thing. Part of what I liked about her was the fact that she was lovely without seeming consciously aware of it. Despite her occasional silences, Colette was warm and personable, and I could see she\u2019d be a success at whatever she chose. She hadn\u2019t said much about the job she\u2019d left, but I gathered it was a far more demanding position than helping customers in a flower shop.</p> <p>This job change obviously had something to do with her husband\u2019s death. She told me he\u2019d died a year ago January fourteenth. She\u2019d waited for the year to pass before making major changes in her life\u2014selling her home, moving, quitting her job. These changes seem drastic in some ways and completely understandable in others.</p><p>Colette wore her long, dark hair parted in the middle. It fell straight to her shoulders, where it curved under. She seemed to achieve this effect naturally\u2014unlike some women, who spend hours taming their hair with gel and spray.</p><p>In the short time she\u2019d been here, Colette had made a positive impression on everyone she met. Everyone except my sister. Margaret, being Margaret, shied away from Colette, instinctively distrusting her. My sister\u2019s like that; she tends to be a naysayer. She insisted that renting out the apartment had been a huge mistake. In Margaret\u2019s eyes, a tenant, any tenant, wasn\u2019t to be trusted. She appeared to think Colette would sneak into the shop in the middle of the night and steal every skein of yarn I owned, then hock them on the streets and use the money for drugs. I smiled whenever I thought about that, since not only did I trust Colette, I have a fairly expensive alarm system.</p><p>Margaret is, to put it mildly, protective of me. She\u2019s older and tends to assume more responsibility than is warranted. It\u2019s taken me a long time to understand my sister and even longer to appreciate her, but that\u2019s a different story.</p><p>Colette held the teacup close to her mouth and paused. \u201cDerek would\u2019ve turned thirty-three today,\u201d she said quietly. She stared into the distance, then looked back at me.</p><p>I nodded, encouraging her to talk. She\u2019d only told me about Derek that one other time. I believed, based on my own experience, that the more she shared her pain, the less it would hurt. \u201cDerek wanted children.... We\u2019d been trying, but I didn\u2019t get pregnant and now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have children one day,\u201d I told her. I was confident that she wouldn\u2019t be alone for the rest of her life, that she\u2019d marry again and probably have children.</p><p>Her smiled was filled with sadness. \u201cDerek and I talked about a baby that morning. The next thing I knew, I was choosing his casket. Ironic, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to comfort her, so I leaned over and gave her a hug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She seemed a little embarrassed by my show of sympathy and focused her gaze on the floor. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything. I didn\u2019t mean to start your day on a sad note. Actually, it wasn\u2019t until I glanced at the calendar on your desk that I realized the date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Colette. I\u2019m just so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, shrugging lightly. \u201cLife is like that sometimes, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d And I did.</p> <p>Colette set the empty cup in my sink.</p><p>The back door opened, then shut with a bang. Margaret, of course, muttering about the weather. After Colette moved in, Margaret had taken to parking in the alley, apparently to keep an eye on my tenant\u2019s comings and goings. After dumping her huge felted purse on the table, she hesitated, stiffening at the sight of Colette.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said brightly, pleased to see her despite her bad mood. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine morning, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I couldn\u2019t resist a touch of sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s raining,\u201d she replied, eyeing Colette almost as if she were an intruder.</p><p>\u201cRainy weather\u2019s good for knitting,\u201d I reminded her. For me, there was nothing more satisfying on a rainy afternoon than working on my current knitting project with a cup of tea by my side. People looked for something productive to do when it rained and\u2014fortunately for me\u2014that sometimes included knitting.</p> <p>Margaret removed her coat and hung it on the peg by the back door. \u201cJulia dropped me off this morning,\u201d she said in passing.</p><p>I caught the significance right away. \u201cYou let Julia drive the new car?\u201d Only the day before, Margaret had said that her oldest daughter, a high-school senior, had been asking to take the car out for a spin. If I recall, Margaret\u2019s exact words were Not in this lifetime.</p><p>Margaret\u2019s hot-from-the-showroom vehicle was a first for the family, since she and Matt had always purchased their cars secondhand. Margaret\u2019s previous car was well past repairing, and she was excited about buying a brand-new vehicle. They\u2019d looked for weeks before deciding on one that was in high demand and said to get incredibly good mileage. Once the decision was made, they\u2019d waited two months for the vehicle to arrive. Which it finally had in all its metallic-blue glory.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Margaret grumbled. \u201cI said I wasn\u2019t going to let her take the car, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. She has something going on after school and somehow managed to convince me that her entire scholastic future rested on driving my car.\u201d Her mouth twitched as she admitted how easily Julia had finessed her way past her mother\u2019s objections.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even have a hundred miles on that car,\u201d Margaret said. \u201cThat\u2019s how fast she broke down my defenses. Sad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Colette laughed. \u201cKids can do that.\u201d</p> <p>Margaret responded to the comment with a dismissive nod, barely acknowledging Colette.</p><p>Colette\u2019s eyes momentarily met mine. \u201cI\u2019ll catch up with you later, Lydia,\u201d she said and headed back upstairs.</p><p>Margaret\u2019s gaze followed Colette. \u201cYou like her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s great.\u201d I wished my sister would give Colette a chance. Hoping the sympathy factor might work, I added, \u201cToday\u2019s her dead husband\u2019s birthday. She\u2019d started telling me about it when you arrived.\u201d</p><p>Margaret had the grace to look ashamed. \u201cThat\u2019s tough,\u201d she said, her own eyes returning to the stairs. The door had been left open and Whiskers wandered down.</p><p>\u201cI know the rental income\u2019s a plus, but frankly I don\u2019t trust her,\u201d Margaret said.</p><p>I sighed; I\u2019d heard this far too often and it still made no sense to me.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked defensively.</p> <p>\u201cThink about it,\u201d Margaret said. \u201cColette\u2019s obviously far more capable than she\u2019s letting on. Why is she working in a flower shop? She could get a job anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just lost her husband,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cA year ago. Okay, that\u2019s tragic and I\u2019m sorry, but it doesn\u2019t mean she has to go into hiding, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t hiding.\u201d I didn\u2019t know that for sure. But I argued with Margaret because I sincerely liked Colette; my sister was overreacting and it troubled me that she went through life seeing everyone as suspect.</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2019s she working next door for minimum wage?\u201d Margaret pressed. \u201cThere\u2019s more to her than meets the eye and until we find out what it is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to be so chummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone handles grief differently,\u201d I went on to explain, although I didn\u2019t have the answers Margaret wanted. It was true that Colette had made a lot of major changes in a short time. Equally true that I didn\u2019t know much about her circumstances.</p><p>\u201cI doubt any of this has to do with her husband, anyway,\u201d Margaret said, still looking in the direction of the stairs. \u201cMark my words, Colette\u2019s hiding something.\u201d</p><p>My sister sometimes shocked me with the things she said. \u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake, that\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>Margaret raised one shoulder. \u201cMaybe, but I doubt it. Something about her doesn\u2019t sit right with me. I know you like her and apparently Susannah does, too, but I\u2019m reserving judgment until we learn more about her.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head stubbornly. My instincts told me Colette was a good person.</p><p>Margaret frowned at my wordless response. \u201cJust promise me you\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>Careful? She made Colette sound like a fugitive. \u201cYou\u2019ve been reading too many detective novels,\u201d I teased, knowing how much my sister enjoyed reading suspense fiction. She kept a paperback tucked inside her purse and enjoyed discussing the plots with me. I tend to listen to audio books; that way, I can \u201cread\u201d and knit at the same time. That\u2019s my idea of multitasking.</p><p>\u201cHas Colette ever mentioned where she used to work before Susannah\u2019s Garden?\u201d Margaret asked.</p><p>\u201cNo...but why should she?\u201d</p><p>Margaret cast me one of the looks that suggested I was far too trusting.</p><p>Clearly Margaret had a more vivid imagination than I did. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s in the witness protection program, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re implying.\u201d I walked to the front of the shop, rolled up the shade on the door and turned the Closed sign to Open. I saw that the rain had intensified in the last while. Whiskers immediately leaped into the window and curled up, purring softly.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to discuss another knitting class,\u201d I said, remembering my thoughts of earlier that morning. I flipped the light switch and through the steamy windows of the French Caf\u00e9 across the street, I saw my friend Alix Townsend, who worked there as a baker. The rain came down in a torrent, falling so hard it bounced against the pavement and ran in the gutters. It\u2019d been nearly two weeks since Alix and I had talked and I\u2019d missed her. I knew she had less free time these days, since she was in the middle of planning her wedding.</p><p>Many changes had taken place since I\u2019d come to Blossom Street. The French Caf\u00e9, of course, and Susannah\u2019s Garden. There was a new bookstore three doors down from me now, and directly across from that was the old bank building, which had been turned into ultra-expensive condos. They sold so fast, even the real estate people were shocked. A few of the residents had taken my knitting classes and I was beginning to know them.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go and see Alix this morning,\u201d I said casually. I rarely ate breakfast but I was in the mood for something sweet. If I timed it right, maybe Alix would be able to join me for a muffin and a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re changing the subject again,\u201d Margaret said from behind me.</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d I tried to recall what we\u2019d been discussing. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. I was just thinking about everything that\u2019s happened on Blossom Street.\u201d</p><p>Margaret glanced at me. \u201cIt all started with you and A Good Yarn,\u201d my sister said. \u201cYou set the tone for this neighborhood. People like it here.\u201d</p><p>Praise from Margaret was rare indeed and I felt a surge of pleasure at her words.</p><p>Despite the rain and despite our disagreement about Colette, I knew we were going to have a good day.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Alix Townsend</p><p>It was raining\u2014again. Alix Townsend dashed across the street, already drenched by the rain that had been coming down steadily since the Thursday before. She needed a cigarette. Bad. After more than two years without one, she could hardly believe how intense the craving was. She felt blindsided by it. The damn wedding\u2014that was the problem. A whole vocabulary of swearwords raced through her mind. In less than four months, on June second, she would become Reverend Jordan Turner\u2019s wife, and frankly, that terrified her.</p><p>Alix Townsend a pastor\u2019s wife! It was almost laughable. Although few people knew it, her mother was in prison for a variety of crimes, including forgery, passing bad checks and attempted murder. This wasn\u2019t her first stint in jail, either. Tom, Alix\u2019s only brother, was dead of a drug overdose and she hadn\u2019t had any contact with her father since she was twelve. As far as she knew, he\u2019d made no effort to get in touch with her. When it came to family, Alix definitely felt cheated.</p><p>She didn\u2019t consider herself a fancy-church-wedding candidate, but somehow, almost without noticing it, she\u2019d become immersed in this whole crazy mess. This...this sideshow of a wedding.</p><p>\u201cAlix,\u201d Jordan shouted, running after her, his feet pounding hard as he crossed the road and splashed his way through the puddles on Blossom Street.</p><p>Alix had visited Jordan\u2019s office during lunch break. They hadn\u2019t actually argued, although they\u2019d come close. She hated what this wedding had turned into, hated having no control, hated that no one seemed willing to listen. Not even Jordan. When she realized he wasn\u2019t hearing her, she\u2019d rushed out of his office with a huge lump in her throat. The stinging tears surprised her as much as the craving for a cigarette.</p><p>She ignored Jordan\u2019s shout. With the rain and wind, it was easy to pretend she hadn\u2019t heard him.</p><p>\u201cAlix!\u201d he yelled again and a moment later caught up with her.</p><p>She slowed her pace and he fell into step beside her. \u201cWhat just happened back there?\u201d he asked. He was obviously confused by the way she\u2019d hightailed it out of his office.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked, annoyed that he couldn\u2019t figure it out.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you leave like that? We were right in the middle of a conversation and all of a sudden, you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t listening to me,\u201d she said, looking up at him, not caring that the rain had drenched her short hair, which dripped down her face and onto her chin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so upset,\u201d he began. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d she cried, struggling not to get emotional. \u201cShouldn\u2019t I have some say in my own wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do.\u201d He still seemed befuddled. \u201cThe last thing I remember was you telling me Jacqueline and Reese had decided to hold the reception at their country club.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s very generous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, but...\u201d Jacqueline and Reese had been wonderful\u2014about everything. Alix owed them far more than she could ever repay.</p><p>She\u2019d met Jacqueline in a knitting class at A Good Yarn, and after a rough start the older woman had taken Alix under her wing. Alix had signed up for that class in order to work off community service hours on a trumped-up drug charge; she\u2019d decided to knit a baby blanket and donate it to charity. Her caseworker had approved the project and that was the beginning of her friendship with the Donovans.</p> <p>Through Reese Donovan\u2019s business connections and the Rotary Club, Alix had been able to attend culinary school. The Donovans had provided part-time employment, as well. She\u2019d filled in as their housekeeper when needed, and they\u2019d let her move into their guesthouse, where she still lived. Jacqueline and Reese were about as close to family as Alix ever hoped to have. They\u2019d given her the love, encouragement and support her own parents never had, and Alix loved them in return. She\u2019d asked their daughter-in-law, Tammie Lee, to serve as her matron of honor. Jordan\u2019s brother, Bret, was to be his best man.</p><p>\u201cFrom what my mother told me, Jacqueline had to call in all kinds of favors to get the country club for a Saturday in June,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The guilt was even stronger than her craving for a cigarette. \u201cBut, Jordan\u2014the country club?\u201d</p><p>Her fianc\u00e9 placed his arm around her shoulders. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of the rain.\u201d He led her under the awning outside the French Caf\u00e9. The rain beat against it and the water fell in a solid sheet over the edge.</p><p>\u201cMom was really pleased when I told her what Jacqueline had done,\u201d Jordan continued.</p> <p>Alix lowered her head. Jordan\u2019s mother was a subject best avoided. Susan Turner would\u2019ve preferred a more traditional bride for her son. Her future mother-in-law hadn\u2019t said or done anything overt, but Alix wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew. Jordan was close to his parents, though, and Alix would never mention any of this to him.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s eyes flared wide. \u201cHere? Now?\u201d He glanced over his shoulder through the large picture window at the caf\u00e9 filled with customers.</p><p>Alix nodded, not caring who saw them or what anyone thought. \u201cAnd not a peck on the cheek, either. I need a real kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He clasped her shoulders with both hands and bent down to cover her mouth with his. His lips were warm and moist as they touched hers, his mouth slightly open. Relaxing, she savored his taste, his feel. She did her best to remember that while a big fancy wedding wasn\u2019t what she wanted, it would make a lot of people happy\u2014people like Jordan and his family and Jacqueline and Reese. She\u2019d do it; she didn\u2019t have to like it. With that in mind, she slid her arms around Jordan\u2019s neck and leaned into him. She wanted him to know how much she loved him. She must love him if she was willing to go through with this craziness.</p><p>When he broke off the kiss, she sighed and instantly felt better.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to talk to me, Alix,\u201d he whispered, holding her tight, nuzzling her neck. \u201cTell me when you\u2019re worried about something....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. You weren\u2019t listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cDo you want to call off the wedding? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Her response came fast and vehemently. \u201cI love you. I want us to be married.\u201d</p><p>He brushed the wet hair from her forehead, his eyes intense. \u201cAnd I love you.\u201d</p><p>She looked away because the love shining from his eyes confused her and made it difficult to speak. \u201cAs soon as you gave me the engagement ring, I should\u2019ve known everything would change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBefore...before, it was just you and me\u2014and your teens, of course.\u201d As a youth pastor, Jordan planned church-related activities with the teenagers in his congregation. Alix often tagged along to help. It was understood that once they were married, her role would continue in a larger capacity. That was fine; she enjoyed working with that age-group. She related to a lot of the temptations they faced in the world and found it gratifying that she was able to steer some of them away from making negative choices, choices she\u2019d made as a teenager and come to regret.</p> <p>Then the minute he\u2019d slipped the engagement ring on her finger, life as she knew it changed.</p><p>As soon as she heard the news, Jacqueline had instantly started talking about the wedding. In fact, for Christmas, Jacqueline had presented Alix with a huge hardcover book titled Planning the Perfect Wedding. At the time, Alix hadn\u2019t given the actual ceremony much thought. She figured she\u2019d marry Jordan with his family and a few friends in attendance, open gifts, eat cake, and that would be it.</p><p>Boy, was she wrong. The wedding was turning into a production, like a Broadway musical or something, with a dinner that cost more per plate than she\u2019d earned in a week back when she\u2019d been employed at the video store.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t all. The dress\u2014correction, gown\u2014had become a major issue. Each one she\u2019d seen came covered with expensive lace or hundreds of tiny pearls. Or both. Jacqueline had taken her to a boutique, and Alix had made the mistake of glancing at the price tag. She\u2019d nearly fainted. People bought cars for less money than those dresses!</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we elope?\u201d she pleaded, her face buried in Jordan\u2019s chest. She knew the answer; still, she had to ask.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She looked up, hoping he\u2019d give her the confidence she needed to see this through. The acceptance\u2014the resignation\u2014she\u2019d felt earlier had faded. She was no longer sure she could be Alix Townsend, Perfect Bride. The wedding was four months away and already she could feel the panic rising inside her.</p><p>More than anything she wanted to be Jordan\u2019s wife. She\u2019d fallen in love with him when they were in the sixth grade; he embodied everything she\u2019d ever longed for in life. Then she\u2019d met him again three years ago, shortly after she\u2019d joined the knitting class. She remembered every single fact about Jordan from grade school. She remembered what she\u2019d learned about his family, too. His mom and dad loved each other and cared for their children. They weren\u2019t drunks and losers like her parents. They had regular meals, during which the entire family sat down at the table and talked about their day. In Alix\u2019s home, no one did anything together. If her mother was inclined to cook, dinner was left on the stove and everyone dished up their own meals. Most nights Alix ate alone in front of the television while her parents argued in the background. More often than she cared to count, the fights turned physical and she hid in the closet, where she\u2019d invented a fantasy world\u2014a whole family of parents and siblings like the ones on TV. Or the ones at Jordan\u2019s house...</p><p>The contrast between her life and his didn\u2019t stop there. Alix\u2019s mother had once fired a gun at her father and landed in jail. By the time she left school, Alix had gone through a whole series of foster homes. During those years she\u2019d been in plenty of trouble, too. But when Tom died of a drug overdose, it had hit her hard. Alix knew she was headed for the same fate if she didn\u2019t change her life. From that moment, she swore off drugs. They were death with a capital D. She\u2019d been tempted more than once, but had always found the courage to walk away.</p><p>\u201cThe wedding\u2019s just one day out of our lives,\u201d Jordan pointed out.</p><p>Alix sighed. Twenty-four hours\u2014actually, less than that\u2014she could handle. The wedding was scheduled for five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, followed by a dinner and reception at the country club. Jordan already had reservations at a hotel in Victoria, British Columbia, for their honeymoon. If enduring a formal wedding meant she\u2019d be Jordan\u2019s wife at the end of that day, then she\u2019d do it without another word of complaint.</p><p>\u201cI know this isn\u2019t your kind of thing,\u201d Jordan said, kissing the top of her wet head. \u201cThe truth is, all I care about is being married to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t we just get married by ourselves and tell everyone after the fact?\u201d Even as she said it, Alix knew that would never happen.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t, sweetheart, I\u2019m sorry. My mother would feel we\u2019d cheated her and...there\u2019d be talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk,\u201d she repeated, her voice numb.</p><p>\u201cI work in a church,\u201d he reminded her unnecessarily. \u201cEloping isn\u2019t a good example to pass along to the kids in the congregation. You might not realize it, but they watch everything we say and do.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t news to Alix, since she was well aware of how the teens looked up to Jordan and consequently, to her. She remembered the first time she\u2019d seen Jordan with a group of church kids at a local skating rink. He\u2019d made her think of the Pied Piper leading children through the town. Those kids thought the world of him; they idolized him and had sent frequent glances her way, apparently shocked that he was associated with her. They weren\u2019t the only ones.</p><p>It\u2019d taken Alix a long time to believe that Jordan loved her. Even now, she wasn\u2019t sure what had attracted him to her. Whatever it was, she felt deeply grateful.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a small wedding,\u201d Jordan promised.</p><p>She nodded. Her guest list was limited to a few friends, most of whom she\u2019d met through the knitting class. Maybe twenty people.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s putting together her list this week.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of his mother, Alix tensed. She liked Jordan\u2019s mother but couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she was a disappointment to Susan Turner. In truth, Alix didn\u2019t blame her and was determined to do whatever she could to make this relationship a successful one.</p><p>She derived some comfort from knowing that Jacqueline hadn\u2019t liked her daughter-in-law in the beginning, either. Jacqueline couldn\u2019t understand why Paul, their only son, would marry someone like Tammie Lee, whose southern background was so dissimilar to his own.</p><p>If Alix recalled correctly, Jacqueline had had another woman in mind for Paul. Tammie Lee had persevered, though, and eventually her kindness and charm had won Jacqueline over. By the time her first grandchild was born, Jacqueline had wholeheartedly accepted Tammie Lee. Now they were as close as...well, family. And Alix considered Tammie Lee one of her best friends.</p><p>Susan Turner might well have another woman in mind for her youngest son, too. If so, Jordan had never mentioned anyone. One Sunday, three years ago, Alix had slipped into the back of the church without Jordan\u2019s knowledge. As part of the service he\u2019d sung a duet with a beautiful blonde\u2014who\u2019d turned out to be his cousin. But seeing him with someone else, even in church, had infuriated Alix. Jordan had been equally upset with her for jumping to conclusions. He was right. Not once in all the time they\u2019d dated had Jordan given her reason to suspect he was interested in anyone else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That didn\u2019t mean his mother shared his certainty about Alix, though. Still, Susan had always been polite, if a bit cool. Jordan got along exceptionally well with his parents, and the last thing Alix wanted to do was mess that up for him.</p><p>\u201cYou need something to take your mind off all this wedding business,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d She was eager to do anything that would help her get through the next few months.</p><p>\u201cWhat about another knitting class?\u201d</p> <p>Alix bit her lip as she considered the idea. She nodded slowly. \u201cLydia was in the other day and we chatted for a few minutes. She\u2019s always got classes going and she\u2019s starting a new one for a prayer shawl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would I give it to, though?\u201d Alix asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about my grandmother Turner?\u201d</p><p>Alix knew immediately that this was the perfect suggestion. She\u2019d met his grandmother for the first time over the Christmas holidays, shortly after Jordan had given her the engagement ring, and had felt an instant connection with the old woman. They\u2019d talked for hours, finding that their views were surprisingly alike and laughing at the same corny jokes. Although well into her eighties, Grandma lived on her own and still managed to keep a large flower garden. Alix had called Grandma Turner several times since and been out to see her last month with Jordan.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll sign up for the class after work,\u201d Alix told him.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He sighed, as though relieved the matter was settled.</p><p>Alix leaned into Jordan and kissed him again. She wanted him to know how much she appreciated the fact that he\u2019d come after her. She\u2019d left before he\u2019d begun to really listen to her. Before he\u2019d taken her doubts and fears about this wedding seriously. But he was listening now.</p><p>She must have put a bit more emotion into the kiss than she\u2019d realized because Jordan was breathing hard when they broke apart. He cleared his throat. \u201cThat was nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she agreed in a soft voice. \u201cIt was.\u201d</p><p>Jordan pulled her back into his arms. \u201cJune can\u2019t get here too soon as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI second that,\u201d Alix said with a laugh.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>Colette Blake</p><p>Colette suspected that Margaret from the yarn store had never meant for her to hear that comment. The truth was, she was running away; she was hiding...from Christian Dempsey, from her past and\u2014mostly\u2014from herself. Colette had been halfway up the stairs when Margaret\u2019s words hit her square in the back and now, a week later, those words continued to sting. She felt an overwhelming urge to explain, but she resisted. How could she tell these two women she\u2019d been a widow for a year but was two months pregnant? Life was full of ironies, to say the least. Bitter ironies...</p><p>For three years she and Derek had tried to have a baby with no success. Then...one slip. A one-night stand, and here she was, carrying the child of a man she\u2019d hoped never to see again. The very thought of Christian Dempsey filled her with dread. How could she have worked as his personal assistant for five years and been so naively unaware of the kind of man he was? Losing Derek, her shocking discovery about Christian and now this unexpected pregnancy\u2014it was enough to drive anyone to the brink of emotional collapse.</p><p>Memories of her dead husband always brought her a pang of loss. It shouldn\u2019t hurt this much after a full year and yet it did. His death made no sense to her. Her guilt over the fight they\u2019d had just before his accident, another fight about their fertility problems, didn\u2019t help. Nevertheless, her husband was dead, and she had to deal with that reality. She hated it. She hated every minute of life without Derek.</p><p>It was so stupid that he\u2019d died. So incredibly stupid. For the first few weeks, her anger at the unfairness of it had consumed her. Derek should never have gotten up on that roof in the first place. All it would\u2019ve taken was a simple phone call, and a professional repairman could\u2019ve come out to take care of the leak. Derek had no business even attempting it. However, he\u2019d said that any delay would cause more damage and claimed the job was a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d Before she could stop him, he had the ladder up against the side of the house and a tool belt slung around his waist. This was his opportunity to use the tools he\u2019d gotten for Christmas; she wondered if that was his real motivation, or part of it, anyway. So pointless. So foolish.</p><p>If there was one thing to be grateful for, it was the fact that Colette hadn\u2019t witnessed his fall. A neighbor friend had been there, talking to Derek, when he lost his balance and slid off the roof onto the concrete driveway. The neighbor called 911 from his cell phone before Colette even knew anything was wrong. Derek had been rushed to the hospital and never regained consciousness.</p> <p>Initially Colette had been in shock, and then, as soon as the fog cleared and her numbness dissipated, she became angry. Deeply, furiously angry. The anger was followed by a feeling of sadness and overpowering loss. But none of this was a good reason for what she\u2019d done a couple of months ago.</p><p>Her cheeks grew hot with embarrassment as she sat at the round oak table in her tiny kitchen. Covering her face with both hands, she relived the night of the company Christmas party.</p><p>Colette had been Christian Dempsey\u2019s personal assistant for five years. That had come about in a completely unexpected way.</p><p>After working at Dempsey Imports in customs clearance, she\u2019d been transferred to another floor near the corporate offices. Recently married, she was excited about her promotion to broker and the raise that went with it. She and Derek were just setting up house and with the added expenses of the honeymoon and the wedding, which they\u2019d paid for themselves, the increase in pay had been a blessing.</p><p>Although she\u2019d been with the company for two years, Colette had only seen Mr. Dempsey briefly and in passing. He was a man who exuded authority and power. He was frequently away from the office on foreign buying trips, and whenever he made an appearance, he seemed remote and preoccupied. This had probably contributed to the mystique that surrounded him. It didn\u2019t hurt that he was six-three, solidly built and exceptionally good-looking. Heads turned anytime he walked into a room; he commanded that kind of respect and attention. Her first day on the second floor, Mr. Dempsey had arrived at work soon after she did and Colette, standing in the corridor between his office and her own department, had greeted him.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Dempsey.\u201d</p><p>Those four words would forever change the course of her career\u2014and her life.</p><p>He walked past her, with only the slightest acknowledgement of her greeting. It was then that she noticed everyone in the room watching her.</p><p>She waited until Christian Dempsey was inside his office, then gazed around her. People simply stared. Jenny, her boss, had a coffee mug half raised to her lips, her expression one of disbelief. Mark Taylor stood in front of a filing cabinet, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s everyone looking at me like that?\u201d Colette asked.</p><p>Jenny set the coffee down on her desk and answered in a hushed whisper, \u201cNo one talks to Mr. Dempsey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Mark reiterated.</p><p>Colette couldn\u2019t imagine why not. He was flesh and blood like everyone else. Wishing him a good day was just the polite thing to do. But when she asked about it, she didn\u2019t get a satisfactory response. Jenny sputtered, \u201cBecause he\u2019s...because.\u201d And Mark said, \u201cWell, he\u2019s very busy, you know.\u201d None of which, in Colette\u2019s view, justified the staff\u2019s awed\u2014or was it fearful?\u2014reaction.</p><p>An hour later, she was summoned to Mr. Dempsey\u2019s office by his assistant, who came to ask if she was the person who\u2019d greeted him that morning. Her fellow workers cast her sympathetic looks as Colette rose from her desk and followed Dempsey\u2019s assistant into the inner sanctum. Glancing over her shoulder, she noticed that Jenny was biting her lip. Mark waved as if to bid her farewell. Karen Christie and the others shrugged mournfully. Colette hadn\u2019t known what to expect...except the worst.</p><p>Christian was working on his computer when she was ushered into his office. His assistant announced her name and left her standing there. Mr. Dempsey didn\u2019t look up. Consequently, Colette felt like some minion called in, awaiting his notice. Her mouth had gone dry and she resisted blurting out that she loved her job and didn\u2019t want to lose it. In nervous agitation she clenched her fists at her sides. When he finally deigned to glance in her direction, his eyes held hers.</p><p>\u201cAre you the one who spoke to me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d She probably should\u2019ve apologized but she couldn\u2019t make herself do it. The thought of losing her job because she\u2019d been polite to her employer was ridiculous. And yet...She and Derek had made an offer on a house and needed her income to qualify for the loan. Everything would fall apart if she was fired.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did I wish you a good morning?\u201d she repeated, wanting to be sure she understood the question.</p><p>He gave her a half nod.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she murmured, \u201cI was just being courteous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you new to the company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked here for two years.\u201d Her throat felt scratchy but she refused to let him see how nervous she was by clearing it. Dempsey\u2019s was currently the largest Seattle import company and one of the biggest on the West Coast.</p><p>He frowned as if he didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you before.\u201d</p><p>Colette squared her shoulders. \u201cI received a promotion from customs clearance on the fifth floor to working as a customs broker.\u201d</p><p>He studied her in silence, and when he spoke, she found his question surprising. \u201cIs that a wedding band on your finger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was married a few months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She didn\u2019t know how to respond. Anything she said might be considered crossing the line between professional respect and what could be perceived as excessive familiarity.</p><p>\u201cPeter is leaving my employment and I\u2019m looking for a personal assistant. You\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Colette slapped her hand over her heart in astonishment. \u201cWhat about HR? Shouldn\u2019t they be sending you people to interview?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want the job or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...sure. Only...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to hire my own assistants. Now, are you interested?\u201d</p><p>At that point, she should have asked any number of questions; instead, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. Peter will train you. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re earning per hour, but from this point forward you\u2019ll be salaried.\u201d He named a figure that was three times more than her current rate. Colette nearly fainted.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she managed to mumble. Before leaving, she almost curtsied, such was Christian\u2019s effect on her.</p><p>That had been the beginning. For the next five years, she made Christian Dempsey\u2019s travel arrangements, screened his calls, wrote his letters, did research of various kinds, checked contracts and hired translators. She also booked his tee times at the local country club, made reservations for his dinner dates and set up all his appointments. When it came to the business, she was aware of every detail. Or so she\u2019d assumed. She even purchased corporate Christmas gifts on his behalf. The one thing she knew next to nothing about was his family. His mother was dead, although how she\u2019d learned that she couldn\u2019t remember. Probably gossip she\u2019d heard from Jenny or Mark. But in all that time Christian had never said a word about his father or any siblings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For the past five years, Colette had spent nearly every work day looking after the details of his business life\u2014and his private life. She dealt with the women, too, and there was no lack in that department. This was hardly surprising, since Christian was rich, powerful and dynamic, not to mention attractive. Equally unsurprising, these relationships never lasted long.</p><p>She and Derek were grateful for the money she earned, which they spent on things for the house and traveling. They\u2019d taken trips to Australia and New Zealand, Europe and China, purchased new cars and dined out often. Colette enjoyed the benefits of her job. Then they\u2019d decided to start their family and that was when her marital troubles began. She couldn\u2019t get pregnant. There seemed to be no obvious reason, but Derek refused to seek medical help. In his opinion, if a pregnancy happened, it happened and if not, that was fine by him, too. It wasn\u2019t fine with Colette; she wanted children, and her inability to conceive had devastated her.</p><p>After her husband\u2019s death, Christian had been exceptionally kind. The biggest and most elaborate floral arrangement at the funeral had been from Dempsey Imports. He gave her a month off with pay, of which she\u2019d taken two weeks. After that, it was either go back to work or go crazy. As much as possible, her work life returned to normal\u2014until the company Christmas party.</p><p>Colette had handled all the arrangements for the party, which was held at a posh downtown hotel and took place on the third Friday of December. Dinner was followed by entertainment and dancing. It was her first Christmas without Derek, so her parents had wanted her to join them in Colorado. Colette\u2019s flight was leaving late Saturday afternoon.</p> <p>To blame alcohol for what happened would\u2019ve been too easy. Yes, she\u2019d had too much to drink. She\u2019d always been fond of champagne and there\u2019d been plenty of it available. Christian had been drinking, too. Perhaps more than a few glasses; she hadn\u2019t kept count. They were both a long way from being clearheaded and sober, that was for sure.</p><p>At the end of the party, in the wee hours of the morning, she and Christian were the only people left. He\u2019d thanked her for her part in making the evening a success. She\u2019d already received her Christmas bonus but he surprised her by presenting her with a gift\u2014a cameo on a delicate gold chain. Colette hadn\u2019t known what to say. She couldn\u2019t imagine Christian actually taking the time to shop for her. She was the one who always purchased gifts on his behalf. The gesture had touched her deeply. With this gift, Christian was telling her how sorry he was that she\u2019d lost her husband. He was letting her know he appreciated everything she\u2019d done for him and for the company.</p><p>Her eyes had clouded with tears. He tried to dismiss her gratitude but she wouldn\u2019t allow him to do that. Impetuously she stood on the tips of her toes and kissed his cheek. Christian clasped her shoulders and stared down at her, his brow furrowed. Then slowly, as though he was waiting for her to stop him, he lowered his mouth to hers. The kiss was explosive, not at all the gentle expression of thanks she might have expected. Colette was knocked off balance, physically and emotionally.</p><p>When the kiss ended, they were both breathing hard. He looked at her as if he\u2019d never seen her before. He murmured something she couldn\u2019t quite hear; a moment later, she realized he\u2019d told her he was getting a room. No one needed to spell out his intentions, or her own. She wanted him to make love to her. Her head was spinning and even as he led her to the elevator and then to the suite, she knew this was a mistake. Yet she couldn\u2019t make herself walk away. She\u2019d been lonely for so long.</p><p>When Christian unlocked the door and they entered the room, she made one feeble effort to introduce a note of reason.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure we should be doing this?\u201d she\u2019d asked, barely recognizing her own voice.</p><p>Christian had responded with a soft laugh. Then they were kissing again, his mouth warm as his tongue found hers. The passion in him left her trembling. They broke apart only long enough to breathe. In a brief moment of sanity, she tried to talk but all that escaped were incoherent sounds that seemed to encourage him.</p><p>He led her to the bed, stripping off her clothes as they made their way across the suite. They literally fell onto the bed. The ache in her was so powerful, so strong, that she couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t speak. A sob rose in her throat but his deep, open-mouthed kisses swallowed any sound. Then he was making love to her....</p><p>He was an accomplished lover, she\u2019d grant him that. Her body hummed with pleasure, her senses completely alive. Christian knew how to satisfy a woman. Despite knowing what she did about his history with women, she was a willing participant in their lovemaking.</p><p>He turned her face toward his so she couldn\u2019t avoid his gaze. His eyes burned into hers and he brought his mouth to Colette\u2019s, kissing her again and again. She didn\u2019t want to respond and yet she found it impossible not to.</p><p>Afterward, he drew the covers over both of them, and they fell asleep. He drifted off first. Colette was harassed by doubts and regrets but she chased them away, refusing to listen. At least, not then...They would return later, the next day and the next. Even now, months afterward, she could hear them echoing in her mind, asking how she could have dishonored Derek\u2019s memory that way. How she could have acted so irresponsibly. How she could\u2019ve let such a thing happen...</p> <p>At some point during that night she awoke, disoriented. She raised her head from the pillow; the room was still dark. As soon as she realized where she was and who she was with, she opened her eyes wide and her entire body tensed. She tried to slip silently away but the second she moved, Christian rolled over to face her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She blinked uncertainly but he didn\u2019t give her a chance to respond.</p><p>Instead, he leaned closer and gently pressed his lips to hers. Colette wanted to tell him they\u2019d made a terrible mistake. She tried, she sincerely tried, but it was useless. He distracted her with his hands, his mouth, and she forgot her protests. Their lovemaking was passionate and uninhibited. And it didn\u2019t end there. Twice more they made love.</p><p>The next afternoon, when they finally left the hotel room, Colette barely had time to race home, shower, grab her suitcase and fly into Denver to meet her parents.</p><p>It was the worst Christmas of her life. On Christmas Eve she and her parents watched their church\u2019s reenactment of the Nativity, complete with live animals and a newborn baby. The service had her sobbing uncontrollably. Her parents assumed her tears were related to Derek\u2019s death and how dreadfully she missed him, and they were. But it was more than that. She wept for reasons she had yet to fully understand.</p><p>Another worry nagged at her. In their rush and foolishness, neither one had bothered with birth control. Colette had never done much praying until then. A quick glance at the calendar told her that a pregnancy could result from her night with Christian.</p><p>When she returned to work, it was embarrassing for both of them. Christian treated her as if nothing had happened and for a while she pretended, too. Then one day while he was out of the office, she received an important call from one of the customs brokers and needed to get onto his computer to find a contract service code. His system was shut down, although he\u2019d never turned it off before; she\u2019d frequently needed to refer to files in the past and he always left his computer on for that reason. Knowing him as well as she did, it didn\u2019t take her long to discover his password, which he\u2019d listed on his Rolodex under P. She\u2019d explain when he got back. She retrieved the necessary information and was ready to close when a file with an odd name caught her attention. It consisted of several Chinese words, none of them familiar. Christian was fluent in Mandarin, but he named his files in English. Not only that, these words didn\u2019t seem to correspond with any of their suppliers in China. What made her open the file she\u2019d never know. Their relationship was strained as it was and neither of them had ever spoken of that night. For whatever reason\u2014idle curiosity or latent suspicion\u2014she did open the file. A hundred times since\u2014no, a thousand\u2014she\u2019d found herself wishing that she\u2019d left well enough alone. In that moment, she learned more than she\u2019d ever cared to know about the man who was her employer. She hadn\u2019t immediately understood what she was reading, but then it became all too apparent. Christian Dempsey was involved in smuggling illegal aliens from China, using his import business as a cover. At first she refused to believe it. But as she considered his actions since Christmas, certain details started to add up. She\u2019d assumed his uncharacteristic behavior was because of their night together. Now his activities seemed more sinister. He\u2019d begun to close the door between their offices, too, with strict orders that he wasn\u2019t to be disturbed. He was away for lengthy periods without explanation. And sometimes, always late in the day, he had guests who weren\u2019t announced by Reception. Guests he didn\u2019t introduce.</p> <p>Then, three weeks into the new year, Colette knew she could no longer ignore the obvious. A pregnancy test from the drug-store confirmed it. Under normal circumstances Colette would probably have discussed the situation with him. Not now. She wanted no further contact with Christian Dempsey. The biggest struggle was what to do with the information she had. For several sleepless nights, she debated the best course of action. Her conscience wouldn\u2019t allow her to ignore the fact that he was trafficking in humans. At the same time, she wondered if she could put the father of her child behind bars. In the end, she wrote an anonymous letter to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. One thing was certain\u2014she couldn\u2019t work for Christian anymore. As far as she could see, leaving was the only solution. Early one morning, she typed up her letter of resignation and placed it on his desk.</p><p>Colette wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d react when he read it. She soon found out. He called her into his office and glared at her. Then with a look so scornful it cut straight through her heart, he suggested she take her two-week vacation now and leave immediately. She nodded, convinced that he was aware of exactly what she\u2019d uncovered. Without a word, she turned and walked out. That was the last time she\u2019d seen or heard from Christian Dempsey.</p><p>Her house sold right away and she\u2019d obtained the job in the flower shop the next week. Fortunately, real estate in her part of Seattle moved quickly. When she heard about the apartment above the yarn store, it had seemed perfect. She was hiding from Christian, praying he wouldn\u2019t ever look for her. What she earned at the flower shop covered her meager expenses. The insurance money she\u2019d collected after Derek\u2019s accident, plus the proceeds from the house, had paid off her car and given her enough to make a few sizable investments. She was financially comfortable.</p><p>Too nauseous to eat, she swallowed the rest of her tea, washed her cup and dressed for the day. Colette had a new life now, a brand-new beginning. She was doing her best to prepare for her baby, trying to eat properly and taking prenatal vitamins. She\u2019d bought a copy of What to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting from the bookstore down the street, wishing she could have shared this whole experience with her husband. No one knew about the pregnancy yet, not even her parents. Until the authorities arrested Christian, she\u2019d keep it to herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she got to work, Susannah Nelson was already there, cataloging a shipment of fresh flowers. The scent of roses filled the shop.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Susannah greeted her absently, intent on her task.</p><p>\u201cMorning. Those smell gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do, don\u2019t they?\u201d Susannah looked up with a smile.</p> <p>With Valentine\u2019s Day the following week, they\u2019d received a huge shipment of roses, in addition to the flowers that arrived every other day. Colette\u2019s favorites were the antique roses with their intense fragrance, although they tended to be smaller and less colorful than the hybrids.</p><p>\u201cI expect we\u2019ll be extra busy today,\u201d Susannah said. This was her first full year of owning Susannah\u2019s Garden and she was learning as she went. \u201cOh, before I forget, there was a phone call yesterday afternoon, just after you left.\u201d</p><p>A chill went up Colette\u2019s spine. She\u2019d told only a few people where she\u2019d gone. \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>Susannah frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the name, but I wrote it down.\u201d Leaving the counter where she\u2019d been working, she walked over to the phone and sorted through a stack of pink message slips until she found the one she wanted.</p><p>\u201cThe call was from a Christian Dempsey. He said it was personal.\u201d</p> <p>Colette\u2019s hand felt numb as she accepted the slip. She glanced at the phone number, one she knew so well, and with her heart pounding, crumpled the note and tossed it in the garbage.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>\u201cWhen individual fibers are knitted together with a thread of emotion, they become an original, personal design. This creative process is my joyful obsession.\u201d</p><p>Emily Myles, Fiber Artist. www.emyles.com</p><p>Lydia Goetz</p><p>One of the joys of owning my yarn store is the pleasure I derive from teaching people how to knit. I wish I could explain how much delight it gives me to share my love of knitting with others. I know machines can create sweaters and mittens and other things cheaper, faster and far more efficiently. That\u2019s not the point. The projects I knit are an extension of me, an expression of my love for the person I\u2019m knitting for. And\u2014something else I love about knitting\u2014when I\u2019m working with my needles and yarn, I link myself with hundreds of thousands of women through the centuries.</p> <p>I was on my lunch break, sipping a mug of soup in my office as I reviewed the names on my latest class list.</p><p>I think if I\u2019d had a normal adolescence, I might have decided on teaching as a profession. Don\u2019t get me wrong, owning A Good Yarn is a dream come true for me. It\u2019s part of the woman I am now, the woman I\u2019ve become not because of the cancer, but in spite of it. I\u2019m proud of that.</p><p>What I especially love about my classes is getting to know my customers, some of whom are among my dearest friends. For example, in the very first beginning knitters\u2019 class I formed three years ago, I met Jacqueline Donovan, Carol Girard and Alix Townsend. We still see each other often, and they\u2019re as close to me as my own family. Over the last three years, I\u2019ve taught dozens of classes, but that first one will always hold a special place in my heart.</p><p>Certain of the other classes are also special to me. Like the sock-knitting class two years ago. That\u2019s where I met Bethanne Hamlin, Elise Beaumont and Courtney Pulanski. Bethanne is so busy with her party business these days I rarely see her, but Annie, her daughter, often stops by while she\u2019s running errands for her mother. Her friend, Amanda Jennings, another cancer survivor, comes with her whenever she can. Bethanne and I don\u2019t communicate regularly, but I consider her a good friend. Elise, too, although most of her time these days is spent nursing her husband, Maverick, whose cancer has taken a turn for the worse. Her tender patience brings tears to my eyes. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a couple more in love. Foolishly, I assumed that kind of love was reserved for the young, but Elise and Maverick have shown me otherwise. The way they love each other is what I pray for in my marriage with Brad.</p><p>Courtney Pulanski is at college in Chicago and teaching everyone in her dorm the benefits of knitting. She keeps in touch; I also hear how she\u2019s doing from Vera, her grandmother. After her mother\u2019s death, Courtney\u2019s dad took a job in South America, and Courtney went to live with her grandmother in Seattle for her senior year of high school. It wasn\u2019t an easy transition. I\u2019m proud of Courtney, who\u2019s become a lovely and well-liked young woman with a strong sense of her own potential, although I have little claim to her success.</p><p>It seems to me that each woman who signed up for one of my knitting classes taught me a valuable lesson. I suspect that\u2019s another reason I feel so close to many of them.</p><p>This new class, the one to knit a prayer shawl, has a good feel, although I wish more than three people had enrolled. The first person to sign up was Alix Townsend, which surprised me until she mentioned that she needs something to help with the prewedding stress. Because she\u2019s an experienced knitter, I suggested she attempt a more complicated pattern, and she agreed. She chose a beautiful lace shawl.</p><p>I certainly understand why Alix is feeling anxious. My own wedding was a low-key affair with just family and a few friends in attendance, yet I was an emotional wreck by the time Brad and I were officially married. Margaret didn\u2019t make things any easier. She fluttered around me with questions and criticisms and unwanted advice until I thought I\u2019d scream. But she was the one who broke into uncontrollable sobs halfway through the ceremony. My sister, for all her gruff exterior, has a soft heart and genuine compassion for others. I didn\u2019t figure that out until I was over thirty.</p> <p>That\u2019s because, until recently, my entire existence revolved around me. It was all I could do to deal with my disease. I was so focused on myself, I failed to notice other people as I should. That knowledge opened my eyes in any number of ways, and I\u2019ve learned to listen to others, including and perhaps especially Margaret. She still has her irritating mannerisms but I overlook them now\u2014for the most part\u2014and I try to ignore her suspicious reactions to people like Colette. I understand she\u2019s trying to protect me (patronizing though that is). I\u2019ve become much more tolerant, too. And I find myself reaching out more, getting involved in my neighborhood and business community.</p><p>Anyway...Alix signed up for the class; Susannah Nelson did, too. With Susannah\u2019s Garden she\u2019s brought a new energy to the retail neighborhood. She has such interesting and inventive ideas. In the beginning, she gave away more flowers than she sold but the strategy paid off and her shop\u2019s doing well. Since Susannah and I hadn\u2019t had much opportunity to know each other, I welcomed her presence in the knitting class.</p><p>Colette Blake, my tenant, enrolled, too, with Susannah\u2019s encouragement. She\u2019d stopped coming by for tea in the mornings and I knew why. She\u2019d obviously overheard Margaret\u2019s comment. Ever since that morning, our conversations were brief and a bit stilted. She\u2019d started using the outside entrance right afterward. I missed her.</p><p>Because Susannah and Colette were both taking the class, I\u2019d purposely scheduled it later in the afternoon. At four-thirty, Susannah\u2019s college-age daughter, Chrissie, would be available to work at the flower shop and Alix would have finished her shift at the caf\u00e9.</p><p>The bell above the door jingled and I was distracted from my lunch break. Thankfully, Margaret was out front. She\u2019s increasingly more comfortable dealing with customers, although she can sometimes seem brusque and unfriendly. That\u2019s a shame because she isn\u2019t really like that.</p><p>A minute later, Margaret came into the office. \u201cDo we have any yarn made from soy beans?\u201d she asked, frowning. \u201cI never heard of such a thing.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed my soup. \u201cI have some on order.\u201d</p><p>Margaret\u2019s frown darkened. \u201cYou\u2019re joking! There\u2019s actually a yarn made from soy?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the fibers being used for yarn these days.\u201d Margaret should\u2019ve known all this, but she prefers wool, as do I. However, I can\u2019t discount the incredible ribbon yarns and some of the newer acrylics. There\u2019s even buffalo yarn\u2014or should that be bison?\u2014and I\u2019ve heard about a yarn from New Zealand that\u2019s a blend of wool and possum fur, of all things.</p><p>My sister shook her head in wonder and left me to my lunch and my thoughts once more. I\u2019m so grateful the shop has brought Margaret and me together after all the difficulties we faced in our relationship. A few years ago I would never have believed that possible.</p><p>Margaret hadn\u2019t supported my efforts in the beginning and in retrospect I can\u2019t blame her. I\u2019d never taken a single business class or even worked at a full-time job. Margaret was afraid I\u2019d set myself up for failure; as it turned out, she was wrong. Later I could see how much I\u2019d absorbed about business from my father. He\u2019d taught Margaret and me a strong work ethic, too. Our dad had his own business for years, and almost by osmosis I learned a lot from him without even realizing it.</p><p>After I finished my lunch, I joined my sister. We did a steady business for the rest of the afternoon. I counted up more than forty sales by four o\u2019clock, which is excellent for a two-person shop. Another bonus\u2014the days pass quickly and pleasurably when we\u2019re busy like this.</p><p>\u201cJulia\u2019s late.\u201d Margaret glanced at her watch for the fifth time in the last minute.</p><p>\u201cYou let her take the car to school again?\u201d</p><p>Margaret nodded curtly but wouldn\u2019t look at me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t remind her that she\u2019d sworn the new car was hers and Julia wasn\u2019t going to drive it ever. She hadn\u2019t owned the car for more than a few weeks and already my niece was behind the wheel more often than my sister.</p><p>\u201cShe was supposed to come by for me right after school,\u201d Margaret muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a good reason she\u2019s late,\u201d I told her. Julia was a high-school senior and so involved with myriad activities her schedule made my head swim.</p><p>\u201cNot today. She\u2019s got a dental appointment at four-thirty and I\u2019m going with her.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at my own watch and noticed it was four-ten. \u201cShe\u2019ll be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>Margaret nodded.</p><p>\u201cSince she\u2019s late, why don\u2019t you get your coat and purse and wait outside?\u201d</p><p>Margaret hesitated, but finally agreed. She disappeared into the office only long enough to collect what she needed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d I reassured Margaret again. Julia was a responsible girl and I didn\u2019t think for an instant that she\u2019d forgotten her mother.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s twenty minutes to the dentist\u2019s office from here,\u201d Margaret worried.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to phone ahead and let them know you might be late?\u201d</p><p>Margaret considered that, then nodded. Her frown grew even fiercer, and I didn\u2019t envy Julia once she did arrive. The wrath of Margaret was something to behold. My sister didn\u2019t lose her temper often but when she did she could clear a room.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and step outside. I\u2019ll contact the dentist\u2019s office right now.\u201d</p><p>Margaret pushed open the door, and the bell chimed as she left the shop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stepping up to the counter, I reached for the Rolodex and flipped to the Ds, where Margaret had filed the dentist\u2019s number.</p><p>The receptionist answered on the second ring. \u201cDr. Wentworth\u2019s office. How may I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m calling on behalf of Julia Langley. It looks like she\u2019s running late and I wanted you to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me how late she\u2019s going to be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh...I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s going to be more than ten minutes, the appointment will need to be rescheduled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be that long, but it depends on traffic,\u201d I said, although I had no idea when Julia would show up. I could see Margaret pacing back and forth in front of the display window. Every step she took conveyed nervous agitation.</p><p>\u201cPlease call again to reschedule if it is later than ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I told her and replaced the receiver.</p> <p>I remembered then that Julia had a cell phone, one she paid for with money she earned from a part-time job at the movie theater. I\u2019d driven five miles out of my way to take Cody to the theater where Julia worked. Cody had loved seeing his cousin behind the counter. Julia had given him extra butter on his popcorn and my son had been thrilled.</p><p>\u201cMargaret,\u201d I called, poking my head out the front door. \u201cWhat about her cell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s at the house,\u201d Margaret snapped. \u201cShe let the battery go dead.\u201d Her frown told me she saw this as another example of Julia\u2019s lack of responsibility. My poor niece was about to get an earful.</p><p>The phone pealed sharply behind me. \u201cA Good Yarn,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cMargaret Langley, please.\u201d</p><p>The crisp, professional male voice took me aback. It didn\u2019t matter what the words said, what I heard was trouble. \u201cCould you tell me what this is about?\u201d I asked as politely as my trembling voice would allow.</p> <p>\u201cI need to speak directly to Ms. Langley,\u201d the man told me.</p><p>\u201cOne minute, please.\u201d I set down the receiver and rushed to the front door.</p><p>Margaret swung around to face me almost as if she knew.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a call for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...you\u2019d better take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Julia will be here any second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the call,\u201d I insisted.</p> <p>I so rarely insist on anything with my sister that Margaret\u2019s brows rose abruptly. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She hurried into the shop and grabbed the receiver. \u201cThis is Margaret Langley.\u201d</p><p>She listened for a moment and then her eyes shot to mine. She gasped. Her knees literally went out from under her and she sank into the chair I kept behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cIs she hurt?\u201d Margaret asked shakily.</p><p>I bit my lip, awaiting the answer.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019ll be here.\u201d She replaced the receiver, looked at me and burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cW-what is it?\u201d I asked, starting to cry, too. \u201cHas Julia been in an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...The police are coming to take me to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia\u2019s in the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, she\u2019s been hurt but they won\u2019t tell me how badly. The hospital needs me to sign the papers before they can take her into surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurgery.\u201d I swallowed painfully. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I cried, gripping my sister\u2019s arm. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe...Julia was on her way to pick me up, just like you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d I knew Julia wouldn\u2019t have forgotten.</p><p>\u201cShe stopped at a red light and someone, a man, ran up to the driver\u2019s side and yanked open the door and\u2014\u201d</p><p>The picture that formed in my mind sent my nerves shrieking in protest. \u201cJulia was carjacked?\u201d</p><p>Margaret nodded. \u201cHe dragged her into the street and when she tried to fight him off, he...he hit her again. Then he threw her into moving traffic so she had to scramble for her life.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth with both hands to stifle a scream. My beautiful niece had been attacked. I didn\u2019t know the extent of her injuries but apparently they were bad enough to require surgery.</p><p>The shock of this, the horror I felt, was more than I could take in.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Colette Blake</p><p>Learning to knit might fill up some of the lonely hours, Colette reasoned. Susannah had convinced her to give it a try. To her surprise, Colette discovered she was actually looking forward to the first class next Wednesday. Perhaps that was because knitting suggested an image of peace and contentment. She could picture a heavily pregnant version of herself sitting in the comfortable chair Lydia had left behind, knitting something for her baby.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t told anyone yet. Within a few months, though, keeping her pregnancy a secret would be impossible. At this point, Colette didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do once the baby was born, where she\u2019d live, or even whether she should tell Christian about his child. With no firm plan in mind, she decided to wait until she saw how the authorities responded to her anonymous letter. She assumed she\u2019d find out from the news\u2014or she could always call Jenny at the office. Jenny would be happy to hear from her, despite their lack of recent contact.</p><p>The flower shop had been frantic with activity this morning\u2014not unexpected, this close to Valentine\u2019s Day. Susannah\u2019s daughter, Chrissie, who\u2019d transferred from the University of Oregon to the University of Washington, had agreed to step in one afternoon a week in order to free up Susannah and Colette for the class. There were advantages for Chrissie, too. She wanted to learn the business and prove she was a responsible adult; not only that, she\u2019d be making some extra money.</p><p>The class project was a prayer shawl, which Colette hoped to use as a blanket for her baby. Lydia had said the idea of knitting a prayer shawl was to make it for someone in need of prayer or healing. Colette certainly needed both.</p><p>At the shop the previous week, Colette had met Chrissie, who seemed like a typical undergraduate\u2014alternately self-confident and insecure. She was ebullient with a natural charm she put to good use in the shop. Chrissie was close to her mother and Colette envied her that closeness. Her own relationship with her parents was fine, although there\u2019d never been the kind of easy banter Chrissie enjoyed with Susannah. Still, she wished they weren\u2019t so far away, especially now. On the other hand, it could be awkward if they lived nearby. Colette hadn\u2019t told them about the baby; if she did, she knew they\u2019d insist she tell Christian and she couldn\u2019t do that\u2014at least, not yet. She felt suspended between her past and her future, unable to move ahead with the new life she\u2019d begun.</p><p>She explained to her parents that she\u2019d stayed because Seattle was familiar and comfortable and her home. That was true, but she also wanted to remain in town until she found out what would happen to Christian.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t dark as early in the afternoons now, but by four, the shadows started to lengthen. Colette liked watching the activity on Blossom Street as the streetlights came on, illuminating the sidewalk. She\u2019d been assembling a funeral wreath, adding white carnations and filling the space between the flowers with salal, an evergreen that grew wild in the area, when Susannah returned from an appointment.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d Colette asked, knowing her employer had been nervous about meeting with the director of one of the largest privately owned funeral homes in downtown Seattle. Susannah had recently tendered a proposal to provide floral arrangements for prearranged funerals, which included an allotment for flowers, and had been asked to stop by to discuss her bid with the director.</p><p>Susannah removed her jacket and hung it on the peg in the back room. \u201cThe meeting went really well,\u201d she said, looking hopeful. \u201cI should know by the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Colette wanted Susannah to succeed. For the moment, of course, she hoped to keep her job, and the better her employer did financially, the better for her. That wasn\u2019t the entire reason, however. Colette liked Susannah, who\u2019d hired her after a brief interview in which she\u2019d asked a minimum of questions. Fortunately, she hadn\u2019t requested references. Afterward Susannah admitted Colette was the first person she\u2019d ever interviewed and she was simply following her instincts.</p><p>Working side by side as they did every day, it was only natural that they\u2019d develop a friendship, although Colette hadn\u2019t shared anything very personal. Their conversations tended to be about Susannah\u2019s family, about books they\u2019d loved and people on Blossom Street. Colette had, early on, described the external facts of her life\u2014schooling, marriage, widowhood, and some vague details about her job. She held her memories of Derek close to her heart. They\u2019d had a good marriage. The only real problem they\u2019d encountered had been her inability to conceive. She\u2019d loved her husband deeply and still grieved for him. At the same time, her feelings for Christian Dempsey confused her. During the past year she hadn\u2019t been honest enough to admit her growing attraction to him, which had culminated in their one night together. She wanted to believe their lovemaking had been more than physical hunger between two lonely people. That hope was dashed when she went back to work after Christmas. Without his ever saying a word, she knew he regretted that night, regretted everything about it. He seemed preoccupied and worried; foolishly, Colette had assumed this uncharacteristic behavior had to do with her. She didn\u2019t understand exactly what he\u2019d gotten himself into or why he\u2019d risk the business he\u2019d worked so hard to build. All she could figure was that he\u2019d found himself in financial trouble. Either that or he was being blackmailed. Whatever the reason, she wanted no part of it, or any association with him.</p><p>Susannah spoke, and Colette gratefully turned her thoughts away from Christian Dempsey.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I expected of Mr. Olson,\u201d Susannah said as she slipped the big apron around her neck and deftly tied it at her waist. \u201cBut then I don\u2019t normally hang around funeral parlors,\u201d she added. \u201cHe was so friendly. But not somber, you know? Just genuine and low-key. Later I saw him talking to a family who\u2019d lost a loved one and he had such a gentle, reassuring manner.\u201d She gave a light shrug. \u201cI was impressed with him\u2014and I hope he felt the same way about me.\u201d</p><p>Colette knew that if Susannah received the funeral-home contract it would be a huge boost for the shop. Her only experience with funerals had been Derek\u2019s, which was a blur in her mind. His parents had flown in from Chicago and handled almost everything, making all the decisions about their son\u2019s interment. In her benumbed state, she\u2019d been glad to let them do it. While sitting in the waiting room, Colette remembered glancing through a brochure about prepaid plans. She would never have guessed it might one day be part of her own job.</p><p>\u201cI assured Mr. Olson that while I\u2019m new to this business, I have every intention of being around for a long time. Joe helped me prepare what to say. He\u2019s been so wonderful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colette admired Susannah\u2019s husband, Joe, and the way he supported and encouraged his wife and her new venture. She envied them their loving partnership. She wondered if her own marriage would have deepened into that mature love. She liked to think it would have. But her husband was dead\u2014and Colette was pregnant with another man\u2019s child.</p><p>The phone rang just then and Colette answered it. As she started entering the details of an order, the front door opened and someone came into the shop. Susannah stepped out front to deal with the customer.</p><p>Colette finished writing up the order\u2014a bouquet to congratulate new parents on their baby. The flowers would be delivered to a local hospital that afternoon. Because the business was small, Susannah had hired a delivery service. The driver stopped by once a day to pick up the orders. Flower arrangements like this one, for joyous occasions, brought Susannah and Colette the most pleasure. Funeral wreaths and arrangements were a staple of the business, but Colette knew from her own experience that no quantity of flowers, regardless of how exotic or expensive, would ease the ache of having lost a family member. The point was to honor the person who\u2019d died and to express condolences to the living.</p><p>Susannah returned to the back room. \u201cThere\u2019s a man out front who wants to speak to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA man?\u201d It could only be one person.</p><p>Susannah stared at the business card in her hand. \u201cChristian Dempsey. Isn\u2019t he the man who left a phone message last week?\u201d</p><p>Colette nodded jerkily. She hadn\u2019t called Christian back, which was probably stupid on her part. It was absurd to think he wouldn\u2019t be able to find her. Knowing him as well as she did, she should have realized her lack of response would only heighten his desire to confront her.</p><p>Squaring her shoulders, Colette moved slowly into the front of the shop and stood behind the counter. She would listen to whatever he had to say and pray that would be the end of it. However, nothing could have prepared her for the impact of seeing him again.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that his appearance had changed. Christian looked just the same as he had last month. As soon as she entered the room, his eyes flew to hers.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Dempsey,\u201d she said formally, which seemed a little ridiculous when she\u2019d lain naked in his arms. But politeness offered her an emotional buffer she badly needed.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIn light of...uh, recent events, calling me by my first name might be more appropriate.\u201d</p><p>She studied him, not sure if he was making fun of her. What would be appropriate, Colette felt like saying, was to avoid any mention of their encounter at the hotel. \u201cAll right. Christian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get my message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I did.\u201d She didn\u2019t offer any explanation as to why she hadn\u2019t returned his call.</p><p>His eyes narrowed ever so slightly. Anyone else might not have noticed. Colette did. After five years of working with him, she was all too aware of the nuances that relayed his mood and his thoughts. He wasn\u2019t pleased with her, and everything about him, his look, his stance, the set of his shoulders, told her so. She could only surmise that he\u2019d discovered she was the one who\u2019d written the letter. Coward that she was, Colette had no intention of bringing it up.</p> <p>His gaze continued to hold hers. \u201cI\u2019d like to speak with you for a few minutes. Privately.\u201d</p><p>He knew. \u201cThat\u2019s...not possible. I\u2019m working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>Nothing would intimidate walk-in customers faster than an irritated Christian Dempsey.</p><p>Colette hesitated and then reluctantly gave in. It wouldn\u2019t do any good to put this off, she decided; he\u2019d only come back. \u201cI\u2019ll see if my employer can spare me.\u201d</p><p>Christian responded with a curt nod and she hurried to ask Susannah if she could leave early.</p><p>\u201cWho is that guy?\u201d Susannah whispered the minute Colette reappeared.</p><p>\u201cMy former boss. Would it be okay if I left now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith him?\u201d Susannah frowned, clearly concerned.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like we have a lot to say to each other.\u201d In Colette\u2019s opinion, this conversation should take about five seconds. Her biggest worry was how she\u2019d feel afterward. The attraction was still there, despite everything she knew about him.</p><p>\u201cTake all the time you need,\u201d Susannah told her. \u201cJust promise me that speaking to this man is something you want to do.\u201d</p><p>It was, and it definitely wasn\u2019t. \u201cI need to,\u201d she said, letting that explanation suffice.</p><p>Christian was waiting for her out front. Ever the gentleman, he held the door for her as they left the flower shop. She half expected some comment on the type of employment she\u2019d taken after leaving Dempsey Imports. He said nothing.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a caf\u00e9 across the street,\u201d he said, gesturing toward the French Caf\u00e9 with its striped awning. One of the windows displayed a multitude of baked delicacies and through the other they could see small tables and chairs.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go for a short walk instead?\u201d She didn\u2019t want anyone from the caf\u00e9 to listen in on their conversation.</p><p>Christian was agreeable. They spoke briefly, exchanging pleasantries as they strolled down Blossom Street. Christian walked with his hands behind his back, careful to keep pace with her shorter strides. What struck Colette was the way they both struggled to maintain a facade of unfamiliarity. They acted like strangers when they so obviously weren\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Christian asked. He turned to look at her as if he possessed the uncanny ability to see straight through her, which in fact he did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very well, thank you.\u201d She hoped her voice didn\u2019t reveal how on edge she really felt.</p><p>\u201cI mean, how are you...physically?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>\u201cPhysically?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to spell it out for you?\u201d His words were impatient. \u201cIf I remember correctly, neither of us took the time to employ any measures to prevent pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Embarrassment lit up her cheeks brighter than the red signal light at the intersection. \u201cI\u2019m fine. There\u2019s...nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to believe her.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s all,\u201d she said, ready to part company, \u201cI should be getting back.\u201d Her mind was crowded with questions and accusations. She\u2019d never taken Christian for a fool and yet she had proof that he was trafficking in Chinese aliens. Seeing him confused her. She didn\u2019t want to think about him or give him reasons to suspect she carried his child. The sooner they said their good-byes, the better.</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s more,\u201d he countered sharply. He hesitated, as though he wasn\u2019t sure how to formulate the next question. After a brief pause, he blurted out, \u201cI\u2019d like you to return to Dempsey Imports.\u201d</p><p>His request shocked her, and Colette automatically shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>When the light changed, they crossed the street and continued walking, no real destination in mind.</p><p>Christian waited until they were on the other side. \u201cIs it because of what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian,\u201d she murmured and instantly knew he hadn\u2019t found out about the letter. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work. It\u2019s unfortunate and I feel bad, but that night will always stand between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd day.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to be trying to add to her embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cFine, and that day,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Working together is no longer an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said regretfully. \u201cI realize I made a mistake after the holidays. The relationship changed and I had no idea how to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the only thing that had changed, she thought sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cI pretended nothing was different between us,\u201d he went on. \u201cBut it was...is. You\u2019ve made your point. We need to discuss this like two mature adults and reach an understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss it. And there\u2019s nothing to understand. We made a regrettable mistake. Blame it on too much champagne, too much Christmas spirit.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows.</p><p>Colette stared down at the sidewalk. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cEverything\u2019s changed, Christian. I can\u2019t go back to being your assistant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we both consider what happened at the Christmas party a slip in judgment and let it go at that? You\u2019re a valuable employee. The company needs you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe company?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He exhaled slowly. \u201cI need you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI want you to come back.\u201d</p><p>Colette supposed she should be flattered, since Christian Dempsey rarely admitted to needing anyone or anything. \u201cIt isn\u2019t possible,\u201d she said and she meant it. \u201cWe can\u2019t undo what\u2019s already been done. Don\u2019t you see that?\u201d He couldn\u2019t honestly expect her to resume managing his schedule, his travel arrangements and his dates. As soon as he learned she\u2019d contacted the authorities, he\u2019d fire her anyway.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Were you hiding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that difficult. I had Accounting contact your bank and get the new address\u2014to mail your severance documents.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, feeling a bit foolish. But she couldn\u2019t resist another question. \u201cDid you hire a new assistant yet?\u201d She could have asked any of the friends she\u2019d made through the years. But the company must be rife with gossip and rumors as to why she\u2019d quit so abruptly, and for that reason, Colette hadn\u2019t called anyone at Dempsey Imports. Getting in touch with them to ask for information like that was a last resort.</p><p>\u201cLloyd York,\u201d Christian said.</p><p>\u201cLloyd,\u201d she repeated. She tried unsuccessfully to remember a face to go with the name. \u201cI don\u2019t know him.\u201d As much as possible, Christian made it a practice to promote and hire within the company.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a temp.\u201d</p><p>Colette felt her eyes widen. Christian disliked using personnel from a temporary agency and until now he\u2019d avoided it. The fact that he\u2019d looked outside the company only underlined his guilt. What she didn\u2019t understand was his reason for wanting her back. Surely he knew she\u2019d uncover his activities sooner or later.</p><p>\u201cI hoped you\u2019d come to your senses and return voluntarily. When I didn\u2019t hear from you, I had no choice but to contact you myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian, I\u2019m sorry, sorrier than you know. But I\u2019m not going to change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you won\u2019t reconsider?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She closed her eyes. Despite everything, she missed him, missed the demands and challenges of her position. Not a day passed that she didn\u2019t think of him. She wanted to tell him about the baby but knew she couldn\u2019t until everything had played out. Needless to say, she couldn\u2019t predict how or when that would take place.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come back, Colette. I can feel it. Tell me what\u2019s stopping you and I\u2019ll make it right. You want a raise, fine. I\u2019ll double whatever your salary was before.

Author of numerous knitting books, including Lace Style, coauthored with Pam Allen (Spring 2007) and Getting Started Knitting Socks, Fall 2007, Interweave Press</p> <p>Lydia Goetz</p><p>If today wasn\u2019t the first knitting class for the prayer shawl, I would\u2019ve closed the shop in order to be with Margaret and Julia. My niece was in bad shape. The hospital had kept her for two days after setting the pin in her arm, which was badly broken. Her face was swollen and bruised. I could barely look at her and not cry. It was beyond my imagination that anyone would do something like this to my beautiful Julia. More damaging than the physical injuries was what this carjacking had done to her emotionally.</p><p>To her and to my sister! I\u2019d never seen Margaret angrier. At the hospital she paced the waiting room snarling like a wounded beast, snapping at the staff, demanding answers and generally making a nuisance of herself. I couldn\u2019t even talk to her. I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened if not for Matt. My brother-in-law handled the situation so tactfully. Again and again, he reminded Margaret that Julia was alive. The loss of the car was of no consequence as long as their daughter had survived the attack. Insurance would replace the vehicle but nothing could ever replace their child.</p><p>The door opened on this bleak Wednesday afternoon, and Alix walked into the shop. I was pleased that she\u2019d decided to sign up for another class, although she didn\u2019t really need one, since she\u2019s turned into an accomplished knitter. Because Colette and Susannah were beginners, I\u2019d offered to teach two patterns, one a simple prayer shawl, and the other, for Alix, a more elaborate, complicated lace pattern. She required a challenge, otherwise she\u2019d quickly grow bored. She also needed distraction, and I figured this lace pattern would do the trick.</p><p>I was so grateful to see her I almost broke into tears. I\u2019d been so distraught by the assault on Julia that my emotions were completely off-kilter.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear?\u201d I asked, struggling to keep my voice from shaking.</p> <p>Alix nodded. \u201cHow\u2019s Julia doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came home after a couple of days in the hospital but she refuses to see anyone other than family.\u201d With her face swollen and discolored, Julia was afraid of what her friends would say. She\u2019d immediately gone into her bedroom and hadn\u2019t come out. I understood better than anyone might have guessed. After my first brain surgery, my head swathed in bandages, I\u2019d been terribly self-conscious. Little did I realize this was just the beginning of my ordeal. I wouldn\u2019t allow my friends to see me, either, and later, when I was lonely and depressed, there were only a few who\u2019d hung on. In retrospect, I knew I was responsible for sending them away; I hoped Julia didn\u2019t repeat my mistake.</p><p>All I could do was pray for my niece and give her my love and support. Her arm would mend and the bruises fade, but I doubted she\u2019d ever be the same lighthearted girl she\u2019d been a week ago.</p><p>The car thief had stolen more than their vehicle that day. He\u2019d also taken Julia\u2019s innocent trust that the world was decent and safe. He\u2019d blindsided my sister and Matt, too. Whoever he was, this man had a great deal to answer for.</p><p>\u201cDid the boys in blue find the guy who did it?\u201d Alix asked as she sauntered up to the table in the back room of the shop. That was where I held my classes. She set down her backpack and took out the yarn and needles she\u2019d purchased earlier in the week.</p><p>\u201cNo word yet.\u201d Frankly, I didn\u2019t have much hope. The officer who\u2019d talked to Margaret explained that the car was probably on a container ship in the Port of Seattle within a day of the attack. Apparently the new car my sister had chosen was one of the most desirable vehicles on the black market. The whole family had been so proud of their first brand-new car, and this only added to the burden of Margaret\u2019s guilt.</p><p>\u201cIf I were you, I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath,\u201d Alix muttered.</p><p>I knew Alix distrusted the police. I should\u2019ve said something positive to counter her cynicism, but I didn\u2019t feel like arguing. Besides, it wasn\u2019t getting the car back that was important to my sister. It was justice she wanted. Justice she demanded. Margaret wasn\u2019t one to easily forgive and forget, and she was fiercely protective of her family, especially her daughters Julia and eleven-year-old Hailey.</p> <p>The bell chimed a second time and in strolled Susannah and Colette. All three women had already bought the necessary needles and yarn and I\u2019d supplied the pattern as part of the class fee. Because Colette and Susannah were new knitters, most of my time would be spent helping them.</p><p>\u201cSusannah, Colette, this is my friend Alix,\u201d I said. \u201cShe works at the French Caf\u00e9, so you\u2019ve probably seen her around the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>Alix shrugged her shoulder in an unfriendly manner. Her attitude reminded me of the way she\u2019d acted during my first knitting class, when she\u2019d sat across from Jacqueline Donovan. I hadn\u2019t seen this side of Alix in a long while and knew something must be troubling her. Once more I bit my tongue.</p><p>\u201cColette, why don\u2019t you introduce yourself,\u201d I said, hoping to begin the class on a more optimistic note.</p><p>\u201cWell, I obviously know Susannah and Lydia, and I\u2019ve seen Alix at the caf\u00e9. I\u2019m Colette Blake.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t offer any other information, I prompted her. \u201cTell us about yourself,\u201d I urged.</p><p>Colette looked at Alix. \u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Again Alix answered with that halfhearted shrug. \u201cNothing, unless it\u2019s some little fact you\u2019re dying to tell me.\u201d</p><p>I could no longer remain silent. \u201cAlix!\u201d I snapped, telling her I found her behavior downright rude.</p><p>She had the good grace to apologize. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Colette, I\u2019ve had a rotten day. Please, tell me about yourself.\u201d</p><p>Colette shook her head. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t have anything to say. I\u2019d prefer it if we just started the class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, everyone,\u201d Susannah inserted. \u201cThis is supposed to be a fun class. We\u2019re knitting a prayer shawl, for heaven\u2019s sake! Not a bulletproof vest.\u201d</p><p>That made me smile. \u201cOkay, Susannah, why don\u2019t you take a turn?\u201d I said. She, at least, seemed willing to chat.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she began, \u201cas everyone here knows, I bought Susannah\u2019s Garden last September. It\u2019s a real change from my teaching position, which I had for over twenty-four years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you quit teaching?\u201d Alix asked, sitting a bit straighter.</p><p>\u201cI was in a rut,\u201d Susannah explained. \u201cBurned out. Without realizing it, I\u2019d lost my enthusiasm. When I started teaching, I loved every minute of it. Back then, I almost hated to see the school year end. The last year I taught, I couldn\u2019t wait for summer and I realized I was cheating my students\u2014and myself.\u201d</p><p>Alix\u2019s question made me wonder if she wanted to have her own bakery one day, the way Susannah had opened a florist\u2019s business. I found that an exciting idea, but wasn\u2019t sure how Jordan would feel about it.</p><p>\u201cWhy a flower shop?\u201d Colette asked, leaning forward.</p><p>Susannah gestured expansively. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a beautiful garden and my mother did, too. I guess I inherited my love for flowers from her. Actually, I would never have thought of owning a flower shop if not for my husband. Joe knows me best.\u201d She paused and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll amend that. On a good day, he can be astonishingly intuitive about me and what I need. He\u2019s the one who checked out the For Sale sign at Fanny\u2019s Floral and talked to the previous owner. When he suggested I buy the shop, I knew right away that it was exactly what I should do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like being your own boss?\u201d Alix asked.</p><p>\u201cI absolutely love it,\u201d Susannah said fervently. \u201cAlthough I have to tell you I\u2019ve never worked harder in my life.\u201d</p><p>Alix looked out the window at the French Caf\u00e9. I knew she\u2019d once dreamed of working in such a place and her dream had become a reality, the same way mine had.</p><p>\u201cSay, Alix, didn\u2019t someone tell me you\u2019re getting married in June?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>Alix nodded, but not with much vigor. I feared her bad day was directly related to the wedding. I wish I knew what had set her off. But Alix isn\u2019t one to freely share her troubles; I suppose that kind of reserve comes from having only herself to rely on all those years. She\u2019d been living on her own from the time she was sixteen.</p><p>\u201cHave you ordered the wedding flowers yet?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>Alix squirmed again. \u201cI\u2019m leaving that up to Jordan\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want a say in the matter?\u201d Colette asked, glancing at Susannah and then at me.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Alix reached for the knitting needles and yarn as if the subject bored her.</p><p>\u201cBut flowers are an important part of the wedding,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t made a single decision yet,\u201d Alix broke in. \u201cWhy would I start now?\u201d She turned to me. \u201cAre we going to talk all afternoon or are we going to knit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnit.\u201d Apparently the wedding was a subject best avoided. I picked up the needles and a skein of yarn. \u201cThere are various ways to cast on stitches,\u201d I explained as I inserted my index finger into each end of the rolled yarn. I\u2019ve developed my own method of finding the end and pulling it through the skein. To be honest, I\u2019m not always successful. Fortunately, this time I looked like a genius. I pulled out the end, then had Susannah and Colette do the same.</p><p>Finding the end of the yarn was a good ice-breaker and I was sorry I hadn\u2019t started with that. Alix clearly wasn\u2019t in a talkative mood, and Colette didn\u2019t seem interested in sharing a single piece of information about herself. I assumed she\u2019d be willing to tell Alix that she was a recent widow. Or maybe she thought Alix had already heard. Then again, Colette might prefer to keep her grief about Derek\u2019s death private.</p><p>I continued by showing Colette and Susannah how to cast on stitches by knitting them onto the needle. It\u2019s not my favorite way of casting on; however, I find it one of the less complicated methods. It\u2019s also an effective prelude to learning the basic knitting stitch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alix had completed the first inch of the pattern before Colette had finished casting on and counting her stitches.</p><p>Colette frowned as she looked across the table. \u201cYou know how to knit,\u201d she complained. \u201cWhy are you taking the class?\u201d</p><p>Alix glanced up and made brief eye contact with me. \u201cJordan\u2014my fianc\u00e9\u2014suggested it might help calm my nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting this,\u201d Susannah groaned and set the needles and yarn aside. \u201cI thought this was supposed to be relaxing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot necessarily at the beginning,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Susannah muttered.</p><p>Alix burst out laughing. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen me when I was learning. Jacqueline turned three shades of purple when I dropped my first stitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I recall,\u201d I said, grinning at the memory, \u201cit wasn\u2019t because you dropped a stitch but because of how you reacted\u2014with a whole vocabulary of swearwords.\u201d</p><p>Alix\u2019s lips quivered with amusement. \u201cI\u2019ve toned down my language, so don\u2019t worry, ladies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to say anything I haven\u2019t heard from my kids,\u201d Susannah told her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too sure.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I raised my hand. \u201cAre you two going to get into a swearing match?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d Susannah said as she finished her first real stitch. The tension was so tight, it amazed me that she could actually transfer the yarn from one needle to the other. She heaved a sigh and turned to me for approval, as though she\u2019d achieved something heroic.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said as I leaned over to examine her work.</p><p>\u201cI need some help,\u201d Colette moaned, the yarn a tangled mess on the table.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t tell exactly what she\u2019d managed to do, but there was nothing I hadn\u2019t seen in the last three years. I soon corrected her mistake and again showed her the basic stitch, standing behind her to make sure she understood. If I did the knitting for her, that would accomplish nothing. She had to do this on her own.</p><p>\u201cI agree with Susannah,\u201d she said after a few minutes. \u201cThis has got to be the most nerve-racking activity I\u2019ve ever tried. When does the relaxing part begin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just happens,\u201d Alix told them both. \u201cAll at once you\u2019ll be knitting and you won\u2019t even need to count the stitches. The first thing I made was a baby blanket, and after every single row I had to stop and make sure I hadn\u2019t accidentally increased or dropped a stitch. By comparison, the prayer shawl you\u2019re doing is easy.\u201d</p><p>I had to admit Alix was right. The baby blanket had been an ambitious project. I\u2019d chosen it because it required about ten classes. If I\u2019d started with anything smaller, like a cotton wash-cloth, I would\u2019ve needed only one, possibly two, sessions. The blanket justified the number of classes I\u2019d scheduled.</p><p>\u201cWho are you knitting your prayer shawl for?\u201d I asked Susannah.</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d she answered without hesitation. \u201cShe\u2019s doing really well, better than I expected after we...after I moved her into an assisted living complex in Colville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy own mother\u2019s in assisted living, as well,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it must be a worry living so far from her.\u201d Margaret and I shared the responsibility of checking up on Mom and spending time with her.</p><p>We hadn\u2019t told Mom what had happened to Julia. It would only have distressed her. I was afraid she might\u2019ve guessed something was wrong because Margaret hadn\u2019t been by in several days. Mom, however, hadn\u2019t seemed to notice.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad,\u201d Susannah said, responding to my comment. \u201cWe talk every day, Mom and I.\u201d She paused, biting down on her tongue as she carefully wrapped the yarn around the needle. \u201cI have a good friend who stops by periodically and lets me know how Mom\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would we do without friends,\u201d I said, and saw how Alix instantly looked up. She seemed calmer now.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Alix? Have you decided who you\u2019ll give the prayer shawl to?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAt first I thought I\u2019d keep it for myself. I\u2019m going to need plenty of prayers to get through this wedding, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d She grinned, shaking her head, and continued knitting. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to give it to Jordan\u2019s grandmother. I think she\u2019ll really like the fact that I knit it for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she will,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat about you, Colette?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t raise her head. \u201cI might just keep it. Does that sound selfish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d I assured her. I realized that the act of knitting had already worked its magic on all of us. Alix had come in stressed and ill-tempered, on edge about the wedding. Colette, too, had been nervous and unhappy, for reasons I didn\u2019t know. I was certainly upset, because of what had happened to my niece and to Margaret. Susannah had her own struggles, launching a new business. We were relaxed now, talking together, laughing, knitting.</p><p>Knitting had linked us all.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>Alix Townsend</p><p>Finished for the day, Alix poured herself a cup of coffee, then sat down at the staff table in the bakery\u2019s back room and put her feet up on the chair across from her. The French Caf\u00e9 did a thriving business and she liked to think she\u2019d played a role in that success. Her muffins, coffee cakes, cookies, sweet rolls and cakes, baked fresh every morning, had attracted a following of regular customers.</p><p>Molly, one of the baristas, stuck her head into the kitchen. \u201cJordan\u2019s here,\u201d she announced in a tone that said Alix was lucky to have met a man like him. But Alix already knew that.</p><p>\u201cJordan? Here? Now?\u201d she asked. They weren\u2019t supposed to meet for another hour.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like Jordan, talks like Jordan, walks like Jordan. My guess is, it is Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute,\u201d Alix said, saluting Molly\u2019s wit with her coffee mug.</p><p>\u201cWant me to send him back here?\u201d</p><p>Alix nodded, even though she was a mess. If he\u2019d waited an hour as they\u2019d originally planned, she\u2019d have showered and changed clothes. Seeing that he hadn\u2019t, he\u2019d have to take her as she was, which at the moment was tired.</p><p>Jordan appeared, and she lowered her feet and motioned toward the vacant chair. He pulled it up to the table with one hand, holding a disposable container of coffee in the other. Leaning back in the chair, he smiled.</p><p>\u201cDid I get the time wrong?\u201d she asked, although she was sure she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t meet her eyes. \u201cHave you had a chance to look through the books yet?\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhich books?\u201d But she knew exactly what he meant. His mother had hand-delivered huge binders filled with sample wedding invitations; she was supposed to study them and make her selection. She\u2019d tried to choose but every invitation she liked had been vetoed by Jacqueline or Susan. It had frustrated her so much she hadn\u2019t bothered to look again.</p><p>\u201cMom said we need to decide on the invitations right away so they can be ordered.\u201d</p><p>Alix did her best not to groan aloud. \u201cDid you look at them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m busy at the church and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m any less busy?\u201d she demanded, her anger firing to life.</p><p>Jordan met her eyes. \u201cAlix, listen, I didn\u2019t come here to argue. We\u2019re both busy, that\u2019s a given, but we need to get serious about this wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am serious.\u201d If she wasn\u2019t so tired, she would\u2019ve had more control of her temper.</p><p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s on my case about choosing the invitations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy everyone, you mean your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jacqueline,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cThen let them choose,\u201d she cried, clenching her fists in frustration. Still, Jordan was right about Jacqueline. She was so consumed with wedding details that Alix had taken to avoiding her. Every conversation with her friend and mentor revolved around some aspect of the wedding or the reception. Jacqueline had actually hired a ten-piece orchestra! Then this morning, she\u2019d said she was talking to someone about releasing doves at some meaningful point in the ceremony. Doves? As far as Alix was concerned, the idea of white birds flapping their wings, leaving droppings in their wake, was simply ridiculous. There\u2019d even been talk of a horse-drawn buggy to transport \u201cthe bridal couple\u201d from the church to the country club. The last she\u2019d heard, it was still under consideration. A buggy! She could hardly bear to think about the flowers and the cake.</p><p>Alix didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings but this was her wedding and it seemed she should have at least a little say about the kind of event it was. Against her better judgment, she\u2019d given in on this country club reception, because she knew a big reception would please Jordan\u2019s mother. Alix hoped to have a good relationship with her in-laws, especially Susan Turner, so she\u2019d been willing to compromise. Except that it felt as if she was the only one doing any compromising.</p><p>\u201cWe can go through the sample books this evening.\u201d Alix finally said. It was pointless to argue.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem too happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She might be conceding but she wasn\u2019t willing to pretend. \u201cYou know what I thought?\u201d she asked, growing a bit sad that their wedding had slipped away from her.</p><p>\u201cYou were looking forward to some time for the two of us tonight. We\u2019ll have that, Alix, I promise, as soon as we pick out the invitations.\u201d Jordan sipped his coffee.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t just that,\u201d she said wistfully. \u201cWhen you gave me the engagement ring and we started talking about the ceremony...\u201d She paused. \u201cI thought it would be a small service and I\u2019d make the invitations myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jordan seemed impressed. \u201cMaybe we could do it together.\u201d</p><p>She doubted it. \u201cHow many people on your mother\u2019s list?\u201d she asked. Needless to say, her own would be considerably shorter.</p><p>\u201cThree hundred at last count.\u201d</p><p>Alix\u2019s heart rate went into overdrive. \u201cThree hundred people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvitations,\u201d he corrected, apparently unaware of what this news had done to her. \u201cThat means maybe five hundred people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be joking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlix, my father is a pastor. You wouldn\u2019t believe how many friends and associates my parents have. Mom\u2019s whittled the list down to three hundred invitations. If I told you how many she started out with, you\u2019d have a panic attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having one now.\u201d</p><p>Jordan grinned, clearly thinking she\u2019d made a joke; she hadn\u2019t. The idea of walking down the aisle in a church filled with hundreds of wedding guests\u2014all of them strangers\u2014was enough to make Alix sick to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI hope you realize how much I love you,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Jordan grinned again as he reached for his coffee. \u201cI sure do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan we talk about something other than the wedding?\u201d she asked. The inside of her elbow was beginning to itch and she suspected she was breaking out in hives. She hadn\u2019t experienced hives since she was a kid and assumed she\u2019d outgrown the tendency, which she\u2019d learned to associate with stress. Obviously not.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he agreed readily. \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d A few minutes ago she\u2019d had a dozen different things she\u2019d looked forward to discussing with Jordan. All of a sudden her mind was completely blank. \u201cI went to the first knitting class for the prayer shawl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about the other people in the class,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only two other women. Susannah and Colette.\u201d Alix enjoyed having a smaller class. She\u2019d helped Lydia teach Susannah, who\u2019d had some of the same problems Alix did when she\u2019d started knitting.</p><p>\u201cSusannah, from Susannah\u2019s Garden?\u201d</p><p>Alix stiffened. \u201cI suppose your mother\u2019s upset because I haven\u2019t decided on the flowers yet?\u201d</p> <p>Jordan blew out an exasperated sigh. \u201cAlix, we weren\u2019t going to talk about the wedding, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Actually that was a relief. It seemed there was always something she needed to be doing or should have done with regard to the wedding.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so you\u2019re knitting a prayer shawl.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cLydia gave us a bit of the background on prayer shawls. Some church groups apparently take them to nursing homes and use them as part of their ministry. Lydia said the whole idea came about as a way of nurturing and caring for family or friends who\u2019ve got health problems. I don\u2019t think the recipient necessarily has to be ill, though. The shawls are...small displays of love,\u201d she said on a burst of inspiration.</p><p>Jordan smiled in approval.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take your suggestion and knit mine for your grandma Turner.\u201d Right away she could see that Jordan was pleased.</p> <p>\u201cAlix, she\u2019ll adore you for that.\u201d His brown eyes were soft with appreciation. \u201cYou made quite an impression on her, you know.\u201d</p><p>Alix had begun to think of Sarah Turner as her honorary grandma. She couldn\u2019t remember having grandparents of her own, although she must have. At any rate, neither her maternal nor paternal grandparents had played a role in her life. If they had, she might not have ended up in foster care.</p><p>She\u2019d never spent time around elderly people, so meeting Jordan\u2019s grandmother had been an experience. Grandma liked to talk and Alix had found her fascinating. Everyone in the family had heard Grandma\u2019s stories, but not Alix and she hung on every word. Grandma talked about the Depression and World War II, when she\u2019d worked as a school secretary for twenty-five cents an hour. Later, when her husband was in the army overseas, Grandma Turner had gone to work at the shipyard in Portland, Oregon, as a welder and saved five thousand dollars. At the time, that amount of money was a fortune. With her savings they were able to purchase the property on Star Lake, near Seattle, where she lived to this very day. The Turners had raised their two sons there; she\u2019d been a widow nearly twenty years.</p><p>Jordan reached for Alix\u2019s hand and entwined their fingers. \u201cHow about if we splurge and go to a movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPopcorn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He smiled and Alix leaned close to give him a lingering kiss.</p><p>They left soon afterward, stopping at Alix\u2019s place just long enough for her to change clothes. She\u2019d been tired and cranky when Jordan arrived, but no more.</p><p>Date night with her fianc\u00e9 was exactly what Alix needed to lift her spirits and take her mind off the fuss everyone was making over their wedding.</p> <p>Her irritation was a symptom of nerves, she realized. By the time of the wedding, she\u2019d be past all of that and eager to settle into married life. It would be a piece of cake. Wedding cake! And she was baking her own. On that, Alix wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>A few weeks ago, she\u2019d tried to convince Jordan to elope. Now she understood how foolish that idea had been. Susan Turner would never forgive her if they got married in secrecy.</p><p>When they were back from the movie\u2014a romantic comedy Alix had chosen\u2014Jordan reminded her that they couldn\u2019t put the invitations off any longer. They sat side by side at her kitchen table in the Donovans\u2019 guesthouse and flipped through the huge three-ring binders, hoping to make a selection. Some of the invitations were elaborate and eye-catching, but those didn\u2019t suit Alix\u2019s taste in the least. She thought others were far too frilly and Jordan agreed. And some were just...silly. She couldn\u2019t imagine who\u2019d want Donald and Daisy Duck on a wedding invitation. The simpler examples seemed too plain. In the end, after going through each binder twice, Alix couldn\u2019t find a single one she liked that would pass muster with Jacqueline and Susan Turner.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cI wish I had time to make them myself.\u201d Alix had looked forward to that. Something elegant, individual...</p><p>\u201cI wish you did, too,\u201d Jordan murmured, his head close to hers.</p><p>\u201cYou decide,\u201d she told him tiredly. \u201cJust pick one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, either.\u201d She didn\u2019t want Jordan to think she wasn\u2019t interested, because she was. But her choices weren\u2019t acceptable to Susan and Jacqueline\u2014Wedding Planners run amok, she thought with a sudden grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to tell my mother?\u201d Jordan asked. He sounded a bit desperate.</p><p>Unable to stop herself, Alix grinned again. Apparently she wasn\u2019t the only one afraid to stand up to Susan Turner. Well, that wasn\u2019t entirely fair. Susan was his mother and wanted the best for them. The Turner family had put their very heart\u2014and their bank account\u2014into this wedding, and the Donovans had, as well.</p><p>\u201cI know what we\u2019ll do,\u201d Alix said, feeling inspired. \u201cI have a solution!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jordan asked eagerly.</p><p>Alix laughed and threw her arms around him. \u201cChoose one,\u201d she insisted. \u201cAny one will do. Close your eyes if you want.\u201d</p><p>Giving her a puzzled glance, he opened the first binder and turned a few pages. He pointed to one of the more elaborate designs.</p><p>Alix wrinkled her nose.</p><p>\u201cThat one, then,\u201d he said, pointing to one on the opposite page.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you choose,\u201d he said.</p><p>She picked out an invitation with Disney characters.</p><p>Jordan grimaced. \u201cThat one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about this?\u201d She purposely picked out one she knew Jordan would object to.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She beamed him a smile. \u201cWe can\u2019t decide and we can\u2019t compromise, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...maybe we could?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d she reiterated pointedly.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he echoed. \u201cThat means...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means we\u2019ll have to let your mother and Jacqueline decide for us.\u201d The wedding was really for Susan and Jacqueline anyway, Alix reasoned. This way they\u2019d be able to choose the invitations they wanted...and they could do it with Alix and Jordan\u2019s blessing.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Colette Blake</p><p>Colette woke from a warm and comfortable sleep, dreaming of Christian Dempsey. Alarmed, she opened her eyes, trying to banish his image from her mind. She\u2019d worked hard to avoid any thought of him. And yet she\u2019d forever be reminded of him through their child. Again, she felt torn, wanting to tell him about the baby, and realizing she couldn\u2019t....</p><p>Countless times, she\u2019d gone over their last meeting, when he\u2019d shocked her by coming to Susannah\u2019s Garden. The day she walked away from Dempsey Imports, she was convinced she\u2019d never see Christian again. She\u2019d never wanted to see him again. She\u2019d been appalled and angry at what he\u2019d done. But the weeks since then had blunted her outrage; unaccountably she found herself making excuses for him, trying to invent reasons for such immoral, illegal activities. Maybe he had a misguided sense of compassion, she told herself hopefully; maybe his intentions were actually good. Maybe he was helping people find a better way of life....</p><p>She shook her head, dispelling that idea, and got ready for work, dressing in loose jeans and a red cable-knit sweater. With her morning tea, she knit another row of the prayer shawl. The knitting was going well, and Colette was beginning to look at yarn in a different way. After only one lesson, she was already thinking about patterns she might one day attempt. Her next project, she decided, would be a sweater for the baby.</p><p>The day before, Lydia had shown her a new shipment of alpaca wool as expensive as it was lovely. Recalling it now, Colette immediately pictured that yarn in a cardigan, a man\u2019s sweater, and Christian Dempsey flashed into her mind. Irritated, she abruptly set aside her knitting. She had to stop thinking about him! He wasn\u2019t the man she\u2019d believed he was, and the sooner she accepted that, the better. Again and again, she mentally reviewed the computer file she\u2019d read. There could be no other explanation.</p><p>Susannah was at the flower shop when Colette got in and they worked together until noon. March had arrived the day before, and typical of late winter in the Pacific Northwest, one rainstorm had followed another all week long. Then\u2014a thrilling surprise\u2014the clouds parted and the sun peeked out, bathing Puget Sound in golden, glorious light. All at once, Colette felt an urgent need to get outside and breathe fresh air.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll go for a walk,\u201d she said when Susannah returned from her lunch break. After nothing but drizzle for two weeks, Colette craved the sun on her face.</p><p>Taking her jacket in case the weather turned nasty again, she headed down the hill to the Seattle waterfront and the Pike Place Market. She loved the market and often used to shop there with Derek, although he\u2019d never found the same pleasure in being downtown as she did.</p><p>With the sun out, the city had surged to life. There was a new sense of energy, of well-being, and Colette felt invigorated. People seemed to move more quickly, laugh more loudly. She giggled at the antics of a troop of uniformed schoolkids, whose teachers merely smiled in resignation. Purchasing a decaf latte she sipped it while she wandered toward the market.</p><p>\u201cColette!\u201d</p><p>At the sound of her name, she turned but didn\u2019t see anyone familiar. After a moment, she gave up and continued into the market. Fishmongers tossed whole salmon back and forth, to the delight of tourists. She stopped to watch; it was a scene she\u2019d witnessed any number of times but always enjoyed.</p><p>\u201cColette?\u201d</p><p>Again she turned, and this time she caught sight of a man wearing a black overcoat. At first she didn\u2019t recognize him. When she did, she came to a halt, an astonished smile on her face. \u201cSteve?\u201d she said as he hurried toward her. \u201cSteve Grisham!\u201d</p><p>He stood directly in front of her and for a minute or two, all they did was stare at each other.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou moved and\u2014\u201d</p><p>They started speaking at once, then paused and laughed.</p><p>Steve motioned to Colette. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s you,\u201d she said, hardly knowing where to begin. Steve had been a good friend of Derek\u2019s, his first partner when Derek had joined the Seattle Police Department. The more experienced officer had been paired with her husband during Derek\u2019s initial two years on the force. Then Steve had been assigned elsewhere and eventually he\u2019d made detective. Derek and Colette had attended a party his wife, Jeanine, had organized to celebrate his promotion.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Steve asked, his eyes serious as he studied her. His hands rested lightly on her upper arms, as if he wanted to hug her but wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d respond.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she told him, and at that moment it was true.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here in the market...now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>When they realized they were holding up foot traffic in the narrow passageway between the stalls, they started walking together, leaving the market entirely and wandering down Post Alley.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my lunch break,\u201d she explained, dumping her empty latte container in a trash can. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSame thing. I came down to grab a quick bite. Join me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like the company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d He led her to a small hole-in-the-wall restaurant where the ambiance left much to be desired but the food was known to be exceptional. It was a police favorite, a place Colette had occasionally met Derek for lunch. Once or twice, Jeanine had come, too. Colette felt the predictable twinge of nostalgia but resolutely ignored it.</p><p>The last time she\u2019d seen Steve was at Derek\u2019s funeral. With so many people in attendance, she hadn\u2019t been able to acknowledge and speak to everyone. She\u2019d seen Steve and Jeanine but hadn\u2019t done anything more than thank them for their love and support.</p><p>\u201cI tried to call you,\u201d Steve said after the waiter had taken their order. \u201cYou changed your phone number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI moved and...well, there didn\u2019t seem to be any reason to get a phone. All I really need is my cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sold the house?\u201d Steve asked in surprise.</p> <p>\u201cThe very first day it was on the market. It went so fast I didn\u2019t have time for second thoughts.\u201d She suspected Steve had tried to contact her on the one-year anniversary of Derek\u2019s death.</p><p>He nodded as if he understood her need to move on.</p><p>\u201cI tried to reach you at work, too,\u201d he said next.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d She was astonished he\u2019d gone to such lengths to search for her.</p><p>But before she could question him further, their food arrived. Colette had ordered soup and Steve a hamburger and fries.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see how things were going,\u201d he said, squeezing a liberal amount of ketchup on the side of his plate. \u201cIt\u2019s been a year now, right?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer the question. \u201cI\u2019m doing okay,\u201d she assured him a second time.</p><p>He raised his head. \u201cYou look great,\u201d he said with an appreciative grin.</p> <p>His scrutiny unsettled her and in an effort to hide her uneasiness, she picked up her spoon. The beef soup was homemade and full of vegetables and pieces of seasoned meat. It was so hot, steam rose from the bowl.</p><p>His expression sobered. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d heard about me and Jeanine,\u201d he said, grabbing the burger with both hands.</p><p>Colette hoped he wasn\u2019t about to tell her they\u2019d split up. Colette had always liked Steve\u2019s wife and saw them as a good match, with Steve\u2019s practical nature balanced by Jeanine\u2019s whimsy and sense of humor.</p><p>\u201cJeanine filed for divorce,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cShe moved to Yakima before Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Saddened at the news, Colette set her spoon aside. \u201cOh, Steve, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d The couple had two little girls who were going to grow up without their dad.</p><p>His eyes revealed a depth of sadness as he finished chewing. \u201cWe both tried, but it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are the girls holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey seem to be doing well\u2014very well, considering,\u201d he said. After a brief hesitation he shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re so young and with the crazy hours I work, I was hardly ever around anyway.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d been with Derek, they\u2019d worked swing shift, but she supposed a detective had to be available around the clock. Still, family should always come first. In her view, anyway. \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d she asked, thinking she might be able to help but with no idea how.</p><p>That sad look returned and he lowered his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too late for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe divorce is final this week. And like I said, Jeanine moved to Yakima\u2014to be closer to her parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hated to see them leave Seattle but in the end it\u2019s probably for the best. Our parenting plan spells out my visitation rights and I have them for two weeks every summer, spring break and a week at Christmas. Jeanine\u2019s family really loves the girls, and all in all, it\u2019s a workable solution. Although I miss my family....\u201d</p><p>Reaching across the booth, Colette touched his forearm. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said again.</p><p>Steve nodded. \u201cSo am I. Being a cop\u2019s wife isn\u2019t easy. You know that. I always admired the open, honest relationship you had with Derek. That\u2019s one reason I was hoping to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Not sure what to say, Colette glanced down. \u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou were a good wife.\u201d</p><p>Her throat thickened with grief\u2014and guilt, because it was Christian who dominated her thoughts these days, not Derek.</p><p>\u201cColette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, plucking a napkin from the canister on the table.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She lifted her head in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI know this must come out of the blue, but would it be all right if I phoned you sometime?\u201d Steve said quickly.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Colette felt flustered and uncertain. \u201cSure, I...guess.\u201d This wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected him to ask. It\u2019d been years since she\u2019d dated. That was obviously true for Steve, as well; he looked as uncomfortable as she did. If they were to start seeing each other, she\u2019d have to tell him about the pregnancy. And yet, it seemed wrong for Steve to know and not Christian.</p><p>Suddenly he smiled and she saw him as the attractive man he was\u2014not just Derek\u2019s friend and one of a social foursome. His features were classic with a square jaw that suggested he could be stubborn, as well as determined. His dark brown eyes were perhaps a bit small and slightly close together, but that didn\u2019t bother her. His hair was thick and well-groomed. He\u2019d always looked good in a uniform and even more so in a suit. He exuded an authority that people instinctively respected. She remembered Derek\u2019s saying that Steve had spent time in the marines.</p><p>\u201cAre you doing anything this evening?\u201d he asked, then laughed gruffly. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to rush you. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been lonely, and I like the idea of having someone to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ve got a book club meeting this evening.\u201d She considered skipping it but Anne Marie, the bookstore manager, had asked her to attend. This was the first session, so Colette felt obliged to keep her word.</p><p>Steve seemed disappointed. \u201cOkay, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could join us if you\u2019d like,\u201d she added, not wanting to discourage him. \u201cI doubt everyone\u2019s read the book, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019d be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019d be fine,\u201d she said, warming to the idea. This wouldn\u2019t be a real date. They\u2019d be around other people, and conversation would focus on the story, not on them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember you as a reader,\u201d he commented, going back to his burger. \u201cJeanine always had a book in her hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to read quite a bit. After Derek died I couldn\u2019t for the longest time. No matter how gripping the story, my attention wandered. It was all I could do to scan the newspaper and do the crossword puzzle.\u201d In an entire year, she hadn\u2019t finished a single puzzle. \u201cBut now, thanks to this book, I\u2019m reading again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s different about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess the story strikes close to home for me. It\u2019s about a widow adjusting to life without her husband. The title is Good Grief, and it\u2019s by a writer named Lolly Winston. It\u2019s very moving and surprisingly funny, and I really enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>Colette had met the bookstore manager, who\u2019d recommended the book, by accident. Anne Marie had been walking Baxter, her Yorkshire terrier, and the tiny dog had gotten his leash wrapped around Colette\u2019s ankles. When Anne Marie learned that Colette lived above the yarn store, she\u2019d invited her over for tea. Her own apartment was above Blossom Street Books; in other words, they were neighbors. Colette liked Anne Marie and had agreed to join the discussion group, especially after she\u2019d read the book.</p><p>\u201cGood Grief,\u201d Steve repeated.</p><p>\u201cI identified with how the widow felt. At one point she goes to work in her pajamas and housecoat. I laughed out loud and at the same time I was weeping because...well, there were days like that for me, too, especially at first.\u201d</p><p>Steve nodded and was about to speak when his cell phone rang. He automatically reached for it and snapped it open. \u201cGrisham,\u201d he said in a terse voice, instantly the professional.</p><p>Colette ate a little more of her soup but after the latte her appetite was gone. She really should be getting back to the shop; she was already five minutes late and still had a brisk walk ahead of her.</p><p>Steve closed the cell and clipped it back to his waistband. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d She picked up her purse.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019d better take a rain check on tonight,\u201d he said and slid out of the booth. \u201cWork intrudes.\u201d He scooped up the tab and headed over to the cashier.</p><p>Colette found a pen at the counter and wrote out her cell number on a napkin, then handed it to him.</p><p>He smiled and thanked her. Colette went back to Susannah\u2019s Garden in a good mood. The clouds had lifted in more ways than one and she felt as if her life was finally taking shape.</p><p>That euphoric sensation didn\u2019t last long, however. When she walked into the shop, the first person she saw was Christian Dempsey, drumming his fingers on the counter.</p><p>Colette felt her heart plummet. She could hear Susannah on the phone in the back room\u2014which meant there was no one to rescue her. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to order flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA special occasion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. They\u2019re for a woman.\u201d</p><p>Colette should\u2019ve guessed. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t do it by phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to order them in person.\u201d</p><p>She understood his intent. He wanted her to know he was seeing someone else now. Fine. Message received. In her opinion, he was acting both vindictive and immature. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd while I was here, I thought I\u2019d see how you were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d she returned stiffly. \u201cActually, I have a date myself.\u201d She found herself stretching the truth, but Steve had asked her out, and even if it wasn\u2019t possible that evening, she would eventually be seeing him.</p><p>Her blatant attempt to discourage Christian didn\u2019t seem to be working. \u201cWith whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but he\u2019s an old friend of my husband\u2019s.\u201d She turned her back to him and removed her jacket.</p> <p>His smile had vanished when she turned around. \u201cDoes this so-called friend have a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he has a name.

Fudge and smudge until it fits!\u201d</p><p>Joyce Renee Wyatt, designer and instructor</p><p>Lydia Goetz</p><p>B rad and I invited Matt and Margaret over for dinner on the first Sunday in March. It was my husband\u2019s suggestion and I\u2019m grateful he thought of it. After Julia\u2019s attack, Margaret still wasn\u2019t the same. Julia herself was back in school but refused to talk about what had happened, even to her mother. It was as if a giant boulder had crashed through the roof; everyone had to walk around it and pretend it wasn\u2019t there. At any hint or mention of the carjacking, Julia disappeared into her room, plugged her iPod into her ears and zoned out for hours on end.</p> <p>I knew this couldn\u2019t be healthy and I was afraid Margaret\u2019s response wasn\u2019t, either. My sister wanted revenge and she wanted it badly enough to hound the authorities day and night.</p><p>I\u2019d hoped that an evening out with Brad and me would help my sister put aside her anger, at least for a few hours. Every day she arrived at work tense and angry, snapping at me without provocation. Just that week, I\u2019d asked her a simple question about an order I\u2019d had her place for circular knitting needles and she\u2019d yelled at me, saying she was a responsible adult and I\u2019d made her feel like a child. I hardly knew how to respond to the unreasonableness of her attack. Thankfully, no customers were in the shop at the time.</p><p>Brad and I spent the afternoon shopping and then cooking. We make a good team on the domestic front\u2014and in every other way. My husband\u2019s a master at the barbecue, and we decided to grill chicken. I made a batch of potato salad, following a recipe Tammie Lee Donovan had given me. It has jalape\u00f1o in the mayonnaise, which provides a little kick. In addition to the potato salad, I doctored up baked beans with brown sugar and mustard and baked a carrot cake for dessert. It\u2019s Cody\u2019s favorite.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was still too early in the year to bring out the picnic table, so we planned to eat indoors. Our goal was a carefree, festive evening in the hope that Margaret and Matt would relax and enjoy themselves.</p><p>Brad had everything under control by the time my sister and her husband arrived. Although I see Margaret almost every day, I was shocked by her appearance when she stepped into the house that afternoon. Outside the familiar environment of A Good Yarn, I suddenly realized how haggard Margaret looked. She\u2019s physically bigger than I am, a good four to five inches taller than my five-foot-two height and sturdily built. Compared to this nightmare with Julia, so little has truly frightened her over the years. Even when Matt was unemployed for months she kept it hidden from me. For all I knew at the time, everything was perfectly fine at home. Only when they were about to lose their house did she reveal that anything was wrong.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the case now. The dark circles under Margaret\u2019s eyes betrayed her inability to sleep. She\u2019d lost weight, too, and her pants hung loose around her waist.</p><p>After hanging up their coats, I hugged Margaret. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you could make it.\u201d</p><p>Matt glanced in Margaret\u2019s direction, and I had the feeling that at the last minute, she\u2019d wanted to cancel. I don\u2019t know how he managed to change her mind, but I was relieved he had.</p> <p>\u201cThe chicken\u2019s on the grill,\u201d Brad said, shaking hands with Matt and hugging Margaret. I loved him all the more for the warm way he welcomed my family. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what Lydia\u2019s been making, but she\u2019s been in the kitchen most of the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d I teased and we shared a smile because he knew very well what I was making.</p><p>\u201cHow about a beer?\u201d Brad offered Matt and the two men disappeared onto the back patio while I got a bottle of chardonnay from the refrigerator for Margaret and me. Cody was with a friend for the day and wouldn\u2019t be back until later. After investigating who was at the door, Chase, Cody\u2019s golden retriever, had returned to his bed in Cody\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d Margaret asked.</p><p>\u201cYou could set the table.\u201d I had the plates, napkins, silverware and glasses ready. All Margaret had to do was carry them to the table and arrange each place setting.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I called home first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>She excused herself and hurried into the other room. I could hear her talking to Julia, her tone anxious as she checked on her daughter\u2019s safety. Were the doors locked? she asked. The windows? Had she turned the oven off? Julia must\u2019ve hated having her mother constantly standing guard over her, and yet I\u2019m not sure I wouldn\u2019t have done exactly the same thing.</p><p>Margaret returned to the kitchen, where I was busy transferring everything to serving dishes and setting them in the middle of the table. \u201cHow\u2019s Mom?\u201d she asked as she carefully folded the napkins. This was her attempt at avoiding questions about Julia.</p><p>Margaret had only seen our mother a couple of times since the attack. \u201cShe seems fine,\u201d I told her.</p><p>My sister gazed sightlessly into the living room. \u201cI miss her.\u201d</p><p>Initially I didn\u2019t understand what she meant. How could Margaret miss our mother when all she had to do was drive over to the assisted living complex? They\u2019d always been close. Even now, they talked at least once a day. After we\u2019d first moved Mom, Margaret stopped by the complex as often as twice daily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like we don\u2019t have a mother anymore, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Margaret said sadly.</p><p>A sense of loss came over me. The role reversal had occurred so gradually, I was hardly aware of it while it was happening. All at once, Margaret and I were taking care of Mom. We had, in effect, become the parents, weighing decisions, dealing with financial matters and driving her to doctor\u2019s appointments. This situation had begun in earnest a year ago, when we discovered Mom was severely diabetic and needed to be on insulin. Lately, she\u2019d slipped mentally. The medication she was on no longer seemed to be working.</p><p>\u201cMom will always be our mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Margaret said and cast me an irritated glance. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I can\u2019t talk to her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can,\u201d I challenged. Mom thrived on routinely hearing from us.</p><p>\u201cNot about this.\u201d</p><p>This, of course, was the attack on Julia. I forgave Margaret for her hot-tempered response when I understood what she meant.</p><p>\u201cI miss my mother,\u201d Margaret repeated.</p><p>I agreed. I missed Mom, too. Missed those special times we\u2019d spent talking about anything and everything. I\u2019d grown to rely on her insights about the store and my customers. But when I was a teenager, Mom had been so deathly afraid of my cancer that she\u2019d forced my father to oversee all medical matters. My father was the one who\u2019d chauffeured me to countless appointments and argued with doctors on my behalf. He\u2019d sat by my bedside before and after my surgeries and whispered encouragement when the pain was more than I could bear. He was there when I suffered the debilitating effects of chemotherapy and buoyed my spirits every way he could. We grew exceptionally close, and in that, we\u2019d excluded Margaret and our mother. True, Mom did her best for me, but my father was my anchor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to tell her about Julia,\u201d Margaret continued. \u201cBut...I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>What my sister wanted, of course, was our mother back the way she used to be. She wanted Mom to promise her that everything would be all right, that this nightmare would soon be over and life would return to normal. She sought assurance that the attack wouldn\u2019t have a lasting effect on her daughter. She wanted Mom to tell her that Julia would be able to sleep through the night again and smile and laugh as though she hadn\u2019t a care in the world. Margaret wanted peace, the kind of peace only a mother can give a hurting child, the peace she longed to offer her own daughter.</p><p>\u201cChicken\u2019s done,\u201d Brad said, coming in from the patio. It\u2019d started to rain, which was no real surprise, since it\u2019d been raining off and on all weekend. The chicken breasts smelled tangy and enticing. Brad had marinated them in a mixture of soy sauce, Italian salad dressing and herbs\u2014a blend he could probably never duplicate again.</p><p>We all gathered around the table and after Brad had offered a simple grace, I passed the serving dishes around.</p><p>Matt dug into the meal with gusto. \u201cThis is great,\u201d he said between bites. He helped himself to a second scoop of potato salad before he\u2019d finished his original serving.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been doing much cooking lately,\u201d Margaret confessed, looking a little embarrassed at the way her husband kept commenting on the food.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been busy,\u201d I said, dismissing her remark.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s driving the police nuts,\u201d Matt said.</p><p>Margaret glared across the table at him. I caught Brad\u2019s eye and we exchanged an exasperated grimace. We\u2019d hoped to avoid exactly this conversation. Margaret had gone into the dining room twice during dinner to use her cell phone. I knew she was checking on Julia again. Most likely it wasn\u2019t only the police Margaret was annoying.</p><p>\u201cI thought we weren\u2019t going to mention the attack,\u201d she said pointedly to her husband.</p><p>I noticed that Margaret had barely touched her meal.</p><p>Matt sighed, sounding genuinely regretful. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>Now that Matt had brought it up, though, Margaret was loath to drop the subject. \u201cThe police don\u2019t even seem to be trying. To the authorities, it\u2019s not that big a deal. They aren\u2019t taking it seriously.\u201d</p><p>Matt raised his hand. \u201cNow, Margaret\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me, Matt,\u201d she said, interrupting him. \u201cI\u2019m the one dealing with the police, and I\u2019m telling you right now, what happened to Julia is being swept under the rug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould anyone like coffee?\u201d I asked in a blatant attempt to redirect the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love some,\u201d Brad said quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCoffee, Margaret?\u201d I leaned over to touch her arm.</p><p>Margaret nodded impatiently. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the number of times I\u2019ve talked with Detective Johnson,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThe man\u2019s an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargaret,\u201d Matt said softly, in an effort to deflect her.</p><p>My sister sighed deeply. I could tell she was trying not to ruin the evening. I also knew that Julia\u2019s ordeal was constantly on her mind.</p> <p>Margaret had made it her mission to see justice done\u2014more than justice, vengeance. The man responsible for hurting her daughter should be strung up, in her view, and left hanging in a public square. That sounds medieval, but it wasn\u2019t much of an exaggeration. If he was ever arrested and brought to court, she\u2019d sit through every minute of his trial and cheer when a guilty verdict was read. I was just as outraged as she was, but I didn\u2019t have the same passion for revenge. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I wanted this man found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Margaret wanted that, too. But she also wanted him to suffer for what he\u2019d done to Julia. She was obsessed with it.</p><p>I hurried to the kitchen to start a pot of decaf, and while it brewed, we managed to finish the meal without any further mention of the incident. It didn\u2019t come up again until we sat in the living room with our coffee and dessert.</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone know the name of a good private investigator?\u201d Margaret asked unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cWhatever for?\u201d Matt demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Margaret lashed out. \u201cThe police aren\u2019t doing a damn thing. I want to hire someone who will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMargaret...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Margaret me,\u201d she cried, pinching her lips together in a way that told me she was determined to see this through. \u201cDo you want this...this bastard to strike again? Next time, the victim might not be so fortunate. Julia\u2019s arm was broken, but if she hadn\u2019t rolled away, she could\u2019ve been hit by an oncoming car. We\u2019re both aware that our daughter could have easily been maimed for life or killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she wasn\u2019t,\u201d Matt said gently, patiently.</p><p>\u201cThe next victim might not be so fortunate, did you think of that? This man needs to pay for his crimes and be prevented from ever doing it again. And if the police aren\u2019t going to see to that, then I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of the police to find him, not some investigator we hire. We\u2019re already paying taxes to support law enforcement. Give them a chance first.\u201d</p><p>Margaret\u2019s response was a derisive snort.</p> <p>\u201cMore coffee anyone?\u201d I asked, hoping to divert an argument.</p><p>Both Matt and Margaret shook their heads, and Brad and I shared another glance. Thankfully, Cody got home a few minutes later, bursting into the house with his usual enthusiasm. Chase bolted into the living room eager to greet his master, tail wagging madly.</p><p>\u201cCan I have some cake?\u201d Cody asked, looking at the empty dessert plates\u2014and at Matt, who was eating a second piece.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have for dinner?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Cody paused to think about it. \u201cRoast beef with potatoes and gravy, peas and salad. Mrs. Martin\u2019s a good cook. Not as good as you, though.\u201d</p><p>That boy certainly had a way with words. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do about that cake,\u201d I promised, not bothering to hide a smile.</p><p>Margaret stood and Matt finished off the last bite of his dessert before joining her.</p><p>\u201cWe should be getting home,\u201d Margaret said. \u201cI don\u2019t like being away from the girls for so long.\u201d</p> <p>Matt looked as though he wanted to comment but apparently changed his mind. \u201cLydia, Brad, we can\u2019t thank you enough for dinner. It was delicious.\u201d</p><p>My sister had already reached for her raincoat and purse and seemed anxious to be on her way. I\u2019d lost count of the number of times she\u2019d phoned home, and I wondered if she thought no one had noticed. Or maybe she simply didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Brad and I walked them to the door and stood on the front porch while they dashed through the rain to their car, which was parked at the curb. With the insurance money, Matt and Margaret had purchased a replacement car. This one was used and about as plain as they come. Margaret had no intention of risking a repeat of Julia\u2019s experience.</p><p>After they drove off, Brad heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cHow do you think it went?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not as well as I\u2019d hoped,\u201d I admitted, leaning against him. He brought his arm around my waist.</p><p>\u201cMatt said Margaret\u2019s up till all hours of the night, obsessing over this. She can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither can Julia.\u201d I wanted to hug my precious niece and reassure her. I only wished I had the words to comfort her and Margaret, too.</p><p>\u201cDo you figure Margaret was serious about hiring a private investigator?\u201d Brad asked as we went back inside. He closed the front door and turned the lock.</p><p>Before I could answer, Cody came into the living room, overhearing the end of our conversation. \u201cWhat\u2019s a private investigator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a private detective,\u201d I explained.</p><p>\u201cCan I be one when I grow up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d I said, ruff ling his hair. He wrapped his arms around my waist and grinned up at me. I hugged him back. I could hardly imagine how I\u2019d feel if anyone hurt Cody. The thought filled me with such apprehension and sudden fear, I found myself holding on too tightly. I wanted to stand between him and the world, keep him safe from all harm.</p><p>Those were the same emotions my sister was feeling. After the attack on Julia, Margaret must have felt she\u2019d somehow failed as a mother.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>Alix Townsend</p><p>Alix stepped out from the bridal shop\u2019s dressing room and stood before Tammie Lee Donovan, waiting for her reaction.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t disappointed.</p><p>\u201cOh, Alix! It\u2019s perfect, just perfect,\u201d Tammie Lee sighed. She covered her mouth with both hands and when she looked up at Alix, her eyes were tender.</p><p>Alix loved this dress. She\u2019d picked it out shortly after Jordan had given her the engagement ring. The minute she saw the white gown with its simple, elegant design, she\u2019d known this was the dress for her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to get mushy over,\u201d she said a bit more brusquely than she\u2019d intended. Tammie Lee sometimes flustered her. Jacqueline\u2019s daughter-in-law was one of her best friends, which was why Alix had asked Tammie Lee to be her matron of honor. What unnerved her was how the other woman\u2019s emotions simmered so close to the surface. Tears came with the slightest provocation. Tammie Lee possessed an earthy kind of honesty, another reason Alix liked her so much. Besides, it was pure pleasure listening to her speak. Tammie Lee\u2019s words sounded like they\u2019d been dipped in honey. Alix had read that somewhere, and it described her own feelings exactly. But while Tammie Lee had a genuine sweetness, there was nothing cloying or false about her.</p><p>Tammie Lee was someone she could trust. And because Alix didn\u2019t want Jacqueline anywhere near her wedding dress, she\u2019d invited Tammie Lee to accompany her to this fitting.</p><p>\u201cI hated the idea of a dress with a lot of lace and fancy detail,\u201d Alix said, finally daring to look at her ref lection in the mirror. The white silk dress had cap sleeves, and a row of seed pearls sewn along the neckline and the hem. It cost more than she wanted to think about, but this was one expense she was picking up all on her own. From the moment she\u2019d quit smoking, Alix had put her cigarette money aside for an extravagance, and this wedding dress was it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get over the transformation\u2014from tough girl to...to Audrey Hepburn,\u201d Tammie Lee said, wiping her eyes with a tissue. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a beautiful, beautiful bride.\u201d</p><p>Despite herself Alix blushed. She hadn\u2019t thought there was any comment that could possibly bring a flush to her cheeks, least of all a compliment. Alix stared at her ref lection. She wanted to be beautiful\u2014for Jordan. And she wished with all her heart that she could be the virgin bride Jordan deserved. Her past was nothing she felt proud of. She\u2019d never been in love before Jordan, and the sexual encounters she\u2019d indulged in during her days on the street had been meaningless. Tawdry and desperate, without joy or affection. In fact, they\u2019d meant so little to her, she couldn\u2019t even recall names or faces.</p><p>She\u2019d told Jordan everything. She\u2019d told him because he had a right to the truth. He\u2019d listened and then assured her that everything she\u2019d done was in the past and forgiven. Christ and His grace had made her whiter than snow\u2014those were the words he\u2019d used, and they\u2019d given her great comfort. In confessing her sins to her husband-to-be, Alix had taken a tremendous risk. But he\u2019d proved himself that day, proved his love.</p><p>As Tammie Lee continued to praise the dress, the seamstress arrived with a pin cushion attached to her wrist and a tape measure draped around her neck. She instructed Alix to stand on a raised platform, then quickly and expertly pinned the skirt hem.</p><p>Afterward, Alix was reluctant to change back into her T-shirt, jeans and combat boots. Wearing this wedding gown, she could believe that her wedding was going to be as perfect as the dress itself. She reminded herself that all the stress and worry associated with the ceremony\u2014and the reception\u2014would soon fade. It was just one day, as Jordan kept saying.</p><p>\u201cDid I ever tell you about my cousin Savannah O\u2019Brien-Jones?\u201d Tammie Lee asked unexpectedly when Alix emerged from the dressing room.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember if you did or not,\u201d Alix said. Tammie Lee was famous for her stories. Whenever she wanted to make a point, she did so in the form of a story.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my aunt Frieda\u2019s youngest sister\u2019s girl. She grew up in New Orleans and was about as cherished as an only child can be. Then she went away to college and fell in love with a boy from Knoxville. It was as if her mother, my aunt Freida\u2019s\u2014well, I already told you how we\u2019re related. Anyway, it was as if my aunt Dorothea had been waiting her whole life for this wedding.\u201d</p><p>Alix figured that sooner or later Tammie Lee would get to the reason for this particular story. She slipped her arms into her leather jacket and zipped it up.</p><p>\u201cBig wedding, was it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, Mama told me it cost as much as a new car and we\u2019re not talking a Ford, either.\u201d Tammie Lee paused to catch her breath. \u201cSavannah had ten\u2014count \u2019em, ten\u2014wedding showers.\u201d She shuddered extravagantly. \u201cJust think about writing all those thank-you notes! Her mama spent weeks planning every detail of that wedding, and I mean every single detail. She ordered orchids from Hawaii. She went to the city\u2019s top caterer for the reception dinner. She even chose the six bridesmaids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted eight but Savannah put her foot down.\u201d</p><p>Alix and Tammie Lee left the bridal store. Shivering in the dreary March weather, they walked toward the parking garage. The wind was cold and the dark sky once again threatened rain.</p><p>\u201cIn my opinion, things would\u2019ve gone better if Savannah had spoken up sooner.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Alix was getting lost. \u201cYou mean the bridesmaids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThe wedding. It seems all she really wanted was a small wedding, and it was her mother who insisted on this huge affair that cost the earth. And her daddy. He wanted to show off his little girl.\u201d Tammie Lee paused for another breath. \u201cThe funny part is that while her parents were arranging an extravagant event, Savannah and Charlie, her fianc\u00e9, flew to Vegas and got married.\u201d</p><p>Alix gasped, and Tammie Lee broke into giggles. \u201cI\u2019d love to have been a fly on the wall when my aunt Dorothea got that phone call.\u201d</p><p>Tammie Lee wrapped her arm around Alix\u2019s. \u201cHer daddy was fit to be tied. Her mama didn\u2019t know what to do. Eventually they went ahead with the big reception, and I have to say it was absolutely lovely. Savannah and Charlie were there greeting their guests as husband and wife, and they were so happy. Oh, I get goose bumps just remembering the way they looked at each other. They were so much in love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know why she ran off to Vegas,\u201d Alix muttered. \u201cEveryone was taking control of her wedding.\u201d And she couldn\u2019t blame Tammie Lee\u2019s cousin for eloping, either.</p><p>\u201cFortunately, no one was angry with Savannah for very long,\u201d Tammie Lee went on. \u201cEveryone knew her mother had ridden roughshod over her. Of course, it helped that Savannah had her first child exactly nine months after the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re still happy and everything?\u201d Alix asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Savannah\u2019s had three children in the last five years and no one even remembers how her mother tried to take over her wedding.\u201d</p><p>Alix nodded slowly. Much as she appreciated Jacqueline\u2019s help, Jacqueline and Susan Turner had done exactly the same thing to her. It was as if her opinion no longer mattered and conferring with her was merely an afterthought. The wedding invitations were a good example. The order had been placed before Alix and Jordan had approved Jacqueline and Susan\u2019s decision. Granted, that might be a formality at this stage, but Alix would\u2019ve appreciated seeing their final choice.</p> <p>Alix grinned at her friend. \u201cAre you in the mood for one of those thick, juicy burgers we had the first time we went shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Tammie Lee said enthusiastically and they drove to a fast-food restaurant. Sitting across from her friend and wolfing down a cheeseburger, Alix suddenly understood the point Tammie Lee was trying to make.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I should be saying something to Jacqueline and Susan Turner?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Tammie Lee drawled. \u201cThat\u2019s up to you. Do you feel they\u2019ve taken over your wedding? Like Savannah\u2019s mama did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they have and even though I don\u2019t like it, I haven\u2019t stopped it, either.\u201d Being on good terms with Jordan\u2019s mother was vital; arguing over the wedding could damage their future relationship. And Jacqueline and Reese had done so much for her already, how could she complain? Alix felt trapped, stuck in a quicksand of glittery invitations and unwieldy guest lists filled with strangers.</p><p>\u201cOh, Alix, I probably shouldn\u2019t have said a word.... But I was thinking about Savannah and Charlie and how happy they were after they got back from their Vegas wedding. Oh,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI guess my mouth gets ahead of my brain sometimes. Jacqueline enjoys being part of this and she really believes she\u2019s doing a good thing. She just can\u2019t resist taking control. It\u2019s the way she is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and Reese love you like a daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the world of them, too.\u201d Love wasn\u2019t a word that came easily to her, but Alix did love the Donovans. They\u2019d done more for her than her own parents even knew how to do.</p><p>Tammie Lee took a delicate sip of her Diet Coke before she spoke again. \u201cAs I said, Jacqueline can get a bit carried away and while her intentions might be the best, I\u2019m not sure she always makes the right choices for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Alix asked wearily. \u201cWhat did she do?\u201d</p><p>Tammie Lee released a long breath. \u201cYou might want to check on your flower order,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>Alix nodded. She\u2019d chosen white daisies for her wedding bouquet. Daisies appealed to her in their utter simplicity and unpretentiousness. But when she\u2019d mentioned her choice to Jacqueline, her friend had cringed visibly and stated that roses were more traditional. The bridesmaids\u2019 flowers had been discussed, too, and Jacqueline had overruled Alix\u2019s preference there, as well. Alix had tried to insist, but apparently Jacqueline hadn\u2019t been able to accept her decision, after all.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the heads-up,\u201d Alix said. As soon as she could, she\u2019d go to Susannah\u2019s Garden and change the flower order back to white daisies.</p> <p>An hour later, Alix met Jordan on the Seattle waterfront. He was standing near the ferry dock when she joined him for their afternoon date. Because of the wedding, neither of them had extra money for frivolous things like dinners out. A movie was a rare treat these days. Since the ferry was relatively cheap, they\u2019d decided to ride it to Bremerton, where they\u2019d explore the newly renovated waterfront.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Jordan said, greeting her with a fervent hug. They attracted a bit of attention. Alix was used to that. Jordan was clean-cut in crisp jeans and a shirt with a button-down collar and a light jacket. She hadn\u2019t altered her own dress style and wore mostly jeans, black leather and of course her combat boots. The two of them looked about as different as it was possible for any two people to look. It never bothered her and apparently her fashion choices hadn\u2019t distressed him, either.</p><p>They walked onto the ferry for the early-afternoon trip, moving inside when it began to rain. Jordan purchased them each a cup of coffee, which they drank gazing out at Seattle, rapidly disappearing into the foggy distance.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d the fitting go?\u201d Jordan asked. He put his coffee on the table in front of them and held her hand.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I guess.\u201d Alix noticed a seagull flying outside the ferry window. She longed to tell Jordan how beautiful the dress was and how pretty she felt wearing it, but she didn\u2019t. The thought of talking about this made her feel shy. Like a young, inexperienced girl\u2014the virgin bride she wasn\u2019t. Instead, she drew his attention to the seagull that was keeping pace with the ferry.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to start moving your stuff over to my place?\u201d Jordan asked a moment later. They\u2019d decided his tiny apartment would be their first home.</p><p>The question surprised her. \u201cIt\u2019s a little early, don\u2019t you think?\u201d The wedding was almost three months away. They had plenty of time to arrange all that. Besides, everything she owned could be transported in a single load. Well, maybe two.</p><p>Jordan stared down at their clasped hands. \u201cI can hardly wait to be married to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d Happiness like this was foreign to Alix and sometimes it made her uncomfortable. For most of her life, happiness had been fleeting. She\u2019d learned that the minute anything good came along, someone or something would take it away from her. She still believed that. It was a bad habit she was working hard to break, this attitude of waiting for the negative, expecting it.</p><p>Jordan slid his arm around her shoulders and she nestled against him. \u201cYou know, if we saved ten percent from each of our paychecks, within a couple of years we\u2019d have enough to make a down payment on a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to buy a house?\u201d Alix asked, her head spinning at the very idea.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d He sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d she answered with a shrug. \u201cI hadn\u2019t given it any thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith our budget, the house\u2019ll have to be small. Seattle real estate\u2019s pretty pricey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lived in a house I owned,\u201d she said breathlessly. The concept was an unfamiliar one. Living in a place without a landlord who\u2019d be responsible for its care and upkeep. Not that any landlord she\u2019d ever had came around to fix whatever went wrong. Except for the Donovans, but that wasn\u2019t really a landlord-tenant relationship.</p><p>\u201cHow does that seem to you?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Actually it was better than good. It was...thrilling. Never in her whole life had Alix thought she\u2019d own a real home. Then again, she\u2019d never dreamed she\u2019d marry Jordan Turner, either.</p><p>His parents\u2019 place was provided by his father\u2019s church in the nearby town of Burien, but Jordan, as youth pastor at the Free Methodist Church off Blossom Street, only got a small housing allowance.</p><p>\u201cEventually, we\u2019re going to need more than two bedrooms,\u201d she said casually, thinking they\u2019d be having children someday. She\u2019d like two, maybe three, if Jordan agreed. She didn\u2019t have much confidence in her ability to be a mother, but she already knew that love could compensate for a lot.</p><p>Grinning, Jordan stared out over the dark green waters of Puget Sound. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking about the bedroom myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan Turner, are you talking about...dare I say the word?\u201d</p><p>Jordan chuckled. \u201cYeah, I am. S-E-X. I\u2019m a healthy, normal male who\u2019s marrying the woman he\u2019s crazy about.\u201d</p><p>Alix snuggled closer to his side. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to living with you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the beginning I\u2019ll use one of the extra bedrooms for a study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat bedrooms?\u201d Jordan seemed to forget that he lived in a bottom-level one-bedroom apartment two blocks off Blossom Street.</p><p>\u201cIn the house we\u2019re buying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, that house,\u201d Alix said, joining in his game. \u201cI\u2019ll need a big kitchen, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Will you cook for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig meals on Sunday after church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Jordan kissed her neck.</p><p>\u201cThere should be plenty of room in the backyard for the kids to run and play,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cKids?\u201d he asked, eyebrows arching.</p><p>\u201cNot right away.\u201d</p><p>Jordan closed his eyes and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m so happy, Alix. I\u2019ve never been this happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Alix was beginning to trust that her happiness with Jordan wouldn\u2019t be snatched away by a cruel or indifferent fate. It was a heady and unusual feeling, but one she could easily get used to. Wanted to get used to.</p><p>She just had to survive the wedding first.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Colette Blake</p><p>March was traditionally a slow month in the flower business; Colette remembered that from the time she\u2019d worked in her mother\u2019s shop. The Valentine\u2019s rush was over, it was too early for Easter and Mother\u2019s Day, and school proms hadn\u2019t started.</p><p>Susannah worked hard at attracting customers to the store. She ran a weekly draw that anyone could enter and on slow days, she and Colette took turns standing on Blossom Street and giving away single flowers with a tag attached that advertised the store. This week, it was green carnations in honor of St. Patrick\u2019s Day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colette enjoyed the friendly working environment, but was often at loose ends, looking for things to do around the shop. If this continued much longer, she wondered how Susannah could justify keeping her on full-time.</p><p>It\u2019d never been like that when she was with Dempsey Imports. If anything, she struggled to find enough hours for a personal life. It helped that Derek had worked swing shift; if he\u2019d been home in the evenings he would\u2019ve wanted her there, too. As it was, she often got home at eight or even later. She\u2019d loved her job, thrived on it. She hadn\u2019t realized how much she\u2019d miss it until the day she\u2019d seen Christian again. She missed being involved in such a dynamic enterprise and the challenges that came with it\u2014and she missed him. She didn\u2019t want to, hated herself for the attraction she felt, and yet no matter how hard she tried to ignore these feelings, they persisted.</p><p>Completely separate from their lovemaking was the fact that he\u2019d gotten involved in something illegal. For that reason alone, she could never go back to work for him.</p><p>Susannah, who\u2019d been in the back assembling a new-baby bouquet, joined Colette at the counter. \u201cSeeing that it\u2019s so slow, I think I\u2019ll run a few errands.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there anything you need me to do here?\u201d</p><p>Susannah shrugged. \u201cUnfortunately, no.\u201d Glancing down at her watch, she said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be more than an hour, two at the most, but I\u2019ll have my cell with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will, too.\u201d</p><p>Susannah left, using the exit that opened into the alleyway. As if they\u2019d coordinated the event, as soon as the back door closed, the front door opened\u2014and in stepped Christian Dempsey.</p> <p>Again.</p><p>At the hard look in his eyes, Colette knew. The INS had acted on the letter she\u2019d written. It was inevitable that sooner or later he\u2019d find out who\u2019d done this. Her stomach heaved with dread.</p><p>\u201cIt was you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d he said without greeting or preamble.</p><p>Colette\u2019s mouth went dry. Instinct told her to play dumb, to pretend she didn\u2019t understand what he was talking about. One glance told her he felt both angry and betrayed.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have come directly to me?\u201d he demanded when she didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Dredging up the courage to meet his eyes was difficult, but she managed. She clasped her hands behind her back to hide their trembling and shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cYou got on my computer when I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question but a statement of fact, a fact that obviously infuriated him.</p><p>Colette felt she had to explain. \u201cI needed the service code for\u2014\u201d She wasn\u2019t allowed to finish.</p><p>\u201cWho gave you my password?\u201d His eyes were like burning coals. \u201cMy computer was off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI f-found it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to believe her.</p><p>\u201cWho other than me could figure out where to look?\u201d she asked. \u201cI know just about everything there is to know about you,\u201d she said and faltered because clearly she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWho else did you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSwear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried, clenching her fists. \u201cHow dare you come at me like this! I\u2019m not the one\u2014\u201d</p><p>Again he cut her off. \u201cThat\u2019s the real reason you resigned, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She refused to answer him.</p><p>\u201cYou led me to believe it was about us and what happened at Christmas. That had nothing to do with it. That night was just a convenient excuse, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>For an instant Colette saw a flash of pain in his eyes. It was immediately replaced with resentment.</p><p>Colette had questions of her own. \u201cWhy would you risk everything like this?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>This time he was the one who refused to answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought this through a hundred times, and it makes no sense.\u201d She gestured hopelessly, lifting both hands. \u201cYou have a profitable business in a growing market. You\u2019re respected. I can\u2019t understand what would compel you to take such a huge risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t discuss this with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf not with me, then who?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou think I should trust you?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of you I spent an unpleasant morning with a roomful of attorneys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I want to know is why,\u201d she pleaded, needing some excuse, some explanation. \u201cIs it the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said,\u201d he returned pointedly, \u201cthat I can\u2019t discuss this with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you working for the INS?\u201d That was the only possible reason that might explain his behavior. Or the only possible legal reason, anyway.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, just looked at her, his gaze impassive.</p><p>Colette had so desperately wanted to believe this was the answer that she felt like crying. Instead the anger broke through. \u201cUnless you\u2019re here to place an order, I\u2019m afraid I have to ask you to leave.\u201d Rather than let him see how upset she was, she stood with her back straight, her shoulders square and her feet firmly planted. Her arms hung loosely at her sides.</p><p>After an interminable moment, Christian released a deep sigh.</p><p>She thought he\u2019d leave then, but he continued to stand there, studying her. He no longer seemed so angry, and the change in his demeanor confused her. Curious and at the same time afraid, she reached for her pad and pen as if preparing to take his order.</p><p>\u201cI asked myself over and over why you left the way you did,\u201d he said at last. \u201cBoth of us made mistakes. Both of us reacted stupidly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you know,\u201d she said, doing her best not to be swayed by emotion. Colette had her answer. He\u2019d gotten himself into a mess there was no getting out of. She couldn\u2019t be involved with him. \u201cI think you should go. And please don\u2019t come here again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even to order flowers?\u201d he challenged.</p><p>With business so slow, Colette didn\u2019t dare turn him down. \u201cPerhaps you should deal with Susannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to deal with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She poised the pen above the pad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take five dozen roses.\u201d</p><p>Five dozen? Colette wasn\u2019t sure she could even fill such a large order. \u201cWhere would you like these sent?\u201d she asked as if it was perfectly normal to have a man walk in off the street and ask for five dozen roses.</p><p>\u201cMake that ten dozen.\u201d</p><p>She found it difficult to hide her reaction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ordering flowers. You just told me I had to, otherwise you\u2019d have me evicted from the shop. I imagine you\u2019d call on your detective friend to help you do that.\u201d</p><p>Colette remembered telling Christian about Steve Grisham but she didn\u2019t recall mentioning his name or his rank. Now she regretted any reference to Steve. In fact, she hadn\u2019t heard from him since their chance encounter on the waterfront. It was just as well; any relationship was sure to be complicated.</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cI didn\u2019t threaten to kick you out,\u201d she muttered wretchedly. \u201cI just...suggested you leave.\u201d</p><p>He merely raised his eyebrows in an annoyingly superior way.</p><p>\u201cWould you like roses of any particular color?\u201d she asked, as though nothing else had been said.</p><p>\u201cRed,\u201d he responded. \u201cBlood-red. The best, most expensive roses available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll personally see that they\u2019re the best available.\u201d He was doing this purposely to hurt her. She\u2019d hurt him and he was striking back, telling her there was someone else in his life. She\u2019d been a one-night stand, and he was making sure she knew it.</p><p>He pulled a pen and pad from his briefcase and wrote something down. \u201cHave the roses delivered to this address first thing tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He handed her the slip of paper. Ms. Elizabeth Sasser, she read. The address was on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Although Colette had worked for Christian for five years, she couldn\u2019t remember his ever dating a woman named Elizabeth. But she\u2019d been gone for more than two months now.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to sign a card?\u201d she asked, keeping her voice devoid of emotion.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Colette\u2019s hand shook as she waited for him to write out the small card. He inserted it in the envelope, which he sealed, then scrawled Elizabeth across the front. Colette noticed that he\u2019d chosen one of the more romantic cards.</p><p>\u201cWill that be all?\u201d she asked, struggling to maintain a professional facade.</p><p>\u201cNo, as a matter of fact, it won\u2019t. I\u2019d like roses delivered to Elizabeth every week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what period of time?\u201d Christian went through women so quickly, she couldn\u2019t imagine anyone lasting more than a few months, four or five on the outside.</p><p>\u201cA year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year?\u201d she repeated, too stunned to keep her mouth shut. She couldn\u2019t have disguised her shock had she tried. So Christian was obviously in a serious relationship. He must be to go to this expense. As his personal assistant, Colette had ordered flowers for him dozens of times. She knew his routine; he generally ordered roses at the beginning of a relationship and again close to the end.</p><p>\u201cDoes that satisfy your demand that I do business or leave?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said curtly. She didn\u2019t know whether to feel embarrassed at the way he\u2019d outmaneuvered her\u2014or sad about the connection that no longer existed.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d she asked after an awkward moment of silence.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>His voice was almost tender, and she had the feeling this would be the last time she ever saw him. \u201cHow would you like to pay for this?\u201d she asked, working hard to keep the pain out of her voice.</p><p>He answered by withdrawing his credit card and handing it to her.</p><p>When the slip printed out, she tore it off and gave it to Christian for his signature. He didn\u2019t so much as blink at the amount, which was substantial.</p><p>\u201cTake my credit card number and bill me weekly for the roses. Make sure they\u2019re impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to them myself,\u201d she promised and wondered why she should care.</p><p>He stared at her, and she squirmed under the intensity of his gaze. \u201cI wish you\u2019d come to me before you wrote that letter,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d Once she\u2019d recognized what he was involved with, she had no option but to turn him in\u2014even if she\u2019d done it in the most cowardly possible way.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, sounding genuinely regretful.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you get out of it?\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>Slowly he shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy. I never meant it to go this far, and now there\u2019s no turning back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Christian. Can I do anything to help?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, his eyes holding hers. \u201cI know it\u2019s a ridiculous thing to ask, but would you have dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust once.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d ask. \u201cIs there any particular reason?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just that I\u2019d rather end our relationship on a positive note.

She told herself she should run away from him, run in the opposite direction, and discovered she couldn\u2019t. Even knowing that he was involved in illegal activities and likely to be arrested, she couldn\u2019t refuse him this one request.</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said reluctantly.</p><p>Colette was terrified of spending an evening with him, because of what he might say\u2014and because of what she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>\u201cIf more people knitted and crocheted, the world would see fewer wars and a whole lot less road rage.\u201d</p><p>Lily Chin, www.lilychinsignaturecollection.com</p> <p>Lydia Goetz</p><p>The prayer shawl class was going well. Susannah, in particular, was learning quickly, full of enthusiasm for knitting. Before she\u2019d even finished her first project, she\u2019d already purchased a pattern and yarn for a sweater she planned to make for her daughter, Chrissie.</p><p>Alix was a great help to me in this class. And knitting, as usual, brought its calming effect. She was more relaxed, more optimistic and I hadn\u2019t heard her say anything negative about the wedding in at least a couple of weeks.</p><p>Colette managed to learn the basic stitches, although I have to admit she didn\u2019t take to it as easily as I\u2019d hoped. It\u2019s like that sometimes with beginning knitters. Almost always, a new knitter will catch on after a few simple instructions. Soon it\u2019s as if they\u2019ve been knitting all their lives. Then there are others who struggle with each step and get discouraged when they see how slow they are compared to everyone else. In the previous class, I\u2019d explained to Colette that each person learns at his or her own pace, reminding her that it isn\u2019t a competition. I felt confident that as she continued to knit she\u2019d become more comfortable with the process.</p><p>Margaret joined the class, too. I\u2019d hoped sitting down with the others and forming new friendships would help her. And I thought concentrating on the act of knitting would soothe her, especially since she\u2019d stopped doing any handiwork at all. The attack on Julia had been more than a month ago, and my sister was still focused, to the exclusion of everything else, on finding the man responsible. I can\u2019t tell you how many times she called the police asking for an update on the case.</p><p>Some days there was no explaining her behavior. Out of the blue, she\u2019d get restless and angry and reach for the phone. The way she talked to the police embarrassed me; no matter what she said about Detective Johnson, I couldn\u2019t believe the man was a slacker.</p> <p>I\u2019d tried hard to be patient with her and while I understood how she felt, I honestly thought it would be best for Julia if my sister let go of her anger. But Margaret refused to do that, refused to rest until the man who\u2019d hurt her daughter was charged in a court of law.</p><p>The knitting class took place late on Wednesday afternoons, when Chrissie could fill in for Susannah and Colette at the flower shop. She\u2019d visited A Good Yarn recently, and I\u2019d enjoyed our conversation; Chrissie had a quick humor and wide-ranging interests. We\u2019d spoken about the resurgence of traditional women\u2019s crafts. She\u2019d chosen this as the subject for her Art History essay, and I found that exciting. Knitting was so many things, could be so many things. Including art.</p><p>That afternoon in late March, Susannah and Colette arrived together, toting their yarn and needles. They immediately sat down at the table, in the same chairs they used every class, and pulled out their projects. I noticed that Susannah was almost finished, while Colette had only about a third of hers done.</p><p>\u201cWe got the biggest flower order last week,\u201d Susannah told me, her voice shimmering with enthusiasm. \u201cA man named Christian Dempsey placed a standing order\u2014ten dozen roses, to go to the same address every Friday. For a year!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s love,\u201d I said, joking. I have a wonderful husband, but I couldn\u2019t imagine Brad ordering me one dozen roses, let alone ten. Let alone for a year.</p><p>\u201cIt really helps,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cRevenue was down for March and this new order makes a huge difference. Orders for wedding flowers are starting to come in, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrific!\u201d I was genuinely pleased for Susannah and wanted her to know that.</p><p>During our conversation Colette had remained suspiciously quiet. I smiled at her and walked over to examine her knitting. I saw that the tension in her work had loosened in the past week and praised her effort. She returned my smile and made a small joke about relaxing more. I rarely saw her outside class these days and I missed our morning chats over tea. I understood her reluctance to join me, however. Margaret made it difficult, especially now that she was in a perpetual bad mood. Right now, she was helping a customer choose yarn for a baby sweater. I could only hope her demeanor wouldn\u2019t discourage the young woman, who was new to my store.</p> <p>Alix was the last to arrive, breathless after racing across the street. \u201cI was late getting out of the kitchen,\u201d she said as she sat down in her usual chair. She took her knitting out of her backpack and set it on the table.</p><p>Now that all my students were present, I checked their work and commented on the progress Susannah and Alix had made. Everyone was doing well and I took pleasure in complimenting their efforts. Actually, the pattern\u2019s relatively easy, even for a novice knitter, and Alix, of course, was equal to the challenge of her more complicated lace shawl.</p><p>I was interested in learning who would knit a prayer shawl and why. My little group of knitters was teaching me.</p><p>I pointed out that the border was knit in a seed pattern of knit three, purl three. \u201cDoes anyone have a comment on the pattern?\u201d I asked, curious about what the women would say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet the three stitches are significant,\u201d Colette murmured as she switched the yarn from the back to the front in order to purl.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I agreed. \u201cThree is a significant number in our culture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith, hope, love,\u201d Alix stated in a thoughtful tone.</p><p>\u201cMind, body, spirit,\u201d Susannah said.</p><p>\u201cPast, present, future,\u201d Colette threw in. I wondered again if living day to day was all she could handle.</p><p>\u201cWhat about birth, life, death.\u201d This came from Margaret, who\u2019d finished with her customer. Dressed in her dark sweater, she hovered in the doorway, a gloomy and forbidding presence. It figured, of course, that she\u2019d be the one to bring up the subject of death.</p><p>I didn\u2019t meet her eyes as I circled the table. \u201cAll excellent observations,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhy knit a shawl?\u201d Margaret went on. \u201cI mean, we could be knitting anything for someone who needs a bit of TLC.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I agreed with her there. A lap robe or any of a dozen other projects would do just as well.</p><p>\u201cWhy a shawl, then?\u201d Alix asked.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWhat do the rest of you think?\u201d</p><p>Colette spoke first. \u201cWrapping a shawl around someone is a symbolic embrace. That\u2019s how it seems to me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>The others nodded.</p><p>\u201cI like what Colette said\u2014it\u2019s like a hug.\u201d Susannah sounded as if she was thinking out loud. \u201cI can\u2019t be with my mother as much as I\u2019d like, so when I mail her this shawl, it\u2019ll be like reaching out to her with an embrace, letting her know how much I love her and miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s more active than she\u2019s been in the last couple of years. Before the move, she spent hour after hour in her rocking chair, watching TV\u2014mostly the Food Channel. Since she\u2019s lived at Altamira, she\u2019s interacting with other people more and taking small trips with them. Last week she went on a garden tour and loved every minute of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Alix teased. \u201cI guess this means your mother\u2019s off her rocker.\u201d</p><p>We all laughed. I wish I could say something that positive about my own mother. But I could see she was losing ground. Every time she had another health crisis, she deteriorated a little more. With Margaret consumed by the carjacking and Julia\u2019s emotional state, we hadn\u2019t really discussed Mom. I sometimes wondered if my sister had even noticed our mother\u2019s recent decline. Still, I decided I could deal with Mom for the moment; Margaret needed to focus on her daughter. Unfortunately, Julia had refused counseling, although the doctor had recommended it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m knitting my shawl for Jordan\u2019s grandmother,\u201d Alix said. \u201cGrandma Turner is this really wonderful lady. I felt so welcomed by her. I felt like she understood me and, you know, she was just as interested in my stories as I was in hers.\u201d Alix smiled in wonder. \u201cJordan wanted me to meet her, and I was afraid she\u2019d say something about how different we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she do that?\u201d I demanded, ready and willing to defend my friend.</p><p>\u201cWho could blame her?\u201d Alix said calmly. \u201cThink about it. Jordan\u2019s going to be a pastor in his own church one day, the same as his father and grandfather. You have to admit I\u2019m not exactly a typical pastor\u2019s wife.\u201d She hesitated, biting her lip as she set her knitting in her lap. \u201cI get the feeling that his mother would\u2019ve preferred it if Jordan had fallen in love with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that!\u201d I hated that Alix thought this, and I wasn\u2019t convinced it was even true. I\u2019d met Susan Turner a couple of times. She was a knitter herself and had come by the shop for yarn and then later for a pattern book. We\u2019d talked about Alix and Jordan, but I couldn\u2019t recall anything in her attitude that indicated uncertainty toward Alix.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have brought up the subject,\u201d Alix said, splaying her fingers as if to release the tension.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the wedding bell blues,\u201d Susannah said with a laugh, but there was sympathy in her voice.</p><p>Alix picked up her knitting again. \u201cDoes anyone mind if we don\u2019t talk about the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d I assured her. I stepped behind Alix\u2019s chair and patted her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIn case anyone\u2019s wondering, I\u2019ve decided to give the shawl to my daughter Julia,\u201d Margaret said. She\u2019d joined us at the table and had begun knitting, her fingers nervous. \u201cI\u2019m hoping this will bring her solace and comfort after what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Colette asked.</p><p>\u201cHow do you expect she is?\u201d Margaret snapped. \u201cThe poor kid doesn\u2019t sleep more than three or four hours at a time. Her grades have slipped and she doesn\u2019t leave the house except to go to school. Some days she can\u2019t even manage that. And,\u201d she said with a sigh, \u201cshe won\u2019t see a counselor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I knew about Julia\u2019s reluctance to get psychological help, but the rest was news to me, and I felt dreadful. All Margaret had shared with me was her frustration with the police. My sister seemed to feel that everything would change once the perpetrator was behind bars. She seemed to believe that the situation would automatically revert to normal and Julia would be okay again. I didn\u2019t think it was going to be that simple.</p><p>\u201cFurthermore,\u201d Margaret added, with a catch in her voice, \u201cJulia won\u2019t talk about the carjacking. No one\u2019s allowed to mention anything about it. If we do, she gets up and walks out of the room. I wish now that Matt and I hadn\u2019t bought her that iPod because all she does is use it to shut us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shawl will be Julia\u2019s shelter,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cWhen she wraps it around her shoulders, she\u2019ll feel your love and prayers for her.\u201d This was my hope for my niece.</p><p>\u201cI just want her to put all this behind her like it never happened,\u201d Margaret said.</p> <p>That was what we all wanted, but I doubted it was possible.</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d had a prayer shawl after Derek\u2019s death,\u201d Colette murmured, her concentration on her knitting and the pattern on the table in front of her. She kept her head lowered so it was difficult to hear her speak. \u201cWe had a good marriage. And then...he died.\u201d</p><p>No one knew what to say to that, and an awkward silence fell.</p><p>\u201cOh, Colette,\u201d Alix said, \u201cI feel so bad that you went through such a horrible time.\u201d She shivered visibly. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what I\u2019d do if anything happened to Jordan,\u201d she went on.</p><p>Colette nodded. \u201cI hope you two will be very happy.\u201d</p> <p>Alix smiled at her. \u201cWe have our future all planned. In two years we\u2019re hoping to buy a small house. Jordan wants to turn one of the bedrooms into a study until we start our family.\u201d</p><p>She positively glowed with happiness. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9, I know, but I couldn\u2019t have described this new serenity of hers in any other way. I remembered the first day I\u2019d met her when she\u2019d walked into the store, more than a little rough around the edges. At first she\u2019d frightened me, but then I decided to treat her just as I would anyone else.</p><p>Susannah picked up the conversation by telling everyone about Joe\u2019s and her first home, a one-bedroom apartment that apparently had a ghost who flushed the toilet at odd times of the night. The mood immediately lightened as we laughed together.</p><p>I was always surprised by how quickly class time passed. It was the fastest hour of my day\u2014of my week, in fact. Margaret needed to leave early, so I told her I\u2019d close the shop alone. Brad was stopping by to pick me up on his way home. Normally we don\u2019t carpool because he has to be at work a couple of hours before I do, but he had a doctor\u2019s appointment this morning, so he drove me in.</p><p>I cuddled Whiskers before I locked up and then opened the door to Colette\u2019s apartment, knowing she enjoyed his company. For a while he traveled back and forth to the shop with me, but he\u2019s comfortable in the apartment, which was, after all, his home for nearly two years. After closing the door, I set the alarm. My fickle cat had divided his loyalties. Fortunately I\u2019m not the jealous type, at least not when it comes to my cat\u2019s affections. But my husband\u2014well, that\u2019s a different matter entirely.</p><p>\u201cHello, beautiful,\u201d he greeted me when I climbed into the front seat. \u201cHave a good day?\u201d</p> <p>Every day with Brad and Cody was a good day, and I gave him a quick kiss\u2014I had so much to thank him for. \u201cI did. How was your physical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. The doctor says I\u2019m a well man.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at his reply. \u201cMake sure you stay that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>After a brief silence I told him, \u201cI had my prayer shawl class this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as he merged with the freeway traffic. We live only about fifteen minutes from my shop.</p><p>\u201cMargaret\u2019s decided to knit her shawl for Julia,\u201d I continued. \u201cShe\u2019s so worried about her.\u201d</p><p>Brad glanced at me. \u201cIs Julia sleeping any better?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think Margaret is, either. She can\u2019t let go of this.\u201d My sister\u2019s always had an intense personality. It served her well in high school, when she excelled at sports. She\u2019s one of the most capable women I know; anything my sister set her mind to, she achieved.</p><p>Back when we were kids she was the top-rated female athlete in our school district and a star at every sport she tried. I was the sickly, puny sister everyone felt sorry for. It took Margaret and me a long time to start behaving like sisters. Sharing responsibility for our mother certainly brought us closer and so, of course, did the yarn store. I ached for Margaret now and badly wanted to help her. But Margaret was independent to a fault; in that way nothing had changed.</p><p>Last year, when Matt lost his job, she\u2019d done everything possible to hide the fact that her family was about to lose their home. I\u2019d been able to help them financially and was happy to do so, but Margaret\u2014although certainly grateful\u2014had difficulty accepting my gift.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very quiet all of a sudden,\u201d Brad said as he exited the freeway. A few minutes later, we were driving into our neighborhood.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about Margaret,\u201d I told him with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cAnything you want to discuss?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I thought about it, then shook my head. \u201cHow about you? Anything you want to talk about?\u201d I asked as we waited for the garage door to open.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, there is,\u201d Brad said. Cody dashed across the street\u2014after carefully looking both ways, just like we\u2019d taught him. One of our neighbors, a stay-at-home mother, babysat our son for an hour every afternoon after school.</p><p>Cody collected the mail, handing it to Brad as we entered the house. Chase bounded frantically around us, and Cody let him out, into our fenced backyard.</p><p>\u201cYou had something you wanted to discuss?\u201d I reminded Brad.</p><p>He lifted his head from the mail he was sorting. \u201cYou bet I did. What\u2019s for dinner?\u201d he asked with a grin. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time for lunch and your husband\u2019s one hungry guy.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Alix Townsend</p><p>S aturday was one of those hectic days that sometimes overwhelmed Alix. She\u2019d been with Jacqueline and Tammie Lee all morning, and by noon she was exhausted, although she still had a list of errands to run. Jordan would be away the entire day, taking the church youth group somewhere in eastern Washington to hear a Christian rock band. He wouldn\u2019t return until much later in the evening. Normally she accompanied him, but this time she\u2019d begged off.</p><p>She\u2019d picked up some dry cleaning for Jacqueline, bought herself toothpaste and shampoo, and dropped off her library books. Since she\u2019d always been a voracious reader, she spent an hour at the library, checking out a couple of new mysteries, a historical novel set in the Puget Sound area and a travel book about Australia. With clenched teeth she added a wedding guide to the pile.</p><p>Anne Marie from Blossom Street Books was still hosting the reading club she\u2019d started earlier in the month. The book for April was the latest thriller by Brad Metzler. Colette, who\u2019d also joined, had already finished it and offered to lend Alix her copy.</p><p>It was now midafternoon and she had yet to have lunch, so Alix decided to eat at the French Caf\u00e9, where she got an employee discount. By the time she arrived, most of the lunch crowd had left. She walked up to the counter, chatted with Julie for a minute, then ordered her favorite turkey sandwich and a cup of coffee.</p><p>As she surveyed the room, Alix caught sight of Colette Blake near the back of the caf\u00e9. Colette had brought her knitting and seemed intent on that. Alix debated whether she should say hello. During their knitting classes, Colette said very little. She seemed sad and vaguely troubled, although she was never rude or unfriendly. Alix hadn\u2019t really had much of a chance to know her; they\u2019d sort of gotten off on the wrong foot and Alix blamed herself for that.</p><p>As she approached an empty table, Colette glanced up, saw her and smiled.</p><p>\u201cMind if I join you?\u201d Alix asked impulsively.</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d Colette put her knitting down with a sigh of abject frustration. \u201cTell me again that this is supposed to be relaxing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be, in time,\u201d Alix promised, sitting across the table from her. \u201cBe patient with yourself. I lost count of how often I started my first project over. There were days I wanted to chuck the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you stuck with it,\u201d Colette murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d Knitting had proved to be a turning point in her life. Back then, she\u2019d had something to prove to herself. Refusing to quit had given Alix confidence in other areas, too. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come easy to me, either. I thought that was because I\u2019m left-handed but Lydia kept telling me knitters use both hands, so that wasn\u2019t any excuse. She said it often enough, I finally believed her. After a while, I got the hang of it. I finished the baby blanket and even knit Jordan a sweater. Okay, so the neckline turned out a bit sloppy, but he still wears it.\u201d Alix smiled, thinking of her fianc\u00e9 in that sweater. Now there was a real testament to Jordan\u2019s love. Alix had wanted to rip the whole thing out and start over, but he wouldn\u2019t let her. The yarn was ultraexpensive, too. Alix could never have afforded it on her own. Carol Girard from the class had given it to her. She\u2019d refused any compensation for it, too. That kind of generosity had been a novel experience for Alix, and she\u2019d never forgotten it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up, either,\u201d Colette said with what sounded like renewed determination.</p><p>After swallowing a mouthful of her coffee, Alix continued. \u201cI found that if I had something on my mind, it helped to sit down and knit. If I could free my mind for even a few minutes, I could sometimes settle whatever was bothering me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Colette\u2019s shoulders slumped forward. \u201cKnitting\u2019s not really helping,\u201d she said, staring down at her needles. \u201cI might as well put it aside until after tomorrow. If I have to rip out this row again, I\u2019m afraid the yarn will be completely frayed.\u201d</p><p>Alix studied Colette and saw the lines creasing her forehead. She\u2019d picked up her cup of tea and nervously clutched the delicate handle. Alix was afraid it might snap off in Colette\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening on Sunday?\u201d Alix asked. She didn\u2019t mean to pry, but perhaps if Colette talked about her problem, whatever it was, she\u2019d feel better. Alix was a good listener. Jordan had taught her the importance of sharing one\u2019s troubles\u2014and listening to those of others. Like Colette, she used to hold everything inside until it felt like she\u2019d explode if she didn\u2019t do something to get rid of all those ugly emotions.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, Alix had also learned a few things from the pastor of the church that employed Jordan, the church she now attended. Pastor Downey used lots of homespun analogies and practical advice about living in the real world. Just last Sunday, he\u2019d said that the grass wasn\u2019t greener on the other side of the fence; it was greener where it was watered. Alix liked that so much, she wrote it down on the inside flap of her Bible. She considered it good advice for a woman about to be married. It was advice she wanted to remember. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI...I\u2019m going out to dinner with my former employer,\u201d Colette explained haltingly.</p><p>\u201cIs this your first date since you lost your husband?\u201d</p><p>Colette shrugged and looked uneasy. \u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>Alix wasn\u2019t sure what that meant but didn\u2019t press for an explanation.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more a matter of who this date\u2019s with that\u2019s bothering me.\u201d</p><p>Alix nodded, encouraging her to continue.</p><p>\u201cI agreed to go and now I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d Colette stared out the window for a moment. Alix let the silence build. She\u2019d learned from Jordan not to be afraid of the silences in a conversation.</p><p>She thought Colette was about to speak when Julie, who worked weekends, delivered Alix\u2019s sandwich. Alix waited until Julie was out of earshot. She wondered why Colette would have agreed to this date when she was so clearly reluctant.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just cancel?\u201d Alix asked. Problem solved. As far as she could see, there was no reason for Colette to be so worried about this. If she didn\u2019t want to go out with the guy, she didn\u2019t have to. Women changed their minds all the time. Men, too, for that matter.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that...I don\u2019t know what to expect from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy put yourself in this situation at all?\u201d It didn\u2019t make sense to Alix.</p><p>Colette broke eye contact, lowering her head. \u201cChristian said if I went to dinner with him this one time, he\u2019d never bother me again.\u201d She spoke in a low, uninflected voice.</p><p>Alix was outraged. \u201cThat\u2019s blackmail!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuppose, nothing! You can\u2019t let a man manipulate you like that.\u201d Alix was getting worked up now. No way was a man taking advantage of Colette, not if she could help it. \u201cYou want me to deal with this loser?\u201d</p> <p>Colette smiled for the first time. \u201cThank you, but no. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow well do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked for the company for seven years, five of those as his personal assistant.\u201d</p><p>Alix frowned, a little confused by the inconsistency of Colette\u2019s reactions. \u201cIs he the reason you left?\u201d</p><p>Colette hesitated. \u201cIn a manner of speaking, yes, but it\u2019s...more complicated than that.\u201d</p><p>Alix wanted to say that life was complicated. She merely nodded, murmuring, \u201cI understand,\u201d although she didn\u2019t really.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go out with him because there\u2019s something we should discuss...I\u2019m just not sure I have the courage to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to discuss it with someone else beforehand?\u201d she asked. If Colette needed a willing ear, Alix was happy to provide it.</p> <p>Colette considered her offer for a long time before she replied. \u201cI appreciate it, but no...\u201d Her expression was sad, regretful, as if she badly needed a confidante but didn\u2019t feel ready to trust anyone just yet.</p><p>\u201cSo you haven\u2019t really dated since Derek died.\u201d Alix didn\u2019t know what else to say.</p><p>Colette shook her head. \u201cI ran into a friend of his recently. He phoned a couple of times this past week and we\u2019ve talked about getting together. Between his schedule and mine, it\u2019s difficult, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the way, I want to tell you again how sorry I am about your husband.\u201d Alix was afraid she might\u2019ve been somewhat insensitive during their conversation last Wednesday, the way she\u2019d been going on about how she couldn\u2019t bear the thought of losing Jordan when this woman\u2019s husband had died. \u201cIt\u2019s so tragic, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d Colette\u2019s mouth thinned and she bit her lower lip as if struggling not to cry.</p><p>Alix was completely confused now. \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s what people say when there\u2019s a death in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know....\u201d She grabbed her purse and scrabbled for a tissue, eventually finding one and dabbing her eyes with it. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d</p><p>Alix remained silent.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m telling you this,\u201d Colette said, digging into her purse for a fresh tissue.</p><p>\u201cListen, it\u2019s all right,\u201d Alix said. \u201cWhatever you tell me goes no further. One thing I can do is keep my trap shut. That\u2019s a lesson I learned years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Colette gave her a watery smile. \u201cI loved my husband and he was a good man. We were having fertility problems, and those problems affected our marriage. I wanted to see a specialist and Derek didn\u2019t. He said he wanted children, but if it didn\u2019t happen naturally, he was fine with letting it go. I wasn\u2019t.\u201d She paused and blew her nose. \u201cThe morning Derek fell from the roof, we\u2019d had a huge argument. He should never have gotten on that roof. He probably wouldn\u2019t have if we hadn\u2019t been fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now you feel responsible for what happened.\u201d Guilt manifested itself in so many different ways. Alix had dealt with it often enough to know the tricks it could play.</p><p>\u201cI do and I don\u2019t. I begged him to call a roofing company. Derek wouldn\u2019t hear of it. I hoped that if he cooled off and thought everything over, he\u2019d see my point about fertility treatments, so I didn\u2019t try very hard to stop him from doing the repair work himself.\u201d She shrugged in a dispirited way. \u201cHe had all these new tools he really wanted to use, too. Some of them were Christmas gifts from me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known what would happen,\u201d Alix said in a reasonable tone.</p><p>Colette nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s true. But we had this...this issue between us. I wanted a family and Derek said he did, yet he wasn\u2019t willing to take the next step to make children a possibility. I\u2019m over thirty and I didn\u2019t want to put it off any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p><p>Colette nodded again. \u201cWhat I told everyone at our last knitting class is a lie.\u201d</p><p>Alix tried to remember what Colette had said and couldn\u2019t recall.</p><p>\u201cMy marriage wasn\u2019t good anymore, even though I said it was. In fact, I was miserable and I suspect Derek was, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you would\u2019ve worked things out,\u201d Alix said and reached for her sandwich, taking the first bite.</p><p>\u201cI think we would have, too. Like I said, I loved my husband and I grieved for him when he died. I\u2019m still grieving. But Derek\u2019s gone and he isn\u2019t ever coming back. Life goes on and I have to go on, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Alix said firmly. She took another bite of her lunch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the one date,\u201d Colette said aloud, as if she needed to reassure herself. She\u2019d obviously returned to the subject of her former boss.</p><p>\u201cDo you really feel you need to go through with this?\u201d Alix asked. Something had happened there, but Colette had dropped such obscure hints that Alix couldn\u2019t figure out exactly what it was. Probably an office romance gone wrong.</p><p>Colette nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll have dinner with him, and then it\u2019ll be over, once and for all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say almost the same thing about the wedding,\u201d Alix told her half-humorously. \u201cIt\u2019s just the one day and once it\u2019s over, Jordan and I can go on with our lives. My reward is that I\u2019ll have a husband I love who loves me. If I have to stand up in front of a bunch of people I don\u2019t know, if I have to pretend to be someone I\u2019m not, then I can do that for one day.\u201d Alix had said these words to herself so many times, it sounded as if she was repeating a pledge.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished, she discovered Colette studying her. \u201cThis wedding\u2019s freaked you out, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no clue.\u201d</p><p>Her friend laughed. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d</p><p>They both smiled then.</p><p>\u201cIf you want, I can be at your place when the big bad wolf shows up,\u201d Alix offered.</p><p>Colette cringed. \u201cHe\u2019s not so bad. His name is Christian Dempsey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDempsey. Well, let me be the one to tell this Mr. Dempsey that he isn\u2019t playing fair and that you refuse to be manipulated.\u201d She\u2019d do it, too\u2014in a heartbeat\u2014and enjoy watching the man\u2019s expression.</p><p>\u201cListen, Alix, I can do this,\u201d Colette said with more confidence than she\u2019d shown before. \u201cYou\u2019re right, you know. Talking helped. I don\u2019t feel comfortable burdening Susannah with my troubles. I like Lydia a lot, and for a while we had tea together every morning, but we haven\u2019t done that lately.\u201d</p><p>Alix knew the problem there. \u201cMargaret\u2019s pretty needy these days.\u201d That was certainly an understatement.</p><p>\u201cI can understand why.\u201d Colette smoothed out her knitting and smiled at Alix. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful you came in. I feel so much better.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that buoyed Alix\u2019s spirits. \u201cI thought it was time we got to know each other.\u201d She sipped her coffee, which had grown cool.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of sandwich is that?\u201d Colette asked.</p><p>\u201cTurkey with cream cheese and cranberries.\u201d</p><p>Colette twisted around to read the menu board near the counter. \u201cI was so stressed about this dinner tomorrow that I skipped lunch and now I\u2019m ravenous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Alix said and slid the remaining half of her sandwich over to Colette. \u201cHave the rest of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>Colette picked it up and took a bite. \u201cMmm. Delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy favorite. Hey, listen. Tell me how your date with Dempsey goes, okay?\u201d</p><p>Colette raised her eyebrows. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because if he tries anything I\u2019ll break his kneecaps.\u201d</p><p>Colette laughed then, and the sound drifted through the almost-empty caf\u00e9.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>Colette Blake</p><p>As Colette waited for Christian Dempsey on Sunday evening, she tried to calm her frayed nerves by reviewing her conversation with Alix Townsend the day before. She\u2019d gotten to know Alix and to like her. After lunch, they\u2019d chatted for nearly two hours.</p><p>Her conversation with Alix had clarified her own situation. She knew most of her comments had been cryptic and yet Alix hadn\u2019t pressed her for details Colette didn\u2019t want to disclose. She could only imagine what people would think once they learned she was pregnant. But Alix wasn\u2019t judgmental in the least. If anything, she was exactly the opposite\u2014accepting, tolerant, kind.</p><p>During their conversation, Alix had opened up about her own life. Colette would never have guessed the trauma the young woman had endured, and she\u2019d found it difficult not to reveal her shock. Hearing about Alix\u2019s struggles made Colette feel close to her in a way she hadn\u2019t with anyone in years.</p><p>Colette used to think she had good friends. For the past half-dozen years, her life had revolved around her job with Dempsey Imports, and most of her time was spent with colleagues, many of whom became friends. They\u2019d replaced the friends she\u2019d had in college. And when she and Derek socialized, it\u2019d been with a completely separate group, primarily cops and their spouses. After Derek\u2019s death, their \u201ccouple friends\u201d had eventually drifted away. Later, when she resigned from Dempsey Imports, she\u2019d abandoned her work friends, afraid Christian would use them to contact her. It was a rude awakening now to realize her friends were so few. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colette wasn\u2019t angry about it, or for that matter, upset. She viewed it all as rather enlightening. Examining herself, she was forced to admit she hadn\u2019t been much of a friend and was determined to change that. Jenny was a good example. Not once since leaving Dempsey Imports had she contacted Jenny, although she\u2019d considered it from time to time\u2014usually for the wrong reasons. Jenny must wonder why she\u2019d left so abruptly and why she hadn\u2019t been in touch. That realization led her to a decision\u2014two decisions. She\u2019d give Jenny a call soon. And she\u2019d be a friend to Alix. Following their chat, she believed Alix had felt a connection to her, too. They each had their troubles, and there was no need for pretense. If Alix wanted to talk about the wedding, Colette was determined to listen.</p><p>The knock at the door leading into the alley startled her. Colette drew a calming breath, and after climbing slowly down the stairs, opened the door. Christian Dempsey stood there, looking as confident as ever.</p><p>Colette managed a smile. \u201cI see you\u2019re right on time,\u201d she said. It was a weak conversational gambit\u2014especially since Christian had never been late in his life. His days were ruled by the clock.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked brusquely.</p> <p>Colette nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll get my purse and sweater.\u201d She went back up the stairs, gathered what she needed and when she came out of the bedroom, discovered that Christian had followed her up. He stood in the middle of her tiny apartment, looking curiously around. Whiskers wandered into the room and Christian bent down to pet the cat, who purred with delight, lifting his tail and arching his back.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhiskers belongs to Lydia, the shop owner,\u201d Colette explained. \u201cShe used to live in this apartment. She left when she got married, but Whiskers considers this his home. I have the impression he\u2019s allowing me to live here.\u201d</p><p>Christian grinned as he straightened, and Whiskers wove his sleek body between Christian\u2019s legs, as if to say this man was welcome to visit anytime he pleased.</p><p>Naturally Colette chose to ignore Whiskers\u2019s warm welcome. She led Christian downstairs, and they walked through the alley to Blossom Street, where he\u2019d parked. As she\u2019d expected, he drove a fancy sports car that was low to the ground. She wasn\u2019t aware quite how low until he opened the passenger door and she tried to slip gracefully inside. Thankfully, he didn\u2019t so much as crack a smile at her less-than-elegant attempt.</p> <p>He chatted amicably about Blossom Street as he got in next to her and started the engine. Never having been terribly interested in cars, Colette couldn\u2019t have identified what kind it was; all she could say was that it made lots of noise and seemed to speed up effortlessly between red lights, until they entered the freeway. From that point forward, they whizzed past every vehicle they encountered as if all the other cars were crawling along. He didn\u2019t seem worried about a speeding ticket.</p><p>It never occurred to her to ask where they\u2019d be having dinner. When he mentioned a restaurant on the Everett waterfront, she was surprised. Everett was forty minutes to an hour from downtown Seattle, depending on traffic. They reached it in thirty-five minutes, with Christian carrying the conversation. Despite a determined effort, Colette couldn\u2019t make herself relax. She didn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d insisted on this date. And yet she owed him the truth. He deserved to know she was pregnant, and that the baby was his. That she\u2019d lied to him earlier when he\u2019d asked. All she needed now was the courage to tell him.</p><p>She knew that sooner or later, he\u2019d probably be arrested. The fact that she was responsible for alerting the law weighed heavily on her shoulders. A dozen times a day she wondered if she\u2019d made a mistake. So far, though, everything said she shouldn\u2019t trust this man.... But no matter what, she had to tell him about the baby. That was a decision she\u2019d reached during more than one sleepless night.</p><p>When they got to the restaurant in Everett, Christian parked in valet service and to her gratitude, helped her out of the car. They were escorted to a corner table for two that was both private and romantic. They were handed large leather-bound menus, and a bottle of French champagne arrived soon after that.</p><p>\u201cI hope you like champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but I only drink it when I have something to celebrate,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel I do.\u201d She decided now was as good a time as any to bring up his legal position. \u201cChristian,\u201d she said, looking intently across the table at him. \u201cI\u2019d like you to consider...\u201d She faltered slightly.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She kept her voice low for fear of anyone listening. \u201cIf at all possible, I urge you to go to the police.\u201d</p><p>Christian leaned back in his chair. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian,\u201d she said, struggling not to plead with him. \u201cYou know what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know about the letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have to realize it\u2019s only a matter of time before...there\u2019s an arrest.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged carelessly. \u201cI have an excellent attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss it.\u201d</p><p>Of course. She lowered her gaze, afraid that if she looked him in the eye he\u2019d know how deeply she cared for him. Afraid he\u2019d guess the secret she held so close to her heart. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t indicted now, you will be soon.\u201d</p><p>Again he shrugged. \u201cPerhaps. Despite your letter, I seem to have passed INS scrutiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d But she wondered if the INS knew the whole story\u2014or if he was even telling her the truth.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s the reason you agreed to have dinner with me.\u201d His smile was amused. \u201cYou thought you might convince me to give myself up.\u201d He pressed his wrists together as if they\u2019d been handcuffed. \u201cSorry to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>It was a disappointment, but she refused to let him see that. \u201cI\u2019d hoped...I thought...\u201d She couldn\u2019t finish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Colette, but I can\u2019t do what you ask.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sorry enough.</p><p>\u201cCan we still enjoy our meal?\u201d</p><p>Colette lifted her eyes to meet his and discovered a look of tenderness she hadn\u2019t expected. She wanted to believe Christian wasn\u2019t involved in smuggling other human beings, but the evidence said otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said after a long moment. As far as she was concerned, the evening was already over. She\u2019d go through the motions and even contribute to the conversation. But her desire to tell him about the baby had waned. There really wasn\u2019t any rush. He would learn about it eventually; she\u2019d tell him when she had no other option.</p><p>Christian returned his gaze to the menu, sipping from his flute of champagne while Colette ignored hers. Then he set it aside and leaned closer. \u201cAre you seeing Steve Grisham?\u201d he asked bluntly.</p><p>The question took her aback. He\u2019d said he wanted to take her to dinner so they could end their relationship on a positive note. Why would he ask about someone she\u2019d only mentioned once? Perhaps his real intent this evening was to find out exactly how much she knew\u2014and whether she\u2019d said anything to Steve.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d Colette quickly scanned the menu and decided on the grilled salmon with mango salsa.</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d he said. \u201cSince this man\u2019s associated with law enforcement, you can imagine my concern.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him quickly, not sure whether he was laughing at her.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t breathed a word of this to anyone,\u201d she said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cOther than the authorities,\u201d he interjected. He really did seem to consider it a joke.</p><p>\u201cDo you think this is amusing?\u201d she snapped. \u201cApparently so because...\u201d She swallowed hard, tugging at the linen napkin on her lap. He\u2019d committed a despicable crime and he found it funny? That disturbed her more than almost anything he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d Christian murmured.</p><p>She nodded, slightly mollified. \u201cI said nothing, I promise you. Not to anyone.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head. \u201cThank you for that.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want his thanks.</p><p>He hesitated, then added, \u201cYou really are a beautiful woman.\u201d His eyes were intense for a second or two, embarrassing her.</p><p>\u201cFlattery isn\u2019t going to change my mind, Christian,\u201d she protested. This entire conversation was disconcerting. \u201cI know the kind of man you are...now. I was fooled earlier but not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDespite what you think of me, I meant that, Colette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd.\u201d Her cheeks filled with color and she glared at him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d He raised one hand. \u201cI believe I asked if you\u2019d decided to date that friend of your husband\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I believe I said it wasn\u2019t any of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d he concurred. \u201cI\u2019m asking again anyway, and not for the reason you assume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you care?\u201d She refused to look away. \u201cAnd what legitimate reason could you possibly have for asking?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cPlease, just answer my question. Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>She could see he wouldn\u2019t drop it until she told him. \u201cSteve and I have spoken a few times,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t gone out with him, though, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but that\u2019s about to change. I\u2019ll be seeing him next week.\u201d She didn\u2019t understand why it should matter to him. Christian had gone out of his way to have roses delivered to another woman on a weekly basis, and he\u2019d made sure they came from Susannah\u2019s Garden. More than that, he\u2019d forced Colette to take the order. So he thought it was okay to flaunt his new girlfriend, but he somehow felt he could dictate who she was allowed to see!</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cBreak the date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you give me one reason why I should?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colette couldn\u2019t remain silent. \u201cI happen to genuinely like Steve Grisham,\u201d she burst out. \u201cHe was a good friend to my husband and I\u2019ve known him for years.\u201d</p><p>Christian set the menu aside. After the intense look he\u2019d sent her earlier, he now gave the impression that it was of little concern. Talk about mixed messages! He\u2019d been adamant only moments ago and now he seemed completely indifferent.</p><p>\u201cI gather you\u2019ve recently met someone yourself,\u201d she pressed, curiosity getting the better of her. \u201cThe woman you\u2019re sending all those roses.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll admit she\u2019s very special.\u201d</p><p>Colette\u2019s stomach twisted with what could only be jealousy. She didn\u2019t want to care and yet she did, more than she was willing to acknowledge. However, she kept her response light. \u201cShe must be special if you\u2019ve ordered flowers for the entire year,\u201d Colette continued. \u201cAs I recall, most of your liaisons didn\u2019t last nearly that long.\u201d</p><p>He arched his brows, and Colette grinned. \u201cYou forget I was the one who made the reservations for all your dinner dates\u2014and ordered the flowers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He cocked his head. \u201cBut you\u2019ll notice I didn\u2019t bring you to any of those restaurants.\u201d</p><p>Colette found it impossible not to smile. \u201cSo that\u2019s why we had to drive an hour outside of Seattle. You\u2019ve gone through the entire roster of fine dining establishments in all of King County.\u201d</p><p>Christian was saved from having to answer when the waiter came for their dinner order. After he\u2019d left, the subject changed and they discussed mutual acquaintances. It was common ground, and safe.</p><p>To say the meal was divine would be an understatement. Every course, from the roasted tomato soup with hot rosemary-scented rolls to the hearts-of-palm salad to her entr\u00e9e was so delicious it practically dissolved on her tongue.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t drink your champagne,\u201d Christian said as the waiter carried off their dinner plates. He gestured at the full glass that had remained untouched throughout the meal.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His expression sobered as he stared at her intently. \u201cWhy? Because being with me is nothing to celebrate? Or is there some other reason?\u201d</p><p>That comment made her flinch, but it was the perfect lead-in for what she had to tell him\u2014and she would have, had their conversation gone another way. Instead, she\u2019d learned that he was relying on attorneys to rescue him from the law. Under the circumstances, Colette didn\u2019t feel she could let him know, not right now. She had to wait, see what the next few months would bring.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to ask me if I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d she asked, smiling as though the question was patently absurd. \u201cI already gave you my answer, remember? I have no reason to lie.\u201d</p> <p>The tension visibly eased from his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHowever, if I was,\u201d she said, purposely testing him, \u201cI\u2019d certainly know your feelings on the matter, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>It was plain that talk of a pregnancy had unsettled him.</p><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s a moot point, I don\u2019t think we need to belabor it.\u201d</p><p>Colette nodded vigorously. \u201cMy feelings exactly.\u201d</p><p>He sipped from his second glass of champagne as they read the dessert menu. Everything sounded delectable, and Colette was certainly tempted, but in the end declined and ordered tea instead. Christian did the same. Soon afterward, he settled the bill and they prepared to return to Seattle.</p> <p>On the drive back, despite her best efforts to stay awake, Colette drifted off. The car was cozily warm, the ride smooth, the music soft. When he turned onto Blossom Street, she suddenly woke up, feeling disoriented for a moment. She glanced at his unyielding profile, then looked out at the familiar street.</p><p>Instead of parking on Blossom as he had earlier, Christian drove into the alley near the rear entrance to her apartment. He switched off the engine and they sat in the dark. There seemed little to say.</p><p>A feeling of sadness came over her, and she felt regret that their relationship had dwindled down to this\u2014mutually kept secrets, mutually told lies.</p><p>\u201cChristian, listen\u2014\u201d she began, but he cut her off.</p><p>\u201cBefore you say anything, I\u2019d like to make a comment, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both agree that our...liaison, for lack of a better term, should never have happened,\u201d he said. He appeared to be choosing his words deliberately.</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cand I apologize for my part in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too.\u201d Christian shouldn\u2019t assume all the responsibility for something in which she\u2019d been a willing partner. \u201cPlease, Christian, I\u2019d rather not talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I realize now is that by giving in to my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian.\u201d She placed her hand on the door handle, ready to end this uncomfortable discussion. He couldn\u2019t say anything she hadn\u2019t said to herself a hundred times. \u201cThis isn\u2019t doing either of us any good. It happened. As you said, it shouldn\u2019t have, but it did. I don\u2019t blame you and I hope you don\u2019t blame me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Then let\u2019s leave it. You said you wanted to end things on a positive note. We have. It\u2019s over. I wish it didn\u2019t have to end at all, but I can\u2019t be a party to what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I accept that.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door. \u201cThen this is goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice was a hoarse whisper.</p><p>She started to climb out of the car.</p><p>\u201cColette,\u201d he said. Stopping her, he reached for her hand. \u201cIf you need anything, please contact me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThank you, but no.\u201d</p><p>Even in the darkness she knew he was smiling. \u201cSomehow I figured you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself, Christian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. About...everything.\u201d</p><p>Christian released her hand. \u201cI meant what I said, Colette. I won\u2019t trouble you again.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, nodding slowly, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cI want only the best for you,\u201d he added.</p><p>He opened the car door, and the interior light illuminated the alley with its concrete parking spaces and winter-bare tree. He walked around to the passenger side and helped her out, his hand clasping hers a little longer and a little harder than necessary.</p><p>It looked for a moment as if he intended to kiss her. Instead, he backed away and dropped her hand. Colette fumbled inside her purse for her keys; when she glanced up, she knew with certainty that this would be the last time she\u2019d ever see Christian Dempsey.</p><p>He nodded once, then got back into the car, waiting long enough for her to unlock her door before he disappeared into the night.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>\u201c...there are no knitting police.\u201d</p><p>Stephanie Pearl-McPhee from her book Knitting Rules! Storey Publishing, 2006</p><p>Lydia Goetz</p><p>I was on my feet from the moment I walked into A Good Yarn until I flipped the lock and turned over the Closed sign at the end of a very long afternoon. We did a booming business, with thirty-eight sales. By anyone\u2019s standards, it was an excellent business day. I attributed this to the fact that it was now April, and spring had well and truly arrived.</p><p>Fortunately, Margaret seemed to be in a better mood. Although we didn\u2019t have a spare moment to discuss it, I had the feeling the police were closing in on a suspect. Margaret had said she\u2019d heard there was promising news but that was all she was able to tell me.</p><p>Toward the end of the day, we\u2019d had a couple of unexpected visitors\u2014Carol Girard and her son, Cameron. I was eager to tell Brad about Carol\u2019s news.</p><p>When I got home, Brad had already started dinner, to my relief. I\u2019d put three boneless chicken breasts in a marinade of buttermilk and ranch dressing spices that morning, and there was leftover coleslaw from the night before, plus Cody\u2019s favorite, Tater Tots.</p><p>Our son was in the backyard throwing balls around with a couple of neighborhood kids. As always, Chase was with him, barking and running after all the loose balls. The sound of Cody\u2019s excited young voice drifted toward me, and tired though I was, I felt a surge of happiness knowing that right outside this window was my son.</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetheart.\u201d I kissed Brad and he slipped an arm around me.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter, now that you\u2019re home.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAside from that, busy.\u201d</p><p>I set my purse on the kitchen counter. \u201cMine, too.\u201d Since Brad works for UPS, he has to meet a daily quota or \u201cdelivery expectation\u201d every day, which means he\u2019s constantly on the go.</p><p>I took a tray of raw cut-up vegetables and dip from the refrigerator. It was difficult to get Cody to eat vegetables and he could be downright inventive at finding reasons he shouldn\u2019t have to. When he was eight, he\u2019d announced in an earnest voice that God had personally spoken to him. When Brad asked him what divine message had been revealed, Cody had said that, according to God, he shouldn\u2019t eat any more green beans.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Brad asked, turning away from the stove.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about God telling Cody he didn\u2019t have to eat green beans.\u201d</p><p>Brad laughed out loud. \u201cGood thing the kid likes raw carrots and broccoli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect that has more to do with the dip,\u201d I said, but at least he was putting something green and orange in his mouth that didn\u2019t contain sugar.</p><p>I opened the silverware drawer and extracted what we needed for the evening meal. \u201cCarol Girard stopped in this afternoon,\u201d I said.</p><p>Carol was a good friend and one of my very first customers. When I met her, she and her husband, Doug, had been experiencing fertility problems. In an effort to reduce her stress and prepare for the IVF treatments, Carol had quit her job.</p><p>After working in a high-pressure position as an investment banker, she\u2019d discovered that staying home wasn\u2019t as easy as she\u2019d assumed. She\u2019d grown restless and bored. Carol had wandered into the yarn store during one of the lengthy walks she\u2019d started taking\u2014and when she learned the class would be knitting a baby blanket, she felt it was a sign that she\u2019d have her baby.</p><p>Their prayers were answered, but not in a way anyone had expected. She and Doug had adopted a baby boy they\u2019d named Cameron.</p><p>\u201cHow is Carol?\u201d</p><p>I looked my husband straight in the eye, grinning widely. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d A smile broke out.</p><p>I nodded. I knew what he was thinking because that very thought had gone through my mind, too. Doug and Carol had spent thousands upon thousands of dollars trying to conceive. They\u2019d finally given up on ever having a child\u2014and then they\u2019d adopted Cameron. And now...</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months sure,\u201d I told him.</p><p>As I recalled, there was no medical reason Carol couldn\u2019t conceive. It had just never happened, despite every test and procedure modern medicine could provide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet Doug\u2019s happy,\u201d Brad said. Like my own husband, Doug was one of those men who value family\u2014a natural dad.</p><p>\u201cDoug is thrilled. So\u2019s Cameron\u2014they\u2019ve told him he\u2019s going to be a big brother.\u201d The three-year-old was as excited as his parents. While they were in the yarn store, he\u2019d wanted Carol to buy a plush lamb I had on display for what he called \u201cMama\u2019s baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad for them,\u201d Brad told me. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have them over sometime soon? We\u2019ll celebrate.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I\u2019d been on an emotional high ever since I\u2019d heard the news. I knew Jacqueline and Alix would share my feelings. A new baby pattern book had arrived earlier in the week and I planned to knit a project out of it. Maybe another baby blanket. I could envision a reunion of that first knitting class in a few months. We\u2019d present Carol with hand-knit gifts to welcome this new baby.</p><p>The high lasted until later that night as I got ready for bed. I was washing my face when it hit me. Carol\u2019s pregnancy had suddenly, cruelly reminded me: I would never have a baby. The emotional punch came out of nowhere and struck with such intensity that I closed my eyes and leaned against the bathroom counter. I held my breath until the pain began to subside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brad was already in bed, sitting up against the pillows, reading. Cody had been asleep for a couple of hours. I was grateful for that, because I didn\u2019t want him to see me like this.</p><p>Brad has always been sensitive to my moods. The moment I walked into the bedroom, he knew something was wrong. He lowered his book and looked at me.</p><p>With a huge lump in my throat, I lifted the covers and climbed silently into bed.</p><p>\u201cLydia, what is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for Carol,\u201d I said in a shaking voice. \u201cBut it hit me just now.... I can\u2019t have children. I mean, I\u2019ve known all along and it isn\u2019t like it\u2019s any surprise...so I don\u2019t understand why I should feel like this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll never have a baby of our own,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWe have to accept that.\u201d</p><p>I was in my teens when I first underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatments. From the time I was sixteen, I knew my ability to conceive had been lost. I would never, under any circumstances, bear a child. Brad and I had discussed this at length before we married. I thought I had accepted it.</p><p>\u201cWe have Cody,\u201d Brad reminded me gently.</p><p>Cody was deeply important to me; I didn\u2019t need to tell Brad that. And yet, I still ached. My arms had never felt so empty. My heart hurt. For the first time, I understood with all my being the pain Carol had endured before Cameron came into her life.</p> <p>\u201cCody is as much my son as if I\u2019d given birth to him,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you never knew him as an infant.\u201d Brad was telling me he understood what I was feeling. \u201cDo you want a baby?\u201d he asked, his voice low and soothing.</p><p>I nodded, deploring the tears that filled my eyes. \u201cI want your baby.\u201d</p><p>Brad placed his arm around my shoulders and kissed the top of my head. I knew he was struggling to find the words to comfort me. Above all, I needed his assurance that he loved me despite my physical inadequacies. If he\u2019d married just about anyone else, he could have fathered a second child. It was his bad luck that he fell in love with me.</p><p>I was aware of how ridiculous I was being. I didn\u2019t care. I wanted to feel a baby\u2014our baby\u2014stretching, kicking and growing within my womb. That was denied to me because of my cancer. It was unfair and wrong and I was miserable, swallowed up in self-pity.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve been a good mother,\u201d I sobbed.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re already a great mother.\u201d Brad got out of bed and went into the bathroom, returning with several tissues.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s adopt,\u201d Brad suggested as I mopped my face.</p><p>\u201cAdopt?\u201d I repeated the word as if I\u2019d never heard it before. We\u2019d talked about it, of course, but I suppose the option had never seemed real to me.</p><p>Brad stood there waiting for a response.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to adopt?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI would if that would help you,\u201d he said. He made it sound as simple as snapping his fingers.</p><p>\u201cOh, Brad.\u201d In that moment I loved him so much. But the problem was, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted.</p><p>\u201cWe can start calling adoption agencies tomorrow morning.\u201d He seemed pleased with this solution. \u201cI do have flashes of brilliance every now and then,\u201d he murmured, getting into bed again.</p> <p>\u201cYou do,\u201d I said. With gratitude and love, I spread eager kisses over his cheeks and lips.</p><p>My husband took my face between his hands and kissed me back, each kiss growing in intensity. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean,\u201d he whispered between kisses, \u201cthat we should give up our efforts to...make a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I agreed, sliding my arms around his neck and pulling him to me.</p><p>My husband is an appreciative lover, and I felt his tenderness and his love in every cell of my body as we moved together, whispering encouragement.</p><p>Afterward, we lay spent in each other\u2019s arms. Earlier I\u2019d felt bereft, lacking as a woman. Brad had showed me I was woman enough to satisfy him, and knowing that brought me intense pleasure and pride.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d he whispered close to my ear.</p><p>\u201cBrad! How can you think about food at a time like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m famished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any cookies left.\u201d I\u2019d baked peanut butter cookies Sunday afternoon for Cody. But Brad liked them as much as Cody did and had eaten more than his share.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,\u201d he said, tossing aside the covers. He shrugged into his robe. \u201cWant one?\u201d</p><p>My first reaction was to decline, but then I changed my mind. \u201cYeah, that sounds good,\u201d I said, folding back the blankets. I found my nightgown and slipped it over my head.</p><p>By the time I joined Brad, he had the bread laid out on the countertop and was searching the cupboard for a jar of peanut butter.</p><p>\u201cNext to the stove, right-hand side,\u201d I instructed him.</p><p>While he made the sandwiches, I got out milk and poured us each a glass.</p><p>\u201cSo, should I check into adoption agencies tomorrow?\u201d Brad asked.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem convinced.\u201d He turned to look at me. \u201cWe need to be very sure about this before we apply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me think about it some more, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of questions we\u2019ll have to ask ourselves,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we both work. What about day care?\u201d</p><p>Brad unscrewed the lid on the jelly jar. \u201cMy mother watched Cody after he was born so Janice could work,\u201d he said. \u201cI can approach her about that so we won\u2019t have to worry about child care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Still, there were plenty of other questions. Like: Would we be willing to maintain a relationship with the birth mother if she wanted one? And what if the child had some inherited disease or condition\u2014could we cope with that?</p><p>\u201cI could pick her up after work,\u201d Brad was saying.</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cDid I say her?\u201d he asked, sounding surprised. \u201cI guess I just assumed you\u2019d want a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the other hand, if we have a choice, I think I\u2019d like a little girl.\u201d Brad slapped two slices of bread together and handed me the first sandwich. I reached for a plate and cut my sandwich in two. Brad ate his standing over the kitchen sink.</p><p>\u201cCody will be good with an infant,\u201d I said, picturing my stepson with a baby. \u201cBoy or girl.\u201d</p><p>Brad agreed with a quick nod. He\u2019d gobbled down his whole sandwich before I\u2019d had the chance to eat half of mine. I put the second half in the fridge and we went back to bed.</p><p>We cuddled close and I felt the even rhythm of his breathing a few minutes later and realized he\u2019d fallen asleep. It took me a while longer as I reviewed our discussion. Adoption.</p><p>Brad and I could bring an infant into our lives. I thought about how my family was likely to react. I knew it would please my mother; she\u2019d always wanted more grandchildren.</p><p>I could say with certainty that Margaret, however, would insist adoption was a mistake. After making sure I knew she disapproved, she\u2019d list ten excellent reasons why Brad and I shouldn\u2019t adopt a child. But it wasn\u2019t Margaret\u2019s life, was it? I reminded myself that the decision was ours, not my sister\u2019s.</p><p>What seemed like minutes later, the alarm on our clock radio was buzzing. The morning news followed. Brad was already out of bed and in the shower. Although I don\u2019t have to be at work until ten, I make it a habit to get up with my husband.</p><p>Yawning, I went into the kitchen, started the coffee and dropped slices of bread in the toaster. Cody, lucky boy, could sleep for another hour before he had to wake up.</p><p>\u201cHave you done any more thinking about what we discussed last night?\u201d Brad asked me as he took his first sip of coffee.</p><p>\u201cA little. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you want, Lydia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about it again in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Before he left for work, Brad kissed me with extra fervor, and I took comfort in what he told me so effectively without words. I stepped outside with him, into a spring morning soft with promise. Standing on the deck, I watched him pull out of the garage.</p><p>I must\u2019ve done something very good in my life to deserve Brad Goetz.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>Alix Townsend</p><p>With Jacqueline and Colette\u2019s encouragement, Alix joined Go Figure, an exercise gym for women, which had recently opened on Blossom Street.</p><p>Exercise, Alix heard from a variety of sources, was a good tension reliever. As the wedding date grew closer, Alix was in desperate need of something to calm her increasingly frazzled nerves. Knitting just wasn\u2019t doing it anymore, not when this farce of a wedding got more ridiculous with each passing day.</p><p>As an added inducement, Colette had signed up with her. Go Figure wasn\u2019t like any gym Alix had ever seen. It had equipment but no mirrors, except in the changing stalls, and no men.</p><p>The exercise program was predesigned and set to music. You went around the circle of exercise equipment, spending forty-five seconds on each machine, then you spent another forty-five seconds dancing or running in place on a small platform. After that, it was on to the next piece of equipment, and so on. The goal was to do thirty minutes of exercise, which meant completing the circle twice. Forty-five seconds? Anyone could manage that.</p><p>When Colette suggested they try this out, Alix had scoffed. She didn\u2019t want to brag, but she was in good shape. She hoisted twenty-five-pound bags of flour nearly every day. Mixing all that bread dough and lifting it onto a floured board wasn\u2019t for weaklings. Still, the first time she completed the cycle at Go Figure she discovered muscles she didn\u2019t know she had.</p><p>After their initial week, during which they were allowed to visit as often as they wanted for free, Colette and Alix had decided to sign up. The gym recommended three to four sessions in a seven-day period. Having an exercise partner was great encouragement. Alix felt the workout had reduced her stress and Colette appeared to be enjoying the benefits, as well.</p><p>One drawback was that they couldn\u2019t really chat. Not with the music blaring and the beat urging them on. But Alix and Colette usually found a few minutes before or after their sessions to talk.</p><p>\u201cDid he call?\u201d Alix asked when they\u2019d finished the latest round of exercise. She didn\u2019t have to explain who he was.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colette muttered. Her face was red from exertion. She draped a small towel around her neck as she moved toward the dressing room. Pushing aside the curtain, she glanced at Alix. \u201cI already told you he wouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s the way we both want it.\u201d</p><p>When Colette had first mentioned Christian, Alix had serious doubts about him. Who wouldn\u2019t? He seemed to be virtually blackmailing her into that dinner date. Something was going on between those two, something Colette hadn\u2019t told her. Based on what she\u2019d said earlier, there\u2019d obviously been an incident, maybe a disturbing one. Alix wouldn\u2019t pressure her, though. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After her dinner date with Christian Dempsey, Colette had told her a bit more. From the way she talked, Alix could only assume that Colette had fallen in love with him. But if that was the case, she didn\u2019t understand why Colette chose to avoid him.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel like walking down to Pike Place Market with me?\u201d Colette asked as Alix pulled on her jeans.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Alix\u2019s Saturday was mostly free. Her future mother-in-law wanted to meet with her later in the day to go over the menu for the rehearsal dinner. Alix felt her stomach knot at the prospect of dealing with one more wedding detail.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s mother meant well, and Alix tried hard not to say or do anything that would have a negative effect on their relationship. She did her best not to feel resentful. It\u2019s just one day had become a mantra that she repeated incessantly. The problem was that Alix wasn\u2019t willing to surrender everything. So far the only battle she\u2019d really won had been over her wedding dress. Every other decision had gone to Jacqueline and Susan, and most of the time Alix\u2019s wishes were ignored.</p> <p>In her ongoing effort to keep the peace, Alix felt she\u2019d swallowed her pride far too often. Worse, Susan and Jacqueline hardly seemed aware of her mounting frustration. So any excuse to delay the meeting with Susan was a welcome reprieve.</p><p>The morning had brightened, which improved Alix\u2019s mood. But although the sun was out now, that didn\u2019t guarantee it would stay out. Above all, April weather was unpredictable and today could end with a storm.</p><p>As they walked, Alix saw that Colette seemed more subdued than usual. She guessed that her friend was mulling over their earlier conversation.</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing Steve anytime soon?\u201d Alix asked, leading indirectly to the subject of Christian Dempsey. Colette had mentioned the Seattle policeman last week and for some reason, seemed reluctant to accept his invitation. She\u2019d talked it over with Alix. Although not generally a fan of cops, Alix couldn\u2019t see any harm in it and had urged her to go. The evening had turned out to be a success; according to Colette, Steve had been both attentive and charming. Alix wasn\u2019t fooled, though. Colette was still hung up on her old boss, regardless of how she tried to convince Alix otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI told Steve I\u2019d go to the movies with him this afternoon,\u201d she said without enthusiasm. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably have dinner afterward.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo that relationship\u2019s going well?\u201d In contrast to the one with Christian Dempsey.</p><p>\u201cYes, if it\u2019s any of your business.\u201d Colette grinned. \u201cSteve\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>Alix studied her friend. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t you jumping for joy? No, don\u2019t tell me\u2014let me guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you cut it out.\u201d Colette rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you dating this guy?\u201d Alix asked abruptly. \u201cYou like Christian.\u201d</p><p>Colette shrugged her shoulders helplessly as they waited at a red light.</p> <p>\u201cColette, you have to do what will make you happy.\u201d Alix nudged her as the light changed and they crossed the street, heading to the Hill Climb that connected the market to the Seattle waterfront.</p><p>\u201cIt would never work with Christian and me.\u201d Colette held up one hand. \u201cBefore you ask, let me say I can\u2019t tell you any more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not married, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colette muttered as they continued walking.</p><p>\u201cWas he abusive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should call him, you know.\u201d Alix couldn\u2019t see what was standing in their way.</p><p>\u201cOh, Alix, it\u2019s much too complicated to explain. I wish things were different, but they aren\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Colette picked up her speed and Alix had to work to keep pace with her. \u201cTrust me, you can\u2019t possibly say anything that\u2019s going to shock me.\u201d</p><p>Colette\u2019s steps slowed then, and she looked at Alix with questioning eyes. \u201cWhat if I told you\u2014\u201d She didn\u2019t finish.</p><p>\u201cTold me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I drank too much and spent nearly twenty-four hours in bed with him,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>Alix waited, knowing there had to be more to this story.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to say anything?\u201d Colette demanded, sounding angry now.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for someone to judge you, it won\u2019t be me,\u201d Alix returned promptly. \u201cIf you want to talk about what happened, fine, but if you expect me to beat you up over it, you\u2019ve come to the wrong person.\u201d</p><p>Colette thanked her with a solemn nod. \u201cIt was the night of the company Christmas party.\u201d Misery and guilt suffused her face. \u201cWe\u2019d both had too much to drink.\u201d</p><p>Alix gently placed her hand on Colette\u2019s elbow. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d Colette said, but she avoided meeting Alix\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably understand better than anyone else. Until then, I didn\u2019t realize how much I\u2019d come to love Christian. He was so wonderful to me after Derek died, so compassionate and generous. And working so closely together, well...I suppose it was only natural that I\u2019d fall for him. I hate to admit it. Falling for the boss is such a clich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he share your feelings?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. He\u2019s dating someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ordered flowers for her at the shop. Roses\u2014every week for a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>A short silence ensued.</p><p>\u201cEveryone makes mistakes,\u201d Alix told her. \u201cI certainly made my share. Jordan knows.\u201d It practically killed her to tell him, but she had to do it. Laying out the sordid details of her past had been the most humiliating experience of Alix\u2019s life. She felt deep shame, remorse, self-reproach and about ten other emotions too painful to name.</p><p>\u201cYou told him...everything about your past?\u201d Colette asked. Immediately she seemed to regret posing the question. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer that if you\u2019d rather not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind answering. And yeah, I did tell him the whole story.\u201d Alix lifted one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cBut I don\u2019t make a habit of revisiting that time in my life. I\u2019m an entirely different person now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil Jordan, I didn\u2019t know what to do with all the ugly baggage from my past. It dragged me down. Every time something good happened, like when Jacqueline and Reese invited me to live in their guesthouse, I kept thinking I didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Alix...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. Jordan was great.\u201d She paused, running one hand through her short, spiky hair. \u201cHe told me something I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d</p><p>Colette was staring at her intently. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that sometimes the hardest part of forgiveness is forgiving ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Colette nodded thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m not the kind of woman who does one-night stands. Or at least, that\u2019s what I used to think. I always had contempt for women who did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought I\u2019d sink as low as I did, either,\u201d Alix said and swallowed the bile that rose in the back of her throat. The ugliness of the things she\u2019d done had tainted her view of life until she\u2019d made her peace with God\u2014and with herself. \u201cAll I can say is I\u2019m not going back there again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d Colette said with utter confidence. \u201cLike you said earlier, you aren\u2019t the same person you were then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point I\u2019m trying to make,\u201d Alix said, eager to turn the mirror away from herself, \u201cis that you\u2019re doing the same thing I was. The person you can\u2019t forgive is you.\u201d</p><p>Colette agreed with a quick smile. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d This had been the most difficult aspect of her new life, and Alix wasn\u2019t sure how to explain it to her friend. \u201cThese negative reactions? You know, when you expect the worst \u2019cause it\u2019s all you deserve?\u201d When Colette nodded, she said, \u201cI call it stinking thinking.\u201d</p><p>Colette frowned. \u201cYou mean when you start rehashing the past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Alix closed her eyes. \u201cBut it\u2019s more than that. Let me give you an example. Once, Tammie Lee, Jacqueline\u2019s daughter-in-law, told me how pretty I looked in red. At the time I had on a black shirt with jeans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? She gave you a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe intended it as a compliment,\u201d Alix explained, \u201conly I didn\u2019t hear it as one. Instead I convinced myself that Tammie Lee had purposely insulted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t mean it that way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d Alix concurred. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this\u2019ll make sense to you, but it all goes back to those old messages I\u2019d gotten as a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I understand,\u201d Colette said slowly.</p><p>\u201cTammie Lee made a casual comment and what she intended as a compliment I turned into an insult. That\u2019s because those messages told me I\u2019d never been pretty so I couldn\u2019t be beautiful, no matter what color I wore. Not only that, I assumed she was saying I wasn\u2019t pretty the way I was.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cMy mother used to call me horrible names. For years I heard her voice in my head\u2014sometimes I still do, but now I know how to drown it out. Whenever I remembered her saying things like \u2018You ugly little bitch\u2019 I\u2019d sink into this dark pit of depression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alix...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the effects of not being able to forgive yourself\u2014or to cut yourself loose from those hateful insults and accusations. No matter what wonderful things people say, you don\u2019t believe them.\u201d</p><p>Colette seemed to understand.</p><p>\u201cWhy should anyone love me?\u201d Alix asked rhetorically. \u201cIf I don\u2019t care about myself, then how can Jordan or anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...In my case, it\u2019s best to leave matters between Christian and me as they are,\u201d Colette said, her voice low. \u201cThere\u2019s more I can\u2019t explain\u2014stuff that\u2019s not directly related to Christian and me. I care about him, but I can\u2019t go down the path he\u2019s chosen. I...want to help him, but I can\u2019t. I have to simply walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d Alix pressed. \u201cCan you really do that?\u201d</p><p>A long time passed before Colette answered. \u201cI really don\u2019t have any choice and yet...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet...\u201d Alix pushed gently, knowing there was something else her friend wasn\u2019t telling her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we can ever get past what happened that...night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything seems to go back to that,\u201d Alix murmured.</p><p>Colette stopped walking for a moment, looking out toward the Sound. \u201cWe didn\u2019t use birth control,\u201d she whispered and Alix watched as she swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Colette nodded, her eyes brimming with tears. \u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone...I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve really taken it in myself. Why is life like this?\u201d she groaned. \u201cDerek and I couldn\u2019t get pregnant and then...then one night with Christian and\u2014\u201d She left the rest unsaid. \u201cI haven\u2019t figured out what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019ll keep the baby, of course. Christian doesn\u2019t know...Every time I try to tell him, I realize I can\u2019t. For now, that\u2019s for the best.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut, Colette, he has a right to know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him,\u201d she promised and wiped the moisture from her cheeks. \u201cJust not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prayer shawl?\u201d Instinctively Alix knew it wasn\u2019t a shawl Colette had been knitting, but a baby blanket.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the baby,\u201d Colette said. \u201cChristian\u2019s and mine.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>Colette Blake</p><p>Colette prayed she\u2019d done the right thing in telling Alix about the pregnancy. She hadn\u2019t intended to, but it had seemed so natural.... Every day it became more difficult to conceal the news. Her instinct was still to keep the baby a secret for fear Christian would somehow discover her condition before she was ready to let him know.</p><p>Embarrassment had kept her from revealing the pregnancy to her family and her in-laws. What could she possibly say to Derek\u2019s parents? Thank goodness they lived in Chicago! At least they wouldn\u2019t find out until she chose to tell them\u2014which she would. Eventually. They were wonderful people who loved their son and loved her. Colette was their last link to Derek and they kept in touch with her. Sooner or later she\u2019d need to tell them the truth.</p><p>Then, of course, there was Christian. She expelled him forcefully from her mind. He\u2019d made his choice and she\u2019d made hers. When the time came, whenever that might be, she\u2019d break the news to him. It seemed wrong to tell others and not the baby\u2019s father; that, however, couldn\u2019t be helped.</p> <p>Discussing her pregnancy with Alix had given her a sense of exhilaration and relief. That old saying about confession being good for the soul\u2014she\u2019d certainly found it to be true.</p><p>Her high spirits had continued during her afternoon with Steve Grisham. She\u2019d enjoyed their date, yet she felt something was missing in their relationship. In the beginning she\u2019d assumed it had to do with her and the secret she kept. But after Saturday she realized there was a lack of connection between them. She liked Steve and was grateful for his company, which was pleasant and undemanding. And yet...</p><p>It surprised her that he didn\u2019t notice anything amiss. At the end of the evening he\u2019d kissed her tenderly and seemed disappointed when she didn\u2019t invite him into her apartment. He\u2019d asked to see her again and they were meeting for dinner on Friday evening.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s lovely,\u201d Susannah said, nodding at the arrangement of roses Christian had ordered for Elizabeth Sasser. As if to prove he meant absolutely nothing to her, she\u2019d worked doubly hard to make the arrangement as attractive as possible. Roses didn\u2019t need much to enhance their beauty, but she\u2019d carefully chosen a gleaming copper tub and interspersed ferns and baby\u2019s breath among the deep-red blooms.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I delivered this personally?\u201d Colette asked. She couldn\u2019t explain why she felt the need to meet the new woman in Christian\u2019s life. Elizabeth had apparently made quite an impression on him. Christian\u2019s past relationships had never lasted more than a few months, and yet he\u2019d left his credit card number and instructions for a full year of weekly flower deliveries.</p><p>Susannah blinked at the unusual request. \u201cWe have a service.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it on my own time.\u201d That would save Susannah the delivery fee.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t,\u201d Susannah returned, not bothering to conceal her surprise. \u201cIf you want to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Colette wasn\u2019t so convinced she\u2019d be thankful after she\u2019d made the delivery, though. Elizabeth was probably beautiful beyond description, talented and rich to boot. Colette\u2019s own shortcomings overwhelmed her. All she could think was that she was setting herself up to feel like a pathetic little waif, insecure and ridiculous. And yet her curiosity overrode common sense.</p><p>Then she remembered her most recent conversation with Alix. Her friend had talked about the ugly voices that shouted at her and dragged her into despair. Voices that told her she was worthless. She\u2019d referred to it as \u201cstinking thinking.\u201d Colette was hearing voices like that now. They were just as destructive as the voices Alix had mentioned. Everyone heard them at one time or another, Colette decided. She was determined not to listen.</p><p>Before she left Susannah\u2019s Garden, Colette refreshed her makeup and ran a comb through her hair. The other woman might be Hollywood beautiful, but Colette wouldn\u2019t allow that to influence her own feelings about her appearance or self-worth. Or so she repeatedly told herself as she sought out the Capitol Hill address.</p><p>When she pulled up in front of the huge three-story house\u2014actually, mansion better described the residence\u2014her confidence deflated faster than a balloon in a sticker bush. The lawn and yard were meticulously groomed. The sidewalk leading to the entrance was lined with blooming roses; their scent readily identified them as antique varieties and not hybrids. How like a man to send dozens of roses to a woman who had a yardful!</p><p>It took Colette several moments to find the courage to ring the bell. A full minute passed. Then an elderly woman, dressed in a black uniform with a white apron, opened the massive front door.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Colette said with a friendly smile. \u201cI have a flower delivery for Ms. Elizabeth Sasser.\u201d In all her life, she\u2019d never known anyone rich enough to employ a maid.</p> <p>The other woman unlatched the screen door and pushed it open, accepting the arrangement with both hands. \u201cThey\u2019re especially beautiful this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Ms. Sasser at home?\u201d Colette asked, while she still had the courage.</p><p>\u201cDoris? Who\u2019s at the door?\u201d The voice was that of an older woman.</p><p>\u201cFlowers, Miss Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d A woman in her seventies or early eighties made her way into the entry, walking slowly but without a cane. Her silver hair was piled on top of her head and she wore a light pink pantsuit with a diamond brooch pinned at the collar.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Elizabeth Sasser?\u201d Colette blurted out.</p><p>The older woman\u2019s eyes narrowed as she studied Colette. \u201cDoris, invite the young woman in for tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Miss Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take our tea in the library,\u201d she said, before turning away from the door and disappearing.</p><p>The other woman nodded. She set the copper tub of roses on a round marble-topped table that stood in the entryway.</p><p>Colette stepped inside the house and immediately noticed the scents of lemon and polished wood\u2014and roses. The floors gleamed and a wide, sweeping stairway curved toward the second floor. There were two doors off the entry, one to the left and the other to the right. She could see that the one on the right led to a formal dining room with tables and chairs and a huge sideboard.</p><p>The door on the left apparently led to the library. Built-in mahogany bookcases stretched from floor to ceiling on three sides. A marble fireplace dominated the fourth wall. Two leather chairs, creased with age, sat facing the fireplace. The room enchanted Colette, who suppressed the urge to run over and examine the leather-bound volumes that filled the bookcases.</p><p>\u201cYou may have a seat.\u201d Elizabeth Sasser gestured toward the leather chair next to her own.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Colette self-consciously sat and placed her hands in her lap. She had no idea what to say. But since Ms. Sasser had invited her, Colette decided to let the older woman ask the questions.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have tea presently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds very nice.\u201d Colette glanced down at her hands, which were clenched in her lap like those of a schoolgirl called to task. With a determined effort she forced herself to relax.</p><p>\u201cChristian sent you?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cNo...I mean, yes, in a manner of speaking. He ordered the flowers and I delivered them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>They were briefly interrupted by Doris, who carried in a tray with a china teapot, creamer and sugar, two ornate teacups with saucers and a plate of delicate French cookies. \u201cMadelines,\u201d Elizabeth pointed out when Doris had left. \u201cI\u2019m sure you recall your Proust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemembrance of Things Past,\u201d Colette said dutifully. She didn\u2019t add that she\u2019d always meant to read the books.</p><p>Elizabeth smiled faintly. \u201cI\u2019ll ask you to pour. My hands aren\u2019t as steady as they once were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to,\u201d Colette said. She went over to the library table and carefully followed the other woman\u2019s instructions about sugar and lemon. After both cups were ready, she set a cookie on each saucer and brought the first to Elizabeth. She took the second for herself and reclaimed her seat.</p><p>\u201cYou know my great-nephew?\u201d Elizabeth quickly returned to her questions.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Colette didn\u2019t elaborate, but she was pleased that the mystery of the older woman\u2019s relationship to Christian had been revealed.</p><p>Elizabeth raised the cup to her lips and sipped her tea. \u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that in previous weeks the flowers have been brought to the house by a delivery service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the service unable to make the delivery this week?\u201d</p><p>The moment of truth had arrived. Colette could easily lie and save face. Admitting that she\u2019d been curious about the woman in Christian\u2019s life would tell Elizabeth more than Colette was comfortable sharing. If she lied, she\u2019d be on her way in a matter of minutes and out of this embarrassing situation.</p><p>\u201cActually I asked to deliver the flowers,\u201d Colette murmured, deciding on the truth. \u201cI work for Susannah\u2019s Garden, the flower shop on Blossom Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there any particular reason you felt it necessary to bring them yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I wanted to meet the woman Christian loved.\u201d</p><p>A smile spread across the older woman\u2019s face. \u201cHow clever of you. Now that you recognize it\u2019s an old woman, you must be amused\u2014or disappointed? I\u2019m his great-aunt and one of his only surviving relatives.\u201d</p><p>Colette wasn\u2019t disappointed at all. If anything she was baffled. As Christian\u2019s former assistant, she was shocked to discover he had family she knew nothing about. \u201cHe\u2019s never mentioned you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d Elizabeth commented drily. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he prefers to forget he has family.\u201d</p><p>Colette frowned.</p><p>With a dismissive wave of her hand, the older woman said, \u201cIt\u2019s a long story and one better saved for another day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked with Christian for five years. I never knew he had family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive years?\u201d Elizabeth repeated. \u201cAnd in all that time he never mentioned me. I find that insulting.\u201d She made a soft huffing sound. \u201cThere are times I\u2019d like to box that young man\u2019s ears.\u201d She muttered something under her breath Colette couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cWhat about his mother?\u201d Colette asked. She didn\u2019t want to appear inquisitive or nosy, but she hungered for information. For the sake of her child it might prove important, even necessary. She\u2019d assumed his mother was dead but now she no longer knew.</p><p>\u201cThe dear girl died in childbirth when Christian was eight. A terrible loss. One doesn\u2019t hear of that often these days. Still, it happens. Elliott lost both his wife and his infant daughter. And Christian lost more than his mother, I\u2019m afraid. He lost his security.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colette\u2019s heart ached for the little boy Christian had been.</p><p>\u201cFor a year afterward, Elliott buried himself in the bottom of a whiskey bottle, too immersed in his own grief to help Christian deal with his.\u201d Elizabeth set her cup back in the saucer with a sharp clink. \u201cMy husband, God rest his soul, brought young Christian to me. Charles and I had never been blessed with a family. Unfortunately, we were of an age at which we didn\u2019t have the foggiest idea what to do with a youngster. We kept him until Elliott had straightened himself out and then sent him home to live with his father.\u201d She paused, shaking her head. \u201cI regret that to this day.\u201d</p><p>Colette tried to picture Christian as a hurting, motherless little boy but couldn\u2019t. He seemed too self-possessed, too confident, too remote. Perhaps his childhood explained the unyielding exterior he presented to the world.</p><p>Only three times in all the years she\u2019d known him had Christian revealed a different facet of his personality. The day of Derek\u2019s funeral, the night of the Christmas party and just recently, when they\u2019d gone to dinner.</p> <p>\u201cDid his father ever remarry?\u201d she asked, wanting to know more details of Christian\u2019s young life.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, no. When he finished with alcohol, Elliott buried himself in his work. He traded one addiction for another, although arguably a less destructive one. Christian was raised by a series of housekeepers. I sent for him every summer and at Christmas, but as you can imagine, neither Charles nor I knew how to entertain a young boy.\u201d</p><p>Colette smiled, picturing Christian sitting at that huge dining table for a formal meal.</p><p>\u201cI did teach him to play bridge, and I\u2019ll admit he\u2019s quite good.\u201d</p><p>Colette had never heard that he played any form of cards.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, his relationship with Elliott is strained. My nephew decided long ago that Christian would one day take over his investment firm. Christian\u2019s never shown the slightest interest in stocks and bonds. From the time he was a child, he loved to travel. Christian spent hours in this very library, studying maps and reading about faraway lands. He started the import business with an inheritance he collected from his mother\u2019s side of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very successful at the business,\u201d Colette said, and wondered anew why he\u2019d put so much at risk.</p><p>\u201cAnd an utter failure at personal relationships, much like his father. Elliott blamed the world for his loss and instead of getting on with life, he held his bitterness inside. I\u2019m afraid Christian is more like his father than he realizes. He, too, keeps everything hidden. He refuses to get close to anyone.\u201d Elizabeth shook her head sadly.</p><p>\u201cHe...he seems to have plenty of women friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPieces of fluff,\u201d Elizabeth said scornfully. \u201cThey never last long, do they? He woos them and then grows bored with them. Am I correct?\u201d</p><p>Colette felt as if she was telling tales out of school. \u201cUh, that was his pattern when I worked with him. But I haven\u2019t been with Dempsey Imports for the last four months, so I can\u2019t say about more recent...relationships.\u201d</p> <p>The other woman put down her tea cup and studied Colette. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Colette felt the blood rush to her face. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that....\u201d</p><p>The old woman gestured with one elegant hand. \u201cDon\u2019t bother to deny it. You wouldn\u2019t have come here otherwise. Stand up,\u201d she demanded. \u201cI want to get a good look at you.\u201d</p><p>Haltingly, Colette complied, thankful for her loose-fitting clothes.</p><p>\u201cStraighten your shoulders,\u201d Elizabeth snapped. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with young people these days? It\u2019s a wonder you don\u2019t all come down with back problems.\u201d</p><p>Colette managed to restrain a smile.</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d Elizabeth announced abruptly.</p><p>This time Colette did smile. \u201cI like you, too. Do you mind if I sit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d Elizabeth nodded. \u201cAll I can say is that it\u2019s high time my great-nephew settled down. I was beginning to wonder if he had the brains God gave a goose.\u201d</p><p>Colette wanted to laugh at Elizabeth\u2019s disgusted tone.</p><p>\u201cCan you stay for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t necessary. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth cut her off with an imperious wave. Before Colette could stop her, she\u2019d called for Doris, instructing the housekeeper to set another place at the table.</p><p>\u201cOver dinner, tell me everything you know about Christian. I haven\u2019t seen the boy in months and I\u2019m starving for news of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cElliott and Christian are my only living relatives,\u201d Elizabeth said before Colette could attempt an answer. \u201cOne day this house will be his.\u201d As she looked around, her gaze fell lovingly on the things in the room\u2014the books, the antique desk, the rich Oriental carpet. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you right now, if he marries one of those...those girls he\u2019s been dallying with for the last few years, I\u2019d rather donate my home to the zoo. As I said, it\u2019s time he settled down and married a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure I qualify as one,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>The older woman\u2019s gaze narrowed and she appeared to carefully choose her words. \u201cYou\u2019ll do. Now, tell me about yourself.\u201d</p><p>Colette paused and was about to describe her own family when Elizabeth raised a hand.</p><p>\u201cBefore you get started, I\u2019d like you to answer one question. It might be an uncomfortable one and I apologize for that in advance. Nevertheless, I insist on the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Colette hoped it wasn\u2019t the question she feared most.</p><p>Elizabeth leaned forward and stared at Colette intently. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious you love the boy. Something\u2019s gone wrong. What?\u201d \u201cI...\u201d \u201cThe truth,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Colette clasped her hands and nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>The older woman sighed. \u201cMy dear, dear girl, love is always complicated. It wouldn\u2019t be love unless it was.\u201d</p><p>Colette agreed with a silent nod.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Colette\u2019s eyes widened and then instantly flooded with tears.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>\u201cI love capturing the beauty and movement of a dog in intarsia knitting. It\u2019s fun to use a colorful palette of yarns, to knit a sweater that shows not only the splendor of the breed but its owner\u2019s love and pride.\u201d</p><p>Peggy Gaffney, www.kanineknits.com</p><p>Lydia Goetz</p><p>F riday started off well. Sales were steady, and I saw some of my favorite customers.</p><p>At home the night before, Brad and I had spent hours discussing adoption, weighing the pros and cons.</p><p>My biggest fear, and one I shared with Brad, was the future. It was one thing to open a yarn store; if the cancer returned, I could always sell out. Bringing a child into our lives was another story entirely. As much as I lived in hope and health, the threat of the disease always hung over me and I couldn\u2019t ignore that and neither could Brad.</p><p>By the end of the evening, we were still of two minds, but I felt closer to him than ever. We decided to set the question of adoption aside for the moment.</p><p>Friday morning, I noticed an improvement in Margaret\u2019s attitude. I assumed this had come about because of Thursday\u2019s conversation with Detective Johnson. It seemed likely that the suspect they\u2019d been watching would soon be picked up. Margaret was in a state of excitement all day, and I felt so pleased for her. Pleased and relieved. Yes, by all means, I wanted this lunatic found, charged and sent to jail. Even more, I wanted this matter shelved for Julia\u2019s sake. And my sister\u2019s.</p><p>The yarn store was doing well financially and I felt such a strong connection with my customers, especially the women in my prayer shawl class. I\u2019d noticed that Colette and Alix had become friends. That shouldn\u2019t have surprised me, and yet it did. I wouldn\u2019t have thought they had much in common. But then, Alix is probably one of the most complex people I\u2019ve ever met. She\u2019s able to adjust to people and situations easily\u2014except for that out-of-control wedding. Still, she was doing her best to cope because she loves Jacqueline.</p><p>Who would\u2019ve believed Jacqueline Donovan and Alix would become so close? That was a shocker. I think the world of Jacqueline and Reese for the way they helped Alix, helped and encouraged her through her schooling and as a bride-to-be.</p><p>When Paul, their only son, married Tammie Lee, Jacqueline wasn\u2019t involved in the wedding. At one time there were hard feelings because of this. Now, of course, that\u2019s all water under the proverbial bridge. With Alix\u2019s wedding, however, it was as if Jacqueline was making up for lost time\u2014and lost opportunities. She was planning the social event of the year. I had to hand it to Alix; she\u2019d been patient and good-natured about the whole thing.</p><p>At about four o\u2019clock, the phone rang, and because I was standing closest to the cash register I automatically reached for it. \u201cA Good Yarn,\u201d I said into the receiver.</p><p>\u201cAunt Lydia?\u201d It was Hailey, my niece and Margaret\u2019s youngest daughter.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say my name,\u201d Hailey pleaded. She was whispering. \u201cIs my mother there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my mom watching you? She doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s me on the phone, does she?\u201d</p><p>This was a very odd conversation, and it was beginning to alarm me. \u201cShe\u2019s with a customer,\u201d I said, lowering my own voice. Margaret apparently wasn\u2019t listening, since she didn\u2019t acknowledge the comment. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know what to do. Julia\u2019s crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know,\u201d Hailey said, and she seemed close to tears herself. \u201cNo one\u2019s here and...and Julia\u2019s talking crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, crazy?\u201d I asked urgently.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t want to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d I hesitated for a moment. \u201cLet me talk to Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The relief in Hailey\u2019s voice was evident. \u201cI\u2019ll take the phone to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in her room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s on the kitchen floor,\u201d Hailey said.</p><p>As soon as she walked into the kitchen, chatting as she went, I could hear Julia\u2019s heart-wrenching sobs. Crying like this wasn\u2019t normal, and the sound sent shivers through me.</p><p>The customer left and Margaret looked at me. I tried not to reveal that I was talking to her daughter.</p><p>\u201cHold on a minute,\u201d I said to Hailey.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I held the phone away from my ear and glanced at Margaret, who\u2019d gone into the office to retrieve her purse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to run over to the French Caf\u00e9 for a latte,\u201d my sister told me. \u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThanks anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be more than ten minutes,\u201d Margaret said on her way out the door, blissfully unaware of what was happening in her own home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>The bell above the door jingled as she left and Whiskers, my lazy cat, raised his head, then stretched his well-fed body in the warm afternoon sun.</p><p>As soon as Margaret was gone, I went back to the conversation. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said to Hailey, \u201cput your sister on the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. Julia, talk to Aunt Lydia,\u201d Hailey said.</p> <p>\u201cJulia,\u201d I said softly, trying to encourage her. \u201cSweetie, tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>She hiccuped a couple of sobs. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t stop crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened?\u201d I asked, thinking something must have happened to trigger this emotional breakdown.</p><p>\u201cYes...I can\u2019t sleep. I try and try.\u201d</p><p>Margaret had told me how poorly Julia had been sleeping after the incident. The carjacking had taken place more than two months ago and I\u2019d thought Julia was doing better. Apparently not.</p> <p>\u201cHave you talked to anyone?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word was accompanied by a sob.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she screamed, anger taking control. \u201cI want to forget. Why did he have to pick me? I hate him...I hate him.\u201d She sobbed again, harder this time, almost wailing. \u201cWhy won\u2019t everyone just leave me alone? It\u2019s all anyone wants to talk about. I can\u2019t stand my life...I don\u2019t want to live anymore.\u201d</p><p>Now I understood why Hailey was so frightened. \u201cSweetheart, don\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>Julia must have tossed the phone away, because I heard a loud clang and soon afterward Hailey was on the line again. \u201cShe\u2019s still crying, only now she\u2019s got her face on the floor.\u201d</p> <p>Julia screamed an obscenity that made me blink a couple of times.</p><p>Hailey gasped. \u201cWhat should I do, Aunt Lydia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better tell your mother about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan she come home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Julia might not want to see Margaret, but it was evident to me that she needed to talk to someone, perhaps a counselor or her doctor.</p><p>A few minutes later, after I\u2019d reassured Hailey as well as I could, Margaret returned. \u201cAlix was working as the barista,\u201d Margaret told me, grinning. It\u2019d been such a long time since I\u2019d seen my sister this carefree that I hated having to tell her about Julia.</p><p>\u201cThat was Hailey on the phone,\u201d I said.</p><p>The animation immediately left her face. \u201cIs everything all right with Julia?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cI think she\u2019s having some kind of breakdown.\u201d</p><p>The color drained out of Margaret\u2019s face. The reprieve was over. She tensed and for a moment seemed rooted to the spot, frozen with indecision about what she should do.</p><p>\u201cShe needs you,\u201d I told her. \u201cShe\u2019s talking nonsense.\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell her Julia was talking about not wanting to live anymore. It terrified me that she\u2019d even suggested...</p><p>Margaret stared into the distance.</p><p>\u201cGo home and call me once you\u2019re there so I know everything\u2019s okay. Leave now, Margaret.\u201d</p><p>My sister nodded.</p><p>I went to her then and hugged her. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d I assured her and I prayed that was true.</p><p>Margaret left. As soon as I saw her drive away, I wished I\u2019d closed the shop and gone with her. I wasn\u2019t sure it was a good idea to let her deal with this by herself.</p><p>An eternity passed before the phone rang again. When I picked up, it was Hailey. I didn\u2019t recognize her voice at first because she was crying so hard. \u201cMy mom and dad are here,\u201d she sobbed into the phone. \u201cThey decided to take Julia to the hospital. Daddy thinks Julia needs professional help.\u201d</p><p>A hard lump formed in my throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming over,\u201d I told Hailey.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t want me to go with them and I don\u2019t want to be here by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d I\u2019d never just left the shop like this. Even when Margaret and I learned that our mother had been found unconscious at home, Jacqueline had been here to take over.</p><p>After reassuring Hailey, I called Brad on his cell and told him what had happened. He confirmed that I should put a note on the door, lock up and leave right away. I promised to phone him as soon as I had any news.</p><p>I don\u2019t even remember getting in my car and driving to Matt and Margaret\u2019s house. The minute I pulled up in front and parked, the door banged open and Hailey raced down the steps and hurled herself into my arms, sobbing.</p><p>Holding her tightly, I stroked her hair. I noticed two neighbors watching us, and knowing what a private person my sister is, I kissed the top of Hailey\u2019s head and steered her back toward the house.</p><p>Once inside, she got herself a tissue and blew her nose loudly.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what set Julia off?\u201d I asked, wondering why this had happened now.</p><p>Hailey shook her head.</p><p>I put on water to make tea. Tea always seemed to calm me and I hoped it would help my niece, too.</p><p>\u201cMom tried to talk to Julia. She said the man\u2019s going to be caught and the police are making an arrest soon.\u201d</p><p>That was the same news Margaret had given me. \u201cDid that make any difference?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hailey stared up at me with tearful eyes. \u201cJulia just kept crying. She tried to stop. I could tell she wanted to, but she couldn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s like...like she\u2019s kept everything inside and then it all just broke loose.\u201d She bit her lip and looked as if she might start weeping again herself.</p><p>The tea kettle whistled and I immediately tended to it. I poured the boiling water into a ceramic pot that had once belonged to our mother and added plenty of sugar to our cups, thinking the events of the afternoon warranted it.</p><p>\u201cTell me exactly what happened,\u201d I said, carrying our tea to the table and sitting down next to Hailey.</p><p>My niece frowned, as though trying to remember the details. \u201cJulia was home before me and I could see she\u2019d been crying.\u201d She gestured at the tissues scattered about the kitchen. \u201cI asked her if everything was okay, and she said...she said she wanted to die.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it; I swallowed a gasp just hearing those words again.</p><p>\u201cJulia said...she said everyone looks at her. That\u2019s not true, Aunt Lydia! No one looks at her any different than they did before\u2014she just thinks they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I wondered if there\u2019d been any other signs of trouble since the carjacking.</p><p>\u201cWhen Mom got here, Julia started talking about dying again and Mom phoned Dad. When he got here, he said we had to get Julia to a hospital.\u201d She sipped her tea and sucked in a wobbly breath as she made a determined effort to hold in her emotions. \u201cJulia scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI think she might\u2019ve done it...She might\u2019ve actually killed herself. She looked so desperate and I think...I think she really meant it. That\u2019s why I called the shop. I was so glad when you answered. I...I\u2014\u201d She shook her head, unable to go on.</p><p>\u201cYou did the right thing,\u201d I said, trying to comfort her.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She held the mug with both hands. \u201cIt isn\u2019t right that a strange man could hurt Julia like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>\u201cHe broke her arm, but he did more than that. He broke her spirit, too\u2014that\u2019s what my dad says,\u201d she told me in a solemn voice. \u201cJulia isn\u2019t the same person she used to be. I hardly know her anymore.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d seen a change in Julia, too, and I was with her a whole lot less than her family. When it happened, the attack had seemed terrible enough. But I\u2019d had no idea how far-reaching the impact on my niece and my sister would be.</p><p>Another two hours passed before the phone rang. Hailey nearly threw herself against the wall in her eagerness to answer it. As soon as she did, her gaze flew to me.</p><p>\u201cAunt Lydia\u2019s here with me,\u201d she said into the receiver. Following that, she nodded a couple of times. A minute later, she said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and hung up. Then she burst into tears. \u201cThe hospital\u2019s going to keep Julia overnight\u2014they have her on suicide watch.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>Alix Townsend</p><p>\u201cI want to bake my own wedding cake,\u201d Alix said. She looked at her future mother-in-law and Jacqueline, who both sat across the table from her. They were in Jacqueline\u2019s home, and this meeting was one Alix had delayed as long as she dared. The last time she\u2019d been involved in a wedding discussion had been the Saturday she\u2019d gone to the gym with Colette. Susan had already determined the entire menu for the rehearsal dinner. Why, Alix wondered, had Susan even gone through the facade of soliciting her opinion?</p><p>Instinctively she knew these two women she loved would try to thwart her on the issue of the cake. Alix had done her best to be amenable, biting her tongue, sweeping aside her natural inclinations. The wedding cake, however, was a different matter. Her professional pride was on the line.</p><p>\u201cAlix,\u201d Jacqueline said, sounding sympathetic and conciliatory. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly understandable that you\u2019d want to make your own wedding cake. You\u2019re a baker\u2014it\u2019s what you do.\u201d She gestured vaguely. \u201cBut, darling, you\u2019ve got so many other things to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d Alix insisted. She practically needed diplomatic training to prepare for this wedding. With tolerance and patience (Jordan\u2019s words, not hers), hoping to inspire unity (again from Jordan), Alix had all but given Jacqueline and Susan Turner free rein. However, with the wedding cake, she was determined to get her own way. She had a very distinct idea of what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be far too busy to spend time on the cake,\u201d Susan chimed in, agreeing with Jacqueline.</p><p>The two older women had become friends during all of this. Alix was pleased for them both\u2014and alarmed that neither seemed to realize how much they\u2019d alienated her in the process. They had a vision of what they wanted this wedding to be and as far as Alix could figure, she and Jordan were just props. Alix tried to remember that they loved her and were doing this for her and for Jordan.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019d like something to take my mind off things,\u201d Alix said. Every time she had to deal with another aspect of this stupid wedding, her skin started to itch.</p><p>\u201cAlix,\u201d Jacqueline said in the same tone of voice she used when speaking to three-year-old Amelia. \u201cI don\u2019t think you recognize the pressure you\u2019re putting on yourself.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cSusan and I aren\u2019t saying you can\u2019t bake your cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Alix felt some of the tension leave her shoulders. She reached for her coffee and sipped from the edge of the cup. She didn\u2019t usually drink coffee from anything other than a mug, but Jacqueline didn\u2019t own one. Everything was top-of-the-line china for her.</p><p>Now that her friend was a grandmother twice over, she\u2019d compromised her standards\u2014to a degree. The kitchen was a good example; the cupboards were still stacked with the finest dinnerware, while the bottom drawers contained an assortment of toys and children\u2019s eating utensils. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good plan,\u201d Susan challenged, sitting back and regarding the two of them.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we discuss the cake itself,\u201d Alix said, hurriedly changing the subject. She might still end up attending those diplomacy classes at the rate this was going.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Susan reluctantly agreed.</p><p>\u201cI was at a wedding a couple of years ago,\u201d Jacqueline piped up enthusiastically. \u201cAnd the wedding cake was in-cred-ib-le.\u201d Eyes closed, she enunciated each syllable. \u201cI was surprised to find out it was cheesecake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCheesecake?\u201d Susan repeated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline broke in. \u201cCheesecake would be perfect for the wedding dinner at the country club. It would be such an elegant finishing touch.\u201d</p><p>Susan shook her head, dismissing the idea. \u201cSince my husband\u2019s a pastor, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to attend a large number of weddings. So I can tell you that the huge wedding cake isn\u2019t how it\u2019s done anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d This came from Jacqueline, who looked somewhat taken aback.</p> <p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s a formal cake, but not one of those three-tiered monstrosities that so often dominated a reception table. My heavens,\u201d she said, warming to the subject, \u201cI remember a wedding where there was a larger cake\u2014\u201d she held her hands a distance apart to indicate the size \u201c\u2014and then five or six smaller ones surrounding it. I must say it was all cleverly done. I learned later that the cakes cost\u2014well,\u201d she said, mildly embarrassed. \u201cNone of that\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the very best for Alix,\u201d Jacqueline insisted proudly.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of baking a traditional white cake,\u201d Alix inserted, seeing that the conversation was rapidly getting away from her.</p><p>The room went silent as both women stared at her. Her suggestions seemed to be neither wanted nor appreciated.</p><p>Susan picked up her coffee, and after clearing her throat, said, \u201cWhat I started to explain is that a lot of brides are opting for a variety of flavors. Not everyone enjoys white cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my favorite,\u201d Alix said, although it was plain no one heard her.</p> <p>\u201cThe last wedding I attended served carrot cake and lemon cake and the most delicious chocolate one with a mousse filling,\u201d Susan continued. \u201cI meant to ask what bakery they used but I got sidetracked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrot cake,\u201d Jacqueline repeated, sounding astonished. \u201cHow...unique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was wonderful with the cream cheese frosting.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline nodded excitedly. \u201cThe cheesecake I mentioned was beautifully decorated. I remember wondering what they\u2019d used for frosting and it was a sweetened cream cheese, too. It would be perfect for Alix and Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a traditional white cake?\u201d Alix asked.</p><p>Both women frowned at her as if they\u2019d grown irritated with her interruptions.</p><p>\u201cWe want this to be a wedding everyone remembers,\u201d Jacqueline said kindly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid white cake is just so\u2014\u201d She paused, apparently searching for the right word.</p><p>\u201cOrdinary,\u201d Susan supplied.</p> <p>\u201cYes, ordinary,\u201d Jacqueline echoed.</p><p>\u201cJordan and I would prefer an \u2018ordinary\u2019 wedding and an \u2018ordinary\u2019 cake baked by me.\u201d The only way to get either woman to listen was to speak loudly. She didn\u2019t want to be rude but Alix had taken about all she could stand.</p><p>Not entirely to her surprise, their immediate reaction was silence. Her words seemed to fall like large stones onto the table, startling Jacqueline and Susan.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Jacqueline murmured, looking crestfallen.</p><p>Despite her exasperation with them, Alix felt contrite. She didn\u2019t want to hurt Jacqueline\u2019s feelings, or Susan\u2019s, either. She just wanted them to hear her. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound unappreciative,\u201d she said earnestly, \u201cbut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should ask Jordan,\u201d his mother suggested as if it was necessary to bring in reinforcements.</p><p>Alix hated to drag her fianc\u00e9 into this, and yet it might be the only way to settle the matter once and for all. Jordan knew how badly Alix wanted to bake her own cake. They\u2019d discussed that very subject the night before. True, Jordan had seemed distracted and tired, but he\u2019d agreed she should be able to do this. Alix knew he couldn\u2019t care less if the cake was white, yellow or purple. Like her, he just wanted this affair over with.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s at the church,\u201d Susan pulled her cell phone from her purse and hit speed dial. \u201cJordan Turner, please,\u201d she said, smiling over at Alix.</p><p>Alix crossed her arms and waited impatiently, wishing now that she\u2019d taken the initiative and called him herself.</p><p>\u201cHello, Jordan,\u201d Susan said, her voice brightening now that her son was on the line. \u201cWe\u2019re all here discussing the wedding and we seem to be at a stalemate.\u201d</p><p>After a moment she laughed.</p><p>Alix frowned and wondered what Jordan had said that his mother found so amusing.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, nothing like that,\u201d Susan said next. She glanced at Alix. \u201cNow, about the wedding cake...\u201d</p><p>After a few seconds, Susan sighed audibly and handed the phone to Alix. \u201cJordan wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Alix took it. \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she said unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetie,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Alix kept her voice devoid of emotion, suddenly uncertain whether he even remembered their discussion the night before. Her stomach tensed as a familiar ache came over her. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about the wedding cake?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cJacqueline wants cheesecake, frosted with sweetened cream cheese.\u201d</p><p>He made a noncommittal reply. She supposed that was so she\u2019d know he was listening.</p><p>\u201cYour mother suggested a selection of cakes in a variety of flavors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, too,\u201d he murmured vaguely.</p><p>\u201cJordan, are you listening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI was reading an e-mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is important,\u201d she snapped. She stood up and walked over to the window, presenting her back to Jacqueline and Susan. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about our wedding cake, Jordan. Yours and mine.\u201d In other words, the cake celebrating the beginning of their marriage should be one chosen by them, not anyone else.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s important,\u201d he said. \u201cListen, can you wait a minute? I\u2019ve got a call coming in.\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, Jordan put her on hold. It was fast becoming clear that her fianc\u00e9 was less than interested in the details of their wedding.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, switching back after an irritating two minutes.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d she lied. It was a problem. This whole wedding was. The inside of her elbow started to itch, and Alix scratched at it through the sleeve of her jean jacket.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re discussing the wedding cake,\u201d she reminded him, trying not to sound as annoyed as she actually felt. \u201cYou and I, Jordan,\u201d she said, speaking slowly and distinctly, \u201cdiscussed this very subject last night and we reached a decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what that decision was?\u201d she asked pointedly.</p><p>Jordan laughed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me there\u2019d be a test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and this happens to be a big test,\u201d Alix said evenly. \u201cCall it the final exam.\u201d</p><p>The amusement was gone when he spoke again. \u201cYou\u2019re really upset about this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did we decide last night?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember, do you?\u201d Knowing beforehand that there\u2019d be a showdown with Susan and Jacqueline, Alix had pleaded her case with Jordan. She\u2019d explained how much she wanted to make a personal contribution to their wedding. The cake was perfect for her. She\u2019d baked several wedding cakes already and this was something she could do and do well. Despite what Jacqueline and Susan seemed to think, she was more than capable of making that cake a showpiece.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you to tell your mother what we decided,\u201d Alix repeated, a cold chill running down her spine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Alix, I was tired last night. I had other things on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...see.</p><p>\u201cIs it really that important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not,\u201d she returned. She realized how flippant that sounded\u2014and didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Jordan sighed. \u201cCome on, Alix,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>She reacted with stone-cold silence.</p><p>\u201cI assumed you could make at least one decision on your own. Do what you want. Bake the damn cake if it\u2019s that important to you.\u201d</p><p>Jordan was angry now and not bothering to hide it.</p><p>\u201cI will, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got another call,\u201d he said and without asking, put her on hold again.</p><p>She clicked off the phone. Taking a moment to allow her nerves to settle, Alix turned back to face the two women. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a decision,\u201d she told them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d Susan said.</p><p>\u201cCheesecake?\u201d Jacqueline asked, her eyes wide with hope.</p><p>Alix nodded. \u201cFor one of the cakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to do what I suggested?\u201d Like a little girl who\u2019d been promised a special treat, Susan clapped her hands cheerfully. \u201cWe\u2019ll have several smaller cakes, right?\u201d</p><p>Alix nodded again.</p><p>\u201cEach of the cakes will be a different flavor?\u201d Susan turned to Alix for confirmation. \u201cOne a cheesecake, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Alix walked across the kitchen and gave Susan back her cell.</p><p>\u201cI hope Jordan talked you out of baking it yourself.\u201d Susan dropped the phone in her purse, watching Alix.</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jacqueline looked pleased. \u201cYou\u2019ll thank us later, Alix. Just wait and see.\u201d</p><p>Alix\u2019s cell phone rang and she knew without checking that it was Jordan. She turned it off.</p><p>\u201cYou made the right decision,\u201d Susan assured her. \u201cYou\u2019ll have enough to think about on your wedding day without worrying about the cake.\u201d</p><p>Alix murmured agreement. Only she was seriously beginning to wonder if there\u2019d be a wedding day.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>Colette Blake</p><p>C olette glanced at her watch. She was meeting Steve Grisham for dinner at seven-thirty; it was only ten after now. She\u2019d arrived at the restaurant early. This Italian place was new to her and because she\u2019d walked, Colette had given herself an extra fifteen minutes.</p><p>Actually, it\u2019d been her idea to meet Steve here rather than have him pick her up. Susannah\u2019s husband, Joe, had recommended the restaurant. It was romantic with small, intimate enclaves, dim lighting and flickering candles. The pungent scent of garlic drifted from the kitchen. If the food was half as good as it smelled, she\u2019d be in epicurean heaven.</p><p>Colette wasn\u2019t sure why she hadn\u2019t wanted Steve to come to her apartment. He had before, several times. It just seemed more convenient to meet him here, she told herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The waiter brought her iced tea and she thanked him and paid for it. This was the fourth time she\u2019d gone out with Steve. She enjoyed his company but didn\u2019t feel any real attraction to him or any strong sense of connection beyond friendship, and a fairly casual friendship at that. He\u2019d been Derek\u2019s friend more than hers. She didn\u2019t know if anything had happened between them, but the men had begun to grow apart, although the two couples had still socialized fairly often. Derek and Steve were partners for a few years and then Derek had started a new assignment. Colette had assumed the reassignment came from headquarters. She was no longer so sure of that.</p><p>She felt uneasy with Steve but couldn\u2019t explain precisely why; to some extent, she blamed the fact that she was keeping such an important secret. If they continued to see each other, she\u2019d have to tell him. However, she couldn\u2019t really imagine doing that and wondered if it was such a good idea to go on seeing him. Although Steve hadn\u2019t said anything overt, he\u2019d made it plain that he\u2019d like to deepen their relationship. Colette didn\u2019t want that. Thinking about it, she decided the main reason she\u2019d accepted his invitations was his link with Derek. Her husband was their most consistent topic of conversation. They\u2019d exchanged memories of Derek as a rookie and laughed about the day Steve had helped them move; it\u2019d been midwinter and the men had accidentally killed most of Colette\u2019s houseplants, leaving them in the cold truck for hours. They\u2019d recalled happy times, like the New Year\u2019s Eve after Steve\u2019s first daughter was born and the four of them had stayed up all night, delirious with exhaustion. Steve sometimes talked about the end of his marriage, too.</p><p>What she and Steve had in common besides their memories was their pain. But was this a solid basis for the kind of relationship he seemed to want?</p><p>Colette forced herself not to consider these uncomfortable thoughts for the moment. Since she had a few minutes to wait, she decided to check her mail, which she\u2019d slipped into her purse on the way out. The first two envelopes contained bills. The following three or four pieces were junk mail and the last was a card, addressed to her. She immediately recognized the handwriting as Christian\u2019s.</p> <p>The night before, Colette had dreamed of him. She\u2019d awakened around three that morning and hadn\u2019t been able to get back to sleep. Those dreams shouldn\u2019t have surprised her, though. Christian constantly turned up in her thoughts. She was in love with him and she worried about his future. She hadn\u2019t told his great-aunt any of what she knew. How could she disillusion this woman who loved him so much?</p><p>It annoyed and perplexed Colette that she was always looking for him. A man would walk past Susannah\u2019s Garden and for a split second she\u2019d think it was Christian. Her heart would race with excitement\u2014and then she\u2019d recognize that she\u2019d made a mistake.</p><p>Reading the handwritten return address on the card, she frowned. In all the years she\u2019d worked for Christian, she couldn\u2019t remember him ever sending a card. But then she wouldn\u2019t, would she? He could mail out a thousand such cards and she\u2019d never know it.</p><p>Feeling nervous, she delayed opening the envelope. Then she couldn\u2019t stand to wait another second. Steve wouldn\u2019t be there for five or ten minutes; she had plenty of time. Eagerly she tore open the envelope and withdrew a small card, a single sheet of heavy deckle-edged paper.</p><p>She read the short note he\u2019d written. I wish you only happiness, Colette. But I\u2019m not sure Steve Grisham is the man who will give it to you.</p> <p>A comment like this was so unlike Christian that Colette just stared at the card. As he\u2019d promised, Christian had stayed out of her life\u2014until now, until this.</p><p>She still believed Christian Dempsey was a man of his word. Once she\u2019d told him she didn\u2019t want to see him again, he\u2019d made no attempt to contact her. That he\u2019d done so now meant he knew something about Steve, something he felt she needed to know. Otherwise he would never have broken his word; Colette was positive of that.</p><p>\u201cYou seem very absorbed,\u201d Steve murmured, standing beside the table. He kissed her cheek before pulling out a chair to join her.</p><p>Colette quickly slipped the mail back inside her handbag.</p><p>\u201cI see you got a head start on me,\u201d Steve said and nodded toward her glass of tea, apparently believing it was the Long Island variety. He raised his hand to get the waiter\u2019s attention and motioned that he wanted a glass for himself and another for Colette. She smiled, thinking how shocked he\u2019d be when plain iced tea was delivered.</p><p>Their dinner was enjoyable. Steven had quickly switched to wine and he ordered port following the meal. She declined, choosing decaf coffee instead. As always, her date was charming and personable. They shared the usual reminiscences of Derek, and Steve regaled her with stories about his job and the investigation he\u2019d just wrapped up. He seemed to know people wherever they went. Apparently, not everyone had heard about his divorce, and Colette received several curious looks. They lingered over their drinks and talked until Colette yawned and said she really did need to get home. After collecting his car from a nearby parking garage, Steve drove her the short distance to her apartment.</p> <p>\u201cI had a lovely evening,\u201d she told him. And it was true, although Christian\u2019s warning was never far from her mind.</p><p>\u201cI did, too,\u201d Steve said, leaning close.</p><p>They kissed, his mouth moving fervently over hers until she squirmed away. When they broke apart, Steve whispered, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to invite me in for coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She smiled and gently kissed his cheek. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>Steve released a sigh. \u201cColette, Derek\u2019s been gone over a year now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d she said in a small voice.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems longer than that.\u201d He pressed his thumb against her chin and inclined her face toward his. \u201cIt\u2019s time you moved on with your life,\u201d he urged, his eyes warm. \u201cDerek wouldn\u2019t have wanted you to hide yourself away, working in this\u2014\u201d he hesitated, apparently searching for the right word \u201c\u2014obscure little flower shop. He\u2019d want you to be happy.\u201d Once more he lowered his lips to hers. \u201cI can do that for you, Colette,\u201d he promised in a husky voice. \u201cI can help you remember what it means to be loved and cherished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2014\u201d The words clogged her throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pressuring you,\u201d Steve said, kissing the side of her neck. \u201cJust know that I\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>In her rush to escape, Colette reached blindly for the door handle and nearly fell out of the car.</p><p>\u201cThank you again for dinner,\u201d she said. She couldn\u2019t get inside the apartment fast enough. Without looking back, she scrabbled for her keys and let herself in. Her heart pounded as she leaned breathlessly against the closed door. A moment later, she secured the dead bolt. She stood there motionless, her hand on he forehead. What was wrong with her? It was more than Christian\u2019s message. More than her own sense of caution. Only Colette didn\u2019t know what.</p><p>Sunday afternoon, Colette picked up the phone, put it down and paced her tiny living room, wondering if she was doing the right thing. Then determination took hold and she picked up the phone. She called directory assistance; half a minute later, she had Jeanine Grisham\u2019s number.</p><p>Jeanine answered on the third ring.</p><p>\u201cHello, Jeanine,\u201d Colette said, hoping she sounded cheerful, when in fact her hands trembled with a combination of anxiety and fear. \u201cThis is Colette Blake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColette! Oh, my goodness, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She hesitated and then decided to plunge into the reason for her call. \u201cI heard about you and Steve. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too, but the girls and I are doing well.\u201d Jeanine paused. \u201cI heard via the grapevine that you sold the house and moved. Are you still in Seattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...yes.\u201d Colette explained the changes\u2014some of the changes\u2014in her own life since they\u2019d last talked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been ages! I meant to keep in touch after Derek\u2019s funeral, but you know what they say about good intentions. By then, Steve and I were having major problems\u2014and well, I was pretty consumed by all of that. How did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve told me you\u2019d moved to Yakima to be closer to your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor that and other reasons,\u201d Jeanine confirmed. \u201cSo you\u2019ve been in touch with Steve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...Actually, he\u2019s why I phoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked you out?\u201d Jeanine\u2019s voice cooled considerably. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Jeanine said without emotion. \u201cSteve and I are no longer married. If you want to date him, you don\u2019t need my permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Colette looked out the window to the alley below. The conversation had grown uncomfortable, but she\u2019d come this far and wouldn\u2019t turn back now. \u201cSteve...he never really explained why you got a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he probably wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Jeanine murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just started to date again,\u201d Colette said. \u201cDerek and I were married for a long time, and the whole dating scene\u2019s changed so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me?\u201d Jeanine laughed lightly, the tension in her voice gone.</p><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s a whole new world for both of us, I was hoping you wouldn\u2019t mind if I asked you a few questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Jeanine said. \u201cHey, I\u2019m no expert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, can I ask you a few questions about Steve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see...\u201d The wariness was back. \u201cColette, I like you. I\u2019ve always liked you, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right person to talk to about my ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else would know Steve the way you do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Jeanine\u2019s laugh lacked any pretense of humor. \u201cOh, about fifty other women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColette, I\u2019ll be blunt here. Steve couldn\u2019t keep his fly zipped.\u201d</p><p>Colette sank onto the edge of the sofa. \u201cSteve...cheated on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was more than that. He screwed anything in a skirt.\u201d She snorted in disgust. \u201cHe was indiscriminate. Any woman who was available\u2014and some who weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Colette felt like she was going to be sick.</p><p>\u201cYou know this for a fact?\u201d she finally managed to say.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. It started even before we were married. I heard from a friend, a good friend, that she\u2019d seen Steve with another woman about a week before our wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ask him about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. He made up this completely credible story about this other girl being a cousin of his. When I mentioned this to my friend, she said they were obviously kissing cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Colette hated opening old wounds like this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe only one to blame is me. I was gullible enough to believe him. The man is a consummate liar. He\u2019ll lie even when it\u2019s more convenient to tell the truth. It\u2019s his nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...he\u2019s a detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstonishing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say anything I haven\u2019t asked myself a dozen times,\u201d Jeanine told her. \u201cSteve can be the most devoted, wonderful man in the world\u2014when he feels like it. The girls adore him, even now, and yet he practically ignores their existence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re his children.\u201d Colette found herself getting angry on Jeanine\u2019s behalf.</p><p>\u201cOut of sight, out of mind,\u201d Jeanine muttered.</p><p>\u201cBut you stuck it out for so many years. Why did you divorce him now?\u201d</p><p>Jeanine\u2019s sigh came in a long rush. \u201cMy parents asked me the same question and I wish I knew the answer. I think Steve was more shocked than anyone. I didn\u2019t even ask him if he was seeing someone else. He probably was, but I didn\u2019t really care anymore and that frightened me. My emotions had become paralyzed, and that made me realize what I was doing. Over the years, Steve had become blatant in his affairs. I\u2019d turned a blind eye for so long I literally couldn\u2019t see anymore.\u201d</p> <p>Colette heard the pain in her friend\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cOne morning I woke up,\u201d Jeanine continued, \u201cand I knew that if I didn\u2019t get out of this marriage I\u2019d lose my sanity. Steve left for work and I phoned my parents and asked if I could move in with them until I found an apartment in Yakima. They agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went that day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat same day,\u201d Jeanine said. \u201cI knew with absolute certainty that I wouldn\u2019t change my mind. It wasn\u2019t just my pride at stake, or my children\u2019s future. I know this might sound melodramatic...but my very soul was at risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Steve ask you to reconsider?\u201d</p><p>Jeanine snickered softly. \u201cHe was convinced I\u2019d come back and God knows he tried to talk me into it. He can be persuasive when he wants. What he didn\u2019t understand was that he\u2019d killed whatever love I\u2019d felt for him. To be fair, I\u2019d threatened to leave him any number of times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you ever do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, more fool me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took him six months to figure out I wasn\u2019t moving back to Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never let on, all the times we saw you. I would never have believed Steve was that kind of man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the sad part. I couldn\u2019t believe it even when I had the evidence right in front of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to see him again.\u201d Colette\u2019s mind was made up about that. Christian\u2019s note and her own instinctive reaction to Steve were all she needed to know that Jeanine had told her the truth. Deep down she\u2019d felt something was wrong, but she couldn\u2019t identify it. Because she hadn\u2019t trusted her instincts, it was Christian\u2019s note that had prompted her to contact Steve\u2019s ex-wife. How Christian had learned this about Steve, she had no idea.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smart,\u201d Jeanine said. \u201cI don\u2019t think many women ever talk to the ex-wife before getting involved with a guy.\u201d</p><p>Colette didn\u2019t enlighten her, but she wasn\u2019t nearly as smart as Jeanine thought. Without Christian Dempsey, she probably would\u2019ve let her relationship with Steve drift on, a relationship that could only have brought her heartbreak.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p> <p>\u201cNo matter how much skill, passion and creativity one brings to knitting, you can\u2019t make something better than the quality of the yarn you use.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca Deeprose, www.arizonaknittingandneedlepoint.com</p><p>Lydia Goetz</p><p>Margaret and I talked it over yet again, and decided not to tell our mother about the carjacking. Her physical and emotional health was fragile and growing more so all the time. It would\u2019ve been too much for her.</p><p>The problem neither of us foresaw was her intuitive awareness of her children. Neither of us said a word, but somehow Mom sensed that something was wrong. She asked repeatedly if everything was all right. Again and again I assured her it was.</p><p>\u201cLydia,\u201d she said the minute I stepped into her room. \u201cWhere\u2019s Margaret?\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t exactly the greeting I\u2019d hoped to receive, and not only because it reminded me that Margaret had always been closer to her than I was. \u201cShe\u2019s at the shop,\u201d I explained, coming into Mom\u2019s room. \u201cBusiness was a bit slow this afternoon, so I thought I\u2019d take some time and come for a visit.\u201d I didn\u2019t mention that Margaret had purposely stayed behind.</p><p>Mom sat in her favorite chair in front of the television, which had become her main source of entertainment. She used to rarely turn it on. These days the set was constantly tuned to one program or another. I sometimes wondered if Mom actually turned it off when she slept.</p><p>Mom pursed her lips. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Margaret in days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t she here on Sunday?\u201d I asked, although I already knew the answer. Margaret and Matt had come by early in the afternoon, the first time they\u2019d left Julia alone since she was released from the hospital. Margaret had fretted the entire time and they\u2019d gone home after only the briefest of visits.</p><p>Mom picked up the remote and lowered the volume on her television. She was watching one of those courtroom programs with ordinary people appearing before a judge. \u201cWhen are you going to tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>I sighed. At that moment I wanted to tell her everything. I couldn\u2019t, though. If she learned about the carjacking it should be from my sister, not me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have for lunch?\u201d I asked instead.</p><p>Mom\u2019s eyes returned to the television. \u201cI don\u2019t think I went in for lunch this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>One of the advantages provided by the assisted living complex was that they served three balanced meals a day. Margaret and I had carefully evaluated a number of places before selecting this one. For us, the meals had been a selling feature, and so were the many social events.</p><p>Mom had her own apartment and even a tiny kitchen with a microwave and refrigerator. Best of all, she was surrounded by her own things. Margaret and I had gone through the house before it was sold, choosing pieces we knew she particularly loved. Mom was pleased that we were able to get so much of her furniture into her new home; it was a comfort to have familiar things after so many unnerving changes.</p><p>I was immediately alarmed to learn she\u2019d skipped lunch. \u201cMom, you\u2019re diabetic. You need to eat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, honey, I know. I had some tuna on a cracker.\u201d She sent me a weary look that pleaded for understanding. \u201cI don\u2019t seem to have much of an appetite.\u201d</p><p>It was more than skipping a meal that concerned me. She also needed the social contact. I hated the thought of Mom sitting alone in her room for days on end. When she\u2019d first moved into the complex, Margaret and I were ecstatic at how quickly she\u2019d made friends with her tablemates. But Helen Hamilton had moved to Indiana a month ago to be closer to her children. And Joyce Corwin had died of a stroke. Both losses had been blows to my mother. She\u2019d been far more reclusive ever since.</p><p>\u201cMargaret\u2019s fine, Mom,\u201d I said, trying to reassure her. \u201cEveryone is.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t have said that if I didn\u2019t believe it to be true. Julia had given us all a scare, but the counselors had been wonderful, helping my niece deal with the tumble of emotions that sometimes overwhelmed crime victims. Julia met regularly with a group of other people who\u2019d undergone similar ordeals. They\u2019d helped her cope with her anger, and perhaps more profound, the sense of vulnerability.</p><p>Personally, I felt the sessions might help Margaret, too. I happen to like my head, however, and I knew my sister would\u2019ve bitten it off had I suggested she meet with a support group herself.</p><p>Mom reached for my hand. \u201cTell me about the yarn store. You say business is down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot down. In fact, we\u2019re doing better than ever. This afternoon was a bit slow, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to tell you about my classes?\u201d I asked. Mom used to enjoy hearing about them. I\u2019ve run classes for beginning knitters; I also taught sock-knitting on circular needles and held a workshop on Thursday mornings for anyone who had a knitting problem. The charity knitting class on Friday afternoons continued, too.</p><p>Mom stared blankly at me. \u201cPerhaps some other day,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you taught.\u201d She smiled rather proudly at me.</p><p>I decided to try something else. \u201cYou remember Alix Townsend, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Mom frowned.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe she could possibly have forgotten Alix. \u201cShe was in my original class.\u201d Mom had met her dozens of times over the past three years.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, yes, the one with the baby.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t correct her. \u201cAlix is taking my prayer shawl class. She hopes that knitting will get her through the wedding jitters.\u201d</p><p>Mom\u2019s face lit up. \u201cAlix is getting married. That\u2019s wonderful news.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard and realized Mom didn\u2019t remember Alix at all. I didn\u2019t know when she\u2019d slid so far downhill mentally, and it worried me. I should\u2019ve noticed this long before now. I wondered if she\u2019d become adept at disguising what she understood and what she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lovely wedding,\u201d I went on in a bright voice. \u201cBrad and I are invited.\u201d</p><p>Mom frowned again.</p><p>\u201cYou remember Brad, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Mom nodded, but I knew she didn\u2019t. A sick feeling settled in the pit of my stomach. In my recent concerns over Margaret and my own busy life, I hadn\u2019t been sufficiently aware of Mom\u2019s decline.</p><p>\u201cYou know who I\u2019m looking for?\u201d Mom asked, twisting around as she spoke.</p><p>I turned, too, assuming she\u2019d misplaced something and needed me to find it.</p><p>\u201cSpunky,\u201d Mom said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him all day.\u201d</p><p>Spunky had been our family dog when I was a child, a self-assured little terrier who\u2019d adored my mother. He\u2019d been dead for years. The last thing I wanted to do was tell my mother that the dog she\u2019d loved had died\u2014even if it happened decades ago.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s lost and can\u2019t find his way home,\u201d she worried.</p><p>We\u2019d had a fenced yard and Spunky had never escaped or run away from it. But I needed to tell Mom something that would reassure her and give her peace. \u201cJust wait. He never goes far,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good dog.\u201d Mom smiled. \u201cDo you see his mouse anywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpunky had a mouse?\u201d I didn\u2019t remember any such toy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little stuffed animal,\u201d she reminded me, staring down at the floor.</p><p>Then it came to me. I did remember the mouse, which wasn\u2019t a mouse at all, but a small stuffed poodle that Spunky carried from room to room and had with him almost constantly. The fact that my mother remembered that and not my husband astonished me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine where he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Spunky died at about the time of my first cancer diagnosis when I was sixteen. Margaret had wanted to get another dog right away. Dad said no, and it wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t want another family pet. Just then, taking care of me was all he could handle. My sister knew that and added one more resentment to the pile she was accumulating. One more resentment against me.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything before I leave?\u201d I asked Mom. Instantly I could tell she didn\u2019t want me to go.</p><p>\u201cYou just got here,\u201d she said accusingly.</p> <p>Actually, I\u2019d been with her for over an hour. \u201cI need to get back to the shop and then home to Brad and Cody,\u201d I told her as gently as I could. From the blank look in her eyes, I knew she didn\u2019t recognize either.</p><p>\u201cWill you come tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I\u2019d make the time and if I couldn\u2019t, I\u2019d ask Margaret to visit. Before I left, I hugged her and made sure she was comfortable. I handed her the remote and Mom flipped up the volume on yet another judge show, one with a woman on the bench.</p><p>As I stepped into the hallway, Rosalie Mullin, the staff nurse who gave Mom her insulin injections, passed me. I stopped her. \u201cHow have Mom\u2019s blood sugars been?\u201d I asked, remembering that she said she\u2019d skipped lunch. A cracker with a bit of tuna could hardly be considered a meal.</p><p>\u201cHer sugars have been good.\u201d She paused, then said, \u201cThe diabetes is under control.\u201d Her eyes held mine.</p> <p>Rosalie\u2019s hesitation told me she had other concerns. \u201cThere\u2019s another problem, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cPerhaps we should talk in my office. I can be there in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>I took the elevator to the bottom floor, where I waited outside Rosalie\u2019s office. She seemed to be away far longer than a few minutes, but that might have been due to my nervousness. Each minute felt like at least ten.</p><p>Without a word, Rosalie ushered me into her office. She sat behind her desk and motioned to the chair on the other side. With a lump in my throat, I perched stiffly on the edge of the cushion.</p><p>Already I could feel the beginnings of a headache. Probably because of the brain tumors, I\u2019m prone to migraine headaches. They\u2019re crippling, and they can last for days. It\u2019d been months since I had one and I chose to believe that this was a simple tension headache and forced myself to ignore the nausea and dizziness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d been planning to call you and your sister,\u201d Rosalie said. She reached for a file from the stack on her desk and opened it. \u201cI\u2019ve asked the assistants to keep tabs on your mother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been missing a lot of meals, growing less social and showing signs of paranoia. She was reacting badly to the Aricept, so the doctor took her off. He warned me she might lose ground quickly and she has. Unfortunately, one of the symptoms of this sort of decline is lack of appetite.\u201d</p><p>My first inclination was to defend Mom, to make excuses for her. \u201cI\u2019m sure that has something to do with losing both Helen and Joyce in such a short time. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to eat, either.\u201d</p><p>Rosalie agreed with me. \u201cTo a point, that\u2019s true. However, I\u2019ve started to notice other signs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid your mother\u2019s showing early symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>That had been my worry, as well, although I couldn\u2019t verbalize it, even to myself.</p><p>\u201cAs far as meals go, what about bringing them to her?\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do that, of course,\u201d Rosalie assured me. \u201cThere\u2019s an additional charge after a certain number of delivered meals. But what I\u2019m trying to say isn\u2019t about your mother\u2019s eating or her diabetes.\u201d Her eyes were sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m thinking the time is fast approaching when her needs will exceed what we have to offer her.\u201d</p><p>My mouth was dry. The light from the lamp on her desk was bothering my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not suggesting a nursing home, are you?\u201d The thought of placing my mother in one was more than I could bear.</p><p>\u201cNot a nursing home,\u201d Rosalie told me. \u201cA memory care facility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMemory care?\u201d I repeated. I\u2019d never heard of such a thing.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re wonderful for people like your mother. There\u2019s a greater level of individual care, and the environment is more controlled. I\u2019d recommend that you and your sister visit a few, talk to the staff, get a feel for each place. I can give you information on three of them.\u201d She opened a drawer, removed a file and handed me a sheet with names and addresses. \u201cI\u2019m familiar with all of these, and I can guarantee that Mrs. Hoffman would be well looked after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said shakily as I stood. My eyes had started to water and I wasn\u2019t sure if it was because of the light or my emotions. Probably both.</p><p>By then I knew I needed to get home as quickly as possible. I don\u2019t usually talk on my cell phone while I\u2019m driving, but this was an emergency. At least it felt like one. My first call was to my husband, who was just getting off work.</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetheart,\u201d he said as he answered. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriving. I probably shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d I said, hardly able to function now as my head throbbed painfully. \u201cI\u2019m on my way home. I have a migraine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour medication\u2019s at the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d At one time I carried it with me, but after all these months I\u2019d become careless. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right once I\u2019m home,\u201d I said. \u201cI should have asked the nurse for a painkiller, but it didn\u2019t enter my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive minutes from the house.\u201d That was true on a good day, but it was rush hour and the traffic would slow me down.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall Margaret for me,\u201d I said. \u201cAsk her to close the store. She\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Anything else?\u201d I heard the concern in his voice.</p><p>I swallowed a sob and when I spoke my voice was hoarse with emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s Mom, Brad. She\u2019s not doing well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be home as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I clicked off the phone and exited the freeway. By the time I\u2019d pulled into the garage and made my way into the house, the pain in my head was blinding me. I stumbled down the hallway to the bathroom, where we kept the medications. Turning on the light wasn\u2019t an option. I found the bottle in the cabinet more by luck than intent, nearly ripped off the cap and swallowed the pill without water.</p><p>Keeping my eyes closed I braced my hand against the wall and dragged myself into our bedroom. The first thing I did was close the shades. Once the room was dark, I undressed and climbed into bed. Soon the medication would kick in and the pain would subside. Tears crept from my eyes, sliding down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I sobbed. \u201cOh, Mom.\u201d She wasn\u2019t there to comfort me and would never be again. Nor, it seemed, could I comfort her.</p><p>The tragedy of this disease was that it took away so much of who my mother was. She\u2019d become completely dependent on Margaret and me to make decisions for her. As her mental capacities diminished, we\u2019d be assuming all responsibility for her care. Most painful, perhaps, was her growing inability to remember her own life. My sister and I would have to be the keepers of her memories, for her and for ourselves.</p><p>Margaret had talked about how much she missed our mother, and I knew now that we\u2019d be missing her more and more.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>Alix Townsend</p><p>When Colette met her at Go Figure, Alix could tell that she was worried about something. For that matter, so was Alix. They completed their workout routine and then went for a drink at a nearby restaurant.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking very thoughtful,\u201d Colette said, sipping her herbal iced tea.</p><p>\u201cYou are, too,\u201d Alix said. She wasn\u2019t about to let Colette\u2019s uncharacteristic silence that morning slip past without comment.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right between you and Jordan?\u201d Colette asked.</p><p>Alix shrugged, dismissing the comment. Her relationship with Jordan was strained at the moment; it\u2019d all started with the wedding cake and escalated from there. She\u2019d avoided him since then and he seemed to be avoiding her, which only complicated matters. \u201cWe had a...difference of opinion. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>Colette studied her. \u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>Alix reached for her iced coffee and took a deep swallow before answering. \u201cWhat else? The wedding.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so it was an actual argument, not merely what you\u2019d call a friendly difference of opinion. Alix had been good and angry, and she hadn\u2019t been afraid to let Jordan know how badly he\u2019d disappointed her. Now, though, their disagreement was about more than the wedding.</p><p>Alix didn\u2019t doubt that Jordan loved her. That wasn\u2019t the point. The problem was he hadn\u2019t listened; worse, he hadn\u2019t heard anything she\u2019d said. Because of that, Alix had been forced to surrender herself one more time at the altar of this blasted wedding.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Alix asked. She wasn\u2019t spilling her guts if Colette wasn\u2019t willing to do the same. That was what friends did.</p><p>Colette sipped her tea. \u201cI won\u2019t be dating Steve Grisham again.\u201d</p><p>Alix sat up. This was news. \u201cThat\u2019s the detective, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Alix had no time for what she sarcastically called the boys in blue. She didn\u2019t know even one who didn\u2019t lie through his teeth. Not only that, they saw what they wanted to see. She\u2019d gone down on a bogus drug charge because of her roommate. The cop had been ready to believe the lie as long as it added to his arrest record. Alix didn\u2019t plan to forgive either him or her onetime friend.</p><p>She knew Colette had recently met Steve for a fancy dinner. Alix didn\u2019t have that much experience with detectives, but she figured they weren\u2019t any better than the cops on the street. Out of respect for Colette\u2019s dead husband, Alix hadn\u2019t shared her opinion of the police. \u201cDid Columbo put the moves on you?\u201d</p><p>Colette grinned. \u201cNo, but I talked to his ex-wife and learned a few things that...I didn\u2019t know and, well, it was obvious this was never going to work out, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Alix wasn\u2019t convinced Colette should listen to the ex. Still, she tended to believe it was a mistake for Colette to date any man other than Christian Dempsey when she was so clearly in love with him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think the ex-wife might have her own agenda?\u201d Alix asked.</p><p>Colette shrugged. \u201cIf it was someone else, I might think so, but not Jeanine. We were good friends once, the four of us, and then Derek got transferred and we didn\u2019t see as much of them. Now I wonder...Jeanine was always friendly but there were times she seemed distant. I thought it might\u2019ve been me. She never talked about it. But it turns out Steve\u2019s been unfaithful for years, so it all sort of makes sense now. Besides, he\u2019s just a little too smooth, a little too...practiced, especially around women.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDoes Columbo know you don\u2019t plan to see him again?\u201d</p><p>Colette shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019ll get the message soon enough.\u201d She sipped her iced tea again. \u201cEnough about me. You\u2019ve been in a bad mood all day. Are you going to tell me what\u2019s really going on?\u201d</p><p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Alix explained her ongoing disagreement with Jordan, and described the incident the previous week.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t let Jacqueline and Susan treat you like this,\u201d Colette exclaimed.</p> <p>\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d Alix muttered. It wasn\u2019t as if she hadn\u2019t tried.</p><p>There was a brief silence, then Colette asked, \u201cYou\u2019re close to Jacqueline, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Alix nodded. She used to be, but lately she wasn\u2019t so sure. Jacqueline was protective and a real advocate in ways Alix treasured, but when it came to this wedding, she had a will of iron. She made very clear that she was the social expert, and her ideas were not to be ignored.</p><p>\u201cTalk to her one-on-one,\u201d Colette suggested. \u201cRemind her that it\u2019s your wedding. Tell her you appreciate everything she\u2019s done but you feel like the wedding\u2019s not about you anymore.\u201d</p><p>Colette was right; any reference to the wedding these days was enough to make her cringe. This couldn\u2019t go on. Alix was at odds with Jordan and just about everyone else involved with this wedding. It was time to mend some fences....</p> <p>When they finished their drinks, Colette went out to do errands and Alix took the bus home. Since the guesthouse was behind the main house and next to the garage, Alix saw right away that both cars were there. Reese\u2019s golf clubs were leaning against his trunk.</p><p>Alix knew she had to talk to Jacqueline today. This wedding belonged to her, and as much as she valued everything the Donovans and Turners were doing, she could no longer remain silent.</p><p>She knocked at the back door and then entered. Reese was sitting at the table, a cup of coffee in hand, his newspaper propped up against the floral centerpiece. He smiled at Alix.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the bride-to-be?\u201d he asked with his usual cheer.</p><p>Alix shrugged and gave him a wry grin in response. \u201cReese, I need to talk to Jacqueline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on the phone in my office,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Typical. Jacqueline had more friends and acquaintances than anyone Alix knew. \u201cIs it okay if I wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Reese glanced at his watch. \u201cI\u2019ve got a golf game in half an hour. Do you mind if I leave you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>Reese stood and retrieved his sweater. \u201cGrab a coffee if you want,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Already had one.\u201d</p><p>Reese left with a jaunty wave, and Alix wished him a good game.</p><p>Having once worked as the Donovans\u2019 housekeeper, Alix automatically folded the newspaper and placed Reese\u2019s cup in the dishwasher. She wiped down the counter as she waited for Jacqueline to finish her call. Then she decided she should probably let her know she was in the house. Not that she wanted to rush her or anything; Jacqueline could talk as long as she liked. In fact, the more time she spent on the phone, the longer Alix had to prepare for their conversation. She tried not to think of it as a showdown\u2014just a congenial but necessary discussion with a friend.</p><p>Walking down the hall to the office, Alix heard Jacqueline speaking and stopped when her name was mentioned.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d suggest something like that,\u201d Jacqueline said, sounding irate.</p><p>Alix froze. She hadn\u2019t come to listen in on a private conversation and yet, when she heard her own name, she couldn\u2019t make herself leave.</p><p>A few minutes later, she realized that the person on the other end of the line was none other than Susan Turner.</p><p>\u201cJordan doesn\u2019t have any such concerns, does he?\u201d Jacqueline asked, obviously dismayed.</p><p>A pause.</p><p>\u201cI should think not.\u201d Jacqueline seemed satisfied with the response, whatever it was.</p><p>Alix breathed a bit easier.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me Alix is unconventional,\u201d Jacqueline said next. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t make Jordan a good wife.\u201d</p><p>It felt as if the floor had just dropped. So that was it. Susan didn\u2019t think she was the right wife for her son. Alix had suspected as much and now her suspicions were confirmed.</p><p>\u201cOf course Jordan will be a senior pastor one day,\u201d Jacqueline said. \u201cAnd Alix will\u2014\u201d</p><p>Whatever Jacqueline intended to say was abruptly cut off.</p><p>Alix didn\u2019t want to hear any more of this conversation. She knew what Susan was saying and to be fair, it was a question she\u2019d asked herself a dozen times since the engagement.</p><p>What kind of pastor\u2019s wife would she be?</p><p>Apparently, her future mother-in-law had her doubts. Alix didn\u2019t blame Susan Turner; she had concerns of her own in that department. Jordan was the only one who seemed convinced that she was perfect for him and his ministry.</p><p>In light of her current feelings, that was a real laugh. What had she been thinking when she agreed to marry Jordan? What was she thinking? For the past couple of years, everything had been going so well. Jacqueline and Reese had given her a step up in life. They\u2019d provided a home and part-time employment. Not only that, Reese had helped her with tuition to culinary school. Then she\u2019d been hired by the French Caf\u00e9. During that whole time, she\u2019d been dating Jordan. And\u2014during that whole time\u2014she\u2019d been blinded to the truth.</p><p>Good things don\u2019t last. Not for women like her.</p><p>Alix had been riding a wave, but that wave had crested and she was about to be swept into shark-infested waters. Women like her, girls with her background and her past, weren\u2019t destined for a decent life. They ended up on the street, society throwaways, refuse. No better than garbage headed for a dump.</p><p>Alix hurried into her small guesthouse and placed her hands over her ears to block out the voices that were shouting at her. This was \u201cstinking thinking\u201d at its worst. Those ugly, frightening demons of hate seemed relentless, determined to push her into the gutter. To punish her.</p><p>Damn, she needed a cigarette. The craving was worse than ever and she deserved one. She wanted one, she needed one, and she didn\u2019t care if anyone saw her with it, either.</p><p>She walked down to the corner store and bought a pack, shocked at how expensive they\u2019d gotten since she\u2019d quit. She wasn\u2019t even out of the store before she tore open the pack and pulled out a cigarette.</p><p>Her hands shook as she struck the match. Already she could feel a sense of calm and anticipation. Lighting the cigarette, she inhaled deeply and nearly choked. It tasted like shit.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d She tossed it on the ground and stomped it out as if she were Smoky the Bear wiping out the first forest fire of the season.</p><p>Her cell chirped. She removed it from her purse to see who it was, frowning when Jordan\u2019s name showed up on caller ID. She wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk to him. Or anybody else, either. They\u2019d parted on shaky ground and had ignored each other ever since. Feeling the way she did just then, Alix didn\u2019t know what she might say.</p><p>She was tempted to turn off her cell; she didn\u2019t but she waited a few extra minutes before she listened to her messages. There was only the one.</p><p>\u201cAlix, it\u2019s Jordan. Call me, all right?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>He phoned again an hour later as she sat alone in her dimly lit room. And again she waited for his message.</p><p>\u201cAlix,\u201d he said, his voice more than a little exasperated. \u201cI know you\u2019re screening your calls. This is crazy. We need to talk. I\u2019m going over to my parents\u2019 and Mom\u2019s invited you to dinner, too. She said there\u2019s something she wants to talk over with us. Call me.\u201d</p><p>Alix nearly threw the phone across the room. She knew what Susan wanted to discuss. Her. The question being raised was whether Alix would be an appropriate wife for Susan Turner\u2019s son, the minister. The good boy who was about to marry the bad girl. Well, screw them all.</p><p>Alix fell on the bed, staring up at the ceiling. What she ought to do was pack her bags and leave. That was it. She\u2019d walk away. Let them think what they wanted. She didn\u2019t care anymore.</p><p>To her surprise, she fell asleep and when she woke it was dark outside. It took her a moment to recognize the sound of someone knocking. Disoriented, she sat up and let her eyes adjust to the dark before she stumbled over to the door. She turned on the light and saw Jacqueline, hands cupped around her face as she peered in through the small window.</p><p>Alix opened the door.</p><p>\u201cAlix?\u201d Jacqueline asked, looking worried. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. She pushed the disheveled hair out of her face. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t answering your phone.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t tell Jacqueline she\u2019d turned off her cell. \u201cI was asleep.\u201d That was the truth, after all.</p><p>\u201cJordan called me to see if you were home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jordan again. Good, let him worry. \u201cWhat time is it anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt night?\u201d Alix couldn\u2019t believe it. She\u2019d been asleep for hours.</p><p>Jacqueline nodded. \u201cCome on over to the house and let\u2019s talk. You must be starved. When did you last eat?\u201d</p><p>Alix couldn\u2019t remember; still, she wasn\u2019t sure she was in the mood to deal with Jacqueline\u2019s concern. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you got?\u201d</p><p>Her friend laughed. \u201cYour favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacaroni and cheese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too.\u201d</p><p>Alix hesitated. The voices weren\u2019t shouting at her as loudly as before, but they were still there, reminding her that she\u2019d never be good enough for Jordan. She refused to listen. Jacqueline was right, though; she was hungry.</p><p>Stepping outside, she closed the door and followed her to the house.</p><p>\u201cReese said you stopped by to talk to me this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Alix yawned before dismissing the need to have the conversation she\u2019d planned hours earlier. \u201cNothing important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t stay long,\u201d Jacqueline commented as she led the way into the main house.</p><p>\u201cNo...I waited for a few minutes and you were still on the phone. Like I said, it wasn\u2019t all that important, so I went out for a while.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline stopped, lean closed and sniffed the air. \u201cDo I smell cigarette smoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you were with a smoker?\u201d</p><p>Alix shrugged. She couldn\u2019t lie but she was willing to stretch the truth when necessary.</p><p>\u201cSmoking\u2019s such a disgusting habit. I\u2019m so grateful you gave it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Alix agreed. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>Colette Blake</p><p>Colette read the simple handwritten invitation a second time. The gold-embossed card had arrived in the mail that afternoon. It was a request for Colette to join Elizabeth Sasser for dinner on Friday night. Elizabeth wrote with a fountain pen and her handwriting was much like the woman herself: blunt and forthright. Although it was technically an invitation, the card read more like a summons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Despite her reservations, which had to do with her knowledge of Christian\u2019s recent activities, Colette was eager to visit the older woman. She\u2019d liked Elizabeth immensely and felt she\u2019d developed a sense of Christian as a motherless boy, then a disillusioned teenager and an angry young adult. Christian was confident enough to stand up to his father and fight for his own choices in life. Colette appreciated the courage that must have taken and it made her wonder why he was risking everything now, why he was violating the principles he believed in for foolish gain. Colette could hardly imagine what his great-aunt would think when Christian was arrested. He would be sooner or later, and it would devastate her.</p><p>As Colette climbed the stairs to her apartment, she found herself smiling, anticipating an evening with the woman she\u2019d come to admire on so brief an introduction. At this point, Elizabeth and Alix were the only people who knew about the baby. The other day, she\u2019d felt movement for the first time and was looking forward to sharing this news with Elizabeth.</p><p>Yesterday, Steve had phoned and left a message on her cell. Coward that she was, Colette hadn\u2019t returned his call. She would, though, and now, thanks to Elizabeth, she had a legitimate excuse to turn him down. She hoped he\u2019d figure out that she was no longer interested in seeing him. If she needed to spell it out, she would, but she\u2019d rather avoid a confrontation. It wasn\u2019t as if they\u2019d been dating seriously.</p><p>As she entered her apartment, Colette turned on the local news, a habit she\u2019d gotten into. The television was company in the evenings. Putting aside the mail as the news reader described a four-car pileup, she rummaged through the refrigerator, seeking inspiration for dinner. While she decided, she opened a container of yogurt and ate that, half listening to the news story. No fatalities in that highway accident, she was glad to hear.</p> <p>When her phone rang, she assumed it was Steve again. But caller ID didn\u2019t indicate a number and after hesitating only a moment, she reached for the receiver. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, half expecting some form of sales pitch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christian.\u201d</p><p>The immediate joy, mingled with dread, utterly confused her. He\u2019d promised not to have any contact with her and so far\u2014other than his note about Steve\u2014he\u2019d kept his word. He hadn\u2019t called or come to the shop in more than a month.</p><p>She\u2019d been relieved.</p><p>She\u2019d been disappointed.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t know what she felt for him anymore. She didn\u2019t want him in her life, and at the same time she dreamed about him nearly every night.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d She tried to sound disinterested and wondered if she\u2019d succeeded. She\u2019d rather Christian didn\u2019t suspect she was so thrilled to hear his voice. Yet that was the feeling that quickly overwhelmed every other reaction.</p><p>\u201cYour card came....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to know,\u201d he said with reluctance. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t part of our agreement, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d If he was guilty of breaking his word, she was equally guilty for being so pleased to hear from him. She\u2019d never admit that, though. \u201cHow did you learn about Steve?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you have him investigated?\u201d The real question was: Why would he?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied tersely. \u201cI know someone who used to be a friend of his.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Colette wasn\u2019t convinced she should believe him.</p><p>\u201cAre you still seeing Grisham?\u201d Christian demanded.</p><p>It was none of his business, and yet he might have saved her untold heartache. \u201cNo.\u201d She didn\u2019t offer any more explanation than that.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>The silence between them made her nervous. Finally, Christian asked, \u201cHow are you, Colette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very well.\u201d She wondered if he\u2019d called to find out about her and Steve. No, more likely something had happened. \u201cHave you...are you\u2014you know?\u201d She couldn\u2019t say it. She was afraid he was about to be arrested and had turned to her for some kind of help or perhaps comfort.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not in jail yet.\u201d</p><p>She was annoyed that he could joke about it, although he\u2019d provided the information she\u2019d been trying to find out. \u201cIs there a reason for your call?\u201d she asked curtly. Keeping an emotional distance was the only way she had of protecting herself.</p> <p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, there is. I understand you recently met my aunt Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>Colette was instantly defensive, not wanting him to know she\u2019d sought out the other woman. She probably should\u2019ve realized that Elizabeth would talk to Christian about her visit.</p><p>\u201cI delivered one of the weekly floral arrangements you ordered for her,\u201d Colette told him. She wasn\u2019t going to admit anything beyond that.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders were so tense, they ached.</p><p>\u201cMy aunt Elizabeth is pretty special, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really liked her.\u201d There was no point in denying it.</p><p>\u201cSo my suspicions were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Colette said. \u201cWhat suspicions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou received a dinner invitation from her, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Had Elizabeth told him about that, too?</p><p>\u201cBecause I also got one.\u201d</p><p>It had never occurred to Colette that Elizabeth had invited anyone else, least of all Christian.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve guessed,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cGuessed?\u201d she repeated irritably. \u201cGuessed what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you realize that my sweet, old-fashioned aunt is playing matchmaker,\u201d he explained. \u201cI received an invitation from her and she says she won\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you assume I was involved?\u201d Colette asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause my dear aunt has never insisted I come to dinner before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew something was up.\u201d He was far more perceptive than she\u2019d been and she felt a bit foolish, considering how easily Elizabeth had recognized her feelings for Christian.</p><p>\u201cShe made it fairly obvious,\u201d he said wryly.</p><p>\u201cHave you asked her about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and my aunt was uncharacteristically quiet. She did admit she\u2019d invited a \u2018special guest\u2019 and it was someone I already knew...very well.\u201d</p><p>Colette\u2019s face burned with embarrassment. His aunt had probably suggested Christian knew his dinner companion intimately. \u201cI see,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ll come up with some excuse to decline.\u201d</p><p>Instantly contrite, Colette felt she couldn\u2019t let him do that. \u201cNo, no. I\u2019ll decline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the offer, but it\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your aunt,\u201d Colette said. \u201cShe loves you. She\u2019s only doing this because she wants...well, she wants to see you\u2014\u201d Colette searched for the right word \u201c\u2014happy,\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Christian commented.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d She hated that the defensiveness was back in her voice.</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019d learn this much from a simple flower delivery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Colette\u2019s throat was suddenly dry. \u201cYes...She, uh, invited me in for tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you accepted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you told her?\u201d he asked pointedly.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to the ongoing investigation regarding your illegal activities,\u201d she said stiffly, \u201cthen the answer is no. I didn\u2019t breathe a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow could I? How could I break this lovely woman\u2019s heart?\u201d she blurted out. \u201cChristian, if for no other reason than your aunt, you need to get out of this.\u201d</p><p>His hesitation was brief, and when he spoke he sounded regretful. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I would if it were possible? I\u2019m sorry, Colette. I\u2019d give just about anything to turn back the clock. But it\u2019s too late now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off as if he\u2019d lost interest in the conversation. \u201cI suppose my dear aunt told you the story of my less-than-happy childhood?\u201d he asked.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t do any good to press the subject of his pending troubles, so she dropped it. \u201cSome,\u201d Colette admitted, instinctively realizing that he\u2019d hate her knowing about that part of his life.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d</p><p>Colette thought about the deep affection his aunt had for him. She yearned to tell him how grateful she was for that hour with Elizabeth. During their visit, she felt she\u2019d come to understand Christian in ways that would never have been possible otherwise.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt she bored you to death with stories of my love of maps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust how long were you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, long enough to let her think you and I were involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t! I promise.\u201d Colette had told his aunt about their one-night stand and the result. She\u2019d also said that they weren\u2019t seeing each other anymore; she\u2019d claimed\u2014convincingly, she\u2019d felt\u2014that it was for the best. Apparently, Aunt Elizabeth didn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>\u201cYou go to dinner with her,\u201d Christian said. \u201cI assure you, she\u2019ll enjoy visiting with you far more than she would me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Colette countered. She could see that this was quickly becoming a clash of wills. \u201cArguing is ridiculous. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s related to her, not me, so you should accept her invitation.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYes, I suppose it is ridiculous. Nevertheless, I gave you my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI absolve you from it for that one evening,\u201d she told him. She refused to be responsible for disappointing the older woman. \u201cWe\u2019ll both go to dinner and be done with it.\u201d</p><p>He considered her suggestion. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. It would only encourage her. Unless you\u2019ve had a change of heart.\u201d At her hesitation, he laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. No, it\u2019s better that we not have anything to do with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose it is,\u201d she answered sadly. Her instincts about Christian were accurate; it would\u2019ve been a mistake to tell him she was pregnant with his baby. A painful mistake.</p><p>\u201cGo to dinner with your aunt,\u201d she reiterated.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I will.\u201d</p><p>They left it at that, and a few minutes later, Colette closed her phone. Nothing had been decided. Not until the night of the dinner would she know whether or not Christian planned to go.</p><p>The next morning Colette woke feeling depressed. The baby fluttered within her womb and she pressed her hand against the slight bulge. She loved this child with a swell of emotion that produced unstoppable tears. For her own sake and the sake of the baby, she\u2019d keep her secret, but eventually Christian would need to know. She dreaded the day she\u2019d have to tell him and decided to wait as long as she could. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tuesday afternoon after work, when Colette met Alix at Go Figure, she casually brought up the conversation.</p><p>\u201cChristian phoned,\u201d she said as she stepped out of the dressing room. She\u2019d noticed a pack of cigarettes in Alix\u2019s open purse and wondered when her friend had taken up smoking. Maybe the cigarettes belonged to someone else, she told herself. She hoped so, anyway.</p><p>Alix stared at her with an intensity that made her squirm.</p><p>\u201cWe both heard from his aunt,\u201d Colette explained. The music pounded, fast-paced and energetic. She wanted to get started on their routine, but Alix wasn\u2019t budging. Colette regretted saying anything.</p> <p>\u201cHe wants to see you again, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Alix said triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Colette shook her head. \u201cLike I told you, we both received invitations to his aunt\u2019s for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going?\u201d</p><p>When Colette nodded, Alix immediately smiled. \u201cGood answer.\u201d</p><p>The music had a hypnotic effect on Colette as she threw herself into her exercise routine. All the while, she could feel Alix watching her, silently encouraging her to give Christian another chance\u2014give herself another chance. But Alix couldn\u2019t possibly understand that the situation was hopeless. And Colette couldn\u2019t tell her.</p> <p>Once they\u2019d finished, changed clothes and walked outside, Alix pulled out the pack of cigarettes and lit one up.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you start smoking?\u201d Colette asked, making an effort not to sound as disapproving as she felt.</p><p>\u201cSaturday.\u201d She inhaled deeply. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to smoke until after this wedding business is done. I\u2019ll quit then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Colette sighed. Then she realized she\u2019d been oblivious to Alix\u2019s problems. \u201cYou want a cup of coffee to go with that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t have time,\u201d Alix answered with a shrug, blowing out a stream of smoke.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been so absorbed in my own life that I wasn\u2019t paying attention to what\u2019s happening in yours.\u201d</p><p>With a shake of her head, Alix dismissed her concern. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s big enough for you to take up smoking, so clearly something\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet it hasn\u2019t,\u201d Alix said cryptically, then tossed the half-smoked cigarette on the sidewalk and squashed it with the toe of her boot. \u201cListen, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather not discuss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say.\u201d</p><p>Alix actually grinned then. \u201cThanks. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d Colette asked.</p> <p>Alix didn\u2019t look nearly as confident now. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cAsk me again next week.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>Alix Townsend</p><p>Alix woke feeling miserable, itchy and vaguely unwell. Scratching the inside of her elbow, she sat upright and switched on the bedside lamp. The alarm would go off in another ten minutes anyway, so there was no point in delaying the inevitable. The instant she turned on the light Alix knew her suspicions were correct.</p><p>Hives.</p><p>She\u2019d broken out in a full-blown case of hives. No one needed to tell her why, either. Stress over this damned wedding. Nothing had helped. Cigarettes certainly hadn\u2019t. Neither had avoiding the issue with Jordan. Or pretending she hadn\u2019t overheard Jacqueline talking to Susan. In fact, she couldn\u2019t think of any solution\u2014except one.</p><p>In eighteen months on the job, not once had Alix phoned in sick. Even now, with her arms swollen and her face blotchy, she hated doing it. Not showing up, especially at the last minute like this, was a hardship on everyone. Alix took her responsibilities seriously. Reluctantly she picked up her phone. After making the call she swallowed two antihistamine tablets and went back to bed.</p><p>Thankfully, they made her sleepy, and when she woke again, she felt a little better. She took a shower, slathered on some calamine lotion and put on loose jeans and an old T-shirt. Then she caught the bus to Blossom Street. Only she didn\u2019t stop at the French Caf\u00e9. Instead, she walked over to the Free Methodist Church, where she knew she\u2019d find Jordan.</p><p>When she arrived, he was on the phone in his office. His eyes widened when she came into view. Alix couldn\u2019t tell if his reaction was simply one of surprise or of shock at her appearance\u2014the swollen face with its red blotches and the calamine-pink streaks on her throat and arms. Cute, very cute.</p><p>He ended the conversation quickly and Alix made herself comfortable. Or as comfortable as someone with hives could be. She slouched in the chair across from his desk, trying not to move any more than necessary.</p><p>\u201cAlix, what are you doing here?\u201d Before she could answer, he asked anxiously, \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it look like I\u2019m all right?\u201d she fired back. \u201cI\u2019ve got hives.\u201d</p><p>His concern was immediate. \u201cHave you made a doctor\u2019s appointment?\u201d</p><p>She knew from past experience that medical help could only address the symptoms. \u201cNo doctor can do anything for me.\u201d Even with her jacket on, she couldn\u2019t resist scratching. With a determined effort she stopped.</p><p>\u201cNerves?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>Alix tried hard not to let him know how close to the edge she was but didn\u2019t quite succeed. \u201cSomething like that,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou need to relax.\u201d He reached absently for his coffee mug, which stood by the telephone. \u201cAnything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, there is.\u201d</p><p>Apparently her answer surprised him, because his gaze shot to hers. \u201cName it.\u201d</p><p>This was the opening she\u2019d been waiting for. \u201cCancel the big fancy wedding,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cLet\u2019s go away and just get married. It wouldn\u2019t be an elopement, but it wouldn\u2019t involve all these strangers. The only people we need are family and a few friends. Can we do that, Jordan? Can we end this craziness and have a simple, private wedding? Please?\u201d she added, staring intently at him.</p><p>Jordan frowned. \u201cYou want to cancel the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe big fancy affair and replace it with a small sane one.\u201d The itch was too severe to ignore and she tore into her thigh, scratching relentlessly through her jeans.</p><p>Her fianc\u00e9\u2019s shoulders sagged with what could only be described as disappointment. \u201cAlix, we\u2019ve already had this discussion, remember? We can\u2019t change everything at the last minute. It\u2019d be too difficult and cause a lot of hard feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know it\u2019s the last minute?\u201d she cried. Today was May first; the wedding was in exactly four weeks and one day. She was well aware of what backing out would mean. The invitations had been mailed; people had started sending gifts. Alix hadn\u2019t seen any of them yet, but Jordan had told her about the pile accumulating at his parents\u2019 home.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re feeling nervous,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d she cried, holding out her arms, although her jean jacket prevented him from seeing much. \u201cI\u2019ve got hives from head to foot. And there\u2019s something else I didn\u2019t tell you about earlier, because you\u2019d get mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething else? What?\u201d he asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI started smoking again.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s eyes widened, but to his credit he held his tongue. \u201cDid it help?\u201d</p><p>She held out her arms again for his inspection; her sleeves slid up, revealing the red welts and the streaks of pink lotion. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cGuess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI threw away that pack of cigarettes this morning, which probably wasn\u2019t the best idea.\u201d Still, Alix figured she might as well quit now. With the price of cigarettes, she couldn\u2019t afford them anyway.</p><p>\u201cAlix, it\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d Jordan murmured. \u201cThe wedding will be fine, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, she knew otherwise. But the problem wasn\u2019t just the wedding and everyone else taking control. It was also the man she was about to marry. He hadn\u2019t listened. He kept pushing her away, putting her off, discounting her concerns. Much as Alix loved him, much as she wanted to be part of his life, she was beginning to realize that marrying him was a mistake.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t our wedding anymore. It never has been. Your mother and Jacqueline have turned it into a...a circus. I know they mean well and I appreciate their efforts, I really do.\u201d She struggled to explain how trapped she felt. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to pretend everything would be fine. I wanted to do this for you and your family and for Jacqueline and Reese, too. But I can\u2019t go through with the wedding as it stands. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that!\u201d</p><p>Her throat tightened and her eyes stung with tears. She swallowed painfully. Her voice was choked, hoarse, when she spoke again. \u201cIt\u2019s far too important to you to make everyone else happy, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid it is.\u201d She looked sadly down at her hands and then removed the diamond from her finger. For an instant she closed her hand around it, wanting to hold on to it a moment longer.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d Jordan said, and he sounded almost as if he were laughing, as if he thought this was all some practical joke.</p><p>Alix set the diamond ring on the corner of his desk.</p><p>\u201cAlix, listen to me. Every bride goes through these prewedding jitters. It\u2019s normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese hives aren\u2019t normal. Jordan...\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I want more in this world than to be your wife, but I can\u2019t become someone I\u2019m not. I can\u2019t marry a man who\u2019s so willing to ignore me and listen to what everyone else wants.\u201d</p><p>Jordan frowned at the ring. \u201cYou\u2019re actually calling it off?\u201d</p><p>Her throat constricted again; unable to speak, she simply nodded.</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>She gave another nod.</p><p>He stood and leaned forward, placing his hands on the edge of his desk. \u201cFine. You want out. That\u2019s wonderful news. Just what am I supposed to tell everyone?\u201d</p><p>That was all Jordan cared about? What other people thought? Alix would have answered him but the pain in her throat made speaking impossible. When she turned to walk away, Jordan stretched out his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cWe need to talk this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to say,\u201d she whispered, watching as he reached across his desk for the ring. He held it between his thumb and finger and stared down at it in disbelief, as if the diamond could explain what had gone wrong.</p><p>\u201cYour mother had me pegged from the first,\u201d Alix said. She wanted Jordan to know she was aware of Susan\u2019s feelings toward her. \u201cI\u2019m not the right kind of woman for you. I never have been and I was a fool to believe otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Jordan gaped at her.</p><p>\u201cApparently you hadn\u2019t noticed, but your family did,\u201d Alix continued. \u201cI\u2019m really not good church material, either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s...that\u2019s absurd,\u201d he stammered.</p><p>Alix felt he was the absurd one, thinking she could change who she was, wipe out her past and play the role of pastor\u2019s wife. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. More than anything, I wish I could be the woman you and everyone else want me to be. I tried, but it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious, then? It isn\u2019t just the wedding you\u2019re calling off, it\u2019s the whole marriage?\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a ploy or a trick to get him to change his mind about the wedding and do it her way. He\u2019d summarized the situation clearly. She couldn\u2019t marry him. She\u2019d let her love cloud her feelings, confuse her actions. She\u2019d realized, while scratching the skin off her arms, that Jordan hadn\u2019t listened to her. He thought he had, assumed he\u2019d allayed her fears. Because she\u2019d wanted to believe him, she\u2019d allowed his confidence to momentarily reassure her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d he asked. He gestured weakly, then let his arms fall to his sides.</p><p>Alix shook her head and shoved her hands in her pockets for fear she\u2019d start scratching again. \u201cYour mother will know the proper protocol,\u201d she told him.</p><p>His mouth thinned, and Alix could tell that the prospect of facing his mother displeased him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think canceling the wedding\u2019s going to be that much of a problem. Don\u2019t worry. Your family will smooth everything over.\u201d With these words, she walked out of his office.</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t come after her.</p> <p>Alix got on the bus and rode around for a long time, lost in her misery. On impulse she changed buses and went out to Sea-Tac Airport, then walked to nearby Star Lake, where Jordan\u2019s grandmother, Sarah Turner, lived. With the wedding officially canceled, Alix didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever see her again. The prayer shawl was finished and she wanted to give it to Sarah. Unfortunately she didn\u2019t have it with her.</p><p>It was quite a hike from the road to the residential area around the lake, but the physical exertion made Alix feel better.</p><p>She recognized the house from her visit at Christmas and the time she and Jordan had gone in January. She walked down the dusty driveway and discovered Grandma Turner busy working in her yard. The old woman held a large watering can and wore coveralls and rubber boots, her thick white hair tied back with a red-and-blue bandanna. She straightened when she saw Alix.</p><p>\u201cHello, Grandma,\u201d Alix said, although she knew it was presumptuous to address Pastor Turner\u2019s mother as Grandma, since Alix was no longer going to be part of the family.</p><p>\u201cAlix? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jordan?\u201d</p><p>Alix shrugged. \u201cWork, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Grandma set the watering can aside and clumped over to the house to turn off the faucet. \u201cWell, come inside and have a glass of iced tea. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d Her welcome was so warm, it almost brought Alix to tears.</p><p>Obediently Alix followed her to the house.</p><p>\u201cI was watering my garden and tending the rhododendrons,\u201d Sarah said as she removed her boots, lining them up on the back steps. \u201cThey\u2019re gorgeous this year. Did you notice?\u201d</p><p>Alix barely heard her. She stood in the doorway, hands in her pockets, and knew she had to say something, had to explain. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Grandma Turner said briskly. As if to prove her point, she took two glasses from the kitchen cupboard.</p><p>Alix stepped inside and breathed in the simple beauty around her\u2014the scarred oak table, scrubbed clean, the pots of herbs, the handwoven curtains and braided rug. She loved this house and she loved Jordan\u2019s grandmother. To her horror, she began to cry.</p> <p>Sniff ling, she ran her sleeve under her nose. \u201cI...wanted to tell you I knit you a shawl.\u201d Somehow she managed to get the words out but she didn\u2019t know if they were even intelligible.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s grandmother turned to squint at her. \u201cWhere\u2019d I put my eyeglasses?\u201d She started moving things on the table in a fruitless search. \u201cI hear better with my glasses on.\u201d</p><p>Despite her misery, Alix grinned. Seeing them on the counter, she walked farther into the kitchen and handed them to the old woman. Grandma Turner slid them on, then looked at her and frowned.</p><p>Alix wiped her nose again. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was ever going to see you again,\u201d she said. \u201cI came to say thank you and to tell you goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye? Aren\u2019t you marrying\u2014\u201d Grandma stopped abruptly, her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be a wedding,\u201d Alix told her, refusing to lay blame or offer elaborate explanations. Grandma Turner would hear all about it soon enough.</p><p>The old woman pulled out a kitchen chair, sat down and sighed. \u201cNo wedding. Now, that\u2019s a crying shame. I like you, Alix. You\u2019re exactly what this family needs.\u201d</p><p>Alix desperately wished that was true.</p><p>\u201cTalk about a bunch of stuffed shirts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma!\u201d</p><p>Sarah Turner sipped her iced tea, then patted Alix\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t...know where else to go.\u201d Even now, Alix wasn\u2019t sure what had drawn her to the old woman. Telling her about the shawl was only an excuse.</p><p>\u201cYou came to exactly the right place,\u201d Grandma Turner assured her.</p><p>Alix choked on a sob. \u201cI gotta leave.\u201d The old lady didn\u2019t need her blubbering all over the kitchen. Besides, Alix wasn\u2019t in the mood to sit around and exchange polite chitchat.</p><p>\u201cDid I ever tell you about Jordan\u2019s grandfather and me?\u201d Grandma Turner asked. \u201cBefore we got married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Grandma passed her a box of tissues.</p><p>\u201cThe Turner family didn\u2019t think I was the girl for him.\u201d</p><p>Alix found that hard to believe.</p><p>\u201cAs you know, I worked back in the days when it was rare for a woman to hold a job outside the home. The Turner family was in the ministry and disapproved of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did marry him,\u201d Alix said, dabbing at her eyes. She hated showing any kind of weakness.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did\u2014because Lawrence stood up to his family and insisted he loved me. I remember him talking to his parents as firm as could be. He said he was well past the age of consent, well past letting them make his decisions for him. If they couldn\u2019t see the blessings I brought to the family, then they needed to open their eyes.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Turner thought she was helping, but the old woman didn\u2019t realize how badly her words hurt. Jordan would never do that for Alix. In fact, he seemed almost relieved about canceling the wedding. What worried him most was facing his mother and telling her the whole thing was off. Alix loved Jordan, but it had become obvious that she wasn\u2019t the right woman for him\u2014and that he wasn\u2019t the right man for her.</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>\u201cWhy do people who love to knit complain about knitting a row with 1200 stitches and not about knitting 20 rows with 60 stitches?\u201d</p><p>Candace Eisner Strick, author of Sweaters From a New England Village (Down East Books, 1996), Beyond Wool (Martingale Books, 2004) and Knit One, Stripe Too (Martingale Books, 2007)</p><p>Lydia Goetz</p><p>I was now standing guard over Margaret, and that was a real switch. From my teen years onward, I was the coddled one, fragile and sickly, and as a result, I developed the troubling habit of waiting for others to step in and take care of me. That didn\u2019t change until my life finally stopped revolving around my needs, my desires\u2014which happened when I opened the yarn store three years ago.</p><p>I\u2019ve learned such valuable lessons about running a business and coping with people and making decisions. And that included everything going on in our family. I\u2019d become my sister\u2019s protector, and one manifestation of that was shielding her as much as possible from what was going on with Mom. Margaret had enough to deal with in taking care of Julia\u2014and herself.</p><p>Because of this, Margaret was taking a lot of time off work. I let her go as often as she felt necessary, which wasn\u2019t easy for me. Some days I didn\u2019t even get a lunch break. It was one customer after another until the end of the day. Thankfully, I loved what I was doing! I still love it.</p><p>This Wednesday morning in early May was unusual\u2014because Margaret had nothing to say. My sister\u2019s always been quick to share her opinions, wanted or not. She showed up for work and hardly said a word. Questions hovered on the tip of my tongue. I knew Julia had joined a support group for crime victims\u2014which I\u2019d learned from Hailey.</p><p>At first it irritated me that my own sister hadn\u2019t given me this latest update. But vocal as she is, especially about other people\u2019s actions, Margaret can be intensely private about her own life and affairs. I supposed she would eventually have mentioned this counseling group of Julia\u2019s; at least I hoped so.</p><p>As if she\u2019d been reading my thoughts, Margaret approached me where I was taking inventory. This particular wool was one of my favorite brands and it felted beautifully. I could hardly keep it on the shelves. The key is choosing the right colors and with hundreds of choices from which to select, I\u2019d been experimenting, bringing in new shades.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need time off this afternoon,\u201d Margaret announced bluntly. \u201cThat isn\u2019t a problem, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the shawl class,\u201d I reminded her. I counted on my sister to be there in case customers stopped by.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but this is important.\u201d I heard the defensiveness in her voice.</p><p>I bit off the words asking my sister how much longer she\u2019d be requiring time away from work. \u201cI\u2019ll manage,\u201d I told her, although I didn\u2019t look forward to running the class while waiting on customers.</p><p>Margaret\u2019s reluctance to explain worried me. At one point she\u2019d talked about hiring a private detective, but if she\u2019d done so, I wasn\u2019t aware of it. I hoped\u2014trusted\u2014that Matt had talked her out of it.</p><p>After an interminable pause, Margaret answered my unspoken question. \u201cJulia\u2019s going into police headquarters at three to identify the defendant in a lineup,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe police caught him?\u201d You\u2019d think Margaret would\u2019ve said something!</p><p>\u201cDetective Johnson believes this is the one,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s in a lineup so Julia can get a good look at him.\u201d</p><p>My immediate concern was for my niece and how she\u2019d react to seeing her attacker again. \u201cHow\u2019s she handling that?\u201d</p><p>Margaret didn\u2019t betray her feelings easily; nevertheless, I could see she was nervous. \u201cMatt and I talked to her this morning. We told her the suspect\u2014\u201d she spat out the word \u201c\u2014can\u2019t hurt her again. I assume he\u2019s already behind bars.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t tell my sister that just because he\u2019d been brought in for a lineup didn\u2019t necessarily mean he was in jail. Of course, everything I knew about police procedure I\u2019d learned on Law &amp; Order. I did realize that a lot depended on Julia\u2019s ability to make a positive identification. Then and only then would the suspect be charged.</p><p>\u201cJulia\u2019s stronger now than at any time since the attack,\u201d Margaret went on. \u201cMatt and I are going with her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d I asked, grateful that my sister and brother-in-law would be with my niece. I wanted to help Margaret through this crisis, but felt powerless to do anything more than give her the time off she needed.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI appreciate your being so understanding about all of this,\u201d she said brusquely.</p><p>I didn\u2019t let on how perturbed I\u2019d been earlier. I certainly would\u2019ve liked more notice but guessed she hadn\u2019t been given much herself. And her acknowledgement, her thanks, meant a great deal to me. \u201cYou\u2019ll call and tell me what happened, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Margaret nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll call you from the police station.\u201d</p> <p>By the time the members of my class started to arrive, Margaret was gone for the day. Alix didn\u2019t show up, which surprised me. I\u2019d never known her to miss a class. I was sorry she wouldn\u2019t be joining us; her presence always made our knitting sessions livelier.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to Alix since last week,\u201d Colette told me.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cBut last time we met, Alix was almost finished with her shawl.\u201d</p><p>I remembered that, too. In fact, she\u2019d purchased yarn for another project, a felted purse. Still, it wasn\u2019t like Alix to stay away, even if she\u2019d completed a project. My guess was that wedding plans were keeping her extra busy.</p><p>\u201cI read an article about people knitting with wire,\u201d Susannah commented as she sat down at the table and brought out her knitting. After a slow start, she\u2019d done well with the shawl.</p> <p>I\u2019d heard of wire-knitting, too. \u201cI guess some people get desperate to knit,\u201d I said, trying to be funny. \u201cSome poor knitter was probably stuck somewhere without a yarn store and broke into her husband\u2019s tool kit.\u201d</p><p>Colette didn\u2019t laugh the way I\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, though, I\u2019ve seen some lovely jewelry made with gold wire,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Colette finally looked up from her knitting. Her own shawl was coming along, though not at any great speed. I\u2019d hoped she\u2019d be nearly finished by now. Next week was our final class and she had more than half the shawl yet to knit.</p><p>\u201cAnyone heard from Alix in the last few days?\u201d Colette asked a moment later.</p><p>She seemed concerned suddenly, although when I\u2019d first mentioned Alix I hadn\u2019t sensed any uneasiness in her.</p> <p>\u201cCome to think of it, I haven\u2019t seen her in a while,\u201d I said slowly. Alix usually dropped in two or three times a week. She\u2019d long been more than a customer; we were friends.</p><p>Friends. And then it hit me. \u201cYou know what we need to do, don\u2019t you?\u201d I said in a rush, wondering why I hadn\u2019t thought of it earlier. \u201cWe should hold a wedding shower for Alix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea,\u201d Colette agreed. \u201cJust us\u2014her knitting friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about next Wednesday, since that\u2019s our last class,\u201d Susannah suggested.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThat would be perfect. We\u2019ll make it a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Everyone agreed enthusiastically. We discussed knitting-related gifts\u2014pattern books, yarn in a color we knew she liked, a gift certificate for the shop.</p><p>\u201cWe could order a cake from the French Caf\u00e9,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cAlix might even end up decorating her own cake.\u201d</p><p>We all found that amusing, especially in light of the problems she\u2019d had over her wedding cake. She\u2019d talked about it one afternoon when she\u2019d come by for yarn. She\u2019d sounded depressed about the decision Jacqueline and Susan had made regarding it. I tended to side with Alix, but not wanting to cause any discord, I said nothing to her or to Jacqueline.</p> <p>\u201cHas anyone else planned a shower for her?\u201d I asked, certain there must be others.</p><p>\u201cTammie Lee Donovan,\u201d Colette said. \u201cAlix brought it up the last time we worked out at Go Figure.\u201d</p><p>That made sense. Jacqueline\u2019s daughter-in-law was a good friend of Alix\u2019s. And I recalled that Jacqueline had, in fact, mentioned the shower. Tammie Lee had invited all their friends from the country club, where both couples were prominent members.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t seem that excited about it,\u201d Colette added.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she knows a lot of the women who frequent the country club,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s probably feeling a bit apprehensive.\u201d</p><p>Colette\u2019s mouth turned down in a sympathetic grimace. \u201cYeah. She\u2019s afraid she\u2019ll be out of her element.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another shower being held by the ladies at the Free Methodist Church the week before the wedding,\u201d Susannah said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt would be if it were someone other than Alix,\u201d Colette said.</p><p>\u201cIs she uncomfortable about this one, too?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>Colette hesitated. \u201cThat might be an overstatement. But she seemed kind of shocked people would do that for her. I think she\u2019s afraid she might forget someone\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>That was a problem I could easily identify with. A lot of people come to my shop, and while I make an effort to remember all their names, I sometimes forget. It\u2019s embarrassing to admit, especially when they\u2019ve been to A Good Yarn a few times.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like Alix to miss our workout sessions,\u201d Colette said. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t gone together since last week. She\u2019s not answering her phone and she wasn\u2019t at work today.\u201d</p><p>I was beginning to feel worried, even a little scared.</p><p>The bell above the door chimed then, and in walked Jacqueline Donovan. She marched purposely toward the back of the store, where the rest of the class had gathered. And she looked...unlike Jacqueline. Her hair was actually disheveled, her mascara smudged and her raincoat badly wrinkled. Appearances are important to Jacqueline, and I\u2019d never seen her like this before.</p><p>She glanced at the table and her shoulders sagged. \u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, but I could guess. She was searching for Alix.</p><p>Her next words confirmed it. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time any of you saw Alix?\u201d she asked.</p><p>We all looked at one another. \u201cLast week for me,\u201d Colette admitted. \u201cWe were talking about her just now, wondering where she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from her?\u201d Jacqueline demanded, turning to me.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014not recently. Has anything happened?\u201d I was convinced there must be something seriously wrong for Jacqueline to leave her house with less than a full application of cosmetics and several pieces of expensive jewelry, not to mention a perfectly pressed coat.</p><p>Jacqueline seemed indecisive, then shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d was all she\u2019d tell me. She remained stubbornly tight-lipped. If anyone had an opportunity to talk to Alix, it would be Jacqueline, since Alix lived in the Donovans\u2019 guesthouse. Surely Jacqueline needed only to cross the lawn and knock on the door. This told me Alix hadn\u2019t been home. And that meant trouble.</p><p>\u201cIf you see her,\u201d Jacqueline said urgently, \u201cpromise you\u2019ll get her to phone me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d That would be an easy promise to keep. I was truly worried now, without knowing exactly why.</p><p>Jacqueline left and as soon as the door closed, the three of us exchanged anxious looks.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m really wondering what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Susannah muttered, stopping long enough to count the stitches on her needle.</p><p>\u201cMaybe holding a wedding shower isn\u2019t such a good idea, after all,\u201d Colette began.</p><p>Before I could respond, the phone rang. I hurried over to the counter, hoping the caller would be either Margaret or Alix. It was Margaret.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Danny Chesterfield,\u201d my sister said.</p><p>It sounded like a nice name, the name of someone pleasant, an upstanding citizen, not a hardened criminal.</p><p>\u201cDanny Chesterfield,\u201d I repeated slowly. \u201cDid Julia recognize him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away,\u201d Margaret told me with a hint of pride. \u201cAs soon as they marched the men into the room, Julia grabbed my hand.\u201d</p><p>I wish I could\u2019ve been there to reassure Julia, too.</p><p>\u201cShe called out Danny\u2019s number even before all the men turned to face us.\u201d Margaret snickered derisively. \u201cAnd guess what\u2014first thing he did was get a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>Of course he would.</p><p>\u201cDetective Johnson says he belongs to a gang of car thieves that target certain cars. Apparently, Danny\u2019s been in enough trouble through the years that there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll get off lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Like my sister, I wanted this criminal behind bars, the sooner, the better.</p><p>\u201cI can already see a difference in Julia,\u201d my sister told me. Margaret sounded more carefree than she had in weeks.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she now?\u201d I asked, hoping to talk to her, if only for a minute. It couldn\u2019t have been easy to confront this felon. Even though he couldn\u2019t see her behind the glass, Julia saw him and with his face in full view, she would\u2019ve felt the terror and helplessness all over again. I was proud of what she\u2019d done and wanted her to know it.</p><p>\u201cShe went over to a friend\u2019s house,\u201d Margaret announced triumphantly.</p><p>I wondered why my sister\u2019s tone held such a note of pride\u2014and then it came to me. Since the carjacking, Julia had refused to get behind the wheel of a car.</p><p>\u201cJulia drove?\u201d I asked breathlessly.</p><p>Margaret, who so rarely laughs, did. \u201cYes. By herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Margaret, that\u2019s fabulous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d she said soberly. \u201cAt last this nightmare is over.\u201d</p><p>I prayed my sister was right.</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>Colette Blake</p><p>Susannah had a doctor\u2019s appointment, so Colette was opening the flower shop on her own Friday morning. As she approached the alley doorway, she noticed someone squatting there, puffing away on a cigarette. A plume of smoke rose from the hunched figure.</p><p>\u201cAlix?\u201d Colette couldn\u2019t keep the relief out of her voice. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>Slowly Alix Townsend rose to a standing position, then dropped the cigarette and ground it out. Colette was filled with questions. Everyone had been talking about Alix and no one seemed to know where she\u2019d been for the past four days.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here in the alley?\u201d Colette asked, unlocking the door.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d Alix said gruffly and followed Colette into the back of the shop.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you,\u201d Colette told her, ignoring her rudeness. She flipped on the lights and punched in the code to shut off the alarm. Walking to the front of the shop, she turned over the Closed sign. Susannah liked to prop open the door, which she saw as an invitation for customers to come in and browse. Her \u201copen-door policy\u201d had been successful, too; equally enticing were the buckets of fresh flowers she arranged along the sidewalk.</p><p>Colette left the door open; she would set everything up when she\u2019d finished talking to Alix. This was going to be a busy day for her. After work, she\u2019d be joining Christian and his aunt for dinner. Although she was reluctant to admit it, Colette was looking forward to the evening. It\u2019d been more than a month since she\u2019d seen Christian and despite everything, she craved the sight of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up? Is there anything I can do for you?\u201d Colette asked, but what she really wanted to know was where Alix had been and why. Her friend looked as if she hadn\u2019t slept in a week. The smudges under her eyes spoke of misery and exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cI came to cancel the wedding flowers,\u201d Alix said abruptly.</p><p>This was a shock, but Colette tried not to show it. \u201cAre you changing the order?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr canceling it altogether?\u201d</p><p>Alix\u2019s eyes were shadowed. \u201cCanceling.\u201d</p> <p>Susannah would be disappointed. The Turner wedding was a huge order and had come with a substantial down payment. Although she\u2019d hold a certain amount back, it would still be a loss.</p><p>\u201cSo you and Jordan have decided to call off the wedding?\u201d Colette asked, finding this hard to believe. Colette knew how much Alix loved him. In fact, Colette envied her friend the close relationship she had with her fianc\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cAs of last Tuesday, the wedding\u2019s officially off,\u201d Alix said blandly. Colette stared at her. Despite Alix\u2019s no-big-deal attitude, this must be ripping her heart out. It also explained why no one had seen her all week. Colette noticed that Alix\u2019s hands were shaking, although she tried to hide it by shoving them in her pockets.</p><p>\u201cThe paperwork\u2019s in the office,\u201d Colette said in a noncommittal tone. She led Alix there, out of view of anyone who might be looking in the shop windows. As soon as they were alone, she breathed, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Alix tried unsuccessfully to pretend it was a small thing. \u201cJordan and I agreed it was for the best, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Alix, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d she said, rejecting Colette\u2019s sympathy. \u201cAnyone looking at the two of us could see it was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Colette didn\u2019t buy that for a minute.</p><p>\u201cI was living in a fool\u2019s paradise,\u201d Alix went on. She climbed up on a stool while Colette prepared a pot of coffee. After a few minutes, the rich, tantalizing scent drifted through the small office.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the right woman to be a pastor\u2019s wife,\u201d Alix said. \u201cThank goodness I recognized that before it was too late.\u201d</p><p>Colette was stunned. \u201cBut...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disappear,\u201d Alix was saying.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d</p><p>Alix stared down at the hardwood floor. \u201cI took a few vacation days and went to see a...family friend. Then, yesterday afternoon, I started looking for someplace to move. I applied for a few other jobs, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>When Alix glanced up again, Colette winced at the pain in her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t stay around this neighborhood with Jordan here. It would hurt too much to see him nearly every day and I would, you know.\u201d</p><p>That was true enough. Colette had run into Jordan at the French Caf\u00e9 a number of times. Even if he and Alix made an effort to avoid each other, it would be almost impossible.</p><p>\u201cI figure I need to get away from here,\u201d Alix concluded.</p><p>Colette felt like weeping. Alix was her friend, one of the best she\u2019d ever had, and couldn\u2019t stand the thought of losing her. Trying to remain calm\u2014or at least appear that way\u2014Colette leaned casually against the side of the desk, hands behind her, ankles crossed. \u201cYou and Christian\u2019s aunt are the only people I\u2019ve told about the baby,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd do you know why that is?\u201d</p> <p>Alix met her gaze and after a moment shrugged. \u201cYou and I work out together\u2014or we used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colette said flatly. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t judge me. In fact, you told me that yourself, and you were right. I could talk to you when I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone else. You listened to me. You cared and you didn\u2019t make me feel guilty or stupid.\u201d</p><p>Alix bowed her head. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered and her voice cracked with pain. \u201cThat means a lot to me. But the wedding is off. Jordan and I agreed a few days ago to cancel everything. The only reason I\u2019m here now is to take care of business before I find a new job and someplace else to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Jacqueline know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to the Donovans yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you decided where you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cbut that\u2019s not a problem. As a kid I changed neighborhoods more often than a moving van.\u201d</p><p>Colette dredged up the energy to smile. So Alix was going to run away. Well, she\u2019d been on the run, too. And what she\u2019d learned in the last months was that the person she was running from was herself. Not Christian, not her circumstances, but herself.</p><p>Alix was quiet for several minutes. \u201cSusan doesn\u2019t think I\u2019d make Jordan a good wife and she should know.\u201d Alix tried to make it sound like a joke, but Colette wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cYou have to admit she\u2019s more of an expert on this than either Jordan or me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree.\u201d Colette rested her hands on her hips, struggling not to reveal her irritation. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand how comfortable you make people feel?\u201d she asked. She turned around and grabbed two mugs from the shelf. She filled them with coffee, handing one to Alix. \u201cYou\u2019re the perfect wife for Jordan and if he hasn\u2019t figured that out, he isn\u2019t half the man I thought he was.\u201d</p><p>Tears glistened in Alix\u2019s eyes as she cradled the steaming mug. \u201cYou\u2019re a good friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be shocked if Jordan lets you leave the neighborhood. He\u2019s smart enough to know what he has.\u201d</p><p>Alix put her coffee down on a nearby worktable and sniffed. \u201cI wish that was true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlix, are you here?\u201d</p><p>The sound of Jordan\u2019s voice obviously shocked Alix and she slipped off the stool. Eyes wide, she cast a pleading look at Colette.</p><p>\u201cAlix!\u201d he repeated.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond, Colette stepped out of the office. \u201cShe\u2019s in here.\u201d If Alix looked unkempt, it was nothing compared to Jordan. He must\u2019ve slept in his clothes, because everything he had on was a mass of wrinkles. He hadn\u2019t shaved in days, and his hair stood on end.</p><p>Jordan entered the small office, standing squarely in the doorway. Alix realized she was trapped and Colette saw the panic cross her face.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know I was here?\u201d Alix demanded, her voice angry and defensive.</p><p>\u201cA friend of mine saw you. He came to get me,\u201d Jordan told her.</p><p>Alix had backed all the way up against the wall.</p><p>\u201cAlix!\u201d Jordan\u2019s entire body sagged in relief. \u201cAlix, for the love of heaven, where did you go? I\u2019ve been sick with worry. I called everyone I could think of.... I didn\u2019t know what to do when I couldn\u2019t find you. No one\u2014not even Jacqueline or the people at the caf\u00e9\u2014knew where you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent a few days at your grandma Turner\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma\u2019s?\u201d He seemed bewildered; clearly it had never occurred to him to call his own grandmother.</p><p>Colette felt like an unwanted third party and would gladly have left the room if Jordan hadn\u2019t blocked the entrance.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you went?\u201d Jordan shook his head. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love your grandmother,\u201d Alix said.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Jordan told her. \u201cAlix, I can\u2019t let you walk out of my life. I\u2019d be the biggest fool who ever lived if I did. You tried to tell me how unhappy you were, only I wasn\u2019t listening. I thought...Oh, I don\u2019t know what I thought. The wedding\u2019s nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing. You\u2019re all that matters. You don\u2019t want the big wedding, then it\u2019s out. Done with, canceled, forgotten. If you want a small ceremony with family and a few friends, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll have. But please marry me. I need you.\u201d</p><p>Alix remained rigid, frowning as if she didn\u2019t believe him.</p><p>Colette wanted to give her a shove in Jordan\u2019s direction. But Alix stood exactly where she was.</p><p>Jordan removed the diamond ring from his pocket and held it out to her. \u201cLet me put this back where it belongs\u2014on your finger. Just like you belong with me, and I belong with you.\u201d</p><p>Colette could feel Alix weakening as she looked down at her left hand. \u201cYou need to listen to me,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cI will, as God is my witness,\u201d he vowed.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d like to be married by the lake on your grandmother\u2019s poperty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can be arranged,\u201d Jordan said immediately.</p><p>\u201cWith your family and a few of our friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>Alix frowned again, as though she felt he\u2019d given in too easily and she wasn\u2019t sure she could trust him.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s more important to me than being with you,\u201d Jordan whispered.</p><p>Tears flowed down Alix\u2019s cheeks then, and she moved slowly toward Jordan. A second later they were locked in a fervent embrace.</p><p>Colette wanted to give them some privacy. Making her way past Jordan and Alix, she tiptoed out of the office, closing the door. She felt happier just knowing they were back together. However, Colette didn\u2019t envy them the task of breaking the news to Jacqueline and Susan Turner. She was certain they\u2019d be delighted the wedding was on, but less pleased about the kind of event it was going to be.</p><p>That morning\u2019s encounter left Colette in a melancholy mood for the rest of the day. The satisfaction she felt for them seemed to emphasize the bleakness of her own life. She was eager to see Elizabeth\u2014and to be with Christian, although there was virtually no chance of a happy resolution there.</p><p>The dinner invitation said she should arrive at six. Colette was ready much earlier than that, but she trotted down the stairs to her car with only ten minutes to spare. She drove to the house on Capitol Hill and was struck again by the beauty of the stately home with its white pillars and sweeping grounds. She noticed immediately that Christian\u2019s car was nowhere in sight. She\u2019d hoped to time her arrival so he\u2019d already be there.</p><p>The same woman, Doris, who\u2019d answered the door previously did so this evening. \u201cMiss Elizabeth is waiting in the library,\u201d she told Colette.</p><p>It all sounded very formal. Colette was led to the other room and sure enough, Christian\u2019s aunt was sipping tea by the fireplace. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you decided to accept my invitation,\u201d Elizabeth Sasser said, rising awkwardly to her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou also invited Christian,\u201d Colette said in a gently chiding voice.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d his aunt agreed. Her eyebrows rose in an expression Colette couldn\u2019t quite decipher.</p><p>\u201cYou decided to play the role of matchmaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d thought...Well, it\u2019s neither here nor there. Christian declined.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said he would but Colette had hoped he\u2019d change his mind. She was overcome by a deep sense of disappointment, which she tried to conceal. She assumed she\u2019d succeeded until she caught a look in the old woman\u2019s clear blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try again on another occasion,\u201d Elizabeth said matter-of-factly. \u201cAnd next time I\u2019ll be more clever about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colette laughed and slipped her arm through the other woman\u2019s. Together they walked slowly into the formal dining room, where the table was set with the finest china and crystal. Everything looked flawless and yet to Colette it seemed incomplete without Christian.</p><p>\u201cSit down, my dear,\u201d Elizabeth said.</p><p>Colette took her seat.</p><p>\u201cI brought out some photographs you might like to see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf your travels?\u201d Colette asked.</p><p>Elizabeth smiled as Doris came into the room, carrying two lovely salads, heaped with fresh scallops, shrimp and large chunks of Dungeness crab. \u201cNo, not my travels, although Charles and I did enjoy seeing the world. We had wonderful adventures....\u201d Her face softened for a moment, as if she\u2019d forgotten where she was. Then she roused herself. \u201cThese pictures are of Christian as a youngster.\u201d</p><p>Colette rested her hands in her lap and it took her pulse a moment to return to normal. Even then, she couldn\u2019t entirely trust her voice. \u201cI\u2019d enjoy that very much.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth raised her eyes to Colette\u2019s. \u201cI thought you would.\u201d With a mischievous smile, she continued. \u201cNow, tell me a bit more about yourself. You said your family lived in Colorado?\u201d</p><p>Colette nodded and the conversation flowed from then on.</p> <p>The evening was pleasant; the meal was superb and the conversation over coffee afterward was stimulating. Later, studying photographs of Christian as a child and a teenager, Colette felt his absence with a sharp longing that was very different from the way she still missed Derek. That grief was like a dull, familiar ache. This new sensation was...pain.</p><p>\u201cNext week,\u201d Elizabeth murmured as Colette prepared to leave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week,\u201d Elizabeth reiterated. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll make sure Christian comes.\u201d She pinned Colette with narrowed eyes. \u201cYou\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Colette was well aware that Elizabeth already knew the answer to her own question, but she didn\u2019t respond immediately. And when she did, she simply told the truth. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYes, I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p> <p>Alix Townsend</p><p>The weekend was hectic for Alix and Jordan as they quietly went about changing their wedding plans. The first person they talked to was Grandma Turner, who didn\u2019t disguise her pleasure or excitement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it if you had the wedding here,\u201d she said, beaming with pride. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d she whispered in Alix\u2019s ear as she hugged her. \u201cMy grandson\u2019s much too smart to let you go. He knows he has a winner.\u201d</p><p>Alix felt a sense of pure joy at Grandma Turner\u2019s words. In the time she\u2019d stayed with Sarah, they\u2019d grown even closer. Alix hadn\u2019t realized how great the physical and emotional toll had been these last few months. She\u2019d slept twelve hours both nights she was at Sarah\u2019s.</p><p>Jordan had spent those days thinking. He confided in Alix that he hadn\u2019t mentioned the broken engagement to anyone. Instead, he\u2019d thought long and hard about what really mattered in his life. After that, he came to find her, to tell her how much he loved her and needed her. His declaration of love in the back room at Susannah\u2019s Garden had been the most beautiful thing Alix had ever heard.</p><p>While they were separated, Alix had sat by the lake for hours. Being there had calmed her and revived her spirits and it had given her the courage to return to Blossom Street and face her future, with or without Jordan. She felt giddy with relief at the outcome, which his grandmother had never once doubted. It was Sarah who\u2019d suggested the lake house as the perfect place for their wedding. At the time, Alix had been convinced there\u2019d be no wedding.</p><p>The most difficult part would be breaking the news to Jacqueline and Susan. Jordan had asked them both to meet him and Alix at his church office, at nine o\u2019clock Monday morning. As they waited, Alix paced nervously; she couldn\u2019t sit or remain standing. This was going to be horrible; she just knew it. She could feel it in the pit of her stomach. Susan would hate her after this, and Jacqueline would think she was an ingrate.</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s never going to forgive me,\u201d she murmured, pacing the rug in front of Jordan\u2019s desk.</p> <p>\u201cAlix, will you relax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut all the money Jacqueline and Reese have put into this reception...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should never have booked the country club before they discussed it with us. We were trapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d she concurred, but while that was true, it didn\u2019t ease the ache in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cThis is our wedding, Alix,\u201d he reminded her, and it seemed deliciously ironic to have her own words quoted back to her. \u201cI\u2019m as much to blame as anyone. I didn\u2019t listen to you, either. It embarrasses me that I failed you so completely.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder you\u2019re still willing to marry me.\u201d</p><p>His love washed over her, bringing peace to Alix\u2019s heart. But her sense of peace didn\u2019t last. Susan Turner arrived first, bursting into Jordan\u2019s office as if she had a dozen other places she needed to be. She frowned at her watch. \u201cI hope this isn\u2019t going to take long,\u201d she said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for Jacqueline,\u201d Alix said, finally sitting down.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, but I have a meeting and I can\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Jacqueline will be here soon,\u201d Alix said, although her friend would probably show up a fashionable five minutes late, if not ten or fifteen.</p><p>Jordan came around his desk and stood next to Alix\u2019s chair, placing his arm around her shoulder.</p><p>Fortunately for Susan\u2019s schedule and Alix\u2019s nerves, Jacqueline got there almost right away. She looked exquisite, beautifully made up and wearing an elegant pantsuit. \u201cYou asked to see us?\u201d she said, turning to Jordan and Alix with a smile of expectation.</p><p>\u201cMom, Mrs. Donovan, it might be best if you both sat down for this.\u201d Jordan gestured to the sofa, which was positioned against the wall.</p><p>The two women exchanged a puzzled glance, as if the other should be able to provide an explanation.</p><p>Jordan waited until his mother sighed and sank onto the sofa beside Jacqueline. He reached for Alix\u2019s hand and said, \u201cAlix and I want you to know how much we appreciate everything you\u2019ve done for us.\u201d</p><p>His mother checked her watch a second time. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re grateful, Jordan, but Jacqueline and I are meeting with the caterers in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so that was it, Alix thought. They were seeing the caterers for her wedding, and she hadn\u2019t even been informed. That said it all, as far as she was concerned.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jordan shared a knowing look with Alix.</p><p>Alix felt vindicated; Jordan could now see for himself what had been happening all along.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Susan Turner demanded, glaring at them. \u201cWe have that meeting...\u201d</p><p>Jordan returned his mother\u2019s gaze. \u201cThen this will be the perfect time to tell the caterers that the big, fancy wedding you two have arranged has been canceled.\u201d</p><p>His mother\u2019s jaw dropped and she leaped to her feet.</p><p>Jacqueline gasped. \u201cYou\u2019re canceling the wedding?\u201d</p><p>Jordan brought Alix\u2019s hand up and tucked it in the crook of his elbow. \u201cNot entirely. We\u2014\u201d He wasn\u2019t allowed to complete his sentence.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this! Jordan, what are you thinking?\u201d His mother could barely get the words out fast enough.</p><p>\u201cMother, if you\u2019d allow me to finish.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline just sat there quietly. When she caught Alix\u2019s eye, she winked. Alix wasn\u2019t sure what that meant, but she had the distinct feeling Jacqueline understood more than she\u2019d let on.</p><p>Jordan took advantage of the brief silence to say, \u201cWe\u2019re still having a wedding. A different kind of wedding, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you realize how much work, effort and money have already gone into the preparations for this event?\u201d Susan shrieked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline stopped her. \u201cSusan, it\u2019s only right to hear them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Turner,\u201d Alix said, speaking quickly in order to be heard. \u201cI know this must be a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shock,\u201d Susan repeated and sank down onto the sofa again. \u201cShock doesn\u2019t begin to describe what I\u2019m feeling right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually felt we\u2019d gone too far,\u201d Jacqueline said to the other woman.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline interrupted her again, nodding at Alix and Jordan. \u201cTell us what you\u2019ve decided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want a small, private wedding,\u201d Alix explained, forever grateful to her friend. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with Grandma Turner and she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe invitations have already been mailed,\u201d Susan argued. \u201cThe wedding\u2019s scheduled to take place right here in the downtown church. Our friends...\u201d His mother paused and raked her fingers through her shoulder-length hair. \u201cOh, my goodness, we have friends driving all the way from California to attend our son\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen apparently you\u2019re going to have houseguests for a while,\u201d Jacqueline said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the country club afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...but...\u201d Susan sputtered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Alix\u2019s wedding, too,\u201d Jordan told his mother. \u201cShe tried very hard to be the kind of bride you wanted, but unfortunately that isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the reason you disappeared, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jacqueline asked.</p><p>Alix nodded.</p><p>Jordan brought her closer to his side. \u201cAlix has been uncomfortable with this from the first and she did everything she could to let us know her feelings. But like you, I didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t cancel,\u201d his mother insisted. \u201cNot at this late date. Everything\u2019s been arranged!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusan,\u201d Jacqueline barked. \u201cGet a grip here. This is their wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize that all of this is last-minute,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cYou want a small intimate wedding?\u201d Jacqueline continued.</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s what you\u2019ll have. The people who are owed an apology are the two of you. Susan and I need to apologize for taking over the way we did.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s mother was speechless.</p><p>\u201cA small wedding is what Alix has always wanted,\u201d Jacqueline pointed out to Susan. \u201cWe were the ones who let things get out of hand. Reese told me that the other night. When Alix disappeared, he said I\u2019d run roughshod over her, and he was right.\u201d</p><p>Alix bit her lip to hold back tears. How privileged she was to have these two wonderful friends.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had more time to adjust to this since Alix left,\u201d Jacqueline said kindly. \u201cSusan, once you\u2019ve had a chance to think about it, you\u2019ll see this is the best thing all around.\u201d</p><p>In her effort to build a positive relationship with her future mother-in-law, Alix had repeatedly given in to Susan\u2019s demands. The hives had taught her a valuable lesson\u2014denying her emotions didn\u2019t mean they\u2019d disappear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for causing all these problems,\u201d Alix whispered, feeling guilty about the expectations she\u2019d thwarted.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to apologize,\u201d Jordan said, bringing her clenched hand to his lips and kissing her fingers. \u201cYou told us what you wanted and your wishes have been consistently ignored. That won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually calling off the big wedding and planning some little gathering by the lake?\u201d Susan obviously remained incredulous.</p><p>Jordan nodded. \u201cYes, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I told you\u2014the invitations have been mailed. The country club\u2019s been booked, the dinner ordered. Everything\u2019s in motion. I don\u2019t know if it can be stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can and it will,\u201d Jordan said with complete confidence. \u201cAlix and I are prepared to send out a second mailing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd say what?\u201d she snapped. \u201cHow can you possibly explain what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have everything ready to mail. The notice states that we\u2019ve decided on a private ceremony with only our family and a few friends in attendance.\u201d</p><p>His mother shook her head vehemently. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. Jordan, don\u2019t you see what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d Her eyes widened with alarm. \u201cIf you cancel a church wedding at the last minute in favor of a private ceremony, people are going to talk.... It\u2019ll hurt you. Alix,\u201d she said, changing tactics. She turned to face her. \u201cIs that how you want to start your married life, with speculation and...idle gossip as to why you and Jordan are marrying in...in secret?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSusan,\u201d Jacqueline urged a second time. \u201cLet it go, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople can talk all they want,\u201d Jordan said, discounting his mother\u2019s concern. \u201cAlix and I have nothing to hide. If there are rumors, they\u2019ll go away soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your father know about this?\u201d she asked next.</p><p>Jordan shook his head. \u201cAlix and I plan to talk to Dad this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the reception?\u201d Jacqueline inserted.</p><p>The thing that bothered Alix most was the expense her friends had gone to on her behalf. \u201cI\u2019ll reimburse you, Jacqueline,\u201d Alix promised. She had no idea how long it would take, but she was determined to pay back every dime the Donovans had invested in this wedding.</p> <p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Jacqueline said emphatically. \u201cIt\u2019s my own fault. You didn\u2019t ask me to set this up at the country club. As Reese was more than happy to remind me, I brought it on myself.\u201d She leaned back against the sofa. \u201cDo you remember the time I decided to give you a makeover?\u201d she asked, and the memory brought with it a look of sheer amusement. \u201cI took you to my French hairdresser and it was a catastrophe.\u201d</p><p>Alix rolled her eyes. Jacqueline had made a serious attempt to turn her into a beauty queen, with disastrous results. It\u2019d all started when Jordan had asked her out to dinner; it was their first date and Alix had so badly wanted to look pretty for him. In her inimitable way, Jacqueline had decided to help. Not only was the hairstylist deeply offended by Alix\u2019s lack of appreciation, but being forced to try on designer outfits of Jacqueline\u2019s choosing had been a nightmare. Thankfully, Tammie Lee had come to the rescue.</p><p>\u201cJordan,\u201d Susan Turner said, turning to her son as if Alix wasn\u2019t there. \u201cDespite what Jacqueline says, I can\u2019t allow you to do this. I can\u2019t. I know you love Alix and so do I. We all do.\u201d She spoke as if this was a foregone conclusion.</p><p>But if that was the case, Alix found it odd that Jordan\u2019s mother had shut her out of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t let you throw away all our hard work. Don\u2019t you realize Jacqueline and I have slaved on this wedding for weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only you\u2019d asked me,\u201d Alix implored, answering for Jordan, \u201cthen none of this would be necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Susan said, throwing her hands in the air. \u201cI should\u2019ve listened. Now that I think about it, I do recall your objections to certain aspects of the wedding. I agree we didn\u2019t listen as well as we should have, but Alix, that isn\u2019t any reason to flush all our hard work down the toilet.\u201d</p><p>Alix was grateful Jordan\u2019s mother remembered her small protesting voice, although she\u2019d ignored all her wishes at the time.</p> <p>\u201cThe only reason I went ahead with our plans,\u201d Susan went on, \u201cis that I have a lot of experience with weddings and I hoped...I believed you\u2019d be interested in what I had to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was interested, but we didn\u2019t want the same things,\u201d Alix said.</p><p>His mother released a deep sigh. \u201cAll right, then, I apologize. Nevertheless, it\u2019s been done and while we can certainly make some changes, a lot of what\u2019s already been decided will need to stay as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mother, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Jordan broke in. \u201cAlix and I have made new arrangements. We spent the weekend creating our own wedding invitations. There are about twenty and each is handmade.\u201d Jordan walked around the desk and passed one to his mother, who stared down at it stupefied.</p><p>She looked it over, then glanced up, her expression carefully neutral.</p><p>Jacqueline took it out of her hand and studied it. \u201cYou made these?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Jordan nodded. \u201cActually, Alix did most of the work. I helped where I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re exceptional...Alix, I had no idea you were capable of something like this. I love the way you\u2019ve incorporated the hand-knitted lace. What a lot of work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s baking the wedding cake, too.\u201d Jordan looked pointedly at his mother. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a three-tier traditional white cake, decorated with real flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine.\u201d Susan Turner pronounced the words slowly and distinctly as if dragging them through her teeth. \u201cSince you\u2019re so set on this, the only thing left to do is compromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Jordan said, more sternly this time. \u201cAlix and I have made our decision. I\u2019m sorry it isn\u2019t one you like or approve of, but\u2014\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t compromise,\u201d Susan tried again.</p><p>Jordan shook his head. \u201cMom, I\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s nothing more to discuss. Alix and I are going to be married at Grandma\u2019s place on Star Lake.\u201d</p><p>Susan looked helplessly at Jacqueline; Alix read her look and felt terrible. This wasn\u2019t how she wanted her marriage to begin\u2014with disappointments and regrets. For just an instant she wavered.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s hand tightened around hers. Alix knew he understood her need to please others and was forestalling any tendency to surrender.</p><p>\u201cAlix and I will be working on Grandma\u2019s yard, getting it ready. It\u2019s going to be a lovely wedding, our wedding, just the way Alix and I want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but...\u201d All at once, her argument seemed to die. Susan\u2019s shoulders sagged with defeat and she nodded glumly. \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like me to do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Alix assured her. \u201cI\u2019m going to need all kinds of help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Jacqueline asked, eager not to be excluded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll both be vital to the success of our wedding.\u201d</p><p>Susan\u2019s loud sigh reverberated in the small office. \u201cI just hate letting all that food go to waste,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t,\u201d Alix promised. \u201cWe can talk to the caterer and reduce the order. We\u2019re changing the menu a bit, but it\u2019s still going to be exceptional. We\u2019ll have tables set up outside and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want an outside wedding?\u201d Susan made it sound as if Alix had declared she wanted the ceremony performed underwater with Elvis as minister.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jordan answered for her. \u201cAlix and I plan to be married in a place of beauty and peace, surrounded by those we love and not a group of strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Whatever she\u2019d intended to say was broken off. \u201cIt could rain,\u201d Susan said, and seemed almost hopeful that it would.</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I do,\u201d he retorted. \u201cI\u2019ve already asked God to bless our day with sunshine.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>\u201cSometimes in the chaos of everyday life, knitting represents the one thing over which I seem to have any control...and that is sometimes just an illusion.\u201d</p><p>Joan Schrouder, well-traveled knitting teacher and tech answer guru on many knitting lists</p><p>Lydia Goetz</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe the change in Margaret after Julia had positively identified Danny Chesterfield. She actually looked taller to me. I told Brad while I was making dinner one night and he lowered the paper and stared at me. He seemed to think it was a silly comment. If he\u2019d seen her at the store recently, he would\u2019ve noticed the difference himself, especially after this past weekend. Margaret, the girls and I participated in the Relay for Life cancer walk. As it turned out, it was a positive and very emotional experience not only for us but for Amanda Jennings, a teenage cancer survivor I\u2019d come to know. Julia, Amanda and I took part in the survivors\u2019 walk. Margaret and Hailey walked later, taking the early morning shift in the twenty-four-hour event.</p><p>I met Amanda through Annie Hamlin, daughter of my friend Bethanne. Two years ago, Annie came to me when Amanda was diagnosed with her second bout of cancer. I used to visit Amanda in the hospital back then, and we still keep in touch. Annie marched with us, too. Our conversation was lighthearted, and Amanda sounded like the teenager she is. She\u2019d been in remission for fifteen months, and was doing well.</p><p>We all were.</p><p>I actually heard Margaret whistling one morning when she arrived for work. Whistling. I didn\u2019t even know Margaret could whistle. Oh, she can do the kind of whistling where you insert two fingers in your mouth and let it rip. Even as a kid she was known for those ear-splitting blasts. This, however, was like a sweet song. Margaret! I hardly knew what to say\u2014although not commenting was probably for the best.</p><p>She was extra helpful, too. The minute a customer walked in, she was right there, offering service and advice or instructions as needed. She couldn\u2019t do enough, which was a strong contrast to the previous weeks, when she\u2019d glared at anyone who had the temerity to walk into the shop.</p><p>This change in attitude was welcome for more reasons than the obvious. I\u2019d missed her, missed our discussions and I\u2019d especially missed her perspective concerning the changes in our mother\u2019s life.</p><p>Without burdening Margaret with a lot of details, Brad and I had started looking for a facility capable of dealing with Mom\u2019s diminishing mental capabilities.</p><p>Watching our mother decline was heart-wrenching. Several times I\u2019d had to stop myself from telling my sister about Mom\u2019s troubles. Until recently, we\u2019d talked over every decision.</p><p>In the beginning, Margaret balked and said I was exaggerating. She claimed I was worrying too much about one brief conversation with a nurse. I wished that was true, but I knew otherwise. Still, I realized Margaret had all she could cope with just then and I\u2019d accepted that I should be the one to look after our mother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I\u2019d finished my lunch in the back office, there was a lull between customers. \u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d I asked as I joined my sister in the shop, thinking now would be a good time to discuss Mom.</p><p>Margaret looked up from her crocheting. \u201cSure. What do you need?\u201d I couldn\u2019t remember Margaret ever being this agreeable.</p><p>I sat down on the stool by the cash register. Anything to do with our mother drains me physically and I discovered I think better when I\u2019m sitting. Everyone else needs to stand; it\u2019s the opposite for me.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you were by to see her?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>Margaret\u2019s smile disappeared. \u201cSunday afternoon I went over and I took her out for a while.\u201d</p><p>Mom\u2019s symptoms appeared more pronounced to me after the nurse had pointed them out. \u201cHow was she?\u201d</p><p>Margaret considered the question and lifted one shoulder in a halfhearted shrug. \u201cIn a word\u2014confused. We walked around a bit, because I thought the fresh air would do her good. I said you\u2019d been checking out a few new facilities. Afterward she seemed to think I was looking at these places.\u201d Margaret hesitated. \u201cWhen I brought her back to her room, she gave me the biggest smile and said, \u2018Look, this place has furniture just like mine.\u2019\u201d</p><p>If it wasn\u2019t so sad I might have laughed.</p><p>\u201cI saw Mom on Tuesday, and she didn\u2019t remember Dad had died,\u201d I told my sister. I\u2019d had to fight back tears. It\u2019d nearly broken my heart to tell my mother that our father had died four years ago. At first she refused to believe me and then, after a few minutes, she\u2019d started asking about other people. Like her sister, who was gone, too. She and Mom had always been close. Then she wanted to know about a favorite neighbor. After a while, Mom just sat and stared at the wall. I had no idea how to comfort her, so I left, my stomach in one giant knot.</p> <p>\u201cThis memory loss isn\u2019t all that recent,\u201d Margaret commented. \u201cI can\u2019t say I see that much difference.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Before Dad died, Mom was as mentally fit as anyone I knew.</p><p>\u201cDad was aware that she was losing her memory, but he didn\u2019t say anything to you.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her in shock. And yet, I suppose it made sense that my father would share his concerns with my sister and not me. I\u2019d been recovering from my second brain tumor and undergoing an ordeal that would forever mark me. It was just like my father to spare me any additional worry. Naturally, he would\u2019ve discussed his apprehensions with Margaret.</p><p>\u201cIn the beginning, after Dad died, the decline in Mom wasn\u2019t all that noticeable,\u201d I said. \u201cTo me, anyway.\u201d I was still living at home. She seemed lost and grieving but that was to be expected after the death of her husband.</p><p>\u201cDad was her brain,\u201d Margaret said matter-of-factly. \u201cFor a while, after you opened the yarn shop, Matt and I thought about having her move in with us so I could keep an eye on her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou talked to Mom about this?\u201d</p><p>Margaret nodded. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t hear of it. Nevertheless, we didn\u2019t like the idea of her living alone.\u201d</p><p>That caught my attention. Since I\u2019d lived with my mother until I started my business, it was no wonder Margaret had felt so angry with me. My sister saw the fact that I\u2019d launched my own life as an abandonment of our mother. I longed to explain the situation from my point of view so Margaret would appreciate my need for independence. But I couldn\u2019t think of any way to do that without sounding defensive. Or selfish...</p><p>\u201cLast year, her health took a turn for the worse,\u201d I said, returning to the subject of Mom\u2019s condition. \u201cAnd everything started to fall apart for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow the doctor\u2019s taken her off the medication, too,\u201d Margaret said.</p><p>\u201cThe one that helped her memory,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Margaret shrugged, not looking at me. She straightened the yarn on the worsted weight shelves, making busy work, I realized, because she didn\u2019t really want to talk about this. Then, bluntly and to my complete surprise, she said, \u201cMom\u2019s ready to die, you know.\u201d</p><p>An immediate protest came to my lips but I managed to swallow it, although I couldn\u2019t hold back the tears.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Every adult faces the loss of his or her parents sooner or later. It comes with the territory, as Brad once put it. But I didn\u2019t feel ready to deal with Mom\u2019s death four years after Dad. Not so soon, I prayed, pleading silently with God, willing to bargain. Dad had been gone nearly four years; sometimes it seemed like only yesterday and at other times it felt like eons ago.</p><p>\u201cDid you find a new place for Mom yet?\u201d Margaret asked. \u201cBecause I want to talk to the administrator when you do.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI meant to tell you. A memory care facility. It\u2019s one the nurse at the assisted living center recommended.\u201d Brad and I had gone there late Monday afternoon and were impressed with how kind the staff was. We had an appointment later in the week to meet with the administrator.</p><p>\u201cMatt and I can help with the move,\u201d Margaret assured me. \u201cWe\u2019ll rent a truck. There isn\u2019t much furniture anymore....\u201d</p><p>It went without saying that this would likely be our mother\u2019s last home.</p><p>The bell above the door chimed and I looked hurriedly away, wiping the tears from my cheeks. The last thing my customers needed was to find the store\u2019s proprietor weeping.</p><p>Before I could turn back, Margaret let out a bellow of welcome. \u201cDetective Johnson! This is a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>My sister was nearly animated with delight. I\u2019d heard her mention Detective Johnson many times. Before Danny Chesterfield had been brought in for the lineup, Johnson\u2019s name had been followed by murmurs of disgust and an occasional swearword. Ever since Julia had identified her attacker, the detective walked on water. Margaret believed in the system again, believed that justice would be served. Soon the world would be made right once more.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. Langley,\u201d the detective said with a cursory glance around the shop. He seemed uncomfortable in an environment generally reserved for women\u2014although plenty of men enjoy knitting and crocheting, too.</p><p>\u201cHave you met my sister?\u201d Margaret asked and all but dragged me forward to meet her hero. \u201cThis is Lydia Goetz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d He was a nice-looking man in his forties, wearing a well-cut suit, his hair slightly on the long side. I vaguely remembered Colette saying she\u2019d heard of the man assigned to investigate the carjacking. Apparently, her husband had known him.</p><p>\u201cCan I do anything for you?\u201d Margaret asked. \u201cWould you like some coffee? Tea? Knitting lessons?\u201d This might have been confused with flirting had it come from anyone else. My sister is far too abrupt to flirt; I doubt she even knows how.</p><p>\u201cNothing, thanks.\u201d The detective stood there awkwardly, gazing down at the floor for a moment. He raised his head. \u201cI felt I should let you know we took everything we had on Chesterfield to the prosecutor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to arrest him now, right? That\u2019s how it works, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Margaret asked.</p><p>I detected a change in her voice. It was almost as if the anger was back, just below the surface, ready to explode given any provocation.</p><p>\u201cNormally, yes, but Chesterfield came up with a valid alibi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lie!\u201d she burst out.</p><p>Detective Johnson nodded. \u201cWe think so, too. However, we can\u2019t prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Julia identified him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t enough,\u201d the detective said. \u201cThe prosecutor said he can\u2019t make a case. I\u2019m sorry. We can\u2019t charge Chesterfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you aren\u2019t making an arrest?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head sadly. \u201cI know you\u2019re upset.\u201d</p><p>Margaret didn\u2019t bother to acknowledge his statement. Instead she wanted the details. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d Her voice was nearly devoid of emotion, which told me how dangerously furious she was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry....\u201d</p><p>Margaret was too angry to hold still and started pacing. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Langley.\u201d</p><p>I walked over to my sister and put my hand on her shoulder, trying to offer comfort where there was none to be had.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say Danny Chesterfield\u2019s free to hurt someone else\u2019s daughter?\u201d she demanded, not giving the detective a chance to answer her previous question.</p><p>He nodded, his expression grim. \u201cWe did everything we could.\u201d</p><p>Margaret stared straight ahead. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be caught sooner or later,\u201d the detective told Margaret. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time. Again, I can\u2019t tell you how sorry I am.\u201d</p><p>Margaret looked at him coldly.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is that Danny Chesterfield\u2019s all too familiar with the legal system. He knows how to work it. He\u2019s a career criminal with a rap sheet that looks like a spoiled kid\u2019s Christmas list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s supposed to reassure me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I feel bad about this, Mrs. Langley.\u201d I had the definite impression that he\u2019d rather be anyplace than here.</p><p>I admired his courage in coming to talk to Margaret personally rather than telling her this over the phone. Facing my sister couldn\u2019t have been easy, especially when he had to deliver such distressing news.</p><p>My inclination was to console Margaret as best I could. One glance at the hardness that stole over her face told me I\u2019d do well to keep my distance. My sister wasn\u2019t in the mood for consolation.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your stopping by,\u201d I said politely when it became apparent that she had nothing more to say.</p><p>Detective Johnson had walked to the door when he noticed Whiskers, warming himself in the shop window. He paused, then went over to my cat and scratched his ears, forever endearing himself. Whiskers stretched his lean body to its full length and yawned loudly. With a final nod over his shoulder, the detective left.</p><p>Margaret\u2019s confidence that Julia\u2019s ordeal was almost over had been destroyed. \u201cWhat now?\u201d she asked in a hoarse whisper. \u201cHow am I supposed to tell Julia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to mention it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll know.\u201d Margaret still hadn\u2019t moved. \u201cShe\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>I had the urge to take her by the hand and lead her to the office, where I\u2019d force her to drink a cup of heavily sugared coffee. She seemed to be in some form of shock, an anger-induced torment that frightened me. I\u2019d seen Margaret angry before but never like this.</p><p>\u201cI want another detective assigned to the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d I said sharply.</p><p>\u201cA woman this time,\u201d she added, ignoring my outburst.</p><p>\u201cThe prosecutor could be a woman,\u201d I said in an attempt to reason with her.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Margaret said contemptuously. \u201cOnly a man would do something this stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargaret!\u201d She didn\u2019t seem to recognize how outlandish she sounded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She grew quiet again. An unnatural quiet that made chills race down my spine. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over yet,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMargaret.\u201d I tried again, beginning to feel a little desperate. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d I wasn\u2019t letting her out of my sight until I knew her intentions.</p><p>She stared at me, frowning. I wasn\u2019t sure she even saw me because she seemed to look right through me.</p><p>\u201cMargaret,\u201d I repeated, lightly touching her arm. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p> <p>She turned to meet my gaze with eyes so cold and fierce they made me shudder. \u201cIt\u2019s better for you not to know.\u201d Then she calmly retrieved her purse from the office and walked out of the store.</p><p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>Colette Blake</p><p>Colette had looked forward to her dinner with Elizabeth\u2014and Christian\u2014all week. She wondered how his aunt planned to coerce him into making an appearance; she could only hope Elizabeth succeeded. Colette felt an overwhelming urge, a need, to see him...and talk to him. Five months into the pregnancy she couldn\u2019t keep it a secret much longer. It was time Christian knew. Time she found the courage to tell him. Perhaps this evening...Maybe if she told him about this new life, it would convince him to step forward and confess\u2014do whatever was required.</p><p>His aunt Elizabeth had opened Colette\u2019s eyes to so many things about Christian and, surprisingly, about herself. Hiding from him\u2014and hiding the pregnancy\u2014had been foolish, a mistake she wanted to rectify.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t Doris who answered the door this time, but Elizabeth herself.</p><p>Pursing her lips, she announced, \u201cChristian won\u2019t come.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI tried everything I could to persuade him, but he saw through my ploys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Colette assured her quickly, putting on a brave smile. She was determined to look past her own disappointment and enjoy dinner and Elizabeth\u2019s company.</p><p>\u201cNo, this just won\u2019t do,\u201d Elizabeth muttered. \u201cMy nephew is such a stubborn young man. He refuses to listen to reason.\u201d She clasped Colette\u2019s arm, drawing her into the house.</p><p>They sat in the formal dining room and despite the crisp, vivid-green asparagus, the wild rice and tender broiled salmon, neither had much of an appetite.</p><p>\u201cYou must go to him,\u201d the old woman said halfway through the meal. That thought had apparently just occurred to her because she brightened instantly. \u201cIf he won\u2019t come to us, then we\u2019ll take action ourselves. We\u2019ll simply make it impossible for him to ignore us.\u201d She reached for her fork with renewed vigor.</p> <p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Elizabeth countered. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant. Why didn\u2019t I think of it earlier? You will go, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Colette noticed the less-than-subtle shift from us and we to you.</p><p>Justifications and excuses tumbled through her mind. She offered the first one she thought of, weak as it was. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth Sasser scoffed. \u201cHe\u2019s at home.\u201d She rattled off his address, which of course Colette already knew, although she\u2019d certainly never been there.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to see me.\u201d That was a far more valid reason.</p><p>The old woman laughed outright. \u201cContrary to what you think, I\u2019m very sure he does. I know Christian. Go to him, Colette, and it will change everything.\u201d</p><p>Colette wanted to believe her. Before she could actually accept or reject the idea, she found herself standing on Elizabeth\u2019s porch with Christian\u2019s address clutched in her hand.</p> <p>\u201cGo now,\u201d Elizabeth said, waving her away as if she were an unwanted salesman. \u201cWhat is it those commercials say? Just do it! What are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Good question. She had to tell him about the baby; she knew that. It wouldn\u2019t be easy, though, especially after she\u2019d lied\u2014and lied more than once. She\u2019d refused to have anything to do with him for fear of getting dragged into the mess he\u2019d created. And now she was supposed to show up at his front door and gleefully announce that she was pregnant with his child?</p><p>He\u2019d be furious. She couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine what he\u2019d say.</p><p>\u201cColette.\u201d His aunt sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re being as difficult as my nephew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure...\u201d she whispered, unable to hide her dread.</p><p>\u201cGo to him,\u201d Elizabeth encouraged.</p><p>His aunt made it sound so simple. It wasn\u2019t, but she couldn\u2019t possibly understand that, because she only knew half of what was at stake. And under no circumstances could Colette tell her the rest.</p><p>She suddenly had a mortifying thought. \u201cHe\u2019s dating again, isn\u2019t he?\u201d What if she got there and Christian was with another woman? Based on his history, she wouldn\u2019t be surprised to discover him seeking solace elsewhere.</p><p>Elizabeth glared at her. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t. Not really. And yet Elizabeth\u2019s response didn\u2019t exactly reassure her.</p><p>Still...</p><p>She would go to him, and the two of them would talk. Whatever happened, happened. If he went to the police and turned himself in as she hoped, she\u2019d stand by his side. If not, if not...she didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do.</p><p>In an unexpected display of affection, Elizabeth stepped forward and hugged Colette. \u201cEverything will work out,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d Colette joked.</p><p>His aunt grinned. \u201cHave him take you to dinner, my dear. You barely touched a bite.\u201d</p><p>Colette walked down the steps and climbed into her car. Elizabeth remained outside until Colette had pulled onto the street. Through the rearview mirror, Colette saw her raise one hand and wave.</p><p>The drive took less than fifteen minutes. Colette\u2019s heart pounded so hard she didn\u2019t hear anything else\u2014not the car radio, not the music that played, not the siren of the fire truck that blared and honked as it roared past. Only when she saw other vehicles pull over did Colette realize she had to move to the side of the road.</p><p>Once she arrived at his house, she sat in her car and stared up at it. Built of slate, it featured large picture windows that overlooked a bluff on Puget Sound. She could envision the panoramic view his home offered of the water and the Olympic Mountains.</p><p>Her nerve was about to desert her, but she remembered his aunt and the encouragement Elizabeth had given her. Fortified with new determination, Colette got out of the car, ignoring the other vehicles parked on the street.</p><p>After ringing the doorbell, she waited for what might have been ten minutes or a few seconds; she could no longer tell.</p><p>When Christian opened the door, he stared at her, as if uncertain who she was.</p><p>\u201cColette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise,\u201d she said. Her voice rose like a little girl\u2019s, embarrassing her even more.</p><p>After an uncomfortable moment during which neither of them spoke, he narrowed his eyes, obviously questioning her presence. He made no move to invite her in. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the warm greeting she\u2019d hoped to receive. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d Because this was so difficult for her\u2014and no doubt for him\u2014she added, \u201cIf you\u2019d rather I left, I\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen leave.\u201d He glanced quickly over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou have a...guest?\u201d So he was involved and this other woman was with him. Colette felt her cheeks burning; coming here had brought her nothing but anguish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back another time,\u201d she said hastily, about to turn away.</p><p>He leaned forward to take her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe me any explanations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>They continued to stare at each other. When she could stand it no longer, Colette lowered her gaze. \u201cLike I said, we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe can do it later.\u201d</p><p>His face remained unyielding. \u201cGo now and\u2014\u201d There was a noise behind him and he threw another irritated glance over his shoulder. He seemed on edge and eager to have her leave and yet he still held on to her.</p><p>\u201cForgive me for interrupting your meeting...your privacy,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cCould we set up a time to talk, maybe tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI leave for China in the morning.\u201d She had trouble identifying his tone\u2014regret? Wariness? Resolve?</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll phone you when I get back,\u201d he said as he released her.</p><p>She backed away and he did, too.</p><p>The urge to touch him, to kiss him was overpowering.</p><p>As if reading her thoughts, he reached for her again, and pressed his mouth to hers. His lips were moist and fervent.</p><p>In the distance someone\u2014a man\u2014called his name and Christian pushed her gently away. \u201cGo,\u201d he said. \u201cJust go.\u201d</p><p>Confused, she stumbled to her car. That was when she saw the black sedan with a couple of muscular-looking Chinese men, obviously bodyguards, watching her. This could only mean that Christian was meeting with the people involved in the smuggling operation.</p><p>Shaking with fear, Colette drove back to Blossom Street. The first thing she did when she got into her apartment was lock the door. Then she made herself a cup of tea, sipping it slowly. Finally she called Alix. Her friend was expecting to hear how the evening had gone. So, of course, was Elizabeth, but Colette didn\u2019t know what she could say to Christian\u2019s aunt.</p><p>Alix answered on the first ring. \u201cDid he show up?\u201d she demanded before Colette could say a word.</p><p>During their lunch hour, they\u2019d gone to Go Figure, and Alix had offered Colette a complete exercise circle\u2019s worth of advice about tonight\u2019s dinner.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say he didn\u2019t come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...he had a meeting.\u201d Colette swallowed against the dryness in her throat.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d \u201cHis aunt suggested I should go to him.\u201d \u201cGood idea,\u201d Alix said approvingly.</p><p>But neither Elizabeth nor Alix understood that this was the worst idea of all. Swallowing again, Colette continued. \u201cHe had...guests. He said he\u2019s leaving for China tomorrow morning.\u201d And whatever he intended to do there, Colette didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>Alix Townsend</p><p>Monday was Jordan\u2019s day off from his work at the Free Methodist Church. With so much to do before the wedding, which was two weeks from this coming Saturday, they\u2019d decided to spend the afternoon cleaning up Grandma Turner\u2019s yard.</p><p>Alix had brought the completed prayer shawl and looked forward to giving it to the woman who\u2019d come to mean so much to her. She could hardly put into words the solace she\u2019d found with Jordan\u2019s grandmother after she\u2019d broken off the engagement. Sarah had sat with her and listened while Alix spilled out her frustration and pain. Then she\u2019d insisted Alix eat. She\u2019d had her stay in the spare bedroom, looking after her like a cherished guest. It was just the pampering Alix had needed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On Monday afternoon, Jordan waited for Alix to finish her shift at the French Caf\u00e9. The day had turned out to be gloriously sunny and warm, an exception to the cool weather May had brought so far. Although her fianc\u00e9 had assured his mother the sun would shine for their wedding, Alix was pragmatic enough to suggest they rent a large white tent. There was always the chance, she\u2019d joked, that someone else with a connection to the Guy Upstairs had asked for rain to water his crops.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Alix said as she got into the car beside Jordan.</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself.\u201d He leaned over and touched his lips to hers in a casual kiss.</p><p>Like her, Jordan seemed a lot more relaxed since their confrontation.</p> <p>\u201cGrandma\u2019s really excited that we\u2019re coming to visit,\u201d he said as he checked his sideview mirror and merged with the Blossom Street traffic.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her we\u2019re doing yard work, did you?\u201d Once Grandma Turner heard that, Alix was afraid she\u2019d be out digging in the flower beds herself.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d He headed for the entrance to the Interstate.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Alix laid her head back and closed her eyes. She\u2019d been awake since three that morning, with the same questions chasing around and around in her mind. She\u2019d tried to ignore them, especially those having to do with his mother. \u201cI love you, Jordan,\u201d she said, her eyes still closed.</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d he asked, as if her statement amused him.</p> <p>\u201cLots. Mostly, I love you for loving me enough to cancel the big wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That.\u201d His voice fell, and Alix opened her eyes to look at him.</p><p>\u201cIs it bad?\u201d she asked, biting her lip. It couldn\u2019t be easy for any of his family. Susan was the one on the front lines. The curious questions from relatives and friends would all be directed at her. She was stuck canceling the arrangements, too, since she\u2019d booked most of them.</p><p>\u201cMom will survive,\u201d Jordan assured her.</p><p>\u201cDoes she hate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlix, of course not! She understands.\u201d</p> <p>That comment produced an involuntary smile. The one thing Alix had gleaned from their meeting the week before was that Susan Turner most definitely did not understand.</p><p>When they arrived at Grandma Turner\u2019s house on Star Lake, the sun gleamed on the water and the afternoon was about as lovely as Alix could have hoped for. After greeting them, Jordan\u2019s grandmother insisted on serving them iced tea out by the lake.</p><p>\u201cI thought that while I was here I\u2019d mow the lawn,\u201d Jordan told her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that. I have a service that comes in every two weeks. I\u2019ve already asked them to make a special trip right before your wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma, we don\u2019t want you to do that,\u201d Alix said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to do it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d she said, refusing their offer with an airy wave. \u201cGetting the lawn mowed is the least I can do.\u201d She urged Alix and Jordan to eat more of the oatmeal cookies she\u2019d brought out with the tea. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how happy I am that you\u2019re holding the wedding here.\u201d She gazed wistfully out at the lake. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved this house. It\u2019ll be wonderful to have all my children and grandchildren together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy about it, too,\u201d Jordan said, linking his fingers with Alix\u2019s.</p><p>Jordan had described his visits to the lake when he was a child but Alix didn\u2019t know how much he\u2019d loved his grandmother\u2019s home until she\u2019d suggested getting married here. An elated expression had come over him and he\u2019d immediately agreed it was the perfect place, a perfect solution.</p> <p>This close to the lake, Alix could feel a light breeze. She set her iced tea on the round patio table and saw Jordan\u2019s grandmother glancing over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cJordan, would you mind bringing me my sweater?\u201d Sarah asked. \u201cIt\u2019s hanging on the peg just inside the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Alix nodded to Jordan and instead of heading for the house, he went to his car and came back with a white box, tied with a red bow.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Grandma Turner asked when he returned.</p><p>\u201cA little something for you from Alix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlix?\u201d Wearing a puzzled look, Grandma Turner turned to her.</p><p>\u201cJust open it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you be bringing me gifts?\u201d</p><p>The answer to that was simple. \u201cBecause I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alix,\u201d the old woman said, sighing. \u201cYou\u2019re the best gift I could ever have.\u201d Shaking her head, she added, \u201cI couldn\u2019t ask for a better match for my grandson. I\u2019m so happy for you both.\u201d Her eyes filled with tears, which she blinked rapidly away.</p><p>Alix struggled not to cry herself.</p><p>\u201cOpen the box before we all start to boo hoo,\u201d Jordan teased, pretending to wipe tears from his face.</p><p>Alix elbowed him in the ribs as his grandmother removed the lid and peeled back the tissue paper.</p><p>\u201cAlix knit it herself,\u201d Jordan explained even before his grandmother had the opportunity to lift the lacy shawl from its box.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the prayer shawl I mentioned earlier,\u201d Alix said. \u201cPeople knit them for other people who are special in their lives or in need of prayer or healing. You listened when I needed a friend and loved me when I didn\u2019t think anyone in this family ever would again.\u201d Alix looked at Jordan, who leaned forward and kissed her forehead. \u201cThose days with you meant a lot to me. I realize you\u2019re not sick or in need of extra prayers, but I did want you to know how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alix.\u201d Grandma Turner breathed her name softly, reverently. \u201cI remember you telling me about the shawl. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever received anything more precious. All the effort that went into this...I will treasure it for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>Alix gently, almost ceremoniously, arranged the shawl around the old woman\u2019s shoulders, and they hugged.</p><p>After they\u2019d finished their tea, Jordan mowed the lawn over Sarah\u2019s objections and clipped the hedge, while Alix tackled the flower beds, weeding and cultivating the soil. When they were done, she planned to spread beauty bark over the freshly tilled beds.</p><p>\u201cThis garden used to be the pride of the neighborhood,\u201d Grandma Turner said as she stood beside Alix. \u201cI do what I can now, but it isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never had flowers at our house when I was growing up.\u201d Alix kept her voice matter-of-fact. She remembered that the house had gone without more than flowers. Several times it lacked a window and once, the front door. Her mother had thrown a beer bottle at her father, who\u2019d ducked; the bottle had broken the living-room window. Another time, when Alix was around six, her father had kicked in the front door.</p><p>Alix had always envied people who had yards with flowers. Her own yard was an embarrassment, not that Alix spent much time worrying about grass and stuff like that. It was a much higher priority to stay out of range of both her parents when they drank. That was the reason she\u2019d found a safe haven in her bedroom closet, where she\u2019d created her fantasy family.</p><p>\u201cI want you and Jordan to stay for dinner,\u201d Grandma Turner said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Jordan has any plans. Let me ask.\u201d</p><p>Jordan, done with clipping the hedge, drank a second glass of iced tea and then joined Alix in weeding the flower beds. She told him about Sarah\u2019s invitation.</p><p>\u201cKnowing my grandmother, she\u2019s already inside fixing a meal,\u201d he said, moving close enough to kiss Alix\u2019s sweaty neck.</p><p>\u201cJordan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to stay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>It\u2019d been so long since they\u2019d spent time together like this. Alix hadn\u2019t fully understood how much strain the wedding had placed on their relationship. Once they\u2019d made the decision to take control of it, the stress was gone.</p><p>Dinner was a simple affair of soup and sandwiches, which they ate on the patio facing the lake. Grandma Turner fell asleep soon after Alix had carried the dishes inside. Jordan saw his grandmother into the bedroom and then helped Alix clean up the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cNot every girl enjoys spending time with a guy\u2019s grandmother,\u201d he said as he took a dish towel from the rack.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I was thinking?\u201d Alix murmured, washing by hand the few dishes they\u2019d used.</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re crazy in love with me,\u201d Jordan responded quickly. \u201cIn fact, you can\u2019t wait to drag me into your bed and have your way with me.\u201d</p><p>Alix grinned. \u201cWell, other than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d He stood behind her and wrapped his arms around her middle.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking how peaceful it is, being here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He dropped a kiss on the curve of her neck. \u201cWell, this place isn\u2019t going to be so peaceful on June second.\u201d</p><p>Alix leaned against him. \u201cTell me the truth\u2014has it been a problem for you at church?\u201d She guessed that Susan\u2019s concerns about what this might do to Jordan\u2019s career were valid. Changing the wedding to a small, private affair so close to the date was likely to cause speculation.</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d Jordan admitted.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cPastor Downey, my dad and I had a heart-to-heart.\u201d</p><p>Alix wasn\u2019t sure what that entailed nor was she sure it was her business to ask. She waited for Jordan to volunteer the information.</p><p>After a brief silence he sighed and released her, then rested against the kitchen counter. \u201cDad asked me if I\u2019d gotten you pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she exploded, and watched as a grin spread slowly across Jordan\u2019s face. \u201cDid he really ask you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Jordan nodded. \u201cAnd I enjoyed telling him I looked forward to doing exactly that.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d talked about starting a family but not for several years. \u201cYour mother put him up to it, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Jordan shrugged. \u201cI assume so.\u201d</p><p>Alix knew she faced some damage control with Susan Turner. As soon as the wedding was over, she\u2019d begin to repair their relationship.</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s a good thing Pastor Downey, Dad and I talked,\u201d Jordan went on to tell her. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that enough. Male bonding.\u201d He pounded his chest in a Tarzan imitation. \u201cMe like bonding.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, loving him all the more for making a joke of it.</p><p>\u201cWe all felt better afterward,\u201d Jordan said in his normal voice, \u201cand I have you to thank for that.\u201d</p><p>Alix hoped it was true.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jacqueline and Reese?\u201d Jordan asked her.</p><p>Alix assured him they were fine. The funny part was, neither Jacqueline nor Reese seemed especially upset about the wedding plans being overturned. If anything, Reese found his wife\u2019s wedding fixation rather comical.</p><p>As Alix had suspected, it all went back to Paul and Tammie Lee\u2019s wedding. To Jacqueline\u2019s horror, not only hadn\u2019t she been included, she hadn\u2019t even been invited. She\u2019d felt cheated, and as a result, she\u2019d turned Alix and Jordan\u2019s wedding into a substitute\u2014and then some. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Jordan murmured. \u201cI\u2019m much happier with what we\u2019re doing now.\u201d</p><p>They hugged and Alix closed her eyes. In a little more than two weeks she would be Jordan Turner\u2019s bride. June second couldn\u2019t come fast enough.</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>\u201cKnitting a prayer shawl is \u2018putting legs to your prayers.\u2019 It is an outward reminder that someone cares.\u201d</p> <p>Cheryl Gunnells, Executive Director of Publications, Leisure Arts, Inc.</p><p>Lydia Goetz</p><p>Apparently, Alix hadn\u2019t guessed that this last get-together of the shawl-knitting class was a surprise wedding shower for her. Once the word was out, I was delighted by how many people wanted to be part of it.</p><p>The first person to contact me was Carol Girard. She still had trouble believing she was actually pregnant. Every time we talked about it, Carol started to giggle. A pregnancy was never supposed to happen for her and Doug.</p><p>I told her I\u2019d once read a scientific report that stated there was no logical reason a bumblebee should fly. The aerodynamics were all wrong, but apparently someone forgot to tell the bumblebee.</p> <p>Carol\u2019s pregnancy did give me pause. I wondered if such a miracle would be possible for me. Unfortunately, chemotherapy and radiation play havoc with the reproductive system.</p><p>A part of me longed for a child, an infant to hold and nurture and love. I\u2019d assumed that in time this resurgence of baby hunger would go away, but it hadn\u2019t yet. I lay awake at night thinking about a baby. Brad and I continued to discuss adoption, but we\u2019d decided to think it over for a few months. There was no need to make a decision yet.</p><p>Back to Alix\u2019s party...Bethanne Hamlin was supplying the decorations. Her party business had become a notable success, and there was even talk of franchising the company. Whenever I thought back to the first time I met her, I was astonished that this was the same woman. In those days, Bethanne had lacked the initiative to do something as simple as sign up for a knitting class; her daughter Annie was the one who\u2019d phoned. To be fair, Bethanne was still staggering from the pain and shock of her divorce, and her self-esteem was in ashes.</p><p>Well, talk about rising from the ashes! The woman who was convinced she had no skills, no talents and no prospects, now headed a huge party business. The last I heard, she had thirty employees. Thirty!</p><p>Annie was in her first year of college and planned on getting a business degree so she could join her mother. Two years ago who would\u2019ve believed something like this could happen?</p><p>Courtney, who\u2019d also been in my sock-knitting class, mailed a gift for Alix when Annie Hamlin told her about the surprise shower. Courtney was away at the University of Illinois at Chicago; she hoped to eventually become a nutritionist. Bethanne\u2019s son, Andrew, and Courtney were still in touch, too, which pleased me. I knew they\u2019d maintained their long-distance relationship, because Courtney had recently e-mailed me about shipping her some yarn. She was knitting Andrew a sweater for his birthday in his school colors. Alix would love knowing that Courtney hadn\u2019t forgotten her.</p> <p>Naturally, Jacqueline and Tammie Lee planned to attend, even though they\u2019d already been part of another shower for Alix at the country club. They were bringing all kinds of treats for the party, everything from small quiches to a selection of cheeses. Tammie Lee told me she was also preparing a southern delicacy\u2014pickled hardboiled eggs. Jacqueline said I should count my blessings that Tammie Lee hadn\u2019t decided to cart in a Crock-Pot full of boiled peanuts.</p><p>It warmed my heart to see the two of them getting along so well.</p><p>Margaret would be here, too. I\u2019d hoped Julia and Hailey could come, but unfortunately, they both had after-school events. Margaret hadn\u2019t said much about Julia lately. When I asked, she changed the subject, evaded the issue or glared defiantly. Clearly, this wasn\u2019t something she wanted to discuss, especially now that Danny Chesterfield had been released. My sister\u2019s anger and her frustration with the police had returned tenfold.</p><p>I tried not to worry about Julia or Margaret, but it was hard. Hailey and I talked every once in a while, and I got more news from her than I did from my own sister, whom I saw five days a week.</p><p>The door opened and Bethanne Hamlin breezed into the store, hauling a huge box. Her hair was shorter than I remembered, and her sleeveless summer dress revealed a golden tan. I could tell she felt embarrassed when I told her how gorgeous she looked, but it was the truth.</p><p>\u201cThanks for doing all this,\u201d I said and would\u2019ve hugged her if not for the large carton she held.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d Bethanne set the box on the table and started to unpack. She had ties for the back of each chair, which resembled wedding veils, and silk flower bouquets that she attached to the veils, each one in a pastel shade. She draped the table with a decorated cloth and then brought out a silver tray with minisandwiches and sugar cookies shaped like champagne glasses.</p><p>Even before she\u2019d finished, Jacqueline and Tammie Lee came in with their bounty, followed by Elise and Maverick Beaumont. I immediately pulled out a chair for Maverick, who seemed thinner than the last time I\u2019d seen him. His complexion was pale, too, and he seemed weak and tired. He was losing his battle with cancer. No one needed to tell me that; I could see it for myself.</p> <p>Elise stayed close to his side, as she had for the past two years. They were devoted to each other. Watching them together, so tender and loving, brought tears to my eyes. I hoped Brad and I would be like them in our old age.</p><p>Elise used to be an embittered woman who resented her ex-husband, Maverick, for his many supposed transgressions, including the fact that he was a professional gambler. Her life had become more and more rigid in her retirement, not less, as you might expect. But reconciling with Maverick had completely changed her.</p><p>In addition to being my friend, Elise was one of my very best customers. When it came to knitting, there wasn\u2019t any project Elise couldn\u2019t tackle. The most complicated patterns didn\u2019t daunt her.</p><p>As the time neared for Alix\u2019s arrival, everyone dispersed.</p><p>\u201cI see her,\u201d I called from where I stood by the window. I watched Alix leave the French Caf\u00e9, carrying a basket of what I suspected were warm croissants. \u201cHide, everyone,\u201d I instructed, and all my friends scrambled. I hurried over to the counter.</p><p>The three customers in the shop had been told what was happening and been invited to join the festivities.</p><p>The bell chimed as Alix stepped inside, then paused, glancing around. I\u2019m no actress, but I did my best to look as if this was an ordinary afternoon.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked, frowning.</p><p>I stood behind the cash register, trying to keep our little secret as long as possible. The plan was to wait until Alix approached the table before everyone leaped out and shouted, \u201cSurprise!\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s here,\u201d Alix said in a puzzled voice.</p><p>\u201cColette and Susannah will be here in a few minutes.\u201d In reality, they\u2019d been among the first to show up. They had a large order to get out that night and it was a sacrifice for them to be here at all, but neither was willing to miss it.</p><p>Alix still didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cGo on back.\u201d I gestured to the rear of the shop.</p><p>Alix sent me an odd look, and I was sure that despite my efforts I\u2019d given the surprise away. She moved past the yarn\u2014and then everyone rushed forward to shout.</p><p>To my utter satisfaction, Alix was stunned. Her mouth fell open and she slowly turned and studied each face. The table was piled high with gifts and food, and everyone crowded around to offer her their best wishes.</p><p>Alix always claimed she wasn\u2019t any good in social situations, but after I saw her at this wedding shower, I begged to differ. She charmed her friends and thanked them for their gifts with unquestionable sincerity. The gifts were mostly thoughtful with a few comical ones tossed in. My sister\u2019s present, a toaster, was as practical as Margaret herself. Mine was a gift card for $100 worth of yarn. My favorite present was an oversize T-shirt with an image of Shakespeare knitting a sleeve. \u201cThat\u2019s the \u2018raveled sleeve of care,\u2019\u201d Elise the ex-librarian explained. \u201cSleep knits it up again. Isn\u2019t that a lovely metaphor? It\u2019s from Macbeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, knitting puts you to sleep,\u201d Maverick teased.</p><p>Alix laughed and hugged them both.</p><p>At closing time, the party broke up and people started drifting away. Bethanne had to leave early because of an \u201cappointment\u201d; I was willing to bet she was going out on a date, but I didn\u2019t question her. I knew she\u2019d met someone, and I was eager to hear the details. I could\u2019ve asked Annie, who\u2019d stayed to clear away the decorations, but I figured Bethanne would tell me when she was ready. I could wait.</p><p>At one point I saw Margaret talking intently to Alix and wondered what that was about. My sister didn\u2019t look happy, nor did she seem to be congratulating Alix on her marriage. A while later, Alix moved off to visit with someone else. Then, before I knew it, Margaret had left for the day without even a word of farewell.</p><p>Colette and Susannah had to get back to the store to work on the arrangements for a funeral home, which was a new account Susannah had recently won.</p><p>Elise and Maverick didn\u2019t last long after the gifts had been opened and the food served. I walked them to the car, which Elise drove. I could see the sadness in her eyes and felt an almost maternal urge to comfort her. These next few months were going to be difficult. Maverick, however, didn\u2019t show any concern for himself.</p><p>I understood that, too. He\u2019d received far more love and care in these last few years of his life than he\u2019d ever dared to hope. I knew he was as content and happy as possible, happier than he\u2019d been in all the years he was a champion poker player. He\u2019d been a fairy godfather to us all and we loved him deeply, each and every one of us.</p><p>When I returned to the store, the only person left was Alix.</p><p>\u201cI phoned Jordan,\u201d she said as she gathered up her gifts. \u201cHe\u2019s going to come by in a few minutes to drive me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Alix helped me clean up and I saw her glance my way a couple of times.</p><p>\u201cWere you surprised?\u201d I asked as I dumped paper plates in the garbage.</p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d She looked up at me, her eyes shining. \u201cIt was wonderful, Lydia. Thank you so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were happy to do it for you, Alix,\u201d I murmured, moved by the fervency of her response.</p><p>\u201cDid you see me talking to Margaret?\u201d Alix asked a few minutes later as she wrapped the leftover croissants in a plastic bag.</p><p>I nodded. Naturally, I was curious and hoped Alix would elaborate. Margaret shared so little with me these days.</p><p>\u201cMargaret came to me,\u201d Alix began. \u201cShe asked if we could talk privately.\u201d Alix frowned, presumably at whatever Margaret had said. \u201cI told her I\u2019d talk to her, but it\u2019d have to wait until after the shower. I couldn\u2019t very well leave everyone,\u201d she said.</p><p>I agreed, and couldn\u2019t figure out what my sister had to say that was so confidential.</p><p>\u201cWhen the party was winding down, she pulled me into a corner,\u201d Alix went on. \u201cIt was about what happened to Julia. I thought things were sort of back to normal, but I guess not.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you heard or not,\u201d I told her, \u201cbut the police felt they were close to an arrest. Then the prosecutor decided they didn\u2019t have enough evidence to charge him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what she said. And why she asked...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsked what?\u201d I had the feeling I wasn\u2019t going to like this.</p><p>\u201cMargaret wanted me to...help her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks I might have a contact.\u201d Alix\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t meet mine. \u201cApparently, Margaret thinks I might know someone who\u2019d be willing to hurt Danny Chesterfield.\u201d</p><p>Despite my effort to remain calm, I gasped and brought my hand to my mouth.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want him killed or anything,\u201d Alix rushed to explain. \u201cShe wants him hurt. Badly. At least one broken bone\u2014his right arm\u2019s what she suggested, but if the leg was easier, she\u2019d settle for that.\u201d</p><p>I hardly knew how to respond other than with absolute horror. My sister was prepared to go to any lengths to see that Danny Chesterfield was punished for his crime.</p> <p>\u201cShe said she was willing to pay, and she wanted to be sure that whoever I found let Danny know this was payback for what he\u2019d done to Julia.\u201d</p><p>Reaching for the back of a chair, I yanked it out and sat down. I felt as if my legs would no longer hold me upright. Never in all my life had I believed my sister capable of such an action.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t very pleased with me,\u201d Alix said.</p><p>\u201cYou told her you wouldn\u2019t do it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! What do you think I am?\u201d She paused, giving me a wry smile. \u201cI might\u2019ve considered doing it as a favor three or four years ago, but I don\u2019t do things like that anymore.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t speak. I simply couldn\u2019t speak. I vacillated between pity and anger. I considered having Brad contact Matt, since they got along well and I figured my brother-in-law would know how to handle the situation. Or should I talk to Matt myself?</p> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t like what I had to say,\u201d Alix continued. \u201cI told her that hurting Danny, breaking his leg or anything else, wouldn\u2019t fix the way she felt.\u201d</p><p>No, Margaret wouldn\u2019t like hearing that.</p><p>\u201cI said Danny Chesterfield was a despicable human being who deserved to be in prison. I told her I thought it was only a matter of time before he ended up there. If not for what he did to Julia, then for some other crime. It\u2019s a shame someone else has to suffer\u2014I feel bad about that.\u201d</p><p>Alix wasn\u2019t the only one. Margaret had ranted about it for days until I thought I\u2019d scream.</p><p>\u201cHard as it is, I suggested she try to forgive the creep,\u201d Alix said. \u201cIt\u2019s what I had to do with my mother. For a long time I was angry with her for not being the kind of mother I needed. Her addictions to drugs and alcohol made my childhood...difficult. I mean, I know she was a product of her own weakness and her own background. But her problems could weigh me down for the rest of my life if I let them.\u201d Alix\u2019s face brightened with the intensity of her feelings. \u201cInstead of letting that happen, I followed Jordan\u2019s advice and...forgave her.\u201d</p><p>My admiration for Alix, already high, rose about a thousand percent. I wanted to tell her that, but the lump in my throat prevented me from speaking.</p><p>\u201cAbout two years ago I wrote her a letter,\u201d Alix told me. \u201cJordan helped me with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p> <p>Alix shrugged. \u201cNot much really. Just that I supposed she did the best she knew how and that I forgave her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did she respond?\u201d It wasn\u2019t any of my business but I was understandably curious.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d Alix told me with a tinge of sadness. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear from her for about six months, and then she wrote and said that since I got religion I probably wouldn\u2019t be any good to her.\u201d Her eyes glazed over for a moment.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell my sister any of this?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI tried, but...\u201d Alix shook her head. \u201cMargaret wasn\u2019t in the mood to hear it.\u201d</p><p>That figured. Once again I wondered what\u2014if anything\u2014I could do to help my sister. And once again, no real solution presented itself.</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>Colette Blake</p><p>Christian had left for China a week ago. Colette could only speculate on his business there. During her years as his assistant, she\u2019d booked any number of flights for him and knew he frequently traveled to Asian countries, particularly China. The thought of him dealing in human cargo turned her stomach. How long had it been going on, she wondered. And the question she asked over and over: Why? Still, she had difficulty equating the man she knew and loved\u2014yes, loved\u2014the man whose child she carried, with a man who\u2019d do something so criminal. And beyond criminal, so cynically cruel.</p><p>Regardless, and in the face of her dangerous knowledge, Colette waited patiently for word from him. He hadn\u2019t said exactly how long he\u2019d be away. His trips lasted anywhere from one to three weeks, and more often than not, he experienced delays, but she expected to hear from him soon. Now that she\u2019d made the decision to tell him about the baby, the news burned within her.</p><p>For the first time since she\u2019d left Dempsey Imports, she felt a real sense of hope. The thing about hope, she discovered, was that it was like a powerful painkilling drug. Despite her fears, her mood remained optimistic. Even the weather cooperated, and the days were bright with sunshine.</p><p>Fridays were usually busy at Susannah\u2019s Garden and this particular Friday was no exception. All morning, Colette was occupied with walk-ins, who were quickly becoming twenty to thirty percent of their business.</p><p>One of the local high schools was having their Junior/Senior prom that evening. Susannah and Chrissie spent the afternoon assembling boutonnieres and corsages as fast as they could in their crowded workspace.</p><p>Colette admired the way Susannah constantly came up with inventive ideas to make her little shop known in the area. If that meant offering a large floral arrangement as a raff le gift to one of the service organizations, then she did so willingly. She visited hospitals, wedding planners and funeral homes and outlined her services. Business continued to flow into the shop at an increasing rate. Some days the two of them could barely keep up; more and more often, Chrissie was coming by after her classes to help out.</p><p>Colette appreciated her assistance and calm, cheerful demeanor, but what impressed her most was Chrissie\u2019s devotion to her grandma Leary, who lived in eastern Washington. Every two or three days Chrissie made a point of phoning her grandmother. Colette knew Susannah was close to her mother, too, and called her often. Fortunately, she had a good friend who kept in touch with Mrs. Leary and reported back.</p><p>The phone rang and Susannah answered it. She glanced at Colette, and thinking it might be a private conversation, Colette walked outside to check on the flowers in their buckets. She rearranged them, adding irises to the lilies to create an appealing array of colors.</p><p>After several minutes she returned to find that Susannah was still on the phone. She removed it from her ear, held her hand over the receiver and said, \u201cActually, this is for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Colette\u2019s first thought was that it must be Christian, although she recognized that this was more hope than expectation. She couldn\u2019t understand why Susannah would be talking for so long with someone who\u2019d asked to speak to her. She hurried over and Susannah passed her the phone.</p><p>\u201cThis is Colette Blake,\u201d she said in her most professional voice.</p><p>She heard a sob and then in crisp tones, \u201cColette, it\u2019s Elizabeth Sasser.\u201d</p><p>Alarm filled her instantly. \u201cElizabeth, is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my dear, I\u2019m afraid...it isn\u2019t.\u201d Her words faltered, and Colette could tell that Christian\u2019s aunt was struggling to keep her composure.</p><p>\u201cIs it...Christian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have bad news.\u201d The old woman paused, then exhaled sharply. \u201cWhen it\u2019s convenient, would you mind stopping by the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Colette\u2019s pulse hammered violently. Bad news? Something had happened to Christian; that was the only thing it could be. All her fears came together at once and for a moment she felt as if she might throw up.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Elizabeth whispered. Almost in afterthought, she added, \u201cCome as soon as you can.\u201d</p><p>The line was disconnected before Colette could question her further.</p><p>Slowly she replaced the receiver. Susannah came to stand next to her and slipped an arm around Colette\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you what happened?\u201d Colette asked her, needing to know, no matter how bad the news.</p><p>\u201cNo. She couldn\u2019t. She was so upset, the housekeeper had to talk to me. But she was pretty distraught, too, and I had trouble understanding her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoris,\u201d Colette said. \u201cHer name is Doris.\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded. \u201cDoris explained that Elizabeth received a phone call about half an hour ago and that she\u2019d nearly collapsed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d It was the same feeling Colette had experienced when she\u2019d followed the aid car to the hospital after Derek\u2019s fall.</p><p>\u201cColette, there\u2019s no need to believe the worst.\u201d Susannah gave her a reassuring squeeze. \u201cDo you want Chrissie or me to drive you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She was surprisingly calm, but then she had been after Derek\u2019s accident, too. The initial rush of panic had subsided and in its place had come this numb sensation, this chilling certainty. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to leave you in the lurch,\u201d she told her employer.</p><p>\u201cGo, don\u2019t worry. Chrissie will be here in an hour and in the meantime I have everything under control.\u201d</p><p>Not feeling any need to rush, Colette washed her hands, collected her purse, then walked to the alley where she kept her car. The numbness started to fade, and she felt a tightness instead, gripping her chest. If she\u2019d been older, she might have feared that this pain signaled the beginning of a heart attack. But she knew it wasn\u2019t that. This was what loss felt like.</p><p>The identical sensation had accompanied the E.R. physician\u2019s words when he\u2019d led Colette into a private office and told her there was nothing left to do but wait for death. Derek would never recover from his coma, he\u2019d said. Nothing could change that outcome.</p><p>Even in the heavy Friday-afternoon traffic, Colette didn\u2019t lose her composure. Because Christian would still be dead, whether she got to Elizabeth\u2019s house in ten minutes or in forty.</p><p>When she arrived at the old woman\u2019s picturesque home, she carefully parked the car. In that instant her grief felt too much to bear and she pressed her forehead against the steering wheel and silently prayed for strength.</p><p>She loved Christian. If she\u2019d ever doubted it before, there was no question now. He would never know. Never learn the truth. Never hold their baby. She\u2019d have to accept that the same way she\u2019d accepted everything else in the last two years.</p><p>Drawing a deep breath, Colette climbed out of her car. She\u2019d barely rung the bell when Doris flung open the massive door, and with red-rimmed eyes, led Colette into the library. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Doris told her, wringing a white handkerchief between her hands. \u201cMiss Elizabeth needs you.\u201d</p><p>Colette entered the library and sat down on the ottoman at the older woman\u2019s feet. \u201cCan you tell me what happened?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>Elizabeth shook her head. \u201cNo one knows. Christian is missing, lost somewhere inside China. No one\u2019s seen him.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cFor the past week, no one\u2019s heard from him. A whole week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got on the plane in Seattle, correct?\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth nodded. \u201cAccording to the airline, Christian landed in Beijing. That\u2019s where the trail stops. As far as his office is aware, he was scheduled to change to a connecting plane there, but he never arrived in the other city. I\u2019ve forgotten its name,\u201d she added fretfully.</p><p>\u201cHow did you hear about this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMy nephew Elliott phoned. Christian\u2019s father. Someone at Dempsey Imports called him. He phoned me right afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s being done to find him?\u201d Colette asked, her mind darting in several different directions. Surely there were ways of locating someone inside a foreign country.</p><p>\u201cElliott asked if anyone had contacted the U.S. embassy, and apparently that\u2019s been done. The hospitals have all been checked, jails, hotels. Other places, as well. Nothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know the name of the person your nephew talked to at Dempsey Imports?\u201d Colette hated to be drilling some poor staffer, but she needed as many facts as she could get.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I use your phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Anything. I just have to know Christian\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d been almost five months since Colette had talked to anyone at Dempsey Imports. In fact, she\u2019d gone out of her way to avoid contact with her former friends. But none of that mattered now.</p><p>Elizabeth pointed to the hallway. \u201cThere\u2019s a phone in there.\u201d For the first time the old woman\u2019s expression was hopeful, as if Colette might discover something no one else had.</p> <p>Colette found the phone and turned on the hallway light. She didn\u2019t need to look up the number or the extension. Even after all these months, it was still as familiar as her own.</p><p>Two short rings. \u201cJenny Hilton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenny, it\u2019s Colette Blake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColette! Oh, my goodness, Colette!\u201d Jenny exploded with surprise. \u201cWhat happened? It\u2019s like you disappeared off the face of the earth. Everyone\u2019s been asking about you and I didn\u2019t know what to tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got another job,\u201d Colette said. She wanted to keep explanations to a minimum.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, have you heard about Mr. Dempsey?\u201d</p><p>Before Colette could respond, Jenny continued. \u201cHe\u2019s somewhere in China. At least that\u2019s what we think\u2014no one knows for sure. It\u2019s all kind of crazy around here at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d Colette said, hoping for more information. \u201cWhat can you tell me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot much,\u201d murmured Jenny. \u201cHis assistant\u2019s been on the phone for three solid days. Apparently Mr. Dempsey\u2019s father is flying to China to start a private search. From what I understand, Mr. Dempsey was making one of his routine trips to Zhongshan, the same one he\u2019s made at least a dozen times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that no one\u2019s heard from him, either here or in China. Most of the time it\u2019s perfectly safe for tourists there...But the strange part is that he was supposed to visit the manufacturer in Zhongshan and they had no record of him coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t expecting him, then?\u201d she asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cRight. But we thought that\u2019s where he was. Anyway, Mr. Dempsey\u2019s father checked into his flight plans and discovered he landed in Beijing but had never made a reservation to continue on to Zhongshan.\u201d</p><p>If Colette was frightened before, it couldn\u2019t compare to what she felt now. Wherever Christian was inside China, she had to believe it was connected to the mess he\u2019d become involved in. She\u2019d pleaded with him to get out; unless he did, there could be no future for them. Colette had begun to suspect that Christian had heeded her words. He\u2019d tried to get out\u2014and his disappearance was her fault. He\u2019d done this for her...</p><p>Colette bit her lip. Christian had gotten in deeper than he\u2019d ever intended and now he was trapped. The men involved in operations like this weren\u2019t the forgiving kind. Maybe it was too late to get out; maybe he knew too much. That seemed the only logical explanation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird, you know,\u201d Jenny was saying.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Colette asked. \u201cWeird, how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ve been all kinds of government agents here the last couple of days.\u201d</p><p>Colette closed her eyes and swallowed hard. \u201cDo you have any idea what they were looking for?\u201d Another thought hit her. Maybe Christian didn\u2019t want to be found. Maybe his disappearance was all part of some escape plan to avoid prosecution in the States. It made sense, and yet Colette couldn\u2019t make herself accept it. He\u2019d told her he was coming back, asked her to wait. He would never have done that if he\u2019d planned to disappear.</p><p>Jenny sighed. \u201cThe agents talked to several people but not to anyone I know well, otherwise I would\u2019ve asked what it\u2019s all about. As you can imagine, the office has been buzzing, but it\u2019s hard to tell which rumors have any basis in truth and which don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you phone me if you hear anything new?\u201d Colette asked.</p><p>\u201cI would if I had your number,\u201d Jenny said tartly. \u201cYou never answered my question. How come you disappeared like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...needed a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf friends, too, it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jenny, it was just...too much. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so interested in what happened to Mr. Dempsey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked for him for five years. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Give me a number where I can reach you.\u201d</p><p>Colette rattled off her cell phone number. After thanking Jenny and agreeing to get together when this was all over, she replaced the receiver.</p><p>Elizabeth stood in the hallway, leaning against the wall. \u201cWhat did you learn?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Colette told her what little she knew, but she kept her own suspicions\u2014and the part about the government agents\u2014to herself.</p><p>Christian\u2019s great-aunt seemed to be more in control of her emotions now. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s anything we can do other than pray,\u201d she said. She looked older and frailer.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a cup of tea,\u201d Colette suggested. \u201cMy mother told me everything seems better after tea.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth favored her with a smile. \u201cYour mother is a wise woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d Colette said. \u201cI\u2019ve missed her very much since my parents moved to Colorado.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth headed back into the library. \u201cI\u2019d be honored if you\u2019d consider me family,\u201d she murmured after slowly lowering herself into her chair.</p><p>\u201cThen I will,\u201d Colette told her.</p><p>\u201cWill you stay?\u201d Elizabeth asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil we know?\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t think my heart can deal with more bad news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with you,\u201d Colette promised. Her own heart couldn\u2019t take any more bad news, either.</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>Alix Townsend</p><p>Jordan\u2019s parents had invited Alix and Jordan to a barbecue at their home on Sunday afternoon. Hoping to patch things up with her future mother-in-law, Alix had readily accepted. She made a bowl of potato salad and baked a rhubarb cake, one of Jordan\u2019s favorites.</p><p>Alix looked forward to being part of the Turner family, which she\u2019d always seen as a delightful bonus to marrying Jordan. It was invitations such as this backyard barbecue that she\u2019d longed for as a child. If her parents had friends over it was so they could drink together. What food there was on those occasions came from a fast-food joint.</p><p>When the kids at school talked about camping trips and picnics, Alix had nothing to say. Not once in the entire time she was growing up had she walked through the woods or experienced a family outing.</p><p>Her fantasy family in the closet did all those things, though, and that was where Alix laughed and played and escaped.</p><p>Jordan picked her up before church and placed the salad in a cooler he\u2019d brought in his trunk.</p><p>\u201cThat cake doesn\u2019t happen to be rhubarb, does it?\u201d he asked, eyeing the glass dish hopefully.</p><p>\u201cIt might.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he settled his arm around her shoulders. \u201cYou love me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must,\u201d she returned. He\u2019d been teasing but she was entirely serious. She\u2019d never been this happy, never known she could be. It still astonished her that this very special man could see past the gruff exterior she\u2019d maintained a few years ago, when she was working at the video store. That was where they\u2019d reconnected. She would be forever thankful for his persistence and his ability to recognize the real Alix Townsend beneath the spike-haired, leather-jacketed tough girl she\u2019d been back then. Come to think of it, though, her appearance hadn\u2019t changed that much....</p><p>Today, however, in deference to his parents, she wore a straight khaki skirt, plain white blouse and ballet-style flats.</p><p>After church, Jordan drove to his parents\u2019 house in south Seattle. His father, Larry, was a pastor at the Free Methodist Church there. The parsonage was next door, a brick, single-family home built in the 1950s, long before either Jordan or Alix was born. The front lawn had recently been mowed and Alix could see a thin line of smoke spiraling from the backyard.</p><p>\u201cLooks like Dad\u2019s already got the barbecue going,\u201d Jordan said as he led the way into the house. \u201cLess work for me.\u201d He didn\u2019t knock, but opened the front door and walked in, calling out as he did. \u201cMom, Dad! We\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Susan came out of the kitchen, her face wreathed in a smile. She hugged each in turn, and Alix could tell that her welcome held nothing back.</p><p>\u201cI brought a cake and a salad,\u201d she told her, setting the cake on the table. Jordan put the cooler on the kitchen counter.</p><p>\u201cAlix,\u201d Susan said, \u201cthat wasn\u2019t necessary. My heavens, your wedding\u2019s next week! You must have a hundred things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, everything\u2019s under control.\u201d Or it was now that the wedding had been scaled down to just Jordan\u2019s family and their own close friends. Alix loved the simplicity of it\u2014especially compared to the five-act play, complete with sets, props and a cast of thousands that Jacqueline and Susan had tried to produce.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s father came inside, and father and son exchanged hugs.</p><p>Alix liked the fact that her fianc\u00e9 and his father had such a good relationship. When it came time to start their family, she knew Jordan would be a wonderful dad and his parents would be ideal grandparents. That was a comfort\u2014although the thought of motherhood still scared her. She told herself repeatedly that it was something she didn\u2019t need to worry about yet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Susan had prebaked the spareribs and while Alix set the outdoor table, Larry and Jordan stood on the lawn by the barbecue. They chatted as Larry slathered the ribs in sauce, and their laughter floated over to her. Alix enjoyed their easy camaraderie.</p><p>\u201cI talked with Grandma Turner,\u201d Susan said, joining Alix on the patio, carrying two glasses of lemonade. \u201cShe\u2019s very pleased that you and Jordan are using the lake house for your wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been so good to us.\u201d Alix didn\u2019t know what she would\u2019ve done without the love and support of Jordan\u2019s grandmother.</p><p>Susan handed Alix her lemonade. \u201cI invited her to join us today, but she called this morning and said she was feeling a bit under the weather.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe wedding isn\u2019t too much for her, is it?\u201d she asked anxiously. Although she and Jordan had done everything they could to ensure that none of the burden fell on his grandmother, Alix was still concerned. Sarah was eighty-six, after all.</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Susan dismissed her question. \u201cGrandma would be terribly disappointed if you and Jordan were married anywhere else. Besides, your wedding will be like a family reunion for her.\u201d</p><p>Alix took a small sip of her lemonade.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Colette\u2019s friend?\u201d Susan asked next as they sat at the picnic table across from each other. \u201cI was at the flower shop and Susannah said Colette\u2019s been off work because someone she knows\u2014her former boss, apparently\u2014has gone missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She nodded. \u201cHis name\u2019s Christian Dempsey.\u201d</p> <p>The word was out to the media now, and there was plenty of speculation. \u201cIsn\u2019t it bizarre?\u201d Christian Dempsey\u2019s disappearance in China had made all the local newscasts.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a front-page article in this morning\u2019s paper,\u201d Susan told her. \u201cNo one seems to know what\u2019s happened to him. When\u2019s the last time you talked to Colette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday.\u201d Alix remembered their lengthy conversation. \u201cShe\u2019s staying with Christian\u2019s great-aunt Elizabeth. He\u2019s like a son to her and she\u2019s taking the news badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Susan murmured. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep all of them in our prayers.\u201d</p><p>Alix mumbled her thanks. Extra prayers certainly couldn\u2019t hurt, and she\u2019d given it a try herself, as well.</p><p>There was a pause as Susan leaned forward, tension in every line of her body.</p> <p>\u201cUh, Alix.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI hear that Margaret Langley asked a favor of you.\u201d Susan seemed to be making an effort to sound casual.</p><p>Alix hid her frown behind the glass, sipping while she composed a response. She\u2019d told Jordan about Margaret\u2019s request and while she hadn\u2019t explicitly asked him to keep their conversation to himself, she hadn\u2019t expected him to run tattling to his parents, either.</p><p>\u201cApparently she wanted some...help from you?\u201d Susan elaborated.</p><p>Setting her glass on the picnic table, Alix wrapped her hand around it. \u201cJordan talked to you about that, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you aren\u2019t upset, but he did mention it to his father, and Larry told me.\u201d Susan seemed surprised by her reaction. \u201cI would never have brought it up if I\u2019d known...well, actually I would have. Do you mind if we talk frankly?\u201d</p><p>Alix pushed the glass aside and nodded. \u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to love you, Alix. I want you to know that. I remember you as a child, attending Sunday school classes. You were always a sweet little girl, so eager to please and learn. When my husband started the bus ministry, we were so happy that both you and your brother were part of it.\u201d</p><p>It was difficult to hold back a snicker. \u201cMy parents were willing to send us anywhere as long as we were away from the house for a couple of hours on Sunday morning.\u201d She stared right into Susan\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou know, so they could sleep off their hangover.\u201d</p> <p>Susan ignored that. \u201cI remember how hard you tried to fit in with the other girls,\u201d she went on.</p><p>Alix remembered, too. She hadn\u2019t owned any clothes other than what she wore to school. There were no pretty dresses for her at Easter or Christmas. She felt fortunate if she got a piece of clothing that didn\u2019t come out of a secondhand store.</p><p>\u201cI really stuck out, didn\u2019t I?\u201d she said. She recalled how badly she\u2019d wanted to win the Bible that was a prize for the kid who could recite the most verses from memory. She\u2019d been willing to memorize a hundred of them. She\u2019d won it, too, although she\u2019d lost that Bible somewhere along the way. Her Bible and just about everything it stood for.</p><p>\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t typical of the children in Sunday School,\u201d Susan confirmed.</p><p>\u201cI still stick out, don\u2019t I?\u201d Alix asked, getting to the essence of the conversation. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want to say, right?\u201d Alix tried to make this as straightforward as possible. \u201cSpeaking plainly, you don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be a good wife for Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not it at all,\u201d Susan rushed to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s just the church where you don\u2019t fit in.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThat sounds so unkind and I don\u2019t mean it to, Alix, I really don\u2019t. I\u2019m thinking of Jordan a few years down the road when he\u2019s a senior pastor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll be hindrance to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing a pastor\u2019s wife takes a special kind of woman.\u201d</p><p>Alix took a moment to consider that. \u201cYou\u2019re saying I need to be more like you.\u201d</p><p>Susan shook her head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy working in a church, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say. People have no idea they\u2019re being so critical. The congregation will judge Jordan when they look at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Alix hadn\u2019t thought of it in those terms.</p><p>Susan glanced over her shoulder at her husband and son. \u201cLarry doesn\u2019t know we\u2019re having this conversation,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cDoes Jordan?\u201d If he did, Alix swore she\u2019d get up and walk out right this minute.</p><p>\u201cHeavens, no!\u201d Susan said. \u201cI wanted this to be woman to woman.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s mother didn\u2019t need to say it; Alix already knew. She knew because she\u2019d heard that one-sided conversation at the Donovans\u2019. \u201cLast month, a few days before I called off the big wedding,\u201d Alix said, staring down at her lemonade, \u201cI was over at Jacqueline\u2019s. The two of you were talking on the phone and Jacqueline didn\u2019t realize I was in the house. I wasn\u2019t intentionally eavesdropping and should\u2019ve left, but I heard my name mentioned. I got the gist of the conversation in about two seconds. You\u2019d rather I didn\u2019t marry Jordan.\u201d</p><p>A flush of embarrassment rose to the other woman\u2019s cheeks. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not it at all! Oh, dear, I\u2019m making a mess of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain it to me,\u201d Alix said, struggling not to sound defensive or angry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that...\u201d Susan paused. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve had some concerns and,\u201d she added quickly, \u201cit\u2019s occurred to me that my son\u2019s ready to marry a woman with connections to a hit man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a few whores, too,\u201d Alix said as if this were all a joke. \u201cActually, they were pretty decent people. I\u2019ll bet that surprises you.\u201d</p><p>Susan blinked a couple of times.</p><p>\u201cDid Jordan ever tell you about when I was living on the street? Or how often I ran away from foster homes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlix, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Susan whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. You\u2019re probably right. You expected your son to marry a pretty blond church girl. You certainly didn\u2019t expect him to choose someone with a mother in prison and a father who walked out and never looked back. I\u2019ve committed my share of sins, done drugs, lived on the edge. I\u2019m a long way from that skinny little girl working so hard to earn a Bible in Sunday School.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s mother paled.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the worst of it,\u201d Alix told her coldly.</p><p>\u201cPlease, this isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d Susan pleaded. \u201cJordan loves you and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen. What you need to understand is that I\u2019m not the person I used to be,\u201d Alix said, swallowing the lump in her throat. She refused to allow Susan to see her cry. \u201cJordan knows that, but I don\u2019t think you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Susan admitted. \u201cBut what am I supposed to believe when I hear about people coming to you asking to have someone killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot killed, injured,\u201d Alix corrected\u2014as if that really made a difference. \u201cMargaret wanted the man who attacked her daughter to hurt the same way he\u2019d hurt her.\u201d She must have raised her voice because Jordan glanced at them.</p><p>\u201cDid Dad tell you about that?\u201d he asked his mother, hurrying over to where they sat.</p><p>Susan met Alix\u2019s eyes and silently pleaded with her not to divulge the rest of their conversation. \u201cYes, he did say something about it,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cAlix and I were discussing...the incident.\u201d</p><p>Stepping up behind Alix, Jordan rested his hands on her shoulders. \u201cDid Alix tell you what she told Margaret?\u201d His voice was impassive but Alix could feel the intensity of his emotion.</p><p>His mother shook her head. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t gotten to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe talked to Margaret about forgiveness,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cWhat a marvelous response, don\u2019t you think? I\u2019m pretty sure Margaret listened, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she did,\u201d Alix murmured, but she couldn\u2019t know for sure.</p><p>\u201cShe listened because Alix has experienced that kind of anger and pain herself. She doesn\u2019t like me to mention it, I know. It takes a pretty incredible woman to rise above the life Alix was forced into. Every day she amazes me more.\u201d He reached down to squeeze her hand. \u201cOnly someone who\u2019s learned to forgive great pain can help someone else who\u2019s still hurting.\u201d</p><p>Clasping his hand, Alix twisted around and shot him a warning glance, which Jordan ignored.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons Alix is going to be such an asset to me, in church and outside of it,\u201d Jordan continued. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t afraid to talk to her about anything. That\u2019s the gift she brings to my ministry.\u201d His eyes met hers and he smiled. \u201cHaving been raised in the church, I have a hard time reaching street kids. They don\u2019t think I can identify with their problems and they\u2019re right, I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve never spent a night sleeping in some alley. But Alix has and she\u2019s risen above it. They\u2019ll listen to her far more than they ever will me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes a street ministry interest you?\u201d his mother asked, sounding surprised.</p><p>Jordan nodded enthusiastically. \u201cMom, I don\u2019t want to preach to the choir for the rest of my life. A doctor goes to people who are sick. These kids need God\u2019s love. But I can tell them all about it and what they need to do and they\u2019ll yawn in my face. Then they look at Alix and see someone who\u2019s changed her life. Who do you think they\u2019re going to listen to? Me, who\u2019s lived a comfortable life, or Alix who\u2019s been where they are?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Susan turned to Alix, her expression unreadable.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t just street kids, either. It\u2019s everyone. I couldn\u2019t have chosen a woman with a kinder heart. She cares about people and they see that and love her back.\u201d He paused. \u201cI see the way kids gravitate toward her. She doesn\u2019t judge them, she listens with love and understanding and tells them there\u2019s a better way.\u201d</p><p>Once more Susan\u2019s eyes locked with Alix\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cJordan, would you bring me the plate?\u201d his father called out from his position at the barbecue. \u201cThese ribs are done to perfection.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure thing!\u201d Jordan disappeared into the kitchen.</p><p>Susan hung her head. \u201cI feel like such a fool, Alix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. After his little speech about forgiveness, Alix couldn\u2019t possibly be angry. It hurt, what his mother had said, and it would take a while for that pain to go away; nevertheless, this was an important relationship to both her and Jordan. \u201cYou love your son and you want the best wife for him. I can\u2019t be upset about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...Oh, I feel so foolish. Jordan\u2019s right. You\u2019re going to make him a wonderful wife, and you\u2019re going to be a good pastor\u2019s wife, too.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI plan to try.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Susan whispered and her voice cracked as tears filled her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t hate me.\u201d</p><p>Alix took the other woman\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given you every reason to dislike me and despite that you\u2019ve been nothing but kind. I\u2019m so sorry. Can we put this behind us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what the Lord\u2019s Prayer is all about?\u201d Alix asked. \u201cAsking God to forgive us our trespasses as we forgive others\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Susan smiled through her tears. \u201cI\u2019ve been married to Larry for thirty-eight years and been a pastor\u2019s wife all that time, yet it seems I have much to learn from you.\u201d She stood, and came around the table.</p><p>Alix met her halfway and they held each other fiercely.</p> <p>This was a new beginning\u2014the beginning Alix had been hoping for.</p><p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>Colette Blake</p><p>Colette couldn\u2019t sleep. It might as well be noon instead of three o\u2019clock in the middle of a moonless night.</p><p>Every time she closed her eyes, all Colette could think about was Christian. The scenarios that ran through her tortured mind were so terrifying, she had to force herself not to scream or cry. Every day without news intensified her fear that Christian would never be found. China was a huge country and no one seemed to have any idea where Christian might be. No one was saying anything, at any rate.</p><p>Elizabeth had asked Colette to stay with her until this was resolved, one way or another. But how much longer should they continue to hold out hope?</p><p>Elliott Dempsey had landed in Beijing and phoned to tell them he\u2019d spoken to the U.S. embassy. He\u2019d hired an investigative team and was awaiting word. He phoned at least once a day with an update. So far every lead had come to an abrupt dead end. Christian had never arrived in Zhongshan\u2014but this was information Colette already had. His trail began and ended in Beijing.</p><p>Climbing silently out of bed, Colette crept down the stairs. A glass of milk might help relax her enough to sleep.</p> <p>When she came into the kitchen, Colette was surprised to find Elizabeth sitting at the table, dressed in a long robe. Her white hair hung down around her shoulders.</p><p>Elizabeth gave her a tired smile. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t sleep, either?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Colette shook her head. \u201cI came down for a glass of milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, too, but it hasn\u2019t done me any good,\u201d the old woman said. \u201cI doubt it\u2019ll help you, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it time.\u201d It wasn\u2019t like Elizabeth to be so negative.</p><p>\u201cTime! I\u2019ve been sitting here for an hour and I don\u2019t feel the slightest bit tired yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t slept in days.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth grimaced. \u201cNeither have you.\u201d</p><p>That was true. Ever since she\u2019d gotten word, Colette hadn\u2019t been able to rest for more than an hour or two. She couldn\u2019t release the tension\u2014and the fear\u2014that held her in its grip.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cWe should talk.\u201d</p><p>Colette poured the milk, then sat at the wooden table, wondering what Elizabeth could possibly say that hadn\u2019t already been said a hundred times.</p><p>\u201cChristian and I spoke the night before he left,\u201d the old woman began. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to tell you, but I think now...now that it\u2019s been nearly ten days without word...Well, I\u2019ve decided you have a right to know.\u201d She paused and Colette waited for her to go on, hardly daring to breathe.</p><p>\u201cHe came to me after I tried to play matchmaker.\u201d She revealed a hint of a smile and motioned with her hands, as if to say that entire scheme had been a failure. \u201cI\u2019m no good at subterfuge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was sweet of you to try.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cThat\u2019s a compliment compared to what Christian had to say on the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d As long as she\u2019d worked for him, Christian had never refrained from expressing his feelings.</p><p>\u201cHe told me it was better for both of you if he stayed away.\u201d Elizabeth scowled in disapproval. \u201cI argued with him but it got me nowhere. Men! I never met one with a lick of sense. Even Charles...\u201d Sighing, she lifted her shoulders in a resigned shrug. \u201cNever mind, this is about Christian and not Charles, although they\u2019re more alike than I realized.\u201d</p><p>She sighed again. \u201cChristian also said there were things he couldn\u2019t discuss. Why he\u2019d say that to me, I have no idea. I tried to get him to talk but he refused. He said it was safer if I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Elizabeth seemed perturbed at his reticence. \u201cHe did tell me something significant, though. Perhaps he had a premonition that he wouldn\u2019t return, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d Colette pleaded.</p><p>\u201cIt should come as no surprise. My nephew loves you.\u201d</p><p>Colette brought her hand to her throat. \u201cHe actually told you that?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth snorted. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m making it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but...\u201d Tears filled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in some kind of trouble,\u201d his great-aunt said thoughtfully. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t tell me, no matter how hard I pressed.\u201d</p><p>Colette lowered her head. \u201cI know what it is.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth stared at her, incredulous. \u201cYou know and you haven\u2019t said anything to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something you won\u2019t want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best tell me right this minute, young woman.\u201d</p><p>And so Colette did, describing what she\u2019d found on his computer and her own reaction to it. She told Elizabeth about everything, including the anonymous letter she\u2019d written to the INS, her suspicions about where he was now and why.</p><p>The old woman didn\u2019t ask a single question until Colette had finished. \u201cYou don\u2019t seriously believe my nephew\u2019s involved in human trafficking?\u201d she said, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure what to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear girl. Christian would no more sink to that level than I would. If you had a single active brain cell, you\u2019d know that.\u201d Then, more sympathetically, she asked, \u201cHave you been carrying this burden all these months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I saw,\u201d she said defensively.</p><p>\u201cOr what you thought you saw,\u201d the old woman countered.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t deny it.\u201d</p><p>This gave Elizabeth pause, but only for a moment. \u201cI refuse to believe it.\u201d</p><p>The baby moved, reminding Colette how much she had at stake. \u201cThe only thing we can do is ask Christian himself\u2014once he\u2019s back,\u201d she said, unwilling to accept that he wouldn\u2019t return. Hope was all they had to live on, and for now it was enough to see her through another day.</p><p>They were silent for a long time after that.</p><p>\u201cI have contacts in the government,\u201d Elizabeth eventually said. \u201cI\u2019ll get to the bottom of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should never have kept this information to yourself, Colette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad I known, I could have acted sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho will you ask?\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cCharles and I were good friends with the parents of our state senator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA...senator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get me the information I need. I wish you\u2019d had the common sense to tell me all this before now,\u201d she complained again.</p><p>\u201cMe, too, but I didn\u2019t want to distress you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Elizabeth patted her hand. \u201cAt least you\u2019ve told me. I\u2019ll deal with it, and we\u2019ll find out the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Colette said. \u201cAnd you might\u2019ve said something about what Christian told you.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth had the grace to smile. \u201cYes, my dear, I suppose I should have.\u201d She gazed at Colette with somber eyes. \u201cLet me tell you this. You hold his heart in the palm of your hand.\u201d</p><p>Colette felt a warmth that spread through her whole body. \u201cAnd he has mine. All I hope is that he knows it.\u201d</p><p>Christian\u2019s great-aunt relaxed in her chair. \u201cHe visited me late that night\u2014the night before he left. It was well past the time I generally retire, but I\u2019d been reading. I\u2019d just headed up to bed when he came unexpectedly to the house. I spoke to him about his manners, but I let him in.\u201d She shook her head in some amusement. \u201cMen, especially the younger ones, have no sense of propriety.\u201d</p><p>Christian\u2019s visit had occurred the same night she\u2019d gone to him. The night he\u2019d kissed her.</p><p>\u201cWe had tea in the library,\u201d Elizabeth said, \u201cand it was the best visit I\u2019ve had with him in years. It reminded me of when he was a boy....\u201d Her voice grew soft with affection.</p><p>Colette closed her eyes, picturing Christian with his aunt in this room she\u2019d come to love, with its marble fireplace and row upon row of books. She could so easily see him there, leaning forward intently as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cHe told me about your...night together,\u201d Elizabeth continued, eyebrows raised. \u201cNaturally, I didn\u2019t let on that I knew all about it\u2014and its consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d was all Colette could say.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just for your sake, my dear girl. My nephew was making his grand confession. He was in a wretched state, certain that his impulsiveness had ruined everything. I wasn\u2019t about to admit that you\u2019d already shared your secret with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me, as you had, that you\u2019d worked for him for five years and that he\u2019d never looked upon you as anything more than a valued assistant\u2014until after your husband\u2019s death. He was also sure you\u2019d seen him only as your employer. Until then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAfterward he said he\u2019d behaved badly. He was afraid he\u2019d destroyed your relationship. Apparently, you had the same reservations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Everything Christian had told his aunt was true. But two unexpected events had altered the situation. The first was the fact that she was pregnant and the second was what she\u2019d discovered on his computer. She understood now that at least part of his reserve after the holidays could be attributed to his illegal activities.</p><p>Colette saw that Elizabeth was smiling now. \u201cI\u2019ve known Christian his entire life,\u201d the old woman said. \u201cI know that young man better than his own father does. He can be stubborn and unreasonable. When he came to me that night, I saw him as a man in love, a man who feared he\u2019d risked too much.\u201d</p><p>Tears clouded Colette\u2019s eyes as something else occurred to her. \u201cIt\u2019s like you said earlier\u2014he suspected he might not come back. That\u2019s why he told you.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth grabbed Colette\u2019s hand with surprising strength. \u201cWe have to trust he\u2019ll come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want him to know we love him,\u201d Colette whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe knows,\u201d Elizabeth said, her voice confident. \u201cI have to believe he does.\u201d</p><p>Colette had to believe that, too.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cI\u2019d suggest we try again to sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Colette finished her milk, rinsed the glass and set it in the sink. Together, the two women climbed the wide sweeping staircase to the second floor. They parted there, Elizabeth going to her own room at the end of the hall, while Colette walked to the opposite end, to the guest bedroom.</p><p>For the first time since she\u2019d arrived, Colette slept for four hours straight. When she woke, the sun was high and light spilled into the room.</p><p>Seconds later, she realized what had awakened her\u2014the sharp ring of a phone. With a burst of hope, she tossed aside her covers and ran out of the room. She stood at the top of the stairs and listened as Elizabeth answered the phone. After the initial greeting, the other woman was silent for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d she cried suddenly, but her exclamation of joy was immediately followed by a cry of frustration.</p><p>Colette moved down to the top step.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, of course,\u201d Elizabeth was saying. \u201cDon\u2019t spare any expense,\u201d she said. \u201cFind him, Elliott, and don\u2019t come home until you do.\u201d</p> <p>So Christian hadn\u2019t been rescued. Overcome by discouragement and frustration, Colette sank onto the step and buried her face in her hands. She didn\u2019t know how Elizabeth was holding up when Colette\u2019s own sense of hope was all but shredded.</p><p>Colette returned to her room and quickly pulled on slacks and a light sweater. She\u2019d shower later. Right now, it was more important to learn what Elizabeth had been told by Christian\u2019s father.</p><p>Colette found her in the garden, watering her plants.</p><p>\u201cI heard the phone,\u201d Colette said, stepping onto the back patio.</p><p>Elizabeth gasped. \u201cDidn\u2019t anyone ever tell you to announce yourself properly instead of scaring people half to death?\u201d</p><p>Taken aback, Colette froze. Then she saw that Elizabeth\u2019s cheeks were stained with tears. \u201cTell me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe know where he went,\u201d Elizabeth said hoarsely. She took a moment to compose herself. When she spoke again, her voice was clear. \u201cThe investigator Elliott hired discovered that Christian ended up in a completely different city. A town actually. In Shanxi province.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat I can\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>Colette frowned. \u201cHas Elliott tracked him down in this other place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Elizabeth sighed heavily. \u201cNot yet. He\u2019s making arrangements to search for him now. I trust he\u2019ll find Christian soon.\u201d</p><p>Colette did, too. She was counting on it.</p><p>CHAPTER 35</p><p>\u201cIn knitting, as in life, there are usually two ways to go: The easy way and the hard way. Often we find out about the easy way only when we are three-quarters of the way through with the hard way.\u201d</p><p>Ann Shayne and Kay Gardiner, Mason-Dixon Knitting Potter Craft, 2006</p><p>Lydia Goetz</p><p>I was very concerned about Margaret. I couldn\u2019t ignore what Alix had told me about her wanting to pay someone to injure Danny Chesterfield. I waited, mulling over the situation before I approached Brad. When he heard my news, a dark frown crept slowly across his face.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Matt knows about this?\u201d he asked, bringing me a cup of coffee after dinner on Tuesday evening.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d I gratefully accepted the coffee. It had become our habit to sit down and talk after the evening meal. We took turns making coffee or tea, and now that it was springtime, we often sat on the patio behind the house. I treasured these hours with my husband, even when we just sat in companionable silence.</p><p>Brad lounged on the deck chair next to me and cradled his mug with both hands. \u201cWe should tell him,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cI think so, too. Only...\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure how to say this. \u201cYou know how private Margaret can be.\u201d</p><p>Brad looked over at me. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to offend your sister by going behind her back.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, feeling relieved at his understanding. \u201cIt might be best if we talked to the two of them together,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure Margaret will react to being confronted with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not well,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut I hope she\u2019ll realize I couldn\u2019t ignore this. I want her to know that I know.\u201d My worst fear was that my sister would end up in jail while Danny Chesterfield roamed free. But Margaret was already in a prison of her own making, confined by her hate and her unwillingness to come to terms with what had happened.</p><p>Brad stood abruptly and set his mug aside. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d I should\u2019ve known he wouldn\u2019t want to delay doing something about this. Brad is a man of action.</p><p>I don\u2019t think the same way Brad does, which is one reason I hadn\u2019t mentioned it immediately. I needed to consider the problem from all angles, examine various options. Not Brad. He wanted to move forward, talk to Matt right away. A part of me was grateful not to carry this burden alone anymore, and yet I wasn\u2019t sure that marching over to Matt and Margaret\u2019s was the best course of action.</p><p>Brad settled the matter with one incisive question. \u201cDo you want your sister to follow through with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will, Lydia.\u201d</p><p>I knew he was right and the longer we waited, the more likely it was that Margaret would find someone to commit this crime on her behalf.</p><p>Fortunately, Cody had gone to his friend Zack\u2019s down the street, and Mrs. Miller was happy to keep him there for another hour.</p><p>On the drive over to my sister\u2019s, I asked Brad to do the talking once we arrived. I was nervous. Margaret can take offense so easily and she\u2019d be furious with me for involving myself in affairs she considered none of my concern.</p><p>I pictured her blowing up at me, quitting her job and cutting off our relationship. That would devastate me. My mind always seemed to gravitate to the worst possible scenarios. It\u2019s a tendency I\u2019ve had for most of my life, even before the cancer. I find it frightening, unproductive and disconcerting\u2014and I couldn\u2019t quite suppress a sigh as I thought about this. I was about to confront my sister and risk the very relationship I treasured most, outside of the one I shared with my husband and son. And yet I had no choice. All at once I felt like weeping.</p><p>As the clich\u00e9 has it, Brad could read me like a book. When we parked in front of my sister\u2019s house, he gently took my hand. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to work out,\u201d he assured me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, okay?\u201d</p><p>I hoped he was right.</p><p>Matt opened the screen door for us even before we made it to the top step. He\u2019s a big man, tall and thick-waisted now that he\u2019d reached middle age. I remember when my sister first started dating him in high school. I\u2019d been half in love with him myself. My sister had chosen well; I liked and admired Matt.</p><p>\u201cThis is a nice surprise,\u201d Matt said, leading us into the house. He kissed me on the cheek, and he and Brad exchanged handshakes.</p><p>Margaret stepped out of the kitchen, a dish towel tossed carelessly over one shoulder. She looked instantly suspicious. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d My brother-in-law gestured toward the sofa, ignoring Margaret\u2019s lack of welcome. He turned off the television and, with his usual hospitality, offered us a drink.</p><p>We declined. Brad and I sat close to each other on the sofa. I folded my hands over my knees and waited for my husband to speak.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll excuse our coming without any advance warning,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Matt said, glancing toward Margaret. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome anytime.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, my sister sat down on the oversize chair beside Matt\u2019s recliner. A wicker basket next to the chair was filled with her knitting. I recognized the pattern; it was the prayer shawl the class had knit together. Everyone, even Colette, had finished by now. Everyone except Margaret.</p><p>\u201cLydia told me something this evening that worries her, and it involves you,\u201d Brad said. \u201cI\u2019ll let her explain.\u201d</p><p>Both Matt and Margaret turned their attention to me. I looked at Brad, wanting him to do it. But apparently it was up to me. I leaned toward my sister, silently pleading for her forgiveness.</p><p>\u201cAlix came to me the other day,\u201d I said after an awkward moment.</p><p>As soon as I mentioned Alix\u2019s name, Margaret crossed her arms and averted her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know what she told me, don\u2019t you?\u201d I asked softly.</p><p>Matt looked over at his wife, who remained stubbornly silent, her lips pursed, her eyes flashing lightning bolts at me.</p><p>This was exactly what I\u2019d feared. \u201cDo you think I care what happens to Danny Chesterfield?\u201d I blurted out, which I\u2019m sure confused my brother-in-law even more.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that creep got to do with anything?\u201d Matt demanded of his wife.</p><p>Margaret ignored him and continued to hold my gaze.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you realize you\u2019re putting your entire family at risk?\u201d I cried. \u201cYou could end up in prison!\u201d</p><p>Matt stormed to his feet. \u201cWould someone tell me what the hell\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>Brad stood, too. \u201cMargaret\u2019s trying to hire a hit man to injure Danny Chesterfield.\u201d</p><p>The room went completely still as Matt digested those words. Then, as if the weight of this was more than he could carry, he sank into his chair, leaned his head back and closed his eyes.</p><p>Margaret had yet to utter a single word.</p><p>Finally, Matt straightened and turned to his wife. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked, his voice weary and discouraged. There was no anger in his question, only pain and confusion. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you let this go?\u201d</p><p>For the first time since I\u2019d started speaking, Margaret\u2019s gaze left mine. \u201cI refuse to rest while that man walks around free to hurt someone else\u2019s daughter. Since our justice system has seen fit to release him, I don\u2019t have any choice but to take matters in my own hands.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you hired someone?\u201d Matt asked, raising his voice, something I was sure he rarely did.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d Margaret snapped. \u201cAlix wouldn\u2019t help and I didn\u2019t know anyone else to ask.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you plan to stop there?\u201d Matt pressed.</p><p>Her brief hesitation was followed by a muff led response. It sounded like \u201cno.\u201d</p><p>This didn\u2019t surprise me. When Margaret wants something done, she finds a way to make it happen.</p><p>Shocking us all, Julia stepped out of the hallway. \u201cMom! What have you done?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d hardly seen Julia since the attack and noticed the changes in her right away. She\u2019d lost weight and cut her long blond hair. While the physical injuries had healed, I knew she still struggled with the emotional damage.</p> <p>Margaret responded defensively, a typical reaction when she was caught. \u201cWere you eavesdropping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Julia didn\u2019t bother to deny it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. I heard Aunt Lydia and Brad stop by and I was coming to say hello when I heard what you\u2019d done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t concern you,\u201d Margaret said resolutely.</p><p>Julia almost laughed. \u201cHow can you say that? I\u2019m the one who was attacked. I\u2019m the one who was dragged out of that car and thrown down on the road.\u201d She paused to glare at her parents. \u201cI watched cars all around me slam on their brakes. They were trying to avoid running over me. That\u2019s what I dream about, being unable to move, paralyzed with fear on the street. The cars are all racing toward me, and they can\u2019t stop in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby.\u201d Matt stood and put his arms around his daughter.</p><p>Julia stifled a sob. \u201cMom, I can\u2019t deal with your anger anymore,\u201d she cried. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t you who went through this. It was me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand to see you hurt,\u201d Margaret said, pleading her case. \u201cI hate the man who did this to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hate him enough to destroy all our lives?\u201d Julia spun away from her father, hands tightened into fists at her sides. \u201cYour anger isn\u2019t helping me, Mom. Don\u2019t you see that? It\u2019s hurting me. Each and every day I have to deal with my own pain and yours and Dad\u2019s, too. It can\u2019t go on...it can\u2019t.\u201d She covered her face with both hands and broke into heart-wrenching sobs.</p><p>Unable to bear seeing my niece weep like that, I joined her parents, putting my arms around the three of them. When we finally broke apart, Julia sat on the ottoman next to her mother. She reached for Margaret\u2019s hand and clasped it in her own.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time we talked,\u201d Julia said, sounding more adult than any of us.</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake,\u201d Margaret admitted in a voice that was barely audible.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Julia said and shook her head dramatically. \u201cI\u2019m glad you did this, Mom, because it\u2019s brought everything to a head. That\u2019s what had to happen and so far it just hasn\u2019t. Everyone\u2019s so afraid of talking about the...accident and I need that. You and Dad need it, too. We all do,\u201d she said, looking toward the hallway.</p><p>Hailey came out from the shadows, her sweet face streaked with tears. Slowly she walked into the room and sat on the sofa with Brad and me. I drew her close and she leaned against me.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s so angry,\u201d Julia continued. \u201cWe all pretend there\u2019s nothing wrong, but there is. We can\u2019t go on ignoring the fact that I was attacked. I could easily have been killed\u2014but I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thank God you survived,\u201d Margaret whispered.</p><p>Matt nodded.</p><p>\u201cAfterward I didn\u2019t feel like I wanted to live, and you and Dad got me help. The counselor and I talked a lot. I learned that the feelings I had aren\u2019t uncommon. The counselor said lots of victims feel like I did.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m getting better now, and I\u2019ve learned so much. I want everyone to know that.\u201d</p><p>Tears spilled down Margaret\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Julia said, looking up at her mother. \u201cI was angry, too, so angry I actually wanted to die. I hated Danny Chesterfield the same way you do, but I\u2019ve seen what that anger\u2019s done to you. I\u2019ve seen what it\u2019s done to me.\u201d</p><p>Margaret nodded, wiping her face with one sleeve.</p><p>\u201cAnger takes too much energy, too much effort,\u201d Julia said.</p><p>I wondered when my niece had got so smart and realized this wisdom was a by-product of her pain.</p><p>\u201cAfter I was released from the hospital, I was obsessed with hurting him back. Thinking of ways to make him suffer was how I got through those first few weeks. I\u2019d go to sleep at night and dream about throwing him into moving traffic and watching him scramble for his life like I did. I\u2019d dream about standing there, watching him cry for help and then walking away and listening to his screams when he was hit by a car.\u201d</p><p>My sister bowed her head and instinctively I recognized that her daughter\u2019s words had struck a deep chord in Margaret.</p><p>\u201cThen one day I was with some friends,\u201d Julia said, her voice dropping. \u201cThey asked me to do Relay for Life.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at me and I nodded, remembering the wonderful time we\u2019d had together.</p><p>\u201cMy friends were raising money to save lives,\u201d Julia went on, \u201cand while they were making a positive difference, I was plotting, dreaming, thinking about vengeance.\u201d She lowered her eyes as though ashamed. \u201cI understood then that I didn\u2019t like the person I was becoming.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled my eyes and I tried to hide how intensely Julia\u2019s words had affected me. I saw that everyone else was equally touched. Julia\u2019s wisdom moved me, impressed me, and again I understood that this wisdom had come at a terrible price.</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Julia brought her mother\u2019s hand close to her own heart. \u201cI probably won\u2019t ever be the same person I was before the carjacking and in some ways, that\u2019s good. But the one I\u2019m worried about now is you.\u201d</p><p>Margaret lowered her head, unable to look her daughter in the eye.</p><p>\u201cI need you to let go of your anger because I\u2019m afraid I might never completely heal if you don\u2019t. Can you do that, Mom? Can you do it for me?\u201d</p><p>Slowly Margaret raised her head. \u201cI can try,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I ask,\u201d Julia said.</p><p>Mom and daughter hugged.</p><p>Hailey excused herself and briefly left the room, returning with a box of tissues, which we all needed. Soon we were laughing and crying at the same time. That\u2019s how it is sometimes. The laughter can be as healing as tears.</p><p>Brad and I went home soon afterward and Margaret walked us to the door.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. It came as a surprise when she hugged me. Before she stepped back, she said close to my ear, \u201cI\u2019m going to be all right now.\u201d</p><p>I knew it was true. We all would.</p><p>CHAPTER 36</p><p>Alix Townsend</p><p>The morning of June second, Alix woke up and remembered that this was her wedding day. She felt a sense of profound joy\u2014but it was a joy mingled with sheer terror. Standing up in front of all those people, even though there\u2019d be far fewer than the number originally invited, terrified her. But despite her fears, she wanted to do this, more than anything in her life. She loved Jordan and knew he loved her, but she wasn\u2019t unrealistic about marriage; love didn\u2019t mean there wouldn\u2019t be conflicts and problems. The difference was that if you loved each other, the way she and Jordan did, you could resolve those conflicts and find solutions to the problems.</p><p>Alix was too nervous and excited to have breakfast. At nine, Tammie Lee drove her to Grandma Turner\u2019s house, which was already stirring with activity.</p><p>Reese and Jacqueline had canceled the orchestra they\u2019d hired for the country club reception; with Alix and Jordan\u2019s permission, they\u2019d arranged for a five-piece band instead. The sound system people were getting everything set up.</p><p>The tent was raised, and the folding chairs stood inside in neat rows. Jacqueline had insisted on white wooden chairs with padded seats at a cost Alix didn\u2019t even want to think about. The caterers had arrived and were preparing the food. The French Caf\u00e9 had delivered the wedding cake, a traditional cake Alix had baked and decorated herself. As a surprise for Jacqueline, she\u2019d used a sweetened cream cheese frosting.</p><p>Susannah and Colette were there, too, working on the flower arrangements. They were filling large baskets with white roses, yellow daisies and sprigs of fern. Smaller bouquets of the same flowers were attached at the end of every row. The effect was simple, springlike and elegant.</p><p>The minute Alix caught sight of Colette, she flew across the grounds. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here,\u201d Alix murmured, throwing both arms around her. The last Alix had heard, Christian still hadn\u2019t been located. Colette had kept a vigil with Christian\u2019s aunt since his disappearance became known, and Alix hadn\u2019t expected her to come to the wedding.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it,\u201d Colette assured her, hugging her back.</p><p>\u201cChristian?\u201d Alix whispered.</p><p>Colette shook her head. \u201cNothing new.\u201d She looked tired but seemed to have found some measure of peace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you came,\u201d Alix said. \u201cIt means a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>Colette smiled at her. \u201cOh, Alix, you\u2019re going to be a beautiful bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to be married.\u201d Alix giggled with happiness and headed toward the house, where Jacqueline and Reese were waiting for her. Family drifted in and out; someone had brought a large coffee urn and Jordan\u2019s relatives came in to help themselves to cups of coffee. Someone mentioned that Grandma Turner had decided to rest for a while. Alix didn\u2019t want to disturb her.</p><p>\u201cThe hairdresser\u2019s here,\u201d Jacqueline announced, ushering Alix into the house.</p><p>Alix glanced at her warily.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Jacqueline must have read the look in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not Desiree.\u201d Early in their friendship, Jacqueline had taken her to an expensive hairstylist named Desiree; this was the famous makeover disaster they still laughed about. \u201cDesiree said I couldn\u2019t pay her enough to work on your hair again.\u201d</p><p>Alix grinned. Desiree wouldn\u2019t want to hear what she thought of her, either. \u201cJust as long as I have final approval.\u201d She wasn\u2019t about to go through her wedding looking like one of the boys from that 1970s TV series, The Brady Bunch.</p><p>Jacqueline nodded and led her to the bathroom. In short order her hair was washed and blow-dried, curled and sprayed. Alix stared at her ref lection and decided she rather liked this more mature version of herself.</p><p>\u201cIs Grandma Turner still resting?\u201d she asked. Any number of people had been in and out of the house all morning.</p><p>No one seemed to know. Her bedroom door remained shut. Alix had brought over her wedding dress earlier in the week and Grandma had insisted on hanging it on the back of her door.</p><p>Still in her housecoat and slippers, Alix approached the bedroom. Her knock went unanswered. If Grandma Turner was sleeping, it was time to wake her. The photographer would be there soon and Alix wanted Grandma in the pictures. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After knocking a second time, Alix quietly opened the door, to see Jordan\u2019s grandmother sitting in the rocking chair by her bed, her Bible in her lap. The shawl Alix had knit was draped around her shoulders. It looked as if the old woman had been reading her Bible and fallen asleep.</p><p>\u201cGrandma,\u201d Alix whispered, trying not to startle her.</p><p>Sarah Turner didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Kneeling in front of her, Alix reached for Sarah\u2019s hand and swallowed hard when she discovered the fingers were stone-cold.</p> <p>Alix knew that Grandma wasn\u2019t asleep.</p><p>She was dead.</p><p>She\u2019d died that morning, reading her Bible and wearing her prayer shawl.</p><p>Sobs filled Alix\u2019s chest and she laid her face against Grandma\u2019s lap as she struggled for composure. When she could breathe evenly again, she lifted her face, gently touched the old woman\u2019s cheek and rose to her feet.</p><p>Alix stepped quietly out of the bedroom, closing the door behind her. The first person she saw was Jacqueline.</p> <p>\u201cPlease find Jordan for me,\u201d she whispered brokenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Jacqueline asked.</p><p>\u201cJust get Jordan. Please.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline started to tell her it was bad luck for the groom to see his bride before the wedding, but Alix\u2019s expression obviously stopped her. \u201cI saw him a little while ago. I\u2019ll look around.\u201d</p><p>She left, returning with him a few minutes later. Jordan frowned when he saw Alix still wearing her housecoat and slippers. He was in his tuxedo. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Alix nodded and took his hand. Together they entered his grandmother\u2019s bedroom. Jordan knew instantly.</p> <p>\u201cI think she\u2019s been dead a couple of hours,\u201d Alix told him. Her voice faltered, and when she could speak again, she asked in a hoarse whisper, \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p><p>Jordan sat on the edge of his grandmother\u2019s bed and lowered his head as the realization hit him. \u201cMy grandmother loved you, Alix. I don\u2019t know why the Lord chose to take her home this morning, but He did. Everyone\u2019s here. It seems to me that this was exactly what Grandma was waiting for\u2014to see us happy and to have all her family around her. We\u2019re getting married today. Grandma would want us to. Her love is here.\u201d</p><p>Jordan stood and wrapped his arms around Alix, then briefly buried his face in her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll tell my parents.\u201d</p><p>While Jordan went in search of his family, Alix removed her wedding dress from his grandmother\u2019s door and slipped into it. She went out into the kitchen, beckoning to Jacqueline and Tammie Lee. They found a private corner, and while she explained the circumstances, Tammie Lee fastened the buttons in the back of Alix\u2019s dress.</p><p>Larry and Susan Turner rushed into the house and Jordan brought them to the bedroom, where Alix joined them a few minutes later. Jordan\u2019s mother had dissolved into tears.</p><p>Jordan placed his hand on his father\u2019s shoulder as Larry slumped on the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the wedding?\u201d Susan jerked up her head. \u201cWe can\u2019t cancel it at the last second like this. We\u2019ve already canceled it once and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s all right. Alix and I have decided to go through with the ceremony.\u201d</p> <p>His mother sniff led loudly and nodded.</p><p>\u201cShe went so peacefully,\u201d Larry whispered. He looked down at his mother, her Bible open on her lap, and a fleeting smile touched his lips. \u201cWhen my time comes, I want to leave this earth just the way she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Larry,\u201d Susan cried. \u201cHow can you say that? You\u2019d think your mother could have timed it better, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t make those decisions, Susan,\u201d her husband reminded her. \u201cIt was God\u2019s timing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care whose timing it was, it was bad.\u201d</p><p>Larry simply shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAre you up to performing the ceremony?\u201d Jordan asked him.</p><p>Larry nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have the wedding with your mother\u2019s body in the bedroom!\u201d Susan dabbed at her eyes with a tissue she\u2019d extracted from her purse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll contact the sheriff,\u201d Alix said, taking control. She could tell that Jordan\u2019s family had all they could do to deal with their shock and grief. \u201cThe sheriff will send the coroner.\u201d</p><p>As Alix talked to the sheriff\u2019s office, Jordan\u2019s family\u2014his older brother, Bret, his uncles, aunts and cousins\u2014came to bid their grandmother farewell. How ironic that a day meant for joy should be so full of sorrow...and then joy.</p><p>The sheriff\u2019s patrol car arrived at the same time as the musicians. The rows of chairs had started to fill up with wedding guests.</p><p>Alix met the sheriff, whose badge identified him as Lyle Carson, and led him inside the house. The bedroom was crowded with weeping family members. She could only imagine what it must look like, a bride in her dress and gown leading him to the body.</p><p>He removed his hat and asked Alix a few questions, as she seemed to be the only one capable of answering. The coroner came shortly afterward and it was Alix who answered his questions, too.</p><p>While he examined the body, Alix ushered everyone out of the bedroom and directed them to join the other guests.</p><p>\u201cLarry,\u201d she said to her soon-to-be father-in-law, \u201cyou need to go to the tent now with Jordan and Bret.\u201d Bret had flown in from California and was standing up as Jordan\u2019s best man. \u201cI suggest you tell our guests what\u2019s happened. Perhaps you should call for a moment of silence and then say a prayer.\u201d</p><p>Larry nodded and followed her instructions.</p><p>Taking Susan\u2019s hand, Alix guided her out of the room, whispering reassurances as she went. Jacqueline came to their side, and Alix asked her to help Susan repair her makeup.</p><p>The rest of the family moved slowly toward the tent.</p><p>The photographer wandered aimlessly around, looking confused and uncertain. \u201cTake a bunch of random shots of the wedding,\u201d Alix told him. \u201cAs much as possible, avoid getting any of the emergency vehicles.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Colette approached her. \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for asking, but I can\u2019t think of a thing.\u201d</p><p>The musicians began to play the wedding march and Colette gave her a swift hug. \u201cGo,\u201d she said with a warm smile. \u201cYou\u2019re about to become a bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour guests have been apprised of the circumstances,\u201d Reese whispered when he met Alix outside the tent. \u201cIt was handled beautifully by Jordan\u2019s father.\u201d He offered her his arm as he prepared to escort her down the aisle. His smile revealed his pride. \u201cI have to say, Alix Townsend, you\u2019re really something. I don\u2019t know of anyone who could\u2019ve dealt with this crisis as well as you have.\u201d</p><p>Alix smiled shakily. The music continued and with her head held high, she walked toward her groom.</p><p>On her side of the aisle were all the people Alix loved. Lydia, Brad and Cody, who squirmed until he saw her and then waved frantically. Carol, Doug and Cameron sat in the second row. This was the first time Alix had seen her friend in a maternity dress. Elise and Maverick were there, and Bethanne and Annie, along with Susannah, Joe, Chrissie and Colette. She saw her friends from the French Caf\u00e9, too.</p><p>Alix could hardly believe how many friends she\u2019d made these last few years. It\u2019d all begun the day she\u2019d impulsively crossed Blossom Street and signed up for a knitting class. Who would\u2019ve guessed that such a simple decision would forever change her life?</p><p>As she stood beside Jordan and they exchanged their vows, Alix saw the love in her husband\u2019s eyes and knew it was a ref lection of her own. As soon as the ceremony was over, Jordan kissed her. His father announced them as Mr. and Mrs. Jordan Turner, and there was a moment of sustained applause.</p><p>Everyone made an effort to celebrate, despite the sadness of that morning. They enjoyed the meal, the music, the conversation with family and friends. At around 7:00 p.m. Alix and Jordan were leaving for Victoria, British Columbia, where they\u2019d have a two-day honeymoon.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure we should go?\u201d Alix asked after they\u2019d cut the cake and made a final round of their guests.</p><p>\u201cWe should,\u201d he insisted. \u201cDad and I talked it over, and we decided to hold Grandma\u2019s funeral on Tuesday, the day after we get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Under no circumstances did Alix want to miss it.</p><p>As she changed out of her wedding dress and into comfortable traveling clothes, Susan Turner joined her.</p><p>\u201cOh, Alix,\u201d she whispered and snapped open her purse to search for another tissue. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we would\u2019ve done without you today.\u201d</p><p>Alix was uncomfortable with the praise.</p><p>\u201cYou took care of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d Susan touched her arm. \u201cYou kept your head, you held the family together, you and Jordan made crucial, on-the-spot decisions.\u201d</p><p>Alix shifted from one foot to the other. \u201cSpeaking of Jordan, I\u2019d better go find my husband.\u201d Calling Jordan her husband for the first time seemed momentous to Alix. Until now, the meaning of that word had been abstract, impersonal, describing a role, not a man.</p><p>Now it meant Jordan.</p><p>Husband.</p><p>Alix had never realized how intimate it sounded. Intimate and yet public\u2014a declaration of love and belonging.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t keep you.\u201d Susan hugged her tightly. \u201cI hope we can be very good friends, Alix.\u201d</p><p>Alix hugged her in return. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to have a mother,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>CHAPTER 37</p><p>Colette Blake</p><p>After Alix and Jordan\u2019s wedding, Colette returned exhausted to Elizabeth\u2019s home. They had a quiet dinner of shrimp salad later that evening. Neither of them spoke much. With every day that passed, their hope diminished. It was only a little after nine when Colette excused herself and climbed up the stairs to bed.</p><p>Surprisingly, she fell asleep almost right away, only to be awakened abruptly by Elizabeth at around ten. \u201cColette,\u201d the older woman said excitedly, coming into the bedroom and turning on the overhead light. \u201cChristian\u2019s been found! He\u2019s alive!\u201d</p><p>Colette immediately sat up and blinked against the bright light and the shock.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on the phone,\u201d Elizabeth told her.</p><p>\u201cYou mean now?\u201d Colette cried, thinking this must be part of some wonderful dream.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes! He\u2019s waiting to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God, thank God.\u201d Tearing aside the sheets, Colette leaped out of bed and raced down the stairs so fast her bare feet slipped on the carpeted steps. Breathlessly, she grabbed the hallway phone.</p><p>\u201cChristian? Christian!\u201d</p><p>\u201cColette?\u201d He sounded as if he was phoning from the moon. She heard an echo, and his voice seemed tinny and distant.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, it\u2019s me! Are you all right? Where are you?\u201d She dashed away tears of relief and joy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he said, \u201cand anxious to get home. I\u2019ll land tomorrow night. Will you be there? I have so much to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019ll come to the airport. What time?\u201d</p><p>He gave her the airline and flight number while she frantically searched for a pen and paper to write it down. When she had all the details, she repeated them back to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there, Christian. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow....\u201d She was so excited now she doubted she\u2019d sleep again.</p><p>\u201cColette, listen,\u201d he said, speaking quickly. \u201cI know I\u2019m throwing this at you out of the blue, but I need to tell you something important. I\u2019m not involved in smuggling. I couldn\u2019t tell you before, but the INS sent me to China. We were cooperating with the Chinese government. I was supposed to make contact with some smugglers. Get evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian, tell me later. As long as you\u2019re safe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t spend another second having you believe I\u2019m a criminal! Colette, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>There was a burst of static on the line, cutting him off.</p><p>Colette wanted to scream with frustration. \u201cRepeat that,\u201d she pleaded when he came back on. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go. I love you, Colette. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she cried. The connection was completely broken then, but she held the receiver against her ear, letting his parting words settle over her. He loved her.</p><p>After a few minutes, she reluctantly hung up the phone and turned to find Elizabeth standing at the top of the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cChristian\u2019s coming home!\u201d she shouted. \u201cHe\u2019s safe!\u201d That was by far the most important news. Christian who\u2019d been lost had now been found, and even better, he\u2019d soon be on a plane and flying home. \u201cHe told me he\u2019s working with the INS\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI learned that, too,\u201d his great-aunt interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYour sources...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t get a thing out of them,\u201d she muttered, shaking her head as if to say it was a sad state of affairs when the government didn\u2019t trust her with its business.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s safe,\u201d Colette repeated simply to hear the words again. \u201cHe\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope he realizes he\u2019s put us both through hell,\u201d Elizabeth said briskly.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it was hardly his fault,\u201d Colette murmured. Then she smiled, and because it was impossible to hold back the words any longer, she cried, \u201cHe loves me.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth sighed impatiently. \u201cI already told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but he said it to me himself.\u201d That made all the difference.</p><p>The old woman nodded and a slow smile creased her face. She looked more than a little pleased with herself. \u201cPerhaps international intrigue has its uses, after all.\u201d She raised her eyebrows. \u201cAn experience like that would make a person appreciate what\u2014or should I say whom\u2014he\u2019s got at home.\u201d</p><p>Twenty hours later, Colette and Elizabeth were at Sea-Tac Airport, waiting outside the secure area for Christian and his father to clear customs. Their flight had landed on time and without incident, according to the monitors. Colette should know; she\u2019d checked them often enough.</p><p>Colette paced while Elizabeth sat restlessly. \u201cWhat could be taking them so long?\u201d his great-aunt complained. \u201cI\u2019m an old woman and these seats are a form of torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with his father, you said.\u201d Colette remembered Elizabeth\u2019s telling her that their relationship had been strained for years.</p><p>\u201cI assume so,\u201d Elizabeth said irritably. \u201cHow am I supposed to know all this? I assume they\u2019re flying back on the same flight. If so, that\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019re speaking. Both of them are stubborn fools.\u201d</p> <p>All Colette could do was pray that this misadventure had torn down the walls between father and son. She knew only a little about their history but enough to gather that their estrangement had hurt them both.</p><p>People started to emerge from the customs area a few at a time and then finally the door opened and Elliott Dempsey stepped out, followed by his son. Christian looked thin and tired and badly in need of a shave.</p><p>Christian immediately searched for Colette. She hurried forward, and the biggest smile she\u2019d ever seen appeared on his face. He held out his arms.</p><p>Without a pause, Colette walked into his embrace. For the longest moment all they did was cling to each other. Then he kissed her, his hands cradling her face, his mouth moving over hers. Soon she was crying, her relief overwhelming even her joy. Christian kissed her cheeks, her tears, his unshaven face scraping her skin as they rocked back and forth in each other\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cHello, Aunt Elizabeth,\u201d he said after a few minutes, speaking over Colette\u2019s shoulder, still holding her against him.</p><p>\u201cGlad to see you, too, young man,\u201d she said with her customary curtness. \u201cI hope you know this nonsense of yours cost me ten years of my life. I\u2019m too old to worry like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Aunt Betty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Elizabeth and you well know it.\u201d</p><p>With her arm around Christian\u2019s waist, Colette turned to find Elizabeth glaring at him with tears in her eyes.</p><p>Christian released Colette and wrapped his aunt in a fierce embrace, lifting her off the ground.</p><p>\u201cPut me down this minute,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYes, Aunt Betty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling me that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Anything else I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth glanced at Colette and then back at her great-nephew. \u201cAs a matter of fact, you can. Marry this woman.\u201d Her gaze shifted to meet Colette\u2019s. \u201cSoon, if you know what\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElizabeth,\u201d Colette chided, flushing with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it under advisement,\u201d Christian said, smiling down at Colette.</p><p>Elliott approached them, dragging a small suitcase. Introductions were quickly made, and Colette studied the older man. So this was Christian\u2019s father. Despite his rumpled clothes and unshaven appearance, he had a dignity that impressed her.</p><p>Somehow, the news had gotten out to the press, and as soon as they walked into the main part of the terminal, the small group was bombarded with reporters. The flashes from a dozen cameras nearly blinded Colette, who put her hands in front of her face. Questions were fired at Christian, one after another. He answered a few, then authoritatively steered Colette, his aunt and father toward the car that awaited them.</p><p>Elizabeth and Elliott sat on one side of the stretch limo; Christian and Colette sat opposite them.</p><p>While his great-aunt and father spoke quietly, Christian whispered in her ear. \u201cCome home with me.\u201d His hand gripped hers. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She needed him, too.</p><p>When the vehicle stopped at his great-aunt\u2019s home, Colette ran in to collect her things. Elizabeth watched her climb back into the car, a disapproving glint in her eyes. \u201cMake sure there\u2019s a ring on your finger before you give him what he wants,\u201d she said loudly enough for Christian to hear.</p><p>\u201cYes, Aunt Betty,\u201d she teased, and when the older woman frowned, Colette gave her a big hug.</p><p>During the short drive from his aunt\u2019s house to his father\u2019s, it became apparent that Christian and Elliott\u2019s relationship had come a long way. They spoke to each other with affection and familiarity, laughing more than once. Christian walked his father to the front door and she watched as the two men exchanged first handshakes and then hugs.</p><p>Christian was silent when he returned to the vehicle. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d survive this, Colette. All I could think about was getting back to you.\u201d He reached for her hand again, entwining their fingers. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be dangerous, you know. The government\u2019s occasionally used other businessmen to do this sort of thing in the past. All I had to do was meet with the smugglers\u2014pretend to work with them. A setup, in other words. Then two of them kidnapped me in Beijing and took me to a small rural town in Shanxi province. I still don\u2019t know how they found out. But somehow they were on to me\u2014\u201d He shuddered visibly.</p><p>\u201cTell me the rest later,\u201d Colette said. \u201cThe only thing that matters right now is that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>They arrived at the house and Christian let them inside. Closing the door, he gathered her in his arms and kissed her until she thought she\u2019d faint with longing and need.</p><p>Christian rested his chin on the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted. I feel like I could sleep for a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Colette nodded. \u201cGo to bed now.\u201d</p><p>Christian leaned back, looking directly into her eyes. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>The temptation was as strong as a riptide. But she shook her head, slowly, regretfully. \u201cWe have to talk first.\u201d</p><p>His disappointment was obvious.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d she suggested, \u201cand when you wake, I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>He seemed about to argue with her. Instead, he murmured \u201cGood night,\u201d and disappeared into a room at the end of the hallway. She checked on him an hour later and discovered he was dead to the world. He lay stretched out on the covers, still wearing his clothes.</p><p>Colette opened windows to let in the mild June air and disperse the stuffiness of a house that had been shut up for more than three weeks. She found a can of soup in the kitchen, heated that for dinner and phoned Elizabeth to assure the old woman that her morals were safe.</p><p>\u201cYou tell him he has to marry you,\u201d Elizabeth insisted.</p><p>Colette planned to do no such thing.</p><p>She slept in a spare room and woke at about seven the next morning, when she heard Christian rummaging in the kitchen. After dressing, she joined him. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she said cheerfully.</p><p>She was glad to see that he looked rested. His hair was damp, he\u2019d shaved and wore black slacks and a teal sweater, which highlighted his blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou must be starved,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he agreed, \u201cbut before I do anything\u2014other than have a coffee\u2014I want us to talk.\u201d</p><p>Colette hadn\u2019t expected it to happen this soon and she wasn\u2019t ready for it. \u201cLet\u2019s sit down,\u201d she said. He\u2019d made a pot of coffee and carried his mug over to the table. She located tea bags and heated water in his microwave.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Colette,\u201d he said, just as she took the chair opposite his.</p><p>Her lips trembled as she savored his words. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of things happened before I left for China,\u201d he said. He took her hand in his.</p><p>\u201cWho were those men that night?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to clarify her question. \u201cThe evening before I flew into China,\u201d he said, \u201cI met with a group of government agents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose men were with the government?\u201d Colette remembered the two Asian men and had assumed they were involved with the smuggling. Instead they worked for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</p><p>\u201cJust before Christmas, I was approached by some of my contacts\u2014here and in China\u2014about being part of their smuggling operation. They had a system all worked out and wanted to include me. They thought I could manage to get them some sort of cover through my importing business. I went to the INS, who asked me to follow through. Or pretend to, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>Colette tightened her fingers around his. \u201cYou took a very big risk,\u201d she said in a tearful voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grimaced. \u201cI knew people were being exploited. I didn\u2019t feel I had much choice. However, I couldn\u2019t tell anyone\u2014like you. For everyone\u2019s protection, this had to be completely covert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you finally get out? Did you escape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t\u2014they watched me day and night. I was in some kind of makeshift prison for two weeks. What a hellhole! I could even hear my guards arguing about the best way to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Colette was horrified at the thought. He would never have been seen or heard of again; she would never have known what had happened to him.</p> <p>\u201cI think the reason they didn\u2019t murder me right away,\u201d he went on, \u201cis that I\u2019m a fairly well-known businessman, and there might be repercussions if I simply disappeared. Still...I knew I probably wouldn\u2019t see you again. I expected to die, and just when I\u2019d given up all hope, I was rescued by a coalition of American military and Chinese police.\u201d</p><p>Colette gave him a puzzled glance. She\u2019d combed the newspapers for any information to do with China and hadn\u2019t seen a single mention of the undercover operation. \u201cThere was nothing about it in the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be. The government wants to keep it quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor obvious reasons,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Christian nodded.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the anonymous letter I wrote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will say that letter stirred up a bit of interest,\u201d Christian said with a grin. \u201cIf anything, though, it worked to my advantage. It deflected any suspicion the smugglers might have had\u2014at least the ones in North America.\u201d He gave her a solemn look, all traces of his smile gone. \u201cI hated deceiving you, Colette, but I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d hated deceiving him just as much; like Christian, she didn\u2019t feel there was any option. She\u2019d had to keep the baby a secret from him.</p><p>They moved into the living room; when he chose the sofa, clearly expecting her to sit there, too, she sat in a spindly antique chair across from him.</p><p>\u201cIs anything wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>When she shook her head, he frowned. \u201cThen why are you over there and not next to me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I have something important to tell you and I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re going to react.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said after a brief hesitation, \u201cmaybe you\u2019d better tell me now.\u201d</p><p>She braced herself, struggling to come up with the right words. In the end she just told the truth, without explanation or embellishment. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>The color drained from his face. The longest minute of her life passed before he responded. \u201cIs the baby Steve\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head again, then looked up and held his gaze. \u201cThe baby\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>If she thought he was pale before, it didn\u2019t compare to the shock that showed on his face now. \u201cI...asked,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cAfter that night, I came to you and asked if you were pregnant, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I lied. I\u2019d found what I felt sure was damning evidence against you. I was afraid I couldn\u2019t trust you. All I could think of was to get away.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cThat explains so much.\u201d Still holding her gaze, he said, \u201cI love you, Colette. I want our baby. I understand why you kept this from me, but please say you believe me now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I prove to you that I\u2019ll be a good husband and father? Just tell me and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>An involuntary smile came then, because she\u2019d never dared hope Christian would want their baby, let alone her. Only in the last month had she begun to feel there might be a chance for them.</p><p>\u201cWhat you found on my computer was only part of the reason you resigned, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Not trusting herself to speak, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe baby played a role in that decision, too.\u201d</p><p>Again she nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen you sold your house and moved because you didn\u2019t want me to find you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you did track me down,\u201d she pointed out, \u201cand for someone with your resources, that couldn\u2019t have been too difficult.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI wanted a fresh start, a new life for me and the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2014that\u2019s why you came to see me the night before I left for China?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, and because I\u2019d fallen in love with you.\u201d Colette smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s why your aunt was trying to be a matchmaker. But by then, I\u2019d decided I had to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Elizabeth knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree people know\u2014my friend Alix, your aunt Elizabeth and now you. I admitted it to your great-aunt the first time we met.\u201d She\u2019d never intended to, but such were Elizabeth\u2019s powers of persuasion...\u201cAll these months I\u2019d kept this secret to myself. Not even my parents know. Then I met your aunt...and she figured it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood old Aunt Betty.\u201d It was Christian who smiled this time. \u201cNo wonder she demanded I marry you.\u201d He straightened with a startled expression. \u201cI\u2019d want to marry you, with or without the baby. A child\u2014our child\u2014is a bonus I never anticipated.\u201d He looked at her carefully. \u201cYou\u2019re six months along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive and a half. My due date\u2019s September twenty-first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought...you know, that you might\u2019ve put on a few pounds, but I never guessed this. I...\u201d</p><p>She sat beside him and reached for his hand, which she placed on her stomach. Their child responded as if on cue. The look of astonishment on Christian\u2019s face made her giggle. And then he smiled with such unreserved love and pride and joy, it brought tears to her eyes.</p><p>Holding her in his arms, he kissed her again and again, pausing only long enough to beg her to marry him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she told him, kissing him back.</p><p>\u201cSoon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d she promised.</p><p>CHAPTER 38</p><p>\u201cCreating and processing exotic yarns has given new meaning to adding fiber to my diet.\u201d</p><p>Kathy Haneke, Haneke Enterprises, Inc., yarn shop and fiber processing mil</p><p>Lydia Goetz</p><p>I\u2019d hoped that after Brad and I confronted my sister, there\u2019d be a marked change in Margaret\u2019s attitude toward Danny Chesterfield. My niece had made such a poignant plea to her mother that I couldn\u2019t see Margaret ignoring Julia\u2019s feelings.</p><p>Julia had impressed me with her insight, and what she\u2019d said revealed wisdom far beyond her years. Julia knew she couldn\u2019t heal until her mother let go of her hatred; she couldn\u2019t move forward in her own life until Margaret did the same.</p><p>Unfortunately, I hadn\u2019t seen the change I\u2019d hoped for in Margaret. This didn\u2019t completely surprise me, since my sister is rarely effusive. I hardly ever know what she\u2019s thinking, unless it\u2019s negative. Then there\u2019s never any doubt. The first day I opened for business was a good example of that. Margaret marched in and told me A Good Yarn was doomed to failure. After that cheery announcement, she promptly left.</p><p>I\u2019ll never forget her dire prediction (which of course didn\u2019t come to pass). I also recall, just as vividly, the day I realized how much my sister loves me. A few months after I opened the yarn store, I had a cancer scare. Scare is a mild word to describe what I felt. Panic is more like it.</p><p>I was in the hospital. Margaret, who hates hospitals, came to see me and dragged Brad in with her. In my hopelessness and despair, I\u2019d broken up with Brad, but she simply would not believe I didn\u2019t want to see him again. So she\u2019d taken matters into her own hands. That was a love so clearly spelled out I couldn\u2019t disregard it.</p><p>If I were to look for a turning point in our relationship, I\u2019d have to say that was it. She wept with me when I learned I was cancer-free. In some ways, I think she was more relieved than I was. You see, I\u2019d already made my decision. If the cancer had returned for the third time, I was going to refuse treatment.</p><p>It all seems rather melodramatic now. Thankfully, the decision was taken away from me and the truth of it is that I don\u2019t really know if I would\u2019ve followed through. To refuse treatment meant almost certain death. No matter what I said, a part of me, even during the worst of the chemo, wanted to live. And now there\u2019s no doubt at all about the decision I\u2019d make if cancer ambushes me again.</p><p>It was Tuesday, and I\u2019d arrived at the shop early to pay bills and take care of some paperwork.</p><p>A lot had been happening recently. First, there was Alix and Jordan\u2019s wedding. Alix had looked lovely, so happy. But shortly before the ceremony, Pastor Turner, Jordan\u2019s father, announced that his mother had died that morning. He\u2019d told us she had her family there, gathered around her, and how she was ready for death. His prayer was moving and what might have been a tragedy became a celebration as Alix and Jordan exchanged their vows and honored a woman they both loved.</p><p>Colette had mysteriously gone missing after the wedding, although I saw on the news that Christian Dempsey was back, and I suspected they were together. I caught a glimpse of her during the impromptu press conference at the airport on Monday. She was standing to the side and her eyes never left his face. I had to wonder if there was another wedding in the making.</p><p>Mom was nicely settled in at the memory care facility and had made yet another major adjustment. Every day I marveled at the transformation in her since she\u2019d started getting the kind of individual care she needed. In barely two weeks, she\u2019d improved noticeably, joining in the center\u2019s activities and having meals with the other residents.</p><p>The door opened at ten and Margaret walked into the store. She slapped the morning paper on the corner of my desk, where I\u2019d been sitting with my cup of tea and a stack of bills.</p><p>\u201cDid you read this?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d I\u2019d glanced at the headlines but little else. \u201cI scanned the front page. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook in Section B.\u201d Margaret handed it to me. Arms crossed, she stepped back and waited.</p><p>It was all the routine local stuff\u2014break-ins, accidents, police activities. Not wanting to admit I couldn\u2019t find what she wanted me to read, I shrugged.</p><p>Margaret rolled her eyes, then pointed to a small article at the bottom of the page.</p><p>Two lines into the piece, I read the name Danny Chesterfield.</p><p>\u201cHe was caught,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d There was no disguising the glee in Margaret\u2019s voice. \u201cHe pulled another carjacking, only this time there was a patrol car driving past. Danny Boy pushed the driver out of the way and took off. The cops chased him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe decided to make a run for it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd put several innocent bystanders at risk,\u201d Margaret said. \u201cFortunately, no one, including the driver, was injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t get away, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Margaret replied, hardly able to contain her delight, \u201cand the one involved in an accident was none other than Mr. Chesterfield himself.\u201d</p><p>My attention returned to the article. Apparently Chesterfield swerved in order to avoid a head-on collision with a second police car, lost control of the vehicle and flipped over at least twice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be released for lack of evidence this time,\u201d Margaret said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to get someone to give him an alibi, either.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and continued reading. \u201cIt also says he\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I hope he\u2019s in a lot of pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargaret!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you want me to lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but a little compassion wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompassion?\u201d Margaret repeated. \u201cI have as much compassion for him as he did for my daughter.\u201d</p><p>I refolded the newspaper and gave it back to my sister. I\u2019d really hoped Margaret had listened to Julia, but evidently not.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d she muttered.</p> <p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m a big disappointment to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Margaret,\u201d I said, growing tired of the discussion. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a disappointment. I don\u2019t have any love for Danny Chesterfield either, you know. He hurt Julia and his actions have affected our entire family. Even Mom\u2019s sensed that something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe article said he\u2019s in serious but stable condition.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d read that, too. \u201cHe\u2019ll live,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cBetter yet, he\u2019s going to jail.\u201d</p> <p>I had to agree; learning Danny Chesterfield would soon be incarcerated didn\u2019t bother me any.</p><p>\u201cYou know what Julia said when I told her?\u201d Margaret asked. She didn\u2019t wait for a response. \u201cJulia said revenge wasn\u2019t for us to exact. Danny Chesterfield will pay for his crimes. In our justice system or a higher one...\u201d</p><p>Once again, I felt there was much my sister could learn from her daughter.</p><p>The subject of Danny Chesterfield wasn\u2019t brought up even once as we charged through our day. Margaret turned over the Closed sign to read Open, flipped on all the lights and stopped to pet Whiskers, who\u2019d taken his spot in the display window.</p><p>No sooner had she unfastened the lock than our first customer arrived. I hadn\u2019t finished with my paperwork, so Margaret waited on her.</p><p>Even at the best of times Margaret isn\u2019t a chatty person, but as the day wore on I noticed that she seemed quieter than usual. I knew our brief conversation that morning weighed on her mind. Frankly, it did on mine, too.</p><p>John F. Kennedy is reported to have said that we can forgive our enemies but we shouldn\u2019t forget their names. I wasn\u2019t forgetting Danny Chesterfield anytime soon, but to the best of my ability I\u2019d forgiven him. I don\u2019t mean to sound like some spiritual giant who could magnanimously offer this man my pardon. For one thing, I had far less to forgive than my sister. Julia was my niece, not my daughter. This man had put Margaret and Matt through hell when he hurt Julia.</p><p>Toward the end of the afternoon, Margaret approached me. I\u2019d returned to my office to complete some orders. \u201cCan you come with me after work?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>I assumed she wanted the two of us to visit Mom. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Margaret nodded and offered me a smile that wasn\u2019t quite a smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I almost asked, \u201cFor what?\u201d Margaret was thanking me? That was a rare occurrence.</p><p>\u201cYou were talking about going to visit Mom, weren\u2019t you?\u201d I pressed, suddenly unsure.</p><p>Margaret shook her head. \u201cNo, actually I was thinking of going to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes I can be a little slow, but for the life of me I couldn\u2019t recall who we knew in the hospital. My confusion must have shown on my face because Margaret walked over to my desk, picked up the folded newspaper and waved it in front of me.</p><p>\u201cYou want to visit Danny Chesterfield?\u201d I asked, so astonished I could barely get the words out.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to change your mind, are you?\u201d</p><p>My immediate reaction was to do exactly that. I had absolutely no desire to see Danny Chesterfield. He probably had no desire to see Margaret and me, either.</p><p>\u201cWhat possible good will that do?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming or not?\u201d she demanded. \u201cA simple yes or no will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, suit yourself,\u201d she snapped, walking quickly as if she couldn\u2019t get away from me fast enough.</p><p>I took a couple of minutes to consider before I followed her. \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d I said in as neutral a voice as I could manage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do me any favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I told her, although this definitely felt like one.</p><p>While Margaret was busy helping a customer, I called Brad on his cell phone and told him I\u2019d be home a bit later than usual and why.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing what?\u201d he said when I\u2019d explained Margaret\u2019s request. \u201cDo you really think this is a wise idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich? Margaret visiting Danny Chesterfield or me going with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answered honestly.</p><p>For a moment I thought Brad was going to try to dissuade me, but he didn\u2019t. I was grateful for that because I wasn\u2019t sure what I would\u2019ve done if he\u2019d asked me not to go.</p><p>After Margaret and I closed up shop for the day, we decided to leave my vehicle in the parking area. Margaret could drive, since it seemed pointless to take two cars, especially during rush-hour traffic.</p><p>The first place we went was the information desk at Harbor-view, the hospital where, according to the paper, Chesterfield had been taken. The clerk there checked her computer. \u201cDaniel Chesterfield was brought in two days ago by an emergency medical vehicle and released to local authorities this morning.\u201d</p><p>Margaret nodded.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have a clue what that could mean. \u201cIn other words, he\u2019s in jail now?\u201d Apparently his injuries weren\u2019t significant enough to keep him hospitalized.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the King County Medical Facility at the jail,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Margaret said, and together we hurried out of the hospital.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s that,\u201d I said, glad of the reprieve. I didn\u2019t understand why Margaret wanted to visit this criminal in the first place.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to the King County Jail,\u201d Margaret announced when we got back in the car.</p><p>I\u2019d hoped she\u2019d drop this and should have known better. \u201cThey won\u2019t let us see him,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy are we doing this, anyway?\u201d</p><p>My sister ignored me. She was on a mission, which did not include informing me of her reasons. And little things like steel bars and gun-toting guards weren\u2019t about to slow her down.</p><p>Finding a parking spot and getting into the facility wasn\u2019t a task for the weak-willed. I was astonished by all the regulations we had to observe just to talk to an official.</p><p>When we finally met with a corrections officer, Margaret got straight to the point. \u201cCan I see Daniel Chesterfield?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He looked at her as if she\u2019d requested an audience with the Pope. \u201cNo.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cIt\u2019s way past visiting hours,\u201d he said with more than a hint of sarcasm. \u201cIn case you ladies didn\u2019t realize it, this is a correctional facility. Otherwise known as a jail. Mr. Chesterfield has been indicted on a class one felony charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d Margaret didn\u2019t spare any pity for Danny Chesterfield. \u201cCould you give him something for me, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady, listen, I\u2019m sure you mean well but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I don\u2019t mean him well. I couldn\u2019t be happier that he\u2019s behind bars. I also know I can\u2019t allow my feelings toward this man to eat away at me any longer.\u201d She pulled a package from her large purse and literally shoved it at the corrections officer.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a prayer shawl,\u201d Margaret explained. \u201cI knit it myself. Give it to him and tell him...tell him,\u201d Margaret said in a choked voice, \u201ctell Mr. Chesterfield I\u2019m trying very hard to forgive him for what he did to my daughter. I\u2019m praying for him and I\u2019m praying for me because it isn\u2019t easy, you know?\u201d</p><p>So that was it. This was why Margaret had wanted to see Danny Chesterfield. To give him the prayer shawl. I blinked back tears, moved by how far my sister had come. Difficult as it was for her, she\u2019d taken Julia\u2019s words to heart.</p><p>I put my arm around her.</p><p>The correction officer\u2019s attitude changed instantly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know, do you?\u201d</p><p>Margaret wiped her eyes as if it were a crime to reveal emotion. She shook her head mutely.</p><p>\u201cDanny Chesterfield was in a car accident,\u201d he told us.</p><p>\u201cThat was reported in the paper,\u201d I answered for Margaret.</p><p>\u201cWhat wasn\u2019t reported is that he\u2019s paralyzed from the waist down.\u201d</p><p>Margaret froze and stared up at the officer.</p><p>\u201cHe suffered a spinal cord injury. He\u2019ll be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.\u201d</p><p>We left King County Jail soon afterward. Margaret seemed deep in thought as we walked to the parking lot and her car.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have wished that on him,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Until recently I would not have believed that. Now I did.</p><p>CHAPTER 39</p><p>Alix Townsend Turner</p><p>Grandma Turner\u2019s funeral was truly a beautiful event, Alix thought. She hadn\u2019t known what to expect. Like so much else in life, she\u2019d never experienced a real funeral. Even when her only brother died of an overdose, there\u2019d been no one but her to mourn his passing. No one to pay for his burial, either, so it had fallen to the government. Her brother had been cremated and his ashes placed in a common grave without a marker. All Alix ever knew was the name of the cemetery where Tom\u2019s ashes were kept.</p><p>Alix had assumed that at Sarah Turner\u2019s funeral there\u2019d be lots of sadness and tears. While that was true, and almost everyone wept, the mood was joyful, more like a celebration of a life well-lived, a woman well-loved.</p><p>Long before she died, Grandma Turner had made all her own burial arrangements, so the decisions hadn\u2019t been left to her children. She\u2019d given specific instructions on which songs to sing and what Scripture verses to read. The only thing she hadn\u2019t indicated was which clothes she wanted to be buried in and that was decided by her two daughters-in-law.</p><p>Alix and Jordan had arrived back from Canada in time for the viewing, the night before the services. This was an unfamiliar ritual for Alix. In her heart she knew Jordan\u2019s grandmother had been ready to die, ready for her heavenly reward. What she hadn\u2019t expected was the rush of emotion as she approached the casket, hand in hand with her husband. Large floral arrangements surrounded it and when Alix looked down on this woman she\u2019d come to love, she\u2019d had to blink back sudden tears. Jordan\u2019s family had chosen to bury their mother in a lovely blue dress. They\u2019d tucked Alix\u2019s prayer shawl around her shoulders.</p><p>Alix was moved by that.</p><p>Susan Turner came to stand next to her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Alix whispered, barely able to speak. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jordan\u2019s mother knew immediately why Alix was thanking her. \u201cSarah loved that shawl,\u201d her mother-in-law said in a low voice, \u201cbut more importantly she loved you. Just as I do.\u201d</p><p>At the gathering in the fellowship hall after the funeral, Alix took care of the serving and cleaning up, thus allowing family members to visit with their guests.</p><p>Susan found her in the church kitchen, washing dishes. \u201cThank you for all your help, Alix,\u201d she said.</p><p>Alix finished rinsing the last of the dishes and released the drain at the bottom of the sink. \u201cI was happy to do what I could.\u201d</p> <p>Susan sighed, leaning against the counter. \u201cMom always knew.\u201d</p><p>Alix turned and cast a quizzical glance at her mother-in-law as she dried her hands. \u201cKnew what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom knew you\u2019d be good for Jordan. I was the one with doubts, the one who questioned.... Well, you know that, but Alix, I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusan, please, it\u2019s okay.\u201d She wished Jordan\u2019s mother would forget all that. Alix had.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve forgiven me, which also amazes me about you.\u201d Susan seemed in awe of her, and that only embarrassed Alix further.</p> <p>\u201cListen,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m no saint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you need to remember,\u201d Alix told her, \u201cis that I realized if I was going to have a successful marriage, you and I had to come to a meeting of the minds. I didn\u2019t want to put my husband in the middle and demand that he choose sides. Besides, I don\u2019t have a mother of my own.\u201d Alix hesitated. \u201cWell, I do have a biological mother\u2014I\u2019m sure you remember her\u2014but she\u2019s no one I\u2019d ever want as a role model.\u201d</p><p>Susan nodded, then looked away. \u201cThe family would like to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor washing the dishes? No, really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for that,\u201d Susan said, interrupting her, \u201cbut for the way you handled everything the day of the wedding. You were the only one who thought of calling the sheriff\u2019s office, for instance.\u201d</p> <p>Alix shrugged off the praise. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve dealt with the police as much as I have, it\u2019s second nature to expect them in every situation.\u201d</p><p>Susan laughed, and then Jordan came into the kitchen. \u201cPeople are starting to leave, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d she said, hugged Alix and left.</p><p>Jordan was grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Alix wanted to know.</p><p>Jordan slid his arms around her waist. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty incredible, Alix Turner.\u201d He grinned again. \u201cPretty and incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m joking?\u201d</p> <p>She had to admit she enjoyed listening to him sing her praises, deserved or not.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you did to win over my mother, Alix, but she\u2019s had a complete turnaround.\u201d Jordan arched his brows. \u201cAre you going to tell me how you did it?\u201d</p><p>Wrapping her arms around him, Alix smiled. \u201cIt was easy. All I had to do was love her son.\u201d</p><p>Jordan kissed her then, and it wasn\u2019t the short, affectionate kisses they so often shared in public or when family members were nearby. Her husband kissed her the way he had on their wedding day, the kiss of a man utterly captivated by the woman he\u2019d married.</p><p>Alix leaned her head against Jordan\u2019s shoulder and looked out the kitchen door at the family gathered to honor the life of Sarah Turner. Many of them were people she barely knew, people she\u2019d met once or twice before. Some of their names escaped her at the moment, and yet they were her family now. Not Jordan\u2019s brother or his cousins and uncles and aunts. Their cousins, uncles and aunts.</p><p>For the first time in her adult life, Alix belonged.</p><p>CHAPTER 40</p><p>Colette Blake</p><p>Elizabeth Sasser invited Colette and Christian to dinner five days after his return from China. Since then, she and Christian had spent practically every minute together. He\u2019d accompanied Colette to her ultrasound appointment and then to her doctor\u2019s, where he listened to his child\u2019s heartbeat. Already he was enthralled with the idea of becoming a father.</p><p>Colette was no longer working. Susannah had been sympathetic\u2014and very excited for her. Chrissie, who was out of school now, would be filling in. Colette had offered to work out her two-week notice, but Susannah had said it wasn\u2019t necessary.</p><p>Elizabeth had invited Christian\u2019s father, Elliott, for dinner that same evening.</p><p>On Friday night, Elliott had arrived before Christian and Colette. The minute they pulled up outside the house, he stepped onto the porch to welcome them.</p><p>He smiled approvingly when Christian slipped his arm around Colette\u2019s waist and guided her up the walkway.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking considerably healthier,\u201d Elliott commented. \u201cAnd happier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Christian assured his father.</p><p>\u201cAre they here?\u201d Elizabeth asked, poking her head out the front door. She smiled when she saw them on the porch, then frowned at Christian and shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Elizabeth, I am not late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner\u2019s on the table,\u201d she said as though to prove him wrong.</p><p>The dining room had been set with a lace tablecloth, plus the china and silverware from the display cabinet. Doris had already carried in the serving dishes. In the center of the table was a sirloin roast, new red potatoes and fresh asparagus. The rolls appeared to be homemade.</p><p>\u201cThis looks delicious,\u201d Colette said as Christian drew out a chair for her.</p><p>He sat next to Colette and clasped her hand. It felt good to be linked to him, good and right.</p><p>After the blessing was given by Elliott, the serving dishes were passed around.</p><p>Elizabeth helped herself to a generous portion of roast beef, then set the plate down and glared at Christian. \u201cWell? Are you going to keep me in suspense all night?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cSuspense about what?\u201d Christian asked innocently. Beneath the table and out of view, he squeezed Colette\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to marry the girl or not?\u201d</p><p>Elliott seemed equally interested in his response.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about it.\u201d Christian glanced at Colette. \u201cIn other words, we\u2019re still negotiating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNegotiating,\u201d his aunt repeated scornfully. \u201cMarriage is a commitment, not a contract to be negotiated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s important, son,\u201d Elliott began, sounding far calmer than his aunt, \u201cis that you two love each other. And just seeing you together, I can tell that you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he loves her,\u201d Elizabeth said irritably. \u201cAnd she loves him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019ll reach the decision to marry in their own good time,\u201d Elliott assured the older woman.</p><p>Elizabeth picked up her fork. \u201cUnfortunately, time is of the essence,\u201d she muttered and dug into her beef.</p><p>\u201cNow, Elizabeth, be patient,\u201d Elliott cautioned. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be around for a lot of years yet.\u201d</p><p>Christian\u2019s great-aunt looked somewhat condescendingly at Elliott Dempsey. \u201cMy age has nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Christian said. \u201cAunt Betty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear,\u201d he said, struggling to hide a smile. He turned to his father. \u201cI do have some news for you.\u201d</p><p>Elliott smiled expectantly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to become a grandfather in three months.\u201d</p><p>Christian\u2019s father leaped to his feet, rushing over to congratulate them. But Elizabeth was not appeased. \u201cIf you don\u2019t marry this woman and give that baby your name, I swear to you right now, I\u2019m cutting you out of my will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Elizabeth,\u201d Christian said, grinning. \u201cThat baby\u2019s a little girl and her name is Elizabeth Catherine Dempsey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2014\u201d Elizabeth sputtered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re naming her after you,\u201d Colette said, \u201cand Christian\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married? For the love of heaven, please tell me you\u2019re getting married,\u201d Elizabeth cried. \u201cThe sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>Christian winked at Colette, but then his expression sobered. \u201cActually, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Elizabeth bellowed loudly enough to bring Doris running in from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d the housekeeper asked anxiously.</p><p>Stricken, Elizabeth nodded. \u201cEverything\u2019s delicious, Doris, thank you. You can bring out dessert in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s for dessert?\u201d Christian asked.</p><p>\u201cChristian, don\u2019t be cruel,\u201d Colette said and held up her left hand, revealing the gold band on her ring finger. \u201cChristian and I were married Thursday afternoon by my friend\u2019s husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope he\u2019s a minister,\u201d Elizabeth said under her breath.</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Colette told her. \u201cWe got the license first thing Monday morning and Jordan Turner married us as soon as the waiting period was over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we phoned my parents and told them our news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it?\u201d Elizabeth asked.</p><p>\u201cAll of it,\u201d Colette said. \u201cThey\u2019re pleased for us, more than a little surprised about the baby, but delighted.\u201d She paused. \u201cTelling Derek\u2019s parents was more difficult, but they wished us well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl named after me,\u201d Elizabeth repeated slowly, proudly. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you did something right,\u201d she said, reaching for her fork again. \u201cEven if you didn\u2019t invite me to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Elliott raised his wineglass to congratulate them. \u201cUnder the circumstances, Aunt Elizabeth, I think we can forgive the oversight.\u201d</p><p>Colette turned to smile at her husband, the man she loved, the man whose child she carried. They\u2019d decided to call her Beth, and when she brought her daughter home from the hospital, Colette would wrap her in the prayer shawl she\u2019d knit with Lydia and her other friends.</p><p>CHAPTER 41</p><p>\u201cGranny was knitting a lovely lacy sweater. She had a piece of paper with tick marks and numbers on it. \u2018Where is your pattern?\u2019 I asked. She replied, \u2018A pattern? God gave you a brain, didn\u2019t he?\u2019 Granny was a thinking knitter. I wanted to be just like her.\u201d</p><p>Ren\u00e9 Wells, Granny and Me Designs</p><p>Lydia Goetz</p><p>I was pleased that Julia and Hailey were with Mom when I visited. She chatted on endlessly about her childhood, and the girls listened attentively. It was a relief to see my mother in such high spirits. She was showing signs of improvement, I thought.</p><p>After about thirty minutes, the girls left and it was just Mom and me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking so happy,\u201d Mom said as I brushed her hair, getting her ready for an early dinner. The prayer shawl I\u2019d knit was tucked around her shoulders. She wore it almost constantly these days and I found that gratifying. Of all the things I\u2019d knit Mom through the years, this was the one I felt most strongly about because so many of those stitches held my hopes and prayers for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLydia?\u201d she asked as I stroked the brush down the length of her hair.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were those nice young girls?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, but it was a smile of sadness and resignation. \u201cThose are Margaret\u2019s daughters, Julia and Hailey.\u201d</p> <p>My mother sighed. \u201cOh, of course. What\u2019s the matter with me that I can\u2019t remember my own granddaughters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, don\u2019t worry. Julia and Hailey know who you are and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d The diagnosis was official now. Mom had Alzheimer\u2019s. As the disease progressed, I knew there\u2019d come a time when Mom no longer recognized me. I\u2019d deal with it; I would have no choice. I\u2019d remember her as the young wife in photographs from the \u201960s and \u201970s, as the mother who\u2019d walked me to school and sewed my Halloween costumes, as the grief-stricken widow and the old woman she was now. And all the moments in between. My mother.</p><p>\u201cIs Margaret coming?\u201d Mom asked in a tentative voice.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d My sister would come by sometime on Monday. We alternated visits, which helped. I was grateful for Margaret and the way taking care of Mom had strengthened the bond we shared as sisters.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be a star,\u201d Mom told me.</p> <p>I knew my mother was thinking about Margaret\u2019s high-school days and her athletic success. I was the brains of the family, supposedly. I did take pride in the fact that I\u2019d graduated with my high-school class despite missing almost my entire junior year while battling cancer.</p><p>After I finished brushing Mom\u2019s hair, it was time for dinner. Each of the residents was brought down to the dining room by a staff member. I waited until Mom was gone, then locked her room and left.</p><p>Brad, Cody and Chase were waiting for me at Green Lake. The three-mile walk around the lake was a favorite exercise of mine. Brad and Cody loved it, too, and Chase was quivering with excitement as he and Cody set off on their run.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your mom doing?\u201d Brad asked.</p><p>I thought about the question she\u2019d asked me\u2014who Julia and Hailey were\u2014and shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s in good spirits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p> <p>Brad knew I\u2019d agonized over the decision to move Mom yet again, and so soon after her last move. Until Margaret told me, I hadn\u2019t been aware how long she\u2019d been suffering from memory loss. But Dad had known and he\u2019d been covering for her and I\u2019d never suspected.</p><p>Brad and I started down the path, hands linked. He talked about one thing and another, and I responded at the appropriate times, but my mind was in a dozen different places.</p><p>I was thinking about Carol and her baby.</p><p>Colette, too.</p><p>It\u2019d been a shock when she told me she was pregnant. And married! Needless to say, she\u2019d moved out of the apartment and in with Christian. Which meant I\u2019d be looking for a new tenant soon, and that was fine. Susannah was going to miss her, but it seemed Chrissie enjoyed working in the flower shop, and she\u2019d be there all summer.</p><p>Mostly I\u2019ve been thinking about Brad and me adopting. Perhaps a baby would be unrealistic for us, but there are older children in need of a home, in need of love. That thought had come to me during a conversation with Alix. The state had declared her parents unfit and she\u2019d been eligible for adoption. Only she was too old, she\u2019d said, for anyone to want her. An older child\u2014this was a possibility Brad and I needed to explore.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very quiet,\u201d my husband said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking...about a lot of things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me one,\u201d he said.</p><p>I sorted through the most pressing of the thoughts dancing in my head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my mother won\u2019t live much longer,\u201d I said and felt an immediate sense of pain. It was the first time I\u2019d admitted this to Brad and the knowledge that I\u2019d soon be without my mother left me feeling bereft and alone.</p><p>\u201cThat frightens you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does, more than I realized it would,\u201d I told him, but found myself unable to describe my feelings beyond this awareness of impending loss. Life without Mom\u2014I could hardly imagine it. She was no longer the person she\u2019d been, and yet she would always be my mom.</p><p>\u201cThen treasure the time you still have with her,\u201d Brad suggested gently.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cMargaret phoned,\u201d he told me. \u201cShe wanted me to pass along the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny Chesterfield\u2019s been sentenced.\u201d</p><p>Margaret had followed the case closely; according to her, Danny had reached a plea agreement with the prosecuting attorney\u2019s office. He would be serving a ten-year prison term. To my way of thinking, he was already serving his sentence, and it had nothing to do with his time behind bars.</p><p>\u201cMom, Dad!\u201d Cody shouted frantically as Chase ran toward us, dragging his leash. \u201cCatch him for me.\u201d</p><p>Brad reached out and grabbed the dog\u2019s leash. Laughing, Cody caught up with us and hugged his father. \u201cThanks, Dad,\u201d he said, breathless with exhilaration and joy.</p><p>Joy.</p><p>I felt it, too, in every cancer-free cell of my body. I was at peace with my life and with the future, whatever it held. </p> </body></html>"]
