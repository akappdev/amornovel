The second time? Not so much.</p><p>After she cut five or six more, the blade in her left hand began to feel like an extension of her body, and she started to take it all in stride. The exhilaration subsided, and so did the nausea. There was no longer a rush of anxiety, no longer a racing heartbeat. Blood didn\u2019t faze her. The thrill was gone, and that, in her line of work, was a very good thing.</p><p>Dr. Eleanor Kathleen Sullivan, or Ellie as she was called by her family and friends, was just four days shy of completing a grueling surgical fellowship in one of the busiest trauma centers in the Midwest. Since trauma was her specialty, she had certainly seen her share of mangled and brutalized bodies. It was her responsibility to put them back together, and as a senior fellow, she had the added duty of training the first \u2013 and second-year residents.</p> <p>St. Vincent\u2019s emergency room had been full since 4:00 A.M. that morning, and Ellie was finishing what she hoped was her last surgery of the day, a repair of a splenic rupture. A teenager, barely old enough to have a driver\u2019s license, had decided to test the limits of the speedometer in his parents\u2019 Camry and had lost control, rolling the car over an embankment and landing upside down in an open field. Lucky for him, he had been wearing a seat belt, and luckier still, a man following some distance behind him had seen the whole thing and was able to call for an ambulance immediately. The boy made it to the emergency room just in time.</p><p>Ellie was observed by three second-year surgical residents, who hung on her every word. She was a natural teacher and, unlike 90 percent of the surgeons on staff at St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, didn\u2019t have much of an ego. She was amazingly patient with the medical students and residents. While she worked, she explained-and explained again-until they finally understood what she was doing and why. No question was deemed too insignificant or foolish, which was one of the many reasons they idolized her, and for the male residents, the fact that she was drop-dead gorgeous didn\u2019t hurt. Because she was such a talented surgeon and supportive teacher, all these fledgling doctors fought to sign up for her rotation. Ironically, what they didn\u2019t know was that she was younger than most of them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re off duty this weekend, aren\u2019t you, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>Ellie glanced over at Dr. Kevin Andrews, the anesthesiologist, who had asked the question. He had joined the staff six months before and, since the day he\u2019d met Ellie, had been hounding her to go out with him. He was an outrageous flirt and yet very sweet. Blond hair, blue eyes, tall and well built with an adorable smile, he could turn the head of almost every woman in the hospital, but for Ellie there just wasn\u2019t any spark.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. I have the whole weekend off,\u201d she answered. \u201cCharlie, would you like to close up for me?\u201d she asked one of the hovering residents.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely, Dr. Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better hurry,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cI\u2019m waking him up.\u201d</p><p>The resident looked panic-stricken.</p><p>\u201cTake your time, Charlie. He\u2019s just messing with you,\u201d she said, a smile in her voice.</p><p>\u201cTuesday\u2019s your last day at St. Vincent\u2019s, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Andrews asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Tuesday\u2019s my last official day. I might help out on a temporary basis later on, but I\u2019m not promising anything yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you could decide to come back permanently.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>He persisted. \u201cThey\u2019ll give you anything you want. You could name your price, your hours... you should stay here, Ellie. You belong here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t agree or disagree. In truth, she didn\u2019t know where she belonged. It had been such a hard road to get this far, she hadn\u2019t had time to think about the future. At least that was the excuse she used for her indecision.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she finally conceded. \u201cI just don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>She stood over Charlie, watching like a mother hen. \u201cI want those stitches tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dr. Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Monday night is my last chance to take you to heaven?\u201d Andrews asked in a teasing drawl.</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cHeaven? Last week you were going to rock my world. Now you\u2019re going to take me to heaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guarantee it. I\u2019ve got testimonials if you want to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, Kevin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>As she checked the last suture, she rolled her shoulders and stretched her neck to one side then the other to get the kinks out. She\u2019d been in the OR since 5:00 A.M., which meant she had been bent over patients for eleven hours. Sad to say, that wasn\u2019t a record for her.</p><p>She felt wrung out and stiff and sore. A good run around the park would get those muscles moving, she decided, maybe even rev up her energy.</p><p>\u201cYou know what would help you get rid of a stiff neck?\u201d Andrews said.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. A trip to heaven?\u201d</p><p>One of the nurses snorted with laughter. \u201cHe\u2019s awfully persistent, Dr. Sullivan. Maybe you should give in.\u201d</p><p>Ellie removed her gloves and dropped them in the trash bag by the OR doors. \u201cThanks, Megan, but I think I\u2019ll just go for a run instead.\u201d As she pushed the doors wide, she untied her surgical mask and pulled off her cap, shaking her blond hair loose to fall to her shoulders.</p><p>Twenty minutes later she was officially off duty. She changed into her workout clothes, a pair of faded red shorts and a white tank top. She double-tied her beat-up running shoes, grabbed a rubber band and swept her hair up in a ponytail, slipped her iPod into one pocket and her cell phone into the other, and she was ready. Walking a maze of corridors to get outside, she avoided the direct route through the ER for fear she\u2019d get waylaid with another case.</p><p>There was never a lack of patients rolling through the doors. Along with the usual emergencies-the car accidents, the heart attacks, the work injuries-the ER saw a steady stream of victims of violent crimes. The vast majority were young men. Gangs roamed the area east of the highway, and shooting one another seemed to be a nightly sport. Since St. Vincent\u2019s was the largest trauma center in St. Louis, all the serious cases came to them. Weekends were a nightmare for the staff. There were times, especially during the hot summer months, when gurneys lined the halls of the ER with patients handcuffed to the railings while they waited to go into surgery. Additional police had to be routinely called in to monitor them to make certain one gang member hadn\u2019t been placed too close to a rival.</p><p>Ellie became a member of the One Hundred Club when she removed her one hundredth bullet. It wasn\u2019t a club she wanted to join, but she would always remember the case. The young man was only twenty years old, and it was the third time he\u2019d been shot. She couldn\u2019t forget his insolence and his cold, empty eyes. They were almost as lifeless as the cadavers down in the morgue. Patching up these boys so that they could return to the streets and the same violence was heart wrenching, and she prayed, with every surgery, that this time they would learn something, that this time they would find a new life. It was a naive hope, but she clung to it anyway.</p><p>Like the other overworked and underpaid residents and fellows, Ellie operated on broken bodies, the consequence of violence. But she had never actually witnessed a crime... until today.</p><p>It was a hot and humid late afternoon. Two medical students had caught up with Ellie just as she began her run on the onemile track in Cambridge Park, a vast area that sat adjacent to the hospital. Heavy rain clouds hung over them, and all three panted for air. After the first mile, both students dropped out, but Ellie was determined to get in at least one more mile before calling it quits. She made mental lists as she ran. She had a million things to do before heading home to Winston Falls.</p><p>Dear God, it was muggy. The humidity was so thick, she felt as though she were running through a sauna. Sweat trickled down the back of her neck, and her drenched clothes clung to her body. Her friend Jennifer, a nurse in pediatrics, who was taking a shortcut across the track to get to the ER entrance, shouted to Ellie that she was crazy to run in this heat. Ellie waved and continued on. She probably was crazy, but getting any time to work out was such a luxury, she couldn\u2019t afford to be choosy about the weather.</p><p>Ellie could hear faint cheering coming from the new soccer field across the street to the north, and as she rounded the curve, she saw the players-high school \u2013 age girls-sprinting across the field. From the large number of fans in the bleachers, she guessed it was an important game.</p><p>The administrator of the hospital, the board, and a plethora of attorneys had fought the soccer field. They wanted to purchase the land to build another huge parking garage, and Ellie was happy they had lost their bid. Like the track and small playground to the south, the soccer field was far enough away from the hospital that, no matter how much noise the teams and fans made, the patients weren\u2019t disturbed.</p><p>Ellie was a football, basketball, and soccer fan, in that order. She loved to watch most sporting events. She admired the grace, skill, and finesse of the players, probably because she didn\u2019t possess any of those attributes herself. She had been such an awkward child, her mother had enrolled her in ballet classes, and she never got to play a sport. When she wasn\u2019t tripping over her own feet trying to do a pli\u00e9, she was reading. She was much more comfortable with her books. Her aunt Vivien liked to call her a bookworm.</p><p>No time to watch any games today, she thought. She had way too much to do. She returned to her mental list of things to be accomplished before she could head home to her sister\u2019s wedding. Oh God, how she dreaded that. She wished she had another week to get ready for the ordeal; then admitted to herself that no amount of time would prepare her for the whispers and the sympathetic smiles from her friends and family. Who could blame them? After all, her sister Ava was marrying Ellie\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9. It was going to be a week of mortification, she decided. But, hey, she was tough. She could handle it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>And then there was Evan Patterson. Just thinking about him made her stomach hurt. Would he dare show up in Winston Falls? God, she hoped not. But if he did, would she need to get another restraining order, even if she was going to be home for only a few days? She could feel herself getting worked up and had to force herself to calm down. She was an adult now, and she could handle anything that came her way. Even a maniac, she told herself. Besides, she was sure Evan wasn\u2019t back in Winston Falls. If he had returned, her father would have alerted her.</p><p>Ellie didn\u2019t want to worry about Patterson now or think about the wedding. Instead, she chose to focus on the task at hand. Just a little more than a half mile to go, then a lovely cold shower. She took her earphones from her pocket and was about to turn on her iPod to listen to a lecture on new thoracotomy procedures when she heard a loud pop.</p><p>Ellie stopped running. Lightning? She looked up at the ominous sky just as another pop echoed, then a third and a fourth in rapid succession. Had lightning hit a transformer? That would explain the bursts... except there hadn\u2019t been any lightning.</p><p>Gunshots? Had to be. As many bullets as Ellie had removed from gunshot victims, she\u2019d never actually heard the sound of a gun firing. The noise came from somewhere up ahead. She glanced to the right toward the soccer field. No panic there. The game was still going on, so she had to be wrong. If not gunshots... then what?</p><p>Five or six seconds had passed since the first popping sound. Ellie reached for her earphones again. Okay, she\u2019d been mistaken.</p><p>Then the screaming started.</p><p>Everything happened so fast. In the span of just a few more seconds, Ellie observed the chaotic scene unfold in front of her as though it were happening in slow motion.</p><p>In the distance, several men, wearing navy blue T-shirts and vests with FBI in bold yellow letters printed on the back, appeared almost out of nowhere and fanned out as they raced toward the trees in the center of the park. People were scattering every which way. Screams mingled with the cheers from the soccer field, the fans and players apparently oblivious to what was happening. A father ran from the playground toward the street with two little boys. The children weren\u2019t able to keep up, so the father scooped them into his arms and kept running. Several people who had been strolling through the park also scrambled to get away, as did three boys who had been tossing a Frisbee. One of the boys ran into the street, directly in front of an ambulance returning to the hospital. The vehicle came to a screeching halt, and the boy rushed around to the open window shouting something to the paramedic as he pointed toward the trees.</p><p>Suddenly, a man and a woman, linked arm in arm, drew her attention. They walked briskly toward her on the running path. There was something off about both of them. The man had a thick mustache. He wore dark glasses, a baseball cap pulled down over his forehead, and a brown, hooded windbreaker zipped up to his neck, a peculiar choice in the 90-degree weather. Was he all bundled up to keep his clothes dry when the storm broke? The man looked over his shoulder, his neck glistening with sweat. The woman looked directly at Ellie. Her bizarre appearance was startling. A short black wig sat slightly askew on her head with a few long hairs hanging down the side of her neck. Her eyes were such an intense, unnatural shade of green, she looked as though she were wearing novelty contacts, the ones you\u2019d buy for a Halloween party. When the couple was about thirty feet away from Ellie, they veered toward the street.</p><p>Someone shouted a command. Then one of the FBI agents who had run into the trees appeared and headed straight for the pair. The woman let go of the man and began to run as he slowed and pulled something from his coat pocket. When he whirled around to face the agent shouting at him, Ellie saw the gun. Before she could react, he\u2019d fired two shots. The first bullet struck the man in pursuit, the force so great it knocked him back before he crashed to the ground. The second bullet went wild. As Ellie dived to the grass, the shooter spun around and pointed the gun toward her. He didn\u2019t pull the trigger but instead ran to the street and jumped into a car that sped away.</p><p>The ambulance had just turned around to go in the direction the boys were pointing, but when the gunshots were fired, it changed course. Sirens on, the ambulance crossed over the curb and swerved to miss the hospital emergency entrance sign. It bounded across the park toward the gunshot victim, weaving in and out of the crowd that was scrambling toward the boulevard.</p><p>Ellie jumped to her feet and ran after it. Her mind was racing. Who were the surgeons on call tonight? Edmonds and Walmer, she remembered, and she\u2019d seen both of them in the hospital. Good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The target had been a good distance away from the shooter, but he\u2019d taken a direct hit to the torso. Ellie had no idea how bad the wound was, but she thought, if she could stabilize him, he\u2019d make it to the OR.</p><p>The ambulance crossed the grassy area of the park in no time and stopped a few feet away from the downed man. Two paramedics leapt to the ground. Ellie recognized them: Mary Lynn Scott and Russell Probst. Russell opened the back doors and pulled out the gurney while Mary Lynn reached for the large orange trauma bag and rushed forward, sliding to her knees beside the victim. By the time Ellie reached the scene, four armed agents had surrounded him. One knelt on the ground talking to the man, trying to keep him calm, while three others stood over him.</p><p>The tallest of the three agents who were standing blocked her view. He barely glanced at her as he brusquely ordered, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to see this. Go back to your soccer game.\u201d</p><p>Go back to your game? Was he serious? Ellie was about to protest when one of the paramedics looked up, spotted her, and shouted, \u201cOh thank God. Dr. Sullivan.\u201d</p> <p>The agents looked at her skeptically and then slowly moved out of her way so that she could get past. Mary Lynn tossed her a pair of gloves, and Ellie pulled them on as she knelt down beside the man to assess the injury. Blood saturated the man\u2019s shirt. She gently lifted the compress Mary Lynn had pressed to his shoulder, saw the damage, and immediately sought to stem the bleeding. While she gave orders to Russell and Mary Lynn, she kept her voice steady. The patient was conscious, and she didn\u2019t want him to panic.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She made it a point never to lie to a patient. That didn\u2019t mean she had to be brutally honest, however. \u201cIt\u2019s bad, but I\u2019ve seen worse, much worse.\u201d</p><p>Russell handed her a clamp, and she found the source of the bleeding. The bullet hadn\u2019t gone through but had made quite an entrance.</p><p>Once Mary Lynn had gotten the IV line in, Ellie nodded to her to begin the drip.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked as she began packing the wound.</p><p>\u201cSean... Sean... ah, hell, I can\u2019t remember my last name.\u201d His eyelids began to flutter as he struggled to stay conscious.</p><p>The agent kneeling beside him said, \u201cGoodman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d Sean said, his voice growing weaker.</p><p>\u201cCan you remember if you\u2019re allergic to anything?\u201d Mary Lynn asked.</p><p>\u201cJust bullets.\u201d Sean stared at Ellie through half-closed eyes. \u201cAre you a doctor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, flashing a reassuring smile. She finished packing the wound and leaned back on her heels.</p><p>\u201cDr. Sullivan\u2019s a trauma surgeon,\u201d Russell explained. \u201cIf you had to get shot, she\u2019s the one you want operating on you. She\u2019s the best there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, he\u2019s stable. You can take him,\u201d Ellie said as she peeled off her gloves and dropped them in the plastic container Mary Lynn opened for her.</p><p>Sean suddenly grabbed her arm, his grip surprisingly strong. \u201cWait...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to marry Sara. Am I going to see her again?\u201d</p><p>She leaned over him. \u201cYes, you will,\u201d she said. \u201cBut first you\u2019re going into the OR to get that bullet out. Now sleep. It\u2019s all good. The surgeon will take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s on tonight?\u201d Russell asked.</p> <p>\u201cEdmonds and Walmer,\u201d Mary Lynn answered.</p><p>Sean tightened his hold on Ellie\u2019s arm. \u201cI want you.\u201d He didn\u2019t give her time to respond but held tight and forced himself to stay awake as he repeated, \u201cHe said you\u2019re the best. I want you to operate.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on top of his and nodded. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>She stood and stepped back to get out of the way so that the paramedics could put Sean into the ambulance but was stopped by something solid. It felt as though she\u2019d just backed into a slab of granite. The agent who had told her to go back to her soccer game was blocking her exit with his warm, hard chest. He put his hands on her shoulders to steady her, then let go. When he still didn\u2019t get out of her way, she stood her ground pressed against him.</p><p>\u201cDr. Sullivan, do you want to ride with us?\u201d Russell called out.</p><p>\u201cNo, go ahead. He\u2019s stable now.\u201d</p><p>Russell swung the doors shut, jumped into the driver\u2019s seat, and the ambulance was on its way.</p><p>Ellie turned to the agent who had been kneeling with Sean. \u201cWas anyone else hurt?\u201d</p><p>The granite wall behind her answered. \u201cNot hurt, dead.\u201d He was very matter-of-fact.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t ours,\u201d another agent explained. \u201cThey were wanted men.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and came face to shoulders with the most intimidating man she\u2019d ever seen, and that was saying something considering the monster chief of surgery she worked under. This man didn\u2019t look anything like him, though. The agent was tall, dark, and scary, with thick black hair and penetrating, steely gray eyes. His firm, square jaw was covered with at least one day\u2019s growth of beard, maybe two. He looked as though he hadn\u2019t slept in at least twenty-four hours, a look she knew all too well.</p><p>Ellie\u2019s heart skipped a beat. The man could scare the quills off a porcupine. But, oh God, was he sexy! Ellie gave herself a mental slap. An intimidating man who was built like a monument and could melt iron with his menacing glare-this was what she was attracted to?</p><p>The agent who had been kneeling stepped forward and put out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Agent Tom Bradley. Sean Goodman\u2019s my partner.\u201d He introduced her to the two agents on his left and then to the man in front of her. \u201cAgent Max Daniels.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to get to the OR.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for permission, but turned and ran back to the hospital.</p><p>Thirty minutes later she was dropping the bullet she\u2019d retrieved from Sean\u2019s shoulder into a small metal pan. \u201cBag it and get it to one of the agents waiting outside. You know the drill.\u201d</p><p>Then the real work of repairing the damage began. Ellie had learned over the years that there was no such thing as a simple bullet wound. Bullets had a way of doing considerable damage before settling, but Agent Goodman was lucky. His bullet hadn\u2019t penetrated any major organs or nerves.</p><p>Once she\u2019d closed, she followed the patient to recovery, wrote orders, and went to talk to the crowd gathered in the surgical waiting room. A dozen people with worried faces sat waiting for the news. Agent Daniels was standing, leaning against the wall with his arms across his chest. His gaze followed her as she entered the room, and her heart began to race. She knew she looked a mess. She pulled off her cap and threaded her fingers through her hair. Why in heaven\u2019s name she wanted to look good for him was beyond her comprehension, and yet she did.</p><p>\u201cThe surgeon\u2019s here,\u201d Daniels announced.</p><p>A petite young woman jumped up and rushed forward, followed by Agent Bradley and a crowd of worried relatives.</p><p>\u201cThe surgery went well,\u201d she began and then explained some of what she had repaired, trying not to be too technical. \u201cI expect him to make a full recovery.\u201d</p><p>Sara, his fianc\u00e9e, was crying as she stammered her thank-you. She shook Ellie\u2019s hand and held on to it.</p><p>\u201cYou can see him in about an hour,\u201d Ellie told her. \u201cHe\u2019s heavily sedated and he\u2019s not going to know you\u2019re there,\u201d she warned. \u201cHe\u2019ll be in recovery for a while, then they\u2019ll take him to ICU. Once the nurses in ICU have him settled, they\u2019ll send someone to get you. Any questions?\u201d</p><p>A frazzled-looking nurse appeared in the doorway. \u201cDr. Sullivan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind looking at Mrs. Klein for us? She\u2019s Edmonds\u2019s patient, but he\u2019s in surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>She patted Sara\u2019s hand and pulled free. \u201cAll right then. It\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Agent Daniels smile as she turned to leave. She walked down the corridor and had just turned the corner when he caught up with her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Doctor.\u201d</p><p>She turned around. Her stupid heart went into overdrive again. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need to talk to you about the shooting. You\u2019ll have to give a statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about after you check on that patient?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cGee, I don\u2019t know. I hate to miss soccer practice.\u201d</p><p>She was laughing as she pushed the doors aside and disappeared into ICU.</p><p>Max Daniels stood there staring after her, a slight grin crossing his face.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>TWO</p><p>Agent Daniels waited for her in the hallway just outside the ICU doors. He was leaning with his back to the wall, one ankle crossed over the other, looking half asleep and thoroughly relaxed.</p><p>Ellie was impressed. It had taken her years of sleep deprivation to perfect the art of falling asleep on her feet. Never during surgery, of course-that was definitely frowned upon-but in between emergencies when she knew she had only a couple of minutes before she was paged again. Five minutes here, ten minutes there-it seemed to be enough to keep her refreshed and alert. She still didn\u2019t know how to relax, though, no matter how hard she tried. Daniels made it look easy.</p><p>Ellie was pleased she hadn\u2019t kept him waiting long. All she\u2019d had to do for Mrs. Klein was adjust her medications. Mr. Klein was the real concern. Ellie had to once again order him to keep his hands off his wife\u2019s tubes and IVs and to stop trying to wake her up. The stubborn man couldn\u2019t quite grasp the notion of a medically induced coma, but he did understand that he would be banned from the ICU if he didn\u2019t behave himself. Janet Newman, the head nurse, was convinced Mr. Klein was attempting to kill his wife and blame it on the hospital. Janet pointed out that Mrs. Klein was twenty-nine years older than her husband, way too old to be considered a cougar, and she was also extremely wealthy. It was obvious to the nurse that the sneaky bastard-Janet\u2019s name for Mr. Klein-had married the poor woman for her fortune only.</p><p>Although Ellie didn\u2019t believe Mr. Klein wanted to harm his wife, she gave Janet new instructions: If there was another incident with the tubes, she was to call security and have Mr. Klein removed from the floor.</p><p>Dealing with the families took compassion, patience, and understanding; and on days like today, after working such a long shift, Ellie ran low on all three. It had been a grueling week with double shifts and very little sleep. She wondered if she looked as tired as she felt. The interview with the agent shouldn\u2019t take long, she thought, and then she could go home, take a hot shower, and fall into bed. That lovely thought made her sigh. Earlier, she had grabbed a few minutes to take a quick shower in the doctors\u2019 quarters, but it wasn\u2019t at all the same as showering in her own bathroom with her own apricot-scented shampoo, her body lotions, and her soft towels. She couldn\u2019t wait to get home.</p><p>Ellie should have known she wouldn\u2019t get out of the hospital that easily.</p><p>As she walked toward the agent, she said, \u201cThat didn\u2019t take any time at all, did it, Agent Daniels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t take long,\u201d he agreed. \u201cCall me Max,\u201d he added.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAnd you may call me Ellie.\u201d</p><p>She had almost reached him when the ancient intercom crackled to life. \u201cDr. Blue to ICU. Dr. Blue to ICU.\u201d The summons was the not-too-subtle code for a patient crashing, a code blue. Everyone in the hospital knew what it meant, including every patient over the age of ten, but the administrator refused to give the code a different name.</p><p>Ellie stopped abruptly, took a deep breath, then turned to go back into the ICU.</p><p>She called over her shoulder, \u201cAgent Daniels... I mean, Max... if you want, you could leave your number with reception, and I\u2019ll get hold of you just as soon as I\u2019m finished here.\u201d</p><p>If he replied, she didn\u2019t hear him because the doors were closing behind her as she ran to the patient in trouble.</p><p>This time she was gone a little longer, but not much, just fifteen minutes, and when she once again stepped out into the hallway, she was surprised to see that Max was still there waiting for her. He was talking on his cell phone, but the second he spotted her, he ended the call and headed toward her.</p><p>It suddenly occurred to Ellie that the agent might be worried that his friend had been the patient who coded, and she hurried to reassure him.</p><p>\u201cThe code wasn\u2019t for Agent Goodman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I asked one of the nurses to go in and find out.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI just checked on him. He\u2019s resting comfortably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe code?\u201d he asked, curious. \u201cHow did that turn out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe patient\u2019s back with us, so it\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and Ellie felt a flutter in her chest. How could anyone that tough looking have such a devastating smile? He was an imposing figure, tall and broad shouldered, with huge biceps and a wide chest that appeared to be all muscle. His jaw was hidden beneath a scruffy beard, but the slight dimple creasing his cheek was still noticeable. His thick hair needed a trim, and he looked as though he\u2019d been to battle and back. There really wasn\u2019t anything \u201cpretty boy\u201d about him, nothing remotely gorgeous like Dr. Andrews; yet, cleaned up, this man had the potential to be a real heartthrob. But not for her. Been there. Almost done that.</p><p>Ellie forced herself to concentrate on the reason he was here, the shooting. She needed to explain that, if he wanted to question her, they would have to find someplace outside the hospital. As long as she was on the premises, the nurses and doctors would continue to page her. And the two older surgeons on call tonight would be happy to let her do their job while they watched ESPN in the doctors\u2019 lounge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d she began. \u201cOtherwise, the interruptions... oh no.\u201d She groaned the last words. \u201cGreat,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJust great.\u201d</p><p>Max turned to see a tall, round-shouldered man with a giant forehead and very little hair come barreling toward Ellie with a glare plastered on his face.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d he asked quietly. He could have sworn he heard her whisper, \u201cA dinosaur.\u201d</p><p>The man marching toward them was a doctor, an uptight one at that. He wore an immaculate white coat with a stethoscope dangling from one of the pockets. Pale blue, long-sleeved shirt, bold striped tie, black pants with perfect creases, and tasseled loafers that looked new-he was impeccably dressed. Max wondered if the man\u2019s personality was as starched as his appearance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dr. Brent Westfield was the chief of surgery at St. Vincent\u2019s. He had just rounded the corner. Spotting Ellie, he barked, \u201cWhat are you doing here, Prod? Aren\u2019t you off this weekend? Of course you are. Do I have to remind you that, as of two weeks ago, we are all following new guidelines? No exceptions. You know that.\u201d He glanced at his Gucci sports watch and added, \u201cYou should have signed out two hours ago.\u201d</p><p>New guidelines. Right. Exasperated, Ellie simply nodded. It was true. According to the new hospital policy, residents and fellows could be on duty only a certain number of hours in a twenty-four-hour day; but there was a big loophole, one little phrase in the guidelines that made them useless: unless there was an emergency. And funny thing, there was always an emergency. Ellie was certain the contingency was just a clever way for the hospital to appear to be following the guidelines while working the residents until they were dead on their feet. In reality, the new guidelines weren\u2019t that different from the old ones, and Westfield knew it. He was just in the mood to hassle her, she decided, probably because he was irritated that she hadn\u2019t signed a contract to stay with the hospital... at least not yet. She was still contemplating where she wanted to live and what she wanted to do-trauma center or general surgery. And she also had to take into account Evan Patterson. Where was he hiding? How could she make a decision without knowing where he was? Ellie was so tired now, nothing sounded good to her, but she knew she would have to make her decision soon because, even with all the scholarships and grants she had received, she owed a little over two hundred thousand.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get in trouble with the board?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Was he kidding? The board of directors loved him. It was such a bogus question, she didn\u2019t bother to answer.</p> <p>Westfield abruptly turned to Max. \u201cAnd who is this?\u201d</p><p>Ellie knew he had noticed the FBI badge hooked to the left side of Max\u2019s belt and the gun holstered on the opposite side, but she didn\u2019t comment on it or mention that Max\u2019s navy blue T-shirt had big yellow FBI letters conspicuously printed across the back. Instead, she quickly made the introductions, and the two men shook hands. The chief had always been a commanding figure to Ellie because of his position of power, his aggressive tactics, and most important, his skill in the operating room, but standing next to the FBI agent who towered over him, Westfield suddenly didn\u2019t seem so intimidating. Max was more imposing. The agent radiated strength and confidence. She strongly doubted he was as contentious as the chief, though.</p><p>\u201cI heard there was a shooting outside the hospital doors. Is that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it happened close to the hospital,\u201d Max answered.</p><p>Westfield waited for the agent to expound and was sorely disappointed. Usually, the chief\u2019s intense frown, pursed lips, and unnerving silence was enough to make the people he was interrogating so uneasy they would blurt out all sorts of information. His tactics weren\u2019t working on Max.</p> <p>\u201cThree men were killed?\u201d he prodded.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Another ten seconds passed in silence. Then the chief asked, \u201cAn FBI agent was shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was trying not to smile. Westfield had to be frustrated. By using his stern tone and his most serious scowl, he was doing his best to push the agent into giving an explanation, but it wasn\u2019t working. Apparently, Max couldn\u2019t be intimidated.</p><p>The chief abruptly turned to Ellie. \u201cWho did the surgery on the agent?\u201d And before she could answer, he added, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been you because you\u2019re off duty, aren\u2019t you? And you aren\u2019t on call this weekend. So who did the surgery? Was it Walmer?\u201d</p> <p>Westfield knew she had operated on the agent. The man knew everything that went on inside the hospital. He was just trying to exert his power and make her squirm. Four more days under his thumb, she reminded herself, just four more days and she was free. She needed to suck it up until then.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, Dr. Walmer didn\u2019t do the surgery.\u201d Taking Max\u2019s lead, she didn\u2019t say another word.</p><p>\u201cEdmonds?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who operated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>The glare was back in place. \u201cEven though you were off duty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, even though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me attitude, Sullivan,\u201d he said, pointing a finger at her.</p><p>Max kept expecting Ellie to tell Westfield that Agent Goodman had pleaded with her to do the surgery, but she didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t offer any excuses. She simply stared Westfield in the eyes and waited.</p><p>\u201cHelp me understand,\u201d he began in his best sarcastic voice. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you notify Walmer or Edmonds to hightail it to the OR?\u201d And once again he didn\u2019t give her time to answer the question before posing another. \u201cDo you think you\u2019re a better surgeon than they are?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYes, sir, I do. Absolutely.\u201d</p><p>Max could tell Westfield was pleased with her answer but trying not to let her know it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re arrogant.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was about to say, \u201cThank you,\u201d but caught herself in time. \u201cYes, sir, I am.\u201d</p><p>And it was true. When it came to her work, she was arrogant, just like all the other surgeons in the hospital. It came with the territory and, in Ellie\u2019s opinion, was a necessary requirement. When a surgeon held a scalpel in her hand and was about to cut open a patient, she had better have skill and almost superhuman confidence. Ellie honestly didn\u2019t think there was such a thing as a timid surgeon, and if there was, she certainly wouldn\u2019t want him cutting on her.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of her self-assuredness and arrogance spilled over into her personal life. During her last trip home, she had been told by her sister Ava that she was depressingly insecure. But, since Ava was the sister who was marrying Ellie\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, she wasn\u2019t inclined to listen to anything she had to say. Ava\u2019s twin, Annie, was living in San Diego and hadn\u2019t had a chance to weigh in on Ellie\u2019s faults. She would side with Ava, of course, but she would be much kinder about it. Despite her sisters\u2019 persistence, Ellie would disagree with both of them. She wasn\u2019t depressingly insecure. Just mildly so.</p><p>Ellie suddenly realized she was zoning out. Now wasn\u2019t the time to think about personal problems. She\u2019d have plenty of time for that once she was home. Focus, she told herself. Westfield was chatting with Max again, probably telling him how to do his job. She took a deep breath in an attempt to get more oxygen to her befuddled brain.</p><p>Westfield turned back to her, his index finger just inches from her face. \u201cYou. Get out of here. Now.\u201d He didn\u2019t snarl the order, but he came close.</p><p>Ellie watched him as he strode toward ICU. He shoved the doors out of his way, looked over his shoulder, and snapped, \u201cAnd sign the contract.\u201d</p><p>The doors automatically closed behind him. She sighed and, in a faint Southern accent, said, \u201cIsn\u2019t he sweet? We all just love him to pieces.\u201d</p><p>Max laughed. \u201cHow long have you been taking orders from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does he call you Prod?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHe likes to.\u201d</p><p>She started walking down the long hallway with Max at her side.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d he asked.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t immediately answer, he glanced down at her and saw her cheeks were flushed. She was embarrassed, and that only piqued his interest all the more. He let the question go for now. \u201cDid I hear you call him a dinosaur? When I asked you who he was...\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t see the resemblance? Actually, I usually call him \u2018T. rex.\u2019 I think it\u2019s more personal. When he\u2019s on a roar-which is ninety percent of the time-he does remind me of a gigantic, prehistoric beast.\u201d</p><p>She was moving at a fast clip.</p><p>\u201cEllie, hold up. Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpstairs to get my keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to sit down and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She kept right on going. Max was becoming frustrated. \u201cDo you run everywhere you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d she admitted. She slowed to a normal pace... normal for her, anyway. She noticed that Max had no trouble keeping up with her. In fact, with his long legs, he barely had to increase his stride beyond a stroll.</p><p>She glanced over at him. He was definitely out of her comfort zone. The man had so much testosterone, he made her nervous. He didn\u2019t scare her, though. When he smiled, the corners of his eyes creased, and there was a glint in them that made her shiver inside.</p><p>Jeez, get a grip, Sullivan. She was acting like a sex-starved teenager. Granted, it had been a long time since she had been with a man-a long, long time-but, still, her reaction to Max went beyond bizarre. It was completely contrary to her usual calm, rational nature. When she had time, she would figure out her weird behavior. There had to be some logical explanation. But then, maybe she didn\u2019t really have to worry about it at all because, as soon as Max questioned her about the shooting, he\u2019d be on his way, and she would be sane again.</p><p>Max noticed that she kept looking at him with a puzzled expression on her face. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNothing important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be much help with descriptions I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe have to take your statement anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother agent, Ben MacBride, and I are working this together, and we have to question you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the crime scene,\u201d he answered. Where I should be, he silently added.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you start asking your questions while you walk with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t work that way. I\u2019m going to record what you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then we need to find someplace quiet, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Ellie passed a bank of elevators and continued on to the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll grab my things, and we can get out of here. I stand a better chance of actually leaving if you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a gun.\u201d</p><p>Max kept pace as she ran up three flights. \u201cYou have a thing against elevators? A phobia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the only exercise I get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were running the track when the shooting started, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you figure that out?\u201d she asked, taking the steps a little slower while she waited for his answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an FBI agent, trained to be observant,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. You thought I was one of the kids on that high school soccer team.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYeah, I did,\u201d he admitted. \u201cOne of the other agents told me you were running the track.\u201d</p><p>He could laugh at himself. What an appealing trait, she thought. She liked that quality in a man... Seriously! What was happening to her? She really needed to get away from him as soon as possible.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question. Is it a phobia or just a quirk?\u201d he wondered.</p><p>\u201cI do the stairs and I run the track and I don\u2019t particularly like being crammed inside a little metal box with a bunch of other people.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cSo that\u2019s a yes. You do have a phobia.\u201d</p><p>Probably, she thought, but she wasn\u2019t going to admit it. She did ride in elevators with patients when she had to. She didn\u2019t like it, but she did it anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you keep your things? On the roof?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust here.\u201d Ellie entered the hallway on the fourth floor and opened the door to a dark room filled with lockers. She switched on a light and walked to the third one on the left. Had she been alone, she would have locked the door and changed into jeans and a T-shirt, but she wasn\u2019t alone, so she was going to have to stay in her scrubs. She didn\u2019t like wearing them outside the hospital, but she didn\u2019t have a choice now. She pulled out her backpack, put some of her clothes inside, grabbed her keys from the top shelf, and was ready to leave.</p><p>She followed him to the stairwell, appreciating the fact that he wasn\u2019t pushing the issue with the elevators. When his cell phone rang, he stopped on a landing to answer, and she stopped to wait for him.</p><p>Max\u2019s partner, Ben MacBride, was on the line and wanted help with a couple of uncooperative witnesses.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, I\u2019ll be there in five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Ben said. \u201cAgent Hughes wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>While Max was waiting for Ben to get Hughes, he turned to Ellie. She stood on the step above him, and her eyes were level with his. He found it impossible not to stare at her. The woman was breathtaking. Her eyes were the most intense shade of blue. Her nose was dotted with freckles, which he found damn alluring, and her mouth... ah, man, he really needed to stop staring. He was already conjuring up all sorts of fantasies involving her full, luscious lips, and he was going to be in real trouble if he let his eyes wander lower.</p><p>Max didn\u2019t wait for Hughes to get on the line. He abruptly ended the call, turned, and continued down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going to do this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He smiled. Now, that was a leading question, considering where his thoughts had been.</p><p>\u201cGo home.\u201d His voice was brisk.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, glancing back at her. \u201cYou can go home, and we\u2019ll come to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she said. \u201cI can get out of these scrubs. Let me give you my address...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCell phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a witness. I had all your information downloaded to my phone while I was waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou Googled me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><p>Ellie wondered what she would find if she Googled him. Under \u201coccupation\u201d would it say he was an FBI agent and give her the number of criminals he\u2019d apprehended... and shot? No, of course not. His profile probably wouldn\u2019t tell her whether he was involved with anyone or whether he was married, either. She had taken the time to notice that he wasn\u2019t wearing a wedding band, and something told her that, if he was married, he would always wear it.</p><p>Now, why would she make that assumption? She wasn\u2019t clairvoyant, and the truth was, she didn\u2019t know anything about him other than he carried a badge, could be quite intimidating at times, and had a great smile. Was she making him admirable because she wanted him to be? From what she knew about the FBI-which was precious little-outsiders weren\u2019t privy to personal information, but she might Google him anyway just to appease her curiosity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Okay, she really needed a life outside of the OR. Then maybe she wouldn\u2019t have such a strong reaction to a man she barely knew.</p><p>They reached the main floor on the south side of the hospital. Ellie\u2019s ancient SUV was parked in the doctors\u2019 lot adjacent to the hospital. Max opened the exit door for her. She brushed against him as she walked outside and got a hint of his masculine scent and just a trace of aftershave. For a man who looked as though he hadn\u2019t picked up a razor in quite some time, he smelled really good.</p><p>She knew what she smelled like. Disinfectant. Unfortunately, that had been her perfume for the past several years. It could be worse, she thought. The pathology residents smelled like formaldehyde, even when they were off duty. The odor seemed to permeate their skin.</p><p>Max walked her to her car. It was a gentlemanly thing to do, but not at all necessary since it was light outside and there were police cars all over the campus. The crime scene team was still there, combing the park for additional evidence. Ellie didn\u2019t believe she could be any safer.</p> <p>\u201cDo you walk out here in the middle of the night?\u201d Max asked as he looked around.</p><p>\u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI count only six lights, and this is a big parking lot with countless places to hide. Not good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m leaving during the night, a guard walks me to my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when you get called to come in?\u201d</p> <p>I park my car, then run like lightning to the doors with pepper spray in my hand, she thought but didn\u2019t say.</p><p>\u201cI try to park as close to the hospital doors as possible, and I\u2019m vigilant,\u201d she stated with a nod.</p><p>\u201cVigilant, huh?\u201d</p><p>His smile could stop traffic. She couldn\u2019t tell if he was teasing her or laughing at her.</p><p>Max opened her car door. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later. It will probably be a couple of hours before we get to your place. Don\u2019t go anywhere. Stay home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until she had driven out of the lot and was on her way home that she glanced in the mirror. No makeup, hair a mess, and wearing scrubs that were two sizes too big for her-lovely. No wonder Max had escorted her to her car. He probably felt sorry for her. He wouldn\u2019t have given her a second glance under normal circumstances.</p><p>Oh well, what did it matter? After a brief interview, he would be history, and after next Tuesday, hopefully, she would be, too.</p><p>THREE</p><p>The Landrys had escaped once again, but Max knew it was only a matter of time before the notorious couple would run out of luck. Since Dr. Ellie Sullivan was a potential witness to the shooting, it was his job to find out all he could about her before he added her to the witness list for the federal prosecutor.</p><p>He tried to be objective but found it impossible, for the more he learned about her, the less inclined he was to let anyone know she had witnessed anything, which was ludicrous considering the other agents in the park had watched her stabilize Sean Goodman, knew she had operated on him, and by now had heard that she had seen Calvin Landry shoot the agent.</p><p>While he had waited for Ellie in the hospital, Max had quickly pulled up all the superficial information on her: her phone numbers; addresses both in St. Louis and in Winston Falls, South Carolina; and her position and schedule at St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital. When he dug a little deeper, however, he uncovered something disturbing: court documents detailing five separate incidents involving Ellie and a teenager named Evan Patterson. The first document was filed when Ellie was only eleven years old. According to the records, Evan, who was seventeen at the time, had become infatuated with the young girl after the two attended a science camp sponsored by the Winston Falls School District. His obsession grew, and when he physically assaulted her, Ellie\u2019s family brought charges against him. Since he was a juvenile with no previous record, he was given leniency.</p><p>The second time, Patterson became more aggressive. He tried to force her into his car. His statement to the police said he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her, that they were kindred spirits, and once she was alone with him, he would be able to convince her that they belonged together. Patterson was given probation with court-ordered therapy.</p><p>Despite the strict rulings of the court, Patterson did not keep his distance, terrorizing the girl on two more occasions. His anger over her rejection had grown to an alarming intensity. For these offenses, he was ordered to undergo yet another psychological evaluation and a thirty-day hospitalization; however, with shrewd attorneys and plea bargains he bypassed judge and jury.</p> <p>There was no plea bargain for the fifth offense of attempted murder.</p><p>Ellie was on her way home from school. She was with three girls who tried to protect her, but Patterson was big and strong. He grabbed Ellie and threw her into his car. The authorities found her two hours later, brutally beaten and left for dead in a ravine two miles out of town.</p><p>By the time she reached the emergency room, she had lost a lot of blood and her prognosis was bleak. She was flown to a trauma center, and the surgeons worked through the night to save her. She spent her twelfth birthday in the ICU.</p><p>\u201cAh, man,\u201d Max whispered as he read the last report. \u201cThat son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>He was sitting in the local FBI office across from his partner, Ben MacBride, who had just hung up the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d Ben asked as Max was closing his laptop.</p><p>\u201cEllie Sullivan\u2019s background.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be bad,\u201d Ben said. \u201cThe look on your face when you were reading... like you wanted to kill someone.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cThen I nailed it.\u201d</p><p>Ben rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to read about her now?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo need.\u201d</p><p>Ben pushed his chair back. \u201cDoes Hughes expect us to file our reports tonight?\u201d</p><p>Max said, \u201cHow long have you been an agent, Ben?\u201d</p><p>His partner laughed. \u201cLong enough to know that I just asked a dumb question. Still, I always hold out hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we get finished at a normal time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in a hurry to get back to the hotel?\u201d</p><p>Ben was going through the drawers in the desk. \u201cNo. I\u2019m in a hurry to eat. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCandy, gum, anything.\u201d He shut the last drawer and shook his head. \u201cMaybe we should move Sullivan\u2019s interview to tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Max stood. \u201cNo, we need to talk to her tonight while it\u2019s still fresh in her mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m betting she won\u2019t be forgetting what happened for a long while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. We need to do it tonight,\u201d he countered, walking to the door.</p><p>Ben trailed behind. \u201cOkay, so here\u2019s what we do. We talk to her quick, grab something to eat, then come back here and finish our reports. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe interview will be quick, won\u2019t it? She\u2019s not one of those arrogant, obnoxious doctor types, is she? If she is, we could be there for hours before we get the information we need. You know what I\u2019m talking about. Some of those older, crabby doctors have the superiority complexes, and they have to impress you with their knowledge before they\u2019ll answer questions. I hate that type. Is she one of those?\u201d</p><p>Max remembered Ben hadn\u2019t met Ellie yet. He had been stationed on the other side of the park when the shooting started, and Max hadn\u2019t felt the need to tell him about her. It was going to be really interesting when he did meet her.</p><p>\u201cIs she that type? Ah, hell, she is, isn\u2019t she? We\u2019ll be there till morning.\u201d</p><p>Max didn\u2019t answer but was smiling as he tossed the car keys to Ben.</p><p>FOUR</p><p>Ellie\u2019s home was a sparsely furnished studio apartment a block west of Cranston and Glenwood. Just five miles from the hospital, it was an easy commute. Her apartment was on the second floor of a redbrick building that sat between two similar structures on a quiet, tree-lined street. Built in the 1940s, it still maintained some of the charm of a bygone era when even the smallest apartments were constructed with high ceilings and intricate moldings. For a studio, it was large and spacious, but it didn\u2019t offer much of a view. Her living room window overlooked the Dumpsters in the back alley.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anything luxurious about the place, but it was home, and she was comfortable there. Each tenant needed a key to get into the front door of the building, and there were strong dead-bolt locks and peepholes on all the apartment doors. The super had keys to each apartment and each dead bolt, which meant he could walk into any apartment anytime, so without asking permission, her father had installed a second dead bolt that only she had the key to unlock.</p><p>If anyone were to ask her to describe her home, she could do it with one word: safe. Or better yet, two words: minimalistic and safe. Almost everything in the apartment was the uninteresting yet soothing color of cream. The walls, the down-filled, oversize sofa she\u2019d purchased for forty dollars from a pampered housewife in Chesterfield who had grown tired of it just six months after she had bought it, the oversize chair she\u2019d thrown in for free, the drapes, the blinds-all cream. The only break in Ellie\u2019s furniture color scheme came from a swivel chair a friend had given her. It was beige.</p><p>There were hardwood floors throughout, which was one of the reasons she had rented the place. The faded and worn-out floors were in desperate need of refinishing, but Ellie loved them because she felt the flaws gave them a lovely patina. They were also much easier than carpet to keep clean.</p><p>She did try to give her place a little personality. She bought a couple of brightly colored pillows from Macy\u2019s midnight madness sale, and she thought they added a little cheer. She would have loved to have covered the walls with beautiful contemporary paintings, but she couldn\u2019t afford them. She shopped at Goodwill, not Neiman Marcus.</p><p>The desk she had purchased from Goodwill had cost only fifteen dollars. One leg was considerably shorter than the other three, but a brick she found when she took the trash out was the exact size needed to balance the desk perfectly. She also purchased a pretty red lacquered tray for two dollars that was only slightly chipped on two corners, and a seriously battered coffee table that cost seven dollars. Added up, she spent less than a hundred dollars to furnish the living room and twice that much to have the sofa and chair cleaned.</p><p>She had no dining room, which was just as well since she had no dining room furniture. A wide, arched doorway separated the living room from the bedroom. Ellie splurged and bought a gorgeous dark cherry, queen-size sleigh bed and a new mattress and box springs. The bed took up most of the space in the tiny alcove disguised as a bedroom and faced the front door, and since it was the first thing a guest saw when he or she walked inside, Ellie decided to blow her budget on a beautiful duvet, a down comforter, and designer sheets. She found a sale and saved 60 percent on the bedding, including four pillows. Ellie thought it humorous that, because of the sale, the only color left on the shelf was cream. The bed did look gorgeous, though, and she loved slipping between the soft cotton sheets.</p><p>The bathroom was surprisingly large, but the galley kitchen was so narrow, only one adult could work in it. Ellie had to stand to one side of the burners to open the oven door. The appliances were new when she moved in, and there was enough counter space to suit her needs.</p><p>Max had told Ellie to stay home, and she planned to do just that after she stopped at Whole Foods to get groceries. She was in the mood for stir-fry with chicken and mounds of vegetables. Just thinking about food made her stomach grumble, and no wonder, she hadn\u2019t eaten anything since the PowerBar and orange juice she\u2019d inhaled at breakfast.</p><p>She ended up with three large bags of groceries. She emptied the contents onto her kitchen counter and reached for an apple to eat while she checked her answering machine for messages. There were only two, neither of which required quick attention. Ellie hadn\u2019t wanted to spend money on a landline, but her father had insisted. He didn\u2019t trust cell phones. What if the charge was low and she got into trouble? How could she call for help? Ellie let her father win the argument because she wanted to give him peace of mind.</p><p>After she checked the time, she showered, blew her hair dry, and put on a pair of faded jeans, a pink T-shirt, and flip-flops. She even took the time to dab on some perfume and add a little lip gloss before starting dinner. She made enough for six meals, munching on salad while she worked. The two agents arrived just as she finished eating.</p><p>Ellie silently lectured herself on the way to the door. Okay, you\u2019re not a teenager, she reminded herself. This time she was going to take it all in stride or, rather, take him in stride. No heart palpitations, no breathlessness, just an ordinary \u201cHi, how are you doing?\u201d Normal, she thought. She was going for normal.</p><p>The best-laid plans...</p><p>She opened the door, and boom, her heart started pounding. It really was the most amazing thing, having absolutely no control over her physical response to him.</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t give her a hint as to what he was thinking, yet she was certain he wasn\u2019t having the same crazy, heart-pounding reaction to her. But then, why would he? If she weren\u2019t a potential witness, he probably wouldn\u2019t have given her the time of day.</p><p>\u201cSomething smells good,\u201d Max remarked as he walked past her.</p><p>\u201cI just made stir-fry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that smells good, too.\u201d</p><p>Ben heard the comment and rolled his eyes as he followed Max into the apartment.</p><p>When Max turned around, Ben was staring at Ellie, spellbound. Ben shook his head and shot an accusatory look at Max, who responded with a satisfied grin. Maybe he should have told Ben about her, but seeing the expression on his partner\u2019s face was priceless. Ellie looked amazing with her hair down around her shoulders. The snug jeans and T-shirt hugged her slender body and long legs and showed the curves that had been hidden by the scrubs. The woman was just about perfect.</p><p>He glanced around her apartment and liked that, too. It was simply furnished, but there were a couple of bright touches that made it feel warm. He smiled when he spotted the brick wedged under one of the legs of the desk. A couple of packing boxes sat in the corner, and neat piles of papers were stacked on the desk and a chair.</p><p>Ellie shut the door and automatically flipped both dead bolts. She offered her hand as Ben MacBride introduced himself. He wasn\u2019t as tall or as muscular as Max, but he had an athletic build and a nice smile that instantly put her at ease.</p><p>Ben turned back to Max and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Max said.</p><p>\u201cYou could have mentioned...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMentioned what?\u201d he asked innocently.</p><p>Ben decided to be blunt. \u201cThat she was frickin\u2019 beautiful.\u201d He quickly turned to Ellie to add, \u201cYou remind me of my wife. She\u2019s beautiful. At least I think she\u2019s still beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Ellie gave him a quizzical look. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time I see her, she\u2019s in the bathroom throwing up. But, yeah, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s still beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes. Man, it does smell good in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStir-fry,\u201d she repeated. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty left, and it\u2019s still hot. Would you like-\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother to finish her question because both Max and Ben were already in her kitchen. Max looked for plates as Ben sampled a piece of chicken. While they devoured every bit of the stir-fry, Ellie straightened up her living room. Her desk was covered with stacks of papers, and there was another stack on the swivel chair that she needed to go through and decide to either shred or pack for storage. She quickly moved the papers from the chair to form another stack on top of the desk. It looked a bit precarious, but as long as no one bumped the desk, the papers should stay put.</p><p>The two agents set their empty plates in the sink and joined her. When they were standing in her living room, the small area seemed even smaller. Ellie went to the sofa and sat down. Ben took the swivel chair and turned it to face her.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Ellie,\u201d he said. \u201cThe food was great. I didn\u2019t realize how hungry I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoyed it,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Max moved around the room as though he were inspecting it. He seemed uptight, unlike the man she had met earlier who appeared to be so relaxed.</p><p>\u201cIs there something you need, Agent Daniels?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMax,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cNo, I just noticed you don\u2019t have anything on your walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything I like is too expensive, and I don\u2019t want to put up posters. I had enough of those in college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re poor,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought doctors made a lot of money.\u201d Max made the comment.</p><p>\u201cSome do,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut, like many of my colleagues, I have substantial student loans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they pay you at that hospital?\u201d Max snapped the question.</p><p>\u201cYes, they do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMust not be much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He slowly circled her living room, acting like a caged animal searching for a way out. Ellie had the feeling he was angry about something and trying to keep it in check.</p><p>\u201cWhat about photos? I know you have family. Don\u2019t you like them?\u201d Max asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI like some of them, and, yes, I do have photos. They\u2019re packed away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are they packed away?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finished at St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital on Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>The rapid-fire questions continued until she began to feel like a suspect, not a witness. Irritated, she started to answer just as rapidly.</p><p>\u201cThose boxes in the corner by the window have been sitting there a long time. There\u2019s dust on top of them. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bad housekeeper,\u201d she said with a straight face.</p><p>\u201cYou never unpacked them?\u201d He made the question sound like an accusation.</p><p>\u201cNo, I never did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady to pick up and leave at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d she snapped back.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He stopped pacing and was now standing over her, making her extremely nervous. How could she have ever thought he was relaxed? She was beginning to think she should confess something just to get him to stop interrogating her.</p><p>Ben was watching the exchange, astounded by Max\u2019s aggressive behavior. Had he been alone with his partner, he would have asked him what in God\u2019s name was wrong with him. He was acting as though he were about to pounce on her.</p><p>\u201cYou must have some idea where you\u2019d like to go,\u201d Max challenged.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she answered sharply. \u201cIs there any other personal information you need?\u201d</p><p>Seeing Ellie\u2019s indignation and suddenly realizing he\u2019d sounded as though he were grilling her, he said, \u201cI guess I\u2019m not very good at small talk.\u201d</p><p>That was small talk?</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Ben drawled.</p><p>Max could see the scowl deepening on Ellie\u2019s face, and he could almost feel the fire flashing from her eyes. He would have laughed had she not looked so annoyed. When he\u2019d first met her, his opinion of her had been rather indifferent. Of course, he\u2019d noticed that she was a beautiful, sexy woman he would love to take to bed. Nothing unusual about that. But then he\u2019d watched how great she was with Sean Goodman. She was so calm and reassuring as she worked on him. Maybe it was all part of her job, but her kindness seemed genuine. Then, when she went back to the hospital to perform Sean\u2019s surgery, Max\u2019s impression of her expanded. Not only did he want to go to bed with her, he admired her as well. And when she gave him a little attitude in the stairwell and let him see her sense of humor, he realized he actually liked her... and wanted her. Nothing unusual about that.</p><p>He saw everything in a different light, however, when he\u2019d checked into her background. Not quite everything, he qualified. He wanted her in bed-that didn\u2019t change-but he was filled with an overwhelming need to protect her. After reading her file, which was only a small portion of what she had gone through, Max felt great empathy for her. She had been powerless back then, with no control over what happened to her. He knew all about that, and that was why he wanted to help as much as he could. Ellie had been through enough. She didn\u2019t need more heartache. And if she testified...</p><p>Max didn\u2019t respond to Ellie\u2019s question. Instead, he surprised her by sitting down next to her on the sofa. He was so close, if she moved, she\u2019d be glued to him. Ellie was confused. What was he doing? There was a perfectly good overstuffed chair he could have taken, and yet he chose the sofa. What did that mean? Ellie didn\u2019t know how to react. Should she move away? She didn\u2019t want to, but should she? Just as she was questioning his motives, Max took a digital recorder out of his pocket. Oh. Now she understood. He had to sit next to her so that the recorder could pick up the conversation. Bummer.</p><p>\u201cBen, are you ready to get started?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m the less experienced agent,\u201d he explained to Ellie. \u201cBy eleven months.\u201d He turned in the swivel chair and accidentally knocked the desk, starting an avalanche of papers to the floor.</p><p>Ellie rushed to help pick up. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess, I know, but I haven\u2019t had time to go through everything. Most of it can probably be thrown away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got this, Ellie. Go sit.\u201d He scooped up several papers, straightened them, and made a pile against the wall. \u201cThey can stay on the floor, right?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Max grabbed another stack of papers that was headed to the floor and put a heavy anatomy book on top to keep them from falling again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Ben held up several sheets that had been stapled together.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cRestraining order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Glancing at Ellie, Max walked around the desk and took the papers from Ben. Just as he expected, they were orders against Evan Patterson. He quickly flipped through them and handed them back to Ben.</p><p>Ben looked over the documents while Ellie remained silent, hoping he wouldn\u2019t read through them.</p><p>\u201cWho is Evan Patterson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, those papers are old,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Ben agreed. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>She had the feeling changing the subject wasn\u2019t going to work. Ben was FBI, which meant he was trained to get people to answer questions, but she wished he\u2019d leave this alone. The subject of Evan Patterson was very difficult for her to talk about or even think about. She wanted the nightmare to stay in the past.</p><p>Ellie settled back on the sofa and pulled a pillow onto her lap. \u201cI went to Sacred Heart High School for two years. He was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he leave high school, or did you?\u201d Ben asked, curious.</p><p>\u201cI was the first to leave... it was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Ben glanced at Max, knowing that he had also picked up on Ellie\u2019s reticence.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go after that?\u201d Ben asked, thinking she had either transferred to another high school or perhaps been homeschooled to get away from Patterson.</p><p>Ellie hesitated before answering. \u201cI was in college.\u201d</p><p>Ben tilted the chair back. He could see her embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re smart, huh?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAnd poor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut real smart?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cProd,\u201d Max said. \u201cChief of surgery calls her Prod.\u201d He turned to her. \u201cThat\u2019s short for prodigy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look happy that he had shared that information.</p><p>\u201cJust one more question. Where\u2019s Evan Patterson now?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. If he was to come back to Winston Falls where my family lives, my father would let me know.\u201d She lifted the pillow and squeezed it to her chest.</p><p>Max could tell she hated talking about Patterson. That was obvious. \u201cI\u2019ll find out where he is now,\u201d he said.</p><p>Frowning, she asked, \u201cWhy? Why would you do that?\u201d</p><p>Because I know what he did to you, he thought. \u201cIt will give you a little peace of mind knowing exactly where he is, won\u2019t it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father has friends in the FBI. Neither one of them could find Patterson. Why do you think you can? Do you think you\u2019re better at it than they are?\u201d</p><p>Did she realize she was repeating the same question the chief of surgery had asked her?</p><p>He decided to answer in kind. \u201cAbsolutely. I am better.\u201d</p><p>She suddenly got it. \u201cYou\u2019re as arrogant as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to the job, yeah, I am.\u201d He continued to stare into her gorgeous eyes as he asked, \u201cDo you want me to find him or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please, but...\u201d She started to say something more then changed her mind. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Ben began. \u201cCatch me up. Did Patterson just decide to leave your hometown, or did something happen?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. And here she thought the conversation was finished. \u201cYes, something happened, and he was committed to the Stockton Institute, for a time anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the Stockton Institute?\u201d</p><p>Max answered. \u201cA state-run facility for the criminally insane. Patterson attacked her, damn near killed her. Read the reports. That will answer some of your questions.\u201d</p><p>Ellie frowned at Max when she said, \u201cYou knew all about Patterson before Ben saw the restraining order, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Before he could answer, she continued, \u201cOf course, you did. My God, it\u2019s only been what? Four? Five hours since we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonger than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get all that information so quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in your file.\u201d</p><p>Her hand went to her throat. \u201cFor anyone to read?\u201d She sounded appalled.</p><p>\u201cNo, not for just anyone.\u201d Then, frowning, he asked, \u201cWhat did you mean, Patterson went to Stockton for a time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t in the file?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Now tell me.\u201d He sounded as though he were grilling her again.</p><p>\u201cPatterson\u2019s family is very wealthy, and they were able to get him transferred to a private facility. And guess what? Eventually he was given weekend passes to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter he tried to kill you?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>Oh God, she was going to have to dredge it all up again. She took a deep breath. \u201cAfter Patterson left me for dead... actually, I was told he thought he had killed me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Ben urged when she hesitated. His tone was softer this time.</p><p>\u201cHe ran, and the police and FBI couldn\u2019t find him right away. So my father, with the help of the two FBI agents who had become friends, decided I needed to go into hiding.\u201d</p><p>Max filled in the blanks for Ben. \u201cThe son of a bitch had been terrorizing her for over a year. He\u2019d even grabbed her a couple of times, but she was able to get away. He wasn\u2019t going to give up until he killed her.\u201d</p><p>Ellie continued. \u201cAs soon as I was ready to leave the hospital, my father drove me here. One of his friends introduced him to a couple, the Wheatleys. They took me in. They\u2019re both teachers and very kind people. They had no children of their own, and they opened their home to me.\u201d For the first time since the topic had come up, she smiled. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know what to do with me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t expound, and neither Ben nor Max pressed.</p><p>\u201cThey took good care of me,\u201d she said. \u201cI stayed with them while I finished college and all the way through medical school and part of residency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re finishing your residency now,\u201d Ben concluded.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve already finished my residency. Now I\u2019m finishing my fellowship in trauma. Are we done talking about Patterson?\u201d</p><p>Ben nodded. \u201cAlmost. One last question, and we\u2019ll move on. Just tell me, when did Patterson get released?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been in and out for the past ten years. About six months ago, my father heard he\u2019d gotten out and vanished. The attorneys were supposed to keep watch, and so were my father\u2019s friends, but none of them were informed of his release. It was by chance that my father heard about him.\u201d She clasped her hands together emphatically and said, \u201cNow I\u2019m done talking about this. You\u2019re here to interview me about the shooting, remember? So why don\u2019t you get to it.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded to Ben, who pulled his chair closer to the coffee table and said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s start. Go ahead and turn the recorder on, Max.\u201d</p><p>Ben stated the date, time, location, and the names of the people in the room for the recorder, then asked, \u201cDr. Sullivan, did you see Agent Sean Goodman get shot?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell us what happened from the time you left the hospital. It\u2019s my understanding you were going for a run. Isn\u2019t that right? Why don\u2019t you start there.\u201d</p><p>Now that the subject of Patterson was off the table, Ellie could take a deep breath without feeling as though her chest was trying to crush her. She tried to be as accurate as possible as she told what she had seen, and then she patiently answered a myriad of questions. She didn\u2019t have as much trouble describing the man who shot Agent Goodman as she did the strange woman, but she stressed that she didn\u2019t think she would be able to point either of them out in a courtroom.</p><p>\u201cHe looked directly at me, but he had sunglasses on. I could see the sweat on his face. The sunglasses slipped down his nose, and I saw his eyes, but only for a second, then he swung the gun around, and I dropped to the ground.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDescribe him for me,\u201d Ben requested.</p><p>\u201cHe was around six feet tall. He wore a brown windbreaker and black pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was dressed all in black. Black slacks, black top. She was shorter than he was, around five seven, and I\u2019d guess her weight to be about one hundred thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did you notice about her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was freaky looking. She was wearing a black wig, but it was askew. And her eyes didn\u2019t look real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, not real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sort of... glowed. Definitely contacts,\u201d she added quickly so he wouldn\u2019t think she was nuts. \u201cIt all happened so fast, and they had their heads turned away from me most of the time.\u201d</p><p>Ben calmly led her through more questions. He seemed laidback about it all, but Ellie was certain it was all an act to put her at ease. She knew from past experience that when a policeman or federal agent was harmed, the city went into lockdown mode until the culprit or culprits were apprehended. Sean Goodman was not only a friend, he was also a fellow agent. Taking it all in stride? Not possible.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Agent Goodman? He saw them,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ben nodded. \u201cYes, he did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSean saw a man and a woman moving fast toward the street. We\u2019re not sure if he saw their faces before he was shot, and like you said, they obviously tried to change their appearance,\u201d Max explained.</p><p>\u201cIf he had gotten closer...,\u201d Ben began.</p><p>Ellie shook her head, stopping him. \u201cHad he gotten closer, the bullet would have done a lot more damage, especially if he was hit in the chest. Those wounds are... messy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t he wearing a vest?\u201d Ben asked Max. \u201cDo you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was supposed to stay in the van, but the second he got out, he should have put the vest on. Farber and Stanley had taken their vests off,\u201d he added. \u201cThey thought it was all over. Maybe Sean thought that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe he did,\u201d Ben allowed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about those kids who ran into the street to flag down the ambulance? They must have seen the couple running away,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t see their faces.\u201d Max sounded irritated again.</p> <p>\u201cThere were people all over the park. Could someone else have gotten a better-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve checked,\u201d he barked and turned the recorder off.</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cAre you always this grumpy?\u201d</p><p>Surprised by her question, he repeated, \u201cGrumpy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he is kind of grumpy today,\u201d Ben interjected.</p><p>\u201cThe hell I am.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Ellie moved the pillow out of her way and stood. \u201cI\u2019m getting a Diet Coke. You two want anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll take a Coke,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>She turned to Max. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have called you grumpy. You\u2019ve had a bad day. Your friend was shot, and from what you\u2019ve told me, the plan to apprehend these people fell apart.\u201d She headed toward the kitchen and added, \u201cSo it\u2019s okay to be grumpy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s usually real cheery.\u201d Ben laughed as he told the lie. His cell phone vibrated, and he quickly read the text.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ellie, could I ask you a medical question?\u201d</p><p>She peeked around the corner. \u201cSure. What do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean when a pregnant woman has all the symptoms of indigestion?\u201d</p><p>She thought he was joking until he looked up from his text, and she saw the concern in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt means she has indigestion.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t convinced. He read his wife\u2019s symptoms aloud, told Ellie that she was four months along, and that she had miscarried their first child at exactly four months.</p><p>Ellie reached for her cell phone. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAddison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me her cell phone number.\u201d</p><p>Leaning against the doorway she began to text, her thumbs tapping out her message with lightning speed.</p><p>Ben was impressed. \u201cYou\u2019re fast.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for a while.\u201d</p><p>Ellie gave Ben\u2019s wife suggestions to help with the indigestion and ended the message by telling Addison she could text her with other questions when she needed to.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Ben said when she had finished. \u201cShe worries.\u201d</p><p>Ellie gave him her cell phone number. \u201cIf you have concerns, you can text me, too.\u201d</p><p>When Ellie returned with the Cokes, she handed one to Ben and took her seat next to Max.</p><p>\u201cWill Sean get into trouble because he didn\u2019t wear his vest?\u201d</p><p>Max answered. \u201cHe did get into trouble. He got shot, remember?\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t what she meant, but she didn\u2019t pursue the matter.</p><p>Max turned the recorder back on. \u201cBen, do you have any other questions you want to ask Ellie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think we\u2019re done for now,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be around, though, aren\u2019t you? You aren\u2019t taking off for Europe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you forget the \u2018I\u2019m poor\u2019 part of the interview?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cRight. So no Europe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be going to Winston Falls for a wedding next week, but until then I\u2019ll be here, and you can always get me on my cell phone.\u201d</p><p>Once again, Max hit the button to turn the recorder off just as Ben asked, \u201cWhere is Winston Falls?\u2019</p><p>\u201cSouth Carolina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie\u2019s family lives there. It\u2019s her hometown,\u201d Max volunteered.</p><p>\u201cHow often do you get back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going anywhere after the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll come back here... for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re finished,\u201d Max announced and started to stand. Ellie put her hand on his knee to stop him.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn to ask questions,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works,\u201d he replied.</p><p>She ignored his comment. \u201cWhy were they in the park?\u201d</p><p>Ben answered her. \u201cThe FBI has been following them since the last case didn\u2019t make it to court, and when we heard about the buy, we set a trap. Max and I wanted in on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the buy? Drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeapons,\u201d he said. \u201cVery sophisticated weapons.\u201d</p><p>Before she could ask him another question, his cell phone rang. He saw who was calling and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to take this.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared into her kitchen for some privacy before he answered his phone. Ellie turned to Max, realized then that her hand was still resting on his leg, and pulled back. \u201cWhat did he mean, the last case didn\u2019t make it to court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitnesses couldn\u2019t testify.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t push him to explain, but said, \u201cWhat went wrong in the park?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of things.\u201d</p><p>It was as much as he was going to tell her, she realized after waiting several seconds. She tried another question. \u201cBen said the FBI has been following them, so you know who they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t immediately answer, she gave him a good nudge with her foot. He was so surprised, he smiled. \u201cDid you just kick a federal agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I nudged a federal agent. I\u2019m getting ready to kick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalvin and Erika Landry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, was that so hard?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and she was happy to see the tension ease from his face for a second.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of them,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you had. They don\u2019t usually do business here. We\u2019ve had other dealings with them. Fact is, we\u2019ve been chasing them for some time. We knew about the deal that was going down at the park, and we were hoping we could catch them in the act. Unfortunately, they got away before anyone could identify them. That\u2019s why eyewitnesses to the shooting are so important. Too many agents have been working on this for too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you live in St. Louis? I\u2019m just curious about who\u2019s involved in this case,\u201d she hastened to add so he wouldn\u2019t think she was being too personal.</p><p>Max stood, slipped the recorder into his pocket, and said, \u201cFor the past six years I\u2019ve lived in Honolulu.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why she was so bummed out by the news, but she was. She hardly knew the man, and he definitely was all wrong for her. Yet there was just something about him... The truth was, she had never had such an immediate attraction to any other man before, not even her ex-fianc\u00e9, though she\u2019d be loath to admit it.</p><p>It was all so confusing. She didn\u2019t want a relationship with Max, but she wanted the possibility of one? She wasn\u2019t making any sense.</p><p>Her brain chemistry was all messed up, she decided, and that was why her physical reaction to him was so intense. That was it exactly. Her endorphins were going haywire. Sleep deprivation was probably one reason for the imbalance, and being a workaholic with no social outlets was probably another.</p><p>There was one other theory: She was crazy, just plain crazy.</p><p>Ben finished his call and was leaning against the door frame, drinking his Diet Coke. He pulled away when Max said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Ellie going on the witness list?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Max shook his head. \u201cAgent Hughes is running this, remember? If Ellie\u2019s name goes on that list, you know what will happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you and I could stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Honolulu? Not possible.\u201d</p><p>Stop what, Ellie wondered. She waited for Max or Ben to explain, but neither did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you Hughes will want-\u201d</p><p>Max cut him off. \u201cI said no.\u201d He walked to the door and unbolted the locks.</p><p>Ben turned to put his drink on the kitchen counter and headed to the door that Max was holding open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be more helpful,\u201d Ellie said, a bit puzzled by their brusque departure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Max started to pull the door closed but stopped abruptly. He stood for a second as though weighing his thoughts before saying, \u201cAre there any good restaurants around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you like Italian, you should go to the Hill. There\u2019s a great restaurant called the Trellis. You\u2019ll love it. It\u2019s casual dress. You\u2019ll see everything from suits to shorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll pick you up at seven tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>He shut the door before she had time to react.</p><p>\u201cWait... what?\u201d</p><p>FIVE</p><p>Finding out who the blond runner was on the track turned out to be surprisingly easy.</p><p>A shoot-out on hospital grounds with FBI agents swarming all over the park was big news. Every local station led the evening broadcast with a report about the downed agent and the hunt for the perpetrators. The hospital was still buzzing about the incident. The staff, the volunteers, even the patients wanted to rehash the event. Some even did a bit of embellishing.</p><p>Willis Cogburn knew how the gossip grapevine worked and used it to his advantage. Dressed as a deliveryman for a local florist, he carried a potted plant with Agent Sean Goodman\u2019s name on it into the hospital. It was late afternoon when he made the delivery, and the lobby was empty except for a few volunteers milling around behind the reception desk waiting to help anyone who wanted assistance.</p><p>An older, white-haired gentleman, wearing the name tag \u201cRoland,\u201d looked up the number of the patient\u2019s room, marked it on a Post-It, and stuck it to the bright red bow attached to the plant before setting it on a cart with other floral arrangements ready for delivery.</p><p>Willis didn\u2019t have to ask where Sean Goodman was. All he had to do was engage the volunteer in conversation while he leaned over the counter and read the room number.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that FBI agent doing? I sure hope he\u2019s going to make it,\u201d Willis asked sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s almost as good as new,\u201d Roland said. \u201cOne of the aides told me they already moved him out of ICU into a private room. He might even get to go home as early as the day after tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d Willis said. Shaking his head, he added, \u201cYou all had quite a commotion here, didn\u2019t you? Were you on duty?\u201d</p><p>Roland vigorously nodded. \u201cI sure was, but I didn\u2019t see any of it happen, thank goodness. I didn\u2019t even hear the gunshots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly did happen?\u201d</p><p>Roland was eager to recount what he had heard, and when he had finished, another volunteer named Bill added a few facts.</p><p>\u201cThe way I heard it,\u201d Bill began, \u201ca man and a woman were running away from the federal agents, and then suddenly the man turned around and shot the agent closing in on them.\u201d</p><p>Roland plopped down in a swivel chair and rested his elbows on the arms. \u201cThat\u2019s how I heard it, too,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cDid they catch the man and woman yet?\u201d Willis asked, knowing full well they hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bill said.</p><p>\u201cBut they will,\u201d Roland interjected. \u201cAnd when they do, that pair will be put away for a long time. You don\u2019t get off with a light sentence when you shoot a federal agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard why the FBI was after them?\u201d Willis asked, leaning on the counter as though he had all the time in the world to chat.</p><p>\u201cI heard it was a sting operation,\u201d Bill answered eagerly. \u201cThey were selling guns or drugs or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roland shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I heard. One of the secretaries in admissions told me the security guard said they were passing government secrets.\u201d</p><p>Before the two men could get into an argument, Willis steered the conversation in another direction. \u201cDoes the FBI know who they\u2019re looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI agents and cops have been crawlin\u2019 all over the place trying to get information, looking for witnesses,\u201d Roland said.</p><p>\u201cMiles down in X-ray told me the agent was close enough he could identify them if he had to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Willis replied. \u201cYou know what I heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Roland asked.</p><p>\u201cThere was a girl on the track who might have seen the whole thing. Someone said she was a high school kid running laps.\u201d</p><p>Roland snorted. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any girl on the track,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s our own Dr. Sullivan. Does she look like she\u2019s in high school to you, Bill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course she doesn\u2019t. More like college age.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of doctor is she?\u201d Willis asked.</p><p>\u201cSurgeon,\u201d Bill answered. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who took the bullet out of the agent. Lucky for him she was there when he got shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure is,\u201d Willis said. \u201cAny other witnesses that you know of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure if anyone else got close enough to see the man and woman, the FBI will find them. They\u2019ve been talking to everyone around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Roland agreed. \u201cThey stopped me on my way in this afternoon to ask me questions.\u201d</p><p>After a few more minutes of conversation, Willis Cogburn was on his way to his car. He\u2019d parked in the back lot so no one would see he wasn\u2019t driving a florist van. Once he was inside, he made a call.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t waste time on a greeting but said, \u201cGoodman will be going home at the earliest the day after tomorrow. He\u2019s in room four twelve, so you can keep tabs on him in case they let him go sooner. Remember, George, we don\u2019t do anything until Cal gives us the go-ahead. Just be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find out who the girl is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, let\u2019s get this done. The sooner the better to my way of thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your call. You know the instructions. I get her at the same time you get Goodman. Cal doesn\u2019t want any deviations from his plan. He wants it to happen simultaneously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCal doesn\u2019t even know for certain if Goodman or the girl can ID him or Erika,\u201d George pointed out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a careful man,\u201d Willis replied. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t take chances, and he\u2019s paying us a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d George said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t get the rest of the money until the job\u2019s done, and like I said, the sooner the better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow many times do I have to say it? We wait for the go-ahead.\u201d Willis all but shouted into the phone. \u201cYou were in the army, for God\u2019s sake. Show a little discipline. You should be used to taking orders. You don\u2019t want to get on Cal\u2019s bad side. I brought you in because you\u2019re my little brother, George, but my neck is on the line here. Don\u2019t screw this up. If you do the job right, he\u2019ll want to use you again, and each time you\u2019ll make more money until you\u2019re a regular like me. Be patient.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, George was not the patient kind.</p><p>SIX</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the worst invitation Ellie had ever received. The fact was, it didn\u2019t even make the top ten. Still, it was strange, and the question remained: Had Max actually asked her out? She replayed the conversation in her mind several times and decided, no, he hadn\u2019t asked. He\u2019d told.</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t even a real date. Ben would probably be with him. The two of them were in town for only a short while, and they needed someone who was familiar with the city to take them to a good restaurant. Yes, that was it... maybe.</p><p>Every time she thought about it, she laughed. Max had left his card on the coffee table with his cell phone number. She could have called and canceled, but she didn\u2019t. Instead, she spent an hour the next afternoon going through her pitiful wardrobe, trying on one outfit after another, and finally settling on a black-and-white sundress with a full skirt and a boatneck. The fit through the waist was snug, and the length reached mid-knee. She decided to wear her new-last-year black ballet flats. It was either those or her flip-flops, unless she wanted to wear tennis shoes. The heels she\u2019d worn to the hospital banquet last month were out of the question. Her feet had ached for a week afterward.</p><p>She would have put on some cool jewelry, but she didn\u2019t own any. She did have a silver heart her grandmother had given her for her eighteenth birthday, but the chain was broken, and she hadn\u2019t had time to get it fixed.</p><p>Hair brushed and down around her shoulders; makeup, perfume, and body lotion applied-she was good to go.</p><p>She was ready at seven and he was on time. He looked surprised when he saw her, as though he expected someone else.</p><p>\u201cYou look nice,\u201d he said.</p><p>So did he. He\u2019d gotten a haircut and shaved. He still looked intimidating, she thought, but then he stood well over six feet and was built like a rock. He couldn\u2019t really look any other way. Black pants, light blue shirt with the sleeves rolled back at the wrists, open collar, and the gun... the ever-present gun at his side.</p><p>He pulled the door closed and waited as she used her keys to lock both dead bolts. She dropped her keys into her purse and headed down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cIs Ben joining us?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cDo you usually go out with two guys at the same time?\u201d</p><p>She turned to him. \u201cThen this is a date?\u201d</p><p>They reached his rental car, a new SUV. He opened the door for her and said, \u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>Before she could ask him to explain, he changed the subject. \u201cI made the reservation for seven thirty, but I got busy and didn\u2019t download directions. Do you know the way? Or should I pull up the GPS?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the way. What\u2019s a \u2018sort of\u2019 date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about no business talk until after dinner?\u201d</p><p>Business? What kind of business? So it wasn\u2019t a date. That realization led to the question: Okay, what did he want? And since it was business of a sort, why wasn\u2019t Ben included?</p><p>Might as well find out, she decided. \u201cWhat\u2019s your partner doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou did a good thing for his wife. Addison worries.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYes, I know she does. I got three texts from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not bad. Three texts in what? Twenty-four hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, three texts in one hour,\u201d she corrected. \u201cBy eleven o\u2019clock Friday night we were BFFs. She\u2019s very nice. A little neurotic about the baby, but I understand why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like her if you met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do like her. I talked to her for about an hour this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>She crossed one leg over the other and noticed he was noticing. They were at a stop sign, but he didn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry to move on.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re finished checking out my legs, turn left.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t at all embarrassed. \u201cThey\u2019re great-looking legs,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m hungry. How much farther is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot far,\u201d she answered, turning toward him. He had a beautiful profile. Square jaw, great bone structure. Everything about him emanated strength and made her feel safe, but then a gun and a badge would do that. However, Ellie felt there was much more to him than his outward appearance revealed, and she was eager to find out what was behind those intense eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Honolulu like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful. It\u2019s always beautiful there, but the city\u2019s crowded. Why don\u2019t you come see for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to surf,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a requirement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurf? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks fun,\u201d she remarked. \u201cI would like to visit Honolulu someday. The climate appeals to me, especially in January with the ice storms and snow here. You told me you\u2019ve lived there for six years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you grow up? Certainly not Hawaii.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Why not?\u201d he asked, glancing at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too...\u201d She started to say, \u201cuptight,\u201d then changed her mind. \u201cRugged,\u201d she finished. \u201cOh, we\u2019re here. Restaurant\u2019s right around the corner. Parking\u2019s in back.\u201d</p><p>A car pulled away from the curb and Max pulled his car into the spot. He opened her door and waited for her to explain her evaluation of him, but she just smiled as she stepped onto the sidewalk and headed toward the awning over the restaurant\u2019s front door. He couldn\u2019t help but notice how her h*ps moved as she walked away from him.</p><p>He caught up with her. \u201cRugged, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly rugged,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just something about you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What if I told you I grew up in Los Angeles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re nuts. You know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Did you grow up in Los Angeles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t. The people there are much more laidback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, these sweeping statements of yours...\u201d</p><p>They entered the restaurant, and he muttered, \u201cI hate crowds.\u201d He took her arm and led her to the podium, where an elegantly dressed woman stood with a reservation book in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYour table will be ready momentarily, Mr. Daniels,\u201d she said with a gracious smile. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to wait in the bar, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>Max rounded the corner and saw that the bar area was packed as well. He spotted one empty stool at the end of the bar and had just put his hand on the small of her back to guide her toward it when a large man with a jovial face called to Ellie from across the room. After threading his way around the tables to get to them, the man threw his massive arms around Ellie and kissed her on both cheeks.</p><p>The owner of the Trellis, Tommy Greco, was a former boxer whose nose had been broken more than once. Word had it that he was ruthless in the ring, but outside he was a gentle man, kind and soft-spoken. Nothing much ever riled him, except maybe putting too much garlic in his famous chicken spiedini.</p><p>He released Ellie from his grip and said, \u201cYour boyfriend has a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt goes with the badge,\u201d she replied.</p><p>She stepped back and quickly introduced the two men.</p><p>\u201cI heard about that shooting,\u201d he said to Max. Turning to Ellie, he added, \u201cAnd I heard you operated on the agent who took the bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy, how did you know I did the surgery?\u201d she asked. She knew the shooting had been on the news, of course, and in the papers, but the surgeon\u2019s name wasn\u2019t mentioned.</p><p>\u201cCome on, kid, you know I hear everything that happens in this town.\u201d</p><p>He led them to a table secluded from the others in a quiet niche. \u201cYou two get the executive table tonight,\u201d he said. Wiggling his eyebrows, he added, \u201cLots of privacy.\u201d</p><p>He unfolded her napkin and dropped it into her lap. \u201cIt was nice meeting you, Agent Daniels. You take good care of my girl, you hear me. Has she told you how we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Max answered.</p><p>\u201cMake her tell you about the golfer who came in with his friends a while back. It happened just after I opened the restaurant.\u201d Tommy suddenly spotted someone else he knew across the room and was off with his arms spread wide to greet them.</p><p>Alone again, Ellie was intent on asking Max why he had asked her out, but a waiter appeared to take their drink order. When he walked away, she turned back to Max.</p><p>Before she could get her question out, he said, \u201cButte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cButte, Montana. That\u2019s where I was born and where I grew up.\u201d</p><p>She slapped the tabletop. \u201cAh, of course. Now you make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you don\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he countered.</p><p>How could she explain it so that he understood? Not possible, she decided. He did make sense to her now, though. There was an unbridled energy about him, and to her he seemed a maverick and a little on the wild side. Yes, that was it. As wild and untamed as the Montana landscape.</p><p>Max was looking at her as if she\u2019d lost her mind, and Ellie realized she needed to curb her imagination. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you didn\u2019t ask me out so that I\u2019d show you a nice restaurant. What did you want to talk to me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have dinner first. What sounds good to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh. You\u2019re avoiding the subject, which means it\u2019s bad.\u201d</p><p>He was as good at switching topics as she was. \u201cHow come Tommy calls you \u2018kid\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe introduced me to some of his father\u2019s friends who all happened to be in their eighties, and to them I was a kid, I guess. He called me the kid doctor, which, by the way, I didn\u2019t like. I told him so, and he stopped. So don\u2019t you try it.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI won\u2019t. And for the record, I don\u2019t think of you as a kid. I barely glanced at you when we first met. All I saw were shorts and a ponytail.\u201d And legs, he admitted to himself, long, perfect legs. \u201cWhen I look at you now,\u201d he said, his eyes looking deeply into hers, \u201cthe last thing I see is a kid.\u201d</p><p>Ellie could feel the blood rushing to her head and her heart pounding again. She quickly picked up a menu and pretended to study it. When she glimpsed at him a few seconds later, he was still staring at her, but this time there was a concerned look on his face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time you told me why we\u2019re here,\u201d she said, laying the menu on the table.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he admitted. He leaned forward. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something I would normally do...\u201d</p><p>Seeing his hesitation, Ellie became anxious. \u201cJust tell me,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cThis stays between you and me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, okay,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change your story,\u201d he said finally.</p><p>\u201cWhat story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour account of the shooting,\u201d he explained. \u201cDon\u2019t change any of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I change it?\u201d she asked, perplexed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAs this investigation progresses, you might be questioned again, either by the police or by the FBI, especially Agent Hughes. He may try to lead you or even coerce you to remember details you couldn\u2019t recall before. Don\u2019t tell him or anyone else more than you told Ben and me, that you didn\u2019t see the couple well enough to recognize them.\u201d</p><p>Max had become so serious and his tone so persistent, Ellie wondered why he was telling her this. Her thoughts went back to the conversations they\u2019d had in her apartment.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told me much about this case or the people you\u2019ve been chasing. You said their name was Landry, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you said you\u2019ve been trying to catch them for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the Landrys moved to Honolulu and started doing business there, Ben and I were brought in. They were arrested, and the case was solid. We had three witnesses, but as I already mentioned, the case never made it to court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me why it didn\u2019t make it to court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo of the witnesses disappeared. We\u2019re still looking for them, but no luck so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the third witness?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKilled in a hit-and-run.\u201d</p><p>Ellie felt a shiver run down her arms.</p><p>Max let her absorb the information before continuing. \u201cWe need eyewitnesses who will testify against them, people who can positively connect them to a crime. But if those eyewitnesses come forward, we\u2019ll have to guarantee their safety. And that\u2019s why, if you have enough information to testify, you\u2019ll probably end up in witness protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, I won\u2019t,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cI know how your life was turned upside down by Evan Patterson. You had to leave your home and your family for all those years. If you have to go into witness protection...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I would never allow that to happen. Max, I\u2019ve spent half my life in hiding,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI think I\u2019ve reached my breaking point. Lately, I\u2019ve felt frozen. I can\u2019t seem to make decisions as to where I want to live, and the idea of signing a contract, even for one year, scares me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re waiting to find out where Patterson is, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Time to admit the truth, she decided. \u201cYes, I am. Even now he\u2019s controlling my life. I hate that. And now you\u2019re suggesting I might have to hide from the Landrys. Enough,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve really had enough. I told you and Ben that I don\u2019t think I can identify either one of the Landrys. Shouldn\u2019t that keep me safe from them?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cMaybe. Just be careful... and stick to your story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she answered. She studied him for a minute, thinking how thoughtful it was of him to try to protect her; then she asked, \u201cCould you get into trouble for telling me about the other investigation that fell apart and about those witnesses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not giving away confidential information. You would have to spend a little time on the Internet searching for articles, but you could find out all about that case. It was in the newspapers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think those two witnesses who disappeared are still alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI think they may have gotten spooked when they heard about the hit-and-run, and they took off.\u201d</p><p>Who could blame them? she thought. She took a breath and said, \u201cThanks for telling me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust promise you\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>He picked up his menu. \u201cAre you ready to order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very hungry.\u201d</p><p>Max read through the menu, and when he glanced up at Ellie again, she was staring into space, lost in thought, absentmindedly turning her spoon over and over on the table. He should have stuck to his guns and waited until after dinner to tell her about the Landrys, but she\u2019d been too perceptive and forced him to give her the news sooner than he\u2019d planned. Way to go, Daniels, he chided himself. Here he was, sitting across from a gorgeous, sexy woman, and all she could think about was the danger that threatened to uproot her life.</p><p>Determined to change her mood, he said, \u201cTell me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a scale of one to ten, how\u2019s the date going so far?\u201d</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>As soon as the waiter had taken their orders and left,Max said, \u201cI think every man in here is staring at you.\u201d</p><p>The comment surprised her, and she looked around. \u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t. Ellie was stunning, and even he, as cynical as he had become, was a bit in awe of her. After spending a short time with her, however, he\u2019d come to realize her appearance didn\u2019t define her.</p><p>Ellie said, \u201cDo you know, when I walked out of ICU and saw you waiting in the hall, I thought you looked so relaxed. I almost envied you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was relaxed.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue, yet the look she gave him indicated she didn\u2019t believe him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I was worried about Goodman,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd I was angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the shooting.\u201d It was a statement, not a question.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course the shooting, but I was also furious that the Landrys got away. We should have had them.\u201d And with what was supposed to be an airtight case this time, he thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Agent Hughes have to do with the investigation?\u201d To clarify, she said, \u201cYou and Ben were talking about him when you were at my apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHughes flew down from Omaha to take charge when he heard the Landrys were involved. He\u2019s been chasing them for about four years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like him much, do you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOur methods are different.\u201d</p><p>Tommy strolled over to their table, refilled their glasses, and handed the pitcher of ice water to a hovering waiter.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Max about the golfers yet?\u201d he asked Ellie.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, it\u2019s a good story. She\u2019s humble,\u201d he told Max. \u201cShe won\u2019t tell you how it really went down, but I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Both Tommy and Max turned to her. There was no getting out of it, she knew.</p><p>\u201cIt turns out I have a bit of a temper when I\u2019m pushed,\u201d she began. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you kept your cool,\u201d Tommy insisted. \u201cIt was that jerk you were with who lost his temper. The guy had an ego the size of Nevada.\u201d To Max he said, \u201cAnd all she did was try not to embarrass him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp to a point,\u201d she interjected.</p><p>\u201cSee, here\u2019s what happened,\u201d Tommy continued. \u201cThere were four men, all of them in their fifties, I\u2019m guessing, sitting at a table across my restaurant from where Ellie and the deadhead were sitting. The golfers were a loud bunch but not offensive. They were just having some fun, and they weren\u2019t bothering any of my other customers. They\u2019d had a lot to drink before they got here. Who could blame them? It was a real pisser out there that day, over ninety degrees.\u201d He turned to Ellie. \u201cAre you gonna help me tell it?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAll of them had ordered steaks,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cGrade A prime. Meat that will melt in your mouth,\u201d Tommy crooned. \u201cI only serve the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happened to look over just as one of the golfers took a bite of his steak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a twenty-one-ounce porterhouse,\u201d Tommy interjected. \u201cOne of the customers\u2019 favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man stuffed a piece the size of a small roast into his mouth. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d she added. \u201cI watched him, hoping he\u2019d keep chewing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t,\u201d Tommy said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing it didn\u2019t melt in his mouth,\u201d Max said.</p><p>\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t.\u201d Ellie continued, \u201cHe swallowed and, of course, began to choke. He tried to stand, then crashed to the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get to see any of this,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cI was busy in the front, but I heard the guy\u2019s friends shouting for help and yelling that their friend was having a heart attack. I ran over to see for myself, and I saw him on the floor. The guy\u2019s face was getting red.\u201d Turning to Ellie again, he said, \u201cGo ahead, you tell what happened next.\u201d Tommy\u2019s enthusiasm was comical.</p><p>\u201cMy date, Dr. Dwight Parish, said, \u2018I\u2019ve got this,\u2019 and ran over to the golfer, whose name I later found out was Chuck,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cChuck the Choker is what I dubbed him,\u201d Tommy added.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Max asked Ellie.</p><p>\u201cI started the clock the second Chuck tried to swallow the meat-\u201d</p><p>He interrupted. \u201cWhat do you mean, you started the clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOxygen deprivation,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere was plenty of time, but I always start the clock, which means I note the time down to the second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe deadhead announces he\u2019s a doctor,\u201d Tommy said, \u201cand he kneels down beside Chuck and starts pushing his chest, giving him CPR. He, too, believed Chuck was having a heart attack. The jerk acted like he was running a seminar or something, talking to the crowd while he pumped Chuck\u2019s chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what happened?\u201d Max wondered.</p><p>\u201cI tried to explain to Dwight that the man was choking,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she did,\u201d Tommy agreed. \u201cI stood beside her. She was real nice about it, but the deadhead wouldn\u2019t listen, even after she told him she\u2019d seen Chuck try to swallow a hunk of meat. Deadhead was too busy dazzling the crowd to pay attention. And all that pumping didn\u2019t dislodge the meat, did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m watching, getting real worried. It\u2019s bad for business when a customer dies in your restaurant.\u201d</p><p>Max had to agree. \u201cYeah, that would be bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know the kid was a doctor then,\u201d he added. \u201cBut she was trying to convince deadhead that Chuck wasn\u2019t having a heart problem-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad anyone called nine-one-one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, of course. So tell him what happened next,\u201d Tommy urged.</p><p>\u201cI was watching the time,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I politely asked Dwight to get out of my way.\u201d</p><p>Max raised an eyebrow. There was something about the way she made the comment that told him she wasn\u2019t quite telling the truth. \u201cPolitely, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you go on, tell me, what kind of doctor is Dwight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just finished his residency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what field?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsychiatry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an important and difficult residency,\u201d she told him. \u201cHowever, Dwight has a Superman complex and was determined to revive the golfer. If he had had paddles, he would have tried to shock him. I say \u2018try\u2019 because I wouldn\u2019t have let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDwight sounds like a jackass,\u201d he commented.</p><p>Tommy nodded vigorously.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so go on,\u201d he urged, caught up in the story, but before she could continue, he asked, \u201cWeren\u2019t you a little worried? What if you couldn\u2019t get the meat out?\u201d</p><p>She looked astonished, as though she couldn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d ask such a silly question.</p><p>\u201cThere was still plenty of time, and I had a backup plan. Clean steak knife, alcohol. If I had to, I\u2019d open his throat. I wasn\u2019t going to let him die. All of what Tommy and I have told you took less than a minute,\u201d she added. \u201cIt sounds like a lot was going on, but it happened really fast. I explained that the man was choking, but Dwight continued to argue that I was wrong, that it was a heart attack. He said he knew the symptoms. He was once again talking more to the crowd than to me, and it was difficult to get a word in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a trauma surgeon,\u201d she reminded Max. \u201cAnd we are trained to take charge. We\u2019re... aggressive when we need to be. I tried to explain to Dwight... but he just wouldn\u2019t listen, so I did what I had to do...\u201d</p><p>Tommy finished for her, \u201cShe used her foot and knocked Dwight out of the way. He landed halfway across the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy helped me get Chuck upright, then I dislodged the meat and pulled it out of his throat. All the while I\u2019m checking the clock. It was all good,\u201d she said. \u201cI still had plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to throw the meat at Dwight, but she wouldn\u2019t let me,\u201d Tommy grumbled.</p><p>\u201cAnd Chuck?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cNo worse for the wear,\u201d Tommy said. He stepped aside to let the waiter set plates in front of them. \u201cYou kids go ahead and eat your salads now, and I\u2019ll check on your dinners.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he left, Max asked, \u201cDid good old Dwight ask you out on another date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I would go?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cSince I had had my fingers down Chuck\u2019s throat, I went to the ladies\u2019 room to wash my hands, and when I came back to the table, Dwight had taken off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>As the evening wore on, Max asked questions about her work. It was obvious that she had a real passion for helping people, and he loved the way her eyes lit up when she talked about them.</p><p>\u201cIt must be stressful at times,\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut what about you? Your job has to be riddled with stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d he admitted. He smiled and added, \u201cAnd then there are those criminals who all but capture themselves. One of my first cases as an agent I barely had to investigate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He put down his fork and leaned back in his chair. \u201cIt was a robbery of a neighborhood bank, a one-man job. I don\u2019t think the robber had much experience, though. When he walked into the bank with a cap pulled down over his eyes and a gun concealed in his pocket, he found the lobby crowded with customers. He was so nervous, he decided he should wait until they had cleared out before going up to the teller to make his demands. But he didn\u2019t want to look suspicious just milling around the bank doing nothing, so he went to a table with some forms stacked on top.</p><p>\u201cIn the surveillance tapes, you could see him pick up the pen and start writing on one of the forms. He must have been pretty distracted because, after he finally made it to the teller and got away with the cash, he didn\u2019t think to pick up the forms he had been filling out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat were they?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cApplications for a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wrote down his name, address... everything we needed to drive to his house and pick him up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe anyone would be that stupid.\u201d</p><p>He nodded agreement. \u201cA friend of mine who\u2019s on the police force in Honolulu told me about a crime he covered where this man went into a convenience store to rob it. He got the money from the cash register and then demanded the clerk hand over a bottle of whiskey, too. Out of habit, the clerk asked to see some form of ID, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave him his ID,\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me another one,\u201d she pleaded, laughing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a hundred of them, but just one more,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite. There was this one guy who tried to rob a bank. He carried a grocery bag to use as a mask to conceal his identity. His ingenious plan was to put it over his head, then throw the front door of the bank open and rush in. He\u2019d cut holes in the bag for his eyes but evidently hadn\u2019t tried it out because, when he put it on, the holes lined up with his forehead. On the tape, you see the guy come barging into the bank with a bag over his head, waving his gun and turning in circles, trying to get the tellers to give him the cash. He was threatening a potted plant.\u201d</p><p>Max liked the way Ellie\u2019s eyes sparkled when she laughed. The waiter appeared with the bill, and he knew it was almost time for them to leave. He was sorry to see the evening end.</p><p>\u201cEllie, if Dwight left you here, how did you get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to take a cab, but Tommy\u2019s wife, Mary, was on her way out the door, and she drove me home. She\u2019s not here tonight, or Tommy would have brought her over to our table to introduce her. He\u2019s very proud of her. They\u2019ve been married for almost thirty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes them unique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound cynical.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to marriage, I guess I am. I\u2019ve had friends whose happily-ever-after lasted about three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents have been married a long time, and they\u2019re not an anomaly.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t comment. \u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>He surprised her by taking her hand as they walked through the restaurant. It wasn\u2019t until they were once again in the car and on their way back to her apartment that she returned to the subject of his cynicism. She wanted to know what had happened to make him so sour.</p><p>\u201cI take it your parents are divorced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019re not. They\u2019ve been married a long time, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re miserable.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, they\u2019re happy together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen it\u2019s just you, unless...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many ex-wives do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d he assured her. \u201cI\u2019ve never been married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny long-term relationships?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cDefine long-term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than three months.\u201d</p><p>He had to think about it. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI like women, Ellie, and the women I take to bed know there isn\u2019t going be a long-term anything.\u201d</p><p>Was it a different woman every night? She didn\u2019t have the nerve to ask.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you involved with anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time,\u201d she said. And no desire in a long while... until you came along, she silently added.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an excuse, not a reason,\u201d he told her. \u201cWhat about friends with benefits... you know... casual sex?\u201d</p><p>The question surprised her. \u201cNo, so far not interested. Some of my friends have sex with friends, and they tell me it releases a lot of stress. It just seems a little too cold and clinical to me.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the ride home was quiet, but she wasn\u2019t uncomfortable with the silence. Ellie kept thinking about her answers to his questions. No sex, no friends with benefits, no involvement... My God, she\u2019d made herself sound like a female eunuch. And a bore.</p><p>Max parked in front of her building and walked inside with her. He insisted on checking her apartment to make sure it was safe, which Ellie appreciated. It took as long as a hiccup. She waited by her door as he looked around. Soft light from a single lamp illuminated the living room.</p><p>\u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d she asked as he walked toward her.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>He was inches away. She swallowed and said, \u201cI have to tell you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked as he planted his hands against the door on either side of her.</p><p>\u201cI liked the date portion of the evening much better than the serious talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe date portion isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d</p><p>And with that he leaned down and kissed her. His lips on hers felt sweet. It was a soft kiss until her mouth opened under his and she moved into him. She sighed when his tongue swept inside and rubbed against hers. His touch was electrifying.</p><p>And that was only the beginning.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her up against him as his mouth slanted over hers again and again.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you taste good.\u201d His voice was raspy. He kissed the side of her neck and felt her shiver.</p><p>She put her arms around his neck and her fingers tugged on his hair to get him to kiss her again. She had wondered what it would feel like to be kissed by him, but no fantasy could match the reality. He overwhelmed her, and it was wonderful. He kissed her again, a hot, wet, openmouthed kiss that made her want much, much more, and when he pulled back she felt dazed.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stay or leave?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She kissed the pulse at the base of his neck. \u201cI guess I can try casual,\u201d she whispered, shocked by how ragged her own voice sounded.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, if I stay, it isn\u2019t gonna be casual.\u201d</p><p>He tilted her chin up with his thumb, needing to see her eyes and hear her say the words before he started tearing his clothes off and then hers.</p><p>His cell phone rang a scant second before Ellie\u2019s phone beeped.</p><p>Max took a deep breath, then reluctantly pulled away from her to answer the call. Ellie found her phone in her purse and read the text.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d he said into his phone. He ended the call and looked up to see Ellie opening the door.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a shooting at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>At the same time she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been called in to surgery.\u201d</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>Ellie thought she should drive herself to the hospital, but Max disagreed. He wasn\u2019t going to let her out of his sight until he knew what in thunder was going on. Ignoring her protests, he grabbed her keys, locked the dead bolts, and pulled her along to his car.</p><p>\u201cI could be in surgery all night,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait and drive you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that could be hours...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>She stopped arguing. The set of his jaw indicated he was going to be stubborn. She gave him directions to a shortcut crossing over the highway, and then she called Wendy, the ER nurse, to find out what she was going to be walking into.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s another pileup on I-70,\u201d Wendy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got mangled bodies on their way in. Dr. Westfield wants you here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d she said. \u201cI heard there was a shooting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there was, and right inside the emergency room doors. Gangs are becoming more accommodating. They\u2019re shooting each other right where they know they can get help. Pretty soon they\u2019ll be shooting it out in front of the OR doors. Cuts out the middleman, you know-the ambulance driver, the paramedic. I\u2019m telling you, Ellie, it\u2019s a war zone in the ER now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><p>She disconnected the call and turned to Max to repeat what Wendy had told her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little surprising it hasn\u2019t happened before now,\u201d she said. \u201cEven with security, the number of weapons confiscated from gangs when they\u2019re brought into the hospital is shocking. It was only a matter of time before one of those weapons was overlooked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hospital should spring for more security. Triple it,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly way to control it.\u201d</p><p>She agreed. \u201cWho called you about the shooting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was at the hospital this late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was heading back to check on Sean when he heard there were shots in the hospital. He should be there by now. We need to find out what\u2019s going on, to make sure Sean wasn\u2019t the target. We\u2019ve got an agent watching out for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the Landrys would send someone to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter safe than sorry.\u201d</p><p>Max took the entrance to the hospital on two wheels and screeched to a stop near the emergency room doors.</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t find me on the surgical floor, look in Sean\u2019s room,\u201d he told her.</p><p>The emergency room looked like a set for a disaster movie. Each bay was packed. Doctors and nurses rushed from one to the other tending to victims of the highway accident. Mixed in among them were a few gang members, some handcuffed to their gurneys, also waiting to be treated for their wounds. Policemen were stationed around the area.</p><p>Most of the accident victims were dazed and quiet, but the gang members were not so compliant. Some were screaming for drugs while others shouted obscenities and threats because they weren\u2019t getting priority attention. It was loud and chaotic.</p><p>Ben was waiting just inside the doors. \u201cIt\u2019s bedlam in here.\u201d</p><p>He was right. They had to shout to be heard.</p><p>Ellie realized she was gripping her phone and didn\u2019t have her purse or a pocket to put it in. Without a thought as to what she was doing, she handed the phone to Max. He already had her keys. He might as well hold her phone, too.</p><p>Max and Ben stayed right behind her as she made her way around gurneys and supply carts.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Sean?\u201d Max asked immediately.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing okay. There\u2019s someone with him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the word on the shooting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve gathered, a rookie cop was watching the ER doors. A guy walked in, and when his jacket fell open, the cop spotted a gun in his pocket. The cop pulled his weapon and told the guy to hand over his gun, but he drew on him. The rookie had no choice but to fire, shot him in the chest. There were enough witnesses to prove it was self-defense. The doctors tried to resuscitate the shooter, but it was too late. The police claim there\u2019s a gang war going on.\u201d</p><p>Ellie heard him. \u201cIt seems there always is,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOne of the officers told me there was a real bloodbath tonight at some deserted warehouse. An ambush,\u201d he added. \u201cTwo dead, six injured. Most are thinking the shooter was here on a vendetta, but a couple of people I talked to said he didn\u2019t fit the gangbanger profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ID?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ben answered. \u201cProbably wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea for us to follow up on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t usually see this crowd until the middle of the night,\u201d Ellie remarked as she pushed a gurney aside so they could pass.</p><p>Max noticed that she was oblivious to the catcalls and the crude compliments shouted at her from various gurneys. One skinhead yelled something so obscene Max wanted to grab him by the neck, but Ellie didn\u2019t seem the least affected.</p><p>\u201cHey, wait up, Ellie,\u201d Ben said. \u201cYou passed the elevators.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking the stairs,\u201d Max told him.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, not comprehending why anyone would run up three flights when there were perfectly good elevators just steps away.</p><p>Max climbed the stairs ahead of them and opened the door on the fourth floor. With a parting nod, Ellie ran to the locker room to change into scrubs. A seventy-year-old man was waiting on the operating table for her. His car had been sandwiched between a semi and a moving van on the highway, and he had suffered a ruptured kidney. It would take her the next few hours to complete the partial nephrectomy.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see Max again until almost one in the morning. Just as he had said, he was in Sean\u2019s room. He was sprawled in a chair watching one of the news channels. The sound was so low she didn\u2019t know how he could hear it. Ben was there, too. He was sound asleep in a chair on the other side the bed. There was an agent sitting in a chair outside of Sean\u2019s door.</p><p>Ben woke up when she brushed past him. Startled, he jumped to his feet, realized where he was, and stepped back so Ellie could get to Sean.</p><p>Yawning, he whispered, \u201cGood night,\u201d and quietly left the room.</p><p>Ellie had already changed back into street clothes. Since she was in his room, she decided to check Sean\u2019s incision. She slipped on a pair of gloves and gently pulled the hospital gown down. Sean slept through her inspection. When she turned around, Max was waiting for her by the door. His hair was tousled, and she thought he looked incredibly sexy.</p><p>Can anyone be too tired for sex? She was dead on her feet, but she still wanted to jump his bones. Good thing he wasn\u2019t a mind reader.</p><p>As they walked down the corridor, he commented, \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night. How come you look so good?\u201d</p><p>She had glanced at herself in the mirror when she was changing, and she knew she looked like hell. \u201cYou need glasses.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>They took their time descending the stairs. Ellie was used to running everywhere, but she didn\u2019t mind the slow pace. In fact, she fought the urge to lean into him.</p><p>\u201cSo what happens now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI take you home,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cI mean with the Landry case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow-or rather, today-after you\u2019ve had some sleep, you\u2019ll need to go to the police station and look at some photos. Agent Hughes will be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen and I will be doing some paperwork, and then we fly back to Honolulu.\u201d</p><p>All thoughts of tearing his clothes off and having mind-blowing sex came to a screeching halt. It would have been an amazing night, she knew, but it would have been just one night. Recreational sex came with a price... especially for her. She wasn\u2019t the sophisticated and experienced sort who could have sex with a man and forget about him the next morning. Max was leaving for good, and she would never see him again, so it would be best if they said their good-byes and went their separate ways. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Decision made, she relaxed.</p><p>Max\u2019s cell phone rang.

A police officer requested some help with a kid, and I suggested you. Mind stopping by?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, all right.\u201d</p><p>As Ellie and Max cut through the emergency room area, they noticed how quiet it was compared with the earlier scene. The hallways were empty, and they didn\u2019t have to zigzag around the gurneys.</p><p>Then they turned the corner and spotted Ben. He stood in front of a door with his arms folded, blocking access. A young policeman, a middle-aged man, and a hospital aide were standing in front of him arguing. The aide had a set of keys and wanted Ben to move so he could unlock the door. Ben wasn\u2019t budging.</p><p>\u201cGet out of the way and I\u2019ll just shoot the lock,\u201d the older man suggested. He pulled a small handgun from his pocket. \u201cMove out of my way. I\u2019ll-\u201d</p><p>Ben reacted with lightning speed. Before the man could blink, he\u2019d confiscated the gun. He handed it to the officer.</p> <p>The policeman glared at the man. \u201cHow did you get in the hospital with that gun, Gorman? And what are you doing with it anyway? You\u2019re a social worker-and a damned poor one at that. You should find another line of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a permit to carry,\u201d Gorman boasted. \u201cI work in a bad part of town. I need protection. Now give me my gun back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecurity here sucks,\u201d the officer muttered to Ben.</p><p>\u201cI want to see your permit,\u201d Ben demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in my glove compartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u2019 Max asked.</p> <p>Ben nodded to the social worker and said, \u201cThings got out of hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Ellie knew all about Gorman. He was mean and liked to throw his weight around.</p><p>Gorman started to explain, but Max put his hand up, nodded to the officer, and said, \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA boy was being dragged out of the ER by Gorman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a social worker. I have every right-\u201d Gorman began. He quickly shut his mouth when he saw Max\u2019s dark expression.</p><p>Max read the officer\u2019s name and said, \u201cGo on, Officer Lane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boy was screaming while Gorman dragged him,\u201d he said again. \u201cThe aide,\u201d he continued with a nod toward the young man holding the keys, \u201chad the boy\u2019s other arm. They were hurting him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was using necessary force,\u201d Gorman defended.</p><p>\u201cHe told me to grab him,\u201d the aide said.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d the officer said in a loud voice to get the others to be quiet, \u201cthe boy broke free. He ran through an open exam room where a doctor was sewing up a patient, and he got hold of a scalpel. He locked himself in this private exam room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is this boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine or ten.\u201d</p><p>Jeez. \u201cAnd you want to pull a gun on him?\u201d Max quietly asked the social worker.</p><p>Gorman shrank at the anger in Max\u2019s eyes. He took a step back and decided to bluster his way through the situation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting this boy in lockup. Resisting and fighting me...\u201d</p><p>Turning to the aide, Max said, \u201cUnlock the door and don\u2019t leave. You and I aren\u2019t finished.\u201d</p><p>The aide\u2019s hands shook as he tried three keys before finally opening the door. He hastily stepped away.</p><p>\u201cOfficer Lane, escort these two men into the waiting room and wait for me,\u201d Max ordered. He turned to Ellie. \u201cI won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>He entered the room and quietly shut the door behind him.</p><p>Ellie went to the nurse\u2019s station to find out who the boy belonged to. She knew the nurse on duty. Her name was Mary, and she was a sweet older woman who was on a perpetual diet.</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell me about-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sweet boy Gorman terrorized?\u201d</p><p>Ellie nodded. Mary moved closer to the counter so she wouldn\u2019t be overheard.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who called social services. The boy and his brother were in a car accident. The older brother just got out of surgery. Broken leg,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe little guy has some cuts, but he checked out all right. He said his aunt is coming to get him, but she won\u2019t be here until tomorrow. That\u2019s all he would say. Then Gorman came charging in. I thought about calling security, but then Officer Lane came on duty and he helped.\u201d</p><p>Ben joined Ellie at the counter. He could see she was becoming anxious. She kept glancing at the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cMax knows what he\u2019s doing. A nine-year-old with a scalpel won\u2019t be a problem for him. He\u2019s gone into much trickier situations.\u201d</p><p>That news didn\u2019t comfort her. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you or Officer Lane go in? Why did you ask Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s better at this sort of crisis than I am. He knows what\u2019s going on inside that boy\u2019s head. Max can help him, and pretty soon the boy will know he can trust him.\u201d He went on, \u201cThere was this case about a year ago. An uncle was using his nephew as a punching bag, and one day the kid had had enough. He got hold of his uncle\u2019s gun and was going to kill him. The two of them were locked in the boy\u2019s bedroom. I remember the walls were green, and there were posters of superheroes all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a standoff, and the boy held the uncle at gunpoint. It took some convincing for the boy to let Max come in. He found out that the uncle had tried to sexually assault the boy, and that was when the boy went for the gun. Max understood that the boy wanted his uncle to suffer, and so he described in detail what was going to happen to the uncle when he was sent to prison. It was pretty gross stuff, but it placated the boy, and he gave Max the gun.</p><p>\u201cThe uncle started screaming at the kid then, so Max walked over and coldcocked him. By the time I was there putting the cuffs on him, the pervert had come around and was blubbering. I guess what Max had told the kid scared him. The prick,\u201d he added, almost as an afterthought.</p><p>\u201cWhat if that boy had turned the gun on Max?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe was prepared for that. He knows how to handle these situations.\u201d</p><p>Ellie kept watching the closed door. \u201cScalpels are sharp,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the boy slashes an artery or-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax won\u2019t let him hurt him.\u201d</p><p>And he was right. The door opened and Max walked out. He had one hand on the shoulder of the little boy, who was glued to his side, and he held the scalpel in his other hand.</p><p>The boy seemed too little to be nine or ten, Ellie thought, and he looked so scared. She wanted to find Gorman and sock him. As she walked toward them, the child\u2019s eyes got big and he shuffled to get behind Max.</p><p>Max looked down and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. She\u2019s with me. Let\u2019s let her look at your arms, okay? Then we\u2019ll find you some food and a bed. You\u2019re staying here tonight.\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s name was Kyle, and both of his arms had red streaks from being wrenched. Max lifted him onto an exam table.</p><p>When Kyle saw Ellie putting on gloves, he said, \u201cNo shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shots,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI just want to examine you.\u201d</p><p>She helped him remove his T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cThe other doctor said the seat belt saved me,\u201d Kyle whispered. \u201cSee? There\u2019s the bruise where it held me. I was in the backseat.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was more interested in his left shoulder and his arms. The skin was red and inflamed from his wrist to his elbows, and the left wrist was sprained. The right arm wasn\u2019t as bad.</p><p>\u201cWhere are your parents, Kyle?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cMy mom died, and I don\u2019t know my dad,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cAny other family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my brother. I live with him. My aunt lives in Chicago, and she said she\u2019ll come tomorrow and get me.\u201d</p><p>Ellie looked at Max. \u201cI\u2019m going to admit him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Kyle asked with a frantic look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt means you\u2019re going to sleep here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen your brother gets out of recovery, I\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s on the same floor. All right?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about that man? He said he was going to put me in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of him, like I promised,\u201d Max said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I took that knife. I thought they\u2019d leave me alone if I could scare them.\u201d</p><p>Ellie went back to the nurse\u2019s station to start the admission process. She called the office and explained that an aide employed by the hospital had inflicted some of the injury to the child and that there was a possibility of a lawsuit. Since she was the admitting physician, she would determine when the child could be released. By the time the paperwork was completed, Kyle was sound asleep.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bad sprain in his wrist,\u201d she told Max. \u201cI\u2019m surprised Gorman didn\u2019t pull his arm out of the socket. He\u2019ll need ice packs on the shoulder, too.\u201d</p><p>She waited at the nurse\u2019s station while Max and Ben went into the waiting room to talk to Gorman and the aide.</p><p>She heard Officer Lane say in a raised voice, \u201cYou have the right to remain silent...\u201d She couldn\u2019t hear the rest because Gorman was shouting.</p><p>A minute later Max returned to her. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>She turned back to the nurse. \u201cThanks, Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know the night crew on three. They\u2019ll watch out for that boy,\u201d Mary assured.</p><p>Nodding, Ellie followed Max out into the night air. Ben called good night as he headed to his car.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get Kyle to calm down?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything. I just let him talk. The poor kid was scared out of his mind. When he was ready to listen to me, I promised him no one was going to lock him up and that I would keep that social worker away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe obviously believed you. You were good with him.\u201d</p><p>They reached the car, and Max opened the door. \u201cYou\u2019ll check on him in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will, and I\u2019ll make sure someone stays with him until his aunt arrives. You don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you looking out for him, I won\u2019t worry at all.\u201d</p><p>Ellie slipped into the passenger seat, clipped on the seat belt, and closed her eyes. They hadn\u2019t even pulled out of the parking lot before she was asleep. Had Max not been watching, he wouldn\u2019t have believed it. Her deep, even breathing indicated she had drifted off into a sound slumber. As he drove, he thought about her. She was a woman who was used to being in control, and yet she felt comfortable with him. She wouldn\u2019t have let herself sleep if she didn\u2019t feel safe.</p><p>He remembered the route she had shown him, and it didn\u2019t take any time at all to get her home. He parked the car in front of her building, turned the motor off, then unhooked his seat belt and hers.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetheart. You need to get to bed.\u201d</p><p>The second he touched her arm she was alert. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to walk in with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>When he opened her car door, he took her hand.</p><p>Neither one of them said another word until they were inside her apartment. He did a quick check, pulled her phone out of his pocket, and handed it to her. Then he bent down and kissed her. She leaned into him and that was all the permission he needed. He wrapped his arms around her and deepened the kiss. She followed his lead and used her tongue to drive him as wild as he was driving her.</p><p>What was the harm in a few kisses... farewell kisses... she thought, as her arms curled around his neck.</p><p>Max pulled back, looked into her eyes, and with a low growl kissed her again. He loved the taste of her, like sugar and mint, and the feel of her soft, luscious body pressed against him. Most of all he loved the way she responded to him.</p><p>How could he resist her? The kiss was hot, wet, thoroughly arousing, and when Max realized it was getting out of control and he didn\u2019t want to stop, he forced himself to end it. He couldn\u2019t seem to let go of her, though. Holding her tight, he took a couple of deep, shaky breaths, trying to regain some semblance of control. He knew he shouldn\u2019t have started this. He should let go of her and walk out the door. Yeah, that\u2019s what he should do. Ellie wasn\u2019t the one-night-only kind of girl. She wasn\u2019t a hookup or a throwaway, as some of the guys in the office called their one-night stands.</p><p>Let go and walk out the door. He silently chanted the command and still didn\u2019t move. How could he? Ellie was kissing the pulse at the base of his neck, making his heart rate accelerate. She kissed the side of his neck, then moved up to his ear. Her mouth was soft against his skin, and her tongue was driving him nuts.</p><p>He tightened his hold on her. \u201cWe need to stop this,\u201d he began, realizing his words contradicted his actions, since he couldn\u2019t make himself let go.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered, kissing him again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to Honolulu, and I don\u2019t want to...\u201d He was losing his train of thought, and all he could think about was kissing her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to what?\u201d she asked. Her fingers splayed into his hair as she leaned up to kiss his jaw.</p><p>He had to think about the question for several seconds, then said, \u201cHurt you. Yeah, that\u2019s it. Sex tonight, gone tomorrow, I don\u2019t think you could handle that.\u201d</p><p>The truth was, he wasn\u2019t sure he could handle it either. Ellie was going to be real hard to walk away from, almost impossible. He didn\u2019t question why he felt that way, just knew it in his heart. She was so different from the other women he had known. She wouldn\u2019t be forgettable.</p><p>\u201cEllie, it would be easy for me to get you into bed...,\u201d he began.</p><p>Easy? She felt her spine stiffen. How egotistical! A couple of seconds passed before honesty kicked in. He was telling the truth. It would be easy for him, but it would be just as easy for her to get him into bed. And hadn\u2019t she decided that was a bad idea?</p><p>Her lips brushed his jaw when she said, \u201cAnd I\u2019d end up getting hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice shook. \u201cI think you would.\u201d</p><p>Ellie pulled away. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cYou need a more experienced woman, someone who knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d God, he was arrogant, but oh was he sexy. It took all she had not to throw herself into his arms again, but instead, she opened the door. \u201cHave a nice flight home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>NINE</p><p>Ben surprised Ellie early Sunday afternoon when he knocked on her door and told her he would drive her to the police station to look at some photos. If he had arrived fifteen minutes later, he would have missed her. Dressed casually in jeans, a white T-shirt, and tennis shoes, Ellie was throwing her phone into her purse with her lipstick, brush, wallet, latex gloves-she had learned never to be without them-a pack of tissues, and a small plastic bottle of disinfectant. She never left home without that item either.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask Ben where Max was, but he volunteered the information anyway. \u201cRob-that would be Agent Hughes,\u201d he explained, \u201cwanted Max\u2019s help interviewing another possible witness. A young man was cutting through the park and says he saw the Landrys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can identify them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Ben said, unwilling to say more.</p><p>\u201cSo he won\u2019t be at the station?\u201d she asked as she slid into the passenger seat of Ben\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cWho? Max? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant Agent Hughes,\u201d she explained. \u201cI thought he wanted to be there when I looked at the photos.\u201d</p><p>Ben shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s so anxious for you to identify the Landrys, it\u2019s been suggested that he might inadvertently steer you toward those photos, so he\u2019s going to stay away.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Wahlberg will be there to observe,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s local.\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s cell phone rang. She looked at the screen and said, \u201cExcuse me. It\u2019s the hospital.\u201d After a brief conversation, she put the phone back in her purse. \u201cI just dismissed Kyle. His aunt is there to pick him up. He\u2019ll be staying with her,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Ben said. \u201cI\u2019d hate to think he\u2019d have to deal with another Gorman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a typical social worker. Most are very competent and understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully, Gorman\u2019s replacement will be more compassionate.\u201d</p><p>A few blocks later Ellie said, \u201cTell me about the Landrys.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re a piece of...\u201d He didn\u2019t finish the sentence, although he thought of several choice words he could have used to describe the pair. \u201cThey started out in Omaha,\u201d he began. \u201cThat\u2019s where they lived until about five years ago.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck as he added, \u201cThey sell weapons to anyone who can pay. Untraceable weapons. They started small-handguns, every make and model, then moved up to semiautomatic, then moved up again...\u201d</p><p>He pulled onto the highway and cut over to the center lane. \u201cThere are guns on the street now with bullets that can cut through steel. Bulletproof vests don\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve seen the damage they can do. We call them spinners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other surgeons and I,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bullets spin around inside the body, shredding arteries and organs. Last winter I tried to repair the damage one did to a ten-year-old boy. His mother told me he was walking across the street when the shooting started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he make it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he was gone before we could get it out. I promised his mother I would never forget him, and I won\u2019t. He was such a beautiful little boy. His name was Joel Watkins.\u201d She turned to look out the side window as she said, \u201cI know the Landrys didn\u2019t sell that specific gun to the man who killed Joel, but to me they\u2019re just as responsible. Anyone who puts guns on the street should be held accountable for every death.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t disagree. \u201cThere are hundreds of other dealers, but the Landrys... well, they\u2019re going to get a special place in hell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThey moved to Honolulu a couple of years ago when they got into bigger and better weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey must have had something very big going on to bring them all the way here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, the men they were meeting were killed in the park. It would have been nice if we could have turned one of them.\u201d</p><p>They reached the station, and Ben found a parking spot in the lot around the corner.</p><p>Ellie followed him through a set of double doors and asked, \u201cHow long do you think it will take before you catch them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to say, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll eventually show up. If not here, then in Honolulu. They\u2019re used to getting pulled in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019ll see what evidence you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd witnesses.\u201d</p><p>She felt a shiver. She had been warned how they worked. Witnesses disappeared, and if there was no clear evidence to indict them, the Landrys went back to business as usual.</p><p>Agent Wahlberg was waiting for them at the front desk and escorted them up to the second floor to a long, spacious room. The walls were industrial beige, and the desks were all but on top of one another. Every desk had a computer monitor on it and a chair sitting adjacent to it. Most of them were empty, but it was Sunday and still early in the day. Tonight, she guessed, would be another story if the station was anything like the ER.</p><p>Ellie passed a large, slouch-shouldered Hispanic man wearing a tank top and jeans. He was handcuffed to his chair and sat next to a detective who was typing a report into his computer. She noticed a woman and a little boy anxiously watching the proceedings from a bench across the room and assumed they were related. The man\u2019s head was bent as he grumbled answers to the detective\u2019s questions.</p><p>Ellie walked by the man and paused momentarily. She also noticed something else, backtracked to get a better look, then continued on to the back of the room where Wahlberg and Ben waited. Wahlberg courteously pulled a chair out while Ben placed two binders on the desk in front of her. He opened one to a page of mug shots. After getting instructions from Wahlberg, Ellie proceeded to study the faces on each page.</p><p>Every few minutes she looked up to see what was happening with the man sitting with the detective. There wasn\u2019t any question what she had to do. When she saw the detective unlock the handcuffs, she pushed her chair back, stood, and said, \u201cExcuse me a minute.\u201d</p><p>Ben started to follow her, but she raised her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing?\u201d Wahlberg asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ben replied.</p><p>Ellie didn\u2019t have any idea how the man would react, but it was her responsibility to talk to him.</p><p>\u201cThis is your lucky day, Carlos Garcia,\u201d the detective was saying as she approached. \u201cI\u2019m gonna let you go, but I won\u2019t be so lenient next time.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Carlos stood, so did his wife and child. Ellie walked around the desk to face the man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to have a word with you in private.\u201d</p><p>Carlos looked wary at first, then angry at the request. The detective stood and asked, \u201cWhat do you need with him? Maybe I could help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. She thrust her hand out to Carlos, all but grabbing his to shake it.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked, glancing at his wife and then back to her. \u201cDid I do something to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she assured him. \u201cWould you mind following me? It will only take a minute.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for his response but walked toward the corner of the room. Carlos followed.</p><p>\u201cLook, lady, I don\u2019t know what you think-\u201d</p><p>She interrupted. \u201cMy name is Dr. Sullivan,\u201d she began.</p><p>And that was all the detective who had been working with Carlos heard. The rest of the conversation was spoken in such a low voice he couldn\u2019t catch a word. A few moments later Carlos called his wife over, and she was included in the conversation. She nodded as she listened to what Ellie was saying, looking more and more worried.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d Wahlberg asked the question again.</p><p>Ben shrugged. He watched Ellie lean over the desk, grab a piece of paper, and write on it before handing it to Carlos.</p><p>Ellie put her hand on Carlos\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to cost you anything. I promise. The doctor owes me. Just promise me you\u2019ll go soon. I\u2019ll make sure he works you in. My cell phone number is on the bottom,\u201d she added, looking at his wife. \u201cIf there is any problem, you call me.\u201d</p><p>Both Carlos and his wife shook her hand. Ellie even shook the little boy\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cOkay then,\u201d Ben heard her say as she walked back to him.</p><p>Without a word of explanation, she resumed her inspection of the photos.</p><p>\u201cEllie?\u201d</p><p>She looked up. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know that man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she replied as she turned the page.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you talk to him?\u201d Wahlberg wondered.</p><p>\u201cI needed to,\u201d she answered, but she didn\u2019t say another word about the matter.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to explain that, as she walked past Carlos, she had noticed the mole on the back of his neck and, upon closer inspection, was 95 percent certain it was a melanoma. It needed to be checked as soon as possible.</p><p>Carlos\u2019s wife had told Ellie she, too, had noticed it, and that she was sure it hadn\u2019t been there long. That was a good sign. Hopefully, if it was melanoma, it would be caught before it spread throughout the body. Ellie wanted her diagnosis to be wrong, but she doubted it was.</p><p>Both agents let the matter drop. Ben pulled up a chair and began to answer some texts as he waited.</p><p>Ellie turned a page and continued to examine the pictures of some of the homeliest and most terrifying men and women she\u2019d ever seen. And that was saying something considering the number of gangbangers she\u2019d put back together.</p><p>Her phone beeped that she had a text, and she paused to respond to it. When she was finished, she turned to Ben. \u201cYour wife says hello.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWhat\u2019s she worried about today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiet,\u201d she answered. \u201cAnd just for the record, I like hearing from her, so don\u2019t tease her when you get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he promised.</p><p>Ellie turned back to the photos.</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s here,\u201d Wahlberg said. \u201cI knew Hughes couldn\u2019t stay away. And that must be the guy who was in the park and says he saw the Landrys.\u201d</p><p>She looked up to see two men coming toward her. The one leading the way appeared to be in his early forties, but his hair was prematurely gray and his face was creased with deep frown lines that suggested he was not used to smiling often. He carried himself with authority, so she suspected he was Hughes, the agent she\u2019d been warned about. With him was a younger man with a lanky build. His long hair was combed forward, concealing his forehead and nearly covering his eyes. And right behind them was Max.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat. Damn it, she thought she wouldn\u2019t see him after last night. Now she had to go through the angst again?</p><p>Oh no, she wouldn\u2019t, she decided. She would choose not to be affected by him.</p><p>Great plan, lousy follow-through. Her stupid heart was racing by the time he reached her. It didn\u2019t help that he was dressed in a pair of jeans and a gray T-shirt that showed off the muscles in his chest and upper arms.</p><p>Stop noticing, she told herself. She said hello and quickly returned to the mug shots. She would rather have stared at Max, but then who wouldn\u2019t? Ignore him, her better judgment told her. That was the key to averting a heart attack. A heart attack? The possibility of such a thing happening was so absurd she couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smiling about?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cThese lovely photos.\u201d</p><p>Agent Hughes came around the desk to face her. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been introduced,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t get up,\u201d he added as he extended his hand.</p><p>He was a polite but extremely stiff man, Ellie decided. The job showed on his face, but he seemed pleasant enough and not as overbearing as Max had suggested.</p><p>\u201cHave you looked through that book yet? Did you really examine each picture?\u201d Hughes asked her.</p><p>\u201cShe just got started,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cYou should probably back off,\u201d Max added with some irritation in his tone. \u201cLet her look at the mug shots without any pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntroduce me to the lady,\u201d the young man standing next to Max requested. \u201cMy name\u2019s Greg,\u201d he said as his eyes scanned her body from head to toe.</p><p>She started to say, \u201cEllie,\u201d but Max was quicker. \u201cShe\u2019s Dr. Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of a doctor are you?\u201d Greg asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go sit at that desk over there and start looking through the binder,\u201d Max suggested. He stood directly behind Ellie and casually placed his hands on her shoulders. \u201cOr you could look at the photos on the computer. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what she\u2019s doing,\u201d Greg said. \u201cIn fact, why don\u2019t I sit next to her, and we can go through the pictures together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how this is gonna work,\u201d Max said. \u201cGo sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, have you looked through this entire binder?\u201d Hughes asked. And before she could answer, he said, \u201cMaybe you ought to start over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go sit with Greg,\u201d Ben said, \u201cand let Ellie look without any prodding.\u201d</p><p>Hughes raised a hand. \u201cOkay, okay. Just make sure she-\u201d \u201cEnough already,\u201d Max snapped.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell her what page the Landrys are on?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>Hughes shook his head and crossed the room to get some coffee but turned back to say, \u201cMaybe we should just put six or seven photos on the table like we usually do... maybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t change the set now. Let her look.\u201d</p><p>Ellie felt as though she were in the middle of some macho competition. Hughes\u2019s demeanor had become so intense, she was glad he was going to give her some space, but she did start over on the first page. She paused halfway through and tapped a photo. \u201cI remember him. He came through the OR last year. Switchblade nicked the lateral thoracic artery. It was a tough surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t nicks in arteries bleed out quickly?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cNot when the surgeon has her finger on it holding it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did that?\u201d</p><p>She nodded as she studied more faces. Three pages later she tapped another photo. \u201cTwo bullets in the stomach. Horrible recovery.\u201d</p><p>And on it went. Twice more she pointed to photos and described the surgeries.</p><p>Max leaned against the desk. He watched her look at both Cal and Erika Landry\u2019s photos, which Hughes had inserted among the other mug shots, and there was absolutely no recognition on her part. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He went to Hughes and gave him the bad news, that Ellie hadn\u2019t been able to identify the Landrys.</p><p>Hughes couldn\u2019t hide his disappointment. \u201cHave her look again,\u201d he insisted. \u201cMaybe she was distracted when she-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone through them twice now. She\u2019s not gonna be a witness, so she doesn\u2019t go on the list.\u201d</p><p>Ellie wasn\u2019t paying any attention to the raised voices. She received two texts back to back. She read the first and decided to ignore it, but the second text was more insistent. Dr. Westfield wanted to make a deal. If she would come in and do a colon resection for him, he would let today be her last day at the hospital. The offer was too good to resist. Since Westfield didn\u2019t need her in the OR until five o\u2019clock and the patient was stable, she texted to say she would do it.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, Ellie, you\u2019re done here,\u201d Agent Hughes reluctantly told her.</p><p>She stood, slipped her phone into her purse and, trying to ignore Max, said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>She turned to leave but stopped, realizing she hadn\u2019t driven her car to the station.</p><p>\u201cI need a ride home.\u201d</p><p>Every man in the room immediately offered to take her. Greg was the most vocal and leapt to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you, and maybe we could stop for lunch.\u201d</p> <p>Max shoved him back in the chair. \u201cShe\u2019s not going anywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>Ben was intrigued by Max\u2019s behavior. He apparently had decided he didn\u2019t like or trust Greg, and that didn\u2019t make any sense at all. Then he noticed the way Max was looking at Ellie. Ah, now he understood. Damn, he was slow today. He should have picked up on the signal much earlier. He stood and fished the keys out of his pocket and started toward Ellie, but Max stopped him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got this,\u201d Max muttered. He took Ellie\u2019s arm and practically pulled her across the room toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Ellie whispered so only he could hear.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne minute you\u2019re this aloof federal agent, and the next you\u2019re Neanderthal man.\u201d</p> <p>He flashed a smile. \u201cI just want to get you out of here before Hughes shoves the Landry photos in your face.\u201d</p><p>Once they were in his car and on their way, she said, \u201cMaybe Greg will be able to identify the Landrys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe. He says he got a good look at Cal before he put on the sunglasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell him witnesses have a way of disappearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHughes will talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen does your flight leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a day or two. It depends on how much we need to do here.\u201d</p><p>She hated that she was going to have to say good-bye again. No kisses this time, she vowed, and no angst.</p> <p>\u201cI forgot to say good-bye to Ben,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him. Listen, Ellie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not forgetting about Evan Patterson. I will find him, and as soon as I do, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s back in a mental ward somewhere,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m checking,\u201d he promised.</p><p>He pulled up to her building.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going inside,\u201d she told him as she unhooked her seat belt. She fished her car keys from her purse and got out before he turned off the motor.</p><p>\u201cYou be careful,\u201d she said in farewell. She was able to stop herself before she added, \u201cChasing bad guys.\u201d How lame would that have been?</p><p>He didn\u2019t say good-bye to her. At least she didn\u2019t think he did, but then she practically dived into her car and drove away. She forced herself not to look in the rearview mirror, and after she\u2019d turned the corner, she sighed. Not too awkward, she decided. But in the back of her mind an unwanted thought nagged at her. She should have slept with him.</p><p>TEN</p><p>Greg Roper was a dream come true. Agent Hughes was overjoyed to have found such a strong witness to testify against the Landrys. The twenty-six-year-old had come forward the day after the shooting and had told Hughes he had seen both Cal and Erika Landry in the park.</p><p>When Hughes met Roper at the police station to look at the photos Sunday afternoon, the agent had his suspicions that Roper was a bit of a flake because of the way he kept hitting on Ellie Sullivan, but as soon as she left the station, Roper got down to business and quickly pointed out the suspects.</p><p>As far as Hughes was concerned, Roper was an ideal witness. He had never had any trouble with the police, had never even gotten a speeding ticket, and he had held down a good job for more than four years. Most important to Hughes was the fact that Roper wasn\u2019t at all ambivalent about what he saw. He explained that he was crossing the park and was taking a shortcut through a thicket of shrubbery to get to his car when he saw Erika Landry. She was sitting in the passenger seat of a big Mercedes that was driving slowly down the street.</p><p>\u201cWhat was she doing?\u201d Hughes asked.</p><p>\u201cShe pulled down the visor to look at herself in the mirror, and then she tugged on her hair, and it all moved at once. It was a wig, and I think she was trying to fix the thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Cal Landry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see his face yet, but when he parked the car at the end of the block and got out, I saw him. He stood there surveying the street, but he turned as he was bringing up his sunglasses. I was close enough to see the scar on his cheek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stay where you were? Why didn\u2019t you keep going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was curious. At first I thought maybe the woman was going through chemo or something and didn\u2019t have any hair, but when she adjusted the wig, her long red hair fell loose, and she pushed it back in. She had pretty red hair. Why was she hiding it under a wig? Then I saw the man reach into his pocket and look down at something, like he was checking on it. I couldn\u2019t see what it was, but it made me even more curious. I could tell they were up to something, and I had time, so I decided to follow them and see what it was. I guess you could say I was being nosy. They didn\u2019t know I was there. They walked into the area of the park where the trees are pretty dense, and then suddenly they turned around and started walking really fast in the opposite direction. That\u2019s when I saw the FBI agent running after them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see Landry shoot Agent Goodman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure did. I saw him fire his gun in that direction where the agent was, and I saw the agent drop down, so, yes, I saw him shoot him.\u201d</p><p>Roper insisted that the Landrys never saw him. \u201cNever even looked my way, but the bushes hid me. I don\u2019t think they would have seen me if they had looked.\u201d</p><p>Hughes suggested strongly that Roper not discuss what he had seen with his family or friends.</p><p>There was a BOLO on the Landrys, but Hughes fully expected the couple to appear at a police station somewhere with their attorneys flanking them. They\u2019d say they\u2019d heard the feds were looking for them. Even though they\u2019d accuse the FBI of harassment, they\u2019d cooperate and answer questions. They might even admit they were in the park, but they\u2019d confess their innocence, and they\u2019d have a couple of witnesses to back them up.</p><p>Greg Roper was going to be their downfall... if Hughes could keep him alive long enough to testify.</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>Ellie drove directly to the hospital and was finished with her surgery by five thirty. She was walking out the door when she was called back in. A bus filled with teenagers returning to St. Louis from a football camp had been broadsided by a semi, and there were four life-threatening injuries. Ellie did two more surgeries and didn\u2019t get home until after three in the morning. She crawled into bed and slept twelve straight hours.</p><p>When she awoke, she felt restless and didn\u2019t want to be alone, which was a rare feeling for her. She decided to go to her home away from home. She called Uncle Oliver and Aunt Millie Wheatley, the dear people who had taken her in when she was twelve years old. They loved her, nurtured and protected her, and she suddenly missed them horribly.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as though she hadn\u2019t seen them in a while. She talked to them at least twice a week, sometimes more, and ate dinner at their house every other Sunday, depending on her schedule. But she had the sudden urge to spend some time with them before she left town.</p><p>Aunt Millie answered the phone when she called.</p><p>\u201cMay I spend the night?\u201d Ellie asked. What was wrong with her? She sounded so pathetic.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Millie answered. \u201cYour room is always ready for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in twenty.\u201d</p><p>Ellie immediately felt better. Just hearing the voice of someone who loved her made a difference.</p><p>An hour later she was sitting in the Wheatley kitchen, drinking hot tea. Uncle Oliver wanted to know about her latest surgeries and, of course, wanted the details about the incident outside the hospital. She talked about the surgery but didn\u2019t tell him she had seen the shooting. If he knew that she had been so close to the gunshots, he would have been very upset.</p><p>When her uncle had gone to bed, she and Millie discussed the upcoming wedding in Winston Falls.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nervous about going home, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Millie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cYour father would know if that monster is back in town,\u201d she said, referring to Patterson.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. I\u2019m nervous about... them. I want to fit in the family...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right. Just don\u2019t push it,\u201d she suggested. She reached across the table and patted Ellie\u2019s hand.</p><p>Anxious to change the subject, Ellie blurted, \u201cI met someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Millie began to smile. \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d</p><p>Ellie told her about Max and what a bizarre reaction she\u2019d had when she met him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all wrong for me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s abrupt and gruff, and at times he can be downright rude. For a living, he carries a gun and chases bad guys. His life is the antithesis of mine. Definitely not the ideal man... and yet, there was instant attraction... almost animalistic,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI couldn\u2019t control it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it was with your uncle and me. Instant attraction. Want to know a secret? We\u2019re old now. He\u2019s balding. I\u2019ve gained twenty pounds and have more wrinkles than a weary bloodhound, but the attraction is still there, and it\u2019s just as strong. If you think you might have feelings for this man, don\u2019t fight them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lives in Honolulu.\u201d</p><p>Millie drummed her fingers on the table. \u201cHonolulu, huh?\u201d</p><p>Ellie nodded. \u201cA world away.\u201d</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>At first, Ellie was nervous about going home. Now she dreaded it.</p><p>She lay awake staring at the shadows that were cast on the wall by the streetlight outside her bedroom window. She had stayed up late talking to Millie, and now she couldn\u2019t get to sleep.</p><p>Her room was just as she had left it. Her favorite books were still lined up on the shelf above her desk. Her bed still had the light pink comforter. The bureau still had the colorful porcelain lamp that she and Millie had found at a flea market. And there were clothes in the closet that she hadn\u2019t worn in years but couldn\u2019t bring herself to discard. This room was her safe haven.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been that way at first. When she was brought to the Wheatleys all those years ago, she was terrified and uncertain of her future; but Oliver and Millie gave her what she needed most, a secure, loving environment and time to adjust. They opened up their home and their hearts to her, and she would never be able to repay them for their generosity and kindness. When she was in their house, she felt protected.</p><p>Winston Falls, however, would always be her real home. Her visits had been infrequent over the years, and she usually couldn\u2019t wait to get back to see her family. This time was different.</p><p>It had been almost eighteen months since her last trip to Winston Falls, and that had ended in disaster. She had brought her fianc\u00e9, John Noble, home to meet her parents and her sister Ava. They all seemed to like John very much-especially Ava-and everything was going well until the second day, the day that Ellie abruptly broke off her engagement and flew back to her apartment alone.</p><p>Her parents knew what had happened-they were in the living room when Ellie went upstairs and opened the wrong door-and they were duly horrified and mortified. Ava had insisted she never meant to hurt anyone, but it was too late for apologies.</p><p>Their mother didn\u2019t know what to do about the situation. After pacing about the house for several hours, she made the decision to never ever discuss the unpleasant event. Their father didn\u2019t want to be put in the position of having to take sides, so he decided to let his daughters work it out between them. He had a long talk with Ava and then let it go.</p><p>Ellie felt devastated and hurt, but by the time she was back and settled in her apartment again, she had forgiven her parents for not throwing Ava out of the house. Once she\u2019d calmed down, Ellie realized it was wrong of her to expect them to choose one daughter over another. She had great sympathy for them, especially her father. The poor man had put up with so much because of her. She once told him she knew that she was a perpetual thorn in his side almost from the day she was born, and he had a good laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou, young lady, make life so much more interesting,\u201d he\u2019d told her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t so certain about that. She knew he had his hands full with her. At age three, she was reading and doing simple math, and her vocabulary was more advanced than most adults. By age five, she was deemed a prodigy. With that realization came the responsibility for her father to protect her from being exploited. Because he was a professor in the math department at the local university, he was able to keep Ellie from being bored by scheduling individual sessions with other professors in history, sociology, English literature, anatomy, and any other subject that caught her interest.</p><p>Her parents tried to make Ellie\u2019s life as normal as possible, but it was difficult. She was only ten when she entered Sacred Heart High School. The social aspect of high school was difficult for her because she was so much younger than the other students, but the older boys especially looked out for her.</p><p>Her father believed he had done a fair job of helping her live a happy and somewhat normal life until Evan Patterson came along. Patterson turned their lives upside down and dragged them through hell.</p><p>From the moment he saw her at a summer camp for advanced science students, the seventeen-year-old Patterson became obsessed. She wasn\u2019t aware of his interest, though, until he began walking back and forth in front of her house. Shortly after that, she started to receive photos of him and love letters. When she showed them to her father, he grew concerned that a boy so much older than Ellie was showing interest. He called Evan\u2019s parents to voice his misgivings but was told that the boy was quiet and shy and, because he was a gifted student like Ellie, was probably showing only how much he admired her academic accomplishments. Despite their glowing praise for their son, Ellie\u2019s father wasn\u2019t pacified. He responded by asking two seniors to walk her to and from school. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The first time Patterson made personal contact with Ellie was during the lunch hour at her school. She had gone outside and was sitting on a bench near the fountain eating an apple. Patterson came out of nowhere. He told her he needed to talk to her because she hadn\u2019t responded to his letters. He seemed very agitated. Ellie tried not to let him see that she was afraid as she told him he should stop writing to her, but her rejection only made him angrier. When Patterson grabbed her, she screamed. A teacher monitoring the school yard immediately tried to stop him, but Patterson was big for his age and very strong. He knocked her to the ground and tried to drag Ellie away with him.</p><p>Help came from the most surprising person-Spike Bennett, or the town terror, as the nuns called him. He was a troublemaker and proud of it. Sacred Heart kept him as a student because his father had donated quite a bit of money and also because the sisters liked lost causes. They were determined to rehabilitate him, but they weren\u2019t having much success. He cursed and constantly got into fights, usually starting them just for the fun of it. But on that day, Spike became Ellie\u2019s hero. He tackled Patterson and got Ellie away from him. While Patterson was pummeling him, Spike was yelling for Ellie to run.</p><p>Ellie wouldn\u2019t leave. She threw herself on top of Patterson and hit him with her fists. Other students came running, and it took three big boys to hold Patterson down until the police arrived. Spike was taken to the hospital for stitches.</p><p>Since Patterson had never caused any trouble before, the judge was lenient. He ordered a psychiatric evaluation and mandatory therapy for six months. Ellie\u2019s father, however, wasn\u2019t satisfied. He went to the authorities and obtained a restraining order. The following week, Ellie\u2019s schedule changed and she left Sacred Heart to attend classes at the university, so Evan never had contact with her at school again, but her nightmare was only beginning.</p> <p>The restraining order did little good. Patterson continued to stalk her. His adoration turned into harassment, and his harassment turned into threats. Despite all the precautions her parents took to protect her, Ellie was still vulnerable, and Patterson found ways to get close enough to assault her. The authorities were able to bring him up on charges, but each time, his attorneys worked a deal to send him for help. Beyond the restraining order, the police were powerless to do much about him. Ellie\u2019s parents did everything they could to protect her, making sure she was never alone when she was away from home. But even that didn\u2019t help on the terrible day he finally got her away from her protectors and beat her to within an inch of her life.</p><p>Patterson was finally locked up, but her parents were advised that there was a strong possibility that he would be moved to a private mental institution-his parents would bear the costs-and he could gain his freedom much sooner. So Ellie\u2019s mother and father made the most difficult decision of their lives, to send their daughter away, to hide her from the maniac. A friend in the FBI helped them by finding the Wheatleys, who lived eight hundred miles away. Ellie\u2019s father was pleased because they were both teachers. They were good, loving people and a godsend for Ellie.</p><p>When Ellie was discharged from the hospital, her mother went with her to the Wheatleys and stayed until Ellie had regained some of her strength and had become comfortable with her new guardians. Over the next couple of years Ellie was allowed to come home for brief visits, but that happened only after her parents were assured that Patterson was not free. Although the cost of the flights was a financial burden, it was well worth having their daughter with them. Things changed dramatically, however, when Patterson was moved to yet another private institution and given weekend passes. That meant Ellie had to stay away.</p><p>Her father didn\u2019t want her to feel isolated from the family, and for several years he made it a point to talk to her every single day. So did her mother. Ava and Annie kept in contact by e-mail and text.</p><p>Eventually, life and education got in the way. Ellie chose trauma medicine as her vocation, which meant endless hours at the hospital. It wasn\u2019t possible to have long chats anymore. Just a quick hello, love you, and good-bye. For Ellie, that was enough.</p> <p>She loved her family and normally would jump at the chance to be with them again, but going home was going to feel different this time. After the debacle of her last visit, she didn\u2019t know what she would be facing. Would they expect her to be cheerful and excited to be celebrating the happiest day in her sister\u2019s life?</p><p>And what about Patterson? He was always in the back of her mind. Was he looking for her? Would he show up one day? Now that he had vanished, Ellie\u2019s fear was magnified. Where was he? And what was he planning?</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>Ellie called her parents to let them know she would be home Tuesday evening. Her father wanted to pick her up at the airport, but she insisted on renting a car so she wouldn\u2019t be dependent on anyone for rides. She didn\u2019t tell him she also wanted to be able to get away in a hurry if she needed to.</p><p>Because she was able to catch an earlier flight, she landed ahead of schedule and was in her rental car and on her way to Winston Falls shortly after noon. It was a pretty drive. Two-thirds of it was on a four-lane highway, and she made quick time. The rest of the trip was on a paved two-lane road that curved through the countryside. There were several steep turns as the road wound through the hills, and very few signs. On either side of the road were thick shrubs and trees, and in some spots wilting but still colorful wildflowers.</p><p>Ellie made sure her rental car had GPS because she didn\u2019t know the route all that well. Although she had been home many times, her father had done all the driving, and she really hadn\u2019t paid much attention to roads and turns.</p> <p>At times she felt as though she were driving through a forest. Branches from some of the trees reached over the road, blocking the sun. It was a bit eerie, she thought, and foreboding. She opened her window to let some fresh air in and immediately felt the thick humidity pour over her face. With it came the heavy smell of the earth and a tinge of claustrophobia. She recognized the side road that led to the waterfall and was tempted to turn off, but she quickly rejected the idea. As she recalled, the natural phenomenon that gave her town its name was about a half mile off the beaten path, and she would have to walk that distance to get to it. Maybe another day, she thought.</p><p>The town came into view, and the first sign she saw was the one pointing the way to the Winston Falls Hospital. A shiver caught her by surprise. The memory of that hospital was so vivid. After Patterson had finished with her and had left her for dead, she was taken there to be stabilized and then airlifted to a trauma center. It was a long time ago, but coming home brought it all back. Put it aside, she told herself.</p><p>Winston Falls was a typical Southern town. The wide, tree-lined streets oozed charm. She pulled off Main Street, went two blocks over, passed Sacred Heart High School, and turned down Birch Street, where her parents lived. Nearly all the houses in this older part of town had wide front porches, and the residents liked to relax outside in the late afternoons with their newspaper and their sweet tea. She remembered sitting on the painted wooden boards of the large wraparound porch of her own house, playing board games with her sisters.</p><p>A block away she spotted her home. The two-story house had recently been painted a pale yellow, and the front door and shutters were now black. Black wicker chairs sat on the porch, and their new red cushions matched the potted geraniums flanking each of the wide porch steps.</p><p>Her father must have been looking out the window because, as soon as she pulled into the driveway, he opened the front door and motioned to her, shouting, \u201cPark behind the garage, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>The paved area to the rear of the garage was originally intended as a basketball court, but her family often used it for parking when people came to visit. At the edge of the court were steps that led up to an apartment above the garage. It had been recently painted as well, and she noticed there were blinds in each of the upstairs windows now. Her parents had really spruced up the place, she thought.</p><p>She had barely turned off her car engine when her father came out the back door and down the steps. He opened his arms wide and she rushed into them. No matter how old she became, she would never grow tired of her father\u2019s bear hugs. When he finally let go, he took her by the shoulders and held her at arm\u2019s length.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? Did you have any trouble getting here?\u201d he asked anxiously.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Daddy,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>Southern girls grew up calling their fathers \u201cDaddy,\u201d and Ellie wasn\u2019t the exception, though occasionally the Midwestern influence kicked in and she\u2019d call him \u201cDad.\u201d</p><p>Ellie opened the car trunk, and her father lifted out her bag.</p><p>\u201cThis is light as a feather. Did you put anything inside?\u201d</p><p>She followed him into the house, and he set the bag in the back hall before going into the large country kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mom?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDoing some grocery shopping. She\u2019ll be home soon. We didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be here until late.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was glad it was just the two of them so they could talk.</p><p>\u201cHow about a nice glass of iced sweet tea?\u201d he asked, opening the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t like sweet tea,\u201d she admitted, feeling terribly disloyal to her Southern heritage. \u201cI\u2019ll make some plain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, your mother made both.\u201d</p><p>Ellie got the glasses out and filled them with ice while her father poured the tea. She took a drink of hers and grimaced. They switched glasses, and she headed to the living room.</p><p>\u201cWant to sit on the porch?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d he said a little too quickly. \u201cLet\u2019s sit inside. It\u2019s cooler in here.\u201d</p><p>She understood his motives. \u201cBut we could sit outside after it gets dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we could if you want to. It will be cooler then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it would be more difficult for anyone walking past to see us, right? Or, rather, see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Ellie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I don\u2019t want to hide inside this house all the while I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want you to be cautious. Your mother worries.\u201d</p><p>He walked to the bay window overlooking the front yard and the street beyond and stood there staring out. It had been more than a year and a half since she\u2019d been with her father, and there was a distinct difference in his appearance. He didn\u2019t look well. His complexion had a gray tinge, and he\u2019d put on a little weight in his belly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a hectic week before the wedding...,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201c... and we don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvan Patterson.\u201d</p><p>He turned to her. \u201cYes, of course Patterson. I would rest easier if I knew where he was hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let him run our lives... ruin our lives,\u201d she corrected. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have that kind of power over us.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. The strain of worrying was there on his face. Her father was a distinguished-looking man with thick silver hair and handsome facial features. His shoulders were broad and straight, and she knew he tried to take care of himself, but stress could do so much damage, and he\u2019d lived with it for years. All because of Patterson and his sick obsession with her.</p><p>She was beginning to wonder whether coming home was a mistake.</p><p>Changing the subject to something more pleasant, she said, \u201cYou painted the house since I was last here. I like the color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe painted it last month,\u201d he replied, smiling now. \u201cYour mother has been on a cleaning frenzy because of the wedding. I\u2019ll take you to see the apartment above the garage. We finally cleaned it out. It didn\u2019t take much to spruce it up. The two bedrooms and the bath were in good shape, but we refinished the floors. All we had to do with the tiny kitchen was replace the stove and fix a pipe under the kitchen sink. Except for the plumbing and the electrical, your mother and I did most of the work,\u201d he said proudly.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you decide to do it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have so many relatives coming in for the wedding, and not all of them will want to stay in the motels or the one fancy hotel we have here in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should consider renting it out after the wedding,\u201d she suggested. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are students at the university who would love to have the space.\u201d</p><p>Her father shook his head and sat down on the sofa facing her. \u201cFinishing the apartment adds to the value of the property,\u201d he explained. \u201cI don\u2019t want any college kids tearing it up. This home is an asset, and that includes the apartment when it comes time to sell.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOh, Daddy, you love this house. You\u2019ll never sell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. I\u2019m getting old, and all those stairs...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother loves this house, too,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying sometime in the future.\u201d</p><p>The conversation ended when the back door opened and her mother called out, \u201cI need help carrying in the groceries.\u201d</p><p>Ellie jumped up and ran to the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>Her mother was so surprised to see her, she nearly dropped one of the bags on the floor. She quickly turned to set them on the kitchen counter and then grabbed Ellie for a long embrace. \u201cYou\u2019re early,\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>After Ellie had carried in the remaining groceries, her mother made her stand in front of her for an inspection. \u201cHave you grown? I swear you look taller. Maybe you\u2019re just thinner. Have you been eating? With those horrible long hours at the hospital, I\u2019ll bet you\u2019ve been skipping meals. Are you hungry, Ellie? I\u2019m defrosting a chicken casserole. It should be ready to pop in the oven. What about something to drink? I could fix you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, I\u2019m fine, and I\u2019m not a guest,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her mother smiled. \u201cI\u2019m just so happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>Ellie pulled a chair out at the kitchen table, told her mother to sit while she put the groceries away, and to please catch her up on all the news.</p><p>\u201cAva will be dropping by tomorrow or the day after. She\u2019s got so much to do still before the wedding. She and John just purchased the cutest little house about two miles from here. John\u2019s taken a position at the Winston Falls Clinic,\u201d she added.</p><p>Ellie put the milk in the refrigerator and folded the grocery bags.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be working next to the hospital,\u201d her mother went on. \u201cAva told me that dermatologists have set hours. That will be nice, won\u2019t it? To get home for supper each night?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mother was looking expectantly at her. She wanted some kind of a response or acknowledgment about Ava and John. Ellie refused to discuss either one of them, and so she stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cYour father and I are thrilled that John decided to move here. It will be nice to have them so close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will Annie get here?\u201d she asked, ignoring her mother\u2019s comments about Ava.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t leave San Diego until Thursday, but she\u2019ll be here for an entire week.\u201d</p> <p>Ellie pulled a chair out and sat down across from her mother. \u201cYou and Dad should go to San Diego sometime to visit her. It would be a great vacation for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh heavens, no. That would cost a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about finances?\u201d she asked.</p><p>It was a foolish question, she decided. Her mother and father were always worried about money. Just the expense of having her live so far away all those years had been a drain on them. The flights alone had been exorbitant.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not. We\u2019re frugal,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd we live on a budget.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe house looks wonderful, and Dad said the apartment is finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was time we cleaned up this old house and fixed up the apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look great, Mom.\u201d</p><p>It was a sincere compliment. Her mother was a beautiful woman. She still had the same figure as the day she was married. Ava and Annie shared their mother\u2019s bone structure and coloring. All three were slender and had honey blond hair and blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the new makeup. It\u2019s supposed to make you look rested.\u201d</p><p>Ellie laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s a new one. I\u2019ll have to buy some.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen, I know I didn\u2019t want to discuss this before, but I\u2019ve decided we need to talk about Ava, to clear the air before-\u201d</p><p>Ellie cut her off. She wasn\u2019t in the mood to hear about her sister. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk about Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he have his last physical? He doesn\u2019t look good, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him hear you say that. You\u2019ll hurt his feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s tired, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he should use some of your miracle makeup,\u201d she said, her irritation obvious in her voice.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you take that tone with me, young lady,\u201d she said. \u201cYour father is fine. He saw the doctor just last week.\u201d</p><p>Her mother was defensive, and Ellie couldn\u2019t understand why. She wasn\u2019t attacking her father. She was concerned about him.</p><p>She decided to let that subject go, too. The list of what she couldn\u2019t discuss was growing. Money and health and Ava. What was next?</p><p>Her mother reached across the table and took Ellie\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re home, and I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m a little short. There\u2019s just so much more to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father wants to paint all the bedrooms before the relatives arrive. He\u2019s finished our room and the study across the hall from us, and he\u2019s also done two of the bedrooms upstairs. He still has Annie\u2019s old room. You could help with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her father walked into the kitchen and put his hands on Ellie\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cEllie\u2019s going to help you paint,\u201d her mother told him.</p><p>\u201cGreat. After I get home from the university, we\u2019ll tackle Annie\u2019s old room together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have your room tonight, Ellie,\u201d her mother said. \u201cBut after painting, I don\u2019t want you upstairs until the fumes are gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to be sleeping in the garage apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps Aunt Vivien and Aunt Cecilia,\u201d her father suggested.</p><p>\u201cThose steps are too steep for Vivien,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cShe would have to go upstairs to get to the bedrooms in here,\u201d Ellie pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYes, but these steps aren\u2019t as steep. They\u2019re much wider, and there aren\u2019t as many of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Aunt Cecilia hasn\u2019t lost any weight, she won\u2019t be able to get up these stairs either. Besides, the aunts will want to be in the house with you and Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine they would,\u201d she agreed. \u201cThey like to be in the thick of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I stay in the garage apartment? And the aunts can stay here in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. You\u2019ll be all alone,\u201d her father said.</p><p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s ten feet from the house,\u201d she exaggerated. \u201cIf I get in trouble, I\u2019ll shout. You\u2019ll hear me.\u201d</p><p>Her father thought for a second. \u201cI suppose I could get another dead bolt and put it in... just to be on the safe side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would solve another problem, William,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cNow, Claire, you don\u2019t need to be bringing that up until we have time to sit and talk to Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we talking now?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cA serious talk,\u201d her father qualified.</p><p>She didn\u2019t like the sound of that. The last time they had a serious talk, they told her she couldn\u2019t come home for Christmas.</p><p>She turned to her mother. \u201cSolve what other problem?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cSince you brought it up, you might as well go ahead and tell her,\u201d her father said.</p><p>\u201cAva might be spending the night here, the night before the wedding. She doesn\u2019t want John to see her. She said it\u2019s bad luck.\u201d</p><p>Ellie couldn\u2019t resist a bit of sarcasm. \u201cIs she wearing black? Or red for-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s wearing a white gown,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a stretch,\u201d Ellie replied. \u201cIsn\u2019t she worried she\u2019ll be struck by lightning when she goes into the church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stop that right now,\u201d her mother snapped. \u201cWhat happened is in the past, and we have to find a way to move on.\u201d</p><p>Ellie didn\u2019t respond. Her father sat down at the round table between the two women. \u201cGo ahead and tell her the rest. Get it out in the open now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva still wants you to be in the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ellie answered vehemently. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to her since the last time I was here, and that was eighteen months ago. Why in God\u2019s name would she insist I be in the wedding? Mom, if you\u2019ll recall, she wanted you to ask me months ago, and I told you to tell her no. I haven\u2019t changed my mind. I only came back here because you and Dad insisted, and I will try to attend the wedding, but that\u2019s it.\u201d Shaking her head, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t know why she won\u2019t let it drop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are terrible rumors about what happened, and Ava believes that if you are in the wedding, people will know it was all a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumors? Not rumors... the truth, Mom. She can\u2019t rewrite history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks she\u2019ll be humiliated if you don\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you insisted I come home for the wedding? So Ava won\u2019t be humiliated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d her mother said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that people talk, and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be in the wedding. I\u2019m not even sure I can make myself go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about finding a bridesmaid dress,\u201d her mother continued. \u201cThey\u2019re all wearing long black dresses, and each one is different. Any black dress will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, you need to listen to me. I am not going to be in that wedding.\u201d</p><p>Her father stopped the argument. \u201cCome on, Ellie. We\u2019ll go to the hardware store to get a dead bolt, and then the grocery store to get you set up in the apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have dinner on the table in an hour and a half,\u201d her mother said. She was shaking her head at Ellie and looking pitiful. Ellie expected her to dab at her eyes next.</p><p>\u201cSee you later, Mom,\u201d Ellie said as she dutifully kissed her on the cheek. Then she whispered, \u201cGuilt doesn\u2019t work on me, Mom. I\u2019m not going to change my mind.\u201d</p><p>Her mother whispered back, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>Max and Ben had one last meeting with Agent Hughes to go over the details of the Landry case before they headed home to Honolulu.</p><p>\u201cGreg Roper pointed right at them,\u201d Hughes told Max. He sounded giddy. \u201cNo one helped or guided him to their photos. Isn\u2019t that right, Ben?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ve got an honest-to-God real witness,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cI won\u2019t put him on the list yet. This stays with us now, all right?\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. Hughes was getting smart. As soon as he gave the name to the prosecutor, a whole lot of people would have access to the information.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should get some protection for him,\u201d Ben suggested.</p><p>\u201cOnce he\u2019s been identified as a witness, we will,\u201d Hughes assured.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sean Goodman? The Landrys don\u2019t know whether he got a good look at them. Will you keep someone with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as he\u2019s in the hospital,\u201d Hughes answered. \u201cThere are too many people coming and going there, and security isn\u2019t the tightest. Just look at what happened with that gangbanger the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police claim he didn\u2019t fit the profile of a gangbanger,\u201d Max said. \u201cHas he been identified yet?\u201d</p><p>Ben shook his head. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any identification on him, and no one at the hospital admitted to knowing him. I talked to the detectives this morning. They\u2019re looking at all the hospital surveillance tapes, trying to see if someone dropped him off or if he had a car.\u201d</p><p>Max was not ready to dismiss the shooting as gang related just yet. \u201cMaybe we ought to be sure before we head to the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe sure of what?\u201d Hughes asked.</p><p>\u201cThat he was a gangbanger-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was,\u201d Hughes interrupted.</p><p>\u201cBut if he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Max continued as though he hadn\u2019t been interrupted. \u201cThen I\u2019ve got to ask...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh, he\u2019s doing the what-if\u2019s,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am,\u201d Max replied. \u201cAnd I\u2019m asking, what if he wasn\u2019t there to take out a rival gang? What if Sean Goodman was the target, and that rookie policeman stopped him before he could get to his floor?\u201d</p><p>Ben took his cell phone from his pocket. \u201cLet me give the detective I talked to a call. See if they\u2019ve found anything yet.\u201d</p><p>The conversation was brief, and when Ben ended his call, he turned to Max. \u201cThe cameras showed him getting out of his car. It was parked in the hospital\u2019s back corner lot. Nebraska plates. When they pulled up the plates, they found it registered to a George Cogburn.\u201d</p><p>Max looked at Hughes. \u201cYou know the name Cogburn, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Hughes nodded. \u201cYes, I do, though I haven\u2019t heard it in a long while. When the Landrys lived in Omaha, there was a Willis Cogburn who did some dirty work for them.\u201d</p><p>Ben went to a computer and, after typing his ID and password into the database, entered Willis Cogburn\u2019s name. A mug shot appeared on the screen. \u201cWillis just got out of prison,\u201d he told them. \u201cLooks like he could be back in action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe car was registered to a George Cogburn, though,\u201d Hughes reminded.</p><p>Ben did a search and pulled up George\u2019s driver\u2019s license. \u201cSame address. He resembles Willis, too. I\u2019d guess they\u2019re brothers or maybe cousins.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cThe question now is, where\u2019s Willis? If his brother was working for the Landrys, too, then he was at the hospital to go after witnesses. Maybe Willis doesn\u2019t want to go back to prison, and he sent his little brother to do the job for him.\u201d</p><p>Hughes had not been listening to their last exchange. He was busy on his cell phone. With the phone still to his ear, he told them, \u201cWillis checked in with his probation officer last Thursday. He doesn\u2019t see him again for a month. That\u2019s plenty of time for him to do some side work.\u201d</p><p>Ben said, \u201cOkay, so we now know that George Cogburn was after Sean Goodman. If that rookie hadn\u2019t seen the gun-\u201d</p><p>Max interjected, \u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t just Sean he was after.\u201d His jaw tightened as he thought about what this meant. \u201cIt looks like the Landrys aren\u2019t going to wait for an indictment this time. It\u2019s pretty obvious, they\u2019re looking for witnesses now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reliable witness we have is Greg Roper, and if we keep him under wraps, they won\u2019t get to him,\u201d Hughes assured.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ellie Sullivan?\u201d Max asked. \u201cThey were feet away from her on that track. They could be going after her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t going to be listed as a witness,\u201d Hughes insisted. \u201cThey don\u2019t even know who she is.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s temper was rising. \u201cDon\u2019t know who she is? Are you serious? One trip to the hospital, and they\u2019d know. Everyone\u2019s still talking about what happened. Ten minutes, Hughes. That\u2019s all it would take to get Ellie\u2019s name. George Cogburn went into that hospital to take out a witness, and Willis Cogburn could go after her next. I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll let that happen.\u201d</p><p>Hughes put his hands up. \u201cLook, I hear you. I\u2019ll see that someone warns her and that the hospital security is advised to be on the alert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not at the hospital,\u201d Max said. \u201cShe\u2019s gone back to her hometown in South Carolina to see her family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, then,\u201d Hughes said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d Ben countered. \u201cYou know as well as we do that the Landrys will stop at nothing to save themselves. Right now, we don\u2019t know where they are, and we don\u2019t know where Willis Cogburn is.\u201d</p><p>Max was adamant. \u201cEllie Sullivan needs protection.\u201d</p><p>Hughes started to argue, \u201cBut if she\u2019s not-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she needs it now,\u201d Max demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re the lead agent on this case, but if you won\u2019t order it, I will.\u201d</p><p>Hughes relented. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll call the field office in South Carolina and see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>A couple of hours later, Ben and Max were on their way to the airport to catch their flight back to Honolulu. Despite Hughes\u2019s assurance that Ellie would be guarded, there was a gnawing apprehension in the pit of Max\u2019s stomach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was about to go through security when his cell phone rang. It was Agent Hughes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t waste time on pleasantries.</p><p>\u201cJust got word from Omaha that Willis Cogburn hasn\u2019t been showing up at his apartment. They got inside for a search and found a note in his trash can with the names Sean Goodman and Dr. Ellie Sullivan on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019ve got someone on the way to her now,\u201d Max demanded.</p> <p>\u201cI did what I could, but we can\u2019t get anyone to Winston Falls for a couple of days, maybe even a week. Everyone at the nearest field office is tied up with cases, and they\u2019re understaffed. I\u2019ll talk to the locals down there. See if they can watch over her until she leaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t any help in the past when Ellie\u2019s family needed them. I don\u2019t trust them to do more than send a car by a couple of times a day. I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re a pretty small operation.\u201d</p><p>Hughes\u2019s frustration came through loud and clear. \u201cLook, I\u2019ll find someone. It\u2019s just going to take some time. Dr. Sullivan needs to be warned. I\u2019ll call her and caution her to be careful until we can get her some protection or until we\u2019ve got a handle on where all the players are.\u201d</p><p>Max immediately thought of the stress Ellie and her family were already feeling from the Patterson threat. \u201cDon\u2019t call her,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much choice here. She needs to be warned,\u201d Hughes argued.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Max blurted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hughes asked, surprised. \u201cYou can\u2019t go. You have to be back in Honolulu to work on the case there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take personal leave,\u201d Max said. \u201cJust for a week, until Ellie gets back home. Ben\u2019s got our end of the case under control. He can consult with me by phone. I\u2019ll make all the arrangements with the Honolulu office.\u201d</p><p>He ended the call before Hughes could say another word.</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>She wasn\u2019t happy to see him. In fact, she nearly had heart failure when Max pulled into the driveway. She was painting Annie\u2019s old bedroom on the second floor, and she happened to look out the window just as Max was getting out of his car.</p> <p>She was so rattled, she dropped the paintbrush. Fortunately, it landed on the tarp she\u2019d put down on the hardwood floors.</p><p>What was he doing here? Had something happened? Of course something had happened, she decided, answering her own question. He wouldn\u2019t be here otherwise.</p><p>Maybe he found out where Evan Patterson was hiding and wanted to tell her. No, no, if that was true, he would have picked up the phone and called her.</p><p>Oh Lord, her father was home. He was probably sitting on the front porch reading the news on his laptop. He was already stressed out. A federal agent stopping by could send him right over the edge.</p><p>Dressed in a pair of old shorts, a sleeveless blouse spotted with lavender paint, and flip-flops, she dashed down the stairs, flew through the living room, and ran outside. She passed her father without saying a word and came to a screeching halt about a foot in front of Max.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t seem to catch her breath, but it wasn\u2019t because she was out of shape. It was because of him. When he saw her, a huge smile spread across his face. That dimple in his cheek could cause foolish women to go weak in the knees. She wasn\u2019t a foolish woman, she reminded herself.</p><p>He looked sexy as sin. Damn it.</p><p>Her greeting wasn\u2019t polite. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>Max was looking past her. \u201cIs that your father? He looks like he\u2019s going to pass out. Ah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, what?\u201d she asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s staring at my gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJust great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy you could make it,\u201d she said loud enough for her father to hear. She then leaned up and kissed Max on his cheek.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t resist. He pulled her into his arms, told her she had paint in her hair, and kissed her on her mouth. It was quick but amazingly thorough. \u201cThat should put some color back in his face,\u201d he said.</p><p>She put her arms around his neck and whispered into his ear, \u201cI haven\u2019t told my parents about the shooting in the park... or about Sean Goodman... you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>Side by side they walked up the porch steps to where her father waited, and Ellie made the introductions.</p><p>\u201cDad, this is my friend Max Daniels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam Sullivan,\u201d her father said, stepping forward to shake his hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to meet you, sir.\u201d</p><p>Never one to mince words, William said, \u201cI notice you carry a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a badge,\u201d Ellie nervously interjected. \u201cHe carries a badge, too. Max is an agent with the FBI.\u201d</p><p>Frowning intently now, her father asked how the two had met. It was obvious he was suspicious.</p><p>\u201cThe hospital,\u201d she rushed to answer before Max could say a word. \u201cWe met in the hospital. His friend needed surgery.\u201d She added nonchalantly, \u201cRoutine stuff.\u201d</p><p>She was nodding vigorously, even as she tried to calm down. This wasn\u2019t the Inquisition. Why was she so nervous? She knew the answer to that one. She was a frickin\u2019 basket case because Max had astounded her, showing up the way he did.</p><p>Max could see the worry in her father\u2019s eyes, so he casually took hold of Ellie\u2019s hand and pulled her into his side. \u201cEllie did the surgery,\u201d he said proudly.</p><p>She nodded again. She was beginning to feel like a bobblehead doll. \u201cYes, I did, and Max and I started seeing each other.\u201d</p><p>She felt terrible lying to her father, but she justified her actions by reasoning that her motives were good. If she told him the truth, he would dwell on all the possibilities of what could have happened to her.</p><p>Her father visibly relaxed. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to meet one of Ellie\u2019s friends. Why don\u2019t we go inside and get something cool to drink. You must be parched.\u201d He motioned for them to go in ahead of him.</p><p>Ellie\u2019s mother came out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on a frilly apron. \u201cWilliam, dinner will be ready in-\u201d She stopped mid-sentence as soon as she saw Max, and her reaction was almost identical to her husband\u2019s when he\u2019d first noticed the gun.</p><p>\u201cClaire, this is Max Daniels,\u201d William said. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend of Ellie\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mother,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cA friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said as she nervously patted her hair. Her gaze bounced back and forth between the pair.</p><p>Max smiled as he took her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, you\u2019re handsome.\u201d She laughed after making the comment. \u201cYou\u2019re staying for dinner, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>Her mother beamed with pleasure. What had come over her? Ellie wondered.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we sit in our hearth room just off the kitchen,\u201d her father suggested.</p><p>Where they could grill him, Ellie thought. And she was right. The questions began, one on top of the other.</p><p>Ellie didn\u2019t know whether Max liked sweet tea or not, but the glass was offered, and he accepted. She stood by the kitchen island, watching, and had the most amazing revelation: Max could be charming. And her mother? She was so excited and flustered, she was blushing. Was her behavior because her daughter had finally found another man? That possibility riled. Or was her mother acting strange because Max was so adorable... with her, anyway.</p><p>\u201cEllie, why don\u2019t you go upstairs and change before dinner,\u201d her mother suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost finished painting the room. I just have the trim to do.\u201d And one wall, she silently added. \u201cWhen is dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help paint,\u201d Max said.</p><p>Ellie was all for that. She couldn\u2019t wait to get him alone and find out why he had come all this way.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re a guest,\u201d her father said.</p><p>\u201cHe likes to paint,\u201d Ellie rushed to say.</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be staying?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>\u201cNo time at all,\u201d Ellie answered for him.</p><p>Neither parent paid any attention to her.</p><p>\u201cWilliam, Max is Ellie\u2019s plus one. He\u2019ll be staying at least until after the wedding. Won\u2019t you, Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my what?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cYour plus one, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving when Ellie leaves,\u201d Max said, and the look he shot her suggested she not argue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be flying back with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was shaking her head at Max. Her parents ignored her protest and so did he.</p><p>\u201cOur daughter couldn\u2019t be in safer hands, with her own FBI agent at her side,\u201d William said. \u201cHave you checked into one of the motels or the hotel yet?\u201d he asked Max.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, I came directly here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay in the apartment over the garage. It\u2019s not as bad as it sounds. In fact, it\u2019s very comfortable, isn\u2019t it, Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying in the apartment,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear, you are,\u201d her mother agreed.</p><p>\u201cThere are two bedrooms,\u201d her father reminded her.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re both adults,\u201d her mother added.</p><p>Ellie was speechless. It was so unlike her father to be lackadaisical about sleeping arrangements. Yes, she was an adult, but until this minute, her father had never treated her as such. And her mother\u2019s attitude was even more shocking. She was always so prim and proper, a true Southern lady, who tended to worry a little too much about what other people would say. She apparently didn\u2019t give a hoot about them now, though.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019ll sleep easier knowing you\u2019ll be watching out for her,\u201d William said. \u201cHas Ellie mentioned Evan Patterson to you?\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cYes, sir, I know all about him.\u201d</p><p>He sighed with relief. \u201cMy daughter keeps things inside. I wasn\u2019t sure whether she\u2019d shared her past with you, but I\u2019m very pleased she did. Now you understand why I\u2019m happy you\u2019ll be staying with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, Max didn\u2019t say he could stay-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d William said. \u201cDo you think after dinner we might sit down and talk about Patterson for a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to find out about you two,\u201d her mother said. \u201cHow long you\u2019ve been seeing each other and how-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, Mom,\u201d Ellie interrupted. \u201cAfter dinner you may ask all the questions you want. The paintbrushes are going to dry out. Come on, Max. You offered to paint. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He followed her upstairs. She was muttering something, but Max couldn\u2019t make out what she was saying. From her tone, he knew she wasn\u2019t happy. Too bad, he thought. He had come all this way to protect her, and by God, that was exactly what he was going to do.</p><p>Concentrating solely on the job was going to take discipline. The first thought he\u2019d had when he\u2019d arrived at her house and saw her coming down the stairs toward him was that she was safe, and he\u2019d felt a tremendous jolt of relief. The second thought was less professional. He\u2019d wondered if her legs had gotten longer since he\u2019d last seen her. By the time she\u2019d reached him, he\u2019d conjured up all sorts of fantasies about her.</p><p>Ellie led the way into Annie\u2019s bedroom. Max took a step back when he saw the color on the walls.</p><p>She waited until he had shut the door behind him and then said, \u201cIt\u2019s bad, isn\u2019t it? Of course, it\u2019s bad. You wouldn\u2019t have come here if it was good news. You would have called, right? So it\u2019s bad. Just tell me, Max. How bad?\u201d</p><p>Max heard her father coming up the stairs. Now wasn\u2019t the time to explain. Ellie was bound to get upset, and from her father\u2019s response to seeing his gun, Max knew he wouldn\u2019t take the news well at all.</p><p>\u201cRoller or brush?\u201d Max said.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>He repeated the question just as her father opened the door and stepped inside, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll use the roller. Why don\u2019t you two paint the trim. How much do you have left to do, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo windows,\u201d she answered.</p><p>The trim was white, the walls an iridescent shade of lavender. Max took one window, Ellie the other. She kept glancing over at him while she tried to think of a way to get her father to leave, but he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. He was in a cheerful and chatty mood, no doubt because her friend was armed.</p><p>Once again she felt a pang of guilt. Having her home was a burden for him. She shouldn\u2019t have given in to her mother\u2019s pleas. It would have been so much better for her father if she had stayed away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to see the falls while you\u2019re here. It\u2019s a short hike but worth it, isn\u2019t it, Ellie?\u201d he asked as he poured paint into the roller pan.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d she replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know that Max will have time-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure he will,\u201d her father argued. \u201cYou did say you were going to be here until Ellie leaves, didn\u2019t you, Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Max answered.</p><p>Ellie glared at him. He winked at her.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you two been seeing each other?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>Determined to nip the personal questions in the bud, she said, \u201cAwhile now, Dad. Max, did I tell you that my father has a Ph.D. in mathematics? He\u2019s a dean now at the university. Did I mention that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, Max doesn\u2019t want to hear about my achievements. I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s curious about yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Max said. \u201cWhat was she like as a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifficult,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Max said.</p><p>\u201cHey...,\u201d she began in protest.</p><p>\u201cAnd challenging,\u201d her father added. \u201cShe kept... amazing us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Pausing in his task, William held the roller over the pan while he considered which story to tell.</p><p>\u201cShe was about seven or eight, and there was a visiting professor...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy, don\u2019t tell the auditorium story.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEllie, it\u2019s one of my favorites,\u201d he protested.</p><p>She knew it was pointless to argue. When her father was set on something, no one could change his mind.</p><p>\u201cI was much older,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He ignored her correction. \u201cThere was this professor in mathematics from England. Dr. Nigel Goodrick was his name, and he was a real interesting fellow. He never would have lectured at such a small university, but he was visiting a relative who happened to live here, and so he agreed. Goodrick was a bit persnickety and quite arrogant. Wasn\u2019t he, Ellie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought he was mean,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he smelled funny, like mothballs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie was spending a couple of hours with me at the university that afternoon, and it just happened to be the time Dr. Goodrick had picked to give a lecture to our math students on the great nineteenth-century German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. We anticipated a large gathering, so the lecture was moved to the main auditorium. He was down on the stage, and Ellie and I were sitting on the aisle about fifteen or twenty rows back. The kids, the students... were bored. I\u2019ll admit Professor Goodrick was a little dull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a snooze,\u201d Ellie interjected. She was working on the windowsill and stepped back to check her work.</p><p>\u201cNo one left the auditorium, though. The students were getting extra credit by attending, but instead of signing in, they had to sign out after the lecture was over. Otherwise, they would have left. Most of them zoned out the minute he began his dissertation on Gauss\u2019s life and his contributions to mathematics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say that I would have been any different,\u201d Max admitted. \u201cAfraid I\u2019ve never heard of Gauss.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not in the field, it\u2019s unlikely that you would know much about him,\u201d William said. \u201cYou could have heard a pin drop in that auditorium, but it was because most of the audience was asleep-which made what Ellie did all the more conspicuous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cDr. Goodrick had just told one of the legends about Gauss. It\u2019s said that he was quite precocious as a youngster and was always getting in trouble in school. One day a teacher, for punishment, told him to add all the numbers between one and one hundred. Of course, the teacher assumed that this would keep young Friedrich busy for quite some time, but when Gauss completed it in just seconds, the teacher was astonished.</p><p>\u201cDr. Goodrick told this story, and then he asked if any of the students in his audience could tell him the answer that Gauss came up with or how he did it. The room was silent. Several moments passed, and then Ellie stood up and looked around the auditorium...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was waiting for one of the big kids to raise a hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no one did,\u201d her father said. \u201cAnd so my daughter raised her hand. I remember Goodrick had a smirk on his face as he berated the students for not having even a guess, and he accused them of not paying attention-which, if you think about it, was actually a criticism of his lecturing skills-but he finally noticed Ellie and pointed to her. \u2018A child has a question for me?\u2019 he asked.\u201d</p> <p>Max smiled. He had a feeling he knew what was coming.</p><p>\u201cEllie looked embarrassed because now everyone was staring at her, but she said, \u2018No, sir. I know the answer-five thousand fifty.\u2019 Goodrick then saw me sitting beside her and, thinking I had fed the answer to her, wagged the marker at her and challenged her to show the audience how she arrived at the conclusion.\u201d</p><p>Ellie turned around and interrupted her father\u2019s account. \u201cI\u2019m finished with this window. Want me to help you finish yours?\u201d she asked Max.</p><p>\u201cAnd did she?\u201d Max asked William, ignoring her.</p><p>\u201cShe certainly did,\u201d he answered. \u201cShe went up on the stage, took the marker from him, and showed that the problem could be broken down into fifty pairs of identical sums of one hundred one. And fifty times one hundred one gives the answer: five thousand fifty. Goodrick looked thunderstruck, but to his credit, he did congratulate her on getting it right. He then asked if she could solve another problem. I realized he was trying his best to trick her with the second one, but she got that right, too.\u201d</p><p>Ellie waved her brush at her father. \u201cDad, Max doesn\u2019t want to hear-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Max said.</p><p>Her father continued, \u201cI put a stop to it after those two problems and took Ellie home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe made me promise not to tell Mom what happened,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cClaire and I had agreed to help our daughter lead as normal a life as possible,\u201d William said. \u201cGetting up onstage and drawing attention to her capabilities at such a young age... her mother and I didn\u2019t want that, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>He looked sheepish. \u201cAnd I knew I\u2019d catch hell if my wife found out.\u201d He laughed and said, \u201cI swear it was the only time I allowed her to perform in public. Ellie always loved math. She read all the books I brought home, and she and I would do problems together every now and then at night when the twins were having their baths or doing their homework.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately, her father resisted the need to tell more stories about her, and Ellie was thankful. She finished the painting, and while her father took Max out to the garage to show him the apartment, she showered and changed into clean jeans and a blouse.</p><p>Her mother didn\u2019t approve of the outfit. \u201cYou should put on a skirt. We have company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, he\u2019s just a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSet the table in the dining room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a huge, round kitchen table. Max will be just as comfortable here. Besides, you\u2019ve already got it set for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just thought it should be a little more formal. When Ava and John come for dinner, she always insists we dine in the dining room.\u201d</p><p>Of course she does, Ellie thought. Ava was all about appearances.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to impress him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right. Go ahead and set a place for him at the kitchen table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d She kissed her mother on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re in such a good mood...,\u201d her mother began.</p><p>Ellie got a plate down from the cabinet. \u201cThe answer is still no.\u201d</p><p>She carried the silverware and linen napkin to the table and set a place for Max. Never in a million years would she have guessed she\u2019d be doing this for him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m going to ask,\u201d her mother said as she began to gather vegetables from the refrigerator.</p><p>Ellie took them from her and put them on the counter next to the sink. Her mother handed her a chopping board.</p><p>\u201cI was just saying that since you\u2019re in a good mood, you might want to reconsider...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be in the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Eleanor Kathleen...,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll break your sister\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>Ellie shook her head slowly. \u201cGuilt isn\u2019t going to work. The answer is no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d her father asked as he came in the back door with Max.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter is being stubborn,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>Max was carrying tomatoes from the garden William had proudly shown him. He laid them in the sink and turned the water on to wash them. Next to him, Ellie was chopping vegetables. Her mother saw how fast she was working and immediately cautioned her.</p><p>\u201cYou be careful with that knife. It\u2019s sharp.\u201d</p><p>Ellie didn\u2019t look up. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd slow down, for heaven\u2019s sake. You\u2019ll cut your finger off. Here, give that knife to me. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll slow down,\u201d Ellie promised.</p><p>Her father had gone into the hearth room and was standing with his hands in his pockets, watching the news on television, and her mother had gone into the dining room to get one of her fancy salad bowls when Max leaned into Ellie\u2019s side. \u201cYour mom knows you\u2019re a surgeon, right?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYes, she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s got to know you use sharp knives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth my mom and dad know what I have become, but neither one of them saw me get there. I was a child when I left home. They weren\u2019t there to see the progress from university to medical school to residency to fellowship. They didn\u2019t hear all the stories that happen during training.\u201d</p><p>William walked into the kitchen. \u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears it will be a while before dinner is ready. Do you have a minute to step out in the backyard and have a talk?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh, Ellie didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cA talk about what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPatterson,\u201d her father answered. \u201cIf Max is interested, I thought I would catch him up on what I\u2019ve learned from my friends in the FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Max said. \u201cI\u2019ve got the time.\u201d Turning to Ellie, he whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t you leave this house.\u201d</p><p>Ellie stood at the sink, staring out at the yard. She couldn\u2019t see the two men, but she could hear the low murmur of their voices. She was certain Max was asking all sorts of questions.</p><p>He knew just about everything about her; she knew absolutely nothing about him. Well, not exactly. She knew he lived in Honolulu but grew up in Montana. And that was it. Sisters? Brothers? She didn\u2019t have a clue. She needed a plan, she decided, to get through dinner. As soon as it was over, she\u2019d get him alone and start demanding answers.</p><p>Dinner was a challenge.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you grow up, Max?\u201d her father asked as Claire served the salads.</p><p>\u201cButte, Montana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre your parents still living there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cWhen I was a freshman in college, they moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they live in Minneapolis now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gets so cold there and so much snow,\u201d her mother interjected.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think it would be too much different from Montana. Gets real cold there, too,\u201d her father said. \u201cWhat does your father do for a living, Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an attorney,\u201d he answered. \u201cHe worked for the Department of the Interior for twenty-five years, retired, and now works as a children\u2019s advocate for the State of Minnesota.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmirable,\u201d William said. \u201cI imagine it\u2019s a difficult job. Do you have any brothers or sisters?\u201d he asked without pausing.</p><p>Ellie listened to the interrogation with mixed feelings. She wanted to hear more about Max, but she was terrified by the possibilities of where the discussion would lead.</p><p>\u201cDad, stop with the questions please,\u201d she said. \u201cMax isn\u2019t interviewing for a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just having a friendly conversation,\u201d her father protested.</p><p>Max, Ellie noticed, didn\u2019t seem the least fazed by all the questions. She, on the other hand, was sick to her stomach and could barely get her salad down. She never should have lied to her father. As soon as she\u2019d introduced him to Max, she should have told him the truth, but she didn\u2019t. She made the decision to keep quiet because her father hadn\u2019t looked well, and she\u2019d put him through such heartache. How could she have burdened him with more?</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother? Does she work outside the home?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>\u201cShe teaches music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny brothers or sisters?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDad, enough already. Let Max eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sisters,\u201d he answered. \u201cI have six brothers. Simon\u2019s the oldest, then me, then Bishop, Sebastian, Bradley, Tyler, and Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents had their hands full with so many boys,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>\u201cSimon Daniels,\u201d her father said. \u201cThat\u2019s the same name as the football player Ellie\u2019s so crazy about. He\u2019s always her number-one pick in her fantasy football leagues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I get first choice,\u201d Ellie explained.</p><p>Max flashed a smile. \u201cYou know who Simon Daniels is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know him. He\u2019s one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. His stats last year were amazing: over forty-three hundred yards passing, a sixty-eight percent completion rate, lowest number of interceptions in the league. Don\u2019t you follow football?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I do,\u201d he replied. \u201cHow many fantasy leagues are you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cutting back to two this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax, would you like more roast beef?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does your brother do for a living?\u201d William asked as he took the platter that Claire handed him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a football player.\u201d</p><p>Silence followed the statement. It didn\u2019t last long. Ellie dropped her fork.</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me your brother is the Simon Daniels, the future Hall of Famer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s mother looked puzzled. \u201cBut he\u2019s African-American, and you\u2019re... not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2019s parents adopted me,\u201d he explained. He smiled as he added, \u201cThen they got on a roll and adopted the others. I was eight years old when my adoption was final.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your biological parents?\u201d William asked.</p><p>\u201cCar accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more questions, Dad,\u201d Ellie pleaded.</p><p>She knew her face was flushed. She could feel the heat in her cheeks. Max had all but knocked her off her feet with his ohso-casual announcement that Simon, the perfect quarterback, was his brother. She was flabbergasted and trying not to let it show.</p><p>\u201cEllie, I couldn\u2019t help but notice you looked thunderstruck by the news that Simon was Max\u2019s brother. You didn\u2019t know?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>\u201cUh... no,\u201d she stammered. \u201cMax never mentioned it.\u201d Her mind raced to find an excuse. \u201cBut I understand why,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cEnlighten me,\u201d he persisted, frowning now.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted me to like him for him... not who he\u2019s related to,\u201d she explained and hoped to heaven she was making sense.</p><p>Her father nodded, and that gave Ellie hope that he was buying yet another lie.</p><p>\u201cThere are still lots of things about Max I don\u2019t know yet,\u201d she said. Was that ever an understatement! \u201cWe\u2019re getting to know each other.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pushed her chair back, stood, and snatched Max\u2019s plate. She was on her way to the sink as she asked, \u201cFinished, Max?\u201d</p><p>She cleared the rest of the dishes while her father told an amusing story about one of the professors at the university. Then the topic moved to the wedding.</p><p>\u201cThe relatives will be pouring in here in two more days, and William and I have been frantically working on the house,\u201d her mother announced.</p><p>\u201cNot frantically, Claire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre there any other bedrooms that need painting?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, the lavender room was the last,\u201d William said.</p><p>\u201cWho chose that color?\u201d</p><p>Ellie was rinsing the salad bowl and putting it in the dishwasher. \u201cYou don\u2019t like the color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I just wondered who chose it.\u201d</p> <p>Her parents glanced at each other before answering. The question seemed to surprise them.</p><p>\u201cNo one chose it,\u201d Ellie\u2019s mother said. \u201cWe purchased what was on sale, didn\u2019t we, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. That particular color had been discontinued.\u201d</p><p>Max could understand why. The color practically glowed.</p><p>\u201cWe got it for a song,\u201d William said proudly.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some coffee, Max?\u201d Claire asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>By this time, most of the dishes had been cleared, rinsed, and placed in the dishwasher by Ellie. Her mother carried a pitcher to the counter, and Ellie practically wrenched it from her hands to begin washing it.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d her mother said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you and Max get settled in your rooms for the night. It\u2019s been a long day, and I know you two would like some alone time to catch up. And just maybe, after a good night\u2019s rest, you\u2019ll reevaluate your position on the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you that won\u2019t happen,\u201d she said, and before her mother could start in again, Ellie rushed ahead, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to finish the dishes?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, she grabbed Max\u2019s hand and headed for the back door.</p><p>Max made her wait while he thanked her parents for dinner, then followed her outside.</p><p>\u201cI like your parents.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look over her shoulder as she crossed the yard at a fast clip to get to the steps.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she agreed. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably got a hundred questions about my family, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cOkay, maybe a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She rushed up the stairs and waited for Max to unlock the dead bolts. He leaned around her, wrapping her in his arms as he slipped the keys in the dead bolts and unlocked the door. If she moved at all, her lips would touch his warm skin. He swung the door open and pulled back so she could go inside.</p><p>She walked to the center of the living room, turned around, and folded her arms in front of her while she waited for him to lock the door and give her his full attention. As soon as he was facing her, she said, \u201cOkay, start talking. Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>He leaned against the door and grinned. \u201cI thought it was my turn to ask questions.\u201d</p><p>She sighed in frustration. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give you two. Then you start explaining. Go ahead. Ask away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a plus one?\u201d</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>They were on round three of the argument.</p><p>Max had taken a shower, put on a clean T-shirt and jeans, grabbed the channel changer, and now sat on the lumpy sofa with his bare feet up on an ottoman, trying to watch the late news on a television screen the size of a breadbox while he patiently waited for Ellie to calm down and be reasonable. He doubted it was going to happen anytime soon.</p><p>The remote kept falling apart in his hand. It had been duct taped together, but the tape was obviously old. He made the mental note to buy a universal remote tomorrow or another roll of tape. It was downright barbaric not to have a decent channel changer.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d he lied.</p><p>God, she looked good. He watched her resume her pacing while she ranted. She had also showered and was now wearing a pale pink-and-white-striped nightgown that barely touched her knees, and a matching long cotton robe that tied at the waist. The robe was too big for her, and the hem dragged on the floor, but to him she looked sexier than if she had been wearing a flimsy negligee. She looked hot in everything she wore, even the baggy scrubs he\u2019d first seen her in.</p><p>Unaware of where his thoughts were, Ellie continued her tirade. She had every reason to be upset. She hadn\u2019t said a word while he\u2019d explained his reason for coming to Winston Falls and his intent to be her shadow until the two of them returned to her home, but when he\u2019d finished explaining, she\u2019d reacted. She hadn\u2019t flipped out on him, though. She\u2019d become outraged, and he much preferred that reaction. Furious was better to work with than terrified or weepy.</p><p>\u201cYou are not telling my father or my mother.\u201d She was so irate her voice shook. She wasn\u2019t a screamer, and he appreciated that, too.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d he calmly announced for the sixth or seventh time now. \u201cThey need to be aware of the danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t even certain the Landrys hired anyone to kill Sean or me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am certain. Ellie, we\u2019ve been over this. I\u2019m staying with you until you\u2019re safely back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Willis Cogburn hasn\u2019t been captured or killed, another agent will take over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he tries to hurt you, damn right I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d Anger swelled up inside him at the thought of anyone hurting her.</p><p>\u201cYou have to capture him, not shoot him,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThen you can make a deal with him for a lighter sentence so he\u2019ll testify against the Landrys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a physician, not an attorney,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense, doesn\u2019t it? Ask a lawyer. He\u2019ll agree with me. Willis Cogburn should stay alive to testify.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a lawyer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you, hit men don\u2019t usually testify. And if I have to shoot him, I\u2019m shooting to kill.\u201d</p><p>Hands on hips, she glared at him. \u201cWhen did you become a lawyer?\u201d</p><p>The conversation was becoming ludicrous. She was acting as though he\u2019d pulled a fast one on her by going to law school.</p><p>\u201cRight after I graduated from Vanderbilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cVanderbilt University Law School in Nashville,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen the FBI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re smart, too.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. Tired of pacing, Ellie went into the tiny kitchen. She got a Diet Coke out of the refrigerator, got another for Max, and went back to the living room. She sat down beside him, handed him his drink, and swung her feet up on the ottoman next to his.</p><p>\u201cYou saw the look on my father\u2019s face when you got out of your car and he noticed the gun at your side. In that instant, he went from happy to scared.\u201d She put her unopened can on the table, sat back, and said, \u201cI\u2019ve taught him to expect the worst.\u201d</p><p>Max put his arm around her and pulled her into his side. \u201cEllie, you know I\u2019m right. Your dad needs to be aware, and I\u2019m required to inform him of the possible danger. It\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve put him through enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve put him through enough? You haven\u2019t done anything wrong. You are not responsible for Evan Patterson\u2019s obsession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntellectually, I know that\u2019s true, but in my heart, I feel as though I\u2019m at fault somehow. I know it doesn\u2019t make any sense, but there it is all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you when it started with Patterson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had just had my eleventh birthday.\u201d It was a full year of hell, she thought but didn\u2019t say.</p><p>\u201cReason it through. You were a little girl. You didn\u2019t do or say anything to encourage him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t the only one affected by his bizarre behavior. Some days, especially when my dad wasn\u2019t home, he would walk up and down our street, staring at our house as he passed by. He would do it for hours and hours,\u201d she said. \u201cAnnie was terrified. She had to have all the lights on in her bedroom at night, and I could hear her crying under the covers. That\u2019s why she\u2019s becoming a lawyer. She\u2019ll end up doing something in criminal justice. Ava went the other way. She lashed out. She was angry all the time-angry at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. You know none of this is your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change how my family feels. My poor dad is quietly freaking out because no one can find Patterson, and now you want to tell him that there\u2019s a killer out there hunting me.\u201d</p><p>She stood, grabbed her can of soda, and put it back in the refrigerator. There was a door at the end of the kitchen that led down into the garage. She made sure it was locked, then checked the other door to make absolutely certain both dead bolts were in place, and headed to the bedroom.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even thought about the sleeping arrangements or a bed with Max in it until she opened the door to the room she\u2019d slept in the night before. There was a queen-size bed her parents had gotten at a discount store. In the smaller bedroom was a double bed that used to belong to her aunt Eleanor, the woman she was named after. The bed had been in her aunt\u2019s guest room, but when the older woman downsized, she\u2019d donated the bed to the apartment.</p><p>Ellie thought she should probably sleep there because Max was so much bigger than she was.</p><p>Or she could sleep with him. That thought sent her heart racing. No, that can\u2019t happen, she told herself. She wanted him to go away, not stay... didn\u2019t she?</p><p>Talk about conflicted. Back home, after their date, he\u2019d kissed her senseless, and when he\u2019d left, she had regretted not sleeping with him. And now? Max was just feet away from her, and right this minute she couldn\u2019t come up with a single reason why she shouldn\u2019t throw herself into his arms.</p><p>The apartment seemed to be closing in on her. The air conditioner had stopped, and the temperature was rising. Thinking about wrapping her arms around Max\u2019s hard body wasn\u2019t helping her cool off. Just one night. What would be the harm?</p><p>Ellie went into the bathroom and brushed her teeth again just to give herself time to come to her senses. Yes, she wanted him. Okay, nothing wrong with admitting it, and, yes, it would be amazing and electrifying, but it would also just be a brief physical release. A great, mind-blowing release, she qualified.</p><p>The fantasies were bombarding her, but she blocked them from her mind. She couldn\u2019t let her hormones or her animal instincts take control. Besides, Max would still be here in the morning, so she couldn\u2019t pretend she\u2019d had a temporary lack of sanity.</p><p>She took a good long look in the mirror and shook her head at her reflection. She wanted more than casual sex. She wanted romance. She felt silly admitting it, even though it was true. She had worked so long and so hard on her career that it had all but consumed her, leaving no room for the fanciful or the impractical. But deep down, it had always been there. She was a romantic at heart. There wasn\u2019t anything practical or reasonable about it.</p><p>Okay, she\u2019d made up her mind. She wasn\u2019t a rabbit, and she wasn\u2019t going to hop into bed with any man-no matter how hot he was-without first having an emotional connection.</p><p>As she was opening the door, it suddenly occurred to her that all her angst might have been for nothing. Max hadn\u2019t made any moves or given any indication that he\u2019d like to go to bed with her. Still, the electricity was there between them. If she could feel it, so could he.</p><p>When she entered the living room, Max was sitting on the sofa, leaning forward with all the broken pieces of the channel changer spread out on the ottoman in front of him. The old tape hadn\u2019t held, and the plastic cover had broken in several places.</p><p>\u201cSomeone must have thrown this against a couple of walls,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIs there any tape around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look,\u201d she said as she retied the belt on her robe. It dragged on the floor when she walked into the kitchen, and she really wanted to take the thing off because the air was becoming stifling.</p><p>She found some Scotch tape in one of the kitchen drawers and two thick rubber bands.</p><p>Max quickly put the remote back together and reinforced it with the rubber bands, then he sat back and began to channelsurf. She sat down next to him.</p><p>\u201cMen and their remotes,\u201d she said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cWomen and their hair stuff,\u201d he countered.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHair stuff?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou know. That lacquer stuff they spray on their hair. You don\u2019t,\u201d he added, \u201cbut a lot of women do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around her and his fingers slid through her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s soft, not stiff, and my fingers don\u2019t get caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of women have you been going out with?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. He was rubbing the back of her neck, though, and it felt wonderful.</p><p>\u201cYour hair\u2019s so soft. Smells good, too. Like strawberries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know...\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve got a good memory.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. So did she. She remembered his mouth on hers, the touch of his tongue rubbing against hers, the taste of him, the way he\u2019d held her in his arms, his masculine scent... oh yes, she had a good memory, too.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s hot in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d he said, turning back to the television. \u201cDid you turn the air conditioner up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should explain how the thermostat works. It\u2019s right outside your bedroom door,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get the bigger bed because you\u2019re...\u201d</p><p>Wow. All he had to do was look at her, and she lost her train of thought. There was a warm glint in his eyes that captivated her. The man just kept getting better and better.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m what?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a clue. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou said I get the bigger bedroom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re bigger than I am. It\u2019s a queen, so your feet may still hang over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the thermostat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d She really needed to stop staring at him so she could concentrate.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it I need to know?\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to look at the television when she explained. \u201cIt only has two settings no matter where you turn the dial. Hot, like now-only it will get hotter-or cold-and not just cold, arctic cold. You choose,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSweat or freeze are the choices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreeze.\u201d</p><p>She patted his knee. \u201cThen that\u2019s what we\u2019ll hope for.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any control over it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d found out the night before how faulty the air conditioner was. She had alternated between near heatstroke and frostbite all night long. It was miserable. She had intended to mention the problem to her father this morning, but she\u2019d forgotten about it until now, and the heat index was rapidly rising.</p><p>She loosened the neck of her robe and fanned herself. \u201cDo you mind if I watch SportsCenter? The roundup is coming on soon.\u201d</p><p>He handed her the remote as he asked, \u201cHow old is the air conditioner?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s brand-new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why...\u201d</p><p>She found the channel, muted the program that was ending, and turned to Max. \u201cDaddy got a deal,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t buy anything unless he can get a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if he got it for half price, if it doesn\u2019t work-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf price isn\u2019t a deal to my father. Eighty percent maybe, but not fifty.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHe should take it back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, he should,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut he won\u2019t. He\u2019ll get a repairman to fix it one of these days. I\u2019ll mention it to him tomorrow. Would you like a beer? You can\u2019t watch SportsCenter without a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re a dream come true. A beautiful woman who likes SportsCenter and drinks beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not such a rare breed,\u201d she said.</p><p>She put his unopened can of Diet Coke back in the refrigerator, got out two bottles of Bud Light and a jar of mixed nuts, and went back to the sofa. She handed Max one bottle, twisted the cap off the other, then tapped his bottle and took a drink.</p><p>She put the jar of nuts on the table and sat down next to him. \u201cIt\u2019s getting hotter in here,\u201d she said as she placed the cold bottle against the side of her neck. She adjusted her position on the couch a couple of times and ended up leaning into him. \u201cI\u2019d move over and give you some room, but there\u2019s a lump, and it\u2019s very uncomfortable. I think a spring\u2019s about to pop through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you pressed against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making you hot?\u201d After asking the suggestive question, she put her bottle against his cheek. \u201cFeel good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel good. The roundup is on.\u201d</p> <p>It was one of her favorite shows, and tonight the topic was once again the upcoming football season. Simon\u2019s name was mentioned about a dozen times. Max was answering texts, but she noticed he smiled whenever one of the commentators complimented his brother. He didn\u2019t show any reaction to the criticisms.</p><p>Halfway through the program, Ellie removed her robe. She didn\u2019t care whether it was appropriate or not. She was burning up.</p><p>\u201cWe could open the windows in the bedrooms, maybe get a crosswind. They\u2019re the only windows that open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like outside now?\u201d</p><p>She found her cell phone, looked up the weather, and groaned. \u201cIt\u2019s ninety and humid. I think we\u2019re going to have to sleep in the house tonight. This is worse than paint fumes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can suffer through it if you can,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only for one night. We\u2019re leaving tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cI was going to bring it up if you didn\u2019t. We can\u2019t stay here. If there were a fire, we\u2019d be trapped, and walking down the outside steps would give anyone a clear shot. We\u2019re going to have to find a better place to stay, one that isn\u2019t open-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not trapped here,\u201d she argued. \u201cWe could go down the stairs that lead into the garage or even go out one of the back windows. There\u2019s a rope in the garage, and it really isn\u2019t too much of a jump...\u201d She stopped, realizing there was no need to protest. \u201cYou misunderstand. I want to leave Winston Falls and go back to St. Louis. If I stay here, I\u2019m putting my family in danger.\u201d</p><p>Ellie stared at the television but she wasn\u2019t paying attention to the program. Frustration was building inside her again because she didn\u2019t have any control over what was happening. She put her beer down and went to check the thermostat. She hadn\u2019t even touched it when she felt a blast of cold air come through the vent in the hall.</p><p>\u201cWe now have air-conditioning,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cGood to hear.\u201d He turned off the television and stood. \u201cAre you serious about going back home?\u201d</p><p>He was walking toward her, and she was feeling breathless again. \u201cYes, I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will your dad feel about your leaving?\u201d</p><p>She thought about it a few seconds and then said, \u201cHe\u2019ll be relieved, and that will make him feel guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst thing in the morning,\u201d she said. She leaned against the wall, and he stopped in front of her.</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God. She\u2019ll have a fit. She won\u2019t believe anything I say once I tell her I\u2019m leaving. It\u2019s not going to be pretty,\u201d she added.</p><p>The dark look in his eyes made swallowing difficult. She wanted him to take her into his arms. She wanted him. She tried to block the thought but didn\u2019t have much success. Did he have to be so provocative and mesmerizing?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to tell why we\u2019re leaving,\u201d she said. \u201cAgreed? You are not going to tell my father about Willis Cogburn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sweetheart, I am. I\u2019m obligated to warn him of the possible danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll be gone-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>She poked him in the chest. \u201cThis is exactly why I\u2019m not going to sleep with you. You\u2019d feel obligated to tell.\u201d</p><p>Max brushed her hair over her shoulder and trailed his fingers down the side of her cheek. Her skin was silky and soft, and he didn\u2019t think there was a single flaw in her complexion. \u201cI don\u2019t remember asking...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t want...\u201d</p><p>He leaned down. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>She smiled sweetly. \u201cI could have you in bed in less than ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Max loved the way she smiled. Her eyes sparkled with such devilment. Damn, he wanted her. He leaned even closer until his mouth was just inches above hers and whispered, \u201cFive minutes, sweetheart. That\u2019s all it would take me to get you in my bed.\u201d</p><p>Ellie could feel all her resolve melting away. She tilted her head and closed her eyes. His mouth brushed hers.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a good idea,\u201d she said. Her voice was so faint, it was barely audible.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said as he circled her mouth with gentle kisses.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here because of your job, and we shouldn\u2019t let anything interfere,\u201d she whispered breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d His lips moved to her earlobe.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d he said as he nibbled on her ear.</p><p>It took every last ounce of willpower to slowly pull away, but Ellie gently pushed against his chest and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she said.</p><p>She walked into her room. Closing the door was the hardest thing she had ever done in her life.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>Her bedroom felt like an inferno. She looked all over the room, even behind the bed and underneath it, but couldn\u2019t find any vents. Who had her father used to install the heating and cooling system in these rooms? she wondered. Whoever it was obviously gave him a deal he couldn\u2019t resist.</p><p>Ellie opened the door and felt a rush of cold air. She noticed Max\u2019s bedroom door was also open, and she wondered if the only vents in the apartment were the two in the tiny hallway.</p><p>She quietly got back in bed and was sound asleep in seconds. An hour later the cold awakened her. She was freezing, and the top sheet and thin blanket couldn\u2019t block the arctic blasts pouring into the room. My God, she could see her breath in the air. For some reason she thought that was hilarious and had to stifle her laughter with her pillow. Exactly what kind of a deal had her father gotten? It must have been a doozy.</p><p>She got out of bed to shut the door and remembered she had left her cell phone in the living room. She found it on the arm of the sofa, plugged it into her charger on the kitchen counter, and, shivering, headed back to bed.</p><p>She turned the corner and came to a quick stop. Max was leaning against the door frame to his bedroom watching her. His hair was tousled, his gaze intense.</p><p>It was impossible not to stare at him. He was so incredibly virile. A perfect specimen, she thought. She took a breath and forgot to let it out. No other man aroused her the way Max did. He was bare-chested and had pulled on a pair of jeans. He hadn\u2019t bothered to zip them, leaving the suggestion that he hadn\u2019t worn anything to bed. Picturing him na*ed made every nerve in her body tingle.</p><p>Another blast of frigid air blew across her face. Rubbing her arms to try to warm her skin, she whispered, \u201cDid I wake you?\u201d</p><p>He lazily moved away from the door and reached for her, gently pulling her into his warm arms. She could have easily stepped back if she had wanted to, but turning away from him was out of the question given her insane need to touch him.</p><p>Heat radiated from his chest, and she sighed against his shoulder as she put her arms around his neck. Even his scent aroused her. And his touch was making her warm all over. His strong hands caressed her back, then moved lower to firmly grasp her hips. His chin rubbed against the top of her head. She leaned back and looked into his eyes, saw the passion there, and knew he wanted her as much as she wanted him.</p><p>Her fingers spread upward into his hair as he lowered his head and kissed her. He wasn\u2019t in any hurry. The kiss was slow. His tongue penetrated and rubbed against hers, and when she imitated the action, he growled low in his throat and deepened the kiss.</p><p>Holding her in his arms, his mouth slanting over hers again and again, Max backed into the bedroom but stopped when he reached the bed. Her mouth was hot, wet, wild under his, and the way she stroked his neck made him crave more. She didn\u2019t resist when he pulled her gown over her head. Her hands got in his way as she tried to push his jeans down. In seconds they were both na*ed and fell into bed together. He rolled over, nudged her thighs apart, and stretched out on top of her.</p><p>Max let out a long, raspy breath. He wanted to savor the moment. He could feel her heart under his as he lifted a strand of hair from the side of her neck and began to kiss her there.</p><p>She moved restlessly against him as he slowly moved down her body, gasping when he began to caress her breasts. His hands moved lower to span her waist then lower still. He kissed her navel, heard her indrawn breath, and knew he pleased her. There was a scar above her right hip. He kissed it, then moved lower to stroke and taste her until she was writhing in his arms and moaning with desire. He lifted up, kissed her again, a scorching kiss with no reservations.</p><p>Ellie pushed him onto his back and began to make love to him. She stroked his shoulders, his arms, marveling at the strength and heat she felt under her fingertips. She kissed every inch of his chest, loving the feel of his coarse hair against her breasts. She stroked his tight stomach with her tongue while her hands moved lower to caress his arousal. He sucked in his breath and shuddered.</p><p>He pulled her up, kissed her once more, then rolled away from her.</p><p>She tried to pull him back.</p><p>\u201cI want to protect you,\u201d he whispered, his voice thick with desire.</p><p>Seconds later, he pressed her onto her back, and shaking with his need now, he spread her thighs, covered her mouth with his, and thrust inside her.</p><p>She cried out and raised her h*ps to take more of him. Max\u2019s head dropped to the crook of her shoulder and he took deep shuddering breaths to try to slow down. Hot liquid heat enveloped him. It was exquisite torture to stay still. She began to move under him, stroked his shoulders, and drove him wild with her uninhibited response. He moved, slowly at first, and then more forcefully until he was burning.</p><p>For the first time in his life, he lost control. He couldn\u2019t slow the pace. She wouldn\u2019t let him. He had absolutely no discipline as he drove into her, trying desperately to give her as much pleasure as she was giving him. Her nails scored his shoulders, and she began to tighten all around him, squeezing him, and as he pushed harder, she cl**axed.</p><p>Ellie said his name in a whisper, then shouted it as sensations unlike anything she had ever experienced before rippled through her.</p><p>His cl**ax followed and was as violent and satisfying. It consumed him, drained him, took every ounce of his strength. With a loud, lusty groan, he collapsed on top of her.</p><p>It took several minutes for both of them to recover. When he was finally able to take a normal breath, he lifted up and looked at her. Passion was still there in her eyes, and her cheeks were flushed from their lovemaking. She was so very beautiful, and he realized he was once again in awe of her.</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cOh yes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>He rolled onto his back. Their bodies were slick with perspiration, but blasts of freezing cold air cooled their skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he said gruffly as he swung his legs over the side of the bed. He glanced over his shoulder at her golden body and then laughed. Ellie was sound asleep.</p><p>He guessed she was right. It was all good.</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>Ellie was unlike any other woman Max had ever known. The women he had taken to his bed usually wanted pillow talk and sometimes praise after sex, or at the very least to be held. Ellie, on the other hand, wanted to sleep.</p><p>An hour later, he made love to her again. He woke her by trailing his fingers down the valley between her br**sts and her navel. He watched her face. Her eyes didn\u2019t open, but she sucked in her breath. Smiling, he leaned down and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cThis time I\u2019m setting the pace,\u201d he told her in a gruff whisper. He tugged on her earlobe with his teeth to get her attention. He was determined to teach her how to relax and take it slow even if it killed him, and it damn near did. If she hadn\u2019t been so responsive, he might have been able to get their lovemaking to last a little longer, but neither one of them could stop their release. She ended up on top of him, and after the tremors left, she put her head on his shoulder and was sound asleep less than a minute later with his arms wrapped around her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They woke up in a sauna. Ellie was sleeping on her side with her head on his shoulder and one leg draped over his. She opened her eyes as Max was trying to gently move her off of him so he could get up. She was instantly wide-awake. She rolled over him and tried to move off the bed. He caught her about her waist and pulled her down for a long kiss. The flash of embarrassment she\u2019d felt waking up with him was gone, and she kissed him back just as thoroughly. Then she got up and went into the bathroom to shower.</p><p>Max went into the kitchen and drank a glass of orange juice while he tried to figure out how to turn the air conditioner down, but the dial on the thermostat wouldn\u2019t move.</p><p>Her dad definitely had been ripped off no matter how much of a discount he\u2019d received. Max wondered how he would react the next time he opened his electric bill. If the wiring was faulty, the thing could be a fire hazard. Max decided, before he and Ellie left for the airport, he should talk to him about it.</p><p>The air came back on while Max was in the shower. Ellie went into the smaller bedroom to get ready. She applied a little makeup and lip gloss, and even put on a skirt to please her mother. It was short, pale blue, and barely wrinkled. Her crisp white blouse was fitted but not too tight.</p> <p>Since she hadn\u2019t slept in the bed, she didn\u2019t change the sheets. She smoothed the covers and then went into Max\u2019s bedroom to strip the bed, but he\u2019d already made it. She wasn\u2019t surprised. She\u2019d noticed what a careful, disciplined man he was when he was working, and that spilled over into his personal habits. His shaving kit was organized, and his shirts were perfectly folded in his bag. Max controlled what he could in his environment. She surmised that the trauma of losing his parents at such an early age had a lot to do with his behavior. It was also probably what made him so good at his job.</p><p>She stared at the bed a long moment as pictures of what they had done the night before flashed before her. She actually blushed as she remembered how enthusiastic she\u2019d been. Max most likely thought she was a sex fiend, and with him, she just might be.</p><p>With a sigh, she went back into the living room. After they had their talk with her father, she\u2019d change the sheets, she decided.</p><p>She drank a Diet Coke for breakfast and was leaning against the counter checking her phone when Max came into the kitchen. He was sliding his gun into his holster at his side. She watched him bring the leather strap over the gun and snap it in place.</p><p>She was suddenly feeling shy again. \u201cI haven\u2019t changed my airline ticket yet,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk to your father first, then worry about getting back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for not fighting me on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtecting you will be easier if you\u2019re in the hospital all day and home the rest of the time. We\u2019ll have more manpower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going back to the hospital permanently,\u201d she replied. Then she added, \u201cMaybe if they\u2019re shorthanded for a little while until...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you find out where Patterson is?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, until I figure out where I want to live and work.\u201d</p> <p>Ellie heard someone calling her name. She was pretty sure it was her father, and she went to the door to open it. She\u2019d unlocked the dead bolt when Max put his hand on top of hers and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t open doors. I do. And I go out first. Understood?\u201d</p><p>She turned around and found herself plastered against the door. His hands were on either side of her.</p><p>\u201cLast night...,\u201d he began.</p><p>He was frowning. Oh no, was he going to tell her it had been a mistake? Or worse, apologize for what happened? She thought she just might kick him if he did.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, trying to ease what she perceived to be guilt. \u201cIt\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>Then she noticed the amusement in his eyes and realized he wasn\u2019t feeling guilty about anything. He kissed her. It was a brief glad-to-see-you-again kind of kiss and definitely unsatisfying.</p><p>\u201cGood? Sweetheart, it was a whole lot better than good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was,\u201d she said, sighing.</p> <p>Just standing this close to him made her weak. She had thought that after making love most of the night, she would have moved past this crazy reaction to him. It didn\u2019t happen. He still could turn her stomach into jelly.</p><p>Had she not been anxious to get the talk with her parents over and done with and be on their way, she would have kissed Max the way she wanted, but she had no intention of starting something she couldn\u2019t finish.</p><p>Her father bellowed her name. She took a deep breath and said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s do this,\u201d and stepped back to let him go outside first, then followed him.</p><p>He made himself a target. Whoever would try to hurt her would have to go through him first.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good at removing bullets,\u201d she whispered. She didn\u2019t know why she needed to give him that inconsequential information. Was she telling him this so he wouldn\u2019t worry? The possibility of him getting injured was too awful to think about.</p><p>\u201cI know you are,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the other surgeons at the hospital told Sean you hit the one hundred mark before your third year of residency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not something I want to be remembered for,\u201d she said. She poked him between his shoulder blades. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare get shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he promised as he looked around.</p><p>Ellie\u2019s parents\u2019 backyard was square, extremely large, perfectly manicured, and surrounded by trees and bushes on all sides, blocking the neighbors\u2019 view. Behind the greenery was a fence, but that, too, was hidden from view. It would be difficult for Cogburn to get a good shot, Max thought. Even if one of the neighbors didn\u2019t notice a stranger cutting through his yard, the fence and the bushes would be a deterrent. No, there were better places to wait for his target. Too many, in fact.</p><p>Her father held the door open for them. \u201cI made waffles,\u201d he announced. \u201cYour mother\u2019s starting the eggs, and the bacon is already on the table getting cold. Didn\u2019t you hear me calling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, Max and I need to talk to you and Mom. It\u2019s important,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cImportant can wait until after breakfast,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut this is-\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleanor, you heard your father. No worrisome talk before breakfast,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cIs that a new rule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Southern rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all right,\u201d she said. \u201cBut directly after breakfast we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Neither parent responded to her demand. \u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, dear. Now eat your breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Ellie wanted only a PowerBar or a piece of toast, but she couldn\u2019t hurt her father\u2019s feelings, and so she ate a little of everything that was offered. Max ate like a man who\u2019d been starving for a week.</p><p>\u201cWant to know the secret to my waffles? Club soda,\u201d her father said proudly. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re so light and fluffy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s an expert on waffles,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cAnd baking bread,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s therapeutic. But that\u2019s all. Waffles and bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well last night?\u201d Claire asked Max.</p><p>The question reminded him about the air conditioner, and he told William that he should call the store where he had purchased the unit and make them replace it.</p><p>\u201cIt was all sales final,\u201d William said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have a repairman over here today. I know just who to call. In the meantime, would you mind helping me disconnect it?\u201d</p><p>Max followed her father outside. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to tell him about the thermostat,\u201d Ellie called.</p><p>He raised his hand to let her know he\u2019d heard her just as the door closed.</p><p>Now that Claire had Ellie alone, she sat down at the table next to her.</p><p>\u201cI see you still drink milk,\u201d she remarked with a smile as Ellie finished her glass.</p><p>She then began to talk about all the wedding arrangements, and in the midst of describing the wedding cake, she burst into tears.</p><p>Ellie was astonished and alarmed. She hadn\u2019t seen her mother cry in years, not since the day she had to leave her with the Wheatleys.</p><p>\u201cMother, stop that,\u201d Ellie demanded. She grabbed a tissue from the box on the shelf and handed it to her. \u201cPlease, stop crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how hard this is for you,\u201d her mother began. She wiped the tears away as she continued. \u201cI wish things were different. It breaks my heart to see you and Ava not getting along. I love all my girls, but I\u2019ll admit that Ava has been a trial for your father and me. She\u2019s so headstrong, and what she did to you was cruel and despicable.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was speechless. She knew her mother loved her, and she also knew she didn\u2019t favor one daughter over the others, but she had never expressed strong feelings about what happened between the two sisters until today.</p><p>\u201cAva knows how her father and I feel. After you left so abruptly-and who could blame you-we got into quite an argument. You were so devastated and destroyed by the betrayal.\u201d</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t, Ellie admitted to herself. She was neither devastated nor destroyed. She was furious and humiliated, but there hadn\u2019t been any heartbreak.</p><p>\u201cAva said it wasn\u2019t deliberate, that there was this instant attraction between the two of them. That does happen.\u201d</p><p>Yes, it does, Ellie agreed as she replayed her initial reaction to meeting Max. There had definitely been an instant attraction, and it seemed to be getting stronger.</p><p>\u201cThen she should have come to me and told me instead of jumping into bed with him,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>\u201cYes, she should have,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want excuses, and I understand that, but Eleanor, we have to find a way to get past this. Ava\u2019s going to marry John a week from Saturday, no matter how any of us feel. She loves him, and he loves her. Please try to be all right with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mom. I\u2019ll try. Now please, stop crying,\u201d she pleaded as she handed her mother another tissue.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to hear about the preparations for the garden party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat garden party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get your invitation?\u201d</p><p>Ellie shook her head. \u201cMaybe,\u201d she said then. \u201cThere was a lot of mail piled up. I paid the bills, but I didn\u2019t have time to go through all the rest...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie\u2019s giving a garden party here Saturday evening for Ava. It\u2019s going to be lovely. Annie\u2019s taken care of all the preparations long distance, if you can imagine. Of course, Ava insisted that she approve every choice. There will be about eighty people here, maybe more.\u201d</p><p>Ellie continued to listen while her mother talked about all the difficulties with the planning and how nervous and demanding Ava had been to have everything just so.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not paying for this wedding, are you, Mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she rushed. \u201cAva and John are paying for everything.\u201d</p><p>Ellie didn\u2019t think she was telling the full truth, but she didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>\u201cAva\u2019s done most of the work. It\u2019s just been very stressful. I\u2019ll be so thankful when this is over.\u201d</p><p>Max walked in with her father but stopped when he saw Ellie\u2019s mother dabbing at her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou told her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ellie was shaking her head. \u201cNot a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d her mother asked, the worry already creeping back into her eyes.</p><p>Ellie braced herself for the battle ahead. \u201cSomething\u2019s happened, and we have to leave. I didn\u2019t think it was necessary for Max to tell you because we wouldn\u2019t be here, but he insisted, said it was important that you know and I...\u201d She realized she was rambling and forced herself to stop.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>\u201cMax, why don\u2019t you explain.\u201d</p><p>Max pulled out a chair next to Ellie, sat, and quickly told them about the Landry case and the shooting of Sean Goodman. The rest of the account took only fifteen minutes, but for the next hour Ellie tried to calm them down.</p><p>\u201cBut if you\u2019re not a witness and you can\u2019t identify these terrible people, why would they send someone to harm you?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t take chances,\u201d Max explained. \u201cAnd they have their ways of finding out who potential witnesses are. She and Sean saw them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were both wearing disguises, you said,\u201d William said.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad, they were. I really couldn\u2019t identify them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do, William? I don\u2019t want to let Ellie out of my sight. I want to keep her locked up in the house until they catch that man, but I know I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>Figure something out? \u201cDad, unless you want a plus two at the wedding, Max and I need to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat plus two?\u201d her mother asked, not understanding.</p><p>Max understood. He put his arm around the back of Ellie\u2019s chair and gently tugged on her hair. Plus two would be Max and the hired killer. Not funny.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been accused of ruining several of Ava\u2019s parties, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll appreciate someone shooting up the church during the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my Lord, don\u2019t talk like that,\u201d her father said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting everyone in danger staying here. I do wish I could stay for a little while. I haven\u2019t seen Annie in over three years. And all the aunts and uncles will be here, some I haven\u2019t seen since I was a little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous for you,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI so wanted you to attend the garden party, though. Annie\u2019s going to be disappointed. The whole family would be together, and that hasn\u2019t happened in years, has it, William?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, please don\u2019t tell Annie or Ava the real reason I had to leave. Make up an excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow safe is my daughter going to be back in her apartment?\u201d her father asked Max. \u201cStrangers stick out here, but not in the big city.\u201d His face was getting red with anger, for it was all sinking in.</p><p>\u201cThere will be more agents and police to watch over her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Max? Are you going to keep my daughter safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, I am. I\u2019m not going to let anyone hurt her.\u201d It was a promise he would die to keep.</p><p>\u201cThen you aren\u2019t her friend, Max?\u201d her mother asked. \u201cYou\u2019re here to protect her?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI\u2019m both.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know you care about Ellie. I can see it in your eyes,\u201d her father said. \u201cWill that interfere with your ability to do your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice was emphatic.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention that the garden party is in our backyard?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>Ellie could see how rattled she was. \u201cYes, you did mention it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy Saturday there will be large planters at each end of the yard and flowers galore all along the borders. The nursery will be here tomorrow morning to do the planting. There will be fullblown flowers in every imaginable color. Oh, and at the end of the yard will be a pristine white tent with tables covered in white linen cloths and covered chairs for those who don\u2019t want to stand. There will be music, too, a violin. I\u2019ll take lots of pictures to send you, Ellie, so you won\u2019t feel excluded.\u201d Tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p>None of this was her fault, but Ellie still felt guilty and responsible for her parents\u2019 pain. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Seeing the disappointment on his wife\u2019s face, Ellie\u2019s father turned to Max. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you two stay until after the party Saturday? You could make it safe. If Ellie stayed in the house or in the tent during the party, and if we could get someone else to help with security, wouldn\u2019t it be possible?\u201d</p><p>Her parents were looking eager and hopeful. Ellie knew how important it was to her mother that she stay, and she didn\u2019t want to disappoint her, but Ellie had to be realistic. Others could get hurt.</p><p>\u201cIt could be dangerous for you and your guests if I stay,\u201d she warned.</p> <p>\u201cI know we can make it safe,\u201d her father insisted. \u201cEven if we have to hire security here. You\u2019ve got that man\u2019s picture, so we\u2019d know who we\u2019re looking for...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandry could have hired someone else,\u201d Max said.</p><p>Claire looked hopeful. \u201cBut like William said, everyone knows everyone else around here. A stranger would stick out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven a cable guy or a repairman? Would you look twice?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cI know the repairman I\u2019m going to call to fix the air conditioner,\u201d William said. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t let any other repairmen near here until the party\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows you\u2019re home, Ellie,\u201d her mother said. \u201cBecause none of us were certain you\u2019d be able to get away. I only told the relatives that you were going to try to get home but that your schedule was difficult. We\u2019ll keep it a secret until the party. I\u2019ll tell Ava and Annie to keep it low-key, too, and not mention you.\u201d</p> <p>The parents had a plan now and looked at Max for approval. When he didn\u2019t immediately agree, Claire asked, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Ellie couldn\u2019t break their hearts. She made up her mind that if Max told her no, that she had to leave, she would pull rank and simply say that she was staying.</p><p>Max\u2019s cell phone vibrated, telling him he had a text. He pushed the chair back and stood. \u201cLet me talk to some people and see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s mother clasped her hands together, and her father smiled. \u201cGood, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Max put one hand up. \u201cI\u2019m not promising anything. If I don\u2019t get the people I want, then Ellie and I are leaving. You\u2019ll have to accept that. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d her father said as her mother nodded.</p><p>\u201cI really think I should stay for the party...,\u201d Ellie began.</p><p>The look Max shot her suggested she not continue. If she thought she could show a little independence and throw her weight around with the I-can-do-whatever-I-want attitude, she was sadly mistaken.</p> <p>Ellie stood up, thinking that she and Max should have their disagreement in another room so her parents wouldn\u2019t hear them, but Max didn\u2019t seem to care who heard what he had to say.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you don\u2019t make the decision. I do. And where I go, you go.\u201d</p><p>He excused himself and went into the living room to read his text and respond.</p><p>Ellie decided to clean the kitchen while her mother went in search of her good Irish linens. She\u2019d packed them away in the attic when the hardwood floors were being refinished.</p><p>Ellie had just started the dishwasher when she got a call from Carlos Garcia\u2019s wife, Jennifer. The woman was hesitant and sounded fearful over the phone.</p><p>\u201cWe met at the police station, and my husband, Carlos, had a mole on his neck...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember, Jennifer. How is everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem, and you told me to call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the doctor\u2019s building next to the hospital, but the doctor\u2019s reception lady says we don\u2019t have insurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the doctor in the office now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I heard him talk to a patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, good. Could you give me the number for that office?\u201d</p><p>A minute later Ellie had the number written down. \u201cSit tight for a few minutes, and I promise you Carlos will see the doctor today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dr. Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Jennifer, and please call me if there are any other problems.\u201d</p><p>Then Ellie dialed the doctor\u2019s office. Max walked into the kitchen just as she ripped into the receptionist, who had identified herself as Michelle.</p><p>\u201cThis is Dr. Sullivan. You knew that Carlos Garcia was scheduled to see Dr. Shultz today. I set that up before I left town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t tell us he didn\u2019t have insurance.\u201d Michelle sounded snippy.</p><p>\u201cDr. Shultz is doing the surgery free of charge,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe must not have remembered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t do free surgeries.\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s voice turned to steel. \u201cYou get him on the phone, and if he\u2019s too busy, tell him I\u2019m going to get Dr. Westfield on the line, and Shultz can explain the little surgery he did on his girlfriend three months ago. Oh, wait. You\u2019re the girlfriend, aren\u2019t you, Michelle? Why don\u2019t we get Shultz\u2019s wife on the line, too. We\u2019ll do a nice little conference call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting him. I\u2019m getting him.\u201d</p><p>Shultz was on the phone a minute later, and he was hopping mad. \u201cI\u2019m swamped today. I don\u2019t have time for any charity cases. You don\u2019t even know this man. Didn\u2019t you tell me you met him at the police station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did meet Carlos at the police station, and that\u2019s when I noticed the mole. You gave me your word you\u2019d do the surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m going to the hospital board, and I swear to you your privileges will be revoked by the end of next week. That\u2019s when I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going to the state board and file a complaint,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd, of course, I\u2019m going to have a nice chat with your wife-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. I know I promised...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are required by the hospital to do a certain number of surgeries without compensation, and I know for a fact you haven\u2019t done any. I\u2019ll be sure to mention that to Westfield, too. When I\u2019m done with you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, you\u2019ve made your point. I\u2019ll see your patient as soon as I get off the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen up,\u201d she said. \u201cYou treat him and his family like they\u2019re my closest friends. I better not hear you screwed up.\u201d</p><p>Max had heard the entire conversation. He remembered that Ben had told him how she had talked to a man at the police station but had refused to explain what it was all about. Now he knew what she was doing for him.</p><p>Ellie ended the call muttering, \u201cBig jerk.\u201d Then she noticed Max watching her. He was smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. He walked over and lifted her chin to give her a kiss.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJust because,\u201d he answered. He took a seat next to her. \u201cI\u2019ve got some news from Ben,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCal and Erika Landry just walked into the FBI office with their attorneys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonolulu.\u201d</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>Ellie was going stir-crazy, desperate to get out of the house for a little while. Max had disappeared into William\u2019s home office and was making calls on his cell phone, so she tried to keep busy and not interrupt him. She came across her father, who was searching through the kitchen and hearth room for his car keys.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLipton,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe only thermostat available for the new air conditioner is at Waid\u2019s Hardware Store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Waid\u2019s Hardware Store here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re out, which is why I\u2019m driving all the way to Lipton now. They won\u2019t be charging me for the new thermostat, since the first one was faulty, but if you and Max want air-conditioning tonight, I\u2019ve got to get over there and back lickety-split.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax and I will go,\u201d she offered.</p><p>Shaking his head, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for you to go out. Besides, Max has done enough. If he hadn\u2019t talked to the owner of the appliance store, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten a new air conditioner. I think he scared them into doing the right thing. Eighty percent off broken is still broken, right? It isn\u2019t legal to sell something you know doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I did.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was pleased with Max. She hadn\u2019t known that he had done that for her father.</p><p>\u201cIt would be a big help if someone could go to Lipton for me,\u201d William admitted. He thought for a few seconds and said, \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t need the thermostat until four. That would give us time to install it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said you had to get back lickety-split.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the air conditioner is going to be delivered, and I\u2019ve got to sign for the fountain and all the rest of the things your sister ordered for the garden party. Someone has to be here to direct where everything goes, and your mother is going to get her hair done and her nails and God knows what else. Pots today, more plantings tomorrow, and fresh flowers Saturday morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t Ava and Annie help while Max and I go pick up the thermostat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva can\u2019t leave her store... oops, I mean her boutique. She hates it when I call it a store. And Annie won\u2019t get in until late afternoon. Besides, there\u2019s no reason for anyone to help me. All I have to do is sign and point to where I want the pots.\u201d He smiled as he added, \u201cAva drew me a diagram. And while I\u2019m waiting, I\u2019ll get some paperwork done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll go get Max now, and we\u2019ll leave right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleanor, you\u2019re jumping the gun. Max agreed to let you stay here if he could get extra protection, remember? Are you sure he\u2019s going to let you remain in Winston Falls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go ask him now.\u201d</p><p>She went down the hall to her father\u2019s office. Max was sitting at the desk talking on the phone. She stood in the doorway waiting for him to notice her. When he motioned to her, she walked over and leaned against the desk facing him.</p><p>\u201cOkay then, and thanks. I really appreciate this,\u201d he said and disconnected the call. He looked up at Ellie. \u201cI\u2019ve got two agents until Saturday. Both of them are coming from Columbia. They\u2019ll be here tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgents Clark and Hershey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t those candy bars?\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t let them hear you say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we can stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil your yard-party thing is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarden party,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>He noticed a frown cross her face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m concerned about two agents showing up suddenly. Won\u2019t they be hard to explain? Everyone at the party will wonder who they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know how to blend in,\u201d Max assured her. \u201cBut I\u2019ll meet with them ahead of time, and we\u2019ll work out a game plan.\u201d</p><p>Her frown had eased a little, but Max could tell she was still thinking about possible problems. He tilted his head toward the desk. \u201cSee that new book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe big one. It\u2019s your dad\u2019s new math book. He can\u2019t wait for you to work the problems.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders slumped. \u201cI hate math,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He grabbed her and pulled her onto his lap. \u201cI saw how you grimaced when he was telling the story about the visiting professor. Why didn\u2019t you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved doing math with me, and I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings.\u201d</p><p>He slipped his arm around her waist. She pushed his hand away as she stood. \u201cMy father is in the next room,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTell me what Ben said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen is going to sit in on the interview with Cal Landry. When he\u2019s finished with him, he\u2019ll tackle his wife, Erika.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one is the weak link?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNeither one,\u201d he answered. \u201cThey\u2019re both hard as\u201d-he started to say a crude word but substituted-\u201cnails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave they said where they\u2019ve been? Or did they admit they were there at the park?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cThey insisted they\u2019ve been on their yacht, cruising from island to island. They have several witnesses who will vouch for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they know about the eyewitness? Greg...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg Roper,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cAnd no, not yet. We\u2019re keeping quiet about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, can you go?\u201d Her father poked his head into the library.</p><p>\u201cGo where?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>She quickly explained she\u2019d offered to pick up the new thermostat. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day, and I really would like to get out.\u201d</p><p>Max didn\u2019t have any problem leaving as long as she didn\u2019t take any chances and listened to what he said.</p><p>They were on their way minutes later. Ellie grabbed a bottle of water from the refrigerator on the way out the door, tossed her purse on the floor of Max\u2019s SUV, and put her cell phone next to his in the cup holder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her father knocked on her window, and when she rolled it down, he said, \u201cYou remember how to get to 26, don\u2019t you? If you pass the exit for Mays Hill, you\u2019ve gone too far. You might want to cut over on 223, then turn back on 168. That will take you right into the north side of Lipton. It shouldn\u2019t take you more than an hour to get there. Stop at the Goose for lunch,\u201d he added. \u201cGreat food.\u201d</p><p>Max drove down the street, turned left, and then said, \u201cDid you get any of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirections?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, directions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have asked...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where Highway 26 is,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cI can get you that far.\u201d</p><p>Max programmed the GPS to locate Lipton, and they were on their way. It was a pretty day, but the heat was rising. Ellie wished she could roll all the windows down, but she knew the humidity would make her miserable in no time at all.</p><p>She checked the weather app on her phone. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be in the mid-eighties,\u201d she said. \u201cSeems hotter to me.\u201d</p> <p>A half hour into the trip, the GPS indicated that they should turn off at the next exit and that Lipton was just twelve miles ahead. Max took the turn and said, \u201cWhy did your dad make it so complicated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t know about this exit.\u201d</p><p>They drove for a couple of miles on a two-lane road, and the GPS gave them another order to take a left at the next intersection. Fifteen minutes later, they were bumping along a dirt road with few signs of habitation in view. The GPS announced that it was recalculating the route, and Max looked as though he wanted to empty his gun into it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should have paid attention to Dad,\u201d Ellie said. She could have sworn she saw Max\u2019s jaw flinch as he turned the SUV around on the narrow road and headed back in the direction from which they had just come.</p><p>Several miles and several turns later, they ended up on a road lined with construction signs but no construction equipment or workers.</p><p>\u201cIs anyone following us?\u201d she asked with a straight face.</p> <p>They hadn\u2019t seen a single car or person in the past half hour.</p><p>Max was trying to turn the car around without sinking a tire in one of the multitude of holes.</p><p>\u201cNot funny,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re out in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>He picked up her bottle of water, took a swig, and handed it over to her. He finally got the SUV turned around, and they backtracked to a somewhat decent two-lane road. It took another half hour before they found 168. Ellie wanted to laugh, but she didn\u2019t dare, so she rode in silence the rest of the way.</p><p>As they finally passed the sign proclaiming they had arrived in Lipton, Max grumbled, \u201cDamn GPS.\u201d</p><p>Ellie couldn\u2019t help herself. She burst into peals of laughter.</p><p>Other than giving her a vexed look, Max didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>He slowed the car as they pulled into the town, which was tiny and quaint. There was a main street two blocks long with shops lined up on both sides. Cars were parked in front of most of them. Toward one end of the street was the hardware store, and at the other end was the Goose restaurant. Max noticed the first storefront they passed had SHERIFF\u2019S DEPARTMENT etched on the glass above the door.</p> <p>He stopped the car in front of Waid\u2019s Hardware Store, and they walked inside. Odors of leather and wood shavings and paint and engine oil greeted them. The old hardwood floors creaked when they stepped on them. A man wearing a carpenter\u2019s apron stood behind the counter waiting on two young men. As Max and Ellie entered, they all turned toward the door, raising their eyebrows when they saw the strangers.</p><p>Ellie assumed they had noticed the gun at Max\u2019s side. Max knew they were all noticing her.</p><p>After finishing his transaction with the two men, the clerk addressed them. \u201cI know what you\u2019re here for,\u201d he said as he pulled the thermostat from a shelf behind the counter. He dropped it in a paper bag and handed it to Ellie.</p><p>Back outside, Max locked it in the car, and they headed down the street to the restaurant.</p><p>A cartoon caricature of a goose, who apparently was a close cousin to Donald Duck, was painted on the large front window of the establishment. It was a narrow space with a cash register at the front door and red vinyl booths along the walls. The lunch crowd filled most of the seats. Max spotted an empty booth toward the back, and they were heading for it when Ellie stopped suddenly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said.</p><p>Max looked over at her. She was standing dead still and staring wide-eyed. When he turned back to see what had caught her attention, he saw a tall, burly man walking toward them. He wore a baseball cap with the word SHERIFF embroidered above the brim.</p><p>Ellie ran to him and threw herself into his arms.</p><p>Max was right behind her. He wanted to peel her off the sheriff but decided on diplomacy first.</p><p>\u201cLet go of him,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>She ignored him. \u201cOh my God. I knew you\u2019d either end up running from the law or becoming the law. I\u2019m so happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>A huge smile spread across the man\u2019s face. \u201cEllie Sullivan. Where have you been?\u201d</p><p>She finally let go of him and introduced him to Max. \u201cThis is Spike Bennett... Sheriff Spike Bennett,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cYou sure grew up nice,\u201d Spike said.</p><p>They were standing in the aisle, and a waitress was patiently waiting to get past. Ellie slid into a booth, and Max sat beside her across from the sheriff.</p><p>If Spike hadn\u2019t been wearing any identification, Max would have thought there was a possibility he\u2019d just been paroled from prison. Both his arms were covered with tattoos, and there were a couple of scars near his elbows. A larger scar ran from his hairline down to his right eyebrow. It made him look dangerous.</p><p>His affection for Ellie was apparent.</p><p>\u201cHow do you two know each other?\u201d Max inquired.</p><p>\u201cWe were in school together,\u201d Spike said. \u201cAre you married, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Max had the insane urge to put his arm around her shoulders and haul her into his side. Was he trying to mark his territory? Jeez, he was acting like a caveman.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? Are you married?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, two years now,\u201d he answered. \u201cI met my wife in college,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019d like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I would,\u201d she said. Turning to Max, she said softly, \u201cSpike saved me from Patterson. That\u2019s how he got the scar on his forehead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Max said to Spike.</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it was,\u201d Spike agreed, \u201cbut I remember every minute of it as though it happened yesterday. It was lunch hour, and I was hiding behind that big oak tree by the chapel. Remember that tree, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cKenny Platte climbed it and fell. He broke his arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you hiding?\u201d Max asked, curious.</p><p>Spike grinned. \u201cI was trying to get the matches to work to light a cigarette I had stolen from my uncle. I had a plan. Once I got it lit, I was going to stroll past the principal\u2019s office puffing away. I figured smoking would get me kicked out of school no matter how much money my father had. The matches were wet, though, and I never did get the cigarette lit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpike had a bad-boy image to keep up,\u201d Ellie explained.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it took work,\u201d he admitted. \u201cSo there I was behind that tree when I heard you screaming. I ran around the corner to see what was happening, and Patterson was trying to drag you away.\u201d Turning to Max, he said, \u201cThe guy was built like a bull, and was at least six feet. By the time I got to him, he was on top of Ellie, using his fists. She was curled up in a ball on her side, so her shoulders and her legs took most of the beating. Sister Mary Frances tried to pull him off, but he knocked her down and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hit Sister Mary Frances?\u201d Ellie was appalled.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI just remember you jumping on top of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I did get him off of you, and I shouted for you to run, but you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I could help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was crazy,\u201d Spike said. \u201cSoaking wet, you probably weighed fifty pounds back then,\u201d he exaggerated. \u201cAnd it all happened so fast. I got in a couple of good punches, but Patterson shook those hits off like a dog shaking water off, so I decided to choke him. I was squeezing his neck for all I was worth, but it didn\u2019t faze him. To this day, I\u2019ll never forget the look in his eyes. Not crazy eyes,\u201d he stressed. \u201cEvil... mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he cut you with?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>Spike touched the scar on his forehead. \u201cA penknife. It was on his key chain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou became my hero that day,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>His neck turned pink. \u201cI\u2019m no hero. I just got to him before anyone else could. It took three big seniors to pull him off me and pin him down until the police arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both went to the hospital,\u201d Ellie interjected. \u201cSister Mary Frances rode in the ambulance with you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe nuns called me the town terror, and if it hadn\u2019t been for my dad\u2019s donations to the school, they would have thrown me out, but after that day, they all but sainted me.\u201d He laughed and said, \u201cMy bad-boy image was ruined.\u201d</p><p>He turned serious again, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Patterson\u2019s record, and I can\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t end up in prison. Any one of his assaults should have been enough to lock him away, but it looks as though he had some pretty shrewd attorneys who convinced the court he needed treatment not incarceration.\u201d He looked at Ellie with genuine compassion. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry for what happened to you. Your dad did everything right with the restraining orders, but I know Patterson didn\u2019t stop. After he kidnapped you and nearly killed you, we heard you were in critical condition and they airlifted you to Harrisburg. My dad promised he\u2019d take me to see you as soon as you were awake, but you disappeared. No one knew where you were.\u201d</p><p>The waitress interrupted to give them menus, but talk of Patterson had soured Ellie\u2019s appetite. She ordered a salad. Max looked over the offerings and decided on the specialty of the house, the Paul Bunyan. The menu boasted it was the largest barbecue beef sandwich in the state. Ellie decided she didn\u2019t have to worry about Max\u2019s dangerous profession. Cholesterol would get him before any bullets did.</p><p>\u201cThere was talk that you\u2019d moved in with a relative in Los Angeles and you had become an actress,\u201d Spike continued. \u201cBut years later I heard you were an attorney in Miami. There was even a rumor floating around not too long ago that you were working on the space shuttle in Houston.\u201d</p><p>The waitress smiled at Spike as she placed three iced teas on the table. He nodded to her and took a drink.</p><p>\u201cYour dad was smart to hide you from that lunatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where Patterson is now?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve got a couple of suspicions, but nothing concrete. He got out of the last institution about six months ago, and then he up and vanished. His parents swear they don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. I wanted to know if I could expect more trouble. My concern was that he\u2019d latch onto another girl or try to hurt someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis parents still live in Winston Falls?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, they do. In the same house.\u201d</p><p>Ellie got goose bumps and leaned into Max\u2019s side. \u201cFour blocks over and three down from my house,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how far away he was. Is he wanted for anything now? Was he supposed to report in to anyone?\u201d</p><p>Spike shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s not wanted for anything, and no one\u2019s looking for him-at least not officially. When he was released, it was recommended that he continue his therapy. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d He sighed as he added, \u201cEveryone thinks he\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve read and heard, when it comes to Ellie, he\u2019s certifiable.\u201d Max made the comment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that. She\u2019d been in the same school, but he hadn\u2019t paid any attention to her until they were at a science camp together. He saw her there, and he instantly wanted her. The fact that she was only eleven years old didn\u2019t matter to him. He couldn\u2019t let her go. And he certainly couldn\u2019t accept rejection. I believe that, if he saw her today, he would attack her.\u201d</p><p>Max handed Spike one of his cards. \u201cIf you hear anything about him, please contact me. Day or night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll do the same,\u201d Spike said, giving Max one of his cards. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching the Patterson house whenever I get over that way. It\u2019s a big Victorian house, and I swear one afternoon I saw the curtains move in the third-story attic dormer. I had seen Patterson\u2019s parents leave a few minutes before, so it couldn\u2019t have been them up there. A couple of kids were walking past his house, and I happened to be at a stop sign adjacent to the street. No one in the house could have seen me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he might be hiding in the attic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he allowed. \u201cKeep in mind, Patterson\u2019s parents insist they haven\u2019t seen Evan, and the father threatened to bring harassment charges if I kept bothering them. I did a little experiment, though. Several times during the last month of school I made a point to watch the house just about three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. Kids walk past the Pattersons\u2019 house every day. I saw the curtains move once more. Just once more, though. So, yeah, it could be him hiding up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiving in a house for six months and never going out, never being seen?\u201d Ellie said. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another problem you should know about,\u201d Max said, and for the next ten minutes he talked about the Landrys and the shooting Ellie had witnessed.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be Willis Cogburn coming after her,\u201d Max said. \u201cI have to consider the possibility that the Landrys could send someone else, but they like working with Cogburn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been in prison, so he\u2019s in the system. I\u2019ll pull up his photo when I get back to the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your cell phone number?\u201d Max asked. \u201cI\u2019ll send the photo to you now.\u201d</p><p>Less than a minute later, Spike was looking at Cogburn\u2019s face. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to get Ellie out of here today, but there\u2019s this party...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents pleaded that I stay for Ava\u2019s garden party,\u201d Ellie explained. \u201cIf Max can make it safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help you with that,\u201d Spike said. Turning to Ellie, he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t catch a break, can you?\u201d</p><p>Trying to stay positive, she said, \u201cEveryone has their ups and downs...\u201d She stopped when she noticed their incredulous expressions. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, shrugging.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk strategy later,\u201d Max suggested after seeing how pale Ellie\u2019s face had become. He knew this had to be difficult for her, but she was handling it with courage.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t want to talk about the Landrys or Patterson any longer and asked Spike to catch her up on all the people she remembered. By the time their food arrived, her appetite was coming back.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Ellie? What are you doing these days?\u201d Spike asked.</p><p>\u201cLooking for a job,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cWould you ever consider moving back here?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if Patterson was living somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven then. All my memories revolve around him. I just don\u2019t think I could do it. What about you?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat made you decide on law enforcement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I helped you, I kinda liked doing some good, I guess, and after college I decided this is what I wanted to do and this is where I wanted to live.\u201d</p><p>Spike asked a few personal questions about her life away from Winston Falls, but Max wouldn\u2019t let her answer. He was smooth about it. He skillfully deflected the questions or changed the subject. Ellie realized what he was doing when he put his hand on her knee.</p><p>When they were once again in the car and on their way back to Winston Falls, Ellie said, \u201cI noticed you wouldn\u2019t let me tell Spike about where I live or what I\u2019m doing. I do trust him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, but how much do you want to bet he\u2019ll go home and tell his wife about running into you, and she might tell a neighbor...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad went to a lot of trouble and expense to hide you until you were old enough to take care of yourself. None of the people here know where you live, do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cNot even the relatives know much about me, only that I was sent away to school after I got out of the hospital. They don\u2019t ask questions, though, which is good. At least that\u2019s what my mother told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them know you\u2019re a surgeon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. My aunt Vivien thinks I\u2019m a perpetual student. Her sister thinks I\u2019m still in school because I\u2019m slow.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t do anything slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a criticism?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered, glancing at her. She looked disgruntled, which amused him. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know how to relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that your full-time work at St. Vincent\u2019s is over, you\u2019ve got all the time in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I mention I owe around two hundred thousand dollars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could still take some time off.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t disagree.</p><p>Her father was in the backyard with the repairman when they arrived home. The huge space had been transformed into a construction site while they were gone. Empty flowerpots lined the porch and were scattered around at strategic spots on the lawn. A large fountain was being erected in the center. Max handed William the thermostat and stood talking to the two men while Ellie went on into the house. She noticed that some of the flowers had been delivered early. There were bouquets on the kitchen table and more in the living room on the sofa table. The arrangements, white hydrangeas and white roses mixed with vivid green leaves, were simple but elegant.</p><p>The dining room table was set for dinner. Seven table settings. She knew what that meant, and she immediately tried to think of somewhere she and Max needed to be. She would go to any lengths not to have to sit next to Ava or John. The problem was, she couldn\u2019t think of anything.</p><p>Her stomach felt a little nauseous, so she poured herself a glass of milk and leaned against the kitchen sink drinking it.</p><p>Max walked in, took one look at her, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Was it that obvious that she was irritated?</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. Just wanted some milk.\u201d</p><p>When her mother entered the kitchen, Ellie noticed she was dressed for a special occasion, wearing a white sleeveless sheath and heels. \u201cIs that a new dress?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve had it a couple of years. You just haven\u2019t seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty,\u201d she said. \u201cYou look nice, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, dear. Now, Ellie,\u201d she said, \u201cthere\u2019s something I want to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Ellie finished her milk. Putting her glass in the sink, she said, \u201cOh God, here we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever you start a sentence with \u2018Now, Ellie,\u2019 I know you\u2019re going to tell me something I don\u2019t want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister Ava and her fianc\u00e9 are coming over for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was right. I didn\u2019t want to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re picking up Annie at the airport and should be here around six thirty.\u201d</p><p>Ellie turned to Max. \u201cYou\u2019ll love Annie. Growing up, she had the nickname Candy Annie because she was so sweet.\u201d</p><p>Her father had come into the kitchen in time to hear Ellie\u2019s remarks. He shook his head. \u201cUntil you went away,\u201d he said. He took a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his brow, then dropped into a chair to catch his breath before continuing. \u201cAnnie became withdrawn, and it took her a long time to recover, and that\u2019s when she decided she wanted to do something in law enforcement when she grew up. She couldn\u2019t understand why Patterson hadn\u2019t been locked up for life. Frankly, neither could we.\u201d He added, \u201cShe felt so helpless.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. Helpless. He could identify with Annie\u2019s mindset. When he was a young boy, he\u2019d felt the same way after he\u2019d run away from foster parents.</p><p>\u201cAnnie\u2019s still sweet,\u201d Ellie insisted. \u201cWe text each other all the time. She\u2019s still got a wicked sense of humor, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Ava?\u201d Max asked. \u201cDid she have a nickname?\u201d</p><p>He mother tried to stop Ellie from answering. \u201cThey\u2019re twins, you know. Identical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are times I still can\u2019t tell them apart,\u201d her father exaggerated.</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cAva\u2019s eyes glow red in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d her mother muttered.</p><p>Her father decided to ignore the comment. \u201cThe repairman installed a window unit because he said the replacement air conditioner was missing a few parts. He\u2019ll be back tomorrow to fix it and put in the new thermostat. I\u2019m going to keep the window unit, though. I got a real deal on it.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang, and her mother hurried to answer. She crossed back through the kitchen saying, \u201cWilliam, tell the tent people where they can set it up.\u201d</p><p>Her father was slow to get up, and after the two of them had gone into the yard, Ellie said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She ran into her parents\u2019 bathroom and went through the medicines in the cabinet. Her father\u2019s color was much better than it had been, but she was concerned about him. Stress could be a killer. She was looking for heart medicine but didn\u2019t find any. The only prescribed medication she found was a bottle of sleeping pills. She read the label and unscrewed the cap. About half the pills were gone. She knew these were nothing to worry about, but she was troubled nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d Max asked when she returned. He was standing at the window in the living room looking out at the street.</p><p>\u201cI was checking out the prescription bottles in the medicine cabinet to find out what they\u2019re taking. If something was wrong with either one of them, I would never know. They wouldn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping pills for my dad,\u201d she answered. \u201cI think the anxiety I\u2019ve caused him over the years-not to mention all the stress of Ava\u2019s wedding-has taken its toll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me about Ava? I sense a little hostility.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re an FBI agent. You\u2019re so perceptive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason for sarcasm.\u201d</p><p>She crossed the room and stood beside him looking out at the street with her arms folded. \u201cI\u2019m here to attend Ava\u2019s wedding because my mother insisted. Really insisted,\u201d she stressed emphatically.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s marrying John Noble, my ex-fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn had only just asked me to marry him a few days before I brought him home to meet the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said when she hesitated.</p><p>\u201cEveryone wanted to make him feel at home... especially Ava.\u201d</p><p>Max suspected where this was headed and waited to hear her tell him.</p><p>\u201cThe night after we arrived, I found him in bed with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she said, \u201cAh, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you blame him for what happened, or do you just blame your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva knew what she was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, he did,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Ava and I always had a contentious relationship, and this was the last straw. I packed up and went back to St. Louis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat had made it so contentious?\u201d he asked, curious.</p><p>\u201cWhen we were young and anything went wrong, Ava blamed me. She and Annie each had her own birthday party, and Ava accused me of ruining one of hers. In a way, I guess I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you ruin it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was beaten and unconscious,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd my parents had to go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was when you were taken away from Winston Falls, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not that time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Ellie, how many times did Patterson send you to the hospital? The court records didn\u2019t tell that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a couple.\u201d</p><p>She tried to act blas\u00e9 about it, but he knew talking about the bastard made her anxious. He could hear it in her voice.</p><p>\u201cIs it difficult to be here, even though it\u2019s just for a couple of days?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t see any reason to lie. \u201cI get this stone in the pit of my stomach, and it doesn\u2019t go away until I\u2019m out of here, all because of him. I used to think it was odd that he didn\u2019t try to find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it would have been all that difficult to find out where I was. I took the Wheatley name for a long time, but I went back to my name for my M.D. A psychiatrist suggested to me that Patterson\u2019s obsession was somehow tied to Winston Falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he allowed, though he wasn\u2019t convinced.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor said that part of Patterson\u2019s obsession or fantasy was that he had to kill me here. It\u2019s one theory,\u201d she added with a shrug.</p><p>Max had another theory. A man with a violent obsession would stop at nothing to get his victim, and the only reason he hadn\u2019t killed Ellie was because he couldn\u2019t find her. From what he\u2019d read in the file, he also knew that Patterson would never stop until he was locked away for life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about him anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, tell me about this Noble guy. Did you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looked good on paper.\u201d</p><p>Max laughed. \u201cIn other words, no,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat exactly does looking good on paper mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn\u2019s a dermatologist, so there\u2019s very little chance of danger in his job. That made him safe.\u201d And God knows, I\u2019d love to find out what it\u2019s like to feel safe, she thought to herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were both residents, so we had the hospital and medicine in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was extremely polite and easygoing.\u201d</p><p>Max noticed she hadn\u2019t mentioned an emotional or physical connection. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have married him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI realized after that fiasco that I can\u2019t marry anyone. My life\u2019s too unpredictable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it wouldn\u2019t be safe for the man you married?\u201d</p><p>Had he read her thoughts? \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. It wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting that bastard, Patterson, continue to run your life.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t disagree. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask me if I slept with John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cI already know you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cHow could you know?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say what he was thinking, that any man who had gone to bed with Ellie would never want or need any other woman. Instead, he said, \u201cI just know.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>Bridezilla arrived at the house at seven o\u2019clock with her fianc\u00e9 and her sister.</p><p>Max watched from the window as John carried Annie\u2019s suitcase and walked between the two striking women. The twins were identical, all right. Both were of medium height and had long blond hair a shade darker than Ellie\u2019s, and delicate features. In Max\u2019s opinion, the sisters were very pretty, but in no way could they compete with Ellie\u2019s beauty.</p><p>John Noble was something else. He looked as though he should be working on Wall Street or maybe as a mannequin in a department store window. He was tall, thin, and neatly dressed in a starched, light blue shirt and pressed khakis. Not a hair was out of place. There was something odd about him, though. Max couldn\u2019t figure out what it was until John got closer to the house. He realized then that John\u2019s forehead didn\u2019t move when he smiled. It was as though his skin had been frozen. Botox? Surely not.</p><p>Ellie came up behind Max. \u201cThe bad seed\u2019s the one on the left,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He tried not to smile. \u201cTry to get along,\u201d he whispered back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou sound like my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it, sweetheart. Play nice.\u201d</p><p>Her father rushed past them and opened the front door.</p><p>Annie spotted Ellie. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would make it,\u201d she cried out. \u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here.\u201d</p> <p>The sisters were talking a mile a minute as they hugged each other. Though they were speaking at the same time, they still seemed to understand what the other was saying.</p><p>Ava stood behind Annie, waiting. She clutched a notebook in her arms, and Max noticed she acted irritated that she was having to wait for Ellie\u2019s attention. When it was her turn, she gave Ellie an air kiss on her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you decided to behave like an adult and come home for the wedding,\u201d Ava said. She lowered her voice. \u201cAnd, by the way, you are in the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Ellie replied.</p><p>She plastered a smile on her face and introduced Max to her sisters. She didn\u2019t say anything negative about Ava, though there were a few choice words she would have liked to use. Then she introduced John.</p> <p>He had been standing in the door with his head down. When she said his name, he looked up, but he didn\u2019t look at Ellie. His face was red, and his eyes darted back and forth as though they were afraid to meet hers. He nervously stepped forward and shook Max\u2019s hand, and the room fell silent. Finally, he glanced up at Ellie and said, \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations for what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Chapman Award.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hospital won the Chapman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you did.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou must be mistaken, John. I would know if I\u2019d won it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Dr. Westfield probably wants to tell you himself,\u201d he said. His embarrassment turned his complexion an even deeper shade of red. \u201cI guess I ruined his surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find out about this?\u201d she asked, still believing he\u2019d made a mistake.</p><p>\u201cI was talking to Westfield\u2019s assistant about some papers I still hadn\u2019t received for the hospital here, and she mentioned the news to me. Everyone at St. Vincent\u2019s is so excited. It\u2019s such a huge honor, and it means they\u2019ll get additional grant money and other funding. You should be hearing from Westfield anytime now. You\u2019re going back there, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019m not signing a contract, though. I promised Westfield I\u2019d help out for a little while when they need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did win it, Ellie,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>Now that the initial awkward moments were out of the way, Ava had lost interest in the conversation and had gone into the kitchen to talk to her mother.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Chapman?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>John answered. \u201cIt\u2019s a prestigious award given for outstanding achievement in the field of medicine. This year it was awarded to Ellie and, therefore, to her department, too. It\u2019s a coveted prize,\u201d John stressed, \u201cbecause it\u2019s so rarely given. The last Chapman Award was presented eleven years ago to a senior resident and his department in Memphis.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill there be a presentation?\u201d Annie asked. \u201cAnd will Ellie get a medal or something?\u201d</p><p>John smiled at Annie, glad to have somewhere else to direct his attention. \u201cShe\u2019ll get a little more than a medal. The award comes with a large cash prize. Half goes to the department and half to Ellie. She won\u2019t even have to pay taxes. That\u2019s included in the award.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would certainly help with your loans, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Annie said.</p><p>Ellie was still incredulous. \u201cIf I had won it, Dr. Westfield surely would have called me by now.\u201d</p><p>Her father kissed Ellie\u2019s forehead. \u201cEven if you didn\u2019t win it, you know your mother and I are very proud of you, don\u2019t you? We may not be able to brag about you to the relatives and our friends the way we\u2019d like, but you know how we feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Daddy, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy chicken\u2019s going to be all dried up if we don\u2019t eat soon,\u201d her mother called. \u201cJohn, would you mind taking Annie\u2019s suitcase upstairs to the lavender room? Annie, fill the water glasses please.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s cell phone rang. Ben was calling. He excused himself and headed to the office again for privacy. He was crossing the hallway when he heard Ava ask Ellie whether she had brought a long black dress to wear in the wedding, or whether she needed to buy one. Without breaking stride, Max turned around, grabbed Ellie\u2019s hand, and pulled her with him into the office.</p><p>Since he was on the phone, Ellie waited to explode, but it took work. She wanted to grab Ava by the shoulders and shake some of the smug attitude out of her. Annie passed by the door saying she was going upstairs to get something out of her suitcase, and a minute later Ellie heard her laughing. She knew why. Annie had seen the color on the walls of her room. For some reason her sister\u2019s laughter took the edge off Ellie\u2019s anger. She had promised her mother she would try to get along with Ava, and by all that was holy, that was exactly what she was going to do. She would not allow her sister to provoke her.</p><p>While sitting on the window seat waiting for Max to finish his call, she got a text from Addison MacBride asking about prenatal vitamins and water retention. It took four texts for Ellie to answer all her questions, and then Addison asked if Ellie would consider coming to Honolulu for a visit. She responded that she would love to visit, but she couldn\u2019t commit to a date because her schedule was so screwy at the moment.</p><p>That was an understatement. She didn\u2019t know what she would be doing the next two months or even the next two weeks. Her future was dependent upon the FBI apprehending the man who was hired to kill her. That is, if there was only one. Had the Landrys hired more than one hit man? And how exactly did one know where to go to hire a killer? You certainly couldn\u2019t place ads in the newspapers. Those were becoming antiquated anyway. The Internet, she decided. You could get anything on the Internet if you knew where to look. Maybe the Landrys Googled it, she considered. Perhaps they typed \u201cNeed hit man\u201d and then clicked the search button.</p><p>Okay, her mind was wandering and her thoughts had become loopy. Max had walked to the other side of the office and was listening intently to what Ben was telling him. Ellie didn\u2019t particularly want to leave him to join the others, but she was about to get up and go into the kitchen to help when her cell phone rang.</p><p>Dr. Westfield was calling, announcing to her that she had, indeed, won the Chapman Award. She was shocked and humbled. She thanked him profusely, then she listened as he raved about what the award would mean to his department. She had never heard Westfield jubilant before and doubted that she ever would again.</p><p>Ellie decided to wait to tell the family. Tonight was all about Ava and the wedding, but she did want to tell Max right away.</p><p>After he finished his call, he turned to her. She saw the grim look on his face and forgot all about her happy news.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone got to Greg Roper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, got to him? Did he get hurt?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe don\u2019t know, he\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s mother appeared in the doorway. \u201cDinner\u2019s on the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this later,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dinner was a trial of endurance for Ellie. Her parents tried to keep the conversation light, but there was an undercurrent of tension waiting to erupt. After two glasses of wine, Ava was no longer even pretending to be interested in anything anyone else had to say. She wanted to talk about the wedding and all the work she had done to make it perfect. No one was going to ruin it, she declared more than once, and Ellie couldn\u2019t help but notice she stared at her each time she said it.</p><p>Ava made another snide remark, this time about Ellie\u2019s outfit, and that did it.</p><p>\u201cJohn, you\u2019re right,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cI just heard from Dr. Westfield. I did win the Chapman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you so,\u201d John said, beaming. \u201cI really wasn\u2019t surprised when I heard. I always knew you were the best surgeon in the hospital. The residents were amazed at your skill. You should have heard them talking about you in the lounge. Westfield called you brilliant. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd getting him to say anything positive about any of his surgeons would take a miracle. You were always special, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>Ava didn\u2019t utter a word, but the evil eye she gave John said it all. She was seething inside.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Annie said. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, that\u2019s wonderful news,\u201d her father said.</p><p>\u201cYes, wonderful,\u201d her mother agreed.</p><p>\u201cDoes everything always have to be about you?\u201d Ava demanded.</p><p>Ellie burst into laughter. \u201cOh, Ava, you just never change, do you?\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s chin came up. \u201cI\u2019m taking that as a compliment,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd by the way, you are going to be in my wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><p>Max was fascinated by the conversation among the sisters. He\u2019d lived with brothers most of his life, and he now realized how unbelievably different sisters were. In his family, any major argument was settled with a couple of good punches, unless their parents were around, and then the problem was resolved and they moved on. There were no hard feelings. His brothers didn\u2019t hold grudges, but Ellie\u2019s sister Ava certainly did.</p><p>\u201cMy being in your wedding isn\u2019t going to stop any rumors, Ava,\u201d Ellie protested.</p><p>Annie nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s right, Ava. This wedding is making you a little paranoid.\u201d</p><p>Their father offered everyone at the table a glass of wine, but Ellie declined. After Ava\u2019s third or fourth argument on the subject of the wedding, Ellie excused herself from the table, went to the kitchen, and carried back a gallon of milk and a glass. She plopped both down in front of her plate.</p><p>\u201cPut the milk in a pitcher,\u201d Ava instructed. \u201cWe aren\u2019t hillbillies.\u201d</p><p>Ellie ignored her, poured herself a glass, and took a sip.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to listen to this,\u201d their father said. \u201cCome on, Claire. You, too, Max and John. We\u2019ll let the girls hammer out their differences.\u201d</p><p>Her mother gave Ellie a slight shake of the head and a warning look before she left to sit on the porch with the others. Ellie wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if she had used two fingers to point to her eyes and then point to Ellie\u2019s to let her know she would be watching her.</p><p>As soon as the sisters were alone, Annie turned to Ellie. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about Max? He\u2019s hot,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIsn\u2019t he? A man with a gun and a badge. There\u2019s something sexy about it, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wears a gun and carries a badge because he works for the FBI, and he\u2019s also a friend, so I invited him to come along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet he didn\u2019t know what he was getting into,\u201d Annie said with a quick nod toward her twin.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s too tough looking for my liking,\u201d Ava said with a shrug. \u201cJohn\u2019s so much more polished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he just a friend?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, and, Ava, I\u2019m not going to be in your wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. It\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, let\u2019s not argue,\u201d Annie begged.</p><p>\u201cAnnie, are you feeling okay? You\u2019re so pale,\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Annie said. \u201cI\u2019ve been up since five this morning, and I didn\u2019t get to bed until late.\u201d</p><p>Ellie turned back to Ava. \u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s the only way?\u201d \u201cYes, the only way to what?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>Ava explained, \u201cBeing in the wedding is the only way to put those vicious rumors to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat vicious rumors?\u201d Ellie asked. She poured another half glass of milk and took a sip. Being close to Ava was going to give her an ulcer. Fortunately, she wouldn\u2019t have to put up with her for long.</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know. Explain the vicious rumors.\u201d</p><p>Ava straightened in her chair and glared at Ellie. \u201cFine. People are saying I broke up your engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how people in town would know that,\u201d Annie said. \u201cWho would have told them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one had to tell them,\u201d Ava said. \u201cMom had spread the word about John before Ellie ever brought him home. All of her friends knew she was bringing him to meet the family. They had to wonder why he was suddenly marrying me and not her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not so awful,\u201d Annie protested. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t necessarily ruin your reputation.\u201d</p><p>Ava scoffed. \u201cThat\u2019s not all. Someone, and I don\u2019t know who it was but I\u2019m guessing it was Mom\u2019s best friend, Mrs. Grimes-you know Mom had to confide in someone-anyway, someone spread the rumor that John and I were found in a... compromising position the day after Ellie brought him home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t that happen?\u201d Annie asked. \u201cI wasn\u2019t here, but Mom said-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d Ava demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on anyone\u2019s side. I\u2019m simply asking if it really happened. Did it, or didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t relevant,\u201d Ava snapped.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to ask John,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>\u201cYou keep him out of this. Yes, okay, I did have sex with John while he was engaged to Ellie, but I don\u2019t think anyone needs to know about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s the truth, not a rumor. You do know the difference,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d Ava said. \u201cJust finished law school, and you think you\u2019re a prosecutor. Quit interrogating me.\u201d Her voice reeked of sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m simply asking you how you can call the truth a rumor,\u201d Annie persisted.</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to.\u201d Ava raised her voice to a shout. \u201cI am determined to quell these vicious rumors because I have to live in this town, and I don\u2019t want people talking about me behind my back, saying terrible things about my character.\u201d</p><p>Annie looked at Ellie and rolled her eyes. \u201cAva, are you sorry for what you did to Ellie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. Why should I be sorry? It was meant to be. John loves me, and I love him.\u201d She pushed away from the table and stood. \u201cI\u2019m going to check the backyard again before John and I leave. I probably won\u2019t get back here until the garden party, but if I need anything, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Annie and Ellie watched Ava until she\u2019d disappeared into the kitchen. Annie was the first to start laughing, but Ellie quickly joined in. The two sisters began to clear the table.</p><p>\u201cShould we ask Ava to help do the dishes?\u201d Ellie asked innocently.</p><p>They shared another good laugh.</p><p>\u201cRemember when we were kids? Ava always had something more important to do whenever it was time for chores,\u201d Annie said.</p> <p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cAfter I left, you got stuck with all the work. I don\u2019t understand why Mother didn\u2019t make Ava do her share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was easier not to argue with her.\u201d</p><p>Ellie stacked the dinner plates and carried them into the kitchen. Annie followed with glasses.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t said congratulations to you for finishing law school,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer yet, not until I know I\u2019ve passed the bar. I told Mom and Dad we couldn\u2019t celebrate until then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know what you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked the antitrust courses I took. That area interests me. I\u2019m kind of at a crossroads, I guess. I thought I had my future all mapped out, but now everything\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>Before Ellie could ask her to explain, Annie went back into the dining room to finish clearing the table. Ellie stood at the sink rinsing the dishes and putting them in the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do what you do,\u201d Annie said as she handed Ellie a platter. \u201cCutting into bodies. Just thinking about all that blood makes me sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe coolest thing happened a couple of weeks ago.\u201d She told her sister about a case she found fascinating, but Annie appeared to be grossed out. \u201cHe swallowed coins? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t explain why. Eleven dollars and fifteen cents.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. She laughed at Annie\u2019s expression. \u201cIt weighed a lot, but he didn\u2019t rupture. Then there was this man who got into a knife fight. Those can be nasty,\u201d she explained as she continued to rinse salad plates. \u201cHis femoral artery was nicked and blood started spurting everywhere. I plugged the hole with my finger while...\u201d She stopped when Annie gagged. \u201cQueasy stomach?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it. Don\u2019t you ever get sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she said. \u201cI throw up on patients all the time.\u201d She thought what she\u2019d said was funny, but Annie didn\u2019t laugh.</p><p>\u201cBlood makes me gag,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere does Mom keep her plastic bags for leftovers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThird drawer down,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Annie put the platter of leftover chicken on the table and searched the drawer. She held up a bread bag and smiled. \u201cShe still saves these. She used to put our sandwiches in them to take to school for lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom saves everything. There\u2019s a drawer with nothing but rubber bands, paper clips, and twist ties.\u201d</p> <p>Annie put the chicken in the refrigerator and said, \u201cTell me about Max.\u201d</p><p>Ellie leaned back against the sink and wiped her hands on a dish towel. \u201cWhat do you want to know? That I\u2019m starting to panic because I can feel myself getting more and more attached to him? Leaving him is going to be painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t leave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lives in Honolulu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Oh\u2019 is right,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to figure out a way to distance myself. You\u2019re so practical, Annie. Any ideas on how I can do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me think about it,\u201d she answered. She glanced out the window. \u201cHere comes Ava,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe had twenty minutes without listening to wedding plans, and I\u2019m thankful for that,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>Ava didn\u2019t stop to talk to her sisters. She walked through the house and went to sit with the others on the front porch.</p><p>Annie and Ellie had just finished cleaning the kitchen when their mother joined them. She took one look at Annie and said, \u201cGo up to bed. You\u2019re exhausted. Say good night to your father,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Max?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in your father\u2019s office. I think all the wedding talk spooked him. Now, Ellie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cI want you to go over the guest list for the wedding with me. I\u2019m worried sick I\u2019ve left out a relative.\u201d She went to a cabinet drawer and pulled out a thick notebook.</p><p>Annie left the kitchen before Ellie could ask her to stay and help.</p><p>Sighing, Ellie pulled out a chair at the table and sat beside her mother. \u201cIsn\u2019t it too late to add another guest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got extra invitations. If I\u2019ve missed someone, I\u2019ll simply tell them that their invitation was returned. A little lie is better than hurting someone\u2019s feelings.\u201d</p><p>What her mother was asking of her didn\u2019t make any sense. Ellie had left home when she was twelve. She didn\u2019t even remember half her relatives. She decided to humor her mother, though, because she knew the stress of having everything perfect for Ava\u2019s wedding was wearing on her.</p><p>It turned out to be a pleasant task. Ellie would read a name while her mother crossed it off the list. If she couldn\u2019t remember the people, her mother would tell her a story about them. It made Ellie feel more connected to her family, and when she did remember an aunt or an uncle or a cousin, her mother was so pleased.</p><p>They sat together until almost ten o\u2019clock when Ava and John came in to say good-bye. Her mother and father were clearly worn-out and headed to bed. Ellie went into the living room and read a magazine while she waited for Max. Annie walked in a minute later.</p><p>\u201cI thought you went to bed,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>Max poked his head into the room and said, \u201cCome find me when you\u2019re ready to leave the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Ellie promised.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Annie asked. She plopped down next to Ellie on the sofa, kicked her shoes off, and tucked them under her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to do but sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva has me going ten different places with her. So tell me the long story now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfidential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfidential,\u201d Annie agreed.</p><p>\u201cThere was a shooting just outside my hospital,\u201d she began and told Annie everything that had happened since that day, and of course the real reason Max was with her. Annie asked a lot of questions, but she didn\u2019t seem worried.</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad know all about it, and they understand I\u2019ll have to leave after the garden party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it safe for you to stay that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to leave, but it\u2019s really important to Mom that I stay at least until the party\u2019s over. Max has other agents coming to help with security,\u201d she answered. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t plan to stroll down the street alone. I\u2019ll stay close to the house during the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want Ava to know about this.\u201d Annie was making a statement not asking a question.</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>Ellie kicked her shoes off and sat back. They talked a little more about the shooting, and then Annie changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Ava will sweeten up once she\u2019s married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Once you go to the dark side, it\u2019s tricky coming back.\u201d</p><p>Annie poked her arm. \u201cYou love her. You know you do. She\u2019s your sister. You have to.\u201d</p><p>Leave it to Annie to find the positive, Ellie thought. Whenever things were strained, she was the peacemaker. Ava and Ellie had caused their share of strife in the family over the years, but not Annie. She was the kind, gentle soul who brought everyone together. She had been the perfect daughter, the one who had never been a source of worry in the family.</p><p>Ellie finally relented. \u201cYes, I love her. I don\u2019t like her, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she heard about a hit man, she\u2019d flip out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019d blame me,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cNot many people have a stalker, and I\u2019ve now got two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you\u2019ve got a stalker and a hit man. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both trying to kill me,\u201d she said. \u201cBet you can\u2019t top that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet I can,\u201d she said, nudging Ellie again. \u201cGuess what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY \u2013 ONE</p><p>Max made sure all the windows and doors were locked in the main house and then took Ellie up to their apartment. The air was stifling.</p><p>\u201cI thought Dad had the repairman install a window unit,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>\u201cHe did. He didn\u2019t turn it on, though. It must be ninety in here.\u201d</p><p>Ellie thought it was hotter. She followed Max into his bedroom but stopped when she saw the oversize window unit. \u201cIt\u2019s huge. Does it fit, or will it fall on the floor during the night?\u201d</p><p>Max checked it out. \u201cIt barely fits,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cIf it falls, it will go out the window, not in.\u201d</p><p>He looked at all the switches and dials and finally located the on and off button. He pushed it on and waited. The unit shuddered and began to make a low humming sound. Cool air immediately poured out of the vents.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I think we\u2019re in business,\u201d Max said. \u201cIt\u2019s set for seventy degrees.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was feeling hot and sticky and took a quick shower. She put on an extra-large T-shirt for a nightgown, then went into the living room to see if SportsCenter was on while Max showered.</p><p>He walked into the living room wearing a pair of gray boxer shorts and nothing else. His hair was still wet, and he was drying it with a towel. Ellie felt that familiar stirring in her body just looking at him. He had a massive chest. It was all muscle. She knew that for a fact because she had kissed every inch of it. His dark, curly chest hair tapered to a V at his belly button. She\u2019d kissed that, too, she remembered, and oh God, what hadn\u2019t she kissed? His legs and thighs were just as muscular. She remembered squeezing those thighs in the throes of passion.</p><p>Was it getting hotter in here?</p><p>Max put the towel on the rack in the bathroom, then went to the kitchen to get a beer. He noticed Ellie\u2019s face was flushed.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to buy a pregnancy test.\u201d</p><p>The announcement didn\u2019t faze him. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cCan it wait until tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Max opened the beer bottle, tossed the lid in the trash can, and sat down beside her, scooting her over to the end of the sofa so he wouldn\u2019t be near the lumpy springs. He took a drink and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it a little too soon to know if you\u2019re pregnant? It\u2019s only been one day,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I used protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for me,\u201d she said, exasperated.</p><p>She took a drink of his beer and handed it back to him. Max reached for the remote, but Ellie was quicker.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for Annie, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an FBI agent. We\u2019re trained to be observant. Now give me the damned remote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, there\u2019s the process of elimination. Your mother is a little too old to get pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cAnd Ava can barely stand to look at you, so she certainly wouldn\u2019t confide in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that left Annie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, reaching for the remote again.</p><p>She stretched her arm out to the side and held the remote in her fist.</p><p>\u201cBut there were other signs,\u201d Max continued. \u201cAnd we agents are trained to pick up on those signs.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes heavenward. \u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie didn\u2019t drink any wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did we.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer complexion was gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe threw up.\u201d He halfheartedly tried to grab the arm with the remote.</p><p>\u201cWhere did she throw up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the trash can in your father\u2019s office. Fortunately, the can had a liner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was she doing in his office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needed a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what the favor was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She sighed in frustration. \u201cMaybe she threw up because she had eaten something that disagreed with her. Were you there when it happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI held her hair back for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was sweet.\u201d She kissed him on the cheek and handed him the remote.</p><p>He immediately began to channel surf. \u201cBut the number one reason I know why she thinks she\u2019s pregnant...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me.\u201d</p><p>Ellie thought about it for a minute and said, \u201cAnnie doesn\u2019t want anyone else to know. I wonder if she told Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t want to take anything away from her focus on the wedding. Ellie, do all women get crazy about their weddings like Ava?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean act like a maniac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not all brides behave like Ava.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWhere do you want to get the pregnancy test? I think I saw a drugstore when we were pulling into Winston Falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, no, no. The entire town would think I was pregnant if I purchased a test here. My parents would hear about it before we got back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be meeting Agents Clark and Hershey before they get here tomorrow. I\u2019ll set it up in another town nearby. We could find a pharmacy there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a plan,\u201d she said, smiling. She took another drink from his bottle and handed it back to him. \u201cYou really won\u2019t tell me what favor Annie wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the favor is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get that far. But when I find out what she wants, no, I won\u2019t tell you. It\u2019s an FBI agent and client confidentiality issue,\u201d he teased. \u201cIf she wants you to know-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent and client? That\u2019s a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me understand. She asked for a favor, but she wouldn\u2019t tell you what it was?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t tell me,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She sounded disgruntled.</p><p>\u201cHer face was in a trash can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to ask her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d have a trash can handy when you do.\u201d</p><p>Yawning, she stretched her arms above her head and stood. \u201cIt\u2019s still beastly hot in here. Think we could turn the fan up a notch or two?\u201d</p><p>Max turned the television off and followed Ellie. \u201cLet\u2019s go to bed.\u201d</p><p>She noticed the door to the smaller bedroom where she planned to sleep tonight was closed. She opened it and felt a rush of hot air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to keep your door wide open, or my room won\u2019t get any air.\u201d She walked into his room to feel the cooler temperature.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to sleep with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. Max couldn\u2019t have heard her anyway. A scant second after asking the question, he flipped the switch up to high on the air conditioner and was nearly lifted off his feet by the noise.</p><p>Ellie fell back onto the bed. The entire floor seemed to vibrate, and the bed was doing a shimmy to the middle of the room. It sounded as though a Lear jet was landing in the apartment.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop laughing. She wiped the tears from her cheeks and tried to catch her breath. She was getting a stitch in her side watching Max. He was cursing the air conditioner while turning every possible lever and button to get it to stop. He finally unplugged it.</p><p>The unit didn\u2019t die easily. It shuddered again. Its last gasp was so forceful, the glass in the window above rattled... then blessed silence.</p><p>Max stood over Ellie watching her. She was on her back with her arms above her head, and her laughter was so joyful and uninhibited. He dropped down on top of her, careful to keep his weight off her, and pinned her with his pelvis on top of hers, and his hands holding hers. He looked down at the tears in her eyes. God, she was something else.</p> <p>\u201cDaddy got another deal, didn\u2019t he?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He slowly nodded. Then he leaned down and kissed her. She pulled her hands free and wrapped them around his back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to get hot in here,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>He was nuzzling her neck, and she couldn\u2019t stop herself from stroking his back and his shoulders. \u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t let me do this, Max.\u201d</p><p>She pushed his shoulders back and rolled on top of him. Her shirt had ridden up, and she could feel him pressed against her. She stretched her body over his, slid her fingers into his hair, and kissed him on the mouth, a hot, wet kiss that made her want much, much more.</p><p>Max tightened his grip on her hips. Her breath was warm and sweet.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to do this, stop messing with me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She kissed the pulse at the base of his neck. \u201cI want to, but I worry about you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThis could become habitforming for you.\u201d</p><p>She was moving downward, kissing his chest as she moved erotically against his pelvis. Her hands were stroking him, driving him crazy. When she reached his stomach, she smiled at his indrawn breath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to become attached to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>She moved lower, and he couldn\u2019t think. Only when he knew he was about to lose control did he take over. He rolled off the bed, telling her he\u2019d be right back, and he returned in seconds. He wasn\u2019t gentle as he took her shoulders. He saw the passion in her eyes and knew she was ready for him. He entered her forcefully, and she cried out as the sensations began to build. She dug her fingernails into his shoulders.</p><p>Neither one could talk then, for the mating ritual was consuming them.</p><p>Max made it last longer this time so that she would cl**ax before he did. When she lifted her h*ps to take him deeper inside and cried his name, he buried his face in her shoulder and found his own release.</p><p>Later, as Max was coming out of the bathroom, he fully expected Ellie to be sound asleep, but she surprised him. She was resting on her side waiting for him. As soon as he got into bed, she curled up against him and said, \u201cI\u2019ll have sex with you if you answer a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cIs Simon going to be traded to the Colts?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWe just had sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand it\u2019s possible to do it more than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have done it more than once. At least a hundred times last night.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him. \u201cYou wish. It was four, not a hundred. Will you ask him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He rolled onto his back and pulled her close. She rested her cheek on his shoulder. \u201cTell me how you became a Daniels.\u201d</p><p>His sigh was long and drawn out.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to tell me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like talking about it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t prod, and five minutes later Max said, \u201cMy parents died in a car accident. A semi ran into them. I was five years old at the time. I didn\u2019t have any relatives, and the lawyer the court appointed me in foster care pocketed all the insurance money. I didn\u2019t have good luck with the three families I was placed with. The last was the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven,\u201d he answered. \u201cI ran away. It was the dead of winter, and I was hiding behind a Dumpster. I remember being so cold and feeling helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon happened. He was on his way home and saw me. He took off his coat and gave it to me and dragged me home with him. I was kicking and screaming, but I stopped when he vowed I would never have to go back to that foster home.\u201d There was a smile on his face as he continued. \u201cSimon was just a year older than I was, but he was big for his age and sounded as though he could pull it off. I believed him, anyway. So I went along. I lived in his house for over a week before his parents found out about me. The bruises from my foster parents were still evident. Simon\u2019s dad was an attorney, and he, too, promised I\u2019d never have to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was his mother like?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLoving,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they adopt you right away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were to ask them, they would tell you I adopted them. It became final when I was eight, and by then two more had joined the family. Bishop and Sebastian. And that court-appointed attorney who pocketed the estate money...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSent to prison,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Dad was able to get most of the money back. He put it in a trust fund for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did Bradley and Tyler and Adam join the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remembered their names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBradley and Tyler came five years after I did, and Adam was the last to become a Daniels a year later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo girls?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cMom and Dad said it would be cruel to inflict the seven of us boys on a sister. We were a rowdy bunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sound like wonderful people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best.\u201d He yawned. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something about the heat in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say we give the window unit another chance. You plug it in, and we\u2019ll keep it on low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>The plan worked. It seemed that, on low, the air conditioner cooperated. Ellie begged him to push the lever up a notch to medium to see what would happen. And once again the Lear jet all but blew them out of the room. Luckily, when he flipped it back to low, the humming sound returned.</p><p>Ellie had another good laugh, rolled onto her stomach, and was sound asleep seconds later.</p><p>TWENTY \u2013 TWO</p><p>Max was standing in the living room waiting for Ellie when Annie motioned to him from the hallway.</p><p>\u201cCould I speak to you in private?\u201d Annie asked. Since he was the only one in the room, he thought the question odd. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your office?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cMy office. I guess I\u2019ve been using it a lot, huh?\u201d</p><p>Annie nodded. \u201cEllie and I know what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re hiding from Ava and John. I like the man, but oh God, he\u2019s boring. I shouldn\u2019t have said that, I know, but he really is.\u201d</p><p>Max followed her to the office. She went in first and held the door. Once he was inside, she shut the door and leaned against it. Her complexion was green. Max reached under the desk for the trash can and held it out to her.</p><p>Annie noticed the leery look in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look okay.\u201d</p><p>She patted her cheeks, trying to get some color back. \u201cIt\u2019s the smell of coffee. It makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d</p><p>Max set the trash can down but kept it close just in case.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about throwing up last night. I hope that didn\u2019t gross you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got six brothers. Nothing grosses me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also sorry I didn\u2019t finish our conversation. After I ran upstairs to brush my teeth, I was having second thoughts.\u201d She looked uneasy and tentative.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some fresh air? We could go out on the porch to talk.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cAva\u2019s waiting in the drive.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, they heard a horn honk.</p><p>\u201cShe can be impatient,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the favor...\u201d She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you find someone for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to know I\u2019m looking for him. I just want to know where he is because... because...\u201d</p><p>The tears started, and Max was at a loss as to what to do or say. \u201cOh, don\u2019t do that,\u201d he implored. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t... Let me go get Ellie or your mom. Don\u2019t cry, Annie. I\u2019ll find him for you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how to comfort her. He went to her, thinking he could guide her to her sister, but as soon as he touched her shoulder, she leaned into his chest, and the tears turned into gut-wrenching sobs.</p><p>What the hell? Max put his arms around her and held her. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he promised. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>Ava was honking the horn nonstop, and Ellie went looking for Annie while her mother ran outside to tell Ava to stop making so much noise.</p><p>Ellie opened the office door and saw Max trying to console her sister. He was patting her back as she cried all over him. Ellie quietly pulled the door shut. Then tears came into her eyes. How could she not love this man?</p><p>Ava could damn well wait.</p><p>TWENTY \u2013 THREE</p><p>The article about the garden party was in the local newspaper Friday morning. Ava was upset. She had requested that they run the piece on Saturday because more people read the Winston Falls News on weekends, not during the week.</p><p>The first line in the article gave Ellie chills. It stated that Ava\u2019s sisters-as in plural-were hosting the affair. And that meant that anyone who read the paper would know she was back in town.</p><p>Had Ava deliberately included her as a way of getting rid of what she called \u201cvicious rumors\u201d? Ellie hoped not because that would make Ava a colossal bitch.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t ask her because she and Annie had already left on a day full of spa treatments and errands.</p><p>Ellie was finishing her second glass of milk, watching the repairman and her father cross the backyard to get to the air conditioner. Her mother was sorting through mail at the table.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen the article in the paper about the garden party?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. It was quite nice, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>It was apparent she hadn\u2019t noticed the word sisters, and Ellie decided not to make an issue of it. She would just be adding to her mother\u2019s worries.</p><p>\u201cThe backyard looks beautiful,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>Claire beamed. \u201cI thought the tent would make the yard look so much smaller, but I think it actually looks bigger now.\u201d</p><p>Max appeared in the doorway. \u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d her mother asked, looking anxious. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving Winston Falls, are you? You promised you\u2019d stay, and Aunt Vivien and Aunt Cecilia will be so disappointed if they don\u2019t see you. They\u2019re arriving this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, we\u2019re just doing some errands and meeting the agents Max has asked to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDressed like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the way I\u2019m dressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleanor, you\u2019re wearing tattered jeans and a T-shirt, and those shoes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d show Max the falls. That\u2019s why I\u2019m wearing my old tennis shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least take a change of clothes. You don\u2019t want to embarrass Max in front of his friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could never embarrass me,\u201d Max said. He tilted his head toward the door.</p><p>Ellie kissed her mother on the cheek and whispered, \u201cWe\u2019ll be home in time to help with dinner.\u201d</p><p>Ellie assumed Max hadn\u2019t seen the article in the paper. She waited until they were on their way out of town to tell him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t take the news well. \u201cSon of a...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe no one will notice.\u201d</p><p>The look he shot her made her feel foolish. \u201cOkay, but very few people read the local newspaper.\u201d</p><p>The muscle in his cheek twitched. That wasn\u2019t a good sign. Hoping to change the subject, she said, \u201cWould you like to see the falls today? It\u2019s a little hike, but not too bad.\u201d</p><p>He shot her the look again. \u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t on a vacation, sweetheart. I\u2019m supposed to keep you alive, got that? And trampling through the woods with a picnic basket isn\u2019t part of my job description.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said anything about a picnic basket,\u201d she snapped back. \u201cAnd stop calling me \u2018sweetheart.\u2019 That\u2019s supposed to be a term of endearment. You growl the word.\u201d</p><p>His cell phone rang. She poked him in the arm. \u201cIf that\u2019s Simon, you\u2019d better ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he said.</p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t Simon. It was Ben with more information about the missing eyewitness, Greg Roper.</p><p>Max finished the call and said, \u201cAgent Hughes doesn\u2019t think Roper\u2019s been killed. He thinks he\u2019s running. Someone got to him and scared him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens now? Can they even hold the Landrys without witnesses?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They discussed the possibilities for several minutes and ended up frustrated with no answers. \u201cBen said he\u2019ll call me later, after he\u2019s had a chance to talk to all the agents involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHughes will expect me to take the stand if the Landrys do go to trial someday.

It\u2019s a wait-and-see game now.\u201d</p><p>Max was taking his time getting to his destination. He was on the highway for a little while, then took an exit and drove down a side road for several miles before getting back on the highway again. He watched the traffic ahead of them and in the rearview mirror as he drove. She knew he was making certain no one was following them.</p> <p>He spotted a sign for a pharmacy at the next exit. \u201cWant to stop there and get the pregnancy test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo close to home,\u201d she said.</p><p>He got the same response the next three times he asked. Finally, he said, \u201cAre you going to buy this pregnancy test soon, or do you want me to drive to Miami?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stop at the next one,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if you found out you were pregnant?\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI\u2019d have a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Annie said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help her any way I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you tell the father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I would. I would have the responsibility to tell him. Did you ask Annie that question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe just took the bar exam.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, indicating that Annie had also mentioned that. How long had they talked? she wondered.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we meeting Agents Clark and Hershey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA restaurant called Hathaways. It\u2019s about a mile off the highway.\u201d</p><p>A sign for a national pharmacy chain appeared, and Max pulled into the parking lot. Ellie bought three pregnancy tests, each a different brand.</p><p>\u201cJust to be sure,\u201d she told Max at checkout.</p><p>The clerk behind the counter, a stout woman with rosy cheeks and short, curly hair, gave Ellie her change and, looking at Max and then back at Ellie, said, \u201cI\u2019ll be rooting for you.\u201d</p><p>Ellie smiled. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed.\u201d</p> <p>Once they were back in the car and on their way, Max said, \u201cYou\u2019re keeping your fingers crossed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to disappoint the woman.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re something else, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought dessert,\u201d she said and held up a Hershey bar and a Clark bar.</p><p>He laughed and shook his head again.</p><p>They reached the restaurant a few minutes later. They were early and had their pick of tables. Max chose one in the corner for more privacy. From where he sat, he could look out the window, and their backs were to the wall.</p><p>\u201cDo you know Agents Clark and Hershey?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve talked to them a couple of times, but I haven\u2019t worked with them. I\u2019ve been told they\u2019re good,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cHow are they going to blend in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t know they\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax, it\u2019s a small community. Every stranger sticks out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop worrying.\u201d</p><p>The waitress brought glasses of water and handed them menus.</p><p>His cell phone rang.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s Simon...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd stop obsessing about football.\u201d</p><p>She looked appalled. \u201cThat\u2019s un-American.\u201d</p><p>He answered the call on the fourth ring. \u201cAgent Daniels.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say another word for several minutes but the look on his face told her the news wasn\u2019t good. When he put the phone back in his pocket, he turned to her.</p><p>\u201cThat was Spike,\u201d he began. \u201cHe said he got a call from a friend who runs a guns and ammo shop near Winston Falls. He told Spike that, about five minutes after he opened the store, Evan Patterson walked in and tried to buy a gun.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY \u2013 FOUR</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t bad news,\u201d Ellie insisted. \u201cAnd don\u2019t give me that look. Now I know where Patterson is, and hopefully he\u2019ll come after me again, and you can arrest him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, he\u2019ll find a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould he know how to get one from the street? Where to go? Who to talk to?\u201d Agent Clark asked the questions. He and Agent Hershey had joined Ellie and Max just minutes after Max had talked to Spike.</p><p>Max had been right when he\u2019d said the two agents could blend in. John Hershey was under six feet and slight of build, though muscular. Ellie guessed him to be a runner, maybe even a marathon runner. With his thick, wiry hair and glasses, he reminded her of a professor at her father\u2019s university. Pete Clark had a stocky physique and a balding head, and his jovial round face made him look like everyone\u2019s favorite cousin.</p><p>\u201cThis Patterson guy\u2019s mental, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s stupid,\u201d Hershey said.</p><p>Clark had a photo of Patterson and another of Willis Cogburn downloaded to his phone. Ellie looked at Cogburn\u2019s photo and thought he looked like a normal person. Certainly not a hired killer. But then, she thought, what do those men look like? What would be so different about them?</p><p>Her attention was drawn back to the conversation about Patterson when Max said, \u201cHe won\u2019t shoot to kill. He would try to kill anyone who is with her, but he likes using his fists. He\u2019ll want to wound her so she can\u2019t run. If he gets a chance, he\u2019ll try to beat her to death.\u201d</p><p>Ellie didn\u2019t disagree with Max\u2019s conclusions. Clark had read part of Patterson\u2019s file and so had Hershey. Both of them felt the same as Ellie. This was an opportunity to get him once and for all.</p><p>\u201cIf he has a gun and goes after her, we could put him away for years,\u201d Clark said.</p><p>\u201cAll right, we\u2019re looking for two men now. We\u2019ve got their photos, and we all know what we need to do,\u201d Hershey said.</p><p>\u201cPut them down,\u201d Clark answered. \u201cLike rabid dogs. That\u2019s what I\u2019d like to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll arrest them instead,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>Max smiled at her. \u201cYou\u2019re the voice of reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding you\u2019ll be leaving directly after the party, right?\u201d Clark asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving until Patterson is behind bars,\u201d Ellie vowed.</p><p>\u201cEllie...,\u201d Max began.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t let him finish his thought. \u201cIf I have to knock on his parents\u2019 door and taunt him to get him to attack me, I will. I want you to catch him and put him away. Please. I want this nightmare to end.\u201d Her voice shook with emotion, and she took a deep breath to calm down.</p><p>Hershey nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s get this mother...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Cogburn,\u201d Clark added.</p><p>Hershey agreed. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get lucky and get him this weekend, too.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was quiet on the ride back to Winston Falls. Although it didn\u2019t show on her face, Max knew she was upset because she had ordered milk at the restaurant and downed it as though it were Pepto-Bismol.</p><p>\u201cDo you have an ulcer?\u201d</p><p>Ellie looked up with a quizzical expression. The question came out of the blue. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drink a lot of milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like milk. It soothes my stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ordered it right after you heard that Patterson tried to buy a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Neither one of them said another word for a while, and then Max broke the silence. \u201cCome on, Ellie. Tell me what\u2019s going on in your mind. I know you\u2019re worried.\u201d</p><p>Worried? That didn\u2019t even come close to describing the way she was feeling. \u201cI want to stay in Winston Falls and catch Evan Patterson. You have no idea what it\u2019s like not knowing where he\u2019s been hiding, but now he\u2019s here, and I have an opportunity to draw him out. Hopefully, he\u2019ll do something that will get him arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat has to scare you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing his face again will probably freak me out,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut right now I\u2019m not scared. You\u2019ll be there. You won\u2019t let him hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Her faith in him was humbling. \u201cDamn right.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her legs and shifted in her seat as she turned toward him. \u201cHis parents have been enabling him and making excuses for him and blaming me for years,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re on record saying I\u2019m the reason their son is tormented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart. I read your file. I think it\u2019s time I had a little chat with Mr. and Mrs. Patterson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you go there? If Evan is hiding in their house, they\u2019ll lie and say he isn\u2019t. They\u2019ll do everything in their power to protect him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Max agreed.</p><p>\u201cThen why would you go over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo put the parents on notice. They need to hear that their son is trying to buy a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it will make a difference.\u201d</p><p>The closer they got to Winston Falls, the more anxious she became. Her palms were sweaty and she was finding it difficult to breathe, signs of a post-traumatic disorder. Who could blame her? The name Patterson was synonymous with pain.</p><p>She wanted to drive him out of her thoughts, but each time she erased his name from her mind, the name Cogburn rushed in. Same game. Different player.</p><p>Seeing the distress in her eyes, Max reached over and took her hand.</p><p>His phone rang. It was Ben calling back. Max put the phone on speaker and set it on the console.</p><p>\u201cEllie\u2019s with me, Ben,\u201d Max said. \u201cTell us what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHughes thinks the Landrys are going to call off Cogburn,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg Roper,\u201d he answered. \u201cNo one knew about Greg Roper until he came forward. And now he\u2019s disappeared. The only logical explanation is that there\u2019s a leak. Someone\u2019s feeding the Landrys information about our investigation. We\u2019ve already appointed a task force to find out who it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that means the Landrys know that Ellie couldn\u2019t identify them from the mug shots,\u201d Max concluded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ben said. \u201cAccording to Hughes, the Landrys now have no reason to get rid of Ellie. He thinks she\u2019ll be fine on her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone found Cogburn yet?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m not leaving her alone,\u201d he stated emphatically.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Ben said. \u201cI think Hughes is jumping the gun here.\u201d</p><p>After he\u2019d ended the conversation, Ellie turned to Max. He was frowning.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m still in danger from the Landrys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019m not letting you out of my sight until I know where Willis Cogburn is.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY \u2013 FIVE</p><p>The forecast for Saturday was gloomy. Rain showers were expected to develop in the early evening. The morning of the garden party, however, was sunny, and there wasn\u2019t a cloud in sight to mar the blue skies.</p><p>Ellie\u2019s parents were sitting at the kitchen table with William\u2019s aunts, Vivien and Cecilia, when she walked in with Max.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it will rain tonight,\u201d William predicted.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cThis is Ava\u2019s big night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dear, the wedding is her big night. This is her second big night,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>Ellie was about to laugh until she realized her mother was serious. \u201cDoes Ava have a list of big, bigger, and biggest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start, Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>William introduced Max to his aunts. He shook their hands and smiled while they talked over each other greeting him and telling him their plans for the day. He caught the words museum and boutique, nodded because they looked expectantly at him, and laughed out loud when Aunt Cecilia patted Ellie\u2019s hand and asked her how she was doing in school.</p><p>\u201cYou remind me of my late husband,\u201d Cecilia told Max.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking he looks more like my late Edgar,\u201d Vivien said. \u201cHe was a handsome man.\u201d</p><p>Max wasn\u2019t sure how to respond, but Ellie saved him from having to say anything when she asked the aunts, \u201cDid you have a restful evening? I hope you were comfortable upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Vivien declared. \u201cIt was so nice of Annie to give up her room for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a lovely room,\u201d Cecilia interjected. \u201cThe new color is just beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Ellie shared a quick smile with Max, then said, \u201cWhere is Annie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left early this morning,\u201d her father said. \u201cPoor thing looked exhausted. She was white as a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just took the bar,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cShe should be exhausted. She probably studied night and day for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Of course, she\u2019s tired. She took that exam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did she go so early?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>\u201cAva picked her up at eight, and Annie took her dress for the party with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hem was torn,\u201d her mother explained. \u201cAva has a seamstress on call for her boutique. She\u2019ll mend it for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we get going, Claire?\u201d Vivien asked.</p><p>The three women stood and headed to the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back at four,\u201d her mother said. \u201cWe\u2019re deliberately going to be gone all day so that the cleaning people and the caterers Ava hired can get their work done. We\u2019d only be in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you come with us, Ellie?\u201d Vivien asked. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have lunch at that new restaurant downtown. We\u2019d love your company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got too much to do,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring you two a little treat,\u201d Cecilia promised.</p><p>Her aunt acted as though Ellie were still eleven years old, but she wasn\u2019t offended. \u201cThat would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a dress to wear tonight?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d She actually had brought two dresses, one that was periwinkle and a bit snug and another that was pink with a full skirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause we could take you to the boutique, and Ava could find something for you to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a dress, Mom,\u201d she repeated. \u201cWhen will Annie be home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva wants to make an entrance, and Annie will ride with her and John. They\u2019ll be here promptly at seven forty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe party starts at seven.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva wants to be late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFashionably late,\u201d Claire explained. \u201cThat\u2019s what she told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s her party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mentioned that to her, dear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t she be on time? And Annie\u2019s hosting the party. She certainly should be here to welcome guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva has two sisters. You can welcome guests until Annie gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha,\u201d Ellie said. Of course. Now she could see the plan. Those vicious rumors would go away if Ellie greeted the guests and welcomed them to the party. Ellie would be letting everyone know that she approved of Ava and John. Oh yes, Ava had it all figured out.</p><p>\u201cAha, what?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>Time to let it go, she decided. No more resentment. No more anger or embarrassment. Ava and John belonged together, and it was time for Ellie to be happy for them. She was never going to have a great relationship with her sister because they were so different, but she was okay with that. And she would try to get along.</p> <p>\u201cTonight has to be perfect for Ava,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>Ellie knew her mother\u2019s comment was a warning. \u201cWhy are you frowning at me? I\u2019m not going to do anything to ruin her perfect evening.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY \u2013 SIX</p><p>The Pattersons weren\u2019t pleasant people.</p><p>After Hershey and Clark arrived at the Sullivan house late in the afternoon, Max gave them instructions and made Ellie promise she would stay with them, then walked the few blocks to the Patterson home.</p><p>The couple opened the door together, but neither invited Max to come inside. Resentment etched Mr. Patterson\u2019s face, and anger radiated from Mrs. Patterson.</p><p>Max showed them his badge and said, \u201cMy name is Agent Daniels, and I\u2019m with the FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you people leave us alone?\u201d Mr. Patterson demanded.</p> <p>\u201cI want to talk to you about your son.\u201d</p><p>The couple edged their way out onto the porch, and Mr. Patterson pulled the door closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you want with him this time?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I want to know where he is,\u201d Max said calmly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Mrs. Patterson asked in a gravelly voice. \u201cSo you can harass him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr do you want to lock him away again?\u201d Mr. Patterson asked. He folded his arms across his chest and glared at Max. \u201cEvan hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, and I know the law. You can\u2019t touch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a good boy until she came along,\u201d Mrs. Patterson said. Only the slightest hint of disappointment flashed across her face before the anger took over again. \u201cWe had such high hopes for him. He was going to make something of himself. He was so smart and clever. All the teachers told us so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe ruined his life, getting the police involved and all. He didn\u2019t mean any harm.\u201d</p><p>Max wanted to argue, to remind them that Ellie was eleven years old the first time their son attacked her, but he knew it was useless to point out the facts. They had already twisted them to fit their agenda, and nothing he could say would change their minds. They wanted to believe their son was a victim.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to talk about the past,\u201d Max said.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know where Evan is. We haven\u2019t seen him in months,\u201d Mr. Patterson insisted.</p><p>\u201cIf we did know, we wouldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d his wife muttered.</p><p>\u201cYour son tried to purchase a gun yesterday,\u201d Max told them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Mrs. Patterson scoffed. \u201cYou FBI agents always lie.\u201d She pulled a pack of cigarettes out of her pocket and elbowed her husband for his lighter.</p><p>\u201cDid that woman call you and tell you the lie about a gun so you would come here and harass us?\u201d Mr. Patterson demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe know she\u2019s back in town. We read it in the paper. She\u2019s behind this.\u201d Mrs. Patterson lit a cigarette and inhaled. \u201cShe won\u2019t rest until she\u2019s destroyed our boy.\u201d Smoke billowed out of her mouth as she spoke. \u201cShe ought to be the one locked up is what I think. I hope she gets what she deserves.\u201d</p><p>Max was through being diplomatic. \u201cI\u2019m putting both of you on notice. If your son gets hold of a gun, and you do nothing to stop him, you\u2019re as responsible as he is if someone gets hurt. I\u2019ll lock you up, too.\u201d</p><p>They gave no response to his threat, but as he was walking down their porch steps, he heard their front door slam.</p><p>TWENTY \u2013 SEVEN</p><p>Clark and Hershey were in the apartment with Ellie. Max was unprepared for what he saw when he walked in. Hershey was shirtless and perched on the arm of the sofa while Ellie appeared to be rubbing his side. Clark was at the coffee table using Ellie\u2019s laptop.</p><p>\u201cWhat the...,\u201d Max began.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d Ellie said. She patted Hershey\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOkay, you can put your shirt on. It\u2019s scar tissue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Hershey asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. It\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>Ellie went to Max and almost kissed him before she realized what she was doing. She took a step back and asked, \u201cWhat were the Pattersons like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t ever win parents of the year,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Clark closed the laptop. \u201cI talked to your friend Sheriff Spike Bennett,\u201d he said. \u201cStrange name, but a nice guy,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe wanted you to know there\u2019s a gun shop close to a town called Lipton, and the owner isn\u2019t real reputable. Spike\u2019s been trying to shut him down, but so far no luck. He said that for the right amount of money Patterson could get anything he wanted. Bennett\u2019s on his way there now to talk to the owner, find out if Patterson came around yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019d tell him if he had?\u201d Hershey asked the question.</p><p>\u201cPatterson might not know about this gun store,\u201d Ellie suggested.</p><p>\u201cBennett wants to warn him, just the same. After he\u2019s finished in Lipton, Bennett will come here to help with surveillance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about anything tonight, Ellie,\u201d Hershey assured. He buttoned his shirt and tucked it in his pants.</p><p>Ellie checked the time. \u201cI need to get ready,\u201d she said. \u201cThanks for babysitting me.\u201d</p><p>Both agents, Max noticed, were smiling like idiots at her, but as long as they did their jobs, he didn\u2019t care if they were infatuated.</p><p>\u201cDoes it seem a little cold in here?\u201d Clark asked.</p><p>Ellie\u2019s laughter followed her into the bathroom.</p><p>Thirty minutes later she was ready for the party. Max had put on a suit and tie and was tugging on it when she walked out. She looked stunning. She wore a pale pink dress and high-heeled sandals.</p><p>\u201cDo I look all right?\u201d she asked. \u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>He shook himself out of his stupor. \u201cYes, you look fine.\u201d</p><p>Fine? Ellie knew he wasn\u2019t one to embellish... but fine? \u201cThanks,\u201d she said. She\u2019d spent a long time curling her hair just so, and she\u2019d even put on makeup. All that for fine?</p><p>\u201cYou look nice,\u201d she said. \u201cBut your tie is crooked.\u201d</p><p>She crossed the room and stood in front of him while she adjusted the knot in his striped tie. Her perfume enveloped him, and all Max wanted to do was tear her dress off and make love to her.</p><p>\u201cI hate ties,\u201d he said instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think you\u2019d be used to them,\u201d she replied. \u201cDon\u2019t you wear a suit and tie every day in Honolulu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we wear khaki shorts, no shirts.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhere do you put your badge and gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaistband of our shorts... or swim trunks. We have to be prepared for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do the female agents wear in Honolulu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBikinis,\u201d he answered with a straight face. \u201cWe don\u2019t get a whole lot of work done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not nervous about tonight, so you can stop trying to put me at ease.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her skeptically.</p><p>She kissed his cheek. \u201cOkay, I am a little nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could think of something to take your mind off tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s cell phone rang. She didn\u2019t recognize the number and almost didn\u2019t answer it.</p><p>\u201cYou need to find out who it is,\u201d Max insisted.</p><p>She answered the same way she had for years. \u201cDr. Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>The voice on the phone was deep. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to the Colts.\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s hands were still shaking from talking to Simon Daniels, the most spectacular quarterback of all time. Oh God, had she told him that? She couldn\u2019t remember what she\u2019d said for the first minute or two, but she knew she\u2019d gushed, then she had recovered and grilled him on the upcoming season.</p><p>It turned out that Simon was a bit of a hypochondriac, and for the next half hour it was quid pro quo. He answered a question she posed, and she then answered one of his. Some of his questions were hilarious, but she didn\u2019t laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo, that particular disease comes from a parasite found only in the waters of the Amazon, and, no, it isn\u2019t contagious.\u201d</p><p>She saw Max roll his eyes, and she shook her head at him.</p><p>Max finally took the phone from her when she held it out to him and said, \u201cSimon wants to talk to his white brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI carry a gun now,\u201d he reminded his brother. \u201cSo stop calling me that.\u201d</p><p>Ellie listened to the conversation and was shocked at the insults Max was hurling, but then she decided he was giving as good as he was getting. Brothers were so different from sisters. She doubted they whined the way Ava did.</p><p>Oh Lord, the party. She was supposed to be at the house fifteen minutes ago.</p><p>When she walked down the steps from the apartment, she was glad to see the weather was cooperating. Dark clouds hung overhead, and the air was stifling hot and muggy, but it wasn\u2019t raining. She thought it silly to plan a party outside this time of year, but she wouldn\u2019t share her opinion with Ava or her mother.</p><p>Clark and Hershey were checking the backyards on either side of the house and behind it. It was six o\u2019clock when Ellie and Max walked into the kitchen. The house was dressed up with flowers everywhere and candles ready to be lit. Even the worn furniture in the living room looked brand-new because of the roses on the coffee table. Her parents and her aunts were upstairs getting dressed.</p><p>Max was being sweet. He gave her shoulder a supportive squeeze and went to the refrigerator to get her a glass of milk. The guests would be arriving soon, and she was ready. She took a couple of steps across the living room and stopped to look out the window.</p><p>And there he was... Evan Patterson... pacing on the sidewalk in front of her house. She froze, and so did he, and for at least two or three seconds they stared at each other.</p><p>Then he smiled, and she ran.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here. He\u2019s here.\u201d She couldn\u2019t get her voice above a whisper, but Max understood what she was trying to tell him.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFront,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s in front.\u201d</p><p>Max grabbed her and pulled her to the hall closet. He pushed her inside and said, \u201cYou stay here until I tell you it\u2019s okay to come out.\u201d</p><p>She saw him draw his gun as the door was slamming shut. Ellie was shaking violently now and couldn\u2019t catch her breath, hyperventilating even as she was sinking to the floor.</p><p>Anger came like a shot of adrenaline. She wanted to go after Patterson, to hit him and kick him, to hurt him the way he\u2019d hurt her. She realized she was having crazy thoughts, but she didn\u2019t care. She would rather be furious than terrified.</p><p>She reached for the door handle and came to her senses. She strained to hear any noise, but the only sound was the running water from the showers upstairs.</p><p>Be careful, Max. He\u2019s mean and dangerous and cunning.</p><p>It seemed she waited an hour, but she knew her mind was playing tricks. It should be hot in the closet, she thought, but she was shivering.</p><p>Max finally opened the door. She threw herself into his arms. \u201cDid you get him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. He could feel her trembling and hugged her. \u201cClark and Hershey are still looking, but Patterson vanished. Are you sure...\u201d</p><p>She tried to push herself away from him. He wouldn\u2019t let her. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re sure it was him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He was wearing black pants and a white shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were his hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t see them. Behind his back, I guess, or in his pockets. He smiled at me, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get him,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cAnd then what? What can you do? It isn\u2019t illegal to walk in front of my house. I don\u2019t have a restraining order anymore, and that didn\u2019t help anyway. So far, Patterson hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s gotten hold of a gun, I can take him in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to find him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, what are you doing in the closet?\u201d Her father asked the question.</p><p>Max pulled her into the hall and draped his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, the thing is...\u201d She was trying to think of a gentle way of telling him about Patterson.</p><p>Max was blunt. \u201cPatterson was out front on the sidewalk.\u201d</p><p>The smile on her father\u2019s face vanished, and anxiety took its place.</p><p>\u201cDad, this is a good thing. We have three agents here, and if Patterson will try something, they can get him and lock him up.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention the possibility that Patterson might have a gun. \u201cThey\u2019ve got this covered. I saw him, but he left before I could tell Max. He\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should cancel the party,\u201d he said.</p><p>She tried to make light of the situation. \u201cAre you kidding? I\u2019m more afraid of Ava than Patterson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I tell your mother?\u201d he asked, and before she could answer, he shook his head and said, \u201cNo, we won\u2019t worry her.\u201d He turned to Max. \u201cIf that maniac comes back, you\u2019ll get him. In the meantime, you watch out for my daughter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before long there were caterers and servers going in and out of the house. Max talked to the man in charge, found out how many employees were working for him, and made certain he saw each face and spoke to each one.</p><p>Approximately eighty guests were on their way to the house now. The backyard could easily handle the crowd, but there were places Patterson could hide if he got that far. Each entrance would be closely monitored. Spike had offered to watch the street in front of the house. He would arrive soon. Until then, Ellie\u2019s father stood by the front door. Clark and Hershey would monitor the backyard and both sides of the house, and Max would stay with Ellie.</p><p>The caterers\u2019 two vans were parked in the driveway, so the guests reached the backyard by following a brick pathway on the other side of the house. They passed under a trellised arch and entered the garden between two tall planters filled with fresh-cut flowers.</p><p>Some of the older guests didn\u2019t want to take the roundabout way to the back but instead cut through the house. William ended up being a doorman. He greeted them at the door and escorted them through the house and out to the party, sometimes stopping in the kitchen for a conversation before the doorbell rang again and he was interrupted. As worried as he was about Patterson crashing the party, he was able to relax a little knowing that Ellie was safe with Max. He had no doubt that Max would give his life to protect her, though he prayed to God Patterson would be captured and led away peacefully.</p> <p>While her father greeted guests inside, Ellie stood outside on the lawn welcoming the new arrivals. She felt as though she had said, \u201cSo happy to see you\u201d and \u201cSo pleased you could come\u201d at least a hundred times. And her hand had been grabbed and patted more than that. She heard, \u201cYou poor thing\u201d and \u201cWhat a heartbreak this must be for you\u201d from some of her mother\u2019s friends, and \u201cWhat a trouper you are\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re so brave\u201d from others. Apparently, everyone in town had heard that Ava had stolen Ellie\u2019s fianc\u00e9.</p><p>Max stood behind her. When one woman patted Ellie\u2019s hand and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you give up on love,\u201d Ellie heard him cough, no doubt to cover his laughter.</p><p>Ellie\u2019s mother was having a wonderful time, mingling among friends. Ellie couldn\u2019t remember when she had seen her looking so radiant and happy. Her father walked out the back door with Mrs. Webster, their elderly neighbor, on his arm. He helped her down the steps and smiled across the lawn at his wife before turning around and going back inside. This was as it should be, Ellie thought. Their daughter was getting married. It was a happy time.</p><p>Minutes later, Max whispered in her ear, \u201cSpike Bennett just arrived. He\u2019ll keep an eye on the front now. I\u2019ll tell your father he can come outside.\u201d</p><p>At seven thirty the violin began to play. Aunt Cecilia and Aunt Vivien were holding court inside the tent and having a fine time. It was much cooler there because the tent company had thought to bring two small air conditioners. Each had been strategically placed near the back of the tent.</p> <p>Once the stream of new guests began to dwindle, Ellie walked around the lawn chatting with old acquaintances and checking on the caterers. Max was never far away. If the opportunity arose, she introduced him as a friend of the family. Clark and Hershey were barely noticeable. Every so often she would catch sight of them strolling around the perimeter of the lawn, watching for any signs of danger. They were so inconspicuous, no one would have guessed their reason for being there.</p><p>Aunt Cecilia motioned to Ellie and asked her if she would please fetch her wrap. She was feeling the chill from the air conditioner but was too comfortable to move.</p><p>\u201cShe just wants to show off her new shawl,\u201d Vivien said.</p><p>Cecilia nodded. \u201cIt is pretty, and I rarely get a chance to wear it. It\u2019s on the chair in our bedroom. Be a dear and get it for me. I hate to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Vivien asked. \u201cShouldn\u2019t Ava and John be here? And where\u2019s Annie?\u201d</p><p>Ellie checked the time. \u201cKnowing Ava, she\u2019ll be here in five minutes on the dot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHurry then. You don\u2019t want to miss her entrance.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was happy for a break. Max followed her into the house. While Ellie ran upstairs, he went to check the front door. He was pleased to find that her father had locked it. He stood at the bottom of the stairs waiting for her when he heard the scream.</p><p>Ellie didn\u2019t get as far as the bedroom. The linen closet door was wide-open. When she reached to pull it closed, Evan Patterson sprang at her from behind it. She saw the gun in his left hand and the loathing in his eyes. She screamed and shoved the door as hard as she could. It caught him in the side, and that gave her a second to get away.</p><p>He was strong, terribly strong. As she turned to run, he grabbed her arm and yanked her toward him. His hand felt like a vise, squeezing hard enough to make her think he could snap her bone. It was impossible to get free. She saw his fist coming toward her. She kicked him in the shin with the sharp heel of her sandal, then kicked him again in the thigh. It didn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>He aimed for her jaw and would have shattered it, but she lowered her head just as his fist struck. The side of her forehead took the blow, stunning her. The ring he was wearing cut into her. She flinched from the searing pain.</p><p>She was kicking and screaming when Max pulled him off of her. Her dress tore because Patterson wouldn\u2019t let go. As strong as Patterson was, Max easily lifted him and threw him into the wall, but fury gave Patterson new strength.</p><p>Max was trying to get the gun away from him and at the same time shield Ellie. Patterson rolled, then went flying down the stairs. Max pulled his gun and aimed, just as Patterson turned and fired one shot at them before ducking around the corner and disappearing. Max flew down the stairs after him, and Patterson shot again. The bullet went wild, hitting the ceiling as he was running out the back door.</p><p>With a diving leap, Max tackled him to the ground, but Patterson managed to get two more shots off. The bullets shattered one of the flowerpots, sending ceramic shards, like missiles, into the air. With his knee slammed into Patterson\u2019s spine, Max forced the gun away. Clark grabbed it and helped restrain him while Hershey ran forward, pulling handcuffs from his back pocket.</p> <p>Screaming, the party guests ran for their lives.</p><p>In front of the house, Ava had just stepped out of her car, too impatient to wait for John to come around and open the door for her. She adjusted her skirt, fluffed her hair, and took a step toward the sidewalk.</p><p>The stampede all but knocked her off her feet.</p><p>TWENTY \u2013 EIGHT</p><p>The aftermath wasn\u2019t pretty.</p><p>Ava stood in the center of the backyard surveying the damage. She didn\u2019t hear the thunder and was still standing there when the skies opened up and rain poured down on her. When she walked into the kitchen, she was soaked through.</p><p>John got a towel and tried to pat her arms dry, but she pushed his hand away. She was shaking with outrage.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d she demanded in a shout that vibrated through the house and could have registered at least a seven on the Richter scale.</p><p>Her mother sat at the table with her head in her hands as Ava ranted her accusations that Ellie had deliberately set out to ruin her party. After listening to the ridiculous outburst for several minutes, Claire raised up and said, \u201cAva, stop talking and go home. You\u2019re giving me a headache.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s hand flew to her throat. \u201cMother, this was supposed to be my night. And John\u2019s,\u201d she added. \u201cHow could you take Ellie\u2019s side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t taken any side,\u201d her mother said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what happened before you got out of your car,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t blame anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know who to blame. Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop shouting. I know you\u2019re upset-\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpset does not begin to describe what I\u2019m feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wedding has turned you into a crazy woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted it to be perfect. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d She burst into tears and moved into John\u2019s arms to let him comfort her. \u201cAnd the yard was so pretty after the flowers were delivered... and the tent was perfect and...\u201d She suddenly pushed away from her fianc\u00e9. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cIn the bathroom,\u201d her mother relented. \u201cMax and your father are tending to the cut on her forehead.\u201d</p><p>Ava stormed out of the kitchen, rushed past her aunts, who were sitting on the sofa enjoying slices of cake, and ran down the hallway, leaving puddles in her wake. She tried to get past her father, who was inadvertently blocking the bathroom door.</p><p>Ellie had already cleaned the cut with disinfectant from her father\u2019s first-aid kit and was now sitting on the side of the tub holding her hair back while Max applied Steri-Strips. He wasn\u2019t doing a good job because his hands were shaking. He was still so damned angry that Patterson had touched her, he could barely speak. Thoughts of what could have happened were racing through his mind. What if he had stayed outside? Patterson could have killed her before Max heard her scream.</p><p>\u201cMax...,\u201d Ellie began.</p><p>\u201cHold still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am holding still. I\u2019m a physician. Let me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I need to do this.\u201d</p><p>Ellie had been holding her hair back so long, her arm was going to sleep. She didn\u2019t complain, though. The look of anguish on Max\u2019s face made her want to comfort him, but she knew he would have none of it. He felt he had failed her.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, could you give Max and me a moment alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still bleeding,\u201d Max told her.</p><p>Her father put the first-aid kit in Ellie\u2019s lap and pulled the door closed behind him. Ellie heard Ava shouting and quickly got up to lock the door. She ignored Ava\u2019s pounding on the door as she took the Steri-Strips from Max and applied them to the cut. It took her three seconds to close the wound. Then she turned to him.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He glared back at her, still angry. \u201cI messed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you thanking me for? Stop that. Now isn\u2019t the time-\u201d</p><p>Ellie kissed his cheek, then his jaw. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, \u201cfor saving my life and for catching him.\u201d She rubbed her lips over his. \u201cNow you say, \u2018You\u2019re welcome.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, you could have been killed. I should have-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He realized they were back where they\u2019d started. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna keep this up until I say, \u2018You\u2019re welcome.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, until you kiss me.\u201d</p><p>He gently wrapped his arms around her, whispered, \u201cYou\u2019ve got blood in your hair,\u201d and kissed her. Her mouth opened under his.</p><p>All the while, Ava was banging on the door, threatening everything short of murder.</p><p>When Max finally lifted his head, he said, \u201cWant to borrow my gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hide in there forever, Ellie,\u201d Ava shouted.</p><p>\u201cMight as well get this over with,\u201d she said.</p><p>Max got in front of her and opened the door. He backed Ava up by simply walking into her. She didn\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>The aunts were horrified by Ellie\u2019s condition. Her torn dress was splattered with blood, and the hair around her wound was matted and bloody.</p><p>\u201cCome sit with us,\u201d Aunt Cecilia said, patting the cushion between Vivien and her.</p><p>Ellie obeyed and smiled as each aunt tried to comfort her.</p><p>Their sympathy enraged Ava. \u201cI\u2019m the victim here,\u201d she cried out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any blood on you,\u201d her mother snapped. She sat down in the wingback chair next to the sofa.</p><p>\u201cClaire, the cake is delicious,\u201d Cecilia said.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Annie?\u201d Ava demanded. \u201cShe\u2019ll take my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s changing her clothes, and for heaven\u2019s sake, there isn\u2019t any side to take.\u201d</p><p>Hershey motioned to Max. A minute later, Ellie looked over her shoulder to see the two men standing in the kitchen. Max had his hands in his pockets and was nodding every now and then at what Hershey was telling him.</p><p>As soon as Max walked back into the living room, William blurted, \u201cThis is all my fault. I left the front door unlocked when I was showing guests through the house. That\u2019s how he got inside. Before Spike arrived, he hid upstairs and waited. That\u2019s what he did, and it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho hid upstairs?\u201d Ava was trying to follow the conversation.</p><p>\u201cEvan Patterson. He got into the house with a gun, and he waited upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Ava was stunned. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone tell me? I heard someone say Ellie was in trouble, but I didn\u2019t know-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been ranting and raving in the backyard for the last half hour,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cNo one could get a word in edgewise.\u201d</p><p>Claire turned to her husband. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself, William.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Dad,\u201d Ellie agreed. \u201cYou need to focus on the good news. Evan Patterson is on his way to lockup, and Max told me that, because he had a gun and tried to kill me and a federal agent, he\u2019s not going to get out for a long, long time, if ever.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s spirits lifted. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true. I\u2019ll admit not knowing where he was hiding was a constant worry.\u201d</p><p>Ava slumped down in a chair. John kissed her forehead and announced that he was going to eat some dinner. The kitchen looked like a smorgasbord.</p><p>\u201cEvery time...,\u201d Ava grumbled. \u201cIt always becomes about you, Ellie. Every time. I\u2019m getting married, but tonight wasn\u2019t for me. I swear I think you planned it.\u201d</p><p>Always the drama queen, Ellie thought. She felt a burst of irritation and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Ava. I planned the entire thing. I called Evan Patterson, and I said, \u2018Listen, Evan honey, go get a gun, sneak into my parents\u2019 house, and hide upstairs. I\u2019ll let you punch me again and try to kill me so that Ava\u2019s party will be ruined.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cSarcasm isn\u2019t appreciated, young lady,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>Ava looked defeated. Her head fell forward, and her shoulders drooped. \u201cEvery time...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cOkay, Ava. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry I ruined your party. I really am. Everything was beautiful. You planned it perfectly.\u201d</p><p>Her sister perked up a little. \u201cI did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ellie said. Her head was starting to throb, her nerves were shot, and she was beginning to tremble in the aftershock of what she had been through. \u201cEverything was gorgeous.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you for admitting you ruined it,\u201d Ava sniffed.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did, and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said for the third time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll forgive you if you\u2019ll just promise me one thing,\u201d Ava said.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll stay away from my wedding.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY \u2013 NINE</p><p>Placated by Ellie\u2019s apology, Ava and John went home.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get some rest, Ellie,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she promised. \u201cBut I want to go upstairs and say good night to Annie first.\u201d</p> <p>She was surprised she got dizzy when she stood, but she was certain no one noticed. She didn\u2019t take the stairs two at a time as she usually did and even held on to the banister to keep her balance.</p><p>Annie was sitting in the middle of the bed with the unopened pregnancy kit.</p><p>\u201cShut the door,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Ellie quickly did as she asked, then sat down across from her sister. \u201cYou haven\u2019t taken the test yet?\u201d</p><p>Annie shook her head. \u201cOnce I do...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t undo it. I\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to know.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBut what if I am? I don\u2019t have a job, and I have student loans to repay. It\u2019s a little overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you are pregnant, do you want the baby?\u201d</p><p>No hesitation at all. \u201cOf course I want the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t alone, Annie. You know I\u2019ll help you. You can move in with me. And there\u2019s the father,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m such a screwup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t know where he is. I went a little bonkers, I guess. If I tell you something, will you promise not to be shocked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never... you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cPatterson scared me, and I didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with any man. I wouldn\u2019t let myself...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. I\u2019m not shocked,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the baby\u2019s father was the first man you\u2019ve slept with?\u201d</p><p>Annie nodded. \u201cFour months. That\u2019s how long we were together. It was... raw animal magnetism at first, I guess. I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean. Trust me, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the sex, though,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe was perfect. He was kind and considerate. We had so much in common. He loved the same things I did, and we could sit for hours and hours talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d Ellie asked.</p><p>Tears streamed down Annie\u2019s cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019d spent a terrific weekend together at the beach. He left my apartment Monday morning, and I never heard from him again. No call... nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Navy Seal,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought maybe he got a call from his commander and had to leave on a mission or something, but if that was the case, why didn\u2019t he call, or leave a note, or at least text me? He made me feel like a whore,\u201d she whispered. Tears clouded her eyes as she added, \u201cI really did screw up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe used protection,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I guess it isn\u2019t always dependable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tried to get hold of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I tried calling him, but he didn\u2019t answer. I even left messages for him, but he hasn\u2019t responded. Nobody will tell me anything.\u201d She wiped a tear away. \u201cIf he cared about me at all, he would have left some word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to Max, and he\u2019s going to try to find him for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when he does?\u201d</p><p>Annie straightened her shoulders. \u201cIf I\u2019m pregnant, I\u2019ll tell him because he\u2019s the father, and he deserves to know, but I\u2019ll make it clear I want nothing from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re emotional now,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cTake the test tomorrow morning and find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could take it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but your hormone levels will be higher in the morning,\u201d she said. \u201cOr do one test now and another tomorrow morning. Either way.\u201d</p><p>Ellie tried to get more information about the man, but Annie didn\u2019t want to talk about him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll take the test first thing in the morning, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I absolutely will,\u201d she promised.</p><p>The sisters spent the next hour catching up. They talked about work, the people they knew, even Ava\u2019s wedding.</p><p>Ellie stood. \u201cI need a shower and a bed,\u201d she said with a yawn. \u201cI\u2019m beat. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving Winston Falls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Annie nodded. She watched Ellie open the door and then said, \u201cIt\u2019s funny really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d she said, turning back.</p><p>\u201cI was always the good girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still are.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY</p><p>Max was waiting for Ellie downstairs. They said good night to her parents and her aunts and went up to the apartment. Max had left the window unit on low, and the bedrooms and hall were quite pleasant. The kitchen and the living room, however, were sweltering.</p><p>Ellie tripped out of her clothes, tossed the bloody and torn dress into the trash can, and got into the shower. She stood under the cool water with her eyes closed and tried to get her muscles to relax. She washed her hair, being careful to scrub around the cut, but she didn\u2019t bother to blow it dry. She brushed it over her shoulders, put on her cotton nightgown, her moisturizer and body lotion, and was ready for bed.</p><p>The storm outside had picked up. Lightning lit up the bedroom, followed by loud claps of thunder. Rain pelted the windows.</p><p>Ellie didn\u2019t ask Max if she could sleep with him. She pulled the sheet back and slid into bed beside him. He was on his stomach, one arm over the side of the bed, sound asleep. His gun, holster, and badge were on his bedside table. She rolled over to glance at the alarm clock and was shocked to see that it was after midnight. She closed her eyes. It had never taken her more than a minute or two to fall asleep, but tonight was different. Ten minutes passed, then ten more, and she was still wide-awake. This certainly was different for her.</p><p>Ellie replayed the day\u2019s events, but when she got to Patterson, she felt her heart pounding in her chest. She took several deep, calming breaths. The threat was over; he was locked up and couldn\u2019t bother anyone. This, too, was different. She could go anywhere and do anything now, couldn\u2019t she?</p><p>Not quite. There were the Landrys and the possibility that a man named Cogburn might come after her.</p><p>And then there was Max. He was going back to Honolulu, and she would probably never see him again. It was for the best, she decided. He\u2019d be safer there where people like Patterson weren\u2019t shooting at him. Ellie knew she wasn\u2019t being rational, but she was so rattled inside, she couldn\u2019t think straight. Was she reacting to Patterson\u2019s attack or was it the realization that Max was leaving?</p><p>No-brainer, she decided. It was Max. Ellie wanted to cry. She\u2019d told him not to get attached to her, and look what she\u2019d done. She\u2019d fallen in love with him. So not acceptable.</p><p>She had to distance herself, or she\u2019d become a blubbering idiot when he left. If she continued to lie there thinking about him, she\u2019d start weeping now. She swung her legs over the side of the bed and tried to get up. Max stopped her.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d he asked as he pulled her down beside him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d His voice was warm and husky. He covered her with his body and began to nuzzle the side of her neck. He rubbed her arms, then moved to her sides. \u201cYour skin\u2019s cold.\u201d</p><p>As he moved against her, his chest grazed her breasts, and the pleasure was so intense, she moaned. Ellie threaded her fingers through his hair and pulled him toward her. His mouth took absolute possession, their tongues wild as they mated.</p><p>Max wanted to savor the feel of her, and when she wrapped her legs around his and moved seductively against his arousal, his mouth covered hers again, and he thrust inside her. Their lovemaking was wild, both of them losing control. Ellie screamed his name when the sensations began to spiral. Her orgasm lasted longer than his, and he held her tight in his arms until she recovered.</p><p>The scent of their passion clung to them, and they were both soaked with perspiration. Max could feel her heart pounding under his. He kissed her chin and lifted up to ask her if she was okay. Words weren\u2019t necessary. Ellie was asleep.</p><p>THIRTY \u2013 ONE</p><p>Annie wouldn\u2019t take the test until Ellie arrived.</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nine o\u2019clock,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cAnd I had to pack and change the sheets and help get everything in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you riding with Max?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t you have a rental car? Isn\u2019t that how you got here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Clark took it last night. He\u2019ll return it to the rental company. Now stop stalling.\u201d</p><p>Annie grabbed the pregnancy kits and went into the bathroom down the hall. Ellie waited in her bedroom. She could hear the aunts chatting downstairs. Even with all the commotion, they seemed to be having a good time.</p><p>Ellie kept checking the time. Five minutes passed, then five more. No pregnancy test took ten minutes. She knew Annie was getting up her nerve. Just when Ellie was about to go get her, the bedroom door opened, and Annie walked in. She quietly shut the door behind her.</p><p>As soon as Ellie saw the smile on her face, she said, \u201cOkay, you\u2019re not pregnant. I know it\u2019s selfish of me, but a tiny part of me was hoping you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am pregnant,\u201d she said, and she was smiling about it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a great mother,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be a wonderful aunt. Ellie, did you mean it when you said I could live with you? For a little while, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I meant it, and not just for a little while. I\u2019d love to help raise my niece or nephew.\u201d</p><p>Ellie told her what prenatal pills to take and what she could do to help with morning sickness.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell Mom and Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Annie said. \u201cBut not until after the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ava?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter her honeymoon. She\u2019ll be there for me, too,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>Ellie wasn\u2019t so sure, but she kept her opinion to herself. The bond between twins was different from the bond between mere sisters. Ava used to boast that she and Annie were telepathic, which Ellie thought was ridiculous, but they did have a strange connection as children and could sometimes communicate with each other without speaking. But if they were so alike, how could Annie grow up to be so sweet and Ava such a viper?</p><p>\u201cMax is waiting,\u201d Ellie said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Max? I really like him,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>Ellie understood what she wanted to know and decided not to mince words. \u201cI do, too, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not looking for anything long-term.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was walking out the door when Annie said, \u201cOne last question and I won\u2019t nag you about him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in love with him?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her parents walked Ellie and Max to their car. Ellie had lipstick on both cheeks from her aunts\u2019 kisses. They thought they would be seeing her at the wedding, and she didn\u2019t tell them she wouldn\u2019t be back that soon.</p><p>Max backed out of the drive, and Ellie watched her parents\u2019 faces as they waved good-bye.</p><p>\u201cThey look relieved,\u201d she said.</p><p>Max had to agree. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to worry about Patterson any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but they also don\u2019t have to worry about me ruining Ava\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that Patterson is out of the picture, how could you ruin it?\u201d he asked. He turned the corner and headed for Highway 169.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something would happen, and she\u2019d blame me,\u201d she said. \u201cMax, when we get to St. Louis, will you go back to Honolulu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I have to get back right away. Are you going to miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be too busy.\u201d</p><p>Ellie thought she\u2019d handled herself okay. Her voice hadn\u2019t quivered when she\u2019d asked him if he would be leaving, and she thought she\u2019d been very calm and collected after he\u2019d answered. She was getting a little too good at not telling the truth.</p><p>THIRTY \u2013 TWO</p><p>When Willis Cogburn had first arrived in Winston Falls he thought he\u2019d found the perfect spot for the ambush. It took several days to convince him otherwise.</p><p>He\u2019d come prepared with a high-powered rifle, a couple of his favorite guns, and his surveillance equipment in the trunk of his rental car. It hadn\u2019t taken much finesse to find out that Dr. Sullivan was going to Winston Falls for a wedding. As soon as he\u2019d gotten the information, he\u2019d rented a car under a fake name and started driving.</p><p>Once he reached the small town, he checked into the Rosewood Inn under another false name and slept ten hours. Then he got down to business. He located where Dr. Sullivan\u2019s parents lived and spent the better part of the day sitting in his car a block away watching the house. He didn\u2019t see any sign of her until a car pulled into her driveway, and she came running out. She obviously knew the man who got out of the car. She threw her arms around him. At first, Cogburn thought he was her boyfriend, but then he saw the gun at his side. And when the man walked up the porch steps and turned slightly, Cogburn saw the badge clipped to his belt. He didn\u2019t need his binoculars to know that badge. It belonged to an FBI agent.</p><p>A text gave Cogburn answers a few minutes later. It told him that an FBI agent was on his way to Winston Falls to guard Ellie Sullivan.</p><p>Cogburn knew he had to find a way to get her alone, and that wasn\u2019t going to be easy with an FBI agent shadowing her. He needed time to think about it and to come up with a plan. He started his car and drove around the town for a little while, then stopped in a fast-food place for a hamburger.</p><p>He needed to get the lay of the land first, he realized. He started his car and drove back to her neighborhood, looking for possible places to hide, spots where he could get a good shot. Nothing satisfied him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Baseball cap low on his forehead, he parked the car at the corner of the Sullivans\u2019 block and got his surveillance equipment out of the trunk. He wasn\u2019t worried he\u2019d be spotted using it because it was just a small earpiece. Anyone walking by would think he was using a Bluetooth. It was the first time he\u2019d used this new earpiece, and he was impressed. According to the literature, he should be able to hear whispers as far as two blocks away. The ad hadn\u2019t exaggerated. Willis adjusted the magnification, sat back, and sipped on a limeade while he listened. A woman carrying a grocery bag walked up the sidewalk toward him, so he dropped his head and pretended to be talking. She smiled as she continued on.</p><p>For the first hour, Willis was able to catch only snippets of the conversation inside the house. He was thinking about getting some dinner when he got lucky. An upstairs window in the Sullivan house was open, and the voices of the people inside began to come through loud and clear. He heard an older man\u2019s voice talking about the falls and how Ellie should take Max to them. Cogburn assumed Max was the FBI agent because he knew Sullivan\u2019s first name was Ellie.</p><p>All right, he was in business. He hadn\u2019t found a place to hide near the Sullivan house, but maybe he had discovered something even better. Now he just needed to find out where the falls were.</p><p>The people of Winston Falls were proud of their town. Each time he stopped for gas and food, he was asked if he\u2019d had time to visit the falls yet. \u201cEveryone does,\u201d he was told. \u201cWhy, you can\u2019t come to Winston Falls and not go to the crystal clear water.\u201d</p> <p>Willis promised all the friendly townspeople he met that, yes, he would go to the falls.</p><p>He made good on his promise. It turned out the natural wonder was everything he\u2019d been told and much more, for it was at the falls that he found the perfect spot for the ambush.</p><p>He expected Dr. Sullivan and the FBI agent to appear at any moment. She\u2019d want to show him the town\u2019s pride and joy, right?</p><p>Wrong. For two long days and nights Willis sat cross-legged in the brush with his high-powered rifle in his lap, waiting. He wasn\u2019t alone. Hundreds of gnats and mosquitoes kept him company. There were also hordes of teenagers taking turns ha**ng s*x behind the waterfall. Willis guessed the kids believed the water hid them from view, and he wondered why they hadn\u2019t realized that, if they could see out, anyone walking by could see in. One teenage boy brought two different girls to the falls, at different times, of course.</p><p>Willis felt as though he were watching porn, bad porn, with lots of grunting and groaning. He would have left and formulated another plan if the spot he\u2019d chosen hadn\u2019t been the perfect place to kill someone. The noise from the water crashing down into the pool below would mask the sound of the rifle. And he was well hidden. Three teenagers walked right past him and never saw him.</p> <p>He had a lot of time to think while he waited, mostly about his little brother, George. He missed the stupid kid. He\u2019d told the Landrys that George was too young and not to entice him into their dirty business. They\u2019d ignored him, and George was so eager to impress and so foolishly impatient, he\u2019d gone and gotten himself killed.</p><p>George and he had such grand plans. They\u2019d wanted to start some kind of business together. Nothing big, maybe just a pack-and-ship kind of place, but something legit. A stint in prison had been hard on Willis, and he didn\u2019t think he could go back inside again. George would never have made it inside. He was too soft, too childlike.</p><p>Going straight proved to be impossible now. Once the Landrys had their tentacles around him, he couldn\u2019t get away. They knew the day he was released and contacted him that evening. \u201cWelcome back,\u201d Cal Landry had gushed.</p><p>The money was too good to pass up. A hundred thousand to pop the doctor. Who could turn that down?</p><p>He thought it would be so easy, but the second day of being eaten alive by bugs changed his plans. He had to find another way to get her. But where? He knew he could get the doctor in St. Louis, but why wait? Why not get her here in her hometown where there was less law enforcement? He\u2019d come to the conclusion that he might have to kill the FBI agent assigned to her as well, and that thought gave him chills. He\u2019d get the needle in his arm for sure if he got caught.</p><p>Prison had changed him. It hadn\u2019t hardened him; it had made him fearful.</p> <p>Willis finally came up with a new plan. He went over it several times until he was satisfied it would work, then he got up, zipped the rifle in the duffel bag with his two guns, and headed for his car. It was time to get his audio surveillance equipment out again. He\u2019d driven around the area enough times to know that there was only one road anyone could take from Winston Falls to the airport. Now he just needed to find out when they\u2019d be on it.</p><p>His cell phone chirped indicating he had a text. \u201cNumber unknown,\u201d he read, and that meant the Landrys. It was a one-word text: \u201cCancel.\u201d</p><p>He sat in the car for several minutes while he considered his options. The Landrys had already put half the money in the secret account. They\u2019d want it back, and that just wasn\u2019t fair. After all the preparation he\u2019d done? Then there was George. Cal and Erika had gotten his brother killed. Hell, no. He wasn\u2019t going to give them any money back. As far as he was concerned, he hadn\u2019t seen the text. He\u2019d do the job and keep the money.</p><p>THIRTY \u2013 THREE</p><p>Ellie watched the scenery out of her side window as Max drove around the curves of the worn two-lane road.</p><p>\u201cDo we have plane tickets? Clark told me he was taking care of it, but-,\u201d Ellie began.</p><p>\u201cYes, we do. You\u2019ll be sleeping in your own bed tonight.\u201d</p><p>Max saw a glint of steel out of the corner of his eye when they rounded another curve.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re near the falls,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there were time-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown! Get your head down!\u201d</p><p>Max shouted the command as he swerved the SUV to get out of the line of fire. Cogburn leapt onto the road, lifted his rifle, and fired two shots. Max recognized the high-powered rifle as he swerved again. \u201cThe son of a bitch is trying to hit the gas tank. Must think he can blow us up.\u201d</p><p>Ellie was amazed at how calm he sounded. The side of her face rested on his thigh. She was trying not to knock the gearshift.</p><p>The third shot hit the left back tire, and at the speed they were going, it was nearly impossible to control the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cHold on, sweetheart. We\u2019re going off-road.\u201d</p><p>The SUV was spinning, and Ellie thought they were going to roll, but Max knew what he was doing. Within seconds the SUV had righted itself, and they were headed into the woods.</p><p>He slammed on the brakes, got Ellie\u2019s seat belt off and his own, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Max threw his door open and pulled her out behind him. They both ran flat out, ducking under branches and leaping over scrub. Max stopped suddenly, motioned for Ellie to get down, and then pushed her back so that the branches concealed her. He put his hand up to tell her to stay still. And then he waited, crouched in front of her, listening to every little sound.</p><p>Ellie tried not to make any noise and to control her breathing. If Cogburn followed their tracks, he would find them. She remained motionless and silent.</p><p>How long had they waited? She didn\u2019t have any idea, but her legs were going numb, and she was trying to ignore the knot in her calf. How could Max stay in this position without moving a muscle for so long?</p><p>A twig snapped. Where had the sound come from? She thought the left, but Max sprang up and fired to the right, three shots in rapid succession as he moved forward, running toward his target.</p><p>He got Cogburn with the third shot. The hit man tried to get back to his car, but he had only made it to Max\u2019s SUV when he collapsed and began to scream. He wasn\u2019t given any sympathy. Max grabbed the rifle and tossed it into the back of the car, then squatted down next to Cogburn. \u201cYou\u2019re in a hell of a fix here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI need a doctor,\u201d Willis cried. \u201cI\u2019m bleeding bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just tried to shoot a doctor.\u201d</p><p>Ellie ran to the car and got gloves out of her purse, nudged Max out of her way, and knelt down beside the man who had wanted to kill her. Willis\u2019s eyes were wide with terror as Ellie pushed his hands away to check the damage.</p><p>\u201cThe bullet went through,\u201d she said.</p><p>She got up and went back to the SUV to find something she could wrap around the wound until Willis could get to a hospital. She ended up using an old T-shirt and the only dress she had left. She wadded the shirt into a ball to apply pressure, then tore the dress into strips to hold it in place.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any more I can do for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying?\u201d Cogburn began to wail.</p><p>Ellie knelt behind him now and was about to answer him when Max said, \u201cYou\u2019d better hope you\u2019re dying because, if you\u2019re not, you\u2019re going away for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t go back to prison. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a deathbed confession?\u201d Max asked. He was still so angry, he wanted to kill the bastard with his bare hands. He doubted Ellie would let him get away with that.</p><p>\u201cThis is all the Landrys\u2019 fault. It\u2019s because of them my brother\u2019s dead, and now I\u2019m gonna be dead, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Landrys didn\u2019t fire that rifle. You did.\u201d</p><p>Ellie pulled off her gloves and reached for her cell phone. She was going to call 911, but Max gave her another number.</p><p>\u201cHershey should still be in Winston Falls. Tell him to send an ambulance.\u201d</p><p>The agent answered on the first ring. He told her he was at the hospital with the sheriff\u2019s deputy and Evan Patterson, and that he would send the ambulance right away.</p><p>\u201cDid you know he was at the hospital?\u201d Ellie asked. She bent over Willis and checked his pulse. She didn\u2019t try to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cPatterson was complaining of chest pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re required to provide treatment.\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s shoulders sagged. \u201cSo I\u2019ll have to see him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going near him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he been there all night?\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cHandcuffed to a bed in ICU.\u201d</p><p>Willis started crying again. \u201cI can\u2019t go back to prison. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you testify in court, tell the judge the Landrys hired you to kill Dr. Sullivan and Agent Goodman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They hired my brother to kill Goodman. I was supposed to kill the doctor.\u201d He looked up at Ellie. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d she snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s very personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t testify against them. I wouldn\u2019t last a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re going to prison.\u201d</p><p>Willis started screaming again. \u201cThis hurts bad.\u201d</p><p>Max got up and pulled Ellie to her feet. He had to raise his voice to be heard over Willis\u2019s sobs. \u201cI\u2019m going to change the tire. You\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe SUV is ten feet away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still coming with me. I don\u2019t want you close to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to make a deal. I want a deal,\u201d Willis pleaded.</p><p>Max looked down at him with disgust in his eyes. \u201cWhat can you give me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a shipment coming in from Singapore. Over a thousand guns with enough ammo to cover Iowa. Grenades, too. All sorts of crap. Cal had me on speakerphone, and I heard him tell Erika how big the buy was going to be. Cal likes to brag. I think he forgot I was still on the line. Maybe, anyway. But I know where it\u2019s going down. Get me a deal. I want witness protection.\u201d</p><p>Max kept his reaction contained. Son of a bitch, he thought. Maybe they could get the Landrys once and for all. If Cogburn was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t talk to anyone about this,\u201d Max ordered. \u201cYou understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t,\u201d he groaned. \u201cYou better not talk to your people either. There\u2019s a leak, and if the guy running the investigation hears about me, someone in his office will tell the Landrys, and I\u2019m a dead man.\u201d He started crying again. \u201cI want something for pain. Can I get a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Willis was curled up in a fetal position. His gasps were pathetic as he moaned, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about the doctor. Landrys called off the hit. I was going to act like I didn\u2019t get the text because I knew they\u2019d want their money back, and I could never get away from them. I was going to use the money to run. Honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey paid up front?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf,\u201d he said. His voice was getting weaker. \u201cI can\u2019t take this pain. It\u2019s hurting bad.\u201d</p><p>A few seconds later, Willis passed out.</p><p>Ellie had just pulled the jack from the back of the SUV but dropped it on the ground and ran back. \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>Max shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. He passed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wound isn\u2019t bad,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be in and out of surgery in under an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was in a trauma center, maybe, but this is Winston Falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the surgeons here know what they\u2019re doing. There\u2019s probably one on the way to the hospital now.\u201d</p><p>As it turned out, the small hospital had several surgeons on staff, and one was waiting for Willis. It did take longer than an hour to repair the damage, but not by much.</p><p>Max had signed Willis in under another name. As soon as Clark got word of the shooting, he had turned around and come back to Winston Falls. He and Hershey stood guard outside recovery while Max explained what Cogburn had told him.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure he was telling the truth?\u201d Hershey asked.</p><p>Max handed him Willis\u2019s cell phone. \u201cSee for yourself.\u201d</p><p>All of them were concerned about the leak. \u201cDo you think it could be Hughes?\u201d Clark asked.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be something? He\u2019s been acting like a maniac going after the Landrys,\u201d Hershey said.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s someone in his office. He checks in all the time to update them.\u201d Clark made the comment.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let Hughes find out who the leak is after we trap the Landrys. Until then, we can\u2019t take any chances. No one in Hughes\u2019s office can know about the shipment,\u201d Max cautioned.</p><p>\u201cNot even Hughes,\u201d Hershey added, nodding.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of maniacs, where\u2019s Evan Patterson?\u201d Clark asked.</p><p>Ellie had been sitting in the surgical waiting room for the past hour. Max had ordered her not to move while he went to check on Cogburn, but she couldn\u2019t wait any longer. She had to find out what was going on. Max saw her looking out and motioned for her to join them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hershey knew she\u2019d heard their conversation about Patterson. He looked concerned when he said, \u201cBeing in the same hospital with him has to make you nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cOne of Sheriff Bennett\u2019s deputies is keeping Patterson company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPatterson\u2019s having a CAT scan,\u201d Clark told her. \u201cHe\u2019s been screaming about pain in his head, so they\u2019re scanning him. The sheriff wants to do everything by the book, which means Patterson has to be treated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a damn thing wrong with him,\u201d Max said.</p><p>\u201cExcept he\u2019s frickin\u2019 crazy when it comes to Ellie,\u201d Hershey interjected.</p><p>\u201cHe already tried the chest pain route. There was nothing wrong with his heart. He knows his rights, and he\u2019s playing it for all it\u2019s worth. He\u2019s just looking for a way out, that\u2019s all,\u201d Clark said. The agent then turned the subject back to the Landrys. \u201cHow do we get Cogburn a deal so he\u2019ll cooperate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d Max answered. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to my partner and let him take it to our superior. He\u2019ll decide what kind of deal Cogburn gets.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes your boss have the clout?\u201d Clark asked. \u201cOr does he have to go higher up? The more people who know about this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has the clout,\u201d Max assured him. \u201cHe...\u201d</p><p>Max didn\u2019t finish. Two loud pops echoed up the stairwell. The agents knew the sound. Gunshots. A second later an alarm sounded. It was a low, pulsating noise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the south staircase,\u201d Clark shouted as he pulled his gun free.</p><p>Hershey yelled that he had the other staircase and sprinted down the long hallway.</p><p>A nurse poked her head out of a patient\u2019s room as Max grabbed Ellie. The woman shouted, \u201cThe hospital is in lockdown. Get out of the hall,\u201d and then pulled the door closed.</p> <p>Max pushed Ellie into a room at the end of the hall. \u201cKeep the door shut.\u201d</p><p>D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, she thought. Max was once again pushing her and telling her to hide.</p><p>She didn\u2019t give a second thought to who was firing the gun. It was Patterson. Had to be. People didn\u2019t realize how strong and cunning he was, and that gave him the advantage. It was Patterson, all right. And he was on a rampage.</p><p>Her heart sank, but it wasn\u2019t because of her own danger. Her concern was for Max. He had followed Clark down the stairs. How could she hide in a room if there was a possibility he could get hurt?</p><p>She leaned into the door and strained to hear. She opened it a crack. It was deathly still. Then laughter... eerie laughter. Patterson had gotten upstairs. How close was he? She opened the door just enough to peek down the hall. She nearly fell to her knees. At the end of the hall just outside the door to the stairs lay Hershey. He was facedown on the floor, and Patterson was standing over him, laughing. He must have surprised Hershey when he opened the door to the stairwell.</p><p>Patterson held a gun in his hand. He raised it and pointed it at Hershey\u2019s head. Ellie had to act. She opened the door wide and stepped out. He was at the opposite end of the long hallway, and his back was to her.</p><p>Her voice was strong. \u201cEvan. Come get me. Come on, Evan. Turn around.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head and slowly turned. The grin on his face when he saw her sent chills down her spine.</p> <p>Ellie had a split-second plan. If he raised his gun, she was going to dive around the corner, and if he came running at her, she would try to fend him off until help came. One thing was certain. She couldn\u2019t let him kill Agent Hershey.</p><p>His freaky grin terrified her when he said, \u201cIt\u2019s you. It\u2019s really you.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for what seemed an eternity, and then he raised the gun.</p><p>Before she had time to react, Max was in front of her, firing his gun. Patterson fired a scant half second later. His bullet struck a light fixture as he dropped backward. He went down hard, but he still had the gun in his hand. He was bringing it up when Max fired again. He ran toward Patterson, his gaze locked on the weapon Patterson still clutched in his hand. Patterson wasn\u2019t moving. Max reached him, ripped the gun away, and checked his pulse. He was dead. Max pushed him off Hershey and shouted for assistance.</p><p>Ellie ran forward, slid to her knees, and took over. She saw the welt on Hershey\u2019s head, but fortunately he hadn\u2019t been shot. She gently rolled him onto his back as he groaned and slowly opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe might have a concussion,\u201d she said.</p><p>Max was astounded by how calm she was. \u201cWhy, in God\u2019s name, didn\u2019t you stay in that room?\u201d He was so angry, he could barely keep himself from shouting at her. \u201cYou could have been killed. Do you understand? I could have lost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice. I saw that Patterson was about to shoot Agent Hershey in the back of the head. He was bringing his gun around and laughing, so I tried to distract him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDistract him?\u201d He nearly choked on the words.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI stepped into the hall and called to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a...\u201d He threaded his fingers through his hair. \u201cSon of a... You deliberately made yourself a target.\u201d</p><p>Ellie had never seen Max so out of control. She didn\u2019t think it was a good idea to try to explain her spontaneous plan. She knew he wouldn\u2019t respond well if she told him she intended to call Patterson\u2019s name and then run.</p><p>Fortunately, she didn\u2019t have to suffer his wrath long. The hallway filled with doctors and nurses. Aides rolled two gurneys toward them. Forgetting where she was, she rattled off orders to two nurses who were staring at her as though she\u2019d lost her mind.</p><p>One of the nurses looked at her with a puzzled expression, and Ellie recognized her. Her name was Natalie, and Ellie had gone to school with her for a short time.</p><p>\u201cWhy is she giving us orders?\u201d another nurse asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Natalie answered. \u201cShe\u2019s Ellie Sullivan. She does modeling in New York.\u201d</p><p>Ellie began to laugh. Oh God, now she was a model.</p><p>A doctor stepped forward and gave the same orders. He put his hand out to Ellie to help her stand. Max blocked him and pulled her to her feet.</p><p>Clark ran up the stairs, panting. \u201cThe deputy\u2019s out cold,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re taking care of him downstairs. The technician said the deputy was taking the handcuffs off. You can\u2019t wear them while you\u2019re getting a scan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich Patterson knew,\u201d Max said.</p><p>Clark nodded. \u201cHe overpowered the deputy, got his gun, and started shooting. The technician dived under his desk and stayed there while Patterson shot out the glass. What happened to Hershey?\u201d</p><p>One of the nurses pointed to the camera mounted at the ceiling. \u201cEverything was recorded. You can watch it and find out.\u201d</p><p>The last thing Ellie wanted to do was replay what had happened. She looked down at Patterson and felt sick to her stomach. In death, the maniacal expression was gone. He looked almost peaceful.</p><p>The nightmare really was over.</p><p>THIRTY \u2013 FOUR</p><p>Max and Ellie spent the night in a hotel close to the airport. They didn\u2019t check into their room until late that evening because of all the commotion at the hospital. Hershey and Clark had insisted on watching the surveillance tape. Then there were hours of questions, and papers to be filled out, and by the time Max and Ellie got back on the road, it was too late to catch their scheduled flight. At the hotel, Ellie showered and fell into the king-size bed exhausted.</p><p>Max was on the phone with Ben until after midnight. They were brainstorming, wanting to make certain they had a concrete plan in place to take down the Landrys. They couldn\u2019t afford any screwups or leaks. When he finally got into bed, Max\u2019s mind was racing, yet, once he took Ellie into his arms, he relaxed and fell into a deep sleep. Sometime during the night Ellie woke up and reached for Max. They made love and fell back asleep with their legs entwined.</p><p>They were able to get an early flight back to St. Louis. Clark\u2019s office had arranged the tickets and had notified the carrier that an FBI agent with a loaded weapon would be going through security. Max carried the necessary papers and badge with him.</p><p>Clark reported that Agent Hershey had a bad headache, but other than that, he was good to go. He and Clark were responsible for keeping Willis Cogburn alive and calm until the deal was done. Once his anesthetic had worn off, Cogburn had given them the time and place for what Hershey was calling the deal of the century. Since the Landrys had been in such a hurry to sneak back to Hawaii, everyone had bet that Honolulu was where the meeting would take place, and they were right. The Landrys were going to meet with the gun smugglers in a warehouse smack in the middle of the city.</p><p>Max barely said a word to Ellie the entire morning. She knew he was still upset about what she\u2019d done in the hospital, but she wasn\u2019t in the mood to placate him.</p><p>Both of them remained quiet on the ride to the airport, but once they had boarded the plane and had fastened their seat belts, Max decided to let her have it. He closed his eyes for a minute to gather his thoughts, and then in a low voice said, \u201cIt\u2019s my job to protect you, not the other way around. Do you realize what could have happened in that hallway? If I had been two seconds late, you\u2019d be dead. Patterson would have killed you. What if I had decided to go up the north staircase? I would have been too damn late, wouldn\u2019t I? And I would have found you on the floor, bleeding out. Son of a bitch, Ellie, you scared the hell out of me.\u201d He finally turned to look at her to see her reaction. Then he shook his head and whispered, \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Her deep breathing and closed eyes said it all. She hadn\u2019t heard a word.</p><p>THIRTY \u2013 FIVE</p><p>Max said good-bye to Ellie at the airport, and because he was in such a hurry to catch another flight to Honolulu, he didn\u2019t have time to do more than give her a quick see-you-around kiss.</p><p>He was in a hurry, she reminded herself. Otherwise, he surely would have said something sweet in parting, wouldn\u2019t he? Come to think of it, Max had never said anything sweet to her in the past, so why would she think he would start now?</p><p>Since she had left her car in the Wheatleys\u2019 garage, she took a cab to their house and then decided she might as well spend the night. Millie and Oliver wanted to hear all about her visit home. Ellie glossed over the horror that had taken place inside the Winston Falls hospital. She told them that Patterson was dead and that she hoped he was finally at peace.</p><p>Then she told them about Ava\u2019s garden party, and by the time she finished, they were laughing so hard, tears streamed down their cheeks.</p><p>Millie kept saying, \u201cPoor Ava,\u201d and then she\u2019d go into fits of laughter again.</p><p>After dinner, Ellie went up to her room and called Ava. Her sister, as cranky as she was, deserved a little sympathy.</p><p>Ava answered with, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be rude, Ava. Patterson\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have been a wonderful garden party.\u201d</p><p>Ava agreed and began to talk about the details for the wedding. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean what I said about staying away. I still expect you to be in the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Ellie didn\u2019t make any promises. She listened as Ava described the flowers and the music and even the table settings for the reception. Ellie knew what she was going to have to do, spend a fortune on another airline ticket, put on a black dress, and walk down the aisle for her sister. It didn\u2019t matter whether Ellie wanted to or not; it was the right thing to do.</p><p>She was glad she went. It was a quick and expensive weekend by Ellie\u2019s standards, but she was happy she got to spend more time with Annie and her parents. Her mother was thrilled that Ellie had stopped being stubborn and had finally agreed to be in Ava\u2019s wedding. Ava did make a beautiful bride. She was still obnoxious, but beautiful, all the same.</p><p>Once Ellie was back in her apartment, she became restless and out of sorts. She could go anywhere and do anything now that she wasn\u2019t hiding from Patterson. There was only one little problem-she didn\u2019t have the faintest idea where she belonged. And oh God, how she missed Max.</p><p>She went back to the familiar. Dr. Westfield patted her on her shoulder, which was an effusive gesture for him, and said, \u201cWell done, Prod, well done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, now that I\u2019ve won the Chapman, will you please stop calling me Prod.\u201d</p><p>Because he was so happy about the money his department would receive, in a weak moment, he agreed. He also accepted the fact that she wasn\u2019t going to sign a contract but would fill in for a little while.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do week by week until you come to your senses and sign a contract,\u201d Westfield said, always wanting to have the last word.</p><p>One week passed and then another, and still no word from Max. Ellie went though all the emotions: anger, frustration, misery, and anger again.</p><p>Addison texted her on a regular basis-they were becoming good friends-but the only comment she\u2019d made about Max was that he and Ben were doing undercover work for what Ben had told her was a special project.</p><p>At least once a day, Ellie told herself she was over him, and she desperately wanted to believe that, someday, it would be true.</p><p>She threw herself into her work. It was late on a Thursday afternoon, and she had just finished removing a ruptured gallbladder from a knife attack. She was heading to her locker to change when she saw Carlos Garcia\u2019s wife in the waiting room. She went in to say hello. The news was good, but Carlos had to go through a round of chemo before he could be released from the hospital. Ellie walked into his private room just as he was waking up. She was pleased to hear that his doctors were treating him so well. Amazing what a little blackmail could do.</p><p>Ellie was able to get through the days without thinking about Max, but as soon as she got home, he jumped into her thoughts. Sleep became difficult, a problem she had never had before. Misery. The word was synonymous with Max Daniels.</p><p>THIRTY \u2013 SIX</p><p>Max was having a hell of a great day. Seeing Cal and Erika Landry down on their knees with their hands cuffed behind their backs was a thing of beauty.</p><p>Seven federal agents and twelve policemen surrounded the couple. The dealers, eight of them, were facedown on the cement floor with their hands behind their backs, but without a doubt, the Landrys were the stars of the show.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to try to put hits out on all of us?\u201d Ben asked. He was so happy, he couldn\u2019t stop smiling.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019ve run out of hit men,\u201d Max said.</p><p>Five crates filled with weapons and explosives-some he and Max had never seen before-were being opened and inspected. None of them would reach the streets now, and he was confident Cal and Erika Landry were going away for a long, long time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Using his phone, Max took a photo of the unhappy couple as they screamed obscenities and claimed entrapment. He sent the photo to Agent Sean Goodman and Agent Rob Hughes.</p><p>Exactly one minute after receiving the picture, Agent Hughes was on the line. Max explained to the flabbergasted agent that he had been kept out of the loop because there was a leak in his office. At first, Hughes didn\u2019t take the news well, denying any possibility that there could be a traitor among his ranks. Max told him what the investigation by the special task force had turned up, that one of the assistants in Hughes\u2019s office was selling information to the Landrys for sizable amounts of money, but Hughes was still skeptical. However, when Max named the assistant and the number of cash payments that had been traced to a hidden account, Hughes relented. He was sickened that he hadn\u2019t been more astute. Max told Hughes that special agents from the task force would appear in his office momentarily to make the arrest, and Hughes agreed to assist.</p><p>The next day Hughes was on a plane to Honolulu. Since he had been chasing the Landrys for years and had the longest history with the facts, he was needed to help prepare the case. The FBI and the federal prosecutors were determined to leave no stone unturned. After looking at all the new evidence, Hughes strongly urged they add other counts to the weapons charges. With the testimony of Willis Cogburn, he insisted, they should be able to add on convictions for the attempted murder of Sean Goodman and also for ordering the murder of Dr. Ellie Sullivan.</p><p>\u201cI want to get them for all of it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The prosecuting attorney agreed.</p><p>\u201cWillis Cogburn testifies and then goes into witness protection,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be necessary,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way a judge will allow these two to get out on bail to do their dirty work this time. We\u2019ll watch them closely. Potential witnesses won\u2019t have to be afraid. Dr. Eleanor Sullivan will have to testify, and I want Agent Goodman on call. Get all of them over here as soon as possible. The preliminary trial date has been moved up. Landrys\u2019 gaggle of attorneys isn\u2019t objecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t they?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>The attorney shook her head. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to find out.\u201d</p> <p>Max and Ben celebrated the arrest of the Landrys over a couple of beers at their favorite bar, and Max showed him the picture he\u2019d taken of the angry couple as they knelt in front of the agents and policemen with drawn guns.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d gotten one of their faces when the agents first rushed into that warehouse,\u201d Ben said. \u201cTheir expressions were priceless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey looked shocked, all right,\u201d Max said. \u201cI especially liked the way Erika tried to feign innocence at first. I fully expected her to say she had no idea how those guns got there.\u201d</p><p>Ben raised his mug. \u201cHere\u2019s to the Landrys. May their punishment fit their crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d Max said.</p><p>Ben downed the rest of his beer and stood. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get home. I promised Addison we could have a quiet dinner with just the two of us tonight. I\u2019ve been away so much lately.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow is she feeling?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cThe baby is kicking a lot. She\u2019s convinced he\u2019s going to come out carrying a soccer ball. Ellie\u2019s been terrific, texting Addison whenever she has concerns. Speaking of Ellie... have you talked to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s one in a million. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t let her get away,\u201d Ben said as he headed for the door.</p><p>Max sat for a while, sipping his beer and mulling over Ben\u2019s words. In truth, every minute he wasn\u2019t focusing on the Landry case, he was thinking of her. It had been just a few weeks since he\u2019d seen Ellie, but it seemed like months. He missed her.</p><p>What the hell had happened to him? The woman had blindsided him. She got right into his heart before he knew what was happening. He\u2019d never felt this way before, and he didn\u2019t like it one damned bit. It made him vulnerable.</p><p>Don\u2019t get attached. That\u2019s what she\u2019d told him, and she was right. There were hundreds of reasons they couldn\u2019t be together. The most obvious, they lived four thousand miles apart. Her life was centered on her career, and so was his. Their jobs were stressful and consuming. He couldn\u2019t ask her to live with the danger that surrounded him, nor could he ask her to rearrange her life to fit his. No, it would never work.</p><p>THIRTY \u2013 SEVEN</p> <p>Ellie wasn\u2019t given the choice to go to Honolulu or to stay home. Agent Goodman called her and explained that he and she were taking a flight out in four days. He believed that should give Ellie plenty of time to notify the hospital that she would be away for at least one week but probably two.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if I refuse to go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you refuse to go to one of the most beautiful cities in the world?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cBut if I did refuse?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>\u201cThe prosecuting attorney would make it legal and force you. You don\u2019t want to make her do all that paperwork, do you?\u201d</p><p>She really didn\u2019t have a choice. Getting away from the hospital turned out not to be such a big deal, but figuring out what to pack was a colossal pain. Ellie didn\u2019t have enough clothes in her closet to wear for one week, let alone two on an island. Her bathing suit-providing she could find it-was at least ten years old. She lived in scrubs, not sarongs and little island print dresses.</p><p>Swallowing her pride, she called Ava and explained her dilemma. Her sister had just gotten back from her honeymoon, so she was somewhat pleasant, and she loved having Ellie at her mercy. After complaining about Ellie\u2019s odd figure-she was a perfect size six except for her chest-she took the opportunity to give advice. Ava told her she was overendowed and should consider a breast reduction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be a size four if you did,\u201d Ava said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be built like a mannequin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClothes drape beautifully on mannequins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t help it if you won\u2019t take constructive criticism. I\u2019ll go through the boutique and send everything you need, everything but undies and nightgowns, so spend a little money and buy some. I know you have it. Mom told me you paid off most of your loans with the money from that award and that you put twenty thousand dollars in their household account. There was a huge fight because Dad didn\u2019t want to take it, but Mom won and said the money would help with their grandchild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did they take the news that they were going to be grandparents?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. Shocked at first because it was the good twin.\u201d</p><p>Ellie laughed. \u201cBut now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery excited,\u201d she said. \u201cDad\u2019s looking for a crib.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, don\u2019t let him find a deal. Make him buy retail.\u201d</p><p>They talked about Annie and the help she was going to need to get through the pregnancy, and then Ellie said, \u201cI appreciate your help with the clothes. Send me the bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to buy shoes, Ellie. And for God\u2019s sake, accessorize. Little strappy sandals and flats will work with what I\u2019m going to send. I\u2019ll toss in some cool hoop earrings and bracelets. And, Ellie, promise me you\u2019ll wear the short royal blue dress I\u2019m sending. I\u2019m looking at it right now. You\u2019ll be stunning. Promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cI promise... unless it\u2019s lewd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late. You already promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means it\u2019s lewd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, just a little low-cut. I\u2019m sending everything overnight, so let me hang up and start packing what you\u2019ll need. I\u2019m betting you won\u2019t have to have any alterations.\u201d</p><p>After she ended the call, Ellie checked the time and decided to drive over to Frontenac shopping center. Traffic was backed up on the highway, so she took side streets through Clayton and got there in twenty minutes. She parked in front of Neiman Marcus, ran in and purchased the undies and gowns she needed. She even splurged on a short silk robe. The store was having a shoe sale, and Ellie was able to get the sandals, flats, and a gorgeous pair of red stiletto heels she doubted she would ever wear. But she just had to have them because they were 70 percent off and looked great on her feet.</p><p>Was she turning into her dad? If it\u2019s a deal, get it regardless?</p><p>She told herself she wasn\u2019t getting new clothes to impress or entice Max. No, of course not. She needed the clothes because she had decided to start dating again, to get a social life outside the hospital. She would learn to have fun even if it killed her. When was the last time she had gone out to a club? A year ago? More like three years, she realized. Even then, she\u2019d gone home before the party really got started. She\u2019d preferred her bed to jumping up and down to shrieking music.</p><p>Thursday morning she returned to Neiman Marcus to pick up her alterations. She had found a beautiful Armani summer fitted jacket and a pair of slacks and a skirt to wear with it. If she had to go into court, either outfit would be more than appropriate. She asked the alterations lady to pack the clothes in tissue so that all Ellie would have to do would be to unzip her suitcase and put everything inside.</p><p>Millie insisted on driving her to the airport, and she kept up the conversation most of the way.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t mentioned Max,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m over him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Millie said. Ellie could hear the smile in her voice.</p><p>\u201cAlmost three weeks, Millie, and not one word. He just walked away, and I\u2019m doing the same. I told him not to get attached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your reasons for trying to keep your distance have changed, haven\u2019t they?\u201d Millie asked. \u201cYour life isn\u2019t out of control any longer. Patterson is dead. Doesn\u2019t that change things?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer the question but said, \u201cHe lives in Honolulu, and I live here.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately for Ellie, they had reached the airport, and Millie couldn\u2019t prod her any longer to be reasonable.</p><p>Sean was waiting for her at the boarding gate. Ellie was surprised their seats were in first class and wondered what that had cost. She certainly didn\u2019t balk at the expense, though. The seats were much wider than in coach, and there was more leg room. She had carried her laptop with her and planned to read a couple of medical journals on the flight and maybe even watch a replay of the 2000 Super Bowl that she\u2019d downloaded. She\u2019d thought it would be fun to watch Kurt Warner lead St. Louis to victory again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get to Honolulu at eight tonight, which is midnight our time,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cWill Max and Ben be at the airport?\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop herself from asking.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThey\u2019re in Maui. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be back until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have they been doing for the past three weeks?\u201d she asked casually. It had actually been two weeks and five days, but she thought, if she gave the exact amount of time, Sean would know how much she missed Max.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been undercover in the warehouse most of the time. Long hours wearing dirty clothes.\u201d He added, \u201cIt was worth it, though. They got the Landrys in the middle of making a weapons buy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard. Ben\u2019s wife texted me the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow afternoon is the evidentiary hearing. Landrys\u2019 attorneys are going to try to chip away at the charges. They requested the preliminary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere the Landrys given bail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sean answered. \u201cTheir attorneys will tackle that, too. They\u2019ll try to get them out.\u201d</p><p>Ellie thought about how hard Max and the others had worked to get the Landrys behind bars. Now their well-paid attorneys would attempt to get all the charges thrown out. There was little chance a judge would toss out the weapons charges because the Landrys were caught red-handed. The attempted-murder charges weren\u2019t as clear-cut. She assumed that part of Willis Cogburn\u2019s deal was that he would testify against the Landrys in return for leniency. It would be a new beginning for him, and she wondered if he would take advantage of his second chance and try to become a decent, law-abiding citizen. She had her doubts. From hit man to what? Store clerk? That would take some adjustment.</p><p>Her thoughts moved to Carlos Garcia. He, too, had been given a second chance, and she hoped he would make good choices and grow old with his wife and child.</p><p>Ellie decided to take her mind off all her worries and watch the Super Bowl replay. Sean leaned over the armrest and watched it with her.</p><p>By the time they reached Honolulu, she was ready to stretch her legs. A driver was waiting for them and drove them to their hotel. Ellie\u2019s room was lovely. It had a balcony, and she could see the ocean from it if she leaned out and looked to the left. She could hear the waves from her room, though, and she fell asleep to the soothing sounds of the surf.</p><p>THIRTY \u2013 EIGHT</p><p>Max was pacing in the lobby while he waited for Ellie. Sean had told her to be downstairs at one o\u2019clock, and it was now fifteen minutes to one.</p><p>This was going to be the most difficult thing he had ever done in his life. He was trying to figure out what he was going to say to her. Using cell phones had been out of the question while he and Ben had been undercover, and he didn\u2019t want to talk to her on the phone anyway. He wanted a face-to-face for what he believed was going to be a miserable confrontation.</p><p>Ellie wasn\u2019t going to like what he was going to tell her and, in fact, would probably be furious with him, but it didn\u2019t matter. Even if she didn\u2019t understand, he knew what was best for her-as arrogant as that was.</p><p>He hated upsetting her. God knows, she\u2019d been through enough, but he needed to explain what was on his mind because it was the right thing to do.</p><p>Max turned around and walked to the steps leading down to the pool. His mind raced.</p><p>Ellie stepped off the elevator and was walking across the marble floor of the lobby when she suddenly stopped. Max was standing in front of her. His hands were crammed in the pockets of his suit pants and his back was to her, but it was Max, all right, because her heart was doing that stupid, crazy beating, like a possessed drum.</p><p>Oh God, how was she going to get through this?</p><p>Nice to see you again. Yes, she remembered that\u2019s what she had decided to say. It was dorky, but it was the best she could come up with. Nice to see you. Forget the again, she decided. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMax.\u201d</p><p>He slowly turned around. \u201cEllie.\u201d</p><p>They stood five feet apart staring at each other. She thought he looked tired; he thought she looked beautiful. Neither one of them said a word for what seemed a very long time.</p><p>It dawned on her that he was glaring. She retaliated by doing the same. The only thing missing was a pair of dueling pistols.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to listen to what I have to say,\u201d he said.</p><p>Oh no, had he chosen a public place so she wouldn\u2019t make a scene when he told her he was moving on. She braced herself for heartache. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her. \u201cI love you. We\u2019re getting married, and that\u2019s the way it is. Get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait... what?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand and tried to pull her along. \u201cCome on, we\u2019re going to be late.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait... what did you... wait.\u201d</p><p>He led her into an alcove and repeated word for word what he had just said. Her back was against the marble wall, and he\u2019d braced his hands on either side of her. She wasn\u2019t going anywhere until he let her. She looked shell-shocked.</p><p>\u201cI said, I love you. We\u2019re getting married, and that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. She was having trouble understanding.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do, and you love me. I don\u2019t want to hear any of your \u2018Don\u2019t get attached\u2019 and \u2018Don\u2019t fall in love with me\u2019 nonsense. I\u2019m marrying you, Ellie Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t hear a word from you for a month,\u201d she said, \u201cand now you think you can-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I do think.\u201d He leaned down and kissed her. \u201cYour lips are so soft. You love me. I\u2019ve missed holding you in my arms.\u201d</p><p>She tried to push him away. He was like a boulder that wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cYou don\u2019t tell someone you\u2019re going to marry her. You ask.\u201d</p><p>He tried to kiss her again, but she turned her cheek, and he kissed her earlobe instead. \u201cI asked your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d She sounded breathless. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis exact words? \u2018Oh God, not another wedding.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>The palms of her hands were pressed against his chest. \u201cDid he approve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he did. I offered him a deal he couldn\u2019t refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of a deal?\u201d she whispered, dazed by what was happening. Max loved her. How could such a wonderful thing be happening to her? What had she done to deserve this?</p> <p>\u201cI promised to love you and protect you and do my best to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax, it\u2019s too soon to know if you love me. We haven\u2019t known each other-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should think about-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you. Get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a romantic,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His lips brushed over hers. \u201cI need to hear you tell me you love me.\u201d</p><p>She could see his vulnerability. She put her arms around his neck. \u201cI\u2019ve loved you from the moment I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I can be gruff and abrupt at times,\u201d he confessed. \u201cAnd I admit I\u2019m a little opinionated. And I\u2019m not always sensitive...\u201d</p><p>She put her finger on his lips to stop his litany. \u201cYou\u2019re also caring, honest, kind, gentle...\u201d</p><p>His arrogance was firmly back in place.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m irresistible, huh?\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re the ideal man.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY \u2013 NINE</p><p>Max wished he had been allowed to bring a camera into the courtroom to film Ellie on the witness stand. She made mincemeat out of the two-thousand-dollar-an-hour lawyers and did it with such grace.</p><p>The judge explained that this was an evidentiary hearing to determine which charges would be permitted and which would be thrown out for lack of evidence.</p><p>Ellie sat in the witness box with her hands folded in her lap, a serene expression on her face while she waited for the defense attorneys to try to discredit anything and everything she said.</p><p>Christopher Hammond, the lead attorney, had the most insincere smile she\u2019d ever seen. He was a tall, distinguished-looking man, who, in his designer suit and perfectly knotted silk tie, was elegantly dressed... except for one little flaw.</p><p>The Landrys sat at the defense table, stone-faced. Mrs. Landry in her conservative white blouse and cardigan sweater and Mr. Landry in his navy blue business suit looked the picture of propriety. Ellie had not been in the courtroom during Willis Cogburn\u2019s testimony, but Max had told her how Willis had described in great detail his relationship with the Landrys and then recounted the actions he\u2019d taken under their orders. The slick attorneys did their best to discredit him, but Willis held up under the pressure. After an hour of testimony, he had actually become brave enough to make eye contact with the Landrys.</p><p>Hammond, his hands behind his back and staring at the floor, paced in front of the witness box for a few seconds, weighing his words before addressing Ellie.</p><p>\u201cYou have an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Dr. Sullivan,\u201d he began. \u201cSomeone as young as you a trauma surgeon... and to have received the recognition that you have... very impressive indeed.\u201d</p><p>If he expected her to chitchat, he was mistaken. She simply stared at him and waited. Once Hammond realized he couldn\u2019t charm her, he got down to business. He asked her to tell him what Willis Cogburn had said while she was attending to his injury on the roadside.</p><p>She answered his question but didn\u2019t embellish.</p><p>\u201cDid you believe Mr. Cogburn when he told you he had been hired to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did believe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been established through testimony in this court that Mr. Cogburn has lied on numerous occasions to avoid prosecution. Your reasons for believing a habitual liar?\u201d</p><p>The prosecutor started to object but sat back down as Ellie responded.</p><p>\u201cHe shot at me. So, yes, I believe he was trying to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not here to determine Mr. Cogburn\u2019s actions,\u201d he reminded. \u201cWe are here to determine whether or not Mr. Cogburn was acting under the instructions of Mr. and Mrs. Landry. Do you consider yourself to be observant, Dr. Sullivan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in a terrifying situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWillis Cogburn has admitted firing several shots at your vehicle in an attempt to blow up the fuel tank. Fortunately, he missed, but he did shoot out a tire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a question, or are you just reminiscing?\u201d the prosecutor asked.</p><p>Hammond continued, \u201cDo you remember how many shots were fired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe three shots were fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you claim to be observant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder gunfire, I would think your perceptions would be greatly compromised. You were running for your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d the prosecutor said, \u201cis there a question in Mr. Hammond\u2019s ramblings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ability to assess would be affected, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Ellie looked at the judge, then turned to Hammond. \u201cIf you\u2019ll recall, I\u2019m a trauma surgeon. I\u2019m trained for crisis situations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course you are, but you have to admit this was different. You were being hunted by a crazed man who believed he had been hired to kill you. A delusional gunman.\u201d</p><p>Ellie didn\u2019t respond but waited for another question.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cogburn was in a great deal of pain at the time, was he not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019d been shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell us exactly what you think you heard Mr. Cogburn say while you were treating him.\u201d</p><p>She repeated the conversation again word for word.</p><p>When she was finished, Hammond said, \u201cEven if he had said those words, you do accept that Mr. Cogburn could have been delusional and you could have made an inaccurate assessment as to his state of mind. After all, you\u2019d just gone through a traumatic event yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis eyes were clear, and he was lucid,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThese were your observations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Willis Cogburn wasn\u2019t delusional and he wasn\u2019t lying,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cSo you believe your observations are that accurate?\u201d he asked in a mocking tone.</p><p>Ellie was becoming irritated. Why was the attorney continuing with these inane questions?</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I think I\u2019m very observant,\u201d she said. She should have stopped there, but she couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cI observe that the rash on your left hand isn\u2019t going to get better if you continue to use the same ointment. You\u2019re allergic to it. I observe that the gentleman in the third row on the left has a bad case of conjunctivitis-pinkeye, in layman\u2019s terms. And the woman in the second row has a bag of candies in her purse, and she\u2019s trying to figure out a way to eat them without making noise. They\u2019re M &amp;M\u2019s. I also observe that your associate attorney at the defense table keeps looking at his watch and is very anxious to get out of here because he appears to have something going on with the court reporter.\u201d</p><p>The associate gave a look of panic and then dropped his head, staring at the desk.</p><p>Ellie paused, looked Hammond in the eye, and said, \u201cAnd I observe you\u2019re unzipped.\u201d</p><p>The attorney turned crimson with embarrassment. He hastily zipped his fly.</p><p>\u201cNo more questions.\u201d</p><p>FORTY</p><p>Max and Ellie planned to be married in Minneapolis, eleven months after he proposed. He wasn\u2019t happy about waiting, but as long as she told him she loved him every day and slept in his arms every night, he didn\u2019t complain too much.</p><p>Ellie didn\u2019t want to rush. It was important to her that her family be able to attend. She asked Annie to be her maid of honor. She was the older of the twins by two minutes, so Ellie figured Ava couldn\u2019t throw a fit.</p><p>The wedding was simple but joyful. Annie\u2019s baby girl, Meghan, was almost four months old and smiling all the time. She could usually be found in the crook of her grandfather\u2019s arm. He doted on her. Since Patterson\u2019s death and the birth of his first grandchild, Ellie\u2019s father looked twenty years younger. He\u2019d even started exercising, walking a couple of miles every morning. He was determined to stay fit so that he would be around to watch his granddaughter grow up.</p><p>As a temporary solution, Annie had moved in with her parents until after the baby was born and she could decide what she was going to do with her life. She had passed the bar in California and knew that she would eventually move back to San Diego, but she didn\u2019t have any idea where she wanted to work. Her parents were helping her pay off her student loans, though she vowed she was going to repay every penny.</p><p>Max had kept his promise to her. Through his connections, he discovered the whereabouts of Lucas Ryan, Annie\u2019s lover. An old buddy from the FBI academy linked Max with Michael Buchanan, a Navy Seal, who was currently stationed in San Diego. Buchanan explained that he couldn\u2019t give out any sensitive information, but he\u2019d see what he could do. Within the week, Max got his call. Lucas Ryan had been sent to Afghanistan, and that was all the information Buchanan could give. Max was told nothing about what Ryan was doing there or when he would be home.</p><p>FORTY \u2013 ONE</p><p>One summer morning, with Meghan in her arms, Annie opened the front door, and there he stood, the man who had broken her heart. His left leg was in a cast, and he was using a cane. She wasn\u2019t sympathetic. She wanted to grab the cane and hit him over the head with it. But she also wanted to hug him. She stood there staring up at him and didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what to say. He looked wonderful. Dark hair, dark eyes, tanned face, great body-he was an extremely attractive man. No wonder she had fallen for him. He was tall, dark, and handsome.</p><p>And a snake in the grass who had left her when she needed him most, she reminded herself.</p><p>Lucas seemed as tongue-tied as she was, but he was first to recover.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She stepped back so he could come inside.</p><p>He smiled at the baby as he walked past. \u201cShe\u2019s cute,\u201d he remarked. \u201cAre you babysitting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left me, Lucas. You never called; you never...\u201d</p><p>She stopped because she knew, if she continued, she would start crying. Meghan started to squirm in her arms, and Annie realized she\u2019d raised her voice. She shifted the baby to her other arm and quietly said, \u201cI needed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know that. I couldn\u2019t tell you I was leaving, and I couldn\u2019t contact you. It was a special operation.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t acknowledge his explanation. \u201cWhat happened to your leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShrapnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down and put your foot up,\u201d she ordered. She pushed the ottoman in front of the sofa. \u201cWould you like something to drink before you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving. I know you\u2019re upset, and you have every right, but...\u201d</p><p>She poked him in the chest and, in a soft voice so her daughter wouldn\u2019t become frightened, said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to love you.\u201d</p><p>Tears came into her eyes, and she wanted to curse. The last thing she needed now was to become weepy. There would be plenty of time for that after he left.</p><p>\u201cBut you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>He sat down on the sofa and pulled her onto his lap. She didn\u2019t fight him because she held the baby. Her back was ramrod straight.</p><p>His hand moved to the back of her neck. \u201cHow come you keep getting prettier?\u201d</p><p>A compliment wouldn\u2019t soften her heart, she decided, but the baby was smiling at him and gurgling. He reached out and stroked Meghan\u2019s cheek. She was quick. She grabbed his finger and began to gnaw on it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s teething,\u201d Annie explained.</p><p>Lucas looked around the room with a puzzled expression. \u201cDoes your mom run a day care or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something,\u201d she answered. \u201cAre you still a Navy Seal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cMarry me, Annie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind. Shrapnel hit your head, too, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her toward him and kissed her. His mouth was warm and coaxing. She couldn\u2019t stop herself from responding. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean-\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, and she didn\u2019t resist. She wrapped her arm around his neck and leaned into him. Oh, how she had missed him.</p><p>And shed buckets of tears. No, she wasn\u2019t going to go through that again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a surprise for you,\u201d he said as he reached into his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ve been carrying this around for a year now.\u201d</p><p>It was an engagement ring. Annie stared into his eyes and saw the torment there.</p><p>\u201cAnnie, I\u2019m so sorry I couldn\u2019t tell you. Will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to think about it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a surprise for you, too.\u201d</p><p>She stood, then placed Meghan in his lap. \u201cMeet your daughter.\u201d</p> <p>FORTY \u2013 TWO</p><p>Yet another wedding.</p><p>Ellie was thrilled with Annie\u2019s news and hoped that Lucas\u2019s family was as wonderful as Max\u2019s. Simon had been Max\u2019s best man at the wedding, and his other brothers had been groomsmen. She loved all of them, but she had a special bond with their parents. They were such kind, loving people. Simon had saved Max\u2019s life, and his parents had nurtured him.</p><p>Max\u2019s two-bedroom apartment overlooking the ocean was her home now. Once she was licensed to practice medicine in Hawaii, she went to work at one of the hospitals in the city. Ellie loved watching the weather channel in the dead of winter and laughing every time she heard about another snowstorm in the Midwest. Max remarked that her laughter sounded absolutely ghoulish.</p><p>The Wheatleys, like Max\u2019s parents, had already visited. Everyone who came hated to go home. Who could blame them?</p><p>\u201cWe live in paradise,\u201d she whispered to Max late one night. They were in bed and had just made love.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re still awake?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about the Landrys. Ben told me they were appealing the verdict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what grounds?\u201d he asked, rolling onto his back. He stacked his hands behind his head and yawned. \u201cThat they don\u2019t like life in prison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe judge really gave it to them, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey gave the order to kill you. Life in prison isn\u2019t long enough, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think happened to Greg Roper? After he pointed to those photos of Cal and Erika Landry, he vanished. Do you think he\u2019s still alive? Or did they get to him and kill him? I hope he ran and hid from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance he\u2019s still alive,\u201d he said. \u201cCogburn told us he went to Roper and threatened to kill him and his family if he ever showed his face in St. Louis again. The police still have a missing person\u2019s file active on him, but there\u2019s hope he\u2019ll show up sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d Ellie yawned. She trailed her fingers down Max\u2019s chest and cuddled up against him. \u201cSimon called.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thought he found a lump, but by the time he finished describing it to me, he decided it might be a callus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves having a doctor in the family.\u201d</p><p>She adjusted her pillow and closed her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t forget we\u2019re having dinner with Ben and Addison and little Benjamin this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ellie laid her head on Max\u2019s chest, and he stroked her hair. Since they had just made passionate love, he thought she needed to hear how much she pleased him. \u201cOur marriage...\u201d He paused while he searched for the right words to tell her how happy she made him. \u201cOur marriage...\u201d</p><p>Her deep breathing stopped him.</p><p>Smiling to himself, he pulled the sheet up over her and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s all good.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
